            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Foga and moderator,<br>Once again, I wrestle with whether this is a "state secret" or not, but I hate to burst your bubble. The VT-1 missles have been ordered for the La Fayette class stealth frigates that the RSN are buying. Each frigate has a Crotale CN2 SAM system that uses these VT-1 missiles. Each ship normally carries 24 missiles. The existing SAF SAM umbrella is pretty good and interlocking. Although we do not have the Bloodhounds anymore, we use I-Hawks for long to medium range, than Rapier for area defence, than Igilas, RBS-70s, and various AA guns for short range.Cheers<br><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/notif_db.php?regionin=eapc&amp;ctryin=sgp&amp;descin=&amp;date1in=1998&amp;date2in=2002&amp;typein=%" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/notif_db.php?regionin=eapc&amp;ctryin=sgp&amp;descin=&amp;date1in=1998&amp;date2in=2002&amp;typein=%</a><br><br>read from the above source that singapore have purchase the missiles from france.<br><br>for more about the missile click the link below<br><br>h<a href="http://ttp://www.army-technology.com/projects/crotale/" rel="nofollow">ttp://www.army-technology.com/projects/crotale/</a></strong>[/quote]</div>

The VT-1 missles have been ordered for the La Fayette class stealth frigates that the RSN are buying. Each frigate has a Crotale CN2 SAM system that uses these VT-1 missiles. Each ship normally carries 24 missiles. The existing SAF SAM umbrella is pretty good and interlocking. Although we do not have the Bloodhounds anymore, we use I-Hawks for long to medium range, than Rapier for area defence, than Igilas, RBS-70s, and various AA guns for short range.Cheers </div></blockquote>And I hate to burst your bubble back but:<br><br>- RSN frigates are NOT Lafayette class. It is a design related to but different from the Lafayette class<br><br>- One of the few facts to have emerged from the RSN frigate purchase is that the SAM system would be the Aster 15<br><br>- The AD systems you've mentioned are all obsolete. Full stop. Rapier, RBS-70 and I-Hawk are all 1970s era designs. It was ok when regional threats were reduced to using older aircraft and dumb bombs. Now that PGMs and 4th generation aircraft are making an appearance, all these systems should be thrown out into the junkyard where they belong.</div>

Thank you Viper for clearing this up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I'm still puzzled why ADSD went for VT1 given it was designed in the 80s albeit that its performance is considered super even till today. Why not use VLS Barak instead?<br><br>I also believe in having a LAV-AD type AD system. The Gatling is a good backup for VSHORAD.<br><br>Finally it is interesting that the ADF when for an upgraded RBS 70 with PSTAR instead. I wonder if ADSD will follow suit?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MAJOR AIR DEFENCE BOOST FOR AUSTRALIA<br><br>The Federal Government has today signed an $83 million contract to dramatically boost AustraliaÂ’s ground based air defence capability.<br><br>The contract with Saab Systems Australia is to supply short-range laser guided missile systems to the Australian Army which will effectively double AustraliaÂ’s ground based air defence capability operating out of Woodside 16h Air Defence Regiment in South Australia.<br><br>Minister for Defence Robert Hill said the Government has agreed to purchase additional RBS70 weapons systems and Portable Search and Target Acquisition Radars. The project will also upgrade the existing RBS70 systems and replace the Rapier systems.<br><br>"The RBS70 is the most modern man-portable Short Range Air Defence system available in the world. It offers very effective protection against low level aircraft and helicopters and its laser rangefinder and optical sighting system is immune to radar jamming," Senator Hill said.<br><br>"A version of the system has been in service with the Australian Army for 15 years. A troop of about 24 personnel is currently on operation in the Persian Gulf providing point air defence to HMAS Kanimbla and will return to Australia in July."<br><br>Saab Systems is an Adelaide-based company specialising in high technology military systems and has very good track record in a number of significant Defence projects in Australia and overseas. It currently employs about 250 people, and this contract will generate up to 10 full time additional positions.<br><br>The RBS70 weapon systems will be supplied by Saab Bofors Dynamics of Sweden. This will be integrated with surveillance and target acquisition radar supplied by Lockheed Martin in the United States. A new command and control system will be developed by Saab Systems Australia to more effectively manage and integrate AustraliaÂ’s ground based air defence systems.<br><br>"While the weapon launchers and radars will be manufactured overseas, the prime contract with the Adelaide-based Saab Systems will provide opportunities for local industry involvement, particularly in the production and through life support for the Command and Control System," Senator Hill said.<br><br>"This latest contract will complement other developments in air defence, including the forthcoming construction of a RBS70 simulator system at Woodside to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of soldier air defence training.<br><br>"It will also deliver another of the GovernmentÂ’s White Paper promises and will ensure that the Army maintains a credible short range air defence capability when the aging Rapier system reaches the end of its life from around mid 2005."</div>
