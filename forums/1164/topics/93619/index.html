            <div class='col-md body'>No, Palms/Pocket PCs are NOT allowed in SAF camps unless prior approval has been sought, otherwise known as an Letter of Authority (LOA) as these are classifed as storage devices. In this group would include thumb drives, CD-burners, camera phones, video cameras,laptops, so on and so forth and if they want to be *REALLY* fussy, MP3 players (tho' it would be unlikely).<br><br>Way around this? Wait till you are posted to your unit and apply for an LOA which has to be recommended by your immediate superior (OC/PSOs/Br Hds) and signed by your Comd/CO. Depending on your vocation/appt, you can throw smoke and say you need your palm to organise your activities *blah**blah**blah* Oh yes, the form for this LOA can be found in the GOM, check with your chief clerk.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>
