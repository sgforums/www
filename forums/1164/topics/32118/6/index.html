I totally agree with you about some comments made here.  Some were made by individuals who have never posted in this forum before.  Armed with a bit of military jargon.  This lot comes here and made nonsense posts.  A few are just young kids with no NS background.  The most digusting were the comments questioning the SAR mission. Any SAF, SPF or SCDF regular, NSF or NSmen will go all the way to assist another colleague in times of danger. Personal grudges are put aside to help each other.  As a NSman, I feel insulted by these comments questioning the professionalism and dedication of the men and women helping out in the SAR.</div>

They are only on the bridge during special times like special sea duty and other operations. This is NOT the merchant navy. The person responsible for the safety of the ship is the Officer of the Watch.<br><br>Navigational radars are ALWAYS on at sea. This is a maritime patrol, not an exercise and there is no such thing as electronic emission restriction policies during maritime patrols.<br><br>The merchant vessel struck the aft mess of the ship and sheared off part of it.

If the merchant vessel hit just 5-10 m ahead, chances are that Courageous would have split into two and sank just like how Titanic sank.<br><br>The naval force sent to the accident site is STANDARD.
