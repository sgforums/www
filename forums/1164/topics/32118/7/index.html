I totally agree with you about some comments made here.  Some were made by individuals who have never posted in this forum before.  Armed with a bit of military jargon.  This lot comes here and made nonsense posts.  A few are just young kids with no NS background.  The most digusting were the comments questioning the SAR mission. Any SAF, SPF or SCDF regular, NSF or NSmen will go all the way to assist another colleague in times of danger. Personal grudges are put aside to help each other.  As a NSman, I feel insulted by these comments questioning the professionalism and dedication of the men and women helping out in the SAR.</div></blockquote>put it this way. this unfortunate event and discussion urged these peoples to register. you might want to orientate/guide them instead of running them down. to them, read the newspaper or watch tv and takes things here with a pinch of salt. and speculation leads nowhere.</div>

While some of the things said in previous posts are correct, many are terribly wrong and distorted.<br><br>Commanding Officers of warships throughout the world DO NOT keep normal watches. They are only on the bridge during special times like special sea duty and other operations. This is NOT the merchant navy. The person responsible for the safety of the ship is the Officer of the Watch.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> always thought it was the same. . .hmmm, thanx for pointing this out to me and correcting my 'info'. . . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> another thing, I wanna ask if captain does not keep normal watches, then what does he do? esp. when the ship is on routine patrol duties, which will be the case most of the time???<br><br>Navigational radars are ALWAYS on at sea. This is a maritime patrol, not an exercise and there is no such thing as electronic emission restriction policies during maritime patrols.<br><br>The merchant vessel struck the aft mess of the ship and sheared off part of it. As mentioned earlier, it is already a miracle that the ship didn't sink. If the merchant vessel hit just 5-10 m ahead, chances are that Courageous would have split into two and sank just like how Titanic sank.<br><br>The naval force sent to the accident site is STANDARD. A similar force was sent in 1997 to the Silkair crash. Taking care of our people is paramount. To imply that we are not performing SAR ops to the best of our capabilities is an insult to the name of the SAF and to our men and women still out there NOW.<br><br>Please learn your facts before you talk and do not mislead others<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> sure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Accidents are accidents. I weep as the 3 bodies are found with 1 still missing - hope shes alive.  It is sad as we watch the news of how these 3 specialists died on the course of duty to the nation.  It bring to us the reality that defence of a nation depends on everyone - men and women alike -   these 4 female soldiers are perfect examples. though not in a war, let us  pay our respects to these soldiers who devoted their lives to do something that most  of us guys only knew to complain about.<br><br>Sure, there is always someone to blame when accidents happen. Issit the CO? The Officer on watch? the crew on duty? the merchant ship? The unfortunate thing here is that, barring it is a deliberate attempt, no one, absolutely NO ONE on both ships would want this to happen, so while we mourn the  passing of 3  lives, let us remember that those living would have to live with these  painful memories for the rest of their lives. Lets make it easier for them.<br><br>Some pple merely existed. Some lived their lives. These soldeirs lived.</div>
