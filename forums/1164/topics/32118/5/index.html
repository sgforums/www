            <div class='col-md body'>From the straitstimes website:<br><blockquote><br>Tension mounted as the day wore on with rescuers searching for the four women specialists trapped in the back of the RSS Courageous.<br><br>K. C. VIJAYAN reports on how cautious optimism gave way to a warning to be prepared for the worst.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>FRIDAY<br>11.35PM<br><br>BOW of container vessel ANL Indonesia sails out of Singapore Straits and rams into the rear of RSS Courageous on its right side.<br><br>RSS Courageous has been on a routine patrol since morning while the ANL Indonesia is heading towards Busan, South Korea, after leaving Port Klang on Friday.<br><br>The collision occurs about 1.5 km north-west of Pedra Branca. The impact of a larger ship of more than 50,000 gross tonne weight and a vessel less than half its size, weighing 460 tonnes is tremendous.<br><br>The anti-submarine craft's rear is sheared off. The aft caves inwards. Even the mast tower is damaged.<br><br>A Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) spokesman says weather conditions allow for clear visibility at the time. Traffic flow in the area was normal, she adds.<br><br>Four women naval specialists, aged between 22 and 25, asleep in a rear compartment, are trapped. The ship begins to list and water floods the two compartments adjoining the trapped women's room.<br><br>Eight other men from the 44-strong crew on board are injured slightly.<br><br>FRIDAY<br>11.40PM<br><br>ALERTED, the Defence Ministry sends first rescue helicopter from Sembawang Air Base.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, six Republic of Singapore Navy ships, three Police Coast Guard craft, four tug boats and a ferry move in to help.<br><br>Efforts to locate the trapped four involve a difficult and complicated operation, requiring the ship to be stabilised first to prevent it from sinking.<br><br>ANL Indonesia notifies MPA. It does not seek assistance as it only suffers a slight dent on its front.<br><br>MPA sends two fire-fighting craft to area.<br><br>SATURDAY<br>5.30AM<br><br>EIGHT injured crewman admitted to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>They are conveyed by Police Coast Guard craft to Changi Ferry Point and then ferried to the hospital.<br><br>Five are discharged by noon while the remaining three - First Sergeants Koh Tze Ann, 26, Ang Wee Soon, 27, and Second Sergeant Tan Meng Wah, 24 - are warded for observation.<br><br>SATURDAY<br>7.15AM<br><br>ANL Indonesia with 23-man crew of 12 Dutchmen and 11 Indonesians on board drops anchor at Eastern Anchorage waters, some 4 km from Sentosa.<br><br>The agent for the ship's owner, P&amp;0 Nedlloyd, says damage is minor and the ship is ready to continue its voyage but is remaining to assist in investigations.<br><br>SATURDAY<br>12.15PM<br><br>DEPUTY Prime Minister and Defence Minister Tony Tan accompanied by Second Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean and senior Mindef officers hold a press conference.<br><br>He says RSS Courageous is being towed back to Changi Naval Base while search and rescue efforts are continuing at the collision scene with additional Air Force and Navy craft.<br><br>'We are doing everything possible on the ship and hope to complete the rescue operation as soon as possible. We share the distress of the families of the four servicewomen who are still unaccounted for and are doing our utmost.'<br><br>He says he does not want to speculate on the condition or location of the women.<br><br>SATURDAY<br>2.30PM<br><br>EVEN as search efforts continue at the collision site, the RSS Courageous arrives in tow at Changi Naval Base.<br><br>It is lifted up in a dry area and water drains from the ship to allow rescuers to enter the severely damaged compartments.<br><br>SATURDAY<br>5.15PM<br><br>DR TAN, after inspecting the wrecked vessel, tells reporters that divers have found the body of one servicewoman inside. She is found lodged between the bunks.<br><br>Search operations at the crash site will continue, he says, while divers continue to pry the crunched rear of the vessel to locate the other three women.<br><br>'We need to take further time to ascertain the location of the other three servicewomen,' he adds.<br><br>He does not think the load of the ship, with 44 crew members on board, instead of its capacity of 32 people, had a bearing on the collision.<br><br>Acknowledging that hopes are fading, he says: 'We must be prepared for the worst. Our hearts go out to the families of the four servicewomen.<br><br>'We have had severe accidents in the past.<br><br>'In terms of possible loss of life, this is the largest loss of life in a single accident that the RSN has encountered.'<br><br>AT PRESS TIME<br><br>A MINDEF spokesman says operations are continuing both on the ship and the crash site to look for the missing three women.<br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shipping lawyers say there are international regulations to prevent collisions, which are set by the London-based International Maritime Organisation and adopted by seafaring nations.<br><br>In fact, any ship found to be responsible for a collision can be fined up to $10,000 here, under the Merchant Shipping Act.<br><br>Some of the laws state, for instance, that radar equipment should be used for early warning signs of a collision.<br><br>In busy shipping lanes, ships are also supposed to travel at speeds which would allow them to avoid collisions.<br><br>Ships also have to stick to their lanes, but if for some reason they wish to cross lanes, they have to do so at a right angle to the flow of traffic.<br><br>It is also traditional practice for a ship that sees the left side of another ship coming onto its path to give way.<br><br>In the case of the collision between the anti-submarine patrol ship RSS Courageous and container vessel ANL Indonesia, it is not clear which direction the former was travelling in.<br><br>Beyond such legal safeguards, ship captains avoid collisions by being careful, said experienced seamen.<br><br>Mr Gopalakrishnan said that all merchant ships must have identifying lights.<br><br>'But if there's rain, visibility will be poor and it's hard to see the lights,' he said.<br><br>A Mindef spokesman said that besides using radar to spot vessels, they deploy six-man teams which scan the waters for four hours at a stretch.<br><br>These precautions, however, do not guarantee accidents will not occur.<br><br>Mr Robert Karniol, Asia-Pacific bureau chief for leading security journal Jane's Defence Weekly, said the weather, sea conditions, the crew's experience and even the efficiency of the radar systems could be con- tributing variables.<br><br>Captain James Fong, president of the Singapore Nautical Institute, added that the sea may have been choppy because of the north-east monsoon.<br><br>'Vessels are affected by the strong waves and heavy swell.<br><br>'The merchant ship might not have been able to see the navy ship, which could have been bobbing up and down, hidden between two waves,' he said.<br><br>He added that studies have shown that 80 per cent of collisions are the result of human error.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are interested to know, as well as clearing up some misconceptions, the RSS Courageous is built of steel for the hull only, while the superstructure is made of aluminium alloy. This type of construction is quite the norm for naval vessels of this size, or most vessels smaller than frigate size. Only frigates and bigger are built entirely of steel, with the exception of some classes, eg. French Lafayette Class Frigate, where the superstructure is built from composites (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>Another misconception I would like to corrrect is that ships built from steel doen't mean they are armored, simply because the steel plates used are no longer as thick as those used for WW2 era ships. They are at most a couple of inches compared to several inches in WW2 cruisers, and much more for battleships. Even then, cruisers in WW2 that were involved in collisions (or rammed by bigger vessels) had broken into 2 halves let only RSS Courageous.<br><br>One observation that was probably overlooked by members on this board is the effort made by the crew to keep the vessel afloat even though the vessel's buoyancy was compromised to say the least. I think the crew had done tremendously well in damage control to keep the vessel afloat after the aft part was practically sheared off.<br>Kudos should go to them. But questions will have to be answered, the commanders will have to shoulder the blame, period.<br><br>My sympathies to the family of the deceased female crew member.<br></div>
