            <div class='col-md body'>Heavy tanks are not really suitable in Northern and middle Australia, thus you will see ADF only wanted a limited number. 550 million AUD for 59 upgrade second hand M1A1 is not that expensive considering they will be getting the entire package from a re-engine for the gas turbine to a diseal one, some tropicalisation as well as other yet to disclosed items (I hope they get the CCITV as well).<br><br>Snippets from another source also cited:<br><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/09/1078594364315.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/09/1078594364315.html</a><br><blockquote><br>Defence sources said Australia had bought a "complete capability" rather than just a tank.<br><br>The US has agreed to provide continuing maintenance for the tanks, training and simulators, spare parts, support vehicles such as transport trucks and accessories such as radios.<br><br>Unlike the US version, the Australian tanks will not use depleted uranium in its armour.<br><br>The tanks' gas turbine engines will also be compatible with diesel and helicopter fuel used by the Australian Defence Force, rather than the aviation fuel used by the US version.<br></blockquote></div>

And at just under ten million each they're not cheap. But the M1A1 ABRAMS tanks are big and far more powerful than the weapons Australia currently has. The ABRAMS tanks were used widely in the invasion of Iraq last year.<br><br>But despite the tanks' undisputed superiority in that theatre of war, defence experts here in Australia are worried that the Federal Government could get more bang for its defence buck by spending the money elsewhere.<br><br>Nick Grimm reports.<br><br>NICK GRIMM: They might have only been facing the dilapidated military of Saddam Hussein, but when columns of American M1-AI Abrams tanks raced across the deserts of Iraq on their way to Baghdad last year they cast a powerful image around the world of US military might.<br><br>According to Aldo Borgu, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, it was a sight that stopped Australian defence planners in their tracks, and persuaded them that Australia needed that kind of war machine.<br><br>ALDO BORGU: I'd be very surprised if that wasn't the case and certainly, you know, there really doesn't seem to be any other reason other than that.<br><br>NICK GRIMM: The Abrams tanks Australia is to buy are second-hand built eleven years ago but are being re-manufactured with their odometers set back to zero. In theory they should be as good as new.<br><br>Aldo Borgu.<br><br>ALDO BORGU: Certainly, I mean, there's no doubt that we need tanks. I mean, the fact is that basically, I think, in modern warfare demonstrated that infantry need the protection of tanks.<br><br>My question is what sort of relative priority of actually buying the tanks now, when they weren't so much of a priority a few years ago, but also, you know, what are we actually sacrificing in cutting in our infantry battalions to actually fund those tanks?<br><br>NICK GRIMM: Australia is to purchase 59 of the tanks to replace the army's 30-year-old fleet of German-built Leopard tanks, which now lack the heavy armour required to protect soldiers against modern armour-piercing weapons.<br><br>But some experts argue the Abrams, which weigh in at 67 tonnes, are heavy gas guzzlers. On the plus side, though, they're fast, with a top spend of around 70 kilometres an hour, but it has been said that many of the Abrams tanks had their progress stalled during the race to Baghdad when they got too far ahead of supply lines and ran out of fuel.<br><br>So there has been debate about whether Australia would be better buying lighter, more fuel-efficient tanks.<br><br>Yet Aldo Borgu is more concerned about whether the defence budget could be more effectively spent elsewhere.<br><br>ALDO BORGU: Certainly I think the major issue is what are we actually going to be using these tanks for? Now obviously the Government's made its decision based on increased interoperability with the United States, but the concern that I'd have is the primary reason we're getting these tanks is that we're going to be able to more participate in operations like Iraq and Korea outside of our region, and I just don't think that's the real priority we should be looking at.<br><br>NICK GRIMM: In what way would it close down the Australian military's options?<br><br>ALDO BORGU: Well, I think you've got to look at how we're actually funding the acquisition of the tanks. The fact is they weren't in the government's defence plan previously, so something had to give, and the indications are that projects to increase the combat capabilities of our infantry battalions have been cut for some 40 per cent to fund this purchase.<br><br>Now, what that means is the infantry aren't going to have a lot of heavy weapons that they were going to have before, so it makes it more likely that you're going to have to use the tanks to support the infantry.<br><br>TONY EASTLEY: Aldo Borgu is from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. He was speaking there with Nick Grimm.<br><br>This is a transcript from AM. The program is broadcast around Australia at 08:00 on ABC Local Radio</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>G'day back to ya SSGT Kingston, thanks for the insight into the sealift capabilities of the RAN. I paid a visit to Garden Island in 2001 when visiting the USS Kitty Hawk, and saw a couple of RAN ships there. The facilities there are impressive, for a urban naval base!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>yes it is the RSN who has acquired 4 stealthy frigates in the shape of the Formidable class. The bulk of the RSN's sealift needs will be met by 4 Endurance-class LST (in capabilities more like LSDs or LPDs as discussed here). More info on the ships can be found on the following threads:<br><br>Frigates<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=63908<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=62138<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=61711<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=64639<br><br>LSTs<br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=59350<br><br>Sorry for the missing photos in my postings, I've taken them off the server, but if you pop me a private message with your email I can sent them to you.

The SYLVER VLS which contains the missiles comes in two flavors: A43 and A50; and only the latter takes both ASTER 15 and 30. The former only ASTER 15. (See: <a href="http://www.eurosam.com/blocks/sylver.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurosam.com/blocks/sylver.htm</a>)<br><br>2. According to the Japanese edition of JDW (see <a href="http://www.kojii.net/jdw/jdw040211.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kojii.net/jdw/jdw040211.html</a>), the Formidables are equipped with the A43. (You don't have to read much Japanese to see this on the page.)<br><br>So looks like it's going to be the ASTER 15 after all. (Which is such a pity, as the only difference space wise is that the A50 is 0.6m longer than that A43!)<br><br>But one thing's for sure. As Viper52 puts it:<br><br><blockquote><strong>SAMs, Harpoon missiles and ASW helos...it'll be multipurpose.</strong></blockquote>Theory</div>
