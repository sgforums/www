            <div class='col-md body'>This is old news but what does SAF think of this? Turf war coming up? The SAF already has this capabiity (NDU, SOF). Why duplication, isn't that a waste of resources?<br><br>New maritime assault capability to fight terror in Singapore's waters<br>02 February 2005 1540 hrs (SST)<br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/130413/1/.html<br><br>SINGAPORE : The Singapore police has launched a new maritime assault capability aimed at fighting crime and terrorism in Singapore's territorial waters, especially with the high volime of traffic at sea.<br><br>In a possible scenario, a high-speed sea chase with assault boats circle in on a hijacked ferry at the Eastern Anchorage.<br><br>Special Tactics and Rescue or STAR officers then jump onboard to save hostages and arrest the hijackers.<br><br>The STAR officers have been training over the past 4 years to expand their role from land to sea to develop this maritime assault capability aimed at dealing with criminals on the high seas here.<br><br>And the biggest challenge when making the transition was the sea itself.<br><br>The Commanding Officer of the Special Tactics and Rescue (STAR) Unit, Arthur Law said, "Getting used to sea-sickness. a few of our guys didn't adapt operating at sea, we had a few cases where they vomited during the initial phases of our training, but after some time, they got used to it with determination."<br><br>The officers trained with their counterparts in the US, UK and Hong Kong on the various aspects of maritime operations, from assault diving, vessel boarding techniques and close confrontations on vessels, to prepare for any situation.<br><br>"It's not an entirely new role; we have our brothers in the Police Coast Guard and Navy, but the STAR Unit's primary responsibility will be in Singapore's territorial waters. I see this enhanced capability as giving the STAR Unit more confidence in managing any situation - whether dealing with hostages, piracy or terrorist-related." said Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs and Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee.<br><br>This will add yet another level of security to keep the busy sea-lanes safe. - CNA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is good that the Star develop this capabilities.<br><br>Think of times when Singapore have need to deploy its SOF for other missions, and the Star is still available for these type of internal issues.<br><br>Any way this type of hostage situation is more suited for Stars units. SOF then can concentrate on other more military aspect of the roles they can play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Any internal threats should rightfully be handle by police units. Even though special military units can do things like hostage rescue, etc. - their primary missions should be military in nature. In Singapore, its good have more of such units complementing each other, you never know when all of them are needed at that same time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Police and Military do things differently, For example a SWAT might storm in a building and will try to arrest the suspect and only shoot when if the suspect if armed and starts to point his weapon on the officers.Military, in the other hand, will go in violently. the threat will always end up with double taps on their heads like in the Princess Gate Affair, SAS troops shot the men even though put their hands up and the blast all the rounds from their MP5's on one of the terrorist who tried to take out a pistol. Jus t my observation though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the STAR has been in existence for quite some time liao... so it's just a show of their anti- sea terror capabilities... They are different from SAF. SAF forces are for internal and external missions or war while STAR forces only operate here inside singapore. Do note that SAF do take part in events happening within Singapore. Example, the recent Tekong case where the malaysians run there to hide.</div>
