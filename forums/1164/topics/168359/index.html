In a 4 plane flight SEAD run, do we want to carry 2 external fuel tanks, + 1 ALQ 131, together with our HARMs.<br><br>To do that, means, we would only have 2 HARMs, 4 A2A missiles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well like one of the forumnites mentioned, with SAMs these days becoming Electronically scanned, it might only take a brief second to search the sky, and then standby the radar.  Combined with active radar homing SAMs, the good ol HARM's wont be as useful anymore.<br><br>Well, what if your E-2 is down?  You can't build a defensive system or ring all hingeing on 1 crucial component and hope that it wont get taken down.  2ndly, to fire a BVR missile like the AMRAAM, u need to lock on to the target first.  What if you can't lock on due to jamming? I've ever tried going against SU-30MKKs in sims and they have jammers that can't be burnt through until less than 15 miles out.  The F-16's radar ain't powerful enough to burn some of the active jamming these days.  And believe me, getting caught in a knife fight with Su-30s is a Big No-No.<br><br>Jammers reduces BVR capabilities.  Unless we got some AMRAAM C7s that have HOJ, then different story.<br><br>F-16, single engine, small plane.  Su-30mkk big aircraft, 2 engines.  Assuming BOTH fires and off-boresight weapon at each other, the F-16 if surive, would flame out, and pilot have to eject.  Su-30 still have 1 more engine to make it back, IF it survives.<br><br>Like i said, the range advantage is not just the legs, but also the radar's range.  What range the radar is capable of burning through jammers. Big planes tend to have more powerful radars too.</div>

The marines need them to replace the harriers on their LSTs.<br><br>Oh yeah, i went to try out the BVRAAM engagement between Su-30MKKs / Adder vs F-16 / AMRAAMs in the sim.<br><br>Results was a 2:1 kill ratio........ in favor of the flankers. HOHO!<br>2 F-16's splashed for every 1 Su-30mkk. No Jamming.<br><br>The problem was with the length of time it takes for the AMRAAM to go autonomous.  By the time it goes autonomous, the F-16 has barely seconds to try to defeat the incoming Adder.<br><br>The Adder also has (in the sim) a slight range advantage.  AMRAAMs frequently didnt manage to KILL the Su-30s.  Crippled yes, killed no.<br><br></div></blockquote>don't have to wait for the AMRAAM to go pitbull before breaking lock.<br><br>wad sim you playing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed.  Theoretically, the F-16s can fire off the amraams and then break lock to evade the incoming adders.<br><br>The only reason why the kill ratio was 2:1 was that the F-16s waited for the pitbull before turning to evade.  Without it, it could have been worse.</div>
