            <div class='col-md body'>The last occasion when Gurkha Police in Singapore used their weapons in a battle situation was in the seventies. Kidnappers had barricaded themselves at a house in Serangoon. The Police Reserve Unit (SOC) was called to arrest the kidnappers. The kidnappers were given a chance to surrender by a Police Inspector calling out from a loud hailer.Whilst calling from the top of a riot vehicle, the Police inspector was shot dead. At the same time the criminals opened fire with sub-machineguns. Several other Police officers were wounded by automatic fire as well as hand grenades. A firefight ensued with hundreds of rounds fired, but the police were unable to move forward without risk of further casualties.........<br><br>Faced with this failure, the Gurkhas were called in. In the face of automatic gun fire, several stood up in the open to cut the fence using wirecutters, igoring the fire directed at them. When the fence was cut, a party dashed into the house from the front door. The kidnappers were all shot dead. No Gurkha casualties recorded.................real malu for local SPF.......</div>

Well so be it.<br><br>I shall not indulge in quoting something that happened 30 years ago.   The situation had changed and the example is no longer valid.<br><br>How about something that happened recently in Malaysia?   Apparently, Malaysian Police do not even have the ability to go after roadside software and music pirates.   Instead, they have to give guns to anti-piracy thugs to get them to do the job for them!   One of these official government thugs was so frightened during action that he fired his weapon and hitting an innocent man eating in a coffee shop!<br><br>Malu lah!!!<br><br>Oh incidentally, maybe the police were too busy to do enforcement tasks - too busy stop motorists and collecting fines which end up in their own pockets!<br><br>Lagi malu!!!</div>

But I am also aware that just after that incident in '74,  our govt realised that we had no proper response, except for the Police tactical unit and the Gurkhas and some commandos. Post '74,  we made the effort to build up the seeds of today's SOF, and also today's Police STAR unit.<br><br>By the early -80s we had enough chaps trained , and I think we were reasonably mature.<br></div>
