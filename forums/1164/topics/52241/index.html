            <div class='col-md body'>Just because the RSM has the use of the CO's car, when the CO is not using it, does not mean that the RSM is of higher rank than the OC, PC.<br><br>The RSM is the most senior of NON-COMMMISSIONED OFFICER (NCO), while the rank from 2LT upwards are all COMMISSIONED Officers.<br><br>After the Battalion CO, the next person in seniority rank, is the Battalion 2 I/C, then S-1, S2, S3 and the next higher authority to take over command, when Battalion HQ is wiped out, will be the most senior Company OC.<br><br>In the SAF, it is NOT uncommon for the RSM or CSM to be older in age than a junior officer of 2LT rank, or even a younger LT or CPT, or even a Major or Major General.<br><br>The experience of the RSM and CSM is limited only to his scope and area of responsibilities, and perhaps his knowledge in how to get things done in the SAF.<br><br>It is the job of the RSM and CSM (and all other NCOs) to give support to the Officers - in managing the SAF, and getting the job done. There should be no rivalries between the Commissioned Officer Rank and the NON-Commissioned Officer Rank.<br><br>Let us not imagine that such rivalries exist, and even if there is such a rivalry, it is due to the immaturity of the parties concerned.<br><br></div>
