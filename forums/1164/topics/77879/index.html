Unless you become untraceable.<br><br>Sometimes unit will recall some back for a small low-key stuff which does not involve the whole NS unit. This may explain your current situation.

            <div class='col-md body'>As have been mentioned by the other members here, they will mail the SAF100 to you, then if you don't respond by x number of days, they will send it via registered mail, and if you still don't respond by x number of days, they will personally deliver one. So unless you did not notify MINDEF of an address change, or become untraceable, its <strong>quite</strong> unlikely that an SAF100 will not reach you.<br><br>At my last ICT, my S1 was not too pleased that a large number of us did not respond to the first SAF 100, and most only reposnded after the registered mail and some only after the unit had to send a personal courier!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
