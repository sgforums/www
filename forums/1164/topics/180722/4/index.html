If fighting in BUA we can use more agile light tanks.<br><br>as i forumer noted, new systems take time to train crews takes time to get operational and also becuz our env is mostly BUA in war time is a good idea to keep some reserve tanks back home to guard the lion's balls so this way our resources is not stretched.</div>

No armour, no arty, etc.  And I can only imagine their navy is more like a coast guard.  Definitely no air force.  Its gonna take some time.

So as long as Susilo &amp; gang don't have plans of invading Timor Leste, I don't see why they should be too worried about Timor having a handful of FIFTY year old tanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i think we should assist Timor Leste as much as possible in terms of setting up their military etc.  We can always do it under a pretext of training their troops to be more effective in counter-insurgency, for a more stable reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not so simple in the case of Timor Leste. Firstly, they just separate from Indonesia not too long ago and sending arms and helping them militarily can have the negative impact of Indonesia seeing us as helping a potential adversary. Let me explain, I am sure many in the Indonesian government are still bitter over the lost of East Timor. After all, many Indonesian soldiers lives have been lost while annexing and occupying it for so long. They fought against the rebels led by Xanana Gusmao for many years. Many members of the governemnt are also ex military personnel and now they have to see Gusmao a former guerilla leader as a president who meet their own president on the same level as head of states. The lost of East Timor is a terrible blow to their national pride.<br><br>Secondly, Timor Leste is currently firmly in the sphere of infuence of Australia since they are the main force who help 'liberate' East Timor.Australia is eager to have a share (some will say by bullying) of the undersea gas fields in the Timor Sea. It will be a politically delicate move should Singapore choose to help Timor Leste.<br><br>I think it will be a better idea to sell the older SM1s to Philippines at friendship prices or donate them as they have been combating the Communist and Muslim terrorists for many years without obvious success. We can keep the newer and less worn out ones as reserves.</div>
