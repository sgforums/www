            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tankee1981:</div><div class="quote_body">Its not so simple in the case of Timor Leste. Firstly, they just separate from Indonesia not too long ago and sending arms and helping them militarily can have the negative impact of Indonesia seeing us as helping a potential adversary. Let me explain, I am sure many in the Indonesian government are still bitter over the lost of East Timor. After all, many Indonesian soldiers lives have been lost while annexing and occupying it for so long. They fought against the rebels led by Xanana Gusmao for many years. Many members of the governemnt are also ex military personnel and now they have to see Gusmao a former guerilla leader as a president who meet their own president on the same level as head of states. The lost of East Timor is a terrible blow to their national pride.<br><br>Secondly, Timor Leste is currently firmly in the sphere of infuence of Australia since they are the main force who help 'liberate' East Timor.Australia is eager to have a share (some will say by bullying) of the undersea gas fields in the Timor Sea. It will be a politically delicate move should Singapore choose to help Timor Leste.<br><br>I think it will be a better idea to sell the older SM1s to Philippines at friendship prices or donate them as they have been combating the Communist and Muslim terrorists for many years without obvious success. We can keep the newer and less worn out ones as reserves.</div></blockquote>That's the best thing anyone's said about this "supplying tanks to Timor" business.<br><br>Timor is gonna be another banana republic that's gonna see a lot more internal strife in the years to come and getting involved is definitely not a good idea unless you are prepared to wade in and pull them out of trouble all the time. You supply arms to one government today and you don't know if they'll still be in charge tomorrow.<br><br>And most importantly true is that it is really NOT our area of influence. The Aussies are more than capable of taking care of their own backyard.<br><br>Giving the AMX-13 to Philippines is a dam good idea. Trade it for 10 year's supply of canned pineapples or something for SAF combat ration!!! It's a case of exchanging one tin can for another. And if it helps Philippines send a few Al-Quedas to heaven, all the better.</div>
