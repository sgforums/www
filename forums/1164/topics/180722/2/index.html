            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by gary1910:<br><strong><br><br>Most countries in the world are still using so called "old tank", for example IDF just recently retired their own Centurion and still have many M60( upgraded of course) in svc.</strong></blockquote><br><br>(First of all, you are the acknowledged tank expert here, so I am just offering some unsubstantiated opinions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>The IDF had retired their Centurions from the MBT role, not just recently - but for nearly three decades. During the war in Lebanon in <strong>1982</strong>, IDF converted their already <strong>obsolescent</strong> Centurion MBTs to specialised roles and a heavily-armoured APC version called Nagmashot.<br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/engineer_vehicles/nagmashot/nagmashot5.jpg"><br><br>The IDF AMX-13 was made obsolete even earlier - despite being upgraded to 90mm gun. (With a 105mm upgrade also available.) Why? because they were unreliable, had thin armour that even a .5 HMG could penetrate. And as a result suffered very heavy casualties and did not fit with IDF's emphasis on crew survivability - which is the prime objective of all Merkava designs.<br><br><blockquote><br><br>The most modern tanks in SEA other than what SAF have is the PT-91 which is a actually an upgraded T-72M1( 30 y.o. tanks), so any old tank with proper upgraded FCS, armour, powerpack etc , a old hull could still performed, that is why there are still so many "old tank"around in most armies.</blockquote>First of all, not all the PT-91 Twardy are old tanks that has gone through factory rebuilding. Some are brand new tanks. I don't know if Malaysia got the rebuilds or brand new tanks, though. And apparently, on the new tanks, the armour protection is very impressive.<br><br>The T-72 was an impressive success to begin with. So you can still upgrade it and it'll function for a couple more decades. But the AMX-13 was a disastrous failure right from the start. Nearly every country that operated it quickly phased it out like Israel and India.<br><br>The AMX-13 is not a platform worth any further refurbishment or modernisation. How much further can you go with such a unconventional and strange design? You can't even fit a gun stabilisation thing to the strange turret design which means you have to stop, take aim, and then shoot. It'll be like WW2 all over again.<br><br><blockquote><br>Having a new tank in any armed forces is no easy task especially a large qty, let's say qty of 300 tanks, the army will need to train at least 300 set of crews, large group of maintenance specialists, instructors, logistics etc.<br><br>Then there is cost incurred above plus the actual cost of modern tank, a light tank today could easily cost at least USD2mil, if it's include modern FCS with TI, BMS , composite armour, APS etc, it could be as high as USD3~5mils!!!!<br><br>Therefore it is very large investment and it is not simple decision to make especially when it will be used for at least 2~3 decades.</blockquote>But isn't that true of any weapons procurement? But that hasn't stopped SAF (or anybody) from buying new equipment. These include submarines, stealth frigates, LSV, UAV, Primus, SAR-21... etc.<br><br>Don't talk of money cos if you look at SAF procurement - it appears we have very deep pockets.<br><br>Why go out and buy F-16, F-15 and phase out A-4 and F-5? Are the A-4 and F-5 not able to fly? Anyone got problem with M-16? No, but still we now got a schmancy new SAR-21.<br><br>For some reason, SAF feels constant progress is necessary in all arms - except MBT. The buck stopped there. And we operate museum pieces that are as old as their crew's grandparents.<br><br>We are supposed to be operating well over 300 tanks if you count both the AMX-13 and Tempest published figures. So we must have at least 300 sets of well-trained crews at any one time. So getting them trained on another vehicle is a matter of time.<br><br><blockquote>Lastly, there is this notion that some believe that tanks are obsolete becos of modern land based ATGM, precision ATGM from attack helos and fighters etc, some army are actually moving away from having any tanks and instead using low cost wheeled fire support AFV etc.<br><br>That is becos it was well demontrated in GW1, where most of the Iraqi armour were actually decimated by fighters and attack helo, way b4 the actual ground war started.<br><br>For example the Apaches itself destroyed 800 vehicles including 500 AFVs!!!<br><br>One thing tank for fire support role, tank is still needed, but for tank vs tank senario, is it still neccessary????</blockquote>Turn on the TV and you see news footage of Iraq. In the background there is usually a big M1 MBT parked somewhere. Someone forgot to tell the Americans and the Iraqis that heavily-armoured MBTs are obsolete. Light wheeled vehicles like Stryker and Hummer are being massacred by RPGs and homemade bombs.<br><br>(Israel, with all her tank experience in urban and non-urban situations, is still going for tracks, heavy armour and tank cannons.)<br><br>Iraqi convoys got massacred cos they had no air cover.<br><br>Why is it that because an MBT can be destroyed by aircraft, it means an MBT is obsolete?<br><br>Nearly everything can be destroyed by enemy aircraft without air cover, including jeeps, trucks, radar, ships, helos, soldiers. Does that make all those things obsolete?<br><br><blockquote>I dunno, becos with longer range ATGM as compare with tanks, attack helo etc, it could still decimated a large armoured force, that is why the SAF Gen was saying last year that SAF might be looking having a light tank replacement using missile only, instead of a tank gun!!![/b]</blockquote>Well, look at the undisputed leader of armour - Israel. I don't see them replacing their 120mm guns with missiles.<br><br>The US had a tank in the 70's called the M551 Sheridan. It had a 152mm little tube that fires missiles and conventional rounds. The missile tank concept never quite took off and today, the US continues to use cannons.<br><br>The argument was that a tank cannon is still faster, cheaper and more versatile than a missile.<br><br>I don't know in detail what the SAF general said. But vehicles - not necessarily a tank - mounted with ATGWs already exist in the SAF inventory including LSV. If you can mount a TOW missile on a bicycle, it'll also be able to kill a tank. So you don't need to waste a tank by arming it with only missiles.<br><br>The tank, with its armour protection, is to provide a <strong>punch</strong> (SAF Mailed Fist emblem) for ground troops and also to destroy enemy tanks when encountered. But if your tank is armed only with missiles, what does it do when it encounters a fortified objective? Fire an ATGM?<br><br>And in the process, it must also lend itself to be invulnerable to enemy fire as much as possible. So it needs heavy armour. Just because ATGM can destroy a modern tank doesn't make the tank obsolete. Cos enemy troops aren't always armed with ATGMs as if these things are common currency. What's common however, are infantry rocket-launchers like RPGs or RR like our 84mm. Any tank we get must be able to withstand attacks from these weapons. Otherwise it is about as useful as a pickup truck.<br><br>And if enemy aircraft shows up the right thing to do is to make sure of our own air cover. And all armour must righlfully have its own air defence elements like V-200 with RBS-70 etc.<br><br>Just because aircrafts can destroy tanks doesn't mean we don't need tanks anymore.  One system doesn't make another system obsolete - it just compliments each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a very old tankee, I believe sooner or later the AMX13 will be replace by another light tank (maybe BX with 105 or 120 main gun or with missile as well if they can fit that in). Just wait patiently.<br><br>If i guess correctly, SM1 is never intend to go aginst any MBT or PT91 but to serve as support fire against APC or light vehicles.  You must be mad if you sent SM1 with such light armour to punch through enemy front line.<br><br>Our rumoured Centurions should be the one to go against any MBT. But even with any extensive upgrade or ERA(like the IDF ), our old Centurions will still be sitting ducks against current generation of Anti-tank weapon like Spike with Tandem (Double) Warhead which allows for increased penetration, especially against reactive armor, and enables the second warhead to penetrate the target. There are others missiles with such warhead around in our neighbouring countries.<br><br>SAF should ready look into newer MBT or upgrades(whole turret) with active defence system (think not mature yet and expensive) inorder for us to have a counter against PT91 if SAF have not already done so. (It will be a secret we never know like the Centurions after 30 over years and still not seen in Singapore)<br><br>We will still need a tank(MBT) to go against PT91 and can also survive in today's anti tank missile environment.  Do not rely only on Apache or airforce to do the job as tanks are still needed to punch through any defence and secured ground with infantry like our armour logo (Armoured Fist)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Im not sure whether the same deadly flaw of the original T-72's design is still on the PT-91M. According to one tank analyst expert on a recent Discovery Channel Programme(The Greatest Ever), i remember clearly that he says the one thing he doesn't like about the T-72 is that its main gun ammo are not stored within its armoured structure.  As a result, it was ranked 7th out of 10.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah.... back to the same old topic on why we havent replace the SM-1.<br><br>I suspect they would be looking at a light armored vehicle capable of supporting the AI, rather than a "light tank."  Tracked vehicles that have the punching power to blow holes in walls for infantry to breach.  Vehicles that suit both urban and jungle/tropical terrain.<br><br>I think its quite natural for them to be slow and picky about such a huge replacement quantity.<br><br>Currently, the best way to kill a tank is with TOP-attack munitions. And if we can mount spike launchers on this new light tank, why not?  An APFSDS isn't necessarily the silver bullet that would kill tanks.<br><br>There isn't much room to operate MBTs in our region.

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that our SM1s are old platforms in even older bodies.<br><br>However i personally feel that it is our policy to actually go using IFVs.  If you guys have seen the ARMY adverts on TV you would realised that the Armour part is showing the main Punch using the Bionix and mainly those with the cannon....the SM1s are .....lets just say not part of the picture.  So it is likely that we field IFV based vehicles as the main force. This is taking into the fact that IFVs we have are slightly quicker than the SM1. Thus, SM1s can be considered as fire-support.<br><br>I belief we are going to have a modern tank that is of higher survivability and capablilities.  It is just that while we are in this gap...at least we have tank crews that are semi trained on a main-gun platform rather than none at all... It will be easier for the crew to adapt/upgrade to a new platform than to only start tank-crew training with the new tanks that may pop out only in the future.</div>

On the coastal road, Merkava Mk. 1 tanks led the forces from Rosh Hanikra, through the dense RPG and SAGGER armed PLO positions on the coastal road, north to Sidon , Damur, and Beirut . Clashing with anti-tank weapons at a distance of only a few meters during roadside ambushes, the tanks suffered many hits, with little effect on their performance. Some partially penetrated the armour protection but could not harm the crew. The casualties suffered by the Merkava Mk. 1 crews in this area were also shrapnel and small arms fire, inflicted outside the tanks."<br><br>Why didn't the Israelis use something lighter, smaller and more manueverable in the FIBUA nightmare of Beirut? They definitely didn't lack choices as they have a very large choice of armour platforms to choose from.<br><br>In fact, they needed the power and armour protection of MBT so much that they converted Centurions and captured T-55 hulls into APC.<br><br>Compared to Beirut, Singapore is a heaven for MBT with good wide roads and highways everywhere. No room for MBT? Don't kid yourself. Just make sure the MBTs that show up on our roads are ours and not someone else's. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>This is like the British saying during WW2 that tanks cannot operate in this part of the world<br><br>Everyone is saying that a chopper can destroy a MBT.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, with the great investment in our Air Force and Navy, I suppose we are opting for a "shock &amp; awe" tactic where we scare and stun the living s*hit outta our foes. Bomb them like hell before sending in boots to flush them out and occupy. And this results in some people feeling we have no room for MBTs.<br><br>However, it must be understood that SAF may not be operating MBTs at the moment due to the fact that their aim is to race forward and towards the enemy in highly mobile vehicles which move so fast that it actually surprises and overwhelm's the foes ability to react and thus limiting the usefulness of MBTs. However, personally I still feel that the SAF should operate MBTs, the Leopard,Merkavas would be good choices given their crew survivalibility and speed.  Though it would have been easier to take out MBTs with Aircrafts/Choppers, this is not a major factor, as having MBTs and having a heli-borne force which can take out armour is actually complementary to each other. They are meant to work with each other for the greater good.<br><br>Just my 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But it is the units like the Strykers along with their accompanying AI thats dashing down the streets in pursuit of insurgents, NOT the mighty M1A2s.  The M1A2s stand outside the urban limits and only move in to provide fire support, OF COURSE they take less casualties lar.
