            <div class='col-md body'>Its kinda ironic that we have replaced our 20 year old A4 and are even talking about replacing the F-16 when there we have the AMX-13 (first produced in 1953) which is a bloody old 53 yr old grandfather.<br><br>Yes its been upgraded to SM1 standard but so what?  All that adds is a better engine, transmission, running gear and electrical system.  No improvement to armour or firepower.  And honestly, how much can you improve a 53 year old platform?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know there are many rumours flying around.  One was that the former COA supposedly said the SM1 replacement may not be another tank but could be a rocket launched platform.  Another rumour is that ST Kinetics will be building a tank based on the Bionix chassis.  Yet another rumour claims that we'll probably buy ST Kinetic's Terrex and fit it with a 90mm main gun.<br><br>Personally I think a mixture of MBT &amp; light tanks would be good.  Perhaps the Merkeva 4 or LeClerc combined with the Terrex 90mm vehicle?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terrex is a wheeled vehicle and it is design for urban, peacekeeping or rapid deployment (in a c-130) operation.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>SAF light tank replacement will definitely be a tracked vehicle.<br><br>He needs to keep up with the tracked bionix, bronco, m-113, primus etc<br><br>a wheeled vehicle tactical mobility can never be as good as a tracked vehicle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Therefore a 90mm gun terrex as SAF light tank replacement is definitely a no no.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am really getting very frustrated over this matter! They seem to me to be dragging their feet on this, even the NGF is finally decided but not the SM1 replacement. I am really concerned about this because even though i know that the SM1 tanks we use in war is not what is announced in public, they are still very old! Many tankee's lives are at stake here! I just hope they are using all this time to do a good job!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I am also dying to see what new tanks we can get - it is a fact that it is a very low priority item in terms of national security.<br><br>First line of defense remains air and sea and in there we have spared no effort or money and we have definitely the finest air and naval forces this part of the world. This will ensure that any one coming over will suffer great manpower and material losses before they reach our soil. And most armies in this region do not have the capacity to absorb that kind of destruction.<br><br>However, if a tank on tank occasion does occur, even our 105mm Centurion will be of no match for a modern PT-91. So gone case.<br><br>But, continued good relations with our neighbours mean we are not going to war next week. So no need to hurry.<br><br>I am continually puzzled by our ultra-modern SAF still operating two 60-year old vehicles: Centurion and AMX-13 and I do look forward to SAF getting something NEW at least "for show" at National Day Parades. These grandfather tanks are a bit of an embarassment - though I must say the AMX-13 is rather cute with that very "retro" look. Makes me think of a Citroen 2CV.<br><br>One of the most modern army in the world but with the most obsolete tank force. Surely this can not go on. I'm sure Bangladesh or Congo got better tanks than we do.

Using tanks to kill another tank is very expensive and silly. Tanks can be killed in many other less risky ways, such as using ATGMs.  Tanks are probably relevant today only in an armored infantry role.</div>
