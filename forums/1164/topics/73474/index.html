            <div class='col-md body'>Just a few things, Gary.  I don't think you have to be a regular when you sign up for selection - the guys from CDO I knew who went for selection were NSF when they did it.  Also, once you're posted to SOF, you stay there except when you're rotated through your tours of duty, typically in 1 CDO (e.g. a CSM tour if you're a specialist, or an OC tour if you're an officer).<br><br>As for the training, I was from 1 CDO, but some of my company mates went over to force line, so I know a fair number of the guys there.  They don't talk much about the training, and I don't ask.  What I do know is that it's not so much a question of what you do, but what the selection panel sees of how you do it.</div>

You will have to be serving in the SAF for a year at least (if I remembered), PES A with perfect eyesight. Usually - they will come around with a list of names - to invite individuals to try out for selection. People from different units can try the selection - but most will come from combat units.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nathan - when you say that you wouldn't want to meet somebody in a dark alley, you mean that the person is scary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There's one particular guy from my platoon who's now a Ranger cadre and also an instructor in PTW.  Back when we were serving together, he was a really nice guy, kind of goofy, really.  I actually caught up with him a few weeks ago, after not having seen him for about 11 years, and he's still the same.  Later, my friend's cousin from to 2001 batch said that this guy was a real saidst and I said, "What?  He's the nicest guy on the planet!", but I later checked up with the other guys from my company, and they told me that when the drowning incident happened, everybody breathed a sigh of relief that this guy was out of town at the time - he would have been the first to be blamed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
