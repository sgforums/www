              <p>Hmmm? Your deferment appeal was turned down? You're only 17, and in ITE.... as long as you can prove that you're in ITE, there's no reason why it should be turned down.</p>
              <p>Did you ask your school for a deferment letter and submitted it to MINDEF?</p>

              <p>Just go down to your school's administrative office and ask for a deferment letter.</p>

              <p>U can try email them highlighting that ur enlistment will be in 2012 and ask if they still want U to keep to the medical checkup date....from what I understand during my time...there are people who went for checkup in poly year 2 and enlisted at the end of poly year 3....meaning 1 to 2 years of difference.</p>
              <p>If they still want U to go for the medical....just go lor...as long as U have the letter saying that U are deferred till 2012...there should be no issue.</p>
