            <div class='col-md body'>Thinking down the wrong path dude, I envision future wars to be fought with information technology more so then ever, and the advent of hypersonic smart weapons will render most long range ballistic weapons useless, safe for at least the direct fire last resort EM weapons.<br><br>Laser weapons are just too inefficent, in terms of modern technology, and almost all other weapon systems can provide more firepower at less energy used. Beam weapons in the near future (if they ever figured out the power supply problem) would probably consist of particle beam weapons that throw out streams of atomic particles at near the speed of light that would distrupt the aubatomic structure of the target when hit, not unlike the star trek phaser.

            <div class='col-md body'>It would if it travelled at the speed of light as "somebody" suggested. Supersonic is nothing next to superluminal. After all, what's 360m/s besides 250,000,000m/s?<br><br>There are several problems with going at or near light speed:<br><br>Firstly, getting to that speed. You can't acceletrate to 250,000km/s in any meaningful amount of time, for the accelerational forces will quickly turn you to mushroom soup. Even at an uncomfortable acceleration of 30/s2 or 3gs, it would take you three months to get to near light speed.<br><br>Secondly, you can't really steer at that speed, your path would be pretty much a straight line, and since you are travelling way beyond the escape velocity of the earth, you would shoot off in a straight line into space (and reach the moon in a second) rather then follow the map of the earth.<br><br>Thirdly, there are releativistic time dilation effects to worry about. (study special relativity)<br><br>Fourthly, if you studied energy mass conversion, you would realize that you cannot exceed the speed of light. Even getting up to near that speed would require an exponential increase to infinity in energy required when approaching lightspeed. Short of something like warp drive, that would mean a complete revolution in modern physics, you could spend all the energy expended by the human race on a single hovertank to little purpose.<br><br>Fifth, all the projectiles you fire would still travel below the speed of light, irregardless of even if you are at lightspeed. (why? study relativity again!)<br><br>All in all, even if we did come up with things like deflector systems and mass dampers, and even warp drive, there is no meaningful reason why any land unit should be anywhere near luminial, or superluminal speeds.<br><br>And of course, from what you can see, ideas of lightspeed hovercraft are firmly entrenched in sci-fi, which unfortunately, is not really science, and useless when we want to predict future scientific trends, for they are just imaginings. When we predict the future of war, we go by things we already understand, not pull something out of the air and say this must be the way.<br><br>To this effect, there are working ideas for particle beam weapons, EM guns, hypersonic smart missiles or even ballistic projectiles. But non so far for speed of light hovercraft firing laser projectiles (by the way, lasers are hardly projectiles), and hardly even any scientific basis for them.

Unless you have specific strength figures for the Bionix hull, I suggest you not yelp too much about crew being affected by shockwaves and fractures and cracks. Which are pretty moot points anyway, if ST wanted to put a 120mm on a Bionix, they would engineer it to be albe to do so.<br><br>The main grouse with putting a 120mm on a Bionix is that it is in itself a pretty inefficent endevour. What we would get is a "tank" that has a lot of unnecessory height and space wasted on its troop carrying abilities that are going to be moot in this new unit. What we would get is a "light tank" that is overly tall and armoured like a IFV. A completely new, lower hull could put the space into better use, and mount more armor protection and powerpack to boot. I suppose ST could engineer Bionix hulls in light tank variants though...  </div></blockquote>Hey brother, you do have to understand where I am coming from. The Swedish CV90-120T had a chassis structure issues during the trial. The recoil force create by the 120mm gun was causing the CV90 chassis to crack. I am sure this can be fixed.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that it is always pointless to simply create an fire-support Bionix version with a 120mm gun because we would see a repeat of such issues with the Bionix chassis. Furthermore, there are so many IFV turns Fire support vehicles. So point about me being "ignorant" is unjustified. Just look at the Spanish ASCORD, Italian Dardo and many other IFVs turn fire-support vehicle cum light tanks, they are all armed with 105mm gun and NOT 120mm guns. Thus, being my point. If we want a Bionix light tank variant, I reckon 105mm gun is the way to go.<br><br>A totally redesign chassis to cater for the 120mm gun is thus NOT Bionix at all. They might share some common design and components such as the engines, suspension, etc - so what - still NOT a Bionix !!!!<br><br>Furthermore, if I think ST Engg/SAF is keen to have a "Bionix light tank", then they should consider the redesign chassis that was developed for the US Interim Armoured Vehicle competition.<br><br>Thus, in reply to your question, I do know what I am talking about and this discussion about arming Bionix with the 120mm gun has been discussed in previous threads too.<br><br>Sorry, just too tempted to refute your points about my previous post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

There are a lot more than that. If ST Engineers are so good, Singapore would be a major MBT or light tank producer. Furthermore, ST Engg also lack experience in designing tanks. The best it did, and darn well too I say, was to copy and modify existing designs. Given the limited manpower and relatively young technology company, I think ST is doing pretty well.<br><br>As for your comments, I have to say it just show how young you are . Sorry, perhaps you need a couple more years of real working experience before you shoot off your comments. Perhaps you should also read more - especially foreign reports and news articles.

Hence the laser is more akin to a light projected blowtorch then a raygun of si fi lore. The closest thing we have in conception today is prehaps the some of the proposed american Star Wars system. <a href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1984/jul-aug/roberds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1984/jul-aug/roberds.html </a><br><br>If rayguns were to become reality, it would require quite a fundemental leap in our understanding of quatum physics. We would have to be able to know a lot more on which kind of subatomic particles to use, how to generate them, project them, and so on and so forth. Assuming there are such short lived subatomic particles, which we'll call rapid nadons which can distrupt the interatomic bonds of the target material on contact. Which is quite different from the thermal effect described by a laser, which is simply concentrating thermal energy into a single spot. If anything, touting the laser as the raygun fufilled is uncreative.<br><br>Nuff said.  [/url]</div>
