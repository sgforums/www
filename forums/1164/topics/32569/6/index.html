            <div class='col-md body'>I'm for the M1A2 as being the best tank about... The Leopard 2 does not quite cut it... they only look similar on paper but the M1A2's IVIS ability allows it far greater coordination and SA then any other current tank (M1A2s can be intergrated with the force 21 systems), including the Leopard 2.<br><br>Armour is superior as well, besides the Chobhamm, the M1A2 has the extra DU layer that gives it the best protection armour wise, though for survivability in event of penetration, the Isreali Merc is far ahead of any western tank.<br><br>It seems that the main reason people pick the Leopard over the Abrams is because they look similar on paper, but the Abrams has the turbine engine. Said and done, the turbine engine is no less then an ordinary one and is in fact the most fuel efficent engine when going full out (though it burns almost as much fuel while idle). The use of the turbine was selected on basis of understanding the advantages (greater realibility, less weight, maintainence ease) and the limits (fuel consumption).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, Mercava MK4 has best crew survability, not armor protection. It is considerably less well armored then some western tanks but it's crew protection and system redundancy is far better, so while it's easier to penetrate and damage or disable, it's harder to knock out the crew. The Merc is a special case, in which the designers did not follow the tank "triange" of speed, firepower and protection, but rather designed in crew protection as a new aspect seperate from actual tank protection. A tank "square" was the term the main designer behind the Merc said.<br><br>In terms of more conventional tanks though. The Abrams armour is certainly heavier then the Challanger 2, the clumsly Challanger 2 lacks the DU package that enhances the protection of the Chobhamm. Mobility of the Abrams is top notch, second only to Leopard, marginally... However it's the technology that makes it argubably, if placed in the hands of a competent tank crew, the deadilest tank around. Tank crews of similar skill are going to be more effective in an Abrams then if they were mucking around in a Leopard or Challanger, which electronically, is pretty much dumb and deaf and chaotic next to the IVIS Abrams.<br><br></div>

Singapore did not announce any purchase of the Sabra2 nor any well known military analyst like Janes release any news about Singapore purchasing any MBT.  The only rumour that has anything to do with secondhand M60s (and AMX-30s) was more than 10 years ago (I have a copy of the Military Technology stating this as well) when SAF was looking at replacing the Centurions for the 32nd Div.  However, this rumour simply faded away and nothing was heard of it.<br><br>If Singapore had indeed purchase M60 derivatives (albeit Israeli modified Sabra version), it will be the first time I've heard of it. In other threads, there are discussion about SAF purchases of Merkava. I think unless we can see proof, eg. 'leak' reports or official announcement from SAF, everything is just speculation and hear-says. Furthermore, all these inaccurrate info are everywhere. Even Straits Times can make mistakes about RSAF with 5 F5 sqn, what can we say about other reports or websites ???? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I don't think I read anything about Sg having M60 in the book. Will check again. The Centurions were in fact upgraded with Israeli stuffs including the 105mm gun, the Commander's cupola, add-on armour, fire-control system, etc.<br><br></div>
