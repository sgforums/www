            <div class='col-md body'>Yes folks you want evidence we give you evidence !!!<br><br>SBSK is indeed Johnston.<br><br>Evidence don't lies !<br><br>I began to sepect that SBSK was just another ID used by someone pretending to be some idiot from the start.<br><br>SBSK already hint time and again he have another id here. So by nature he would us a ID will act the opposite of SBSK. Guess who was the 1st one and keep calling to call for looking for SBSK IP ! Johnston - crying wolf !<br><br>But SBSK have fault in his character, why SBSK in the 1st place ? To bring attention to himself when all other is about to give him a rest. He will use the other ID to play opposite so as to get more attention to himself. So we start to notice that Johnston is the one, also the way and the style is the same as SBSK.  That is the 1st give away ! We began to Zoom in.<br><br>I decide to bring the heat up so to force SBSK to talk cock more and make more mistake. The heat is purely me and SBSK, which johnston is not involved. Suddenly within less then 3 hr posting from johnston on SBSK ? Why ..... "How to deal with smart people like SBSK"  . "Explantary PM by SBSK " , " ..... Mr SBSK " .  That is because the main purpose is attention !!! SBSK need the attention, he use Johnston to open 3 new posting within 2 hr gap !!! But than he make a deadly mistake ! SBSK pride in himself !  Even as in Johnston ID he have pride in SBSK, so he use "smart" and "mr" !!! Look everyone would have put dumb ! instead of smart .So in creating the new posting to promote himself, he still cannot put down his pride and must praise himself SBSK as smart.<br><br>Next we look at the posting time, we notice that everytime Johnston post SBSK will soon follow, also the other way around. Suddenly like both on-line and off-line rather the same time.  Ha ha note just before my this posting, SBSK and johnston suddenly appear together as we see time and again !!! Even this time look folks !!! see with your eyes !!!<br><br>Final we zoom in on their posting. People unconsiously have a habit of using words, captialization and , .  with certain space without...... It is like handwriting, no 2 person is the same. Check out the posting in "Explanatory PM by SBSK" Look at how Johnston and SBSK did their  "," unusual both have space before each "," ! Both like to use Damn ..... look at the captialization of words  terms .<br><br>After that go to see other posting, you will see suddenly both that "," suddenly change to without space in front ... How would 2 separate person suddenly agree to change their style of punctation together !!<br><br>Evidence don't lies !<br><br>I put out message to Johnston, that maybe SBSK have sneak into his house to use his notebook and that why their IP is the same. I put a total of 3 direct posting to Johnston, that you know, SBSK may just be him. Guess what ! suddenly Johnston ignore the posting and SBSK began to take a low profile.<br><br>Ha ha the moment we talk about you both and suddenly two appear out of nowhere together again, posting back to back .....</div>
