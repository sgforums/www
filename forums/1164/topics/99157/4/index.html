Both like to use Damn ..... look at the captialization of words terms . And why after a while both you all suddenly switch togehter on "," suddenly change to without space in front ... How would 2 separate person suddenly agree to change their style of punctation together !!<br><br>Thank you, please kindly explain to everyone on what meander and me requested.
