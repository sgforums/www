            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously I hope they can finally decide on the plane real soon. For those who have followed this news closely since day 1 such as me have been waiting for quite a few years already.In fact, we already have countless topics on this subject in military nuts And I am quite sure i am not the only military nut getting anxious and even impatient on this. Can anyone offer any explanations to why they are taking so long? I mean the naval helicopter seems to have started later(at least from the official media), had already being decided upon. Is it true that fighter planes are harder to evaluate? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
