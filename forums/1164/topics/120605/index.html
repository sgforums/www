There's a lot of activity," one source said.<br><br>A defence ministry spokeswoman said the deal was still being evaluated. She did not give a time frame for an announcement.<br><br>The Eurofighter consortium, Boeing Co. of the United States and French aircraft and defence group Dassault Aviation are vying for the contract.<br><br>Singapore, which spends more on defence than any Southeast Asian nation relative to the size of its economy, is known as a sophisticated arms buyer and its choice of jet could influence others countries considering new fighters.<br><br>One source at a supplier said Singapore was a tough client and that "it's one of the hardest campaigns we have worked on".<br><br>PITCHING HARD<br><br>The Eurofighter consortium includes BAe Systems, Airbus parent EADS and Italy's Finmeccanica. Britain lent support for the bid last year by sending two of its Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Singapore for evaluation.<br><br>French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie urged Singapore's leaders to pick Dassault's Rafale fighter plane during a visit to Singapore this week, echoing comments made by President Jacques Chirac during an October visit.<br><br>The Rafale has yet to win its first export order after Dassault lost out on orders from Norway, the Netherlands and South Korea.<br><br>Singapore has also tested the F-15 fighter jets built by Boeing, which is under pressure to win a deal that would help it extend F-15 production beyond 2008.<br><br>All three of those multi-mission aircraft are much larger and more effective than the old Skyhawks, which are considered good, light bombers but are not fighters at all.<br><br>Singapore is armed to the teeth relative to its size of just 697 square km (436 square miles) and sees its modern weaponry, which includes submarines, stealth frigates and combat jets, as a necessary protection against all sorts of perceived threats.<br><br>At nearly a third of its US$18.3 billion budget, or 5 percent of its US$110 billion economy, Singapore's defence spending is also higher in relative terms than that of military superpowers such as the United States, Britain and France when compared to total government spending.<br><br>The tightly-controlled, predominantly ethnic Chinese city-state of 4.2 million people, is on the doorstep of mostly Muslim neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia and believes it is a prime target for regional group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a network linked to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda.<br><br>Last month, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled plans to spend S$9.26 billion ($5.7 billion) on defence in Singapore's current budget, up 7.4 percent from 2004.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Delayed till quarter 2, mebbe texan sheriff pull rank, with 3 contenders it will become a political decision.<br><br>Eurofighter good on paper, have flown and crashed, will take long time to reach production, delivery will take many more years to reach us, definately a pipe dream, you out here. If we get I be very surprised and I'll recommend the steering commitee be shot.<br><br>Rafale excellent bird and already operational with froggy, they desperate for funding to keep it in the program more importantly they need us to endorse it for them and they are most eager to please, for that they willing to give us the moon which is what we want. My feeling is with this one.<br><br>F-15, sure it's a good workhorse but an old one and doesn't outclass cheaper rivals like the advanced russian SU fighters that many have bought, other than extending the aircraft production program for a few more years which keep american people in jobs, there is no advantage or any benefit at all for us, no tech sharing or any goodies, and who knows if another president comes to power he won't Screw us over it again ... at a time when maybe we need it most. They need the program now as a interim but in the long run the yanks don't need this fighter anymore when they get more F-22 delivered and JSF comes fully online they will scrap the program, If we get it we doing the yanks a favor by subsidising them and helping keep the program alive, whether they return the favor in the end is anybody's wild guess.</div>
