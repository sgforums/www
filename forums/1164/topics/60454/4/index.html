So they 'float', speeding towards the enemy flight and kill the rocket boost, floating towards the bombers. Certainly the Komets are having a death wish if flying by themselves, so they have the 109s or the 190s to cover their backs. Who knows how they land, since they jettison the wheels when taking off.</div></blockquote>They landed using skids.They were launched when needed...usually when enemy bombers were near...They would use the rocket to take of and gain altitude.They would then swoop in fire off either a pod of rockets  or cannon fire into the pack of bombers and then turn around to land.Landing was extremely hard and most pilots where killed then.However from what i know not many komets were used at all.<br>Anyway so carrier planes had bigger bodies due to their engines being designed bigger?hmm...ok...interesting.Anyway the Zero was a pretty average fighter in IMHO....though compare to carrier planes i guess it's pretty good.I mean a p51,FW190 or even the bf 109 would most prob kick it's ass right??<br>a little piece of trivia..the p51 was designed and test flown in 100days!This was after the US airforce rejected the spitfire and said it could come up with a better plane in 100 days!And the 1st test flight of the p51 ended in it's crash landing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

The training aircraft were based here since good bases abounded (Seletar, Sembawang, Tengah and Kallang) while training could be done over Malaya or Riau since they were all occupied territories. In addition, the old Naval Base was used as a main Repair Dock for IJN ships, and the Southern HQ here also required defending. Hence fighters were based here. The sea-lanes needed defending against Allied subs, so anti-sub aircraft units were based here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah, irrespective of QNH, KIAS, DI, VSI, AH, RPM and whatever factors, the bottomline is whether the Komet could have broken the sound barrier in a dive?  for e.g., the Harrier can hit Mach 1 in a dive.  Yeager is officially recognised as the 1st guy to hit Mach 1, and he did it in a Bell X1 in Dec '53.<br><br>My question remains unanswered:  would it have been possible to accomplish the same feat in the Komet in '45?  i.e. could the germans have accomplished the same feat as the the Americans, but earlier?</div>

The Komet was not designed for that kind of speed. The wings would have ripped off before the Komet reached anywhere near Mach 1.</div>
