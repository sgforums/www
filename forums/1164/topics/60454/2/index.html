It was destined to be the last piston-engined fighter ordered by the USAAF. Design was begun in January 1944. The aircraft consits of two P-51H Mustang fuselage joined together by a constant chord wing centre section and a rectangular tailplane. The pilot was housed in the port fuselage. The second pilot/navigator is in the starboard section.</div>

One of those was a carrier-based <span style="font-style: italic;">Kokutai </span>based at Seletar for crew training in 1943-44 and was decimated in the Battle of Philippine Sea in June 1944 (better known as the Marianas Turkey Shoot)<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by superspitfire:<strong><br>Here's one fact I just found out...The Zeros never took part in dogfights over Singapore - that was done by the Japanese Army Air Force's Nakajima Ki.27.</strong></blockquote>Actually superspitfire, thats slightly inaccurate. During the invasion of Malaya and Singapore the 22nd Naval Air Flotilla of the IJN has a small fighter unit attached to it (along with the bomber <span style="font-style: italic;">Kokutais</span> that sank the Prince of Wales and Repulse) which consisted of land-based Navy Zeros. (tailhook removed). They did take part in limited missions escorting bombers and performing fighter sweeps over Singapore.<br><br>You're right, however when you said that most of the air-to-air work over Singapore was done by the Nakajima Ki-27 'Nate'. Two Imperial Japanese Army <span style="font-style: italic;">Sentai </span>(Fighter Regiments) were equiped with the 'Nate' during the invasion, along with 1 more <span style="font-style: italic;">Sentai</span> equiped with the new (at that time) Ki-43 <span style="font-style: italic;">Hayabusa</span> (Allied code-name 'Oscar')</div>
