Remember that there were naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire and German's Bf-109. Although these were not as powerful as their land base counterparts because their engines were smaller. But if you look at the 1st page and see the F4U Corsair, you'll notice that its extremely sleek for a carrer based fighter/attacker... Its engines were also one of the most powerful during its time... (Wasp radial 2800) being able to outclimb "zeros", using energy fighting tactics to destroy the slower moving planes...<br>Because of the Corsair's powerful torque effects of its engine, it was nicknamed "<span style="color: red;">Ensign Eliminator</span>" by its pilots.<br><br>Also to add, the FM-2 / F4F "Wildcat" has plenty of armor due to its extremely fat body. This allows US pilots to adope an aerial combat manuever (ACM) called the "<span style="color: red;">Teche weave</span>[/color]". In this manuever, 2 "Wildcats" will fly abreast each other and will weave back and fourth. When a "Zero" saddeled on one of the "Wildcat's" tail, his wingman will then be able to get into a advantage attack position when they cross each other in the weave.<br><br>Those above points are how naval planes defend themselves... either using <span style="color: red;">speed, armour or wingman tactics</span>...<br><br>Also you might want to know that most naval planes have terrible range... land based fighters such as the P-51 Mustang have far greater range than those of the sea...</div>

It is a defensive manouever used in the Battle of Midway which was named after Lieutenant Commander John S. Thatch. Realising that his F4F Wildcats were no match against the Zeros in single fights, his solution is to fight in pairs and the best way to fight using pairs is using the weave.</div>

The ME-163 is rocket-powered and after around 7.5-8.0 minutes of flight, oops, no rocket fuel. Think the pilots who flew the "Komet" in battle could have thought of ideas to survive.</div>

From what I gather, Singapore was used as a training area as well as a holding point for war material (replacement aircraft, units etc).<br><br>Well, the Block 52 is not my favourite plane, but it certainly was the inspiration for my nick!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the Allies found a large stock of Ohkas in Singapore. They were apparently stored here and planned for use when the Allies invaded Malaya and Singapore (plans were afoot but the surrender meant it was never carried out). Which was also the reason why Japanese presence here was strong.<br><br>In addition, the British also found numerous Japanese aircraft here, in various condition (some wrecked some airworthy). The Allied Technical and Intelligence Unit - South East Asia (ATAIU-SEA) took over several of these aircraft (some A6M Zeros, a couple of J2M Raidens 'Jacks', a A6M2-N Rufe floatplane, a G4M Betty bomber and a Ki-46 Dinah recon) and put them through technical evaluations in Tebrau, just across the Johor Straits from Singapore.<br><br>Several pictures exist of these aircraft being flown with British markings and "ATAIU-SEA" painted on them!</div>

Many a time the wing tip will dip when the a/c is still at high speed and when the wing tip hit the ground you can imagine what will happen!!<br><br>I read somewhere that more pilots were killed during landing in training/operation than killed in combat.<br></div>
