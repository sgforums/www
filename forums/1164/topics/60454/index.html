With altitude, you'll have speed, advantage, an basically everything. A low flying A6M Zeke cannot touch a Spirfire which is flying 1000 feet higher. If the Zeke tries that, he'll bleed all his energy and speed away which makes him a sitting duck. The Spitfire pilot on the otherhand can climb when he sees the Zeke coming from lower. This will cause enough seperation of the two of the planes. Once the Zeke bleeds all his energy away, the Spitfire can then hammer his rudder and drop back down to the required angle of attack to continue the manuever.<br><br>This theory works extremely well for modern jet fighters too. You can always attack a target lower than you. But never try attacking a target higher. Because he has ALL the advantages.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Germans called the P-38 the "forked Tail Devil". It's climb rate isn't really the best. The Japanese Kawasaki Ki-84 can actually out climb the Lockheed P-38 Lightning if the pilot starts with an altitude / speed advantage.<br><br>What the P-38 excels its that both propellers are counter-rotating which in turn, eliminate torque effects.<br><br>It is a very popular plane among pilots because it's a plane with a very low stall speed. (60 knots with full flaps) This in turn makes landing extremely easy.<br><br>The P-38 is the TRUE master of the <span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HAMMERHEAD</span></span> ACM move. Single engine planes such as the German's BF-109 and FW-190 will tend to torque roll at low speed / vertical manuevers.<br><br>The P-38 was also the 1st plane in service to have all flushed metal riverted skin, tricycle landing gear, turbo-charged engines, one nose mounted cannon (AN-M1) and 4 machine guns (.50 cal MK-2)<br><br>Its nose mounted armaments removes all gun convergence issues which is a major problem in both the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane. (Hurricanes have a factory default gun convergence of 400 yards. If the pilot fires at a target at say, 200 yards, the bullets will simply fly right past the target plane. Pilots solved the problem by tuning their guns. P-38s don't have convergence which makes its guns very accurate even at long distances.<br><br>Also to add. The P-38 gained most credit when it <span style="color: red;">shot down</span> the Mitsubishi G4M "Betty" carring Japanese Admiral<span style="color: red;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yamamoto</span></span>.<br><br>There are two drawbacks to the P-38 design.<br><br>1.) It's unique size makes it an extremely <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">big</span></span> target. It's easy to spot it from a distance.<br><br>2.) The P-38's air-frame wasn't designed to go anywhere above 250 knots / 400 mph. Many loss of the P-38 were due to over-speeding, causing the plane's air-frame to "compress" at high speeds, which in turn, locking up the controls. Newer models of the P-38 had "Dive-brakes" installed to correct this problem.<br><br>I think that's about it all. Maybe someone can continue for me here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not entirely sure. What I know is that the B-29 with their super-charged engines can bring them well over 35.000 feet - 38.000 feet. Japan did try intercepting them with their Ki-61, Ki-84 and the Ki-100. The problem is that fighters tend to be extremely sluggish at high-altitudes due to thinner air. With this, Japanese fighters wasn't "quite" able to reach them.<br><br>As for the escorts, certain day-flying B-29 formation did have P-51 fighter escorts. During night bombing missions, they usually fly along with hundreds of other B-29 in tight formation.<br><br>wow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a military buff myself...I cannot help but answering this as well<br><br>I personally love the Spitfire ever since I watched this movie 'Battle of Britain', its slick wings and speed just impresses me...also the P-40, ableit the B and C models since this are the models used by Claire Lee Chennault's American Volunteer Group (AVG, better known as The Flying Tigers).<br><br>As for the Pacific Theatre, couple of planes stood as my favourite, for instance, the F4U Corsair, great plane with excellent diving characteristics, fought side by side with the F6F Hellcat against the Japanese.<br><br>The P38 is also an absolute favourite, flown by the top American WW2 fighter ace, Richard Bong and its design is well-suited for the Pacific, totally outperforming the Zero, unlike its previous performance in the Med. or in ETO.<br><br>Speaking of ETO, my favourites are the P-47D, excelling in ground attack and the P-51D Mustang, the plane that changed the tide of war in Europe.<br><br>Do you also know that the P-47 is responsible for the surrender of a German division in WW2, making it  the first in military history where ground forces surrendered to an air unit.<br><br>well, that's my 2 cents..</div>

It was the place where 4 historic RAF types flew their respective RAF operational missions, they are:<br><br>Supermarine Spitfire - PR.XIX of 81 Sqn in Apr 1955<br>DH Mosquito - PR.34 RG314 of 81 Sqn in Dec 1955<br>Shorts Sunderland - ML797 'P' of 205 Sqn in May 1959<br>Bristol Beaufighter - TT.10 RD761 of 1524 Flight(?) in May 1960<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another book I can recommend is 'Lion in the Sky' by Sqn Ldr Neville Shorrick (an ex-RAF officer based at Seletar). Book was written in the 60s, so memories of events were still fresh then. Details the story of Seletar from its birth in the 1930s (Do you know Jalan Kayu is named after an Englishman?) to the late 1960s when the RAF left (including the Occupation in the 40s). some wonderful b/w pics of lots of things, aircraft and people of Seletar<br><br>Long out-of-print unfortunately, tho' I got my copy from a bookshop in New Zealand via mail order.<br><br></div>
