              <p>Recently i recieved a mail stating that i have to register for NS.And so i did.After which,i was promted to book a medical check-up before i can finish the registration and so i did.</p>
              <p>I am currently studying in Secondary 5 this year and i have plans to further my studies in Poly after O's.So my question is that is it necessary for me to go for the check-up since i won't be enlisting anytime soon.</p>

              the medical fitness of a pre-enlistee to be assessed and this
              subsequently determines his Physical Employment Status (PES).<br> <br> <strong style="font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit;">Medical
