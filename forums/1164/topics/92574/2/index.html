            <div class='col-md body'>YES!!! Pulau "Sotong" life firing!!! Best fun I'd ever had in my whole army life.<br><br>No need to dig trench cos trench all there already. The officers hinted to us that this will be an "easy" excercise so we prepared lots of food and even alcohol. So after the excercise at night we went to sleep on the xxx and had a picnic. (just removed some info there - tvdog.)<br><br>The excercise itself was fun. Night firing with all the parachute flares, tracers. I borrowed the M203 gunner's weapon to fire curry powder rounds.<br><br>The excercise simulate attempted landing by enemy force in high speed crafts.<br><br>There was a day shoot and a night shoot. After the day shoot basically talk kok sing song. So someone with a 3-tonner "accidentally" knocked down a coconut tree. So all of us had coconuts to eat.<br><br>For night firinf, our order of fire began with 81mm mortars firing flares. Then the 84mm started shooting. Very loud buggers. Then the GPMG start firing. The rest of us with 5.56mm weapons had to wait till the simulated enemy "approached" to within 300m before we start firing.<br><br>Beautiful light show. Got money also cannot buy.</div>

SAF is very safety conscious. The safety officers will mark the extreme boudaries of your field of fire, either with white tape or red lanterns or something physical (e.g. do not shoot beyond that row of trees on your right 200m distant... etc etc).<br><br>The so-called "enemy targets" could be different coloured cyalume sticks or protected red lights or in more sophisticated scenarios, they will be  proper IR reflective targets. You are supposed to aim only at those enemy markers ... nothing else.<br><br>A round travels very far ... and will still kill someone at its terminal velocity, so the SAF is very careful here. There will some kind of butt-stop at the end of the range (such as a hill or sand bags). Not sure about coastal/ Sudong LF, how they ensure the GPMG round does not go on and on and hit a ship or something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever poke a straight stick into the water and see how it appears to be "bent".<br><br>When the rounds hit the water, it will go straight. But from the outside, when we look at the light, it appear to be "deflected" or bent....<br><br>I think what most of you seeing is a optical illusion.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If only I can place an illustration here. It's beginning to sound like we're talking about UFOs with just as many conflicting theories.<br><br>Anyway, let me try and describe the path of the tracer hitting the water.<br><br>Fire! tracer travels straight at great speed. Hits water and suddenly BOUNCES upwards at an almost 90 degree angle for 3 or 4 feet into the air and then extinguishing. When it bounces upwards the speed is not fast like a bullet at all.<br><br>So please stop talking about the bullet bounce or got deflected or anything.<br><br>It is just the phosphorous liquid that is bouncing upwards, NOT the bullet.</div>
