            <div class='col-md body'>Have seen red and green tracer rounds before.But when u load an entire belt of 7.62 Tracer for the GPMG,and fire it,you will get an entire star-wars effect.Woohoo!!!!wahahah,and yes,its true that the round will ignite flammabe substances when it has not burned out yet.Saw some cock during the night shoot at the Army Open house,shoot at the wooden range marker,and the tracer just simply burn a hole there.The round basically just get stuck and burns there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tracer are use at night. This is because it is hard to tell or point to where the enemy is, so when enemy is spotted , you shoot at him, everyone in the team just see where your tracer fly to will know enemy is there.<br><br>Usually it is every fifth rounds, you don't want too much tracers, as it wear out your barrel faster and let enemy know where you are also.<br><br>Tracers round is good for ignite things like flamiable stuff. Use tracer to shoot at gas tanks and stuff.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's why tracers are used sparingly. (one in every five) so to reduce your "signature"<br><br>and flash supressors are used to, well, supress flashes at the muzzle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree that tracer rounds are basically to check accuracy at night (variously interpretable).<br><br>With regards of the effects "working both ways", I'll say the 1st enemy instinct isn't so much to see immediately where you're firing from, but rather which direction the rounds are coming from - &amp; taking appropriate defensive cover accordingly.<br><br>Imagine it being pitch dark &amp; all you hear, like a blindman, is the rifle report.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tracers have a burning element on the base of the bullet. When fired most of the light is seen after the bullet actually flies past you. Looking head on it is possible but difficult to determine the source of the tracer round, although from an angle it is easier.<br><br>It is seldom able to ignite anything when shot at unless the bullet stays long enough on any flamable material to spark anything. Forget Hollywood, a burning car or fuel tank seldoms explodes with such dramatic effect when shot with tracers, its more the fumes catching fire after it has split a bit.<br><br>Infantry SOP combat load is a mix of tracers, ball, ball... tracer... ball etc to indicate first and last few rounds (leave it at that).<br></div>

I was in the support section armed with GPMG, 60mm mortar (for firing illum rounds only), and the rest of the section armed with M16 HB on bipods (heavy barrels... this was the time in 1983 when the SAW was not in full service). Ammo load was one in 3 rounds tracer.<br>The M16 HB operators were allowed to fire burst of 3 to 5 rounds.<br>I was the only idiot with ordinary M16 and had to fire single directed fire (I was also the nominated section i/c which explains my equipment). GPMG was also firing tracer but not sure of the tracer load.<br><br>We were firing over the heads of the other sections moving up the enemy objective.<br><br>THAT WAS ONE GREAT LIGHT SHOW. All the different weapons had different light effects.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup , Sudong defence nite live firing , one of the best experience encountered in my army stint.<br><br>My whole section exchanged weapons to fire with eachother weapon, the only opportunity for me to fire my M-16 in full auto mode with live rounds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>You will see all kind of infantry weapons firing due to the tracer  and illum rounds. A sight like firework but with sound effects!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
