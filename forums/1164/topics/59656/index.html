            <div class='col-md body'>I remember a few nasty incidences during my time :<br>-   during PT run, 1 fellow had shortness of breath.  He stopped but was pulled along by the officer.  Ended up choking on his vomit and fainted with heat exhaustion.  Not a pretty scene seeing his face turning blue.<br>-   1 night, officer was in bad mood.  ordered the platoon out for tekan session.  forced 1 fellow to do push ups with full pack and 84mm.  that fellow ended up with slip disc and was down graded.<br>-   1 fellow did not did hos fire trench fast enough.  officer made him hold a lighted flashbang and allowed him to run to another trench before he can throw it off.  He did not make it and lost his thumb nail.<br>-   1 fellow did not perform his 'take cover' drill well enough.  sergent made him do it on rocky slope.  that fellow slipped and lost his bottom 2 front teeth.<br>-   1 section did not make to check point in reasonable time.  sergent made the section leopard crawl to the next check point.  the section ended up with very bad cuts to knees and elbows.  No. 4 was covered in blood.  Whole section was attend C for 7 days and got out of course and kana recourse.<br>-   officer not happy with platoon loading up the 3 tonner.  made the platoon go in and out of tonner.  1 fellow ended up with broken shoulder blade and got down graded.<br>-   motar section was tired and did not keep surrounding area clean.  sergent made section run round the motar pit carrying motar rounds.  1 fellow ended up with a crush toe and 1 fellow ended up with a crushed thumb (you see, kind of hard running around in pitch darkness carrying 2 of those 120mm rounds)<br>How to have faith in the system ?  sigh ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh ... i also remember this weird incident.<br>during jungle training, fresh ration was delivered.  after eating the platoon threw the left over food into the bin.  the Incik saw the trash and was not happy.  carried the bin up, dumped the pile onto the dirt and ordered the platoon to eat off the pile left on the dirt.  so we ended up digging up dirt and trash from the ground with out hands and had to put in mouth, stand in line and show him we are chewing and swallowing the food.<br>lost respect for WOs with ranger tag on shoulder forever.<br><br>p.s.  the Incik say because our food was not tasty enough, he 'added ingredients' by kicking dirt into the food pile some more.<br><br>p.s.   after that the company pleaded with future jungle training will be supported with c-rations only.  was not approved because c-ration cost more than fresh ration.</div>
