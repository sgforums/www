It has stated a need for at least one, but possibly up to three, LPD-type unit that is to be procured under the program known as LPX. This ship would displace around 10,000 tons and would significantly enhance KoreaÂ’s current AMW capability, both in terms of assault and OOTW operations.<br><br>The LPX program, similar to the Japanese Ohsumi type LPD, could be regarded as another effort to have a greater regional influence. A new design amphibious landing ship, the LPX is planned for delivery in 2005. This ship will displace approximately 10,000 tons. ROK Navy desires the ship to have a large flight deck like a helicopter carrier; a flooding well deck to accommodate Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAVÂ’s) and Landing Cushion Aircraft (LCAC) is being considered. The New LPD will carry 700 troops, 10 helicopters, and 12 landing craft<br><br>By August 2001 a substantial portion of Korea's W10 trillion weapon introduction projects were facing delay due to budget and political reasons. Budget authorities were been reluctant to earmark funds to the projects citing the economic slump. Major projects facing indefinite postponement are the Air Force's W1.8 trillion E-X (airborne early warning control system) project and advanced anti-aircraft missile SAM-X system and the Navy's new landing ship LP-X projects.<br><br>As of September 2002, SMART-L and SPS-48E were in competition for LPX's 3D VSR. SPN-46 and SPN-720 were also in the running for LPX's precision approach control radar.<br></div>

Such Â“amphibiousÂ” capabilities of the Korean Navy have been limited to four 4,300-ton Kojoonbong-class landing ships and four 4,080-ton Unbong-class landing ships given to it by the United States after use in World War II.<br><br>Japan has built three Osumi-class landing ships since 1998, but their payload -- 330 unarmed men and 10 armored vehicles -- is far short of the LPX. Japan deployed Osumi-class vessels when it sent troops to Iraq and during relief operations following the South Asian tsunami of late 2004.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jevis Bay and HSV-1 are built by Austal of Australia. They are what we called the Wave Piercing Catamaran.<br><br>Most catamaran suffer from bad quarter sea rolling. Coupled with pitch, this gives you a very uncomfortable ride and is likely to get many onboard sea sick.<br><br>Austal's wave piercing catamaran combine modern hull shaping with active ride control to give a much reduced motion thus giving a comfortable ride compared to the traditional catamaran.<br><br>I think RAN has returned Jevis Bay to Austral following their East Timor operation. US Army is operating 2 of them (HSV1 and HSV2).</div>
