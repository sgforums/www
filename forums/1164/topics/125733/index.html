            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.sinodefence.com/airforce/fighter/j10fighter_1lg.jpg"><br><br>J-10 MULTIROLE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT<br><br>The Jian-10 (J-10) is the multirole fighter aircraft developed by 611 Aircraft Design Institute (Chengdu) and built by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Corporation (CAC). Development of the J-10 began in 1984 and the first low-rate initial production variant was delivered to the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) in 2002. Around 300 aircraft are expected to be built. The J-10 is available in two variants: the single seat fighter J-10A and the two-seat fighter-trainer J-10B.<br><br>PROGRAMME<br><br>The J-10 fighter was developed in the early 1980s as a counter to the Soviet UnionÂ’s emerging fourth-generation fighters such as the MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker. The original requirement was air superiority, but the break-up of the Soviet Union and changing requirements shifted development towards a high-performance multirole fighter aircraft to replace the ageing J-6s and J-7s that are the backbone of ChinaÂ’s air force. The J-10 is based on the Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI)Â’s Lavi fighter. After the Lavi programme was cancelled in 1987, its design was taken over by CAC, and IAI carried on with the development of avionic equipment.<br><br>The PLAAF originally planned to fit the J-10 fighter with Western-made turbofan engine and fire-control radar. Following the event in June 1989, the U.S. and other Western countries imposed an arms ban on China, which almost traumatised the J-10Â’s development. However, the end of the Cold War enabled China to seek advanced aviation and defence technologies from its new alley Russia, who agreed to provide the AL-31F turbofan engine to power the J-10. As a result, the rear portion of the J-10Â’s airframe had to be re-designed to fit the Russian powerplant, and this has caused further delays in the aircraftÂ’s development.<br><br>The J-10 first flew in 1998, but the aircraft suffered serious problems with the fly-by-wire (FBW) software, which resulted in the loss of the No.2 prototype and its pilot in 1999. After some re-design work, the revised J-10 successfully flew in 1998. By 2000 a total of six prototypes (1001~1006) had been built. Three more prototypes (1007~1009) were built between 2000 and 2002. The low-rate initial production of the J-10 was authorised in 2002, and the first batch is expected to include about fifty aircraft fitted with Russian AL-31F engines. The two-seat J-10B fighter-trainer aircraft successfully flew in 2003.<br><br>The J-10 is expected to achieve initial operating capability by 2005~2006, and the first operational regiment of the J-10 is reported to be the PLAAF 44th Aviation Division based in Sichuan Province. The PLAAF was estimated to have a total requirement of 300 aircraft, but this may be reduced to less than 100 as a result of the introduction of the more capable Su-30MK multirole fighter. The CAC is also trying to replace the Russian AL-31F with the indigenously developed WS-10A, which is said to be a Chinese copy of the AL-31FN. The J-10 may become available for export market in 2005~2006.<br><br>DESIGN<br><br>The single-engine J-10 fighter is similar in size to the Lockheed Martin F-16, with a rectangle belly air intake, low-mounted delta wings and a pair of from canard wings. The design is aerodynamically unstable, to provide a high level of agility, low drag and enhanced lift. The pilot controls the aircraft through a computerised digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, which provides artificial stabilisation and gust elevation to give good control characteristics throughout the flight envelope. The J-10 is also the first Chinese-made fighter to be fitted with a large two-piece bubble canopy to give the pilot a better view in close air combat.<br><br>COCKPIT<br><br>The J-10's cockpit is fitted with three flat-panel liquid crystal multifunction displays (MFDs), including one colour MFD, wide field-of-view head-up display (HUD), and possibly helmet-mounted sight (HMS). It is not know whether the HMS is the basic Ukrainian Arsenel HMS copied by China's Luoyang Avionics, or a new helmet display featured briefly at the 2000 Zhuhai air show.<br><br>The pilot manipulates the J-10 by the Iron Bird quadruple (four channels) digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system. The pilot is also aided by advanced autopilot and air data computer.<br><br>RADAR<br><br>The J-10 is reported to be fitted with an indigenous KLJ-3 pulse-Doppler fire-control radar developed by Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology (also known as 14th Institute). The KLJ-3 radar, which might be based on early variant AN/APG-66/68 technology, is said to have a maximum detecting range of 100~130km (attacking range 80~90km), and is capable of engaging two targets simultaneously. The radar system was tested on a Y-7 aerial radar testbed before being fitted on the J-10.<br><br>Russian company Phazotron is prompting its Zhuk-10PD, a version of the system in later Su-27s, with 160km search range and ability to track up to six targets. Israel has also offered its Elta EL/M-2035 radar for competition.<br><br>For low-level navigation and precision strike, a forward-looking infrared and laser designation pod is likely to be carried F-16-style on an inlet stores station. A Chinese designed pod similar to the Israeli Rafael Litening was revealed at the 1998 Zhuhai air show.<br><br>POWERPLANT<br><br>The initial low-rate production J-10s are powered by the 27,500lb-thrust (120kN) Russian Lyulka-Saturn AL-31F turbofan rated at 17,857 lb (79.43 kN) dry and 27,557 lb st (122.58 kN) with afterburning. The same powerplant is also being used by Chinese air force's Su-27s and Su-30s. Lyulka-Saturn reportedly delivered 54 AL-31F turbofan engines to China between 2002 and 2004. These are the AL-31FN model with special modifications to be fitted in the J-10.<br><br>China is also developing its own WS-10A turbofan powerplant, and it could be fitted on the later versions of the J-10. An all-aspect vectored-thrust version of the AL-31F was revealed for the first time at Zhuhai Air Show 1998, leading to speculation that this advanced engine may wind up on the J-10, potentially conferring phenomenal manoeuvrability.<br><br>WEAPONS<br><br>The fixed weapon on the J-10 is a 23mm internal cannon. The aircraft also has 11 stores stations - six under the wing and five under the fuselage. The inner wing and centre fuselage stations are plumped to carry external fuel tanks. Fixed weapon is a 23-mm inner cannon hidden inside fuselage.<br><br>In addition to the PL-8 short-range infrared-guided air-to-air missile reportedly derived from Israeli Rafael Python-3 technology, the J-10 could also carry Russian Vympel R-73 (AA-11) short-range and R-77 (AA-12) medium-range missiles equipped by Chinese Flankers. It may also be fitted with indigenously developed PL-11 or PL-12 medium-range AAM for BVR combat.<br><br>For ground attack missions, the J-10 will carry laser-guided bombs, YJ-8K anti-ship missile, as well as various unguided bombs and rockets. Some missiles currently under development such as the YJ-9 ramjet-powered anti-radiation missile may also be carried by the J-10.<br><br>SPECIFICATIONS<br><br>Crew: 1 (basic variant); 2 (fighter-trainer variant)<br>Dimensions: N/A<br>Weight: N/A<br>Max Speed: Mach 1.2 (sea-level) or Mach 2.0 (high altitude)<br>Range: Combat radius over 550km<br>Service Ceiling: N/A<br>Max Climb Rate: N/A<br>G Limit: N/A</div>
