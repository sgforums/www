            <div class='col-md body'>According to the news, both countries are already settled down to peaceful negotiations.<br><br>It'll cost more to fight a war than the oil itself.<br><br>But of course, both sides must wayang a bit before they can proceed to the negotiation table so as to sit down from a position of "strength".<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>But for the sake of "what if" scenario...<br><br>While what some people said about TNI and MAF are true, I would actually say that both sides will be very well matched.<br><br>THis is because I assume they will "localise" the conflict at first and fight just at the disputed area.<br><br>This means both sides will have to despatch expeditionary forces. And they will each send a limited amount of their manpower and hardware while keeping the rest for defence.<br><br>Attacks on actual territory like mainland East Malaysia would be useful diversions to stretch MAF's resources. But again I stress this will not happen at first as it will start as a "limited" war.<br><br>Reference Falklands. England did not touch mainland Argentina itself or the SLOC around it though it was contemplated. The fighting was kept to the islands itself. To attack Argentina would motivate the entire Argentinian population which was what Argentina needed and England cleverly avoided.<br><br>So like I said, LET THEM FIGHT and the news at 9 would be damn interesting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>before FPDA there were this AMDA...<br><br><blockquote>Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement (AMDA) provided a security umbrella for independent Malaya. AMDA (unlike the future FPDA), was a bilateral defence agreement. When Malaysia was formally created in 1963 (without Brunei's inclusion), AMDA - renamed the Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement -continued to provide some measure of security to the new federation. Just as important, ANZUK forces were still based in Butterworth and Singapore. These forces helped Malaysia resist Indonesia's policy of "Confrontation" which included military action or terrorist activities in <strong>Johor, Singapore, and Sarawak</strong>.</blockquote>then the FPDA..<br><br><blockquote>The Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) were agreed in 1971 and committed Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and UK to consult in the event of an attack on <strong>Singapore or Malaysia</strong>. </blockquote><blockquote>Australian Treaty Series 1971 No 21<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">EXCHANGE OF NOTES CONSTITUTING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAYSIA ON ASSISTANCE REGARDING EXTERNAL DEFENCE</span><br><br>I have the honour to refer to the Exchange of Letters between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Federation of Malaya on 24 March and 21 April 1959, associating Australia with the Agreement on External Defence and Mutual Assistance between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Federation of Malaya; to the Exchange of Letters between the Government of Australia and the Government of Malaysia on 17 and 18 September 1963, extending Australia's association with the Defence Agreement <strong>to all the territories of Malyasia</strong>; and to the Communique issued by representatives of the Governments of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom at the conclusion of the Ministerial Meeting in London on 16 April 1971, to consider matters of common interest to all five Governments relating to the external defence of Malaysia and Singapore.</blockquote><blockquote>Australian Treaty Series 1971 No 21<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">EXCHANGE OF NOTES CONSTITUTING AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE REGARDING EXTERNAL DEFENCE</span><br><br>I have the honour to refer to the communique issued by representatives of the Governments of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom at the conclusion of the Ministerial meeting in London on 16 April 1971 to consider matters of common interest to all five Governments relating to the defence of Malaysia and Singapore.
