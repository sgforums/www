So we shouldn't assume that their sea-lift assets are non-functional.<br><br>However, they are also vulnerable to maritime strikes from RMAF F/A-18Ds as well.  I discounted the MiG-29Ns since they've already been sent to the freezer. If Singapore was to find the sea-lift assets to be of sufficient threat to our own security, I think we would not sit back idly too.  Unfortunately, I could not find a single reference to our F-16Ds being Harpoon capable to carry out a maritime strike.</div>

Normal defence odds are 3:1.  Dug in with arty support can increase to 7:1 or more.  The more of troops/supplies/armour/arty/fuel/ammunition you bring.. the less of the previously mentioned other 5 options you have.<br><br>2)Troops condition will -drop- the longer they are at sea. They will not be in 100% fighting condition should they have to take a sea-lift then onto a few days trek  inland to their objectives.<br><br>3) Time coordination between a coastal assault and a land assault must be well coordinated to maximise Firepower else it will might as well be two seperate weaker attacks.<br><br>4) I was also clearly stating the usage of TNI-AL sealift at kalimantan - what do you have to protect the LSTs from intrusions of RMN/RSN, RMAF/RSAF units from deploying weapon systems against them.<br><br>5) LSTs being used inland doesnt mean it's well "within TNI-AU protection and well beyond RMAF reach" How would you deal with a strike package of F-18s carrying harpoons escorted with a Mig-29s in interceptor role maybe even guided by a E2-C somewhere? &lt;--Consider this is only a RMAF senario.<br><br>A worse senario will be that of a screen of F-18s &amp; Mig 29s in interceptor role....followed by a strike package of F-16Ds with close escorts of F-16Cs in fighter/attack arming.

Hence I have no interest in compromising national security.<br><br>Given the 2 reasons. I'd say we do not have Viper/Harpoon Capabilities. =)<br><br>As far as I remember, we purchased ship launched harpoons more than air launched ones.  Which are not interchangeable.   Also, to launch the harpoon, its not simply wiring up the harpoon the Viper.  To accurately use the harpoons u need the software to provide the harpoon with targeting information.  Unfortunately for our Blk52 F-16s, I doubt we have that kinda plug and play capability to be able to shoot it.  I can plug a USB infrared mouse to the F-16, but it doesnt mean the Viper's computer knows how to use it.</div>

I fully agree.  But which country doesn't wayang their armed forces in exercises.  Everytime a soldier goes back for ICT to wayang their range, and hopefully earn $200 for their marksman badge, their skills improve through their wayang-ing. Every time the gunners live fire or goes through the sequence of live firing their 155s, their speed and response improves from their wayang.  Maybe all they want to hear is "Exercise Cut." So be it.<br><br>But in a war, that soldier with that marksman badge will be engaging the enemy with his Sar-21, and there will be REAL 5.56mm rounds flying towards the enemy's direction with accuracy.  Like it or not, that bullet is gonna hurt when it lands on someone.<br><br>True, SAF does lack combat experience.  We don't have any war veterans.  But hey, check out the veteran US Army/ Marines!  Whats their latest body count?  People die in war, veteran or green horns.  An "Elite" (from your Command and  Conquer point of view) is gonna die when an IED goes off under his Hummer.  Or when a 155mm shell saturates the area.  Oh wait.. i forgot in Command and Conquer, where Long range missiles and Stealth bombers can level a base, the "Elites" can regenerate health.  (Oh wait, or did they take less damage when a nuke lands on them?)<br><br>Strange, haven't heard of any US Army veteran coming back from the dead yet....<br><br>But hey, even though they are dying out in Iraq, those men at least have the balls to take the fight to the enemy (most of them fanatical and VETERAN mujahideen fighters)  in Iraq.  They got the balls to bring themselves, their technology over, to ensure the battle is fought OUTSIDE US soil.  That the IEDs are going off in Iraq, and not in Washington DC.<br><br>So what does that tell us?  Veterancy is bullshit when you are not in don't have "God Mode" or Impulse 101.

But our friend here wasn't referring to that kinda experience.  That he called "wayang."<br><br>His experience perhaps is closer defined by a soldier who killed 3 orcs, and got 300exp for his bravery and story to tell at the Shimmering Sword Tavern.<br><br>Sure these kinda folks are nice to have when training recruits.  On how bullets used to whiz over their heads but still had to carry out their fire movement bravely.  And of course, how they made it back in one piece and not in a bodybag.<br><br>However, these folks were also green once.  They too learned to have fighting spirit and professionalism in the face of their adversaries, and thats why they survived.  So thats what we should aim to imbue, and hopefully enough of them will walk out of any war we get into, as veterans.  We have to start SOMEWHERE.<br><br>Somehow, I suspect that the SAF has a pretty good source of doctrine updates.  No doubt acquired from "wayangs" with other armed forces.  We couldn't have possibly developed SPH doctrines on our own when the Primus first came on.  I'm sure we had good references, and we adopted them, modified them to work here.  The good thing about the age of computers is that we don't need to be under live fire to see what works and what doesn't.  Simulations reveal key logistical and tactical flaws for us to re-think our approaches.<br><br>Some factors that the electronic exercises don't take into account.  The human factor for example.  While the computer maybe able to simulate proficiency, it might not be easy to simulate testicular fortitude (i love these 2 words) to fight.<br><br>So, we may not have war veterans to tell us the harshness and the feeling of coming under fire.  We lack the emotional training for that.  But we've also established that skills and doctrines are not acquire from just experience alone, but also with friendly and professional relations with foreign militarys.<br><br>If "veterancy" were the essentials of an army, then they would probably have never gotten on the right foot in any battle.  Fighting Spirit and Professionalism is what we need to get ourselves to start in the right direction.  And if our Kiasuism can make its way into the the Oxford English Dictionary, I have confidence that the SAF will make its mark in battle should that day come.  Thats because we are starting on the right foot.</div>

TNI moves 100,000 soldiers to sumatra. (obviously to pin MAF forces in peninsula down.)<br><br>given that both sides dont have strong air power.... the eastern front would mostly be a land warfare deal...<br><br>as for RMAF, you need not consider its effect on the war.. since they are too few in number to be of any practical use... especially if you divide it by 3 between ops, maintainance and standby... then divide it further by 3 with 2/3 for peninsula malaysia and remaing 1/3 for east malaysia.<br><br>even if we discount mahatir statement about the useless hornet in RMAF inventory due to lack of source code.....<br><br>a simple example... 8 RMAF hornet... divide in by 3 you get about 2.5, divide in by another 3... you get near zero availability for east malaysia.<br><br>and while fighters of modern day is capable of multi-role... they cannot do more then 1 role as effectively, simply because they cannot be at two places at the same time, a hornet on CAS cannot be on MS (maritime strike) at the same time.<br><br>the turnaround time as well as pilot fatigue also eats heavily into the availability of the machine to support front line forces.<br><br>please tell us... how you gonna defend yourself.<br><br>oh... if really one on one.. MAF vs TNI... TNI at least makes alot of their military weapons... i am sure... MAF would almost gauranteed to run out of war material before TNI does...</div>
