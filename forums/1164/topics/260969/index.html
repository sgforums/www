U need to have a very strong reason or able to surpass their internal conflicts by force to start a war. By judging from Indonesia political situation, the chance for Indonesia to attack Singapore is much much higher than Malaysia.<br>And to elaborate further, Singapore is doing well among south east asia. If Singapore is arrogant, the people of Indonesia will not even mind invading Signapore. To them, Singapore is just a red dot.<br>While Malaysia is an islamic country, if Indonesia do declare war on Malaysia, their people will mind...<br><br>So whether there is a war among malaysia, singapore and indonesia, the chance is very very small. Because, Singapore is worthless to be invaded in the eyes of a strategist.</div>
