            <div class='col-md body'>Lol !!! Did you spill your milk or something? I do not know what to say with the gibberish you have written up there. But I will try. Just for you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I think you really have a chip on your shoulder with any negative things about Malaysia. I do not know how much clear I could have possibly have been up there. But hey, at least I wrote in English. Try and use a program which helps in making your post more intelligible please.<br><br>Now let`s see if i can make sense of the mess you have made;<br><br><blockquote>you know. I am too tired now to response, but I don't really think i need to anyway</blockquote>Not if you have got nothing to say but apparently you do with the long response you have crafted.lol<br><br><blockquote>You're argument of Yugoslavia compared to Kuwait is plainly weak. There are much more then just a 'mere' comparison made. Probably you forgot the importance of oil and other regional importance, but hey - as long you're happy hey go for it. </blockquote>Obviously, you have missed my `obvious' point. lol.And I think you have just answered yourself as well. Lol. Why would Singapore help if it is not important to us ?  Duh. Why would any country? Duh<br><br><blockquote>No. obviously Singapore is not obligated in anyway to assist and I don't think anyone in the forum did say that singapore will definitely assist blindly. IN whichever way that both for and against avocated their views surely reflects a differing view point on the issue. </blockquote>Yes. So what about it? Some of the points were rehashed again and again in this thread. Or are you just so insistent that we save your arses that you are keep underlining the matter.<br><br><blockquote>However by saying Singapore is anything but stupid but to assist or somewhat similar in between those lines really questions to what extent your sophistication of language actually truly reflects your analysis. Obviously there is no one true right or wrong, but by saying it is definitely wrong surely reflects something more. Your reasoning are uncalled for, stupid, and anything less then objective. I would not even think it is nationalistic. Maybe some Malaysian stepped on your toes before I recon. Who knows. </blockquote>What are you blabbering about now? If you have bothered to up the ante with respect to comprehension, you would realize that what I am saying(but hey I wrote it up there plainly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) is that intervention is situational. I never said it would be stupid to assist. But perhaps you are somewhat put off about the dissolving Malaysia part.  That is pluasible even for Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Arthas79, fine 'realistically' Singapore might return to manufacturing, I would keep an open mind to this suggestion of yours but please do enlighten me with your reasonings, well offhead agaist popular understanding of 'the 3rd world' labour and of course China. Dumbdown your sophistication of language and please elaborate further "If it serves our interest to see Malaysia dissolve and we have delivered humanitarian aid to the civilian population, we would have already done a great service." Justify your claims. </blockquote>Lol. In the near future, many things will be crystalline based. Chips and even the humble mother-board. Everything. The few states which have such technology and skilled labour to make them are the US and Japan. Now, a few years later the Asian Tigers like Singapore and Korea started to make them in large numbers and become manufacturing giants in thier own right. Meanwhile, 3rd world countries would take a longer time to develop the pre-requisite knowledge base and human capital to make these crystals. They would end up doing low end manufacturing like toilet bowls.<br><br>Urm..about the justifying claims part..not too sure what to say. I never made any claim in the first place. Lol ! Basically, if we do not want to militarily intervene and silently oblige the end of Malaysia,  it would be kind of us to send humanitarian aid like food, medicine, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> At least your stomachs will be full and you still see the light of day right ?

            <div class='col-md body'>forget it. I must admit that I am typing rubbish - too tired. I will try to response tomorrow if the day permits.<br><br>Oh ya, I really do mean it on the reading up on your literatures before you simply use the term.<br><br>To just end for the day before I further making a fool of myself, yes admittingly I am underlining on Singapore's role. First. simply because it was the topic matter of this thread. Duh.<br><br>Second, as much I am avocating MAF, I do not deny or hide my admiration toward SAF and believing it would play an important role in the event of this stimulated event. It would definately be stupid for me to deny the obvious.<br><br>p.s: I am still on because I know my entry sounds real stupid and was trying to ractify and make good sense out of it. But since you replied then I'll leave it as it is. I just kept typing to try to make something out of it, but I can see I achieved little. By the way, making a joke out of my errors is fine because i deserve it, but your arguments still remain VERY weak.<br><br>this is an edit: FYI.<br>Forget it. I give up on you. HAHA~ yea we need your humanitarian aids. It is so funny. Maybe we should make pop guns out of bamboos and use the peas from Singapore aids if you gave any as ammo right? haha... oh ya i forgot, Singaporean hot air. Maybe thats a good airbomb. Bet it can kill someone with all the hot air...ha-ha.. Reminds me of "My daddy have.." and "Your mamas" crap we use to give each other in primary school to build an ego. Its is like a ha-ha so funny i cant stop laughing funny.<br><br>Maybe that's why arrogants and egoistic idoits like you reflect such badly on your nation. Tsk. What a pity.<br><br>------<br><br>We might never know we might return to manufacturing as a core sector because other countries do not have the acumen yet to manufacture the goods of the future. For the lay-person or worker on the street, it is a case of life-long employability and not employment.<br><br>3rd wld + China + manufacturing + economic of scale + human capital = Singapore going manufacturing. of course lots more to + ....I for one will go huh? What's your logic. Not explaining to me what is 3rd world and how they progress. Asian Tigers...hmm.... like i say again..... do more reading on your literatures. Do you know the very least things like China's sneeze to start with FOR EXAMPLE?</div>
