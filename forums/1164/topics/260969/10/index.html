            <div class='col-md body'>My two cents.<br><br>The RMAF simply lacks the "omph" needed to seriously deter a TNI invasion, assuming they manage to land as many dudes as possible on East Malaysia. The numbers simply don't add up.<br><br>And the IAF example raised by tankfanatic doesn't make too much sense when you consider that the IAF had many more planes to fight their wars with then the RMAF. Hence when it comes to attrittion, losing one aircraft to enemy fire or breakdown is far less of an issue with them then the RMAF.<br><br>Yes they can get jets into the air, but how much effect is another thing. You don't get the Yankee style of CAS where the grunts can mail order an airstrike in short order on priority targets, and in any case the RMAF simply can't get enough weapons airborne to make a serious dent on the ground effort, even if they did some crazy multiple land, grab bombs and take off sortie cycle.<br><br>Unless of course you buy the Iron Malayan argument that a couple of jets can hold off entire armies kind of thing, which I find highly dubious.<br><br>That said, if the TNI manages to land troops en masse there's going to be a serious fight and not some turkey shoot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting though by tripwire....<br><br>Its seems that TNI based on ur judgment is definitely superior in every term....<br><br>as i know currently Indonesian army have strength around 250 000 personnels....deployed across the whole country....i just need to know how long would they need to mobilized all the troops and transport them to Kalimantan? and how long do they need to train and mobilized another 100 000 soldiers and deployed them in Sumatra?....1 month? 2 month? 3 month?<br><br>and as u said before that peninsular Malaysia is in a way is included in FPDA where the area is where if threatened is agreed by all parties outside Malaysia to lend a hand in term of troops and material to threatened country......i think MAF can leave a skeleton army in Peninsular and moved....say.....another two division to the east.....leave the armor corp behind.....i got an oil palm estate and the terrain over there is useless for the heavy equipment.....faster for u to use the river then the road to get from point to point....if im not mistaken Malaysian Army have a strength of 100 000 personnels and  50 000 active reservist.....IF mind u i said IF.....we can detect hostility as TNI mobilizing we can also activate all our active reservist and also call all inactive personnels (ex-servicement, ROTU corps, ex-school military cadet, ect.) probably we can manage to raised more men for the coming struggle....exact number of how many troops that can be raised i dont know......but say we manage to raised 20 000.... and deployed them across western Peninsular Malaysia and leave the eastern and northern border to the Police Field Force.....that will basically put our strength in peninsular around 45 000 personnels.....i think that will be enough for us to put hell of a fight....<br><br>all rite u will probably argue why should the British, Australian, Kiwis, and Singaporean  come to our help in our time of distress by my argument is why not? they come last time....why they don't want to come now? but we never know until it happen....<br><br>but this is based on the idea that the battlefields are only in Borneo with the in mind that TNI dont want to activate the FPDA....if Indonesia launch a two pronged attack on both peninsular and east Malaysia is a different story all together......<br><br>anyway....i think they wont come.....if not they already here.....ill be expecting next morning to see the Jalur Gemilang still flying at my office building...not the Sang Saka Merah Putih.....<br><br>as i said before they tried before...they can try again.....if they really want</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TNI has lots of troops, but they are so scattered and organising them would be a dead give away. All the following points are just my thoughts:<br><br>1) The logistics needed for such a great amassment of troops would indeed be massive and none practical. Basic necessities like housing, food... etc. Even the arming of the troops and providing them with bullets will take up a massive cut from their defence budget.<br><br>2) Transportation would be a major headache. If I am not wrong, they do have some landing ships and probably not more than 30 C-130s? The nearest major military airbase capable of these kind of support is probably in Sumatra? The nearest commercial airport is in Batam. Our defenses would easily pick up any signs of activities (I hope). Any movement of their planes from Kalimantan or western Java would be a key indication for our guys to watch out.<br><br>3) Unless they are able to unit their people against Singapore, if not what they would be facing is a potential civil war within their country with the mass exodus of security troops to bases in Sumatra (within striking distance of Singapore).<br><br>4) If the attack fails, the government must be prepared for a major counter attack from Singapore, by then most of their airforce should be down. Singapore should concentrate on the key military installations, using air strikes.<br><br>But hopefully such a thing would not happen. Neither side will really win the war since Indonesia would (most probably) be thrown into anarchy and terrorism would be on the rise. It does not bode well for Singapore. The best is still peace.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Haha, just my silly half cent worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes when i read forum such as these I am totally amazed by the utter ignorance and self righteous sword wielding kids. Somehow I can't help but draw a conclusion that half of you are just noobs in military deployment and self rattling about superiority of SAF.<br><br>Yes i am a Malaysia and no doubt I will not second any opinion in Singapore's military standing  in the region in every terms Deployment, Logistic, Air superiority, Comm. &amp;Cont. etc.<br><br>However let me shed some light and put in some opinion of mine.<br><br>1: Yes FDPA is non-binding. And E Malaysia has no relevance to it. The reference given is Malaysia and I think someone did point out throughout this whole thread. Somewhere. Credit to that person. FDPA is timely relevance driven. Common sense.<br><br>2: Although some quarters do have reservation regarding Malaysian recent adhoc purchases leaning towards Russian-tech for better for worst was for many reasons<br>a: Russians are more tech transfer friendly, tho how it benefits Malaysia is a non-relevance to this topic<br>b: CHEAPER, within budget, I'm sure secondary accounting class taught most of you at least a little about budgeting, or many life experience with the 50cents and 10cents in your pocket.<br>c: We have bad experience with US. Due to 'reasons even beyond my logical thinking' we messed up the deal with our F18Ds. i am not sure if it is common practice of US, maybe some professional analyst can verify, the launch codes are held by US ie. Meaning we can't go around and go on any amok runs cause we have a expensive metal junk without launch codes ie. the planes.<br><br>3: Our Sukhois ASF, are highly maneuverable for whatever reasons we get it, yet again irrelevant to much extend to my point in this discussion and also it is flexi in its armaments and toys. Furthermore it can get to Labuan with moderate loading without refueling (need double confirmation on that). Shotgun prolly can talk a little more with much credit to him as well.<br><br>but my point is not all this. Whatever it is, the fact that any wars were to break out will definitely no doubt mess up the whole region BOP. Balance of power FYI and anyone say otherwise is a simple moron. ditto. The fact that if we all take a stop and look into US doctrine throughout world deployments tells us one thing. They one way or another will get involved, one way or another, big or small, willing or unwilling. Well for Singapore BAD LUCK. You can't sit tight and definitely need to do alot of deployment, least to secure borders. Even in mist of neutrality, Singapore will be hosting heavy US presence bla bla bla you got my point there. Singapore WILL feel the effects of the war as you know You have every good reason to brag about your economic strength and well i remembered someone did mention your biggest strength is your weakness in a difference context, but still the fact is you will be hit hard economically. You WILL want a swift war IF the floodgate was to break. You will be inclined to pick sides. How your leaders will maneuver around it another day's story. Psstt.. let me enlighten you with a little hint. One of the worlds most populated nations going to war? Hello? US will not sit on it neither the world will. Well however i must admit one thing - is that I doubt how effective in immediate terms UN will be. Its plague by internal politics and bad policies.<br><br>Malaysian army is not as weak as you think. Comparison or relativity. Indo could simply deploy 10 brigades through Kalimantan if they are stupid enough to start with. But someone again did drop a good point. No one will be stupid enough NOT to notice the troops movements.  If no one did, well what can i say - we deserve it. Alarm bells would be ringing. Para Brigade will be instantly deployed to supplement 1st division along with smaller movements.  West Coast defenses would be increase, Brunei will not sit on her warm ass you know, and Aussie and Kiwi also. Not to mention Singapore being a 'small red dot' as someone had put it will neither do that.<br><br>The fact is singapore would not be able to sustain without the existence of Malaysia. A simply fact. Oh ya, bare in mind thats provided the rest of the world sit with their arms folded. Whoever they are. Within 48 hours, if all plays up well East Malaysia easily would be a 'killing ground' but honestly ill prefer to think as a logging ground. More trees then human anyway. The simple fact is that whatever war it would be it will not be one-on-one so chew on that for let it sink in.<br><br>Indonesia being so fragmented will face security issues should their army be spread too thin. Common sense again. And it also tells us simply any large concentration of force in any one particular area weakens another. A stupid move that i think 200mil brains would at least figure that out, and I dont like it how you all be such a racist and call em Muslim. Not that I am one but hey, stop being a racist P*g. Colors of skin probably sparked half the worlds killing.<br><br>And well in regards to the girls photo, be ignorant and shout all the racist remark you want and gloat about it. If it was your wife/sister/child/grands on the table i get you it will be a different story. So learn some humility.<br><br>History taught us that wars are something we can really do without so learn how to admit it and put words out of your mouth with some responsibility on ur part. Ignorant is bliss, need i talk about stupidity, at its finest? In scenarios such as this is not my gun is bigger or my men is more. If you truly understand the totality of war then you SHOULD i pray understand the reciprocal effects it would have throughout the whole region.<br><br>P.S for you Singaporean out there. Yes we might not be as advance then you guys. A fact. Not going to argue on that, but know this, whoever you are up against will not go down without a fight and well you and I know SAF will not be able to pull off any occupational force and well your forward defense doctrine says exactly that. no doubt UN will need to step in if you do. However, if you attack, your future defense look awfully bleak in National Security. And of course whichever nation that attacks Singapore will likely pay a hefty economical sanction from all over the world. Wars are no longer only fought in conventional means with gunpowder and machines. Economical force is also another, East Asia is a good example how it is played out.<br><br>However, putting this views into a box, the plus and minus i can think of is that Msia and Indo are very much less economical dependant IN COMPARISON to Singapore in relative terms. We would be able to stonewall a economic crisis longer in the SHORTTERM then Singapore BEFORE freefalling, while Singapore will Freefall first before instantly bouce back in a jiff. On another point is that it would be stupid for Singapore to make second move - instead of first for obvious reasons.<br><br>TNI and RAF airforce is comparable but we have an advantage of less airspace.<br><br>This is just my two cents to this whole thread. I'm sick and tired how other people nation bash another standing on a pedestal of ignorance.<br><br>Just keep in mind, any war to break out will not end in one generation so suck on that for the meantime and think. you can't evaluate any war as if they fight i sit i no lose they all lose - ie i win.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. <strong>your figures are wrong.. for eg... MAF army current standing force is 80,000 and TNI army strength not including the marines stands at 285,000.</strong><br><br>Its approx 90,000 in battle order minus support elements.<br><br>2. you wanna raise 20,000 extra forces? take a look at indonesia's population.. and tell me if you think they could raise even more soldiers within the same period of time... especially given their much bigger defence industries vis-a-vis malaysia's...<br><strong>valid point. We are screwed in that sense.</strong><br><br>3. number wise.. malaysia dont stand a chance... so.. you can actually stop giving us any more figures.<br><strong>As above, but same goes to singapore.</strong><br><br>4. strategically.. your plan needs the FPDA support... but as you know.. its not absolute.. and very often it depends alot on the spot political climate. for eg.. the brits are now heavily involved in IRAQ and AFGAN, plus terrorism at home... i doubt they are interested in getting into a war halfway round the world against a big (though not advance equipped) military.<br><strong>True. But I prefer to think otherwise. Wars do not conviniently happens and same goes to participating in wars. Well a war will definately mess up oil prices the least i can think off head. something would likely happen, its impact another story. But point taken</strong><br><br>australia lacks the number and new zealand dont even have an air force... who else is left to guard your house while you go hunting in east malaysia?? Mr. Green Mr. Green Mr. Green<br><strong>Is it just me or E Malaysia is the unlikely MAIN THEATER? But well thats where Brunei and allies come into picture, but yea~ i admit.. I am not 100% sure of it...just READ above. I doubt it would be in a large scale invasion in  East Malaysia, most likely targeted key location invasion, something very much isolated by size, easily taken and would also mean 'possibly' easily re-taken. Moreover, wars now are much faster. Its Military illogical to defend the whole Kalimantan Border what else face2face engagement.</strong><br><br>given malaysia's politicians constant anti-singapore attitude and countless effort to undermine singapore's economy as well as security... i doubt there will be much support in singapore to rescue someone who has been shouting potong potong across the causeway ever so often.... and trying to steal our island!!!<br><strong>Come on, be honest, if Malaysia is losing Singapore will be peeing in her pants as well. Imagine the changes is regional politics and your neighbours. Even Aust armaments has alot to do with its proximity with Indonesia, and if your claims of race, skin colour is true, well you're contradicting yourself by acting high and mighty.</strong><br><br>in fact.. i counted at least twice, SAF nearly invade malaysia and LKY once threaten to invade malaysia to defend singapore's interest... given the background... i doubt UMNO leaders would sleep well with singapore soldiers guarding their door... Twisted Evil Twisted Evil Twisted Evil<br><strong>Water issue. A silly saga but essential in strategic importance wise. Admit. </strong> psst.. for you gloats out there, if we are so 'noob' as you think we are, well you better pray hard that in your FANTASY of a 'successful' campaign, no missiles accidentally pass thru your defence net, cause for every one of it, its a building block the very least. I'm not comparing guns, just sharing some humility not to wear a hat bigger then your head, cause it will simply block your sight.<br><br>5. why should singapore get in trouble with indonesia over east malaysia? it doesnt matter how we get involved.. TNI generals aint stupid... any effort on singapore part to assit MAF in any form or manner would be regarded the same as RSAF dropping a bomb in jakarta... so.. lets not kid ourselves by reading in-between the lines...<br><strong>True, but by not helping, one way or another Singapore will be crucified in the long run. Something cross my mind... refugees...lol.. its silly but imagine the 'swim-overs'...</strong><br><br>6. how you gonna get MAF from west malaysia to east malaysia? across indonesia territorial water or around natuna island??? either way... i doubt TNI will be amused... and do nothing to hinder or stop it.<br><strong>Point taken, but it will be a long run logistical problem, on the immidiate term this is not relevant. Deployment would be made as TNI showing aggression</strong><br><br>7. moving MAF soldier to east malaysia is the easy part... logistical support to sustain and supply the additional forces would require substantial sealift and airlift capabilities... across or detour around indonesian territorial water and air space.... not easy leh.<br><strong>true no buts here. I guess this is a weak point the MAF is trying to solve</strong><br><br>btw..sorry for the bad english, noticed many grammer errors and bad phrasing. Kinda rush through this without proof reading . As long as you can understand, that is what that matters. Yet again, my apologies</div>
