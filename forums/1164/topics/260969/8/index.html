After the birth of the federation of malaysia, indonesia see singapore and malaysia as enemy.<br><br>2. As a new independant elected nation, they ask for help from friendly nation to stop the agression of indonesia as both singapore and malaysia didnt have a strong army yet.<br><br>3. Help came from United kindom and its friend.<br><br>4. Both army were re equip with better weapon and training by these nation under the AMDA, also commonwealth army came in the defence of both country to delay if not stop the agression of indonesia.<br><br>5. bla bla...long story short the agression stop... but the hate and lust remain in the heart of the indonesian leader.(the propaganda didnt stop with the confrontation as right now indonesian leader were in the defensive mode and mobilising its propaganda machine to justified its action in malaysia and to save face)<br><br>6. Un easy peace  were in effect, yet the AMDA felt that it is emparative to keep that peace with an assurance, so the FPDA were born for just that.<br><br>7. But there is a catch, the 5 nation felt that the agression of indonesia will not last long, because sooner or later all have to work together for the benefit of all.<br><br>8. From time to time the agreement were changed so that it would not be a total concept. hence...<br><blockquote>The Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) were agreed in 1971 and committed Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and UK to <strong>consult</strong> in the event of an attack on Singapore or Malaysia.</blockquote>9. While the tone were soften... these 5 country still regularly exercise with each other in an unforseen event of an attack by an 'unknown' enemy. They have a Headquarters of the Integrated Area Defence System. The australia stationed troops and ac in butterworth and the IADS itself were upgraded from time to time.<br><br>10. The number of exercise increase even adding annual naval and land exercise.<br><br>the 5 nation really seriously consulting each other allright...especially when the flame inside the heart of indonesian politian still burning after all the years of peace.<br><br><blockquote>after 8 years of negotiation... i am sorry to inform you... east malaysia was eventually dropped from the FPDA.<br><br>here is a short excerpt from singapore MINDEF journal... and i quote:<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The very fact of its flexible arrangement means that any member who has become "less willing" can leave the FPDA, thus weakening both the indivisible defence of. peninsular Malaysia and Singapore element and the so-called psychological deterrence element. Conceivably, a more assertive Indonesia may in future raise questions about the FPDA's relevance.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</blockquote>look pal, its a journal...a journal could be wrong..back in the 60 &amp; 70 some people still call the peninsular malaysia as malaya and thought the sabah and sarawak belongs to the british... its like when some people still think that malaysian still live in cave. For all the thing that we said it is a typo or flawed research.<br><br>you can use that as your argument but everywhere else in the whole wide world it was written and even acknowledged that the the FPDA were tailored to defend MALAYSIA (as of the entire malaysia...because there were no such thing as East malaysia nor west malaysia, they were called that for the sake of geographical name ) and SINGAPORE from external agression.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by tripwire:<br><br><blockquote>such arrogance... from singaporean as well as malaysian forumners... </blockquote><strong>It's not a matter of just pure numbers. Quantity (and quality as well) makes the difference.</strong><blockquote>allow me to say this... until each and every one of those ships i listed is confirmed sunk... in war.. one must assume the worst... and consider every indonesian ship as sea worthy... and more then capable of doing its duties...<br>[quote]to simply look down on the prepardness, willingness and readiness of the indonesian military professionalism to ready every vessel at its command prior to a war... is gonna be our biggest mistake.<br>even if 80% of the indonesian transport fleet is down for maintainance or other reason... that is still a military lift capability on par with RSN and definitely superior to RMN..</blockquote><strong>It doesnt matter if it has a working sea-lift capability of MORE than RMN/RSN.<br>It's a matter of Logistics. You can lift troops, you cant lift supplies. You can lift supplies, you cant lift reinforcements.  Sea-Lifting takes alot more time to move than say Air-lift.  The longer your troops are at Sea, the higher risk of them getting seasick/lack of rest/sanitation/overcrowding.<br>In other words their fighting condition by the time them disembark will be lowered most definitely. Their vunerability also increases the longer they are in the ocean.  the TNI will have to deploy sufficient Naval AND Aerial Cover 24/7 to protect this convoy until arrival?  (Which you did not seem to have addressed in my previous post)<br>Even 100 U-100s wont stop a Harpoon/Exocet or KH-59 from blowing the Transport to bits.</strong><br><blockquote>while i dont think that TNI-AL would actually use those ships in the melaka straits due to geographical reason... i believe that TNI-AL can support a troop rush to kalimantan from every province of indonesia faster then malaysia can to support east malaysia.</blockquote><strong>Yes you would need it in fact.  Travel by sea takes time.  Travel from Coast to inland -objectives takes even more time as well. Travel by land to inland objectives takes alot of time. In other words, you give Defending forces in East Malaysia plenty of time to prepare defense positions.  The longer the time they have to prepare defensive positions, the MORE men you need to assualt those objectives you have to take.  Also to mention, this is most likely(At most) A light mech aggressor attacking dug-in defensive positions with Artillery Support.  It's pretty foolhardy in my honest opinion.</strong><br><blockquote>not mention the fact that the huge sea lift amphi capabilites would allow indonesia to open and support a second beach front along east malaysia coast to the north and stretch the already overstretch MAF into a bi-front war with a simultaneous assault from across kalimantan.</blockquote><strong>As stated, even if you have a two-directional war, you being the aggressor -must be able to coordinate movement of troops at sea and on land (because they travel at VERY different speeds) so time  planning is a factor to be able to capture your objectives at the same time.  Otherwise, your attack will be most likely fail. Moreover, if Indonesia is the aggressor, you have to -attack- your targets. Regardless of how much troops you have, you have to use them to attack - defending positions chosen by Malaysians/well stocked and supplied to let you grind your troops against them. No point telling me you can take CTE/PIE OR just TPE from Yishun to Changi.  Even if you come from two directions, you will have to take over Changi right?  That's the challenge.</strong><br><blockquote>lastly... i am short of time... allow me to say this... fence sitting is not an option for singapore on the long term.<br>and neither would making indonesia our enemy a best outcome scenario...</blockquote><strong>Yes to not fence sitting but going all out to not offend indonesia is pretty stupid</strong><br><blockquote>in my opinion... we cannot afford to offend indonesia... as such... we risk making malaysian an enemy... something we cannot afford too... </blockquote><strong>No. As in. I rather we offend the first than betray a close relative.</strong><br><blockquote>what we can do within our ability is to wipe MAF off the floor and try to seek peace with indonesia...  (unless some genius here can tell us how we can wipe the TNI off the map with our limited resources... with or without MAF assitance)</blockquote><strong>If we dont have to do the first thing you mentioned here, we have more than enough resources to be able to deter any threats from the latter.  I would be even more interested to hear what you say regarding Indonesia's ability to attack us with their military might.  Please nothing like insurgents/commando wrecking havoc. If that happens, that's a BIG international boo boo once we capture those people and put them on TV. Remember the macdonald house ka-boom?</strong><br><blockquote>the good news is... global powers will not want to see an indonesian domination of the melaka strait.. that could work in our advantage.</blockquote><strong>Of course can you believe, their multi trillion dollar investments becoming smoke over night and they will just allow that?</strong></div>

Normal defence odds are 3:1.  Dug in with arty support can increase to 7:1 or more.  The more of troops/supplies/armour/arty/fuel/ammunition you bring.. the less of the previously mentioned other 5 options you have.<br><br>2)Troops condition will -drop- the longer they are at sea. They will not be in 100% fighting condition should they have to take a sea-lift then onto a few days trek  inland to their objectives.<br><br>3) Time coordination between a coastal assault and a land assault must be well coordinated to maximise Firepower else it will might as well be two seperate weaker attacks.<br><br>4) I was also clearly stating the usage of TNI-AL sealift at kalimantan - what do you have to protect the LSTs from intrusions of RMN/RSN, RMAF/RSAF units from deploying weapon systems against them.<br><br>5) LSTs being used inland doesnt mean it's well "within TNI-AU protection and well beyond RMAF reach" How would you deal with a strike package of F-18s carrying harpoons escorted with a Mig-29s in interceptor role maybe even guided by a E2-C somewhere? &lt;--Consider this is only a RMAF senario.<br><br>A worse senario will be that of a screen of F-18s &amp; Mig 29s in interceptor role....followed by a strike package of F-16Ds with close escorts of F-16Cs in fighter/attack arming. The entire movement coordinated by E2-Cs and the F-16s can carry a full-load package due to the tanker hovering in the South China Sea.....That will freaking hurt.</div>
