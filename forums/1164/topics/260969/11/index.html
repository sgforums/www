Is it me or did someone not pay any attention? Moreover If I remembered well was someone else that started it, and it was some  Hokkien-talking Singaporean ( sorry to pick on you) and chino65.<br><br>----<br><br>Well yes, what can I say? Our NS is social work and I am not shy to admit its stupidity. It started out positively only to come to this stage due to children-loving parents and weak governmental commitments.<br><br>Well, hey you know, don't need to use sophisicated english if you can't figure outthe difference between a poser and a poster. It relly got me cracking! but then maybe you do have a good point if you meant poser.<br><br>You see, the difference between a constructive critical evaluation and ego building is the difference between good post like the many here and entries below. I mean hey, if you want a good discussion then moderate the topic and steer it in a right direction. Moreover, by saying nothing you are actually condoning to the thoughts.<br><br>crusader91:<br>I agree.East malaysia is backward filled with 'cavemen'<br><br>Arthas79:<br>Anyhow, we should come in and help negotiate a peace treaty between the two. And yes, we should take a slice of Malaysia as well at that point of time. Afterall, we all know(and the Malaysians too(chuckles)) that Singapore would make thier country a better place than what it is today.<br><br>FG42:<br>i rather trust the malaysians then the indonesian savages!<br><br>SpecOps87<br>And with both M'sia and Indonesia being pre-dominantly Muslim countries...I seriously hope that PMP produces enough ammo of 5.56mm and 7.62mm man.<br><br>-----<br><br>Well if it help your ego to say i know something and you dont helps. Good for you mate! Live on and suck it up. The fact is that we do not go around and bash other nations. Its pure ignorance if you think of it. I know my country more then you know yours so it is only right for me to say mine is great and your third world country sucks. Well of course Malaysia is not better then Singapore, known fact - so you dont really have to keep point it out.<br><br>My whole point is discussion can do without the racist remarks and nation bashing. If it was about TNI and MAF then just compare that both - you dont go say bla bla bla... but you know, SAF still better then both. It is as if you are so insecure that you need to slip such statement in everytime to feed your ego. P.s i meant 'you' as in a general referance. not Typhoon in any way.<br><br>No goin to start a flame war here, but I hope you do know the difference in evaluating a military force is difference between combat proven and not combat proven, which TNI and MAF are and i highly doubt 'the occassion soldiers' of SAF and you held so tightly as your point of reference are.<br><br>Yes...we are fantastic, but who knows. I don't - therefore i don't go say Singaporean infantry suck now right. In any engagement in any kind the difference between life and death is a split second and the risk of death are as high both sides only to be determined by weapons and other variables. What I am trying to say? Well you can hold a m16 and spray all around, but it takes 1 accurate shot of blowpipe to take you down permanently. And this goes to even for the pro-MAF humans.<br><br>Psst.. I did not say MAF will trash TNI - that you drew a bias conclusion yourself in defending you beloved SF. Good for you for that. BUT I am saying that no one will be stupid enough to commit to a full scale campaign without factoring the impacts it would have to the region and how the rest of the world would react to her agressions.<br><br>...........................<br><br>For one last time I do not think MAF will pawn TNI, i rather am inclined to think otherwise in a prolonged battle. I am saying Singapore will be stuck in the crossfire. I am saying the agressor will be punished serverely by global citizens whoever it was. I am saying Singapore hardware is the leader within the region. I am saying that its ignorant to discredit both the capabilities of TNI and MAF. In my view, a desprate army is the scariest army. Look at Russia in WWII, it might be stupid in modern thoughts, but marching through landmines is something demoralizing to the opponent. East Asian being the second most unstable region with N. Korea being so unpredicted, the more unpredicted an army is -  the most reason to fear because they operate with a totally different M.O.<br><br>Btw 2 years of NS means nothing until you have a blood baptism, and even then even the strongest and the toughest could break mentally. That saying goes to everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the replies and insight Tripwire. It was just a little distasteful how some members in the forum uses race, religion and colour as their main perspective in basing their statements. Cheap shot.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">actually if you check the latest figures from the military balance, malaysia army is quoted at 80,000 including all support elements and this figure will be further reduced to 60,000-70,000.<br><br>while its stated at the same time... that indonesia has about 400,000 reserves.<br><br>so... in a number game... i think we all knows who is the winner.<br><br></div></blockquote>I must admit there are alot of confusion regarding MAF composition, no doubt there is a reduction in MAF active forces. You are right in the facts. According to IISS, MAF stood at 80,000 active personels. I mistakenly took the figure of 110,000 - MAF +MRN +MRAF. My bad. Apologies!<br><br>Indonesia have 233,000 active as of 2006 according to the same report. No information of reserves.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">singapore do not face the same geographical situation as east malaysia... and being given our sensitive geostrategical location and considerable distance from even the nearest indonesian island...<br><br>the comparison of numerical difference between singapore and indonesia is of little value... unless indonesia can overcome the inherent physical and geopolitical obstacles.. which east malaysia do not enjoy.<br><br></div></blockquote>Agreed. This is a fact. There is little evidence that presumably any military figures would be of any relevance - which bring me back to my point, 3. number wise.. malaysia dont stand a chance.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tripwire:</div><div class="quote_body">east malaysia is the main theater of a TNI and MAF war... due to tactical and strategic reasons.<br><br>the last thing brunei wants is a war on its land... its my opinion that brunei would rather seek a peace deal with indonesia through singapore, with the backing of england and by extension... america.<br><br>and the last thing indonesia wants... is help malaysia garner allies against TNI... thus a peace accord between indonesia and brunei, and by extension with singapore, british, america, thailand and philippine would serve to isolate malaysia and consolidate indonesia hold on occupied east malaysia.<br><br></div></blockquote>Tripwire, can you please shed some light and elaborate a little bit more on your views on this part of your discussion? I agrees Brunei would probably do so, unless I can't think of what reason for them to be pro-malaysia anyway.<br><br>It is just my opinion which I hope we can engage in, although it is true that E Malaysia theater would provide much of 'smart tactital and strategic' reasons. E Malaysia is a good as a resource denial strategy and staging ground for whoever that controls it.<br><br>I can roughly understand where you are coming from, but I really can't see any reason it to be a MAIN theater, strategic and tactical, yes.<br><br>In my oppinion there is little or doubtiously a waste (figure of speech) for Malaysia to even try to defend E Malaysia should it be the MAIN theater. The borders are long, over 1,500km if I am not wrong and any attempt is just not-going-to-happen. It would make more sense to fight and scoot from E Malaysia once it loses any strategic value ie airbases etc. and resolve to hit and run tactics (arguable) and gerilla tactics.<br><br>It would be a close fight on MAF on the losing end considering both sides would be well acustomed to jungle warfare. In view of MAF, we will not be able to sustain constant supply lines considering geo and hardware issues and even with the organic SAC to be deploy from W to E Malaysia, I highly doubt it makes any huge difference anyway. The movement seemed irrelevant to TNI onslaught - probably only a fortification and deterance movement.<br><br>In any senario of war, E Malaysia is a valid first move from TNI and deterance to buy time for MAF side. Any larger engagement would likely only take place after this scenario plays off itself. and would likely spins around after E Malaysia taken and focuses on West Malaysia. It is just hard for me to think of any reason for Malaysia to even commit its conventional army in E Malaysia in liue of logistical issues. In the strategic argument, frequent small isolated engagement would be more likely.<br><br>What I mean by wars plays off more quickly was that even with resource denial I am doubtious how far it would actually impact Malaysia in short run. Staging ground for air harassment by TNI into W Malaysia would be more likely in the shortrun. However long term as a bargaining chip i would not deny its possibility.<br><br>HOWEVER, I say all these given a senario of a 1 to 1 war which is highly unlikely. I would say deterance through political channels or economical sanction would kill any likelyhood of mass deployment by TNI. I know I know irrelevant to this discussion.<br><br>...<br><br>Coming back<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tripwire:<br>[b]<br><br>singapore would be concerned, but i doubt we will be peeing in our pants... decades of defence and diplomacy building has given us a reasonable level of confidence in our ability defend our interest.<br><br>nobody gonna invade australia... and by extension mess with the USA... but its doubtful.. that australia would invade indonesia given its current military numbers to save a less then friendly, non strategic piece of foreign land on the other side of the indonesian achiepelego. [b]</blockquote>First off, sorry for my Market/ crude use of english. Its a bad use of figure of speech. Yes I do agree with every point you made in this statement.<br><br>Brings us back into our initial question, which side would Singapore side. Any open military support by whichever nation proximate to Indonesia would be disasterous for the future at the same time the whole idea being surrounded by Indonesia should Malaysia falls into the hand of Indonesia is nothing less then alarming. What is your view in this? Lets just say if Singapore have to pick one or stay neutral, who, why and how. A simplistic approach.<br><br>Australia would unlikely be involve in this conflict should the lid blows over. Maybe before as mediator and after as peacekeepers. Not in mist. They have neither the numbers to do that and it would be bad for their future homeland security taking into account their recent movement away from 'reminisance of motherland' to their newfound ally, the United States. I agree.<br><br>It will take a bigger country to put an end to the Indonesia agression or as how some history plays out the world folds her arms and wait till someone loses before steping in to rebuid it. UN will likely play any role in the conflict. Effects from the rest of the world would likely only be felt after the whole thing cools down. not before.<br><br>BTW I did not mention anything about invading Australia.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tripwire:<br>[b]<br><br>the SAF is not as naive as you, we dont hallucinate like you do..... in a war... we expects large number of casualties..civilian and military...<br><br>even against larger foes, we intend to fight and inflict even more casualites on our enemies and win the war... and I'm not comparing guns either.... though we practically win in almost every weapon category from fighters, stealth frigate to MBTs against MAF.... just some humility.<br>[b]</blockquote>Sorry for this part. It was a flaming statement I made to those statements made throughout the post that gloated about how incompetant MAF is. By comparing hardware, we are more inferior but by active soldier we are definately on par. We do not walk into a firing machinegun. Its an outright intelect insult. Not that I am a pro-MAF, but hey give em a break.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by tripwire:<br>[b]<br><br>only if the war spreads to west malaysia.. which i have pointed out repeatedly... the low probability of that happening due to several consideration... not least the might of the SAF.. and the limitations of the TNI.<br>[b]</blockquote>Please do elaborate on the several consideration if you may <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>IMHO The war would definately spread to W Malaysia. But if i read your words right, in your oppinion, SAF would step in - which kind of invalidate any discussion of W Malaysia. True.<br><br>I do not quite follow your discussion to be honest, IMHO its a simple as - if SAF assist MAF, then the main theater yes would be E Malaysia, if no outside assistance the likelihood, it only logical MAF would concerntrate on W Malaysia defences. And hence which brings me back to the main theater being W Malaysia. even you agrees that there is no point to fight in E Malaysia if supply line is unsustainable. But the main theater is in E Malaysia...so whats what? It will take two sides to have a war<br><br>You mentioned that singapore would isolate malaysia and on another singapore would play a role in W Malaysia defences? There is a few more other points you contradict yourself, so please do clarify.<br><br>And no regional citizen would allow indonesia's occupancy of E Malaysia in the long term. If you are going to factor in regional pacting then you must also factor in everything else also. You can't just simply pcik and choose what you want to hear and discard the rest as irrelevant just because it doesnt support your argument.<br><br>Thanks for the insight!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As much as TNI has huge no. of soldiers, their logistical abilities are questionable at best. I do not think they can have the whole bloody lot fighting a war and hope to be able to continue supplying the army for too long. Not least, at the moment, they can barely run their fleet to police their own waters, let's not even talk about beach landings.<br><br>Borneo is the only feasible battleground available to them, and quite frankly, I doubt they will dare to invade Peninsular Malaysia without some sizable logistical capabilities which currently do not exist. More so, I am certain that the Brunei sultanate has a defence pact with us, and surely they will get entangled with the Indonesians if they so invade W. Malaysia. We will have little choice but to at the minimum station troops there as a sort of deterrent. Mobilisation of naval assets will definitely come in and God knows what happens next. Once the shooting starts, it is hard to pull back.<br><br>Personally, I question whether the Indonesians can even get involved in a war, given that there are diverse ethnicities, and some separatist leanings. Some groups might start rattling sabers should the TNI become overly weakened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CM06, nah its okay, the information is not exactly all accurate either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  just seeking some fellows to throw some points here and there and see if it cooks up any good corrections. Feel free if you like.<br><br>Thank you everyone for steering the discussion back to its course.<br><br>My sentiments on this issue of MAF vs TNI is relatively somewhat along these lines. First off I totally doubt this scenario would even take place considering their internal issues. But well letÂ’s just say it happens.<br><br>Surely neighboring country would compare and sought to be better then the other, itÂ’s normal. Albeit the recent years of squabbles about air intrusion and water issues - Malaysia have been relatively passive towards Singapore. We are good neighbor one way or another. A devil you know is better then the one you don't. I don't see any valid reason why Singapore would want to isolate Malaysia even in the context of self-preservation. It make no good sense. Isolating Malaysia would only bring future insecurities in the future - considering the possibility of it could even happen matters.<br><br>Modern world no longer have good long tolerance on any outright military occupation. Any condonation by any nations would be heavily criticized for destabilizing the region and would only cause political and foreign policies nightmare. I don't think good smart leaders that Singapore have would miss or downplay this point.<br><br>Singapore would definitely get stuck in the crossfire. Brunei on the other hard is hard to say - too little influence passive or active to change any course, likely they will try to lean more towards any coalition or neutral ground as much as possible.<br><br>It would be a matter of how much Singapore is willing to get involved. Passively relieving MAF in W Malaysia to concentrate on its Eastern front or altogether get involve in the defense of E Malaysia.<br><br>Any movement in TNI troops to Kalimantan would unlikely goes unnoticed to start with. Rapid MAF deterrence para deployment in E Malaysia would be likely in the scenario, followed by secondary ground troop deployment. SingaporeÂ’s BruneiÂ’s AustraliaÂ’s New ZealandÂ’s assistance would be bonuses. Even at this point, TNI in their right mind would be having second thoughts to go down this road.<br><br>In the event of a full scale all out attack, the only logical move for MAF to defense to a point where all strategic value is lost, retreat surviving forces to W Malaysia and abandon E Malaysia to nationalist (not a good way of putting it tho) and rangers to harass enemies lines while occasional strategic attacks. Hit and run precision bombing.<br><br>Yes E Malaysia would be easily lost and would give TNI a very good staging ground for any future assault, but pacifying remaining forces would be a pain and the likelihood any strategic value initially would be very well balanced off to the decrease of its value altogether. Reasons:-<br>1. MAF would have a smaller area to defend.<br>2. TNI forces would be scattered.<br>3. Constant harassments from hiding forces in E Malaysia.<br>4. E Malaysia has very little buildups and these are actually the strategic values when they started that would likely be rendered unusable by the time TNI secure these positions.<br>5. Resource denials have no immediate effect to MAF<br><br>W Malaysia fortification by then would be ready and condensed. By then Indonesians in Malaysia (you need to account for that) would be very much flushed out from the nation that could be a torn in mist of war. With the lost of E Malaysia, it will turn into a race to control the skies (Eastern Theater) and sea (Straits).<br><br>In terms of skies, it would be a fair fight, but Malaysia would have the upper hand as with the lost of E Malaysia there is virtually no existence of seafaring supply lines to maintain while Indonesia would have. In terms of sea, Southern hemisphere would unlikely have any major sea movement considering proximity to Singapore in the scenario of neutrality. South China Sea would be too vulnerable for TNI to launch any invasion forces. Too long in open sea and susceptible to weather and MAF scouts to detect. Invasion would likely be from Western Theater. By this time MAF would be entrenched. RMN would be providing support while RMAF keep TNI at bay at the Eastern front and provide air support in the west. Up until now lets just say TNI would be at least be already feeling war exhaustion. Even by now if world do not tame TNI, assuming any invasion was to happen, it would be somewhat hard but possible for TNI to launch a massive landing campaign or any airdrop to muster enough one kill punch towards MAF.<br><br>My point is I canÂ’t imagine it even reaching to this stage. I am just letting my imagination go wild. There is too many loopholes where the aggressor would and should give up. This has not yet even to take account of the worldÂ’s condemnation and involvement and economic lashbacks.<br><br>Not to mention even considering that the whole nation stands united for this cause and not seek any chance of defecting away. Internally would be a nightmare for Indonesia. They just are unable to sustain any role as an aggressor.<br></div>

In terms of strategic sense, engaging TNI in E Malaysia would provide time for Malaysia to call for defense aids as well and fortifying and force consolidating in W Malaysia ( I am literally saying W is more important then E, its a fact and you only got 2 to choose from, if 1 gets attack 2 gets time).<br><br>If we are to fight this war out of pride and ignorance then well we derserve evey single bit since we are outnumbered by 3 to 1 in regular army alone. Not to mention both sides are accustomed to jungle warfare and are deadly as they come by. It would be a fair game in human capital strength- the difference would be arms and toys as force multiplier. How much it is irregardless still do not justify going up against TNI upfront. I see a bleak future for MAF to commit any more troops then 'sufficient' or even to fight it the conventional style with brick and mortar.<br><br>In my view, it makes good strategic sense to let E Malaysia go eventually once all defense preparation is done. and sit on it and wait till either war exhaution, world intervention, internal uprising, TNI get outstretched, commitment of TNI forces elsewhere sets in and retake E Malaysia.<br><br>We all love the pineapples there - definately a luxury we will deny Indonesia from having.<br><br>Sometimes sacrifices have to be made and in this case it would be E Malaysia. It literally reduces MAF defence radius by half ~ and in logic sense doubles the effectiveness of the remaining half of the defense.</div>

But elaborating further. 3 to 1 ratio doctrine is just merely a guideline for 'common sense'. In real terms if LETS SAY mere example China decides to go on a border expansion, what do you do? Instantly drop your arms and give up if China am the aggressor and moreover Japan defies the doctrine as well by a near success in invading China. Tho I must say this is a bad example. You got the gist.<br><br>In reality this doctrine hold much less weights (not no weight) then when it was actually written.<br><br>Its a good guideline but my own take in it (everyone is entitled to their own opinion) that this doctrine mainly applies to isolated engagement probably at best up to company level engagement in today's time. Rarely do you see anymore WWII like armies where you have hundreds of divisions. I mean really, if you have an army of millions like the soviets have - sending your army as marching minesweepers is another's day story - sorry keep bringing this up - just utterly shocking to know it actually happened[/b][/quote]<br><br>Separate issue, if we look closely at MAF deployments, it make good sense that a high concentration of force lies in the center of W Malaysia, nearer to Northern Thai border. This would provide speedy deployment to its Northern border (choke point anyway) in any scenario of ThaiÂ’s aggression. Singapore would be another story. The war would definitely no second doubt be on Malaysia soil. MAF would probably have no choice but to sacrifice Johor and part of Pahang while hold a defensive parameter along Pahang and Negeri sembilan. Not going to go there.<br><br>Back to the topic  in case of TNI aggression and our geographical layout, it provides us with good and rapid deployment ability to secure both seafronts with little problem in logistical shifting of troops between the two land fronts.<br><br>Moreover looking into recent MalaysiaÂ’s purchases, along its vision statement (cant remember where I read it, something like 1992-1994 consolidate army then bla bla bla to 2020) there seems to be a thrust for better airlift and support elements. Cut this short, YES MAF is looking to boost security for E Malaysia.<br><br>Even many people have thier oppinion for the recent Aug to Carbine as a standard issue rifle, Yes i share all the same sentiments with most of you out there, for it be bad decision or the license issue.. but the only logical thing i can think of putting myself into their head (INITIAL INTENTIONS) is its use for jungle warfare. Shorter barrel to improve short range capabilities.............. cough...but how well the rifle will survive in MAF regular's hand is another story altogether not yet factoring in the environmental factors.<br><br>What I am going on and on is it unlikely E Malaysia is forgoten altogether.<br></div>

I wrote up quite a long reply but an error erased everything, so ill make this short. Hope it convey everything else ill do so as your replies.<br><br>In terms of E Malaysia to W Malaysia, yes it had contributed alot and no doubt they have the smallest size for good reasons. There is no logic to develop E Malaysia!<br><br>W Malaysia and even taking into singapore in as illustration, the only way i can see how you justify money allocation or richness is by economical and financial richness in which with the same money spend on W Malaysia compared to E Malaysia for example road repairs makes no logic sense. NOT saying we shouldnt invest alright but in an adequate manner. You give the 2 state lets say 40% of the fiscal budget because they contribute 70% to the total renevue last year, do it make any economical sense?<br><br>but yes, there is certain unfairness to this whole sentiments but factoring in the complexity of cultures and aboriginals along with its vast forested lands, and head counts. It make no valid sense to build up just for the sake cause they contributed much. It simply economy sense - for the majority benefit.<br><br>I drawing a bias remark saying this but Singapore is small, certainly distribution of equality in terms of infrastructure is not an issue. But with a country that is vastly divided between a sea, its a totally another ballgame and your fundementals that you generate your views cannot apply in this case.<br><br>Bigger countries have problems with distribution simply because it is the way it is. It is ALWAYS for the majorities benefits' for whatever reasons political, common sense , economical whatever the reason is. Money distribution is never distributed by how much you contribute. YES too little money is given, but it should not be compared in a sense they gave X amount therefore they are entitled x% of it.<br><br>Awareness of E Malaysian needs is definately something to keep poking on since it is a blunder of conflicting needs, but saying that W Malaysia is canibalising E Malaysia and E Malaysia made the better bad choice (MAS not INDO) in joining the Malaysian Alliance is simply unjustified. Its a blunder that can be corrected and not a mistake made.<br><br>And they are richer then you think they are. there are large communities of E Malaysian in AU and UK. All doing very well and funded very well, but of course it is never a complete answer - there are always place for improvements.<br><br>Well you are generally not wrong in your views, but the way you generate your views are wrong in my oppinion.<br><br>Even if singapore controls E Malaysia, the development and robustness will never be on par for obvious reasons. Spending 50mil on road maintainance in E Malaysia could pay for Singapore for 2 years.<br><br>BUT yes being the least budgeted is definately something worth noting.<br><br>BTW if malaysian deforest vast area for development NGO and world green communities would heavily critisized the move. And they way they are is te best - generating profits. You dont go messing around with 5 star cash cows just because you think it can perform better being different right?<br><br>W Malaysia is definately profiting from E Malaysia, but it is simply the way it is. I don't get the big fuss out of it. Looking on a bigger picture, romania joining EU..who benefited? do give a few minutes on it.<br><br></div>
