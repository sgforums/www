            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I think that any conflict between Malaysia and Indon would be largely restricted in the bordering lands of East Malaysia.  And I doubt they would be allowed to escalate beyond border skirmishes.<br><br>In the event of an escalated war, I think SG's leaders aren't so myopic to side with M'sia or Indonesia.  As one of the forum users have mentioned, keeping the Straits of Malacca open for shipping is in the interest of the international community.  Powers like USA, CHINA will be alarmed if a full scale conflict was allowed to develop.<br><br>Singapore, would probably choose to play its cards to win the favor of the international community rather than just M'sia or Indonesia.  Firstly, to keep dialogs between the 2 countries open for a peaceful settlement, and secondly, as a base for an international peace keeping effort in the region.  Most likely under the watchful eye of the US Carrier Battle Groups.<br><br>Choosing to side with either M'sia or Indonesia in such a conflict, may discredit Singapore's voice in the international community.<br><br></div>

(0) | Trackback (0)<br><br>Sungei Pinayas is a small river lying approximately six kilometres south of Kalabakan running from west to cast/into Cowie Harbour in Tawau Residency in Sabah. It lies about ten kilometres north of the Indonesian border. This area is covered by thick jungle and vast areas of swamp. On the 28 January a Security Force patrol of about thirty strong were operating in the area of Sungei Pinayas looking for enemy tracks or resting places along the river bank when they were suddenly encountered by an enemy party, who were armed and uniformed. Fire was exchanged by both sides which resulted in three enemy being killed with no casualties to Security Forces. On breaking contact the enemy withdrew southwards. The following arms and ammunition were also recovered from this contact : One sten gun, two rifles Mark 4, five hand-grenades. four sten magazines, 134 rounds of 9 mm. ammunition, 276 rounds of .303 ammunition.</blockquote><blockquote>21 January 1964 Indon Activity in the Merutai Area, Sabah<br>Sound Off ! (0) | Trackback (0)<br><br>Merutai is a town of a few hundred people situated on the Sungei Merutai running North to South approximately twenty-five kilometres north-west of Tawau. The town lies on a direct route between Kalimantan and Tawau. On the 27 January two Ibans were working in a plantation just outside Merutai when they were confronted by a party of seven Indonesian irregulars who suddenly fired upon them. The two Ibans with their parangs counter attacked the enemy party killing one enemy and wounding two others. The enemy with the two wounded fled.<br><br>The authorities were immediately informed about this incident and a patrol of Security Forces was immediately sent to try to capture the fleeing enemy. Security Force follow-up operations resulted in a contact with this enemy group which resulted in the two wounded being captured. Later during the day also in this area, four Indonesian irregulars armed and in uniform robbed two shops. The loot consisted of green peas, rice, a cooking pot, vegetable oil and chickens. Two more armed and uniformed Indonesian irregulars also robbed a further Chinese house in the same area. All the enemy escaped north.<br><br>Security Forces were informed and a follow-up operation commenced. The followup patrol was ambushed by this same party of enemy. The patrol returned the fire and killed a further enemy. As a result of these incidents at Merutai on the 27 January two enemy were killed and two captured. There were no Security Force casualties.</blockquote></div>

(0) | Trackback (0)<br><br>Pa Banger is an Iban longhouse five kilometres from the Sarawak-Kalimantan border in 4th Division of Sarawak. At midday on the 25 January about eleven men in jungle green uniform of the type used by Indonesian regulars and armed with rifles approached the longhouse. The soldiers informed the inhabitants of the longhouse that they were Indonesian Regular soldiers. The people in the longhouse were frightened and ran into the jungle nearby. About half-an-hour later there were two loud explosions. From the jungle edge the inhabitants of the longhouse saw it starting to burn.<br><br>A villager reported to the police at LONG BANGER some four kilometres to the north and a helicopter was utilised to take a platoon to the village. Later in the afternoon tracks were found leading back across the border towards the Indonesian kampong of Ba Siok, which lies one kilometre to the east of the border. It was known that there was a detachment of Indonesian Regular Army at Ba Siok.<br><br>On the 1 January Security Forces operating near Pa Banger had found and destroyed an Indonesian Army machine-gun post within Sarawak territory, the crew of four all being killed in the action. The attack on the longhouse at Pa Banger appears to have been carried out in retaliation for the destruction of the machine-gun post. The fact that the enemy were armed and uniformed and moved towards Ba Siok after the incident confirms that they came from Ba Siok and were members either of the Indonesian Regular or Irregular Forces.<br><br>As a result of this incident a Malaysian Security Force platoon was sent to live in Pa Banger. The local inhabitants decided to send the women and children to the safety of a nearby villag,e while the men would remain and harvest the crops.</blockquote><blockquote>30 January, 1964<br>On the 30 January a small military patrol, operating near Pa Banger to ensure that there were no enemy in the area, made contact with an enemy group of approximately 20 armed with one mortar, several automatic weapons and rifles, all of which were fired in the engagement.<br><br>There was an exchange of fire which lasted from 1105 hours until 1330 hours, but due to the dense secondary jungle, and thick foliage, it was very difficult for the two groups to see each other. As a result the firing was sporadic and inaccurate. The Security Forces suffered no casualties. There were no known casualties to the enemy. The enemy were in green uniforms and were accompanied by one civilian in plain clothes who was apparently acting as a guide. A follow-up patrol found the tracks of this group leading southward across the border.<br><br>The presence of a guide in civilian clothes indicates that the enemy group were presumably new to the area and unfamiliar with it and therefore had to be guided into and out of Pa Banger. A few empty cartridge cases were recovered from the area on all of which the Indonesian ordnance factory stamp was clearly marked. The initials PSM can be seen on most Indonesian equipment and is used in a similar way to the British WD and arrow sign.</blockquote>east malaysian iban and dayak having koppasus as bbq.<br><br></div>

(0) | Trackback (0)<br><br>The Serudong river is three miles within and runs parallel to the International border in the south of Tawau Residency of Sabah. At the mouth of the river is the village of Serudong. The village itself is about four miles from the border. Across the border lies the Indonesian island of Nunukan, where there are located two Indonesian marine platoon bases. These Indonesian marine forces ostensibly carrying out anti-smuggling activities in East Kalimantan, are known to have lately organised training camps for training Indonesian Irregulars, who made incursions into Tawau Residency in mid-December, 1963.<br><br>Security Forces in Tawau Residency are continuing with Â“mop-upÂ” operations after the Kalabakan raid of 29 December, 1963, by Indonesian Regulars and Irregulars totalling between 140 and 180 men of whom about 31 were lndonesian marines. This force was made up of small groups of 30-40 men each. Security Forces in the Serudong area of Tawau Residency received information that a small enemy group was operating in this area.<br><br>On 16 January a patrol of Security Forces met with this enemy group. The group were identified as enemy by the uniforms they wore and because they were armed with an assortment of weapons not used by Malaysian forces, Fire was immediately exchanged by both sides. During the fire fight one enemy was killed, and the enemy disengaged and withdrew in a southerly direction. There were no Security Force casualties. From interrogation of previous captured and surrendered enemy personnel and enemy documents recovered in earlier incidents, this dead enemy has been identified as Berunton alias Ramli, who was an Indonesian Marine corporal of the Korps Komando Operasi. Berunton was also a leader of one of the enemy groups which incurred into the Kalabakan area.<br><br>At the time of contact, this enemy group appeared to have been lost in the Serudong area and without food for several days. It was apparently trying to withdraw to Indonesian Kalimantan. Subsequently on the 19 January at 1630 hours two more enemy surrendered to a Security Force patrol in this same area. This was the result of Security Forces follow-up after the incident on 16 January. These two enemy were armed and in uniform and on sight of the Security Force patrol came out and surrendered, These two enemy were immediately sent to Tawau for interrogation by the police and army, and it was discovered from their statements that they were in the same group that was contacted on 16 January 1964.</blockquote>lost lol</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>24th January 1964 - Enemy Activity in Sematan Pueh Area<br>Sound Off ! (0) | Trackback (0)<br><br>Sematan is a town of 600 inhabitants in the First Division of Sarawak. It is about 11 kilometres from the Indonesian border with the jungle between. Pueh is a small kampong (village) 12 kilometres to the west of Sematan. There are 20 houses in the kampong. Across the border and 80 kilometres from it is the Indonesian town of Singkawang. It is known that an Indonesian Army unit known as Border Raiders together with a force of Indonesian Irregulars were stationed there. Both Sematan and Pueh are in an area subject to curfew between the hours 1900 and 0700.<br><br>According to information given to the Police the next day by the occupant of a house, two men called at his house at about 2000 hours. One was ex-PC, Lansam, a Sarawakian, the other was an unidentified Chinese. They were in uniform and carried grenades in their belts. They demanded food and got it, the occupants being in fear. The occupant recognised one of the two as a former resident of Pueh who had disappeared about a year ago leaving his family behind. The other man was not known to him. He asked for information about his family as he wished to take them away to Indonesian Borneo. The occupant told him what he knew about the family. Both of them went away into the darkness and spent the night in a basha on the outskirts of the village.<br><br>On the 18th January, afternoon according to information given to Special Branch by another occupant of the kampong this same former resident of the kampong called at another house.He was accompanied by three other Dayaks and an unknown Chinese. The Dayaks were identified by the occupant as Indonesian because of their accent. They were all in uniform and one carried a rifle. The man carrying the rifle demanded cooked rice for 20 persons which he wished to take away. They waited for 30 minutes during the cooking of the rice. The man with the rifle ate his portion and they all left in the direction of the coast to the north.<br><br>Between 26/28 January, 1964 Singkum Ak Lacen, resident of Pueh, failed to return home after his work on 26 January. He was present in the longhouse on the night of 17/ 18th when On the 28th he reported to the Police at Sematan, one kilometre away to the west from Pueh that a group of men numbering five all in uniform and armed with rifles, invaded his house and forcibly took him to a place about 2 kilometres away in the jungle. There he saw a larger group. There were about fifty of them. They were all in uniform and all armed with rifles. In this group he noticed the two men who had called at his house on the night of 17/1&amp;h. The rest he had never seen or met before.<br><br>One of the men who appeared to be the leader demanded that he should lead them to Sematan. This he did walking ahead of them through the jungle. They reached Gunong Tamin about 8 kilometres south of Sematan about 1700 hours on 28 January. He watched for an opportunity to slip away from them into the jungle. This he succeeded in doing on the 28th and one reaching Sematan made the report.<br><br>22 and 23 January, 1964<br>Enemy Activity in the Nibong area. Nibong is a small village of about 200 inhabitants in the First Division of Sarawak. It is situated 4 kilometres from the Sarawak-Indonesian border and is 80 kilometres south-east of Kuching. Directly across the border in mid-January there was known to be an Indonesian force ccntaining elements of 602 Battalion of the Indonesian Regular Army. A platoon of 30 men had been deployed by Malaysian Security Forces at Nibong to watch the frontier in that area. During daylight hours, patrolling was carried out and at night trip-flares and other similar devices were put out to give warning to anyone moving near that position.<br><br>A curfew was in operation in this area between the hours of 1900 and 0700. At 0300 hours on the morning of 23 January three and a half hours before dawn, a trip-flare 160 metres to the south of the platoon position was ignited. Five Â‘figures in jungle uniform of the type worn by lndonesian Regular soldiers were clearly seen by the light of the flare. They were armed and fire was immediately opened by them and returned by the Security Forces. This continued for about forty minutes. A dawn patrol sent out to investigate found the tracks for five people which led unmistakably to and from the border.</blockquote>waaargh!!! im spent!... lazy some more..<br>my conclusion is..if indon armed forces were dorky loser back then... they will be loser too now...</div>
