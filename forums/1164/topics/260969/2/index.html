U need to have a very strong reason or able to surpass their internal conflicts by force to start a war. By judging from Indonesia political situation, the chance for Indonesia to attack Singapore is much much higher than Malaysia.<br>And to elaborate further, Singapore is doing well among south east asia. If Singapore is arrogant, the people of Indonesia will not even mind invading Signapore. To them, Singapore is just a red dot.<br>While Malaysia is an islamic country, if Indonesia do declare war on Malaysia, their people will mind...<br><br>So whether there is a war among malaysia, singapore and indonesia, the chance is very very small. Because, Singapore is worthless to be invaded in the eyes of a strategist.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think indo cant rant all it can about attacking M. They will only end up 17thousand new indonesia.<br><br>Full fledge war with a commonwealth country which is still closely friend of the united kindom..who is active members of the UN ..... which its army were better equip and wel fed... which still have defensive agreement to deter the very thing that the indo want to do...is very unlikely.<br><br>4 million willing to die? i dont think so........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>M will definately get help from the FDPA (u can say what ever u want about FPDA... but i actually read the actual defence agreement) Aussies will definately come. M diplomatic front will definately wage diplomatic war in the UN... Indonesia will cried foul play....but who attack first? Indo will get the sanction..big time.<br><br>Singapore probably wont take side (a good desision) But will condemned Indo action in breaching the spirit of asean.</div>
