            <div class='col-md body'>By gawds the number of Noobs we have in this topic is ridiculous.<br><br>to crusader91<br><br>already said it's not a straight forward thing.  You want to knock-out air fields you must first be -able- to hit them.<br><br>Arty for accuracy? Are there enough batteries to hit them all simultaneously. How do you conduct battle damage assessment? If you hit civilian - boo boo-.<br><br>Astros for runway craters? I dont even move where that will land. Air strike, your planes have to enter our air space first.<br><br>BTW, if you shift troops that far south into johore, it's definitely noticeble by at least -12 hours- You think unlimited ammo/fuel like C&amp;C?<br><br>First strike is the aggressor and you have to declare war even if you did it after you fired, it's an international boo boo.  We do not take our -externally placed- assets into consideration for immediate defense of our land.  They can be our second strike package though.  That 20 odd tempest in Taiwan, wont make a real difference, if they did, we wouldnt have permernantly park them there.<br><br>No, even if our air fields are taken out temporarily, there's no ability by any force in the region to prevent our immediate mob and arming of perhaps 3 full strength divisions within 8 hours ready to go.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Regarding the situation in Kalimantan, Indon probably have the ground advantage. However, Fuel + other logistics will probably reduce the entire assualt to infantry only after 72 hours.  In 72 hours, for a HUGE forest like kalimantan is nothing.  Our northern neighbour will have plenty of space to absorb. Imagine Germany in WWI trying to invade Russia in WWII with the same initial surprise strike. That's what will happen.<br><br>Tripwire - Your troops "after finishing EM" aint going to teleport over to W M to fight.<br><br>Ability for the Indon Navy to transport armour/troops using the Malacca straits into W M whilst in the presence of the RMN is in an even worse situation than China trying to invade Taiwan 10 years ago.<br><br>Your ability is restricted to only risky heliops inface of CAP and naval AA capabilities as well as rubber dinghy boats ala Japs @ singapore straits at night during WWII - one way trip with limited supplies/food/ammo.  Please dont talk about naval superiorty/subs.  I'm pretty sure the RMN is waaaaaaaaayy better right now. Not to mention your angle of approaches are limited and predictable as you have to avoided heavily RSN patrolled waters unless you want to draw us into a two front war.<br><br>I would look forward to seeing F-16s Dfing MiG 29s. I'm very sure it will all be captured on E2Cs for examination/reference.<br><br>AFAIK, the amount of Anti armour HH/infantry usable weapons in W M is even enougn for me to worry.  Using those to handle RC capable armoured indo troops is definitely not a problem.  Regarding armour ops.  Indon uses mainly the AmX-13, some partially upgraded to SM1 standard by us i think.  I see the CIS AGL 40 in the picture of an APC. I must remind you. All armoured ops -must be supported with fuel and ammo- What logistical resources does the Indon army have now?  I do not know but i doubt it sufficient for an armoured thrust to be used effectively.<br><br>Any suddenly conflict with low levels of preparation will come to a halt earlier than any expectations.<br><br>Fuel, Food, Ammo and Communication (+ batteries) are important to keeping armies both defending and attacking moving.<br><br>Without which, little boys dreams of "I pwnz you, lolz" and "I'm the |3373$7" aint ever going to happen.<br><br>So if you want to talk about war, please go do your research first.<br><br>Edit: Pictures use to tell a thousand words.  But nowadays, you have PS, so pictures only tell a few words in our time even those few might not even be accurate for that matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My bad for those comments.How dumb of me to think of attacking when it is seriously non of our business.Let's just sit and slack in our COMFORTABLE homes watching the news while our government can just sell them weapons to kill each other,we make money.Then when both of them are so exhausted of killing each other,we move in, in the name of 'peacekeeping',annex both countries(i am sure many will  make lots of comment on this).(quite unrealistic)<br><br>We should not interfere at all since our men will be killed and mind you, war escalates technology and economy in a way(nuclear bombs and US economy),soon our dear neighbours will be more developed than us (which they should be due to natural resources and cheap labour)and the unavoidable thing will happen,singapore will be part of malaysia again(If you seriously don't believe in this,you are hopeless).<br><br>People say i have no right to critisize others but what happened when our flags burnt and we are begin laughed by indonesians as ' a small red dot'.About the most corrupted part,it is in the newspapers(TOday).<br><br>To CM06: <strong>don't</strong> underestimate our enemies because they have the space to   develop nuclear weapons,we don't.This is a forum,no one will actually take it seriously.Civilians death are unavoidable especially in crowded places like singapore.</div>

Very easy to tell who haven`t been in the army or have the faintest idea what they are talking about; militarily speaking. So, you can tell where they are from. Should just boot them out.<br><br>Silly Malaysia thinks FPDA will save them? It`s non-committal. This is no longer the 1940-50s. To fight a war of the scale that is discussed here would involve the full moblization of hundreds of thousands of troops. It is a totally different proposition to send troops and equipment of that number 1 or 2 oceans away when your own survival is not at stake. This is not world war 2 nor the cold war. Where is the money going to come from? From Malaysia`s corrupted and incredibly `blur' Malay politicians.<br><br>Someone mentioned about war preparations? This takes months for countries the size of Malaysia and indonesia. Not unless if you`re Singapore or Israel where the machinery and processes are in place; where we can go to war in a few hours; because that`s the essence of the grand strategy. Even then, Malaysia is a victim and beneficiary of her own geography just like Singapore. The smallish MAF would have to to move troops and equipment from all over the place. Prior to this, orders would have to be filtered to units all over the country. Many intelligence agencies from many countries would already be aware. It is no secret that the MAF expects the SAF to come to them even if they suddenly have crazy ideas about attacking a military many times thier size and capability. The fact of the matter is that the SAF would always be attacking in force first. That`s the main part of the detterance that the Singapore government has built up. That is what the MAF and even the Indons are worried about most. The ability to see first and stike first and neutralize the enemy even before they`re ready to get into thier respective formations.<br><br>Haiz...these monkeys keep saying the same thing. But maybe it`s a good as well in an indirect way. There is only a small chance they can use the Astross missiles on singapore. The reason is what I`ve mentioned above. Singapore will always have the initiative.  And even if they can get off some lucky shots, they can`t kill the SAF or Singapore with those. They do stand a big chance of killing servicemen and damaging equipment of US forces based or in transit in Singapore bases. lol. You know... the reason why they bought them is because thier artillery is nearly non-existent relatively speaking.<br><br>I see posters who keep talking about race and religion as people who stay in a coconut shell. It is a malay saying right? During the height of the simpadan crisis, the Indons were ready to take Malaysian blood just like the `Konfrontasi'. The Arabs are not united. In fact, some are good sleeping partners with Israel now. The OIC is not united.  Lol. Wake up. Was`nt there supposed to be some prophecy that the muslims would be divided up till the very end of times. Lol. anyway, you would catch my drift.<br><br>Actually, I think we should come in and save the Malaysian arses when both sides are exhausted which won`t take too long under the aegis of the UN. The indonesian military do not have the capability to wage a war that can literally take over the whole of Malaysia. East Malaysia is poorly defended. That is possible but the peninsula is a different matter all together. Anyhow, we should come in and help negotiate a peace treaty between the two. And yes, we should take a slice of Malaysia as well at that point of time. Afterall, we all know(and the Malaysians too(chuckles)) that Singapore would make thier country a better place than what it is today.<br><br>Urm..ok what else before i go out? Ok, the MAF sucks. Mostly because they are led by uncompetitive bumi-shitz. Take them and drop them in competitive countries and they`ll be like mice in cages of tigers. This is not to say all of them are like so; more like the upper echelon of the bumi society there. The zoo...opps...i mean airforce takes the lead with planes, systems and planes from all over the place. And the planes fall to the ground like flies too; by themselves! Saves us the trouble too. The navy is in second place and the army last.<br><br>Singaporeans, however, should be under no illusions as per whether the Malaysians are prepared and would like to save us. Just look at the monkeys in power there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont confuse facts with arrogance Mr Chino. Ahaha. Anything wrong with the post factually? Often, the failure to succeed results in allegations of arrogance. Actually, a better term to use would be outright jealousy. During the Simpadan crisis, the Indons accused the Malaysians of blatant arrogance. Pot calling the kettle black? Ahaha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, who here believes that the SAF will not have a say to the RMN and  TNI-Navy to skirmish in our regional waters?<br><br>We will be dragged in, and only to preserve our own national interest.  Not Indonesia's, not Malaysia's.  So like i said before, our best bet is to step between them, help them to negotiate a solution to prevent ANY escalation to war.  They can screw each other in the Jungles of Sarawak for all we care, just don't drag it into the waters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the most probable reaction Singapore will have is to declare Code Red against both sides and refuse to take a stand.<br>We'll probably defend against both Indo and Malaysia and wait for the peacekeepers to come in.<br><br>Very interesting scenario, take either side we will also die.<br>If war breaks, Singapore will be the battlefield in the middle. Each side will try to take Singapore as a staging ground. I think both sides will shell us until theres nothing left in Singapore Island and then move to confront each other.<br><br>Singapore would probably not know who's the enemy until we're struck first.<br>But then again, its very improbable the war will happen.</div>
