A contract for the C-130 upgrade program was to have been awarded in April.<br><br>The 12 C-130 transport fleet is due for complete modernization enabling the fleet to remain operational for another 10 years. A senior Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) official said the freezing of the C-130 upgrade program will adversely affect the fleet's operational capabilities as not enough funds are earmarked for the service to meet its high-priority needs.<br><br>The Malaysian government is considering purchasing new A400M military transports (like the one seen here) from France, instead of going ahead with a planned upgrade of the Royal Malaysian Air Force's fleet of C-130 aircraft.<br><br>He further noted that as something of an experimental exercise, a contact was awarded in 2004 to local company Airod SDN BHD (Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia), which had teamed with L-3 Spar of Canada to install a new global-air-traffic-management (GATM) suite on one C- 130 aircraft. After trials of the new GATM suite, the Malaysian government had decided in principle to award a full contact to Airod to upgrade the C-130 fleet with new flight-management systems and inertial-navigation and autopilot systems, in addition to the standard GPS system.<br><br>The RMAF official said the government should rethink its decision, however, because the existing fleet of 12 C-130s recently went through a tanker-conversion program, from standard-sized C- 130H to the extended-fuselage C-130H-30 configuration. The conversion program was carried out by Airod, with technical support from Lockheed Martin (Marietta, GA). The conversion increases the available cargo space by 33%, and the aircraft's internal cargo- handling system was modified to cover the extension. Under the second part of the upgrade, Lockheed Martin provided Airod with modification kits to equip two C-130Hs with a self-contained air-to- air refueling system. This system is designed as roll-on/roll-off equipment, which allows for an air-to-air refueling capability while preserving the aircraft's ability to function as a transport. Modification of the first of two aircraft was completed in 2003.<br><br>Malaysian government officials argue that, for its long-term needs, the country's military should have an air-lifter that can conduct long-range missions and overseas deployments. However, the RMAF official noted that the existing C-130s are proven tankers and are more than adequate for the service's domestic needs. He pointed out the Royal Malaysian Air Force has not only considerable experience operating C-130 but also already possesses the tools, equipment, and trained personnel to support it. He further argued that by adding a new fleet of Airbus A400M military transports will entail immense costs associated with a new aircraft type - the hundreds of thousands of items that need to be stocked up, from spare (and expensive) engines right down to a simple circuit breaker, tools of every description, ground and air equipment, and training (which may mean the purchase of a simulator costing as much as an aircraft if not more) not just of aircrews but ground crews and other support staff. - Pulkit Singh<br><br>Copyright Horizon House Publications, Inc.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My whole point is discussion can do without the racist remarks and nation bashing. If it was about TNI and MAF then just compare that both - you dont go say bla bla bla... but you know, SAF still better then both. It is as if you are so insecure that you need to slip such statement in everytime to feed your ego. P.s i meant 'you' as in a general referance. not Typhoon in any way.<br></blockquote>Lol. The forum reads SGforums. If the Sgreans feel proud about thier military or nation, there is nothing wrong with that.  The only person who is insecure is you. Military comparisons would invariably bring in other countries(potential adversaries and such) and who is not nationalistic enough but feel proud about thier own accomplishments. You do that in your own forums. Now go and sit in one corner and think about it or enjoy the discussions.<br><br>At any rate, it is telling about the capability of the MAF that she has to rely on a potential enemy to help her out against the Indons. I have had a brief experience with the Indons. I think they are more organized and gutsy.<br><br>Anyway, it is a fact that Singapore is not obliged to help Malaysia and vice-versa. It is also likely that the Malaysians would be cheering all the way if Singapore is to fail as a state. Singapore would probably protect the vital sea-lanes. That would be about all. If it helps that peninsula Malaysia remains in `our' orbit. So be it. We can allow East Malaysia to fall into the hands of the Indons if it helps us. Anyway, we should/will do whatever is expedient for our own survival.<br><br>Like i`ve said before, being small has its advantages. Conversely, the Malaysians are in a more precarious position where loosing territory is concerned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So in the end.. its all about the $$$ like i said in the earlier post. $$$ can buy you military protection. And whoever has more superior military can afford to defend those that need help. And who give money in Malaysia at the East ?.. I am not trying to get into any tenchnical reasons cause its too long.. and i just cant be bothered to type it properly.. Malaysia has to act accordingly do anything to protect , and also SG to help too.<br><br>I leave the racial political issues out.<br><br>And those talking about distribution of wealth , fair enough.. to develop those than return. But it can be distributed quite evenly for ALL to proper. So then it comes down to politicians.. how they can make or break the states.<br><br>And question about SG going where ? Any developed country or developing country as long as they want to go , having powerful military and state of the art technology will make you more impressive and so able to be technologically MORE advanced n may become the area's reckoned power.<br><br>Then if u really look in to a bigger.. further scale , wider of things , all nations will have to be united to be a combined superpower.<br><br>There will never be world peace.. unless..<br><br>I hope you guys understand what i am trying to say .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>And realistically, even the economic growth of this city state has its limits.</blockquote>Lateral expansion of course is determined by size. However, economic growth is not determined by the latter alone as all countries would reach thier respective spatial limits some time in the future.<br><br>What we have been doing is jumping the ladder in investing and cultivating newer industries as they come and off-loading non-productive ones to niegbouring countries. So long as we jump faster and move faster, there is no need for worry. It can be construed that we are constantly growing because we keep starting and cultivating newer industries.<br><br>Realistically, technology and industries are constantly evolving. We might never know we might return to manufacturing as a core sector because other countries do not have the acumen yet to manufacture the goods of the future. For the lay-person or worker on the street, it is a case of life-long employability and not employment. You will have to move around but still have jobs. Not so much different than in the West if you think.</div>

I am too tired now to response, but I don't really think i need to anyway.<br><br>You're argument of Yugoslavia compared to Kuwait is plainly weak. There are much more then just a 'mere' comparison to be made. Probably you forgot the importance of oil and other regional importance, but hey - as long you're happy hey go for it. And of course if you are going to to use the term nationstate, you should also know that the nationstate contruct bears more external then internal influences right? my suggestion to you would be start reading a little deeper on the writings of more popular ones like samuel huntington,  Francis Fukuyama and Edward Said.<br><br>No. obviously Singapore is not obligated in anyway to assist and I don't think anyone in the forum did say that singapore will definitely assist blindly.

Obviously there is no one true right or wrong, but by saying it is definitely wrong surely reflects something more. Your reasoning are uncalled for, egoistic, bias, and anything less then objective. I would not even think it is nationalistic. Maybe some Malaysian stepped on your toes before I recon. Who knows.<br><br>Arthas79, fine 'realistically' Singapore might return to manufacturing, I would keep an open mind to this suggestion of yours but please do enlighten me with your reasonings, well offhead agaist popular understanding of 'the 3rd world' labour and of course China. Dumbdown your sophistication of language and please elaborate further "If it serves our interest to see Malaysia dissolve and we have delivered humanitarian aid to the civilian population, we would have already done a great service." Justify your claims.<br><br>It is always good to say "You can`t say that Singapore will definitely intervene to help Malaysia. Singapore is not controlled by Malaysia and vice-versa." Sounds REALLY nuetral. Yea its true no doubt, which let me affirm again no one did say that.<br><br>What benefit would singapore get with the dissolve of Malaysia?You have such strong believes that it would be at Singapore's interest, so please do explain WHY<br><br>p.s: It was on purpose that I am not polite and it is simply because you was not polite.
