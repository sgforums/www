Neither side has the might to wipe out each other.   Indonesia will be able to defend but not conquer.  Where can the war beak out?  The potential hotspots are in Kalimantan area where there is oil - and thats so ulu.  So there might be some scuffles but not full scale war.<br><br>malaysia don't have the resources to invade and who wants Kalimantan - its all rainforest and hilly terrain.  And Indonesia has neither the reosources to invade Sabah and Sarawak - their army is not that well equipped.<br><br>so, if a scuffle broke out in Kalimantan, Singapore can remain neutral and go to Asean and ask for peaceful settlement. And I don't think Jakarta will go whack KL, firstly, they are all muslims, and there is no such disparity between Sini and shites as in middle east.  Moreover, Indonesia has more oil than Malaysia, so why go whack Malaysia?  Its not as if Malaysia is doing so well.  Moreover, geographically Malaysia is not the border neighbour of Indonesia (except Kalimantan).  The akward neighbour is Singapore.<br><br>Hence whoever fight will probably threaten Singapore to let them use us as staging area or use our base else we get invaded.  Ditto for Malaysia - but Singapore is not stupid either, once we have sensed this happening, you can bet there will be open mob and US will have park an aircraft carrier in Changi liao.</div></blockquote>there is really no need to threaten singapore... a simple message from indonesia president to join them to wack malaysia is all that is needed to convince the ever so calculative, self serving singapore govt to realise where the gold is.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>FPDA dont include east malaysia... why? because the brits, Aussies, kiwis and singapore are alot smarter then you think... </blockquote>lol extremely funny! during the confrontation indonesian infitrate east malaysia and from that the bulk of commonwealth soldier were in east malaysia defending it. Even then the indonesia did not pour 4 million men into east malaysia nor the peninsular.<br><br>so your implying that east malaysia doesnt count in FPDA is funny. Not to mention that is the most probable area that the indon will invade! excluding it is dumb!<br><br>FPDA is to defend malaysia and singapore from the agression of indonesia. Nowadays they amend the agreement here and there so that it would always be relevant. Why? because the threat from indonesia towards singapore and malaysia were very real.<br><br>anyway ever heard of the 1st SIR incident during the confrontation?<br></div>

US, France, UK, Japan, China, Singapore ....... +++++  Why, face the fact if they are so extreme to send 4 million idiots to start a war, the big countries will not sit there and let them affect the 2 main trade routes between east and west and will never even let them take control of it.  Letting Indonesia control the 2 most important ship route between east and west is totally unacceptable. Western power will want to safe guard their interest in the east, and not let the 2 straits totally fall into indonesia hands and same apply to the Eastern big power also.<br><br>With interest so great, UN will come in play and if indonesia does not complies, then it will indeed face a force marching that is greater then the desert storm !!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Oi dont drift away from topic.<br><br>--&gt;Short ninja/crusader91 pls take your "e-peen contest" elsewhere<br>Our northern neighbour vs SG thread is somewhere else please go necro or something. It wont happen. It's stupid if it happens. Alot of men on both sides will die for absolutely nothing.  There's no way we can effective govern an inch of soil across the straits and neither country can withstand the political disheaval from it. Please dont talk about "pwning" each other. It's a stupid term you learn from playing too many pc-era games. When you see blood and body parts flying and splattering on you, you wont even find your dick and balls in your wet underwear.<br><br>Back on topic:<br><br>FPDA may not be commital. Doesnt mean that we wont commit at all personally, i would be surprise if we dont commit either. Once we start, the Aussies and Kiwis will be able to broaden the conflict by opening up a front on the far east as well. We are talking about the largest regional naval projection power and long range strike aircraft from the kangaroos and koala bears.<br><br>Please, dont be silly, letting Indon take over our northern neighbour will result in them taking over us 10 years later while in the mean time we have lots of insurgents and "terrorists" wrecking havoc on our day-to-day lives and economy. So we will eventually fall into chaos and "assisted in peace control" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>We may not defend East M, but it definitely wont stop us from pouring our troops north to secure borders while reliefing and allowing more W M troops to ship-lift across to E M. We wont die for their forest/oil palms over there but i'm sure we will gladly help send them over to die for theirs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Not to mention, if we help them win ...$$$/economic concessions will pour in for our help. Oh yeah, You think Brunei will take this lying down?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the only thing SG will do is not to take sides, but to take the matter into a way where Singapore is best at, talking. We will ask them to settle this in a much more black &amp; white or a conference method instead of sending someone's father or son to die in war. If Indo decides to attack Malaysia, we will most likely just discourage their actions etc.<br><br>Of course, if a war do break out, the one thing that will be sure to happen is that man will be mob into defense position in case of any happenings.</div>
