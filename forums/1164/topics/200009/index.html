It give me the impression that the Israelis action are pre-planned. You see why would The Lebanese cross over Israel to kidnap them when their whole division are at the border and ready to search lebanon ??<br><br>It will be no surprise later when the whole thing simmer down and we learnt that that those two Israelis sldiers are infact in Lebanon...<br><br>I have a feeling the Israel wants Syria and Iran to give support and that gives the Israelis reason to act against them... this is nothing new -- when it comes to US and Israel foreign affairs.

            <div class='col-md body'>War is a dirty game lar.  Look at it this way.  Israel has fought how many wars since they were formed, in most circumstances, they were attacked or pre-empted attempts to invade them.  But have they any reason not to strike back or pre-empt?  "Terrorists" infiltrate them every day, with plots to blow themselves up schools, buses and crowded area.  Well, Israel doesn't have such "tremendous" human bomb capabilities to strike back, but they do have lots of US supplied PGMs, so why not use it?<br><br>The middle east is a perpetual state of war with Israel lar.  Its just a truce to date, and everybody's waiting for a chance to "wipe" Israel off the map.  Fortunately, the arab league can't seem to get their collective shiite together to do anything to Isreal.</div>

Hezbollah does not represent the Lebanese gov. they get their orders from Syria. The Lebanese gov try to get rid of them but is too weak to do anything. These people just want to stay there for the sake of fighting Israel.<br><br>This time, they went into Israel and killed 6 to 8 soldiers and kidnapped another 2 without any reason to begin with.<br><br>I think Israel should go into Syria and hunt down all those terrorist for their coward acts. They might as well change their name to No Bollah (No Balls) rather than Has Balls for the way they fight. Always hiding behind the civilians.<br><br>Death to all these stupid terrorist !</div></blockquote>Hezbollah is not Lebanon. But it IS part of the government of Lebanon.<br><br>The people there support Hezbollah, obviously not all. But ultimately, they were elected to power. You choose ur gov for one reason, to lead your country. And Hezbollah is leading Lebanon to war. I pity the rest who did not vote for Hezbollah.<br><br>The people are now suffering from what they chose.<br><br>The government is weak to take control over hezbollah or it just refuses to do so? Remains to be debated.<br><br>An Israeli warship got hit just hours after the PM of lebanon said that a ceasefire should be reached upon asap on CNN.
