Yes, i also think that the MAF(ironically) wants us to come in and they will fight from the interior where they can inflict the most casualties. They know that they will be decimated in a head-long straight fight given the number of men and equipement Singapore can throw at them at the initial commencement of hostilities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, let's say we presume that we attack the North. Those at the south would not want to join in as they will stand to loose a lot and not gain anything.<br><br>Let's think in this way, while we are attacking the north. They would be getting their resources move in from all over the country, including East malaysia. So when this happens, the east would be a natural for invading troops. Taking this chance, Indonesia would take this chance to take back their long lost territory that they claim to be theirs. Philippines may also join in as they long regarded Borneo island as their country's extension. So in the end, Those in the North may be suffering on 2 fronts.<br><br>Well, If the Thais take this chance to "wipe out" the muslims insurgents at their south, they would push their way down south to claim some land.<br><br>So now, Those up north of us would have 3 fronts to fight. Do you guys think this is possible?<br><br>BTW, does Malaysia has Gurkhas with them? I know Brunei has a detactment of Gurkhas Regiment from UK to protect them.</div>

All our patriotic feeling aside it is apparent that more or less it is a level fight which will ultimately boil down to which side makes the smart moves and which side makes the blunders- which is something quite remarkable (at the risk of sounding patriotic) for the little red dot because you must consider the vast size disparity between the two nations in question.<br><br>The MAF certainly isnÂ’t going to sit around and do nothing while the SAF preps for a possible forward defence, and over the years they have done a decent job of coming up with a credible challenge to this most obvious of SAF strategies. The SAF on the other hand, has also taken steps to make sure that this strategy is still a credible deterrence, and hence the balance of power is maintained.<br><br>I think when it comes down to it, itÂ’s tough to say based on the general quality of troops and equipment which side will emerge with the upper hand. It really boils down to the way the war is fought and which sideÂ’s commander makes the fatal error or brilliant move.<br><br>Is the average SAF conscript really far behind the average MAF soldier in terms of quality? I doubt so. As I have said before and will say again, I think our boys can give a fight when it comes down to it, as they have proven time and time again to other nations in exercises. And the certain Malaysians who promote the "predator race" theory are welcome to ignore this at their own peril just as the Japanese and Germans did in WW2... in any case sterotyping your opponent is already a strategic  mistake of sorts.<br><br>Are the MAF really that far behind in terms of equipment? I think they have a credible answer to most of our systems. While the SAF maintains a quality overmatch, it is certainly not in terms of M1A1 Abrams vs. SaddamÂ’s stripped down 10-Camels-a-tank T-72s.<br><br>So in the end it boils down to how you fight the war, and perhaps the SAF still has a question to answer on its own part: can the scholar generals really make the proper choices when it comes down to it or will they treat war like one game of C&amp;C?<br></div>
