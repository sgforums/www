The apfsds amunition for t-72 is split in two parts, penetrator with sabot and propellant charge. and that's why the length of the penetrator seems to be limited (some say however that loader would accept longer penetrators anyway) and also the amount of propellant is limited. Malaysia bought new APFSDS and now they working on this next - this time the propellant will be in two parts of the amunition - in normal charge and additively around the sabot.

            <div class='col-md body'>We could do all that simultaneously. Hit Johor while moving off along the coast. But that said, the sealift capability needed is quite enormous. I don't think we can do it yet but we desperately need to expand the theatre of battle and not let Johor be the only target that we hit and allow the enemy to bog us down. At the same time, our airforce will do strategic bombing of enemy targets in the vicinity of the bases near our attack points. It's going to be difficult and risky though.<br><br>Here's a website with some interesting bits of Russian tanks and ammunition. <a href="http://www.russianarmor.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.russianarmor.info/</a> But that said, the Poles probably cannot match German or even Russian engineering.

In fact, I would rather eliminate their field armies before staging a siege. Sieges have an uncanny way of turning into hammers and anvils, not for us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, all I can say is that all that is written here is open domain, and I think we've done our best to be sensitive to the Malaysians by portraying them in a fair light in our discussions.<br><br>To be fair, such war gaming speculations are not uncommon in any nation, and indeed the original war gaming opponent in the speculations of the Yanks were the Brits, even if they were allies at that time.<br><br>It boils down to some morbid friendly rivalry I think, the MAF is more likely to be an ally to the SAF then an enemyÂ… for now at least.<br><br>On the other hand, we do have Iron Malaysian, who by all extrapolations probably expects the MAF to be able to best the US Military of perhaps some technologically advanced alien invader.<br><br>His comments on how easily the MAF can pwn anything, as if his potential enemies are blundering fools who have absolutely no idea how to fight a war and use their equipment are quite funny, and the weight of his conviction in his beliefs is even funnier. He actually <span style="font-style: italic;">believes</span> his words:<br><br>From the MAF pwns all forum:<br><br><a href="http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=42237&amp;st=180" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiafinest.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=42237&amp;st=180</a><br><br><blockquote>Its quality that counts.; not quantity. Swedish submarines are extremely noisy. They are no much for superior French technology. Despite being outnumbered, our Agosta and Scorpenes will have no problem detecting and destroying their inferior subs.<br><br>Even their heavily armed frigates are not safe from our Kh-31s and torpedos. What hope is there for transport ships ?<br><br>Assuming that in the early phase of the war, all Malaysian fighters were busy fighting the enemy air force and the Singaporean navy managed to land some soldiers in Malaysia, this attack will still fail because:<br><br>1) Malaysian air superiority will deny them air support.<br>2) Due to limited carrying capacity, they will only be able to transport one or two thousand soldiers.<br><br>One infantry division is all it takes to keep them from advancing beyond their landing area.<br>They will only get pinned down on the beachhead, mercilessly pounded by our artillery.<br><br>In the meantime, we will still press ahead with our invasion of Singapore and then Thailand.</blockquote>Having MAF generals as" confident" with their "war plans" as him is probably something every opponent of Malaysian would wish for in a war.</div>
