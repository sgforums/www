            <div class='col-md body'>the reason that these 2 nation in a kinda standoff is just because of its survival. Its like Turkey and Greece.... they look like going to war any moment, yet they didnt. But their airforce become one of the most experienced and hightech in the world.<br><br>Same as SAF and MAF, it look like these two are going to brawl any time, yet we didnt. Not only it didnt happen, but both country invest in each other economy big time. at the same time, because of this unofficial standoff.. or rivalry, both nation have quite good armed forces. It works even better for SAF because M advancement in millitary were hampered years back because of the economic meltdown, yet they are catching up. These two nation millitary were significant because other asean nation cant reach to the same level as they do.</div>

That means a Malaysian Sukhoi/MiG can fire their R-77s from 50 to 80kms away and turn around at full speed to go beyond reach of enemy AAMs fired at them<br>but the enemy fighters will not be able to outrun the R-77s fired at them from the same range.<br><br>With this tactic, groups of twelve MiGs and Sukhois, each armed with four or six R-77s can take turns to hold off Singaporean and Thai fighters indefinitely<br><br>while Malaysia easily occupy Singapore within the first few days of the war. Regardless of whether Singaporean fighter pilots in Thailand would keep fighting or not, Thailand will see no point in pursuing the war any further ; with Singapore knocked out and the Thai navy decimated by Malaysian Kh-31s. Being entirely within range of Malaysian artillery and not possessing a deadly long range AAM like the R-77 make Singapore the easiest neighbour for Malaysia to beat. Malaysian army can take full control of Singapore in less than a week.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course this dude forgets to mention a rather interesting fact about AAMs and PKs:<br><br><blockquote>Range<br>The R-77's main advantage over the AIM-120 AMRAAM, is in range and maneurability. The longer range is because the R-77 is a larger 200 mm vs 178 mm (8 vs 7 in), heavier 175 vs 150 kg (386 vs 335 lb) missile than the AMRAAM and contains more propellant. <strong>Like most AAM weapons, <span style="color: red;">the claimed range is for a non-maneuvering target, at a high altitude, and probably on a head on aspect with a respectable closing rate</span>. Lower altitudes, rear aspect, or maneuvering targets will all reduce this range, but the same applies to the AMRAAM.</strong><br><br>The planned upgrade of the AIM-120, the AIM-120D, is to have a much greater (+50%) range and thus no-escape zone which will exceed that of the standard R-77 by a large margin. It is unknown how the AIM-120D will compare to the R-77M design in terms of range.</blockquote></div>
