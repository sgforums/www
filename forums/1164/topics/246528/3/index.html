Today`s wars  are run faster. I think speed is a chief criterion as to how the SAF will conduct her wars. That is to fight before the enemy is ready.<br><br>Johor is very small which makes us every smaller. Smaller forces have taken territories larger than the size of Johor. However, the fighting will be rather concentrated and movement of forces easier to discern which is a benefit to the party with superior aerial assets. Again, the SAF is expected to move in first and that is a reasonal proposition since the MAF is scattered througout the peninsula and east Malaysia. There is no way they can beat the SAF where mobilization is concerned. We will be throwing the first punches at the mere sign of war. Realistically, I doubt Singapore will wait when the signs are clear.<br><br>You have brought up an interesting point. Will the populace be hostile? Or will some welcome us or take a neutral stance. Malaysia has a hetrogenous population after all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>if that happen there would be less possibality of war with them because they would definately eradicate the radical first, either by conducting another COIN or civil war. Either way they will win as they did with the comunist. Come to think of it we probably will came and help them fighting the radical instead of fighting them.</blockquote>That all depends on how things turn out, if (touch wood) the radials came in by popular vote, it would not be an insurgency, but rather a fully fledged regime with all the military assets we are talking here, similar to the Iranian revolution. And of course that would be the nightmare scenario that we are considering for the sake of an argument here.<br><br>It is highly unlikely, but the elements are there for such a thing to be possible.<br><br><blockquote>there were a lot of artillery and from my experience with their army they know how to use it and utillies the geographical advantage to evade our jet. The serbs have done that with the american. and i have confirmation that MAF change their doctrine when they learned how the serbs spoof allied air superiority.</blockquote>True, but then again it will be an issue of spoofing tactics versus detection technology. It depends on how you play your cards when it comes to deciding what targets to plink. The Allies in Serbia simply plinked anything that was of interest to them, even if it was a decoy or not, as per their SOP.<br><br>But the difference now is that surveillance technology has also taken a great leap forward. The heavy utilization of long-endurance UAVs will certainly play a large part in this battle to sort out which targets are which. If an arty piece or tank does not move for a long period of time or appears way out of known support lines, suspicions are certainly raised if they are legit or not.<br><br>Once again itÂ’s an issue of technology versus familiarity with terrain. The Serbs were mostly unable to get off their shots and hence their focus was on hiding and setting decoys, but the Malaysians certainly donÂ’t have this luxury, and they have to do plenty of high-signature things (like firing guns) that give us plenty of opportunity to return the favour.<br><br>That said, a more modern example of familiarity with terrain versus technology arises in the fight against the insurgency in Iraq. While the insurgents are able to use their familiarity with the terrain to launch ambushes and IED attacks against American troops, however the Americans are countering this by their heavy use of UAVs to monitor the area virtually 24/7 to catch insurgents in the act of setting up IEDs and ambushesÂ… and catching a fair number of them (very few of the IED planting attempts result in a attack on the Yanks, with the rest being caught, killed or disarmed in the process).<br><br>Both sides are getting in their shots, but neither really have the upper hand (though in terms of bodycount the insurgents are suffering badly but they are able to keep up the attacks, which is a success in itself). Thought recently it seems that the insurgents have shifted targets to civilians as opposed to troops, probably because of the discouraging kill ratio.<br><br>So once again, itÂ’s how you play your cards. If you donÂ’t have terrain you can use technology and tactics to overcome it and vice versa.<br><br><blockquote>ive seen their training. Lets just keep the battle in the air ok.</blockquote>The Malaysian Army is not soft, given they are made out of regularsÂ… however itÂ’s another thing to say the SAF units are unable to put up a decent fight in response (unless you believe the Malay predator race theory being floated on some Malaysian forums).<br><br>It is inevitable that there will be a clash on the ground, hence the SAFÂ’s idea would be to bank on air superiority and technology as a force multiplier while the MAF will naturally look to the land for their solutions.<br><br>Of course itÂ’s one thing to have competent men, but a conventional war is also fought on other levels such as supplies and communications. If these are taken out, no matter how competent the grunt is heÂ’s already fighting at a serious disadvantage. I suspect the SAF is aiming for those things, rather then a simple force-on-force match up.<br><br>The Malaysian problem is that they will have an issue replacing their losses and keeping in quality once they start to mount, while the SAF have less of an issue in quality (given we are not all that great). But then again as it stands I doubt both sides are really battle-tested. Our boys could give the other armies a hard time when it comes down to regional exercises and hence there is no reason to suspect that they lack the proper abilities to stick to a fight.<br><br>That said, our conscripts, despite all their misgivings, are a tad different from the Argentinean conscripts they stuffed on the Falklands to face the British Marines.<br><br>ItÂ’s not our grunts IÂ’m worried aboutÂ… itÂ’s our scholar generals who know jack about combat that might end up leading our men in battle.</div>

When under arty fire and enemy air superiority things will be greatly complicated then the peacetime exercise where you lose no personnel, supplies and equipment.<br><br>Also, getting equipment there is one thingÂ… a whole brigade of troops moving even under the jungle canopy is hardly stealthy at all and represent a rather large signature to IR sensors. And thereÂ’s no way you can drive tanks undetected even if in the jungle if the enemy has his thermal eyes on you, the engines are virtual heat beacons. The whole movement itself can become a battle.<br><br>Of course thereÂ’s another questionÂ… when you get to Johor what then? Do you prepare defences or engage in an open conventional assault against the SAF? (if they have already taken over Johor). In the open conventional assault scenario I suspect the SAF will have the upper hand.<br><br>Not that the MAF shouldnÂ’t march troops south ASAP, but I think the whole operation is not without itÂ’s possible foils and problems.<br><br>Of course this assumes a zero-hour exploit by the SAF where they manage to get attack on the opening of hostilities. Logically speaking this is not the mostly likely scenario and the MAF would have already placed a healthy number of troops, heavy units, and arty pieces in Johor in the event of bad tensions, and the jungle marches after these are to reinforce the front.<br><br><blockquote>if we learned enough geography we will know that its a defender heaven. Too many small hills and dense secondary jungle a perfect ambush country.... and seing the way our SAF climb hills during an attack.....</blockquote>I think if the SAF has to be bogged down in bitter hill-to-hill fighting then things have already gone greatly wrong. More likely they will attempt to control important lanes of transport and urban centres, and the battles will be decided there rather then in the jungles ala. Vietnam. And in an urban setting our boys are on a more level playing field, though the fighting might be hellish as well.<br><br>I suspect we will avoid jungle combat as and when we canÂ… while the MAF will press the green for cover from technological advantage as well as to press their own advantage to try to launch their own attacks.<br></div>

They are very much prepared to have you ripped apart over Simpadan. It is completey naive to think countries will go war for these reasons. Further, you have neither a binding treaty not alliance.

It is completely within the realm of necessity that we will ensure that our backs are protected. Of course, the reality is that there is no way the Indons can surge troops up to anyone`s borders for a long time.

And force a settlement by crushing the MAF which they can do just by comparing/looking at our current assets. However, external powers(especially the US) would not simply sit still and watch a key node in the global financial and economic system be taken by a bunch of radical islamists. The costs are too high. The US have always taken the fight to places where it matters in spite of domestic pressures. The US and other major powers will never risk Singapore falling and SEA turning into an radical Islamic caliphate.  [/quote]</div>

Hence, they will actually fight for Singapore. They certainly have no problem going to war with Malaysia( same religion, politics, race, etc) during the `Konfrontation'. Tens of thousands(including paliamentarians) wanted a new `Krontatation' after simpidan.

(my friend from SAR unit was call up that morning) and send a message to curtain nationalism in Singapore.<br></blockquote>I reckon you are talking about a military exercise. Dozens of exercises are conducted each year by many countries around the world. Some of which comes with political messages. Many countries use these exercises to thier own advantage in underlining political messages but it does not determine thier actual actions during a real event. The FPDA, for example, holds numerous exercises each year. Who is the target? Does it mean the Australians, Brits and Kiwis will hop over to help Malaysia in an event of war with Indonesia? Answer : No.<br><br>Singapore has numerous exercises with our Indonesian counterparts each year. Can I say Indonesia would come to our aid in an event of a war?<br><br>War is a totally different thing as compared political statements of solidarity, unity, etc. Most countries will not go to war unless thier survivability is at stake. War comes with enormous economic, financial and human costs. The exception being major powers and developed nations like the US which has the ability to absorb the costs of wars.<br><br><blockquote><br>In any case i think Singapore would only take such a drastics action if it is national security and that would be because both nations become ultra radical as you mention.<br></blockquote>We have  not much issues with the Indons. The corrupt Malaysians are a dfferent story. Water could be a reason. Anyway, we reserve the ability to give them a good arse-whacking if they try to be funny. This kindda of thing affects pride; thiers. Especially since Singapore is much smaller.<br></div>
