But the entire war will get bogged down to an urban warfare scenario, and we don't quite have the armour to deal with that just yet unless the SAF does turn the Leopard 2s we will get into urban warfare models, which is quite likely since MBTs of that size are restricted to largely open land.<br><br>In an urban warfare scenario, I would be hesitant to charge in even if we have the numbers as things could turn into Pyrrhic victories if we don't watch it. No sense wasting an army, winning a battle and loosing the war at the same time. Just looking at the Israeli performance is enough to give any reasonably competent commander some pause.<br><br>Surely we have counter battery fire that could neutralise arty fire? Do the Malaysians have that sort of thing at the moment? We could also look into UAVs which I would dare say be very useful for such a scenario.</div></blockquote>Well having MBTs around help a lot in FIBUA, ask any grunt who had armour support.<br><br>Is the Israeli performance typical of the IDF usually fights?

They barely managed to pull it off given they were outrunning their supply lines, outnumbered over 10 to 1, and what have you not but I think it goes a long way to prove what you can do if you take the movement of the battle from the enemy and outthink him.<br><br>While the Iraqis actually had more then sufficent firepower to defend Bagdad, the American network centric attack was able to outwit and outfight their defences by keeping several steps ahead of the defenders at all times.

While the technology and doctrine may be up to it, are the nerves of the soldiers capable of taking it?</blockquote>Aye not denying the issues the Yanks faced with their Thunder Runs; in fact I even mentioned it in my post.<br><br>But of course, it does not change the fact that the underlying premise below the current incarnation of Blitzkrieg expressed in the Thunder Runs is very sound. Note that the Yanks went into this with several strategic errors like underbidding their forces, a stretched supply line, and overambitious top brass.<br><br>The fact that they managed to pull it off probably had a lot to do with very fortunate circumstances, as well as their technology being able to take up the slack for them. The thing is, it is my opinion that we should learn from their mistakes not by avoiding the premise of modern Blitzkrieg, but by doing it properly, and a lot more carefully.<br><br><blockquote>The trouble with the Iraqi example was that the enemy in question just crumbled away only to return later. As such, the insurgency battles were a cumulation of many mistakes.<br><br>If the M'sians defend Johor a la Hezbollah, it is going to be certainly a very shot war.</blockquote>I think a lot of the mistakes, political and the like, made during the post-invasion handing of Iraq by the Yanks had a lot to do with why the insurgency managed to happen. But thatÂ’s really something beyond the grunts.<br><br>And why keep drawing on Hezbollah as a proper defense plan? Their apparent resistance to IDF attack comes more from the fact that their opponents were fighting with one hand tied behind their backs completely out of the style that they were best at fighting. Had the IDF <strong>really</strong> fought, thereÂ’s no doubt the outcome is going to be a quite different.<br><br>If the SAF really puts its chips down on the table, it certainly isnÂ’t going to be (I hope) anything like what the IDF did in 2006, which was a mess of restrictive policies, underestimation of the enemy, and no clear victory conditions.<br><br>And of course thereÂ’s the other side of the story, despite all their propaganda on how they were inflicting serious losses on the IDF and not taking any while the IDF were missing anything of tatical value and hitting civilians, the truth of the matter is that Hezbollah was actually taking a serious pounding, so much so that the entire thing was actually a massive military defeat, but a propaganda and media victor.<br><br>The loose accounting standards and organization of Hezbollah naturally allows them to cover up their losses and be creative about them, but the fact remains as a military threat following the events of 2006 they has been badly affected by their losses.<br><br>So I donÂ’t think the MAF is actually going to try to defend Johor ala. Hezbollah, for Hezbollah, beyond showing media savvy and playing on the IDF underestimating their capabilitiesÂ… is not really a model on how to defend stuff. And of course the SAF isnÂ’t exactly going to fight like the IDF did in 2006 as well.<br><br>So no, I donÂ’t think it will be a short war. Unless our commanders are so incompetent to have totally no strategic momentum in attacking Johor at all, any battle fought there will likely be of the conventional kind decided more by conventional strategies and tactics then restrictive and ambiguous politics.<br></div>

Something that hasn't been mentioned much here is how capable are we against our own tactics? Is the SAF willing to level the whole of Johore just to get rid of snipers, Anti-tank missile squads that hide in every corner of Johor? Even if we stick to the Highway, we are simply avoiding the battlefield and not taking our objectives. Moreover it's all fine and dandy to level an entire city, but it is another matter of quelling the population. We can take Johor but can we hold it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Army is organised into 4 area commands (divisions) numbering 1 to 4. Each division is commanded by a jeneral or mejar jeneral (Maj-Gen). 1st division is based in East Malaysia. The rest are in Peninsular or West Malaysia.<br><br>Each division comprises 3 brigades. Brigades number 1 to 12. Each brigade is commanded by a brig-jeneral (Brig-Gen). My understanding of allocation is as follows:<br><br>1st Division = 3, 5 and 9 Inf Bde<br>2nd Division = 2, 6 and 8 Inf Bde<br>3rd Division = 1 and 7 Inf Bde, 4 Mech Bde<br>4th Division = 11 and 12 Inf Bde, 10 Para Bde<br><br>Each brigade has a complement of approx 4,500 men.<br><br>Each Brigade normally comprises 3 regiments. Each regiment is normally commanded by a Kolonel or Lt Kol. Regiments are generally of 2 types, Regimen Ranger Diraja (or Royal Ranger Regiment) and Regimen Askar Melayu Diraja (or Royal Malay Regiment). Abbreviations are normally RRR and RAMD. Each Regimen are battalion sized formations and normally designated as Malbatt (or Malaysian battalion) in UN operations.<br><br>RRR number 1 to 10.

            <div class='col-md body'>The question is: Is there any other alternative if war really breaks out?<br><br>Certainly camping the SAF in mainland Singapore won't be a viable option in the long run, and it will be a war fought on the opponent's terms, not to mention at their leisure. We certainly lack the sheer air and naval power alone to win any war if your opponent is in it to the bitter end to see your destruction or collapse at the end of the day.<br><br>In that kind of scenario, it would make no sense to turn Singapore in a Stalingrad for by all measures if it has become like that then Singapore would have already lost the war as a nation.<br><br>If our economies cannot function, supplies are cut off, and we are forced to fight with absolutely nowhere to fall back on it would only be a matter of time before collapse will happen. While such a battle might be costly for any invader, the fact is at the end of the day they will still be standing and probably in procession of the land. We on the other hand, would have quite effectively ceased to exist as a free people.<br><br>A static, turning Singapore-into-Stalingrad kind of war is exactly the kind of war the SAF was not designed to fight. It completely removes all initiative on our part, obliterates our combined arms ability (which is perhaps one of the key areas we hold a significant edge in the region), as well as wastes much of the intelligence gathering and other war fighting technologies we have that would be the most useful in an offensive situation.<br><br>This is not to mention the capability of the SAF to resist will decrease sharply with every vital area or advance the invader makes that overruns a vital base or airfield. At the end of the day you canÂ’t ensure air or naval superiority if your very own land is threatened.<br><br>So if our country becomes Stalingrad, the battle is already half-lost and the conclusion will simply be a matter of time. Our only hope would then be that the enemy would lose heart from their serious losses and perhaps back offÂ… but then they still have plenty of cards on the table like a blockade or suing for peace on terms that are very favorable to them.<br><br>If they are a radical foe that intends nothing less then the ultimate occupation of Singapore, then good luck to us if we intend to fight Stalingrad style.<br><br>So I have to disagree, if we are at war the best option would be to take the offensive, instead of letting them come to us. Letting them come to us would be a suicidal option given we have virtually no strategic depth.<br><br>Note that the vital deterrence ability of the SAF comes from its reputation of being a credible offensive force in the region, that is, if we were only a defensive force that goes for the minimum best outcome in conflict then other nations would have no qualms about pushing us around as long as they stop short of a total invasion.<br><br>So unless somebody else has a better idea on what to do when the stuff hits the fan, (for which I would gladly take it over the forward offensive strategy) I do not think a static, turning Singapore in Stalingrad approach is appropriate as an alternative survival strategy.<br><br>At best it is only a fail deadly, and one that might not even deter an aggressor determined enough to see our ruin.<br><br>If Israel fought with the that idea they would almost certainly not exist today.<br><br>For our case I believe it's almost always better to spill blood for their land then for ours.<br></div>
