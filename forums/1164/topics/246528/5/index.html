All our patriotic feeling aside it is apparent that more or less it is a level fight which will ultimately boil down to which side makes the smart moves and which side makes the blunders- which is something quite remarkable (at the risk of sounding patriotic) for the little red dot because you must consider the vast size disparity between the two nations in question.<br><br>The MAF certainly isnÂ’t going to sit around and do nothing while the SAF preps for a possible forward defence, and over the years they have done a decent job of coming up with a credible challenge to this most obvious of SAF strategies. The SAF on the other hand, has also taken steps to make sure that this strategy is still a credible deterrence, and hence the balance of power is maintained.<br><br>I think when it comes down to it, itÂ’s tough to say based on the general quality of troops and equipment which side will emerge with the upper hand. It really boils down to the way the war is fought and which sideÂ’s commander makes the fatal error or brilliant move.<br><br>Is the average SAF conscript really far behind the average MAF soldier in terms of quality? I doubt so. As I have said before and will say again, I think our boys can give a fight when it comes down to it, as they have proven time and time again to other nations in exercises. And the certain Malaysians who promote the "predator race" theory are welcome to ignore this at their own peril just as the Japanese and Germans did in WW2... in any case sterotyping your opponent is already a strategic  mistake of sorts.<br><br>Are the MAF really that far behind in terms of equipment? I think they have a credible answer to most of our systems. While the SAF maintains a quality overmatch, it is certainly not in terms of M1A1 Abrams vs. SaddamÂ’s stripped down 10-Camels-a-tank T-72s.<br><br>So in the end it boils down to how you fight the war, and perhaps the SAF still has a question to answer on its own part: can the scholar generals really make the proper choices when it comes down to it or will they treat war like one game of C&amp;C?<br></div></blockquote>Well yes, of course. But the entire war will get bogged down to an urban warfare scenario, and we don't quite have the armour to deal with that just yet unless the SAF does turn the Leopard 2s we will get into urban warfare models, which is quite likely since MBTs of that size are restricted to largely open land.<br><br>In an urban warfare scenario, I would be hesitant to charge in even if we have the numbers as things could turn into Pyrrhic victories if we don't watch it. No sense wasting an army, winning a battle and loosing the war at the same time. Just looking at the Israeli performance is enough to give any reasonably competent commander some pause.<br><br>Surely we have counter battery fire that could neutralise arty fire? Do the Malaysians have that sort of thing at the moment? We could also look into UAVs which I would dare say be very useful for such a scenario.</div>
