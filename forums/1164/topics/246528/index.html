            <div class='col-md body'>If we are coming in, 2-3days or even less is enough to advance deep up north. Some of our forces are expected to `fly' deep into Matland. How they do it is a patented secret.<br><br>It is a totally different scenario when you are talking about a full-fledge war as compared to a guerilla insurrection like the one with communists. The SAF maintains the capability to completely push back the clock counters in Matland by decades. You are talking about a dysfunctional or perhaps non-existant economy, abandoned cities, a hobbled or non-existant military, starving people and decades for recovery; let alone being left behind by the world.<br><br>Any notion of a united resistant is untenable. It may appear early on but will disappear soon enough. To the contrary, you will see different groups coming forward from time to time and some disappearing later and mostly at odds at one another. It would be good for Singapore to plant the seeds of hatred among such groups and cultivate some. The entity called Matland would simply vanish. This is a scenario that keeps repeating time and time again in various places around the world. Anyway, Matland is not united in the first place in spite of the ultra-Umno princes' claims that they are. The fault lines are easily discernible.<br><br>And yes, the incumbent MATland government(with whatever little power and authority they have left)will sue for peace. Otherwise, whatever credibility they have would vaporize. And groups hungry for power will take over.<br><br>Singapore would plausibly be hurt in the process but as mentioned by many others, this is a last resort when confronted with certain doom. The best thing to do of out of a bad scenario. The important thing is that singapore would survive. And yes, Singapore can hold on to the occupied territories for a long time indeed; much to the sufferance to the conquered people. Something that many will find acceptable when survivability is at stake.</div>
