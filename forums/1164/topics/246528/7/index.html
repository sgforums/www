It is the same as the deterrent concept - do not step on my tail or strangle my neck because the end result will be deadly, deadly for the enemy but not necessarily so for the cobra.<br><br>A cobra does not hesitate to take the 1st striking move when threaten. The attack will be of course, swift and decisive. It dares.</div></blockquote>I think the best defence is for any political government who initiate the attack will be political sucide as such they will also think twice about having such thought.<br><br>As for the para drop, I was thinking of a senario if SAF push to the north. And TNI para drop into JB to cut off supply on our forces into KL and at the same time make a push into Singapore from the south.  SAF would be having triple front.<br><br>So i thought about securing southern island prior to moving northward. TNI does not have enough equipment to ferry asset across it needs stagging island.<br><br>what are your thoughts?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The question is if the Indons have sufficent resources to mount a feasible air drop behind enemy lines that can be of strategic consideration. Given their current troop lift capacity, I am not sure it is possible.<br><br>Remember they have to get past the RSAF as well, which is a very big question in itself. And even if they land they will basically be cut off, and be forced to fight infantry-level with no support whatsoever. Unless the SAF was really foolish enough to devote ALL of its resources pushing up north, any attempt to open up a third front by dropping behind the SAFÂ’s lines will probably end in disaster for them.<br><br>Unless of course, they are willing to sacrifice their troops simply to tie down the SAF, but I think of all their options this is not the best.<br><br>A more feasible option would be for them to deploy via airlift and sealift to join MAF forces on the other side of the front.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone know what sort of ammunition the M'sians got for their tanks? I have been reading things like Saddamn's army had things like steel rods for APFSDS ammunition, and given that the Russians in the past retained their best tech for themselves, and still do an extent today, what did the Poles sell the M'sias? Some weak tungsten round?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For some reason Saddam's tankers used inexpensive stainless steel training sabots that were completely ineffective against the M1A1s in the Gulf War. But of course they might have thrown some real stuff downrange as well, but not that it would have helped anyway.<br><br>It is a moot point given even if they were using the proper APFSDS ammo,  the 3VBM8/3BM17/18, they stood no chance of penetrating the frontal arc of the Abrams within a 60 degree arc at any range, though the Yanks had this policy of standing back beyond 500 meters just to be safe and use their superior gunnery to finish the Iraqi tanks off.<br><br>But of course, there's no reason to think (and indeed it would be an error to do so) that the Malaysian PT-91s are anything like Saddam's 10-camels a tank monkey model T-72s... they probably got their tanks along with some proper APFSDS ammo to shoot with.<br><br>On paper at least, our Leo2A4s should be invulnerable to export 125mm smoothbore ammo ala. 3VBM8/3BM17/18 given they donÂ’t do very well against modern protection packages.<br><br>But if the MAF had gotten hold of 3VBM19/3BM42M(3BM44M) standard kind of ammo there might be a possibility of penetration, and certainly so if they used the very latest kind of Russian penetrators that can supposedly penetrate over 800mm RHA. So right now its all speculation.<br><br>On the other hand, our L44 should be able punch through their Twardies even if we used the old APFSDS ammo no matter what armour package they pack, unless of course they have somehow gotten hold of Kontakt-5 style ERA that can defeat APFSDS rounds. And of course if we were using the very latest 120mm APFSDS rounds it is quite possible there is nothing the Twardie does that will avoid penetration.<br><br>Of course there are other things to consider as well beyond guns, armour and ammo... your fire control system, ability to lay your gun on target, as well as damage control abilities go a long way into determining a tank battle. No matter how you redesign the T-72, the issue of it going up like a firework even after minor penetration that is survivable in other MBTs is going to be an issue MAF tankers have to face.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, if the Malaysians are using the Erawa reactive armour that ships with the Twardie, then the L44 APFSDS will have no issues with it. They just have to avoid getting shot.<br><br>In any case it's not really a fair match to try to draw both tanks beside each other, given they are from different generations. The Leo2A4 is unquestionably the superior MBT as even the Poles have said so themselves.<br><br>In the end it boils down to the user.<br><br>I suspected that the MAF got the Twardies as an answer to our *ahem* MBTs... then we simply upgraded our MBTs to leapfrog their capabilities.</div>
