            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>hhmm...lets develop a more complex view for discussion sake ..Lets see......<br><br>We may not be able to get element of surprise.<br><br>first we are small island so lack of depth to hide if we enmass forces chances is that enemy will know. If we fly, southern island early warning system will detect. So to over come the element of surprise. You need elite forces to blow up what needs to be blow up. You need some troops to be in these island so that whatever forces in the island will not post a threat to mainland sing. </blockquote>Let`s develope this further..urm..and add a bit of logic to it. The closeness of countries in this region means that surprise is something they would have to dispense with. Speed means more. And in that regard, we can certainly mobilise faster than any of the countries here. Much much faster. Since you must certainly have been in the SAF, you will know the time which we would need to mobilize to start moving north.<br><br><blockquote><br>Before moving northward you need to content with the south. It is reasonable to assume that 3rd party will parachute to JB to support its friends. Done it before on our national day.<br><br>It is also reasonable to assume that we need to protect southern flank before pushing north. So you would need Navy to block the south to prevent reinforcement.<br></blockquote>Let`s see what have we got. Will the southern flank be unprotected? Obviously not. Can the navy prevent a southern invasion assuming they(Indons) have the capability to invade(transport) in the first place(which they dont) while supporting the northward thrust. The answer is a resounding `yes'.<br><br>And to tell you the truth, it is not reasonable to assume that Indonesia would assist Malaysia in an event of a conflict.  I do not discount the possibility of some fanatical groups in Indonesia using the event to rally thier cause. But for a 3rd party to go to war for another country`s sake is another matter? For starters, there is not even a treaty or alliance between the two countries. In fact, there are friction and suspicion between the two as far as territories are concerned. The other question which begs to be answered is whether Indonesia has the capability and resources to go to war. Answer:No. This would be sacrificing decades of growth.<br><br>Further, we saying that indonesia would get involve is tantamount to saying the US would get involve and we all know how that will end.<br><br><blockquote><br>While all these are happening. RSAF will be contented with Migs29, Hawk, SU30. with R-77 (that is if they are maintained and trained) to gain air superior in the first day of war. hopfully they expand their R-77 to our F-5 and not on our F-16. If they will try to take out our airborne early warning. That will be devastated as first see first Kill will be out. </blockquote>Now, this does not make sense. The RSAF has more jets than both two countries combined. Secondly, just about how many equipment can they surge at a moment`s notice given thier smallish air-forces and poor maintanence. We only have ten fingers. For example, can Malaysia put all 8 hornets in the air at a moment`s notice. Again, the answer is a no.<br><br>Up till now, the RMAF is not known to possess the R-77 yet. Secondly, the Russians are known to up the ante on the actual capabilities of thier equipment. This is as opposed to the Americans who prefer to state actual performance and with combat experience to boot. Just look at the development cycle of the Amraam.<br><br>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">`mothballed'</span> Migs do not carry R-77 without modifications. The Hawk <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trainers </span>definitely do not carry R-77s. The same goes for the Hornets. It will be a turkey shoot if the RMAF goes up against the RSAF.<br><br>And why on earth would a fighter jet see an AEW/AWACs aircraft first? The latter won`t be flying alone. And they will be guiding other friendly jets in the skies as well.<br><br><blockquote><br>while all these are happening, Astros will be raining down on our enmass forces given that they might already know where we hide. But we might not be able to take out their astros because it is beyond our artillary range. What is left is our air forces to conduct search and destroy their launches. [quote]</blockquote>Ah..another one of the ridiculous Astross argument. Why? For lack any better points or more accurately equipment I suppose.  The Astross cannot be used as an element of surprise. You would need to mobilize the rest of the armed forces first so there goes the surprise and since Singapore mobilizes faster than you can group your forces, the Astross would be long gone since. The Singaporean invasion would already have started. Imagine driving your Astross within range and firing without mobilizing the MAF. Does not make sense does it? The RSAF would be destroying any and every critical element of the MAF at the mere sign of war.<br><br>And why on earth would we be using artillery to take out artillery when we have other long range weapons? In the first place, the Malaysian Astross rockets are &lt;40 km. And what are hardened bases, hangars, etc for? To protect critical equipment. Today`s military runaways can be removed and replaced in no time. Lastly, I need not stress more. These are rockets and not pin-point accurate missiles.<br><br><blockquote><br>In the mids of all these activities you need to launch D-day style seaborne assult on the north.<br><br>You think SAF command and logistics is strong enough to support 2 front?<br>once element of suprise is gone i think it will take more than 6 days to wrap up.<br></blockquote>Why would it be a D-day style seaborne assault? Just hop to the straits of Johor or take a look at the map. That river can be crossed in no time. And with Singapore controlling the air, there will be minimum resistance as well.<br><br>I have already answered your point about having a two front war. Anyway, you have unwittingly summed up the main issue here. The MAF is totally out-gunned and out-numbered that the only viable scenario would be for it to drag someone else into its war with Singapore. So, thank you very much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, countries have been known to go to war over the slightest things. And there are things that might lead to limited armed conflict that might, or might not boil over to a full out conflict.<br><br>But maybe the old, massive spark of hostilities scenario might be a tad simplistic, and somewhat more in the lines of what we expect to see in the Middle East with the Arab league versus Israel. To spark off a war in that way right here involves needing to cut off a lot of business ties, as well as several other bilateral pacts before things can rally get down to the tooth and nail, and quite suddenly as well.<br><br>However canÂ’t discount the possibility that a radical regime might take over our neighbours, so never say never.<br><br>My speculation would be that both nations are going to take several hits if a conflict ever breaks out. I do not think Malaysia would waste its ASTROs barrages indiscriminately on Singaporean civilian targets in the opening hours of the conflict (considering the lifespan of the launchers after they have expended their munitions could be measured in minutes), so the SAF will be bearing the brunt of the steel rain.<br><br>The MAF priority of course, would be to disable the RSAF with their arty as much as they can while the SAFÂ’s notion would be to counter battery and support the SAF advance as well.<br><br>If there was enough time for tensions to build up, the MAF would have mobilized forces to defend Johor in depth, so there will be no easy landing for the SAF there. On the other hand it puts their forces in range of SG arty. If it was a race to get mobilized (in the event of sudden hostilities), then most likely the Malaysians will have to concede Johor.<br><br>The SAF priority would obviously be to capture Johor first, and then push up as far as their resources will allow. On how this will turn out will be a matter of speculation as it will depend on the tactical brilliance and overall strategy of both sides. The MAF priority would be to contain the SAF, and inflict as much damage to SingaporeÂ’s economy and the like as much as possible as prolonged conflict would be much less acceptable to the island state then Malaysia.<br><br>So we donÂ’t really know how itÂ’ll turn out. All we can say that given our equipment and training, with a fair amount of smart fighting the Malaysians obviously have a serious potential foe to worry about if the stuff ever hits the fan, and of course the MAF are no easy meat either.<br><br>So all in all I would rather we not start anything stupid at all.<br><br>But can sum it up as this:<br><br>SAF priority:<br><br>Utilitize technological and force advantage to capture Johor and establish foothold in Southern Malaysia, limit damage to the main island and try to get the opponent to sue for peace.<br><br>MAF priority:<br><br>Contain the SAF, neutralize  and draw the conflict out to a war of attrition. Neutralize SAF technological and force advantage through use of terrain and asymmetrical tactics.<br><br>OF course you fight to win for your side, but this is how all the cards are laid out I suppose.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To start a war bet MY &amp; SG is as simple as Turning of the water tap off.<br>We still have two Water Treaty which end in 2011 &amp; 2061. IRRC.<br><br>Can our top commanders stay calm in the event of war? Can they really lead?<br>People reacts differently when the 1st bullet flys pass.<br>What if SAF's plan did not go on as smoothly as they've expect? High casualties in the opening days? Can our Commanders still keep their composure &amp; think properly? Or just send in more men blindly &amp; get them killed?<br><br>Why i asked these?<br>Becos i've such Commander in my reservist unit.<br>During our excerise(luckily only an excerise), When the fighting starts, &amp; one of our defensive post was overrun, he just ordered all men from other posts to reinforce, all of us were sent directly into the fighting zone w/o proper identify the positions of our enemies. One by one, each section &amp; platoon, were KIA.<br>Meanwhile leaving the other flanks wide open for enemy to just walk into the command post. My commander was lost after 1/3 of his men is KIA, he just stare blindly &amp; didnt know what to do.<br><br>To note: My section was ordered to charge in, w/o knowing where the enemies were, imagine my entire section proned down just infront of the enemy's front line.. hahaha... 'killed' instantly w/o firing a shot. Same goes to other most other sections.<br><br>We may have the best equipments, but are we prepared mentally &amp; are our commanders competent? None of them have real combat experience &amp; seen his men died. The sight of war may just scare the hell out of some of them.<br><br>This really worry me a lot.<br></div>

Each division is commanded by a jeneral or mejar jeneral (Maj-Gen). 1st division is based in East Malaysia. The rest are in Peninsular or West Malaysia.<br><br>Each division comprises 3 brigades. Brigades number 1 to 12. Each brigade is commanded by a brig-jeneral (Brig-Gen). My understanding of allocation is as follows:<br><br>1st Division = 3, 5 and 9 Inf Bde<br>2nd Division = 2, 6 and 8 Inf Bde<br>3rd Division = 1 and 7 Inf Bde, 4 Mech Bde<br>4th Division = 11 and 12 Inf Bde, 10 Para Bde<br><br>Each brigade has a complement of approx 4,500 men.<br><br>Each Brigade normally comprises 3 regiments. Each regiment is normally commanded by a Kolonel or Lt Kol. Regiments are generally of 2 types, Regimen Ranger Diraja (or Royal Ranger Regiment) and Regimen Askar Melayu Diraja (or Royal Malay Regiment). Abbreviations are normally RRR and RAMD. Each Regimen are battalion sized formations and normally designated as Malbatt (or Malaysian battalion) in UN operations.<br><br>RRR number 1 to 10. RAMD number 1 to 25.<br><br>4 Mech Bde comprises 7 RRR, 12 and 19 RAMD all of which are mechanised.<br><br>10 Para Bde comprises 8 RRR, 9 and 17 RAMD all of which are para formations.<br><br>There are also 3 groups (regiment-sized) of special forces. These number 11, 21 and 22. Groups are known as Grup Gerak Khas (or Special Forces groups). I think there is also a Pasukan Khas Laut (Abbr: Paskal) which is a special naval force. There is also a Regimen TUDM under the air force.<br><br>There are 5 Armor regiments belonging to the Korp Armor Diraja or Royal Armour Corp. Regiment numbers 1 to 4 and 11. 1 KAD is assigned to 4 Mech Bde. A separate squadron 1 (subset of regimen) comprising Scorpion ACV is assigned to 10 Para Bde.<br><br>There are also 16 Artillery regiments. Regimens are known as regimen artillery diraja or Royal Artillery regiments. Each regiment is believed have 3 Batteries. Assumed to be split between 2 Med Arty, 7 Fld Arty, 1 MRL, 4 AD, 1 Arty loc and 1 UAV. Identified numbers include 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 21, 22, 31, 32, 34 and 51. 51 RAD is assigned the Astros MRL and is also believed to be assigned to 3 Div at Gemas. The 155mm G5 is believed to be assigned to 21 and 22 RAD. 31 RAD is believed to be assigned the Banshee 400 UAV. 34 RAD is believed to be assigned the Jernas.<br><br>Reserves are known as Regimen Askar Wataniah (or Territorial Army regiments). These are segregated into 300 and 500 series regimens. 500 series regimen number 501 to 516. There is normally 1 per state except for Sarawak and Sabah which have 2. Series 300 numbers start from 301. There was supposed to be some reorg of AW regiments.<br><br>The army is supported by several other corps such as the signal corp and has an army air wing (A109H and Mi17s).<br><br>Principal equipment are as follows:<br><br>ACV: 48 PT91M (w 28 tank transporters), 26 Scorpions, 186 Sibmas, 140 AML60/90s and 92 Ferrets.<br><br>APC/MICV (incl non-combat variants): 111 KIFV, 211 Adnan, 184 V100/150, 25 Stormer, 452 Condor, 37 M3<br><br>Arty (non-AA): 130-200 105mm Model 56, 12 FH70s, 28 G5 Mk 3, 18 Astros and 81mm mortars. 18 L119s 105mm (not confirmed)<br><br>ATGW: Eryx, Baktar Shikens, Metis-M RPG7s, Carl Gustav and RCL.

And there are things that might lead to limited armed conflict that might, or might not boil over to a full out conflict. </blockquote>agree.<br><br><blockquote>But maybe the old, massive spark of hostilities scenario might be a tad simplistic, and somewhat more in the lines of what we expect to see in the Middle East with the Arab league versus Israel. To spark off a war in that way right here involves needing to cut off a lot of business ties, as well as several other bilateral pacts before things can rally get down to the tooth and nail, and quite suddenly as well. </blockquote>agree<br><br><blockquote>However canÂ’t discount the possibility that a radical regime might take over our neighbours, so never say never. </blockquote>if that happen there would be less possibality of war with them because they would definately eradicate the radical first, either by conducting another COIN or civil war. Either way they will win as they did with the comunist. Come to think of it we probably will came and help them fighting the radical  instead of fighting them.<br><br><blockquote>My speculation would be that both nations are going to take several hits if a conflict ever breaks out. I do not think Malaysia would waste its ASTROs barrages indiscriminately on Singaporean civilian targets in the opening hours of the conflict (considering the lifespan of the launchers after they have expended their munitions could be measured in minutes), so the SAF will be bearing the brunt of the steel rain. </blockquote>there were a lot of artillery and from my experience with their army they know how to use it and utillies the geographical advantage to evade our jet. The serbs have done that with the american. and i have confirmation that MAF change their doctrine when they learned how the serbs spoof allied air superiority.<br><br><blockquote>The MAF priority of course, would be to disable the RSAF with their arty as much as they can while the SAFÂ’s notion would be to counter battery and support the SAF advance as well. </blockquote>agree<br><br><blockquote>If there was enough time for tensions to build up, the MAF would have mobilized forces to defend Johor in depth, so there will be no easy landing for the SAF there. On the other hand it puts their forces in range of SG arty. If it was a race to get mobilized (in the event of sudden hostilities), then most likely the Malaysians will have to concede Johor. </blockquote>try to read some of their so called 'quick march test' competition or the brigade level 'offroad challenge', you can see that they able to march the entire brigade in two days all the way from kelantan to johor with minimal damage to their equipment..... inside the cover of the jungle.<br><br><blockquote>The SAF priority would obviously be to capture Johor first, and then push up as far as their resources will allow. On how this will turn out will be a matter of speculation as it will depend on the tactical brilliance and overall strategy of both sides. The MAF priority would be to contain the SAF, and inflict as much damage to SingaporeÂ’s economy and the like as much as possible as prolonged conflict would be much less acceptable to the island state then Malaysia. </blockquote>agree<br><br><blockquote>So we donÂ’t really know how itÂ’ll turn out. All we can say that given our equipment and training, with a fair amount of smart fighting the Malaysians obviously have a serious potential foe to worry about if the stuff ever hits the fan, and of course the MAF are no easy meat either. </blockquote>ive seen their training. Lets just keep the battle in the air ok.<br><br><blockquote>So all in all I would rather we not start anything stupid at all. </blockquote>agree<br><br><blockquote>SAF priority:<br><br>Utilitize technological and force advantage to capture Johor and establish foothold in Southern Malaysia, limit damage to the main island and try to get the opponent to sue for peace. </blockquote>try to completely destroyed an important strategic asset such as refinery and threatened to destroy other strategic asset, they might negotiate (i doubt it)<br><br><blockquote>MAF priority:<br><br>Contain the SAF, neutralize and draw the conflict out to a war of attrition. Neutralize SAF technological and force advantage through use of terrain and asymmetrical tactics.</blockquote>if we learned enough geography we will know that its a defender heaven. Too many small hills and dense secondary jungle a perfect ambush country.... and seing the way our SAF climb hills during an attack.....<br><br><blockquote>OF course you fight to win for your side, but this is how all the cards are laid out I suppose. </blockquote>ofcourse<br><br>we dont have to do an invasion at all. maybe just ocupied JB (its an urban jungle, an advantage to us) and use the air force to destroy strategic target and force negotiation.
