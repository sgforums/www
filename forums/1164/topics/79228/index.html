However, over the years, we have become a Fortress Singapore. See this thread: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76149" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=76149</a> Huxley pointed out that the strength of our civil defence force, provision of air raid shelters, hardening of key assets like ammo depots and aircraft shelters and now, Newater, allows Singapore to absorb a first strike before retailating. This is also a good thing in that it allows more room for diplomatic solutions of crises. If you know that your country will not be wiped out in a first strike, there is a lesser temptation to preempt your enemy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another point to add: preemption cuts both ways. The 1973 Yom Kippur War is an excellent example. Even the mighty Israel was surprised by the sudden strikes of the Arab armies and at one point, the leadership even had to put their nuclear forces on standby. I guess the reason is because the IDF is based largely on reserves and the Arab armies on active units. Hence, ironically, the Arab countries can pre-empt Israel better since they can mobilize their forces with speed and stealth whereas Israel cannot. So, the 1973 war demonstrated that a surprise attack on a country with little strategic depth may very well succeed.<br><br></div>

However, they also seal the fate of diplomatic solutions. Imagine if Kennedy had authorized air strikes on the Cuban missiles in 1962 (as many people advocate since the missiles were about to become operational), the world might have descended into nuclear war. Guess whether to undertake a first strike depends on assessing your opponent's intentions. Before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, there were also talks between the two countries to resolve their problems but Saddam was massing his troops along the border already.</div>

Both side will monitor closely the "number" that is building up like manpower, equipment etc etc...<br><br>Singapore will not let the 1st strike take place within our land. No we will not. The moment the number hit our "mark" Sorry "Ah Bang" you are going to get it.<br><br>Singapore will fight from outside of her home and will hold on as long till help come.(This was back in late 80s and 90s) Today from what I look at it, we will stay there for good.<br><br>Manpower will never be an issue.
