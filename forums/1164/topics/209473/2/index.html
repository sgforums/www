            <div class='col-md body'>Upgrading of RSAF Skyhawk was done is two stages over quite a period of time. First was engine upgrade and second was avionics upgrade. The Skyhawks were with us for quite a while - the life cycle cost must have been pretty low - good value for money. This is quite an achievement  considering we received " bare bones " A4s in the beginning &amp; we had about 70 operational aircraft at its peak.They probably have been more than good in their role as "mud movers " - CAS.<br><br>Scrapping them was the right move as they are well past their prime and have served their purpose.  The " mud movers"  job now belongs to the RSAF 's Apache AH64 Ds and perhaps F16s.<br><br>I reckon the transitions were well thought out and planned which is difficult to replicate even in some  first world air forces - look at the RAF and RAAF.</div>

IIRC it was not AMRAAM, but either AIM-7 or-9. Besides, the Hornet is basically a swing-role aircraft. RMAF's Hornets might not be as effective as an AMRAAM toting Bug, but it can still perform air-to-air mission without much trouble.</div>
