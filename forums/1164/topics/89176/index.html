Any denotation elsewhere in building with resultant vibration and smoke could cause chain reaction.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hand grenades are fantastic for making cheap booby traps quickly that can be impossible to safely defuse.<br><br>I'm sure you all know about the trip wire booby trap that's basically a primed grenade (safety pin removed) and placed inside a tin can that's fits the grenade just snug enough to hold the lever in place? The wire is usually hidden in the grass so it is impossible to see. When you kick the wire the grenade is pulled out of the can and the lever drops away and the grenade explodes after a few seconds.<br><br>Only US-style grenades can be used and the Chinese stick grenades are not very practicable for booby-trap usage.<br><br>But there are other cheaper and faster ways to deploy the grenade as a booby trap made popular by the Vietcong.<br><br>Effective booby-trapping is not only dependent on placement but also on timing. Booby traps placed too randomly for too long is both a waste and a danger to civi or your own forces.<br><br>One of the best time to put a booby-trap is when you are trying to cover your retreat. It has a higher chance of causing enemy casualties or at least slow down their pursuit of you.<br><br>But when retreating you only have time to make very quick simple booby traps.<br><br>So if you already have grenade-in-a-can traps set along the pre-designated path of your retreat, all you need to do is to go to each one and prime (remove safety pin) the grenades and slide them back into the cans.<br><br>Another thing VC would usually do after retreating is intended for the enemy moving in to occupy your territory. One popular thing is to booby trap fallen comrades by simply putting a primed grenade under their dead bodies. Or simply placed under anything that the Americans would lift up to examine etc. It could be under a box, a radio or anything.<br><br>In a rubble strewn area you can simply place it under one end of a plank or anything that will easily shift when disturbed so that the primed grenade rolls out and explode. The grenade in a can can be easily applied to doors and windows. A bit of imagination goes a long way.<br><br>My all-time favourite booby-trap is the one the Israelis made from a mobile phone. This is early days so the mobile phone is probably the brick-sized ones. They placed a small explosive in it and Mossad managed somehow to pass it on to their intended terrrorist target.<br><br>Once he got it the Israelis called to confirm if the person on the other line is indeed the terrorist himself. Once confirmed they detonated the explosive remotely.<br><br>They even video-taped the whole thing from below the apartment where the terrorist was hiding. From the tape we saw a bright flash and a bang behind the drawn blinds.</div>
