            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the Arjun has a weight problem (which was made known in established military mag eg Janes)</blockquote>My dear friend, The Arjun is a heavy tank, Janes must have written articles about its heavy weight, but it is not for Janes to decide how much weight the tank can have or not. It is for the IA to decide whether the tank is acceptable to them or not. If going by the weight statistics the U.S army must have rejected the M1A1 and the further variants.<br><br><blockquote>please do not let your 'patriotic Indian sentiments' cloud/deflect the issue/criticisms here</blockquote>Never, we must not just argue blindly and try to criticise a tank or anyother product unwantly. I had said that there were problems regarding the Arjun's durng the development phase. A lot of them. But they are all solved, the Army has accepted them and today the Arjun's are rolling out of the Avadi factory.<br><br><blockquote>Most of us, I believe, have no access to these new Indian military hardware gems and therefore, the points raised are based on what we read in mags. </blockquote>Exactly, the Indian media is very ignorant about the defence sector. They did not have access to information or press releases on what is happening and if they did not get any info for a long time, they sit to write their own stories of which most will be negative.<br><br><blockquote>the Arjun is nothin if it cannot hold its own &amp; defeat the proliferation of Chinese-made tanks by your ....you know who . </blockquote>Yes, i know, that's the main reason for going for the T-90 tanks. And at that time (during which the said state went to purchse the T-80) the Arjun had problems like Engine overheating, FCS not working properly etc. So they went for the T-90's<br><br>The current strategy is for this two tanks i.e the Arjun and T-90's to be inducted. The Arjun will be there to punch and to take hits from the T-80's.<br>This is a shift in our strategy. I think we are moving towards a stategy similar to the U.S. We cannot afford to lose our tank man in a war. Survivability is a very important issue. Tanks can be made and if they survive they can fight again and knock out more enemy tanks.</div>

When u have a new,weapon,u must see whether u have the facilities and logistic to support,see whether yr weapons fit the environment it is going to fight on it! WOW Like what u means, 100tons also no problem loh? Yr army can support? The terrain can take it? Yr own country transport facilites can handle it? I tell u India is not prepare for a 58.5tons monster!!! They r making a things which they cannot handle! USA has modern facilities and all the neccessary equipment to support their 72tons M1A2 monster but if their tank comes to tropical,it will be useless...hehehe...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by RAMBO29:<br>2)Acquisition of T-90<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">iversification of Army rather than concentrating on a single variety.All the tanks in IA will be modified as per use like Indian T-90's can fire missiles which original ones cannot..</blockquote>One conclusion,T-90 is more suitable in India<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by RAMBO29<br>Arjun is an extremely good tank.There were initial problems with a few systems.Mainly the reason being the need to have a tank that can with stand Nuclear,Biological and Chemical Warfare at all terrains and climates from -30 degree to 60 degrees.Most of that are solved now and ready for mass production...</blockquote>I though those r basic requirement of most NORMAL tank? Nothing special. Mass production? My Foot!!!<br><br></div>

India is a vast land with varitey of geographical features. Desets, plains, mountains and jungles, marshlands etc. No one is going to fight a tank battle in the marshlands. Most of the western border areas are suitable for  tank warfare except in the northeast where the himalaya is. Forget about tanks the chance for battle in these areas are limited because of extreme heights and the low temperature.<br><br><blockquote>One conclusion,T-90 is more suitable in India </blockquote>It is true that the T-90 is a nice tank.<br><br><blockquote>My Foot!!! </blockquote>Why Arjun over your feet? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
