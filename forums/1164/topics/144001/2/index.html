            <div class='col-md body'>Just my opinion , the main cost of today tank is vehtronics not the vehicle itself.<br><br>For LT to cost abt USD7mil per unit, I believe you are talking a lot of latest technology, for example thermal imaging, autotracking, BMS,perhaps even hybrid electrical/diesel engine.<br><br>As for modern MBT, nowaday easily cost USD10mil or more , so it is not cheap anymore.<br><br>The thing is , do we need such a high tech stuff in our new LT just for fire support and secondary anti tank role???<br><br>No , we don't. I think a cost of USD3mil to 5mil should be sufficient. In fact we should take our time getting those new LT in, say 50 units per year, and we could upgrade them with high tech stuff later when it is necessary or the price is right, becos at the moment, the current threats are not that high anyway.<br><br>But we do need to have new LT, becos the need is there, firstly those SM1 is already very old, it is not as reliable, in fact , I believe they should replace them in 80s instead of upgraded them in the first place, secondly it is no more offered sufficient protection against new threat like 25mm cannon which will be very common in the near future.<br><br>As for NGF, it is something that we must have, to maintian the quality edge over our closer rival, a small initial number is fine becos we still hold the edge of having Awacs and the best WVR &amp; BVR weapon, our rival at the moment cannot afford to have large qty of high tech a/c anyway.<br><br>As for new subs, the Viking program itself could be scrapped, and even it is not , we talking abt something after 2012 at least, so it is still too early to talk abt Viking subs.<br><br>As for the offer of 2 subs from Sweden, they are talking abt the Vastergotland class , Swedish is downsizing their subs fleet, therefore 2 of the 4 Vastergotland class subs are going for "early retirement" and have been offered to us.<br><br>The other 2 boats , Swedish Navy have upgraded them with AIP etc and renamed as the Sodermanland class .<br><br>If we take up the offer, we will most likely go for the same upgrades , which mean we will have the first AIP boats in SEA.<br>( MY's two Scorpene are non AIP, Indon may get another 2 U209s, total 4 U209s, Thailand at the moment are looking at purchasing 2 old Israeli Gal boats)<br><br>So getting the two Sodermanland class is certainly not downgrading , in fact it will be the most stealthy boats in SEA!!!<br><br></div>

Between the 2 heli, technological about the same except S70B is a bigger heli with better range, load and wider scope of mission.<br><br>The training aircraft that RSAF interested should be the PC-21 from swiss.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by ah_kwang:<br><strong>Singapore revives naval helicopter competition<br><br>Singapore has issued a revised tender for six naval helicopters in a newly reduced configuration, restarting a procurement delayed two years by budget constraints, writes Brendan Sobie.<br><br>Eurocopter, NH Industries and Sikorsky received a new invitation to tender late last month and have until 1 June to respond with bids for the AS532C Cougar, NH90 and S-70, respectively, say industry sources.<br><br>The three manufacturers, originally shortlisted in 2001, submitted a second round of bids late last year. But Singapore let the bids expire at the end of March without selecting a winner, presumably because all three exceeded the budget.<br><br>[b]Sources say Singapore, in an attempt to curb costs, has reduced the capability and quantity of sensors and weapons to be installed on the helicopters. Singapore is also requesting only four helicopters to be delivered fully equipped, with options to buy additional equipment for the other two later.</strong><br><br>In previous tenders Singapore asked for costings on six to eight fully equipped helicopters for six new frigates to be delivered from 2005. The new bids will be valid through 31 March 2005, suggesting a contract by the end of the current fiscal year.<br><br><strong> Sorry to bring up this old topic about our naval helios. But it's the first time I saw this article from flight international about the reduced capability. Seems quite unlikely that Mindef has budget problems. Brings me to think whether will our NGF's capability be compromised, hopefully not. If not we won't be able to fully exploit the technology of Rafale and F15T. Also, I'm wondering whether it is possible that budget problems led to the delayed annoucement in NGF selection. </strong><br><br>P.S. If this posts happens to be a repeat, I'm truly sorry and pls lead me to the original post as I haven't been chasing up about developments of our Naval helios.[/b]</blockquote>???? Contract already signed in Jan ??? What talking you ?<br><br>The Straits Times, - Saturday, January 22 2005<br>Also Mindef webpage.<br><br>MINDEF has <strong>signed a contract</strong> with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of the United States to acquire six new Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopters which will operate off the Republic of Singapore NavyÂ’s (RSN) new frigates.<br><br>The acquisition of naval helicopters, equipped with advanced anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare sensors and weapons, is a significant milestone in the RSNÂ’s force development. The naval helicopters are projected for delivery to the RSN between 2008 and 2010. This acquisition will enhance the RSNÂ’s capability to undertake a wide spectrum of missions and carry out its mission of defending Singapore and its vital sea lines of communications more effectively.<br></div>

That's why we can buy so many things with our budget. On the other hand, they should also consider consolidating the no. of overseas training grounds. this should help to save some money as well.<br><br>Even countries like UK and S Korea got to scale down their purchases becos of budget constraints.

Gotland is about 60mx6m (1500 tons) while Challenger is about 50mx6m (1100 tons). Not that different really.<br><br>I would say tactics and training play a very important part. You need to know your boat really well too. Know where your noise source is and know how to control your noise level to stay ultra quiet.</div>
