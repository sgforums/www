            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Blockhead:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, i went into NS in the early 90s and there was complaining back then. I am sure pple complained back in the 80s and 70s as well. i would put money down on seeing kids complain abt NS 20years from now. The fact of the matter is that people will always complain, especially when they are forced to do something, whether good or bad.<br><br>Anyway, a lot of pple complain abt NS because it is percieved to be the cool thing to do. See what happens if somebody said "Yes, i am looking forward to NS" and how his frens would react. On the other hand, most guys who come thru NS would agree (grudgingly) that it was interesting and that they had their fair bit to look back at with some fondness. Of course, there will be those bitter people who leave with a bad taste in their mouth.<br><br>Personally, i think i enjoyed my NS days, but only after i ROD'd and thought back about the times i had. However, its a bit difficult to enjoy it when u are going thru it.<br><br>For those who are going to go into NS, just remember, take it one day at a time. U go in thinking u are wasting your time, u will end up feeling that u are wasting your time. Just go in, and keep an open mind, and be positive. A positive attitude is everything, especially during NS, and even so during life. If its one thing NS taught me, it's the importance of a positive attitude. Sometimes, it will be the only thing that's keeping u going.<br><br>Sometimes, its also the luck of the draw, cos its also the officers or NCO's or pple in the unit who can make your NS interesting or just painful. I was from a log unit, so i didn't have to run around in the jungles, but i appreciate the fact that i had a good crew and good higher-ups (ok, most of them!) watching out for us.<br><br>I wouldn't sign-on as a regular, and i am not crazy about the army, but i appreciate what its taught me, and the experiences i had in there. besides, NS stories are also a great way to break the ice when u meet other singaporeans!<br><br>just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well said...echos more or less my thoughts exactly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>For those who are serving, or yet to enlist..............SAF is not just about military training, is also about human management and interaction. Each of us come from different background, lifestyle and culture.......One has to learn, adapt and co-exist with others. For those who's parents are protective, and "shield" them from the world, I guess is a rude shock.<br><br>There are bound to be black sheep, like back stabbers, apple polishers, sabo kings....but I assure you that it's not that much different in the working world....sometimes your office is worse! SAF is just 2.5 yrs....if you can't adapt...the rest of your working life how ??<br><br>Is all in the brain.....if you think SAF sucks...and rotten...you will find your life inside miserable. If you go in with a positive, "can-do" attitude, learn to adapt, and shrug the unhappiness aside....Life in SAF can be fun, and interesting.<br><br>Life is not a bed of roses, is all about learning to make the best out of any situation....the mentality that determines the outcome...<br><br>Also.....the friendship that you form inside, will last over the years. It's not uncommon to call each other up for some favor or assistance in office work/personal stuff after SAF. Try not make "enemies" inside SAF also....who knows...they may end up as your boss or supervisor.  Worse...you might even lose a business deal.<br><br>In short...go in with a open mind, positive attitude!<br><br>The above is my personal view, not aimed or directed at anyone. No offense of anykind meant.... Just in case......SAF lesson...cover backside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think tat NS is important n i really support NS. Its the system and the way they work tat make it a bit fuck up tats why most ppl feel tat NS is a burden or hassel.... One thing i cannot understand is why SAF allow teenager to take on the role of officer... Some of them r still not mature n act childishly, this really make my eye sore... My warrant officer once told me tat last time when he was young he also has the same feeling as me but now older liao he juz dun care abt them anymore... I also hear ppl saying tat SAF is a dumping ground for those ppl tat cannot survive in the commercial sector hence sign on as SAF will so call give them the security they need... Maybe this is the reason why sometime we feel its so fuck up as we r working under those scumbags of the society... I have posted to 4 different units before n i notice tat esp the management eg DY manager, AO etc r all really cannot make it if they wanna go outside n work.... Hmmm to be fair mayb i sway as i haven't get to work under those good one...</div>
