LKY has warned MY that unilateral cutting off our water means war!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>They have threaten but they never dare to do so.<br><br>Another example is the Pedra Branca issue, which after the Couragous incident, the Malaysian kept on intruded into the water of Pedra Branca and proclaimimg joint patrol. With  warning from Dr. Tan , the intrusion ceased.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>If RSN is as weak as Brunei's navy , I dun think it will stop.<br><br>Our stability which are greatly due to our military power mean a good location for FDI, otherwise how could we continue to enjoy economical growth for so long!!!<br><br>Therefore dun say that that NS is a total waste of time becos NS ensure our safety , stability and finally financially as well.<br><br>For ppl who dislike NS are those who dislike the discipline imposed on them which is universal in any uniform group . Without it, nothing will be achieved, otherwise how could you motivate a large group of unruly ppl to continue fight on for more than 48hrs!!!!<br><br>Therefore dun say NS is a waste of time, you dislike it becos you dun like to be shout at or told what to do all the time, you dun like the restrictive disciplined organisation like the SAF, period.<br><br>For those who think that way most probably will "keng" and mark by all his superior as well as peers, which mean a very miserable life during NS , but with a postive attitude toward NS, you might even enjoy it.<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"><br><br></div>
