Hmm....</div></blockquote>Doesn't matter if you are trained to the fullest, with that kind of attitude you probably won't make it through BMT. So much about who's boss.<br><br>If you don't like NS, do the following<br><br>1. Go for a sex change or;<br>2. Renounce your citizenship, and go elsewhere or;<br>3. Win the next election and abolish NS<br><br>For option 3, I doubt you are that capable because of your immaturity and skewered view and not to mention that you are underaged.<br><br>For option 2, it represent your best chance to skip NS. Very simple, you want Singapore citizenship, you jolly well serve. If not, go elsewhere, for people like us who have served and will be fighting for Singapore, I doubt we will want to waste time protecting you. We rather put a bullet into your head to save us the trouble.<br><br>Looking at option 1, it would seem that it is the most suitable for you. Since you have no balls to take on the NS challenge, you might as well cut it off. Not only do you not have to serve, you can still carve a career for yourself in the world's oldest profession.</div>

If you can have your freedom to post stupid reply, then perhaps I too have the freedom to counter your postings even though it might seem offensive to you.<br><br>Remember, your freedom to post such reply is because there are NSmen doing their duty.<br><br>Serving NS for 2.5 years is not the same as rape as the latter involves forcefully getting the victim to enage in a carnal relationship. If it is really against your will to serve, then please refer to my previous posting and select one of the options instead of staying here to rant about NS.<br><br>You think people are going to warn you when they shoot you?

The actual line goes, "Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country".<br><br>More importantly, to Ayukat's flaccid stance, is the closing of Patton's speech: "Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside with your grandson on your knee, and he asks you, What did you do in the great World War Two? You won't have to say, Well, I shoveled sh*t in Louisiana".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You guys want something with substance? Fine, I posted this before and I will do it again and of course I added some new points.<br><br>In my opinion, National Service should be made optional and for both men and women. National Service is a waste of time because it costs us 2 to 2.5 years of our entire lifetime and Singapore is too small its almost impossible to win a war and besides putting up a strong defence is useless as we are only wasting human resources and in the end what will be will be. Spending 2 to 2.5 years doing National Service rots our brain, we will probably forget everything we learn in school which means that we need to spend extra time reading up about stuff again and it hampers our chances to find a good job especially for those industries that improve all the time, it will be difficult to catch up. Although its true that National Service builds up confidence but only for a minority because more people are being scolded and shouted at during National Service than scolding and shouting at people. This will only make them lose their confidence and increases their stress which in turn leads to drinking and smoking, this could result in broken families as its easily addictive. National Service only provides us with a measly income every month where we could be earning tens of thousands contributing to the nation's economy during that 2 to 2.5 years. And also since National Service is being forced and not volunteered, who can ensure that during a war the soldiers will stay behind and fight for the country instead of running away? In the past, people claimed that women contribution to the country is by giving birth but nowadays the birthrate has decreased drastically does that mean they are still doing their " National Service " properly? Isn't it time they contribute 2 to 2.5 years of their entire life to the nation too? Even more importantly, it isn't right to force someone against their will to do things. No doubt, freedom comes with a price but why is only the men paying the price and not the women? The women get government subsidies too, school fees, transport fares .etc And how come people with higher degree of education have to serve for a longer period of time? No doubt, those people are more useful but their intelligence can be used else where like in improving the country's economic. If an average person lives up to for example 75 years old, ( 75/100 ) * 2.5 = 1.875 %. Its devoting 1.875 % percent of our life to the country. A country that we did not choose to be born in as we do not have a choice.<br><br>I know most of you would tell me to emigrate and I would gladly do that too if I had the money. Sure, you can have force conscription all you like, I won't complain but please make it fair to the people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I am kid and I have no right to complain but if I don't complain now, what is the point of complaining after I complete NS?
