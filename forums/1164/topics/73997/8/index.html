            <div class='col-md body'>Someone waaayy back asked about General Patton's quote, here you go :<br><blockquote>Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.</blockquote>General Patton's most famous speech in full is here :<br><a href="http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/patton_20010914.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geoffmetcalf.com/patton_20010914.html</a><br>One of my favourite speeches. I'm not pro-america, but that has to be the most colourful speech I've ever seen/heard.<br><br>Another quote from him (to all the chao keng pple around) :<br><blockquote>You may be thankful that twenty years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what you did in the great World War II, you WON'T have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, <strong>'Well, your Granddaddy shoveled sh!t in Louisiana.'</strong> </blockquote>Another one, to illustrate the shouting phenomena in the SAF,<br><blockquote>When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to some bunch of little old ladies at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity; and it has to be eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight it's way out of a piss-soaked paper bag</blockquote>You've never been in ANY army if you've never taken a scolding with profanities in it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll say something different for once.<br><br>When I was still in Secondary School, my CCA was Dance. Everytime when there was a performance we had to do rehearsals. There was once we even had to come back to school on Sunday mornings and stay till 8 PM+ in the night. Everytime our teacher would get angry because we weren't up to his standard and started scolding us, throwing the microphone, throwing the tables, chairs and even the radio. The throwing part is unbelievable right? But I swear its competely true.<br><br>There was a time, due to some disagreement with one of the other teachers he threw the chair and table with the radio on top infront of her. I remembered the other teacher ended up crying. The teachers even scolded us with a Chinese saying, erm whats that about lousy wood can't be carved? Especially during competitions he tend to get more hotheaded. The scoldings can go on for hours, the longest was about 4 hours, one of my friends fell asleep there was even a " cok! " sound made when his head fell on the floor. Lolz.<br><br>Everytime, after the scoldings, our leaders or ex-seniors would gather us for another talk of our own. We sat down to think of what went wrongly, how to amend the problem and sometimes we would do some physical punishments.<br><br>Everytime after a performance, the satisfiction is undescribable even though I seldom show it. The shared joy and all the hardwork. Everytime after our performance our teacher would always praised us no matter how good or lousy we were. He would tell us not to think about it and sleep well as we had a long day.<br><br>Whenever we win a competition, erm....we haven't lost before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I meant we always got the Gold Award. The happiness and joy is even greater. However, I feel that its not because of the award, its become of our teamwork, unity and care for each other that makes me feel proud and happy.<br><br>I just wanted to ask, is that the feeling you all are talking about?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, i can't believe this has carried on for so long!<br><br>Look, it is clear u do not like NS. That's fine, really. But the fact remains that u still have to do it, unless u have a 'get out of singapore free' card, and can 'escape' to some other country and don't come back.<br><br>The fact of the matter is, what u get out of it depends on what u put into it. If u expect to totally detest it and consider it a waste of time, your next few years will be hell, and frankly speaking, u will perform badly thru out your service, and u will feel like crap for the whole period.<br><br>You will not get any sympathy from your compatriots, and especially from the pple here who have had to go thru it with your belly-aching.

I don't go around assuming that people are out to boost their egos simply because they disgree with me, and i suggest that u do the same. If u think my post was out to "insult" or to "undermine his integrity", it would be useful for u to point out why u think so.<br><br>I post what i think, and i think i was giving a piece of advice. u can take it, or leave it, it does not really matter to me.<br><br>I respect the fact that u have a view. But the fact of the matter remains that a lot of this "motivation" comes from within. U want to affect change in the SAF? good for u. Go sign on as a regular, and affect change from within.<br></div>
