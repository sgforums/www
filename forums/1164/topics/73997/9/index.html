If good is white and evil is black, then the world is in shades of gray. It's cliched, but true.<br><br><strong>I just wanted to ask, is that the feeling you all are talking about?</strong><br>Yes and no. In NS the tekan is a lot worse than <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> the civilian world trainers (other than national athletes trainers) can dish out. Sometimes for no reason at all you all get it. From what I see all your bonding inside your CCA is because you belonged to the best. All that motivation to carry on with unreasonable training came from the pride that you wanted to remain the best.<br><br>In NS, you might belong to the worst unit, and still have that spirit. Because you have suffered along with them though thick and thin whether you were willing or not.<br><br><strong>I didn't chose that CCA, it was the best solution for getting high CCA points in the shortest time.

Training is has little meaning compared to those.</strong><br>There is meaning in training, to defend the country. Just that most people like you, choose to ignore it or think it meaningless.<br><br><strong>Ya its fun.. BUT After NS Is there a gurantee.? U will Find a job... All Those F****ing Companies Wan F***ing Experiences..</strong><br>What kind of reasoning is that? If everyone goes through NS, isn't it even? If you were able to get a job before NS, how does NS change anything? Besides employers look at qualifications, either you have it or you don't. And some jobs actually require you to have completed NS.<br><br><strong>I dislike mingling with friends and making friends but the power of unity, teamwork and care is undescribable and the feeling is great.

            <div class='col-md body'>i've been following this for a while..this is kinda interesting, but i'll just give my 2 cents worth.. well you can say NS sucks and all that, but heck, its needed.. lest other countries take advantage of our small size and vulnerability, no matter how peaceful we try to be.. ayukat, its clear that you do not like NS, and thats not uncommon with today's children. hell i'm around the same age as you (i'm 15 this year..), haven't served yet, and there are a lot of people in my class, my school, and other schools that say "i'm going to migrate before i serve NS".. i'm sick of that line..think they're so macho by saying that they are going to pontang NS.. well i hate to say this but our generation (gen-brat according to meander) is really too pampered..<br><br>Well, if the time ever(touch wood) comes when we have to fight to protect what is ours, are you going to walk out on Singapore? given your current mentality, i'm sure you say you would. But when you grow up (if you're still here that is  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ), own property and assets here, have a gf (assuming you ever get one), get married etc, when our safety, peace, sovereignty, (and maybe your gf's virginity) is threatened, will you still walk out on us? We'll never know until the time really comes won't we..<br><br>You say you'd fight for your own freedom but not the country's freedom? let me ask you, how'd you fight then? with a pair of scissors? ah ma's chopping knife? well to quote wuming's nick, "That's what an army is -- a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers" You stand a much better chance of fighting back and kicking whoever's ass that's trying to get us..yeah..hope you'll think abt it.<br><br>anyway..its not who you're fighting against; its who you're fighting alongside with<br><br>oh and flashgalaxy, i shan't comment much on you..you're just being a sh*thole here. wonder whether you're just someone elses double nick.</div>

Nobody sets the line. If good is white and evil is black, then the world is in shades of gray. It's cliched, but true.<br><br><strong>I just wanted to ask, is that the feeling you all are talking about?</strong><br>Yes and no. In NS the tekan is a lot worse than <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> the civilian world trainers (other than national athletes trainers) can dish out. Sometimes for no reason at all you all get it. From what I see all your bonding inside your CCA is because you belonged to the best. All that motivation to carry on with unreasonable training came from the pride that you wanted to remain the best.<br><br>In NS, you might belong to the worst unit, and still have that spirit. Because you have suffered along with them though thick and thin whether you were willing or not.<br><br><strong>I didn't chose that CCA, it was the best solution for getting high CCA points in the shortest time. I didn't had a CCA then and my previous CCA teacher brought me to the Dance teacher because it was the most tedious CCA. She wanted to suffer in misery but she lost. I was happier in there.</strong><br>Think of it this way, you might not be willing to go to NS as well, but you might very well end up happy too.<br><br><strong>I am pretty sure that National Service is very meaningful not because of the training but because of the friends you made in there, the friendship, unity, teamwork and care. Training is has little meaning compared to those.</strong><br>There is meaning in training, to defend the country. Just that most people like you, choose to ignore it or think it meaningless.<br><br><strong>Ya its fun.. BUT After NS Is there a gurantee.? U will Find a job... All Those F****ing Companies Wan F***ing Experiences..</strong><br>What kind of reasoning is that? If everyone goes through NS, isn't it even? If you were able to get a job before NS, how does NS change anything? Besides employers look at qualifications, either you have it or you don't. And some jobs actually require you to have completed NS.<br><br><strong>I dislike mingling with friends and making friends but the power of unity, teamwork and care is undescribable and the feeling is great. I don't want to experience that feeling again because it is highly hard to come by, highly addictive and you can't have it alone you'll need friends but I know I will have to during NS.</strong><br>I shall ignore that because obviously you are in some sort of confused teenage transition stage.[/b]</blockquote>No, I absolutely dislike company. I have to tolerate their habits, thinking .etc Yes, I am confused, not about this but about why? Why is there Good and Evil? Right and Wrong? Black and White? Who sets the line between them? The first person who sets the line, what criterias did he used?<br><br>Why can't we have peace? Wars are commonly fought to gain power and freedom. If they want power give it to them. If they want freedom give it to them. Why is the world divided into different countries, languages, races and religions? Doesn't that cause people to feel divided and causes clashes to happen more easily and more often. Why do we need people to lead us? Aren't all humans equal?<br><br>Money? Why do we use money? Why can't we just give and take? Its easier and makes life a lot simpler. If this happens nobody would want to work hard but don't you think that people wouldn't want to improve? Don't you think the people wouldn't have thought about that?<br><br>Men and Women, yes they are 2 separate entity of the same species but do we truely have to be so conservative? Who is the first person that sets the line between the 2? Why do we have to differentiate between certain untouchable parts? What would happen if you touched them? Would they die? No.<br><br>Okay, this is off Topic. Someday, I'll bring this up again when I am ready.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey I got an idea... since you are so good at challanging social norms for the sake of it, why don't you go out there for some pratical, hands on session and see what happens instead of posting a long, but ultimately useless post here.<br><br>I wonder how well your outrage of modesty defence would be, considering it is based on the fact that "The woman did not die wat/"<br><br>All the best.<br><br>Anyway, there are several very obvious reasons, why private parts are, well private, and that has a lot to do with natural selection behavioural biology as well, if we didn't have these norms in place, we humans may not be here today to hear you undo several thousand years of progressive thinking with your lack of thoughtful repose.<br><br>Come to think of it, I'm not exactly sure that's a bad thing, hmm... but nah, it's just you, no point slowing down progress just for you.</div>

We need to socialise to be mentally healthy. Different ppl different style. Many habits, many thoughts but all we need is tame our own mind n all becomes clear. U have the energy but it's running around like a crazy elephant trampling all the houses in the village. Tame this beast n everyone u see is suddenly not so difficult to tolerate.<br><br>Why. Questions we all ask but few seek the answers. For one at ur age to be thinking so much. Questions r there for us to learn.  We have problems becos of ego, pride, anger and so on. All this can be prevented by taming our wild elephant. N when it is tamed, we can see things much clearer.<br><br>We fight, argue, cheat, covet etc becos of ignorance. Unknowingly creating great harm to others. We think money means happiness but it is not true happiness. Only when we have contentment n remove much of our wrong views then can we even begin to experince happiness. But it's such a tough road dat few really attempt.<br><br>We do not touch others becos we know dat it is wrong. We ourselves know dat our mind is not pure when we purposely touch for eg a lady on her breast. They won't die but it insults them when it's uninvited. Since we agree dat men n women r 2 separate entities, there will be different rules then. We cannot punish a child the way we punish an adult right. There will be differences.<br><br>So much frustration with no outlet. An interesting mind with so much energy but untamed.</div>
