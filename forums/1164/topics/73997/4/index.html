Without it, nothing will be achieved, otherwise how could you motivate a large group of unruly ppl to continue fight on for more than 48hrs!!!!<br><br>Therefore dun say NS is a waste of time, you dislike it becos you dun like to be shout at or told what to do all the time, you dun like the restrictive disciplined organisation like the SAF, period.<br><br>For those who think that way most probably will "keng" and mark by all his superior as well as peers, which mean a very miserable life during NS , but with a postive attitude toward NS, you might even enjoy it.<br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"><br><br></div></blockquote>X5<br><br>for those who think singapore would never be in a war or will never win a war? think again, yes, singapore might be at less-odds when fighting a war........but for me, i rather die a soldier(or a fighting man) then live as a %^&amp;&amp;^ person under occupation.....</div>
