Fine, I posted this before and I will do it again and of course I added some new points.<br><br>In my opinion, National Service should be made optional and for both men and women. National Service is a waste of time because it costs us 2 to 2.5 years of our entire lifetime and Singapore is too small its almost impossible to win a war and besides putting up a strong defence is useless as we are only wasting human resources and in the end what will be will be. Spending 2 to 2.5 years doing National Service rots our brain, we will probably forget everything we learn in school which means that we need to spend extra time reading up about stuff again and it hampers our chances to find a good job especially for those industries that improve all the time, it will be difficult to catch up. Although its true that National Service builds up confidence but only for a minority because more people are being scolded and shouted at during National Service than scolding and shouting at people. This will only make them lose their confidence and increases their stress which in turn leads to drinking and smoking, this could result in broken families as its easily addictive. National Service only provides us with a measly income every month where we could be earning tens of thousands contributing to the nation's economy during that 2 to 2.5 years. And also since National Service is being forced and not volunteered, who can ensure that during a war the soldiers will stay behind and fight for the country instead of running away? In the past, people claimed that women contribution to the country is by giving birth but nowadays the birthrate has decreased drastically does that mean they are still doing their " National Service " properly? Isn't it time they contribute 2 to 2.5 years of their entire life to the nation too? Even more importantly, it isn't right to force someone against their will to do things. No doubt, freedom comes with a price but why is only the men paying the price and not the women? The women get government subsidies too, school fees, transport fares .etc And how come people with higher degree of education have to serve for a longer period of time? No doubt, those people are more useful but their intelligence can be used else where like in improving the country's economic. If an average person lives up to for example 75 years old, ( 75/100 ) * 2.5 = 1.875 %. Its devoting 1.875 % percent of our life to the country. A country that we did not choose to be born in as we do not have a choice.<br><br>I know most of you would tell me to emigrate and I would gladly do that too if I had the money. Sure, you can have force conscription all you like, I won't complain but please make it fair to the people.<br><br></div></blockquote>friend, you call this substance, sigh, one thing, you said the womans are not doing their duty, true, those who never add to the population are not doing their duty, but let me tell you this, i rather be shoot at then to bloody experience labour pain man.<br><br>and you keep saying singapore will never win in any war and that a strong defence is useless. look at brunei! with their money they can become a power in ASIAN, but they are alwast push around, why? because of their weak defence!(althou i heard their weapon and equipment is US class). If singapore have a weak defence force, We would be push around by Malaysia and indonesia, we would be force to accept unreasonable water price, we would be force to PAY TRIBUTES! and if we really are in war, i hope you will have a nice time being push around by our invaders if we loss, or being call a COWARD, a loser or such by fellow mans who fought for their land, fought for their family, fought for themselve. in war, you loss when you first thought is, "OMG, we are gonna loss this!!!!"<br><br>and seriously, when you really ask, how many people fell they are forced to serve AFTER THEY finish serving, i think i can tell you i trust that at least 80percent of our fighting man will gladly say they are glad they serve.<br><br>PS: i haven serve yet, i don look forward to serving(due to my darned fitness, someone give advice on how to get gold from a NAPHA fail in 2 years). i hope by the end of the 2 years, i will be looking forward to paying my dues to my land.</div>

You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country".<br><br>More importantly, to Ayukat's flaccid stance, is the closing of Patton's speech: "Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside with your grandson on your knee, and he asks you, What did you do in the great World War Two? You won't have to say, Well, I shoveled sh*t in Louisiana".</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  eh... u got the 2nd part right.. but i'm not sure if u got the first part...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</span> = it is sweet and honourable to die for one's country...<br><br>the poem of the same name was written by wilfred owen... that poem describes the bloody horrors of the trenches in WW 1... he was neither pro-war nor pro-military...<br><br>incidentally, i agree with some parts of his thoughts... "that old lie, dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" is one of them...<br><br>we do not fight for glory or grand rhetoric... once out in the field, u fight for survival and for the sake of your comrades beside u... if u're a rifleman, u wanna have a beer with your budddies afterwards. if u're a commander, its your responsibility to bring all your guys (as well as yourself) BACK.<br><br>there is no honour in death. but there is honour in fighting for things that u hold dear. NS helps us do that.<br><br>oh Ayukat, regarding the point that u get yelled at a lot in NS... u should check out some workplaces... both gov't AND private...<br><br>u go tell your stressed out boss that he shouldn't yell at u for not meeting your sales target... u go tell him that u pissed off his million dollar client... or go tell him that u shredded the only copy of an irreplaceable document... he can't make u run circles round a field or make u knock it down, but i guarantee u, its still friggin' unpleasant... u'ld rather he just makes u knock it down.<br><br>more pple become alcoholics from the above than from NS... in fact, some actually find it a welcomed reprieve (not quite holiday) from work...<br></div>

Possible explainations<br><br>1) There are people who are afraid of hardships but using 'wasting time' as an excuse to cover their tracks<br><br>2) Not wanting to leave your comfort zone e.g. your parents, girlfriendsand comfy bed<br><br>3) It is really a waste of time<br><br>4) Against the individual religious beliefs<br><br>5) PRs not wanting to contribute to the country who wants to stay but do not want to contribute<br><br>6) Lack of love for country<br><br>maybe someone here who major in psychology can do a paper on these of people and get mindef for funding!!!!<br><br>i have done my NS.... yes sometimes it sucks.... but overall i had some/many good experiences..... it made me a better person..... the character building during NS itself is valuable..... my advice is there both positive and negative things in whatever you do.... if you just focus on one side of the coin.... most often than not, you will be and remain unhappy.<br>I<br></div>
