            <div class='col-md body'>The most successful mission of my battalion that I can think of occured during a deployment at an area that was under development (preparation for construction) years and years ago.<br><br>If anyone has experienced an gun artillery battlion deployment, he would have have known the amount of havoc that we create in the training area.   Imagine 12 fully laden 7ton MAN truck (weighs over 18t fully loaded) each towing a 9t gun travelling at high speed in the muddy ground (twice the weight of an AMX13 tank).   During the deployment itself, two holes had to be dug for each gun - 24 holes for the battalion.<br><br>Anyway, the surveyor or contractor of the piece of land watched with horror as all this was going on.   He got out a camera and started taking photographs.   Our CO got wind of what this person was doing and was ordered the S3 to do something about it.<br><br>The S3 chased the surveyor with a LandRover, stopped him and confisticated his camera.   Mission accomplished :-)</div>
