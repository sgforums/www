The actual death toll is in excess of 10,000.</strong> (See the official records at the end of this piece.) Given the officially acknowledged number of over 15,000 seriously wounded (and a published total of 25,000 wounded overall,), this elevated death toll is far more realistic than the current 2,000+ now being officially published. When our research is complete, and watertight, we will publish the results along with the sources In addition to the evident falsification of the death rolls, at least 5,500 American military personnel have deserted, most in Ireland but more have escaped to Canada and other European countries, none of whom are inclined to cooperate with vengeful American authorities. (See TBR News of 18 February for full coverage on the mass desertions) This means that of the 158,000 U.S. military shipped to Iraq, 26,000 deserted, were killed or seriously wounded. <strong>The DoD lists currently being very quietly circulated indicate over12,000 dead, over 25,000 seriously wounded and a large number of suicides, forced hospitalization for ongoing drug usage and sales, murder of Iraqi civilians and fellow soldiers, rapes, courts martial and so on </strong>-<br><br>Viewers of TBR News who would like a copy of the original DoD Supplementary Casualty lists, showing the actual military deaths from March 2003 through July, 2005 as taken from their official site (now deleted) and showing over 10,000 actual deaths, can obtain these facsimiles directly from Mr. Harring by sending him an email message at: brianharring@yahoo.com  ( As of October 10, 2006, Mr. Harring has sent out over 17,481 lists.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious...why do they space the ammo dump so closely together instead of spacing them further apart?Such that in the event of a motar/arty/rocket/missile strike, the damage will be limited?</div>
