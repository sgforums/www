            <div class='col-md body'>There have been talk of constructing a canal similar to that of the Suez and Panama canal in the Ismuthus of Kra in Southern Thailand since the idea is being brought up in the 1800s.

However, its construction have not been been carried out due to several reasons.<br><br>Recently there is a report saying that China is secretly planning to finance its construction and have Chinese ports and naval bases in that region.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Several reason why the canal will not be a threat.<br><br>1. Ships are different from what they are 100 years ago when raffles came. They can travel for miles without stopping. Why bother to have a port of call that does not have the infrastructure and need to be established when there is one easily available.<br><br>2. But having the canal, Thailand will be seriously compromsing their control in the south especially with a muslim south and a buddist north. Remeber the 2003-4 uprising in the south of thailand b4 the tsunami thingy started? Doubt the thais wanna to do something like that. Even with China's backing.<br><br>3. Singapore is no more the same Singapore when we were independent where we are the mainly entrepot state like Hong Kong. Our government has concentrated on other stuffs such as manufacturing and finanical services. All these are not depend on the shipping lines. At the same time, airplanes with more important airports are more important to trade.<br><br>4. Agreed Mynamar government is a little crazy, then if u study burmese history all their kings abdicate as a result of going crazy near the end of their rule. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Maybe they have their reason for changing their capital??

            <div class='col-md body'>Should such a canal be constructed it will present a serious challenge to our port as a large part of shipping which will bypass us.

            <div class='col-md body'>Building of Kras Canal is technical feasible but politically a definite "no-go".<br><br>The first question for any builder of Kras Canal will face:<br>Which nation will control the access and gurantee the security of the Kras Canal?<br><br>If Kras Canal is to be build, the water way will be very similar to the Suez Canal. The narrow waterway is very prone to security problems eg terror attacks on high value targets in the waterway.<br><br>The US, Jap and China, European or even the Aust and Indian would want a piece of pie from the Kras Canal....this will put Thailand in a very delicate balance points btw all these world and regional powerhouses.<br><br>No matter which powers is behind the Kras Canal, there will only be troubles in the Thai soils esp the insurgents will step up their activities in the south to pressurise Thailand gov to grant them independence in the south. This will create immediate plotical unrest in northen Malaysia states and southern Thailand. I am confident to say that this Kras Canal will unbalance the struggle btw the secular muslim and the die-hard fundermentalists.<br><br>The die-hard fundermentalists will find a new power base to spread their ideology throughout the SE Asia. More importantly, the building of Kras canal will have the follwoing negative impacts on Thailand Gov:<br><br>1) The drain of valuable resources that can be used to combat the poverty in the south. This funds can swing the tides in combating the insurgents separists movement in the southern Thailand.<br><br>2) Kras Canal will certainly attracts foreign investors and gov to the south Thailand. This move is certainly unwise, as the presence of foreigners might create social pressure points in the south Thailand.<br><br>3) Thailand gov will be put on the international lime lights once Kras Canals graps the main headline in major international press. This will certainly limit the Thailand gov effort in combating terrorism in the south.<br><br>4) Local muslim political leaders will have more excuses to ask for more freedom from the Thailand gov. This is certainly untolerable for many Thais.<br><br>5) Worsen relationship btw Malaysia and Thainland due to economical advantages from the Kras Canal. Thailand gov worries over growing influences of local muslim population and their cosy relationship with Malaysia as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just get PSA and Temasek holdings to buy all the ports along the Kra Canal. so even if they stop at kra canal, they will still have to pay for singapore services. the only bad thing is that we have to employ their people to work in our port.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Kra Canal, as it's commonly referred to in the Maritime industry, was suppose to be built a long time ago. Word on the street is that the Burmese govt was "paid off" so that they would hold back construction. Recently, they have been looking into the idea of using it as a landbridge insead of having to dig up a canal..</div>
