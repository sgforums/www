My point is your views on how to break up riot police formation is actually giving pontential trouble makers ideas. You are also encouraging others to throw in ideas on how to break the riot police formation.<br><br>Do you actually wish to see a all out riot and suntec city area becoming a battle zone? It wouldn't do Singapore any good if we do see our riot police falling and suntec city becoming a battle zone.<br><br>I know you are interested in military/law enforcement stuff and maybe you would kindly think twice before putting it down in the forum.<br><br>Oh btw, your SPF Ammo SOP topic is still an unsolved issue in HQ NCC.<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=194985" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=194985</a><br>So please excerise caution in future posting.<br></div></blockquote>Obviously,you've missed the entire idea of this issue. Which is to discuss the virtues and limitations of the various military formations. And like I've earlier posted, if the moderator/s feel that this thread is giving people ideas, I've advised that it be closed. My track record here has been to raised issues, you may ask forumnites such as Gedaken, Fudgester, that many issues such as possible actions that the SAF/SPF might take in the event of terrorist attacks in unprotected civilian installations have been mentioned once before. My sole intention of joining this forum and putting postings is to seek opinion and views.Honestly, this thread is up just to study the various formations that have been used since Napoleonic Times, it is not to incite ideas for creativity to troublemakers or potential troublemakers.<br><br>Infact, there are a bazillion websites/books available which discusses the virtues of various formations and the use of weaponry/types of troops effectively. So if you are telling me to exercise restraint/responsibility in my posts, it is noted. But however if you are asking me not to seek the opinions of others in the forum on their views, wouldn't that have defeated the purpose of having forums in the first place?<br><br>And regarding the SPF Ammo SOP,irregardless of whether HQ NCC / HQ NPCC  has resolved it, it was honest to god oversight, we all do make mistakes at some point in time and I sincerely apologized if it has stirred the pot or rock the boat violently.<br><br>Once again to moderators, please close this thread if it is deemed to be suggestive, violence inciting, potentially trouble-making, stoking the fire, stirring the pot or whatsoever. I thank you sincerely for it.Many thanks to the folk who have contributed to my thread and sorry if I've caused trouble to any of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>easy06,<br><br>If you have realised, my emphasis right from the start is on tactics. Not on the use of force. And yes, you have it spot on that I'm interested in Military/Law Enforcement, however I do not seek violence as manner to resolve issues. In my opinion, the best / most successful op. is one that is accomplised without bloodshed or a single lost of live. The success of a mission is not the high bodycount, but the dear that you strike deep into the hearts of the enemy and make them think twice about fighting you and the potential for them to losing it all.<br><br>SpecOps87<br></div>

Any public gathering of<br>more than four people requires a police permit and a person<br>convicted of unlawful assembly can be fined up to S$1,000 ($650).<br><br>Caning is commonly used as punishment for offences ranging from<br>vandalism to drugs. Offenders are strapped to an A-shaped wooden<br>frame and lashed across the bare buttocks by a professional caner<br>with a rattan rod.<br><br>In 1994, Singapore made international headlines when it caned<br>American teenager Michael Fay for spray-painting cars.<br><br>Singapore, which expects over 16,000 delegates and officials to<br>descend on the city-state for the Sept. 11-20 World Bank/IMF<br>meeting, has said outdoor protests are banned because they could<br>be exploited by terrorist groups to stage attacks.<br><br>The city-state has only conceded that it would allow indoor<br>protests within a designated area in the lobby of the conference<br>venue. The lobby area is smaller than a football field.<br><br>According to guidelines issued by the police, activist groups<br>must not move out of the designated areas, and are not allowed to<br>use sound amplification systems or burn items or behave in a<br>manner that would "provoke a breach of peace". Protesters must<br>also be properly attired at all times.<br><br>The World Bank has said outdoor protests should be allowed<br>during the conference, but Singapore police said they would not<br>waive the current rules.<br><br>"The Bank's preference for these meetings and all others has<br>been to seek space for civil society to protest peacefully<br>outside. That remains our preferred position," Peter Stephens,<br>spokesman for World Bank Singapore, said in a statement.<br><br>Some groups said they plan to organise indoor seminars.<br><br>"We still need to maximise our space and make ourselves heard,<br>so we will be organising seminars at hotels around the conference<br>centre to discuss issues such as agrarian reforms," said Indra<br>Lubis, a project assistant at La Via Campesina (The Peasant Way),<br>an international group which represents over 80 million farmers<br>worldwide.<br><br>"But frankly, it is not a very effective way to voice our<br>concerns. How are the delegates going to hear us when we are put<br>in separate rooms?"<br><br>- ENDS -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only way to stop the riot police is simple.. You can learn from the Germans barbarians... use calvary and Chariots with spikes at the wheet. Or how about some catapults and maybe some gasbomb... Hmmm anyway they bunch of barbarians in the ancient world are an army of mercenary not disorganised crowds... If Singapore have these bunch of paranoid people who are organised mercenary... I think most of us will be recalled back.. It wouldn't be the police to deal with it... but the guards with Sar21</div>
