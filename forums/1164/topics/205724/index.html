            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br><br>Been watching some video clips and news on TV and seen some riots. Yah, I know its a civil matter, not a military matter, but I' just wondering...are there ways to fight against a wall of riot police?<br><br>Been reading some military strategy books, and I've come to this conclusion.First we observe how the riot police operate, they stand in rows backed by their anti-riot vehicles etc. Equipment possessed is protective gear, a shield, helmet and for selected officers the tear gas grenade launcher. I believe firearms would not be use in this environment as it has a high tendency to be snatched away.<br><br>Now an analysis of the rioters, people armed with a variety of weapons such as metal/wooden rods, molotov cocktails, largely close contact weapons with few projectile weapons. The majority do not possess any form of protection, other then handerkerchiefs/scarves used to mask up preventing tear gas inhalation.<br><br>Now, the riot police actually stand in a wall, close packed to produce a menacing and intimidating view which will scare the rioters into surrendering. However, on being given the command to charge, tear gas canisters are launched, and the "wall" starts advancing slowly before breaking into a run. At this point, rarely does the rioters not flee. As the "wall" charges, follow-up vehicles with the spray come up and start to spray strong jets of water to further break the resistance of the rioters or dyes which makes them easily identifiable for arrest.<br><br>However, I was wondering, as often the police "wall" usually is a long line, 3-4 deep. Imagine if the rioters did not form themselves  into the "wall" to face a head-on with them, is it still possible for the police's "wall" to be effective? Instead the rioters should break into smaller groups of like 10-30 and gather into small groups (something like the infantry square) as the police "wall" charges the small groups should maintain cohesion, and the ending effect could be similar to that of running water around a rock.With the small groups of rioters as the rock, and the police "wall" as the water. Their effectiveness is built be the police's willingness to gain ground and the rioters turning their backs and fleeing. With their backs turned, this creates a "bloodlust" for the advancing group who will rush forward with more vigour and aggressivness to try break the rioters. If the small groups were to hold, the riot police will actually have the tendency to either rush forward or end up not knowing what to do, and may even try to dislodge these small groups. If they were to rush forward, then the rioters could turn on their backs. However, if they break-up to try dislodge these small groups, they end up breaking the almight and fearsome line. And thus, provide the rioters with a chance to fight back.<br><br>Thus,that's just the tactic I would use. But then again...thats just my opinion.Cheers!<br><br>(MOD if this is a sensitive topic,please close.Thanks)</div>

To be effective, the groups must be able to act independently and yet in co-ordinated fashion.<br><br>Before this can happen, the location for forming up the riot must be pre-meditated upon to facilitate the best advantage for the rioters during the actual face-off.  Maximum coverage of the intended 'kill-zone' for the riot squad must be afforded to the rioters, to allow the riot squad and their vehicles to be engaged from all angles.<br><br>Existing items of the immediate environment and infrastructure are to be availed immediately as ancilliary weapons, e.g. torn down street lighting poles can be hidden and used at the appropriate time when the riot squad has dispersed and their vehicles least protected, then huge co-ordinated attacks performed on the vehicles to overwhelm them - the lighting poles can be thrust through vehicle windows as battering rams, or the vehicles can simply be swamped and overturned by flanking parties to avoid any foam or water sprays.  If help is called out by the vehicle crews for the riot squad to return, remaining rioters will emerge from all surrounding buildings to molotov the riot squad or simply assault them from behind and seize their weapons as best they can - use sharp ends of their shields to drive through the armour joints in the riot squad to dismember them.  Or rip off their helmets to bash their heads in.</div>
