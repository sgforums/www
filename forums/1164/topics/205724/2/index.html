            <div class='col-md body'>Thing is, the objective is not to kill. If the objective is to kill, then there's no point already. The rioters can all form up behind a couple of bulldozers and use it the way AI form up beind their vehicles while advancing. The bulldozer can be used to clear the path amongst the rioters, or maybe have a couple of fuel tankers rush against them. But that would totally defeat the purpose...<br><br>What I'm trying to theorize here is that the effectiveness of one formation againt the other. So yeah, pipe bombs, will be overly lethal. I suppose that the rioters should actually not only cluster themselves into small groups they should also create obstacles which will also break up the effect of the effectiveness of the charge.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Responding with force against riot police is a silly thing to do, the riot police are outnumbered by the crowds, and are extremely nervous of getting overrun... once this threatens to happen, I think they will start using deadily force.

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest something, there is one main point that we al forget, Police are after all - Police! They never learned tactical movement. So this is already our advantage. We can draw them to places taht are in between buildings. From there, the real war begin. As the riots start to retreat but move in formation, the Riot police will advance. Don't forget, there is the normal Riot Police and there is also the Gurkha Riot Police. So as the retreat, people at the back can use cars as a very effective weapon. As the Police are in the middle of the two buildings, riots can use the buildings as a vantage point and throw molotove c.o.c.ktail at the police from above. Besides that, flower pots, furniture, TV and even bamboo poles at the police at the botom, of couse, you need to fortify the building entrances with blocked entrances.<br><br>This will throw the entire formation of police in a sate of disarray. As they are busy blocking the highrose projectiles. the cars from within the riot can drive out and crash straight through the ranks of teh police. As the cars drive up, the riots will charge up with the cars and attack the police, at this stage, all-hell-break-lose! the riotes must be armed with parangs and sorts which can be easily bought around Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with fighting against riot police (aside from the fact that they have the equipment to do some serious damage if they want to - molotov cocktail vs M203 + Helicopter gunships) is that the rioters need leaders to fight effectively as they are not trained to riot. The riot police exploit this by having snatch squads. Basically, they identify the leaders and then they wait for an opportunity to rush and capture the leaders. very effective tactic.<br><br></div>

Troops from outside Beijing were sent in to 'handle' the riot as the govt was worried that Beijing troops would sympathise with the rioters.<br><br>Anyway, the tainanmen was because the govt chose violent. For us, the reason why we deploy riot police is because we want to maintain peace. Remember that riot police's objective is to disperse the rioters.( and arrest masterminds) Not kill them.<br><br>So if the rioters are to attack the riot police who are there to keep peace, i wonder what the rioters want other than to create turmoil.</div>

If they drive a car and ram into the police, or use a car bomb, they are committing political suicide. They are turning the whole nation against them, that's like giving the govt the go-ahead to call in the military.

The riot police exploit this by having snatch squads. Basically, they identify the leaders and then they wait for an opportunity to rush and capture the leaders. very effective tactic.<br><br></div></blockquote>erm i don't think helicopter gunships and M203s are part of the riot police standard issue.</div>

If the state wanted to, they could employ helicopter gunships, m203s and more besides.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the biggest question is if the Gurkhas are deployed by the state, that would be considered the deployment of foreign mercenaries in local soil.<br><br>Doesn't anyone realise this? employment contract or not, they are still foreigners.

South Korean protestors have ample experience back in SK and more recently in HK. The usually drunk English hooligans will make things very difficult too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
