            <div class='col-md body'>The premise of the qn is flawed and really makes no sense.<br>I understand you are looking at it from a "weakness of the formation" tuype of viewpoint but still there are qns.<br><br>What is the aim of the rioters here?<br><br>If the aim is to stand ground, then breaking up into smaller groups is coutner productive since the riot polie will overrun you. The afore-mentioned snatch squads will also have a field day.<br><br>If you are looking at tactics against riot police in general I have another suggestion. Get paintballs filled with permanent dyes. Then mark the more agressive riot policeman. If you mark him, you send All of them a message: You cannot stay within the confines of the police station forever.<br><br>Might cause them to hesistate.</div>
