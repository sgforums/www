You can however get posted to these units upon passing out from SISPEC or OCS. Ranger course is open to everyone, so I heard, as long as they pass the selection and their unit allows them to go for it.</div>

Its the standard package, you need to complete and pass the following, IPPT, SOC and IFC.

Its to evaluate the soldier's leadership competency but most Instructors have a very dim view of how the Test properly stimulate a soldier's inherent ability to lead.<br><br>Most of the extra classroom instructions will be along the lines of indoctrination, videos and discussions to elicit soldier's responses, check their mentality.<br><br>I'm not current, so I hope there are some other forumers who can come forward and tell us more.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Don't quote me on it, though ~lol~<br><br>SISPEC training is still split beween BSLC &amp; ASLC, right? If that's the case, I don't see how it could hinder the continuation training for, say, a physically-qualified Sardaukar who wanna sign on with the CDOs when doing his BSLC. Just like the top BSLC trainees could be siphoned on to OCS, a newly-contracted regular could be transferred on (rather than do ASLC to complete infantry/guards specializartion).<br><br>Or are things so rigid that they make him redo BMT at Hendon, or exclude him totally for not progressing via the mono-intake route? That's far-fetched.<br><br>[NB. Not advocating advancing conscripted BSLC trainees on to the CDOs, even as an incentive.]<br><br><blockquote>ORD'd a long time ago; my understanding was built from the days when they were all under 7 SIB: 1st GDS/SAFGU, 2nd GDS/8 SIR, 1st CDO, 10th CDO, School of Commando Training, &amp; later 3rd GDS/7 SIR. </blockquote>Those changes were about 5 years before my time, at the start of the '80s or so. It came roughly together with the introduction of the IPPT system, if I recall.<br><br>Browsed through some reference book &amp; spotted the differences between then &amp; now.<br><br>Now :- HQ Infantry takes charge of, for both infantry &amp; Guards, the training of its recruits (via BMTC), specialists (via SISPEC) &amp; reservists (via ITC &amp; BCTC). The CDOs, as well as OCS, are outside of this organizational structure.<br><br>Then :- 7 SIB, while one of 3 "active" brigades, was very much the personification of "kings of combat." It had elite elements like the CDOs &amp; SAFGU (along with 7 SIR &amp; 8 SIR) &amp; also, as I remember, took charge of ITD (predecessor of BMTC) training as well. Its sub-unit, the SCT, led the way in instructor training, particularly grooming NCO trainers who would mentor for the RDF conversion. The CDOs, thus, was very much a prominent "conventional" team player then.<br><br>Also, the SAF emphasis of those days that all servicemen must go through the same BMT - Army, Air Force, Navy; combat, technican, service; elite, non-elite - was one thing that distinguished us from other armed forces, believe it or not.  That's why I presumed there could be some flexibility in training-course continuation, esp. for new regulars (don't make sense if not). With the NSFs, it's certainly applicable, as said, for the top SISPEC trainees-to-OCS route.<br><br></div>
