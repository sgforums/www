            <div class='col-md body'>The French GIGN is the premier police counter-terrorist unit in France.They are rather similarly with the SG Star armed with the MP5 which has been proven to be an effective CQB weapon.Now,the question I have is that,we do realise that most of the units which are engaged in CQB use semi-automatic pistols as they have a larger ammunition capacity,and are easier to reload.Well,it is an interesting fact to know that GIGN troopers are mostly armed with a revolver as a sidearm.The rationale behind GIGN troopers being armed as posted by their webby,was that it encourages the troopers to aim and fire accurate shots and that the fact revolvers never jam compared to semi-autos.<br><br>But does it occur to them that the rate of fire from a revolver is extremely low and it isn't really suitable for CQB where action takes place fast and furious.Besides the reloading of a revolver is a time-consuming process.Anyone who has fired revolvers would know this.And I for one would definitely never go into CQB with a revolver due to the above reasons.<br><br>Anyone has views to share or comments?</div>

But they are French!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Seriously, cases of over-killed by HRTs is actually quite controversial.  As you already know police HRTs or SWATs main objective is to protect lives including those of the tangos.  But there are questionable cases of SWATs actions in which how a tango was killed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Recently, I read in the papers about an Israeli officer being charged for emptying his pistol mag into a palestanian little girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>HM bodyguards are very much like the U.S Secret Service.  When they have to draw their weapon, their main objective is to protect <strong>only</strong> the Queen or President.  They do not have to care about hitting a civilian in the line of duty, unlke cops.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As to how many weapons the GIGN guys carry is really up to them &amp; their SOP. Yup, revolvers can use LTL but I have yet to seen any cop or SpecOps using it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

None of that OODA thingy you mentioned.  You've got to take into account the hours spent by an operator, or SWAT officer, trainning in a kill house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>SWAT guys trainning usually involves holding off the kill unless the threat is significant.  This is very mentally tough trainning as compared to a military operator whose objective is to remove the tango/charlie/indian/etc without prejudice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You're right about different circumstances requiring different handling techniques but you also mentioned SAS, which is a military outfit.  Meaning that military operators don't follow civilian law in handling situations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Did you read about the assassination attempt on the Afghanistan President sometime back?  His BGs then were operators from NEVGrp, the assassin was acutally subdued by 2 members of surrounding afghan.  The NEVGrp operator killed <strong>all</strong>, assassin &amp; heroic afghans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>There was a hooha back in the States over the killing of the 2 heroic Afghan but because of the situation at that time &amp; the fact that the shooter was a SEAL not a SWAT operator.  It didn't amount to anything more then a hooha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
