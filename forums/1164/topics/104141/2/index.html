In fact, the whole incident was shown on Worlds Scariest Police momments.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>There was also an anti-terror case in UK where 2 SAS troopers emptied a total of 30 rounds into an IRA at close range, the guy refused to die so another SAS soldier with an MP-5 finished the job.  During the latter hearing, the SAS troopers said that they taught that the IRA guy was going to trigger his bomb so they had to make sure he die.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
