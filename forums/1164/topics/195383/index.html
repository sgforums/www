            <div class='col-md body'>ST. LOUIS, June 12, 2006 -- The Boeing [NYSE: BA] EA-18G program test team reached a key milestone May 30 when it flew a modified F/A-18F equipped with wingtip antenna and high- and low-band jamming pods for the first time. The flight was part of ongoing flying qualities and carrier suitability testing to validate the EA-18G's shipboard effectiveness. The EA-18G Growler is a derivative of the F/A-18F Super Hornet, that has been flying from carriers since 1997.<br><br>The three-month carrier suitability tests, flown by U.S. Navy pilots, include catapult launches and cable arrestments from test facilities at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Md. Initial tests will measure aircraft loads to verify that the landing gear and airframe meet design specifications. The tests also will monitor the catapult and arrestment systems to assess if the Growler settings are accurate.<br><br>"These tests are a big milestone for the EA-18G program," said Mike Gibbons, Boeing EA-18G program manager. "We know the Super Hornet airframe works well in challenging at-sea conditions. Now we're verifying that the EA-18G, with potentially greater bringback for fuel and weapons capacity, will work just as well."<br><br>Over 25 flights, the carrier suitability tests will measure how well the Growler performs in a variety of takeoff and landing situations, including high sink, free flight engagement, on- and off-center catapults and arrestments. The EA-18G testing will allow for higher landing weights than the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet to provide greater flexibility in the return of high-value jamming pods plus other weapons and stores.<br><br>Boeing, acting as the weapon system integrator and prime contractor, leads the EA-18G Growler industry team. Northrop Grumman is the principal subcontractor and airborne electronic attack subsystem integrator. The Hornet Industry Team will divide EA-18G production across Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Electric and Raytheon manufacturing facilities. The System Design and Development program concludes with an Initial Operational Capability in 2009. Naval Air Systems Command PMA-265 is the U.S. Navy acquisition office for the EA-18G.<br><br><a href="http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q2/060612b_nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2006/q2/060612b_nr.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we still have many old A-4 aircraft, maybe we can outfit them to be dedicated EW aircraft like what the other countries are doing. Old aircraft are often converted to become dedicated EW aircraft.<br><br>Since the air defence in our region is not strong we don't need that many of such EW aircraft, just a handful will do. Can use this as an opportunity to gain experience in intergrating new equipment to old retired aircraft.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Under it falls 3 categories, ELINT (Electronic Intelligence), FISINT (Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence) and COMINT (Communications Intelligence).<br><br>As for Jamming Pods, I'm guessing sooner or later all these dedicated jamming aircraft will also be replaced by UAVs.  If its light enuff to be mounted on the wings of an aircraft, it can probably be made to fly.</div>
