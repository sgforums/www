              <p>From : <a href="http://goodmorningyesterday.blogspot.com/2008/05/ulu-pandan-heritage-trail-7-famous-kota.html"> Good Morning Yesterday</a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">It
              was the crack Indonesian paratroopers from the "KKI", an elite Guards
              unit from Jakarta which was sent on this mission. The Malaysian police
              post at Kota Tinggi were alerted of the parachute-landing and the
              nearest infantry garrison to Kota Tinggi was 2 SIR in Singapore. 1SIR
              at that time was deployed to the Sabah border with Indonesia.<br><br>One
              platoon of 2SIR was sent inside the jungles of Kota Tingi. For those
              who have ventured into Kota Tinggi (which I did as a child and as a
              teenager), it has a waterfall as the key attraction. The killing zone
              was north of the waterfall.<br><br>2SIR made no contact with the
              Indonesians for about a week. However, unknowingly the Indonesians were
              tailing one of the SIR sections. Not finding them for a week, that
              section grew tired and went for a bath at one of the nearby Kota Tinggi
              streams. Everybody left their weapons at the riverbank with no
              personnel on sentry-duty.<br><br>For those trained in the SAF doctrine,
              you are not supposed to do this and at all times, your rifle must be
              with you. The Indonesians pounded on our boys but one injured personnel
              managed to sneak away and ran for his life into Kota Tinggi Town. All
              this time, there was "radio silence" because this was a mission. It was
              only after the injured personnel emerged from the jungle that the
              incident became known. When the dead were recovered, their bodies were
              infested with maggots and were very gruesome<br><br>Reinforcements were
              rushed up from Singapore. On that mission were names like James Teo
              (who was the 5SIR CO for BERSATU PADU in 1971), Jimmy Yap (CO Officer
              Cadet School), Mahinder Singh (Dy Director SAFTI) and Dalgit Singh (CO
              3SIR). They were “young lieutenants” then. James Teo was the unit
              signals officer. This time, the Indonesians scattered in different
              directions. It must have been somewhat of a surprise that no
              Indonesians were caught alive. I leave it to you to guess what must
              have happened next because I saw some of the photographs taken at that
              time. Don't forget our jungle-weapons also included the machete. The
              two Singhs were later involved in the Labis incident and again credited
              with many enemy killings.<br><br>The decomposed bodies were brought
              back to Holland Road Camp for the Malay burial rituals. The slain men
              were given a full-military burial. </span></span><br><br><span style="font-family: verdana; color: #000099;"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5200600677226926546" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_c3QO1YXtcyk/SCw-wxDEUdI/AAAAAAAAA5k/gZgotLJ99AE/s320/2SIR+funeral+at+Biadari+Malay+Cemetery-1965.jpg" border="0" alt=""><span style="color: #000000;">Photo of the funeral at <a href="http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/details/SIP_840_2004-12-20.html">Bidadari Muslim Cemetery</a>.

              <p>This was during the confrontation. 1962-1966.</p>
              <p>The Indonesians sent in terrorists into Malaysia (then inclusive of Singapore) in order to destabilize the region.  Sukarno's didn't really have a strategic plan to accomplish anything at that time, all he wanted was to get rid of the local pressure and redirect it to something abroad.</p>

              <p>Somehow i dont hear this incident being told to us new-generation soldiers. The only time i heard about the Confrontation era is when COL(R)John Morris came down to Tekong to talk about National Education. Most us were dozing off after running SOC in the morning.. The lecture went on till about 5 in the evening. Gd opportunity to catch up on our sleep... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a book which detailed alot of Confrontation era operations during the Sukarno era. Titled "Kopassus: The inside story of Indonesia's special forces" by Ken Conboy. Although its the history of the country's special forces. it also relates operations undertaken by other units during the Confrontation era</p>
