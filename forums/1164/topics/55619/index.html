            <div class='col-md body'>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>August 18, 2003<br><br><strong>Lockheed Martin Commemorates 25th Anniversary Of First Global Production F-16 Delivery</strong><br>See the F-16 Fact Sheet<br><br><img src="http://www.lmtas.com/gallery/products/combat_air/f16/f16_press/03/f16pr030818_lr.jpg"><br><br>Fort Worth, Texas Â— Lockheed Martin [NYSE:LMT] celebrated the first production delivery of its F-16 Fighting Falcon on this date 25 years ago. The F-16 has been one of the most successful military aircraft programs in history and has paved the way for unprecedented partnerships and cooperation among global air forces, governments and industries.<br><br>Since that historic day in 1978, 4,092 F-16s have been produced in factories in five countries (United States, Belgium, Netherlands, Turkey and Korea) and delivered to the air forces of 20 countries. Over the next three years, four additional countries (United Arab Emirates, Chile, Oman and Poland) will receive their first F-16s, for a total of 24 customers worldwide. There is a current backlog of 325 aircraft on order that will deliver through 2008.<br><br>Â“The two main reasons for the F-16Â’s unprecedented success are high capability and affordable cost,Â” said John L. Bean, vice president of F-16 programs. Â“The F-16 started out as a revolutionary fighter in terms of technology, and we have continued to employ the latest technologies to expand and improve its capabilities. Our customers have invested several billion dollars in the last few years in major upgrades to the aircraft, both in production and retrofit, to keep it the most-capable multirole fighter in operation.<br><br>Â“We consider the F-16 to be the most versatile fighter in the world Â– able to perform all combat missions with distinction, employing the worldÂ’s largest inventory of weapons and sensors, and tailored to meet individual customer requirements, as evidenced by 123 different versions produced or in development.<br><br>Â“It is also the worldÂ’s most affordable front-line fighter, having the lowest cost to procure, operate and support. High capability at low cost means tremendous value to every customer.Â”<br><br>Dain M. Hancock, president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., said, Â“The F-16 has been a major source for developing technical competencies for our company that have put us on the path to becoming the worldÂ’s center of excellence for combat aircraft. We have expanded that competency base to now be entrusted with the development of the next generation of fighter aircraft to include the F/A-22 and F-35.Â”<br><br>In addition to the F-16Â’s unmatched performance, the aircraft program is a pioneer in forging international relationships that eventually led to unprecedented cooperation on such programs as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The F-16Â’s legacy includes a historic agreement with Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway in 1975 for the procurement of and coproduction of 348 F-16s in conjunction with the U.S. Air ForceÂ’s original plans to buy 650. Half of the F-16s ordered are for international customers.<br><br>Â“The success of the F-16 and associated international industrial cooperation activities have helped establish Lockheed Martin Corporation as an international partner of choice,Â” said Hancock, who also has the title of corporate executive vice president for Aeronautics. Â“We highly value these relationships, and they have helped launch other international business opportunities for the corporation.<br><br>Â“The F-16 has been a huge success for Lockheed Martin and its predecessor companies in Fort Worth. We expect the F-16 to remain a significant portion of our business for many years. This will involve continued production alongside of the F/A-22 and F-35, plus post-production support and modifications for a large worldwide fleet.Â”<br><br>Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., a business area of Lockheed Martin, is a leader in the design, development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies. Its customers include the military services of the United States and allied countries throughout the world. Products include the F-16, F/A-22, F-35 JSF, F-117, T-50, C-5, C-27J, C-130, C-130J, P-3, S-3 and U-2.<br><br>Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin Corp. employs about 125,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and integration of advanced technology systems, products and services. The corporation reported 2002 sales of $26.6 billion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Advanced Block 50/52 F-16<br>By Mike Nipper<br><br>Continuous evolution and affordability have been keys to the enduring popularity of the F-16 in the world fighter market. New capabilities have regularly been added to the Fighting Falcon over the past three decades by upgrading systems and software as well as by incorporating the latest types of munitions. The F-16 also boasts the lowest total ownership costs of any fourth-generation fighter, including costs associated with development, acquisition, operation and maintenance, and upgrades. The newest variants of the F-16 build on these traditions.<br><br>The latest Fighting Falcons rolling off the Lockheed Martin production line in Fort Worth, Texas, carry the generic label of Advanced Block 50/52 F-16s. This version represents the largest configuration change in program history, a feat that was completed in record time. Additional fuel and payload capacity, new or improved avionics and sensors, color cockpit displays with enhanced pilot/vehicle interfaces, and other important improvements make these aircraft the most capable F-16s produced to date. (USAF Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 F-16s are keeping up with some of these improvements through retrofit in the Common Configuration Implementation Program.)<br><br>So far, six countries have ordered Advanced Block 50/52 F-16s to modernize their fighter forces. Each variant is somewhat country-specific, and some customers have selected their own designations. For example, the lead customer, the Hellenic Air Force, has exclusively adopted the moniker Block 52+ for its versions. The first six of the sixty HAF aircraft on order were delivered to Greece last May. Israel has adopted the designation F-16I to distinguish its Advanced Block 52 variant and has given it the nickname Soufa, meaning storm in Hebrew. All 102 F-16Is will be two-seat versions, and production deliveries begin this fall.<br><br>Advanced Block 50/52 F-16s are difficult to tell from previous F-16s because the differences are primarily on the inside. The following categories detail some of the more significant changes.<br><br>Conformal Fuel Tanks<br>The most distinguishing external feature of an Advanced Block 50/52, when installed, is a set of conformal fuel tanks attached to the upper fuselage. All of these latest F-16s have structural, plumbing, and wiring provisions for the conformal tanks. The tank set holds 450 gallons (more than 3,000 pounds) of additional JP-5/8. The extra fuel increases range, loiter time, and combat persistence as well as reduces the demand for tanker support. Range increase is on the order of twenty to forty percent, depending on the stores configuration and mission profile.<br><br>The conformals, which can be used in lieu of wing tanks, free the inner wing store stations and can double the primary air-to-ground payload. The tanks have an imperceptible effect on the F-16Â’s agility, handling qualities, flight limits, and signature. Moreover, the tanks do not interfere with daily inspections and servicing, and the impact on maintenance access is minimal. A complete set can be removed or replaced in two hours by a small crew and a hoist.<br><br>600-Gallon Wing Tanks<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 variant is certified to carry the 600-gallon wing fuel tanks. These tanks increase range or persistence up to thirty percent over the standard 370-gallon wing tanks. The tanks are mounted on non-jettisonable pylons that can also carry the more common 370-gallon tanks.<br><br>Landing Gear<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 versions have heavy-weight landing gear designed for up to 52,000 pounds maximum takeoff gross weight.<br><br>Radar<br>A major enhancement is the Northrop Grumman APG-68(V)9 multimode radar, one of the most advanced radars in the skies today. This radar has more than fivefold faster processing speed and tenfold greater memory capacity over the previous APG-68(V)7/8 radar. The new processors have even higher growth potential.<br><br>A high-resolution synthetic aperture radar mode allows the pilot to locate and recognize tactical ground targets from considerable distances. In conjunction with inertially aided weapons, such as GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition, the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon, and CBU-103/104/105 Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser, the F-16 gains an enhanced capability for all-weather precision strike from standoff distances. The radar features an inertial measurement unit that improves dynamic tracking performance and provides an auto-boresight capability, which increases accuracy and eliminates the need for time-consuming mechanical boresighting.<br><br>Air-to-air improvements in-clude a thirty percent increase in detection range and improvements in functionality and tracking quality in various modes.<br><br>Radar reliability is increased by fifty percent to nearly 400 hours mean time between failures. Commercial off-the-shelf technology is expected to improve supportability significantly. Using off-the-shelf technology resolves existing issues with availability and cost of spare parts and also makes technology refreshes more affordable.<br><br>Targeting System<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 can employ the latest generation targeting systems, such as the Lockheed Martin Sniper XR/Pantera targeting pod that is mounted on the right inlet sensor station. In conjunction with laser-guided bombs, the pod provides day/night precision strikes from high altitudes. Among other uses, the targeting systems can be used for seeker cueing of a variety of guided weapons and covert air-to-air operations.<br><br>Navigation and Reconnaissance Pods<br>A navigation pod, such as LANTIRN/Pathfinder, can be fitted to the left inlet sensor station. A variety of reconnaissance pods can be carried on the centerline fuselage station.<br><br>Cockpit<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 cockpit features a helmet-mounted cueing system, color multifunction displays and recording equipment, cockpit lighting and external strip lighting compatible with night vision goggles, and large-capacity data transfer sets.<br><br>A choice of helmet-mounted cueing systems is available. These systems allow a pilot to direct sensors or weapons to his line of sight or to help him find a designated target. The helmet display also provides critical flight and target information to the pilot Â— similar to a head-up display, but in any direction the pilot looks.<br><br>Dorsal Avionics Compartment<br>All two-seat models of the Advanced Block 50/52 have a distinctive dorsal avionics compartment that allows these aircraft to accommodate all of the systems of the single-seat model as well as some special mission equipment and additional chaff/flare dispensers. The rear cockpit can be configured for either a weapon system operator or an instructor pilot and can be converted with a single switch in the cockpit.<br><br>Communication, Navigation, and Identification<br>A variety of options are available in radio communication and navigation systems, including UHF, VHF AM/FM, HF, satellite communication, tactical air navigation, VHF omnidirectional receiver, distance measuring equipment, and instrument landing system. An integrated precision navigation suite consisting of a ring laser gyro inertial navigation system, global positioning system, and a digital terrain system is standard.<br><br>A choice of data link systems is offered, including the NATO-standard Link 16, in addition to the data modem associated with the UHF/VHF radios. Link 16 provides secure, jam-resistant, high-volume data exchange on a multi-node network.<br><br>A standard feature on all F-16s today is a combined friend from foe interrogator/ transponder, which permits autonomous identification to maximize launch ranges of radar-guided air-to-air missiles.<br><br>Core Avionics and Central Computer<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 offers two different core avionics hardware and software architectures. Some aircraft have the modular mission computer, while other customers have opted for the latest general avionics computer. This generation of avionics computers benefits from technology advances including increased processing speeds and mem-ory capacity. They also incorporate off-the-shelf technology, which improves supportability, provides refresh roadmaps, and reduces future development costs. Some versions have a high-speed fiber optic data bus, which provides large growth potential for data throughput.Countermeasures<br><br>Equipment<br>All Advanced Block 50/52 versions have modern internal electronic countermeasures systems. The Greek aircraft have the Advanced Self-Protection Integrated Suite, which consists of the Northrop Grumman ALR-93 radar warning receiver and electronic warfare controller, the Raytheon ALQ-187 RF jammer, and the BAE Systems ALE-47 chaff/ flare dispenser. The Israeli aircraft have an electronic warfare suite produced by Elisra. Most other Advanced Block 50/52 customers will have the ITT Advanced Internal Defensive Electronic Warfare System. These systems provide integrated electronic counter-measures, radar warning, and chaff/flare dispensing for self-protection against a wide range of threats. Internal mounting (in place of a countermeasure pod) eliminates drag, provides full spherical antenna coverage, and frees up an external station for other stores.<br><br>Engines<br>The Advanced Block 50/52 aircraft have a common engine bay that allows customers a choice of engines in the 29,000-pound thrust class. The Block 50s are powered by the General Electric F110-GE-129 and have the Modular Common Inlet Duct (known as the large mouth inlet). The Block 52s are powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 and have a Normal Shock Inlet (known as the small mouth inlet).<br><br>On-Board Oxygen Generation<br>An on-board oxygen-generating system replaces the liquid oxygen system of earlier versions to provide breathable air to the pilot. The system improves maintainability, deployability, and safety<br><br>Other Equipment Options<br>Besides those alternatives already mentioned, F-16 customers still have the option of a drag chute, paint schemes, and the worldÂ’s largest inventory of certified storesÂ—more than 100 items certified in approximately 5,000 configurations. The Advanced Block 50/52s are capable of delivering the US family of GPS-guided precision weapons and a variety of high-off-boresight air-to-air missiles, including the AIM-9X Sidewinder, IRIS-T, and Python IV.<br><br>Mike Nipper is Manager of Enterprise Communications at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company in Fort Worth.<br><br><a href="http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/2003/articles/jul_03/block50-52/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeonemagazine.com/archives/2003/articles/jul_03/block50-52/index.html</a></div>
