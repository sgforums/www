              <p><em>Cultural Cleansing in Iraq</em> Edited by Raymond W. Baker, Shereen T. Ismael, and Tareq Y. Ismael. Pluto, 296 pp. $34.95</p>
              <p>THIS
              BOOK argues convincingly that the post- war cultural cleansing of Iraq
              is intentional rather than random and haphazard, the result of chaos
              and anarchy.</p>
              <p>The aim of the policy of cultural cleansing is to
              remake Iraq into a US-friendly state and enable Washington’s returned
              Shia and Kurd exiles to take and exercise power.</p>
              <p>In the first of
              10 chapters, the editors contend that the Bush administration’s
              objectives were to demonstrate US global dominance and remake “the
              strategic Middle East” to suit the US. “To that end, the invasion of
              Iraq would display America’s crushing military power to a world reduced
              to the status of spectators in a spectacle of a state’s destruction,
              marked by massive civilian casualties, cultural devastation and the
              pauperisation of its people.”</p>
              <p>Subsequent chapters show how Iraq’s
              state structures were systematically destroyed along with the
              independent secular nationalist socialist regime.</p>
              <p>This began with
              the looting of the country’s museums and libraries, schools and
              universities. Although Iraqis carried out most of the pillage and
              destruction, the US was responsible for what took place.</p>
              <p>Scholars
              had warned the White House and Pentagon that this would happen if
              vulnerable sites were not protected. Nothing was done because,
              according to Barbara Bodine, Washington’s first post-war ambassador,
              orders had been issued to the effect that looting should be allowed to
              proceed unchecked. In some cases, US troops broke open the doors of
              institutions to aid looters.</p>
              <p>The US also used major archaeological sites, including ancient Babylon and Ur, as military bases, inflicting irreparable damage.</p>
              <p>By
              attacking the country’s history and “collective memory”, Zainab Bahrani
              holds that the US sought to undermine the unique national identity of
              Iraqis. Their strong sense of history and culture has made them the
              most inventive poets, writers and painters in the Arab world.</p>
              <p>The second half of the book focuses on the killing of Iraqi intellectuals and professionals.</p>
              <p>As
              early as April 11th, 2003, two days after the fall of Baghdad, a group
              of university professors and scientists dispatched an e-mail saying
              that the occupation forces had drawn up lists of individuals for
              detention, harassment and elimination. Since then, hundreds of
              university processors, doctors and scientists have been assassinated,
              kidnapped, killed or driven into exile.</p>
              <p>The murder of Dr Muhammad
              Rawi, a medical doctor and chancellor of Baghdad University in July
              2003, shocked the country and served as a warning to others in the
              intelligentsia.</p>
              <p>Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency and the
              Iranian-founded Iraqi Badr Corps militia were initially blamed for the
              killings. However, the book’s contributors provide solid evidence that
              the US and Britain fostered the decimation of the intellectuals because
              they would resist foreign domination through Shia and Kurd proxies who
              rode into Baghdad on the backs of US tanks.</p>
              <p>The vehicle for the
              purge of intellectuals was the de-Baathification campaign instituted by
              Paul Bremer, the US pro-consul from 2003-2004, and used by successive
              Shia-led sectarian governments to target secular nationalist thinkers
              of every sect.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The US is accused of using the “Salvador option”,
              a strategy evolved in Central America, to create US-compliant regimes
              in that region.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>13 authors of this work say the US set out to
              destroy Iraq’s national identity, reduce and marginalise the educated
              class and wipe the Iraqi slate clean in order to build from ground zero
              a weak state which would be dependent on the US. </strong></span></p>
              <p>This experiment in
              “state ending” has left a black hole at the heart of the eastern Arab
              world.</p>
