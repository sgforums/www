            <div class='col-md body'>that is provided if she can pass the selection. no offence taken yuh =). anyway to the bro who says that STAR selection so siong might as well join S O F instead, I can assure you that the selection there is as tough if not tougher.<br>STAR being a law enforcing unit doesn't shoot to kill..they must always ensure the safety of human lives. SOF has a totally directive in this sense cause it is a military unit. Well, conditions do apply..</div>
