There were 2 that caught my attention, one is the "diving assualt gear" - I didn't know that STAR performed any diving ops. I always thought that the NDU would be the only one. The second one was the "maritime assault gear" - which showed a type of urban light coloured tiger stripped uniform. I've never seen it being used before. Does anybody have more info on these??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe compared to police units like GIGN and HK SDU, they're relatively unknown. Yes, they're the local equivalent of a SWAT team.<br><br>But they're quite familiar in Singapore. The recent hostage taking incident at the bungalow, they were there. There was even a picture of them debussing from their van.<br><br>And if you looked through the achievements at their web site, it's actually quite impressive.<br><br>SQ117 was SOF. SOF go for more dangerous criminals equipped with deadlier weapons and their missions are more political in nature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's both fortunate and a waste that they were never able to show their real skills.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think a STAR member died in the line of duty. I cannot remember clearly but many years back, I watched a crime watch episode. There was this drug addict who stabbed a police officer, snatched his revolver and ran off. The officer was seriously wounded. The police activated STAR and they began hunting for this armed and dangerous man. There was a shootout in a forest and one STAR member was shot dead. His team members then finished him off. Anyone remember this incident?</div>

So it should be a headshot. ANyway that STAR guy received a full state burial.</div>
