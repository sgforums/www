Further than that, the picture presented is too small. So it is typically more reflexive for your eye to focus at the same particular position. Play with it next time, you get a feel for it.<br><br>Physics lah, it's not as much as for blackeye.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a way u can say that.  Like mentioned, there is a optimal distance to place ur eye behind the scope.  Too far and u cant really see... cos the sight picture would shift too drastically.  Its supposed to be a very natural position once u are accustomed to it.<br><br>Fool-proof? Well I'm not sure. Ideally the SAR-21 is supposed to be weapon where u can just pick up and use without care for individual zeroing. Eg, ur buddy die, ur weapon jam, use ur buddy's one first. Haha.<br><br>Question is, how does having an idiot proof weapon contradict the notion of having a thinking soldier?  In fact, i think it helps a soldier to thiink rather than making him dumber.  When u have a reliable, and easy to use weapon, the soldier can concentrate on "fighting" rather than thinking of how to use his weapon.<br><br></div>

Is the point of the shoulder where the butt sits perfectly rigid?  One would be hard-pressed to imagine that the muscle tissue in the deltoid lacks the hardness of a brick, and therefore some shift occurs when the force of recoil is applied to it.  This applies to a greater extent with sniper rifles, but even with an automatic weapon the weapon will shift slightly.<br><br>Experienced shooters acknowledge that and therefore keep a respectful between their eye and the end of the scope.</div>

So there is definitely a minimal distance in order to look thru it properly.<br><br>2nd of all, the cheek is supposed to be resting on the weapon.  THe recoil will probably gently push ur cheek together with ur entire body back a bit.<br><br>My prev unit had one super lai jiao CPT that always tell us to bring our nose such that it touches the charging handle of our m-16.  It works fairly well, tho we were concerned that the recoil will wack our nose, or wadever.<br><br>According to him, and I've personally tried and proven, that the recoil wont do that to u.
