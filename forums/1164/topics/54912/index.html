            <div class='col-md body'>I had just installed and played the game less than 24 hours ago. There are a lots of things that i don't know. Would like to asked you for tips and advice about the game. How do i decrease my tax make it lower. My tax now is normal. How can i increase the birth rate of my peasant. I'm having a negative growth in population. 13 peasants were born but 15 peasants died. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Are you still there?

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To change Tax rate, use cmd "set tax &lt;0,500,1000,1500 or 2000&gt;". for eg if you want to set taxes to 2000copper per castle during every housekeeping, then use "set tax 2000".<br><br>to increase peasant birthrate, lower your taxes below Normal, means set to either 500 or 0 copper per castle. More taxes means more peasants will die less born.<br><br>I'm playing with character "tje", you can send me messages using cmd "message tje blah blah....".

            <div class='col-md body'>To help you get started, here are some tips<br><br>You can start to play by going to the website http://www.conquestgamesite.com. There are 3 ways to play:<br>1) IRC log on to irc.undernet.org and then join #conquest. From there send a message "/msg conquest newplayer" to create a player. Your nick will be your character's name. Then follow the instruction to change your password.<br>2) Telnet from the website, and follow the instructions given<br>3) Directly from the web pages, webpage playing, and follow the instructions.<br><br>More commonly used commands are :<br>1. Person<br>2. Review<br>3. Info<br>4. Kia<br>5. Rank<br>6. Population<br>7. Quest<br>8. Attack<br>9. buy item/sell item<br>10. buy (from the cities market)<br>11. travel<br><br>The manuals on the website is very helpful but may not be very updated, so I suggest just fiddle around with the cmds and use the Help menu (cmd "help").<br><br>It gets very exciting when you reach lvl 3 because you can change class to mage, cleric, barbarian, vampire or ranger.<br><br>Note: From the website, there is the Log section, very useful to see what is going on in the game.<br><br>Tje</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is always good to build up before attacking others.<br><br>One very good way to build up from lvl 1 (A Knight) is to quest for items "quest item" as it only takes two move pts. Try to get the "Ring of limited wishes" item, and then wish for land (need land to build more castles and then can shelter more troops). This game is run on move points, no mv pts means cannot do anything. From the "info", you can check when the mv pts will be distributed again (every 15 mins).<br><br>There are many items in the realm, some are mentioned on the website under magical items. The most powerful is the "Orb of Safety", as this item makes you become protected by the Emperor, means  no one can attack you. (After you initiate a battle, you will no longer be protected). You can also get protection if you level.<br><br>Also, when you are going to attack, use the "set surrender" cmd and change your surrender to 100 (100%), so that your troops won't surrender and flee when your troops gets 25% death (default is set at 25%).<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Tje</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi want to know,<br><br>I played the game for quite sometimes aready. I got the advance cmds not in the manuals from the news (cmd "news") in conquest. To validate, "/msg conquest validate ". Remember that your irc nick must be the character's name.<br><br>There is also the house-keeping to take note of. The reason why your items disappear is because of the New Year House-Keeping or NYHK for short. There are 4 HKs, and the NYHK is singapore time 6am daily. The others are at 11am, 6pm and 12mn daily. Items do not disappear during the normal HK. What the HK does is renew all the moves pts for you (so you have moves), renew your number of attacks, your peasants produce food, your troops consume food, and various price changes in all the cities. There will be a lot of activities going on during HK, such as pple attacking, etc...Because everyone is fresh with move pts. Moves pts are allocated every 15 mins also (5 pt every 15 mins). To check this, use cmd "info".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there! Thanks for the advice very useful. Woodelf just attack me. I'm going to be dead soon anyway. I see that you are doing very well in the game. Do you still have the protection of the emperor?<br><br>Any tips or advice to give me on how to stay alive in the game? May be i will restart as a newplayer. Won't be doing anything that will make me lose the protection of emperor. The players out there are just too powerful. I think i will keep the protection of the emperor till the end of the age. Coward Huh? No choice. Very difficult to survive without the protection. The moment i lose the protection of emperor i was attacked almost immediately.<br><br>The woodelf that attacked me has more than 21,000 troops and is increasing. I don't think i stand a chance. May be i will do better the next age.<br><br>Thanks! Please reply soon!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Want to know,<br><br>The safest way is to stay protected all the time. But that will mean it is difficult to advance. Try to find an ally, or more. The more the better. You can send messages to people playing and ask about forming a formal alliance to help each other.<br><br>Well, for me, I have become a vampire, so I changed my name every HK.<br><br>Conquest is a very fast paced, very political game as well. Don't be afraid to die, as the game is free!
