            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Moca, cool it dude...<br><br>I know it is quite frustrating but I see your point, the .5 is being used by many infantries around the world including the US for the support role, just like the 40mm AGL - which also weigh a ton.<br><br>I really do think that our tanks should mount .5 HMGs. The .5 is IDEAL for fast moving soft-skinnned vehicles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>moca,<br>the cannister rd's effective range is about 200m, with 1200 pieces of 9mm steel balls.since the HE round is an over kill, than bo bian right? it is up to the commander tio bo?<br><br>WE all AGREE that a 50 is great for soft skin mobile targets (rovers, Humvees, LSV),<br>what u are asking is WHY are we not attaching them to the tanks rite? (from ur first post).<br>The Co-Ax slot cannot fit a 50 so we'll leave it out. the interior of the SM1 is cramp enough as it is. The very most what the SM1 can mod is the commander's pintle so that it can hold a 50 instead. but one has to consider that the turret top doesn't have that much space for a HMG. (see pic).<br><img src="http://orbat.com/site/cimh/regiments/8CAVALRY/amx13.gif"><br><br>u mentioned that the VC dismantaled the 50. sure it is a v smart and effective way to transport a heavy equipment. so are u suggesting that one can strip the 50 and get a sect to carry it? or are u suggesting that the 50 be transported by vehs/bikes?<br><br>cool it man. if u do not want to discuss than Fine, MOD, please close.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly i will like to say that due to my inability to divulge any SOPs for tank crews, i can only contribute my views based on common sense and knowledge avaliable in public domain.<br><br>The SM1 have 2 MGs and can fire HE and CAN rounds as mentioned earlier. CAN rds are mainly for anti-personnel use but can shoot at B vehicles if they are within the effective range of the CAN rds and that there are no friendly troops around. HE is effective for all B vehicles and APCs but not the MBTs. The two MG can be used against infantry and B vehicles.<br><br>In my opinion these weapons are at the disposal of the tank crew to engage the enemy so its up to the tank commander's discretion to decide what is appropriate to be used to fulfil his objective and mission.<br><br>For example, he can choose to order the gunner to fire a HE round at a troop carrying military truck then spray it with MG to kill those troops escaping from the wreackage. Or he can just fire the CAN round at it if at close range and subsequently spray with MG. These are just some examples of different combinations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But note that all those instances you mentioned, they were then placed in a static position.  If an infantry unit is in a defensive or static position, sure by all means bring them along.<br><br>But in a fluid fire and movement or movement to contact, do you really want to lug a .50 HMG with you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Probably POI-orientated units should have HMG as for domination of ground froms static position.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>moca, you have to give some space for other people to discuss. Stop putting people down before they could even discuss any furthur. It makes things very messy, and it is as good as you discussing with yourself. I don't want to see such behavior anymore otherwise i will close this thread.<br><br>1st warning.</div>
