            <div class='col-md body'>what happened is that Malaysia Organised a live firing Artillery Exercise on our National Day somewhere in Johore. Of all days they must hold it on our National Day.<br><br>So Singapore told Malaysia that if intelligence reports that the Arty was facing Singapore, Singapore would be forced to take action. Troops were on high alert that day wtih tanks lined up along the Johore Straights ready to move into Malaysia at a moments notice.<br><br>This is one of the many conflicts that are taught if u are posted to certain units in the SAF, I was lucky to be in one and got to know some stuff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yeah,, another interesting note is that when that crisis with the Live Firing Artillery started,<br><br>the NS men being mobalised were all issued Brand New Weapons and equipment. The Weapons had already been zeroed and the equipment all up to date. I've talked to a few people who were involved. And it looks like the SAF has a stock pile of weapons and equipment to be issued when it looks like a conflict will erupt.<br><br>So none of those crap old M16s or 940 sets for war, Brand New ones for us!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia denies threatening war<br><br>Monday 27 January 2003, 18:05PM<br><br>Malaysia has denied it had threatened war with neighbouring Singapore over a series of disputes, dismissing complaints by the island-state's foreign minister.<br><br>"Malaysia has never talked about war. We have never said that we would go to war," said Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.<br><br>"In a conflict situation, we would like to negotiate, and if we cannot agree, we refer it to a third party. That's always been our approach. We have no intention of declaring war with anybody."<br><br>However, he said, "we are always talking about defending our rights and sovereignty".<br><br>Singapore on Saturday denounced "loose talk of war" by politicians and the media in Malaysia over a series of bilateral disputes, calling it irresponsible and dangerous.<br><br>Singapore's Foreign Minister S Jayakumar cited a statement by Syed Hamid who was quoted by the official Bernama news agency on December 31 as saying that Singapore has only two choices -- compromise or go to war.<br><br>He also said that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in his New Year's Day message, had warned that Kuala Lumpur would give a "bloody nose" to any country that violated its sovereignty.<br><br>Jayakumar noted that Malaysian navy and police vessels had increased their "intrusions" into Singapore territorial waters off the disputed island of Pedra Branca, which Malaysia calls Batu Puteh, over the past month.<br><br>The two countries have agreed to refer that dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.<br><br>Another irritant is the price of water supplied by Malaysia to the resource-starved island, and Syed Hamid denounced Singapore's publication of letters on the subject from Mahathir to former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>"What are they trying to prove? I think that is lack of good faith. These letters can be published when writing memoirs or something like that," Syed Hamid said, adding that the move seemed to mean Singapore had no intention of finding a solution to the dispute.<br><br>The two sides have had a testy relationship since Singapore was expelled from the Malaysian Federation and gained independence in 1965.<br><br>Other disputes include a proposed new bridge linking the two countries, the use of Malaysian airspace by Singaporean aircraft and the location of Malaysia's customs, immigration and quarantine facilities in Singapore.<br><br><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/27/1043533999188.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/27/1043533999188.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia Is Singapore's Punching Bag<br><br>JOHOR BHARAU, Jan 27 (Bernama) -- Singapore under pressure from its own people to fix its lagging economy is trying to divert their attention by using Malaysia as a punching bag, said several Johor residents.<br><br>"In last night's television news it is clear the Singaporeans are taught to criticise and slam Malaysia, so they have other avenues to vent their anger besides their own government," Mohd Salleh Ali, an insurance company manager, told Bernama.<br><br>Singapore, he said, is exploiting the controversial Pulau Batu Puteh and the water issue to spread its hate propoganda towards Malaysia.<br><br>Besides, PAP Youth had created a website to discuss about a possible war with its neighbour, said Mohd Salleh.<br><br>Tanjung Kupang State Assemblyman Datuk Baharom Abdul Ghani when contacted by Bernama also said the republic would do anything to veil its economic weakness.<br><br>"Its easy for Singapore to arouse its people's anger towards another country rather than explaining about its economy that is yet to recover."<br><br>Johor Baharu Umno Youth is also disappointed with Singapore leaders hostile attitude towards Malaysia.<br><br>"It is not new for Singapore to twist the facts and Malaysian leaders' statments for their own benefit. Surely PAP do not want to be defeated in the next general election.<br><br>"Singaporeans, young and old, interviewed in last night's programme was clearly taught to say those things," said its acting chief Mohd Khatim Othman.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kempas State Assemblyman Osman Sapian said Malaysians have been too patient with the island's accusation that our leaders are bullying Singapore.<br><br>"The people of Singapore must open their eyes...who is bullying who. When the land premium of the Malaysian Royal Navy base in Woodlands was increased several times, it was Singapore that bullied Malaysia which tried to eject us out of the place," he said.<br>-- BERNAMA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysian politicans and media apparently suffer from a form of short term memory disorder, where they cannot remember anything they did more then a few days ago. Just a few weeks ago they are war-mongering, and now they warn us that doing the same would be "dangerous and disrespectful". Crazy, and they were just responding to some comments posted by unknowns on the internet. As usual, their immaturity shows their full colours. Why immature? Because they are acting like kids who did not get their favourite toy on christmas morning. Even when you show them the facts in letter and writing and expose them in full, they still contuine on their rethoric, apparently not even bothering to use a single ounce of logic besides a single line of behaviour code, and that is "if I do not feel good, it must be all their fault and they must be in the wrong!"<br><br></div>
