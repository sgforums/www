              Anyway, he does highlight a very disturbing situation in case of an anti-China conflict, a potentially huge fifth columnist movement with Chinese FT. Do we incarcerate, repatriate? Leave free? Allow to join the defence?
              
              Almost like the Malays in Army problem in the 60s.

              <p>Those who have little knowledge about left wing politics, history and current international affairs will have difficulties following my political line.</p>
              <p>For example Underpaid. His knowledge about current international politics is limited, so he cannot follow my line of reasoning.</p>
              <p>But this cannot be blamed because Singapore state media which is pro west hardly covers the anti-imperialist or left wing line of thinking.</p>
              <p>You see most of the political journalists in ST covering international affairs. They are mostly ang moh. They follow the pro west line. Very few Singaporean writers would write on international issues. The Singapore press is cowardly in this way, don't dare to express their own views. Hide behind ang moh writers.</p>
              <p>Those non political people go and read this type of pro western propaganda will be influenced.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #373f4b; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">This aspiration grew out of the neo-Marxist political economy theory of the 1960s, which argued that the international trading system was condemning the "periphery"--Latin America and other developing countries--to poverty, exploitation and dependency.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #373f4b; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Among other measures, the NIEO specifically called for a system of price supports for a number of key developing country commodity exports, indexation of developing country export prices to developed countries' manufactured exports, technology transfer and the negotiated redeployment of some developed country industries to developing nations.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #373f4b; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">By the 1980s, the NIEO agenda at the UN had foundered due to divergences in developing country interests, the inability to replicate OPEC's success with other commodities and, most importantly, the discrediting of its command-based economic theories. This was evidenced by the astonishing success of Taiwan, South Korea and others that pursued trade liberalization and export-led growth.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 20px; color: #373f4b; text-align: -webkit-auto; border: 0px initial initial;">Thirty years later, at Cancun, many officials opined that the harsh rhetoric employed by major developing countries such as Brazil and India, as well as smaller African and Caribbean countries, was strongly reminiscent of the 1970s UNCTAD experience. </p>

              <p>Early 70s, the developing world saw that the U.S was bogged down in Vietnam and was in recession and U.S morale was disrupted, so they launched their attack to destroy the U.S system. This attack failed.</p>
              <p>2009 onwards, U.S was bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan and was in an economic recession, so the second round, this time under the BRIC bloc was launched.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">In Yekaterinburg, Russia, India, China and Brazil vowed to turn their four-way group into a powerful political and economic instrument for changing the world. “We are the world’s fastest-growing economies, we have many common interests in the globalised world and share many views on how to build a more democratic, fair and stable world,” Lavrov said at a joint press conference after the BRIC conference.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee hailed BRIC as a “unique combination of mutually complementary economies” and a platform to promote energy and food security, fight terrorism and reform global political and financial bodies.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“We are changing the way the world order is organised,” echoed the Brazilian Foreign Minister.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">The joint communique said the four Ministers “confirmed the aspirations of the BRIC countries to work together with each other and other states in the interests of strengthening international security and stability”.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The principles that the BRIC Ministers laid down for resolving global problems are clearly at variance with the unilateral stand of the U.S.-dominated Western organisations.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"><a href="http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2512/stories/20080620251205200.htm">http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2512/stories/20080620251205200.htm</a></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">U.S and the west will oppose the south from joining forces to destroy their western order.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">They will continue to divide up the states, set India against China and sow discord to prevent the status quo which serves their interests from being disrupted.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px; text-align: -webkit-auto;">I hope the U.S fails in their plots.</p>

              international issues. The Singapore press is cowardly in this way,
              don't dare to express their own views. Hide behind ang moh

              BRIC all wants to destroy western centric bullcrap. Their economies depend on the US, in part or in whole.
              
              Your politics and international knowledge is 40 years out of date.
              
              Example.
              
              If China drives the US economy down, what do you think is going to happen to their own reserves? WHICH ARE PRIMARILY IN US TREASURY BONDS?
              
              Brazil? Where do you think is their closest, biggest market? The US. You think they'd ship to China when there is such a big market next door?
              
              India, it's biggest conflict area is with China, it doesn't have competing teritory claims with the US.
              
              Left wing politics is exactly that, SOCIALISTIC politics, not flights of fantasy which don't take into account international situations and economies. You're thinking left wing = paradise and magical fufillment. It isn't.

              <p>JWYSS@MIAMIHERALD.COM
              BOGOTA -- Amid escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf and a growing diplomatic squabble in the Americas, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad received a red carpet welcome in Venezuela Monday as he kicked off a four-nation Latin American tour that is raising concerns in Washington, D.C.</p>
              <p>Ahmadinejad’s visit, which will also take him to Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador, comes a day after the U.S. Department of State confirmed that Venezuela’s consul in Miami was asked to leave the country amid reports that she took part in a 2008 discussion about a potential cyber-attack against the United States.</p>
              <p>It also comes the same day Iran was accused of stepping up its efforts to enrich uranium, and Iran’s courts announced a former U.S. Marine was condemned to death on spying charges.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Calling Ahmadinejad his “real brother,” Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said the two nations had to stand together against the United States and her allies.
              “We didn’t ask for this task, but it’s our duty to stop the crazed imperialism that is stronger than ever before,” he said. “It’s a danger to the world — these pretensions of the Yankee Empire to control the globe.”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>The escalating rhetoric came as the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had started enriching uranium at a new fortified bunker.</p>
              <p>Iran claims its nuclear program is peaceful, but the international community is increasingly concerned about its military ambitions and has been ratcheting up economic sanctions.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Ahmadinejad said his nation was prepared for “martyrdom” but that it had no bellicose intentions.
              “</span></span></strong>We love everyone,” he said, on the steps of the presidential palace, “including the people of the United States who are suffering under the domination of the arrogant.”</p>
              <p>Chávez said the U.S. and its “lackeys” were trying to paint Iran and Venezuela as the aggressors.
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“Who has dropped thousands and thousands of bombs on innocent civilians — including some atomic bombs? Who has promoted coups, massacres and genocide?” Chávez asked. “Not us. We are among the countries that have been victims.”...</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>That's a strange contention. China needs US as much as US needs China. Same reason why China funds US treasury needs and US trades significantly with China.</p>
              <p>US global economic and political leadership is a reality. China did absolutely zilch in obstructing US interests aka wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya even though China has a security council veto.</p>
              <p>US needs China to be public enemy number 1 cos no other country exerts the influence to justify US$700billion in defense spending every year. That's only for defense spending purposes. Trade wise, China is ironically &amp; probably closer to the US than Europe is. US needs China to sustain economic growth cos that propels the US economy as well.</p>
              <p>Being pro-China doesn't make one automatically anti-US.</p>
