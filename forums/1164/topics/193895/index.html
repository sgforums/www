Sukhoi plans to hand over Malaysia's first batch of six Su-30MKMs next March and Klementiev says all 18 aircraft will be delivered "within one year".<br><br>Sukhoi and Russia's Rosoboronexport sales agency are now also working with the air force to establish a service centre in Malaysia, which is required to open before delivery of the last fighter. Several Malaysian companies including RSK MiG-29 maintenance provider Aerospace Technology System have expressed interest in operating the new facility, but Klementiev says it will be air force-operated during a one-year warranty period, which could also be extended. "For the foreseeable future it will be operated by the Royal Malaysian Air Force."<br><br>Klementiev says Sukhoi is now discussing with the air force a training schedule for its initial batch of Su-30MKM pilots and is also developing a simulator with assistance from Malaysian firm HeiTech Padu. Malaysia also last week signed a letter of intent with India's Hindustan Aeronautics covering training of Su-30 mechanics.<br><br>Malaysia is launch customer for Sukhoi's new Su-30MKM configuration, which features head-up and multifunction displays from Thales. <strong><span style="color: red;">Sukhoi blames Malaysia's late selection of Thales for earlier forcing first deliveries to slip from 2006 until next year, but does not anticipate any problems with integrating the French avionics.</span></strong> The design bureau says it has already received parts from Thales for configuration development and tests are to take place later this year. Thales is now training Malaysian company Zetro to handle maintenance of Su-30MKM avionics, the company says. Klementiev says Sukhoi is in discussion with several customers potentially interested in acquiring a similar configuration to the Su-30MKM, including Indonesia, which is negotiating the purchase of up to 14 aircraft.<br><br>Rosoboronexport declines to confirm that Malaysia is discussing an attrition purchase of two MiG-29s.<br></div>

Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who is also Defence Minister, said Malaysia would hold discussions with India on the possibility of training for its Sukhoi pilots and cooperating on maintenance of aircraft as well as spare parts. Â“The aircraft used by both countries is the same, although the avionics on the Indian version are slightly different,Â” he told Malaysian journalists covering his week-long visit to India. Najib said Malaysia was also looking at working with India on the training of crew and maintenance of its Scorpene submarines scheduled to be delivered in 2009. Malaysia bought two of the state-of-the-art stealth submarines at a cost of US$580mil (RM2bil) each and they are being built by European naval shipbuilders DCN International in Cherbourg, France, and by Izar at Cartagena, Spain.
