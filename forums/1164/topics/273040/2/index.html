            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, so probably, SAF will be the 1st force in this region to deploy advanced 3G long range SAMs, simply because Singapore being a city state, naturally is much more vulnerable than other states in the periphery, especially those countries are in the procession of acquiring cruise missiles with land attacking capability. MAF is interested in Brahmos, TNI purchased some Chinese made C-802 and some reports saying Indon is now developing a land attacking cruise missile based on C802,   TNI also is looking at possible  Russian made SS-N-26 Yakhont buy, a predecessor of Brahmos. In view of all these new developments around, I guess,  if anyone does purchase a NG long range SAMs firstly, it will be SAF. Appearance of LACM does presenting a shift in status quo if anyone wants to argue.<br><br>BTW, KS-1A which MAF could probably be its 1st customer, is still a MR SAM with 50kms maximum.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Weapon system evolve and countries would have to constantly upgrade thier arsenal. It is a temporal issue all countries have to grapple with.<br><br><blockquote>BTW, KS-1A which MAF could probably be its 1st customer, is still a MR SAM with 50kms maximum.  </blockquote>Oh come on, talk is cheap. Will they take 10-20 years to consider this like many of thier other equipment? It could possibly be obsolete by then.<br><br>Nevertheless, it proves that cost is a great issue for countries with small budgets when it comes to purchasing such items. Malaysia would have opted for a more capable but expensive system otherwise.</div>
