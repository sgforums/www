Den go for dinner n wait for ur other non RT platoon mate to book in. Waste so much time but actually only train for one hour. Only for wayang purpose as RT is recommended by OC of the company hence no choice lan lan have to show him...</div>

Twice a week for 8 weeks (1 weekday and 1 weekend). There are tests on the 8th and 16th sessions. The second phase is conducted over 4 weeks. Thrice a week for 4 weeks (2 weekdays and 1 weekend).

RT is now legally like ICT; your employer is required to release you for both under the Enlistment Act.<br><br>Administratively, your NS unit is responsible for your RT. It'll book a progam slot for you if you didn't book one yourself, &amp; will also access your application for deferment (medical chit, studies, etc.).<br><br>If you're subsequently granted leave of absence, you must still do make-up training for each session missed, subject to a maximum of 2-3 depending on which RT Phase you're in. Any further missed sessions would render your existing RT program void, you being called back for investigations (maybe with disciplinary actions), &amp; a new RT schedule rebooked for you.<br><br>http://content.miw.com.sg/Mindef/Static/Ippt1/FAQs/rt_faq_index.asp<br><br></div>
