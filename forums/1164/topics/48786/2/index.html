Its like going to tutorials in schools, the timetable takes care of the availability. Cost is lower, sending pilots there and taking care of their lodging is pennies compared to maintaining a fleet of aircraft. And there is no need for ground crew. FTS is going towards using civilian ground crews. With N FTC, rsaf don't have to deploy its own enginerring people. With several nations using the program the cost is spread among each other.  The training area is superb, its the size of france and germany which allows students to practise long range strike and nav.  Interaction with other NATO forces.... And we are already in the program, any decision will be based on current experience in NFTC.</div>

I personally thinks that operate single type of a/c is kinda risky as if 1 plane is to be grounded, the whole squadrons have to be grounded for checking.  Take the chinook as the example.  Even as we join the F-35 program, the export can only be started around 2010-12 onwards and the A-4SU replacement right now will also efects the F-5S/T replacement also.  Even that i personally think use the blk 60 as the stop-gap between these two era of a/c(A-4SU/F-5 and F-35) rather than replace the A-4SU.<br><br>I personaly wish other aircraft be chosen with the exception of F-15T which i think it has g tthe kick, but the airframe will be like A-4 that old if we operate(deja vu?).<br><br>thats my thinking anyway, fel free to comments...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
