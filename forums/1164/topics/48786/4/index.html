            <div class='col-md body'>RAF Receives First Typhoon<br>Date Added : Wednesday, July 02, 2003<br><br>The UK Ministry of Defence officially released the RAF designations for the Typhoon on June 30 (see Headline News, August p4). Two-seat trainer variants will be designated <strong>Typhoon T.1 or Typhoon T.1A</strong>, depending on the production batch of the aircraft, <strong>whilst single-seat aircraft </strong> will be designated <strong>Typhoon F.2</strong>. The release coincided with the formal acceptance of the first RAF Typhoon T.1 aircraft, ZJ803/'AA' in full 17(R) Squadron markings, from BAE Systems at Warton, Lancashire on June 30. Billed as a 'giant step forward', in reality the event marked the successful completion of the Typhoon's type acceptance process. Type acceptance was a contractual process undertaken by all four nations to ensure the Typhoon met all agreed standards. The next stage of Typhoon's protracted evolution will be actual entry into service with the RAF, some five years after its original planned in-service date of 1998. The RAF has already begun ground school training at Warton with BAE Systems under the Contractor Support Services programme, known as Case White. Flight training will commence within the next three months. BAE SYSTEMS Chairman Sir Richard Evans described Typhoon as an Â“awesome aircraftÂ” and pledged that the Typhoon team would "ultimately prove this aircraft to be the world-beater we have promised.....Â” An international type acceptance ceremony was held at Eurofighter GmbH's Manching plant in Germany, attended by the defence minister of the Federal Republic of Germany and the deputy defence ministers from Great Britain, Italy and Spain. The agreements that have now been signed by respective governments allow for the official start of Typhoon deliveries to the RAF, German, Italian and Spanish Air Forces. In 2003 BAE Systems at Warton plans to deliver eleven Typhoon T.1s to the RAF, for use by 17(R) Squadron at BAE Warton. In Germany EADS Military Aircraft at Manching, will deliver eight to the German Air Force for use by Fighter Wing 73 (Jg-73) 'Steinhoff' at Laage AB. The Spanish Air Force will receive four Typhoons from EADS-CASA at Getafe, the aircraft will be used by Ala 11 at Moron AB.<br></div>

It is a derivative of the current F110-GE-129, which is in the 29,000-pound thrust class.<br><br>Flight testing was accomplished on a modified USAF F-16C at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Thirteen flights were conducted from April 25 through June 19. The original plan called for 25 flights over a three-month period, but aerial refueling and excellent engine performance and reliability allowed the number of flights to be cut in nearly half.<br><br>"The engine met or exceeded all of our expectations during extensive ground and flight testing,Â” said Dan Levin, Lockheed Martin project test pilot. Â“The engine performed flawlessly, even at extremes of the F-16 flight envelope, and you really notice the added thrust. The handling qualities in formation and aerial refueling were excellent. We look forward to testing the engine in the first Block 60 aircraft at Fort Worth later this year.Â”<br><br>The new engine version is being developed by General Electric Aircraft Engines, Evendale, Ohio, in support of a commercial contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., for the new Block 60 F-16.<br><br>Â“This is an important milestone in the Block 60 program leading to production of the first aircraft later this year,Â” said John L. Bean, vice president of F-16 programs. Â“This higher-thrust engine ensures the Block 60, which has the capability to operate at higher gross weights, will retain the F-16Â’s famous performance that entails acceleration, climb rate and sustained turn rate. New technologies are allowing this to be accomplished while maintaining or improving engine operability, durability, reliability or maintainability.Â”<br><br>The new engine version features Â“blisksÂ” (bladed-disks) in the three-stage modular fan section in lieu of traditional blades to improve performance and maintainability. The engine also incorporates an enhanced durability radial augmentor (afterburner) and exhaust nozzle, plus control software modifications to optimize engine performance at all flight conditions. The Block 60 aircraft and engine also will feature an auto-throttle capability.<br><br>Flight testing verified compatibility across the entire F-16 envelope, including high angle-of-attack and sideslip maneuvers, pushovers, inverted flight, and takeoff and landings. Test points included air starts, throttle transients, afterburner operation, primary and secondary fuel control operation, and formation flying.<br><br>The F-16 is the choice of 24 countries. More than 4,000 aircraft have been delivered, hundreds more are on order, and production is expected to continue beyond 2010. Major upgrades for all F-16 versions are being incorporated to keep the fleet modern and fully supportable over the aircraftÂ’s long service life.<br><br>Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., a business area of Lockheed Martin Corp., is a leader in the design, development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Typhoon boost for Europe<br><br>By Craig Hoyle, JDW Aviation Editor, Manching, Germany<br><br>Almost half a decade behind schedule, the Eurofighter Typhoon was finally accepted for operational service with the air forces of Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK on 30 June.<br><br>Officially marked during a type-acceptance ceremony at EADS' Manching facility in Germany, the development came as the partner nations, industry and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency also agreed to overhaul their current production and support processes for the project.<br><br>Under the terms of a newly concluded Tranche 2 framework agreement, the Eurofighter organisation will move away from its current consortium style to that of a prime contractor.<br><br>It is hoped that this will encourage much-needed process improvements ahead of future production agreements - the next of which is expected to be in place in the last quarter of this year.<br><br>However, UK Chief of Defence Procurement Sir Peter Spencer said steps will be taken "to move away from juste-retour" [division of workshare according to a partner nation's investment] in production of the Typhoon. "There is huge scope to make the Eurofighter programme leaner and more efficient," he said. Reducing the unit cost of the aircraft is another key objective of this process, said Spencer, noting that "[a saving of] between 10% and 20% should and must be achieved" over those aircraft now in production.<br><br>A total of 28 aircraft will be delivered to the partner air forces this year: eight to Germany; five to Italy; four to Spain; and 11 to the UK.<br><br><a href="http://www.janes.com/aerospace/military/news/jdw/jdw030707_1_n.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.janes.com/aerospace/military/news/jdw/jdw030707_1_n.shtml</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But the Russians aren't coming<br><br>It has cost Â£50 billion, has been 30 years in the making and is designed to fight an enemy that no longer exists. So is the Eurofighter a military white elephant? Andy Beckett investigates<br><br>Tuesday July 22, 2003<br>The Guardian<br><br>At the Royal International Air Tattoo on Saturday, there was a Eurofighter on display next to the runway of RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire. And next to the smooth, dark grey warplane, there was a young Eurofighter pilot called Gavin.<br>As people queued for a guided tour of the aircraft, in greater numbers than for any of the other exhibits, Gavin's job was to politely keep them in line and answer questions. At first glance, it looked quite a pleasant task: the sun was shining, the Eurofighter was gleaming, and the people queueing, who wore T-shirts with missiles on them and held carrier bags advertising the Daily Mail, did not seem likely opponents of the military-industrial complex.<br><br>Yet when they considered the Eurofighter they acquired a certain scepticism.<br><br>"Is it quick enough?" asked a man with a moustache and three grandchildren, typically, as he reached the head of the queue.<br><br>"It does Mach 2," said Gavin, patiently.<br><br>"Anything does Mach 2," said the man, loudly.<br><br>Gavin, who was wearing sunglasses, remained expressionless, but began to rock back and forth on his heels. The man continued: "The F-16 [an elderly American fighter] does Mach 2."<br><br>The sun, reflected off the runway, began to feel prickly rather than invigorating. Gavin reddened. Then he changed the subject to what "a fantastic aircraft" the Eurofighter was to fly. But the man seemed to have stopped listening.<br><br>This month, after more than a quarter of a century of development, and a decade later than planned, the RAF is finally receiving its first consignment of Eurofighters. "There is already a considerable buzz around frontline squadrons," the head of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire, crisply told the press three weeks ago. Jointly produced by Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy, the Eurofighter is the most expensive European defence project ever, with a big enough budget - more than Â£50bn for an anticipated 600 aircraft - to dig five Channel Tunnels.<br><br>Since the aircraft was conceived, it has survived countless technical and financial crises, design revisions and rescue packages, changes of government and shifts in strategic priorities. The resulting warplane, with its thick, slightly stubby fuselage and sharply swept-back wings, is "one of the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world", according to Stewart Penney, defence editor of the trade magazine Flight International.<br><br>But a feeling of unease lingers around the project. Partly this is down to the Eurofighter's problematic history; partly it is down to something more fundamental. As Penney admits: "The last time a UK pilot shot down an enemy aircraft was in 1982 in the Falklands." Since then, Britain's frequent wars have been fought against opponents either without air forces or without much chance to use them. Yet the Eurofighter was devised in a very different era: when massed formations of Russian aircraft were anticipated by western military planners as an accompaniment to an invasion of Europe.<br><br>With this threat, real or otherwise, having long receded, the Eurofighter's original role, using its manoeuvrability and clever weapons systems to perform Battle of Britain-style heroics, has been replaced by something more ambiguous. For critics of the international defence business and its political and military allies, the jet has become the perfect example of a well-connected industry's ability to make over-budget, redundant products and find a market for them regardless. "The Eurofighter is completely out of date," says Susan Willett, a defence analyst and "long-term sceptic" about the jet. "It's a cold-war beast."<br><br>For those suspicious of European collaborations in general, the fighter - paid for and built according to a complex and frequently disputed formula, which currently gives Britain the largest share, roughly a third, of the expenditure and the work - has become bloated with predictable compromises. Production contracts have been distributed according to political imperatives rather than ability of those chosen to fulfil them. Different wings of the same aircraft have been manufactured in different countries. The Eurofighter has become, literally, a warplane designed by committee.<br><br>But to supporters of the Eurofighter, all these complaints are either irrelevant or incorrect. "The aircraft is absolutely critical to the UK aerospace industry," says John Wall, the national aerospace secretary of the trade union Amicus. Estimates of the number of British jobs dependent on the project range from 10,000 to 80,000.<br><br>"These are worthwhile jobs," Penney adds. "Engineers, technicians, skilled artisans... often in places where there aren't many other jobs." Without this local expertise, he continues, Britain would have to buy fighters from America or even Russia, at probably greater cost.<br><br>In the beginning, it is generally forgotten now, the Eurofighter was meant to be practical and cheap. Since the end of the second world war, it had gradually, painfully become clear that creating a complex military aircraft was often too much for a medium-sized country. In Britain, a slender, futuristic fighter-bomber with a mixed performance record called the TSR2 was cancelled amid much national angst in 1965.<br><br>During the early 70s, that time of dawning financial realities for Britain and other European countries, a European Combat Aircraft, as the Eurofighter was initially known, was envisaged. By the following decade, Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy were working together. The need for the aircraft seemed obvious: in public at least, there seemed no end in sight to the cold war, and there were anxieties about a new generation of startlingly nimble Russian fighters. In October 1985, British Aerospace (now BAE Systems), the main British contractor, wheeled out a prototype Eurofighter at its long-established aircraft factory in Warton, Lancashire, to show the press. The aircraft looked sleek and modern and convincing. It was anticipated that it would enter service by the mid-90s at the latest.<br><br>But problems had already begun to surface. By 1985, France had decided that it wanted a jet primarily for attacking targets on the ground rather than other aircraft. The other countries wanted the opposite. That summer, France pulled out of the project and began developing its own rival plane, the Rafale.<br><br>In Britain, by the late 80s, there were political doubts "about the wisdom of so large a [Eurofighter] programme", the defence minister Alan Clark recorded in his diaries. "I am inclined... to maintain design and research teams. But defer going into production for as long as one can. The moment something goes into production it is obsolescent and all the in-service problems start crowding in."<br><br>Before this could happen, the Berlin Wall fell. In Germany in particular, deterring the Russians abruptly became less of a priority. By 1992, the cost of reunification had made German withdrawal from the European Fighter Aircraft scheme, as it was now called, an apparent certainty. "The European Fighter Aircraft is as good as dead," concluded Alastair Campbell, then the Daily Mirror's political editor.<br><br>However, he and other commentators had underestimated the political leverage of the defence industry. In newspapers across the political spectrum, sympathetic stories began to appear about the plight of aerospace workers if the Eurofighter was cancelled. There was a demonstration in London, with even the Socialist Workers Party providing placards ("No Closures. No Job Losses. Stuff The Tories.") In Britain, the German defence minister, who had suggested that "the plane has to adjust to the security situation and not the other way round", was portrayed as a dangerous heretic.<br><br>In the end, Germany stayed faithful to the project. A recession was chilling Europe's economies, and Germany needed workable relations with Britain to further its hopes for European integration. Yet the Eurofighter scheme continued to be a struggle. Sharing the work between four countries increased, rather than reduced, costs. Satisfying four separate air forces demanded compromises - the jet got heavier - and the production of four different versions of the same aircraft. Even the name became a problem: in 1998 a British plan to change it yet again to the Typhoon reportedly caused friction with the Germans, who vividly remembered an RAF ground-attack aircraft of the same name incinerating German tank crews during the second world war.<br><br>At air shows during the 90s, the Eurofighter became notorious for its non-appearances and technical glitches. Last November, just as it finally seemed about to enter service, a prototype crashed in Spain after its engines stopped. At the vast, humming BAE Systems compound in Warton, workers developed ever more tactful ways of summarising the delays to inquiring journalists. As Andy Wishart, a senior engineer and Eurofighter veteran, put it last week: "The waters have never been smooth, shall we say." Almost in passing, he mentions that there are still "minor technical problems".<br><br>Yet what strikes the visitor to Warton most is not frustration but confidence. The factory looms over its surrounding village, disproportionately large, like questions of defence policy in the minds of most British politicians. BAE workers stroll round the village with their name tags proudly showing. In the nearest pub to the factory, the woman behind the bar says, "There's a saying round here. British Aerospace will always be there."<br><br>As Professor Malcolm Chalmers, a defence economist at Bradford University, points out, "The average voter has much less connection with what works or not in defence than in schools or hospitals." At the same time, British military projects can draw on centuries of national pride about British prowess and ingenuity with weapons. At Saturday's air tattoo, a Eurofighter was self-consciously scheduled to appear in the flying display immediately after a Spitfire.<br><br>When its time came, the Eurofighter roared on a distant runway, shot briefly forward, and took off at an improbable angle, climbing almost vertically towards the gathering clouds. Then it slowed, and began to swing back and forth across the sky with a strange, asymmetrical twisting motion, like a dead leaf spinning on a gust of wind, except perfectly under control. For a few minutes, it became more possible to understand what had driven the Eurofighter advocates on.<br><br>But at the railway station afterwards, there was a reminder that time might finally be running out for them. The stationmaster had struck up a conversation with a family who had been at the tattoo. There was one thing he wanted to know. Had they seen the American stealth fighter?<br><br><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0,11816,1003333,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/military/story/0,11816,1003333,00.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Korean F-15Ks Specialized for Air, Sea and Ground Combat<br>By David A. Fulghum<br>August 10, 2003<br><br>Boeing's ROK Star<br><br>Boeing is nearing completion of its design for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Air Force's F-15K, as part of a $4.2-billion deal that will provide Seoul with the 40 most modern F-15s in the world--specialized for air-to-air combat as well as ground attack and maritime strike.<br><br>They will be the first F-15s with 15 smart weapons stations--six more than current operational F-15Es--that could arm the aircraft with 15,500-lb. joint direct attack munition bombs, if desired, said Steve Winkler, Boeing's director of F-15 production programs. Smart weapons stations allow updated target information to be transferred into weapons up to the point of launch for greater accuracy. First flight is slated for March 2005 with delivery of two aircraft to South Korea to follow in November 2005.<br><br>A $3.6-billion direct commercial sale buys the aircraft from Boeing, according to company documents. A $300-million foreign military sale provides F-15E training from the U.S. Air Force, cryptographic equipment and AIM-120 medium-range missiles. The U.S. Navy is to supply AGM-84 Harpoon, Slam-ER and AIM-9X missiles. A second $300-million contract with Samsung TechWin covers the General Electric F110-129 engines. It is the first time production F-15s have come equipped with GE engines.<br><br>The F-15Ks will be multi-role fighters and strike aircraft, the latest in the lineage that includes the U.S. Air Force's F-15E, the Royal Saudi Air Force's F15S and the Israel Air Force's F-15I. USAF will provide F-15E training to the Korean aircrews, and Boeing will subsequently provide additional training on the F-15K's maritime systems and the latest modifications. Many of the modifications are on the U.S. fighter road map to be added at a later date.<br><br>Another wrinkle, in addition to the maritime package, is the decision to equip the F-15Ks with the General Electric F110-129 engines, said other aerospace industry officials. Korea had equipped its F-16 frontline combat aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines. But with the worry that a systemic engine problem could ground the whole fleet, planners decided to diversify their engine suppliers.<br><br>Boeing is currently completing the aircraft's subsystem designs. These include major pieces of avionics including upgraded jammers, radar warning receivers and chaff/flare dispensers.<br><br>The Koreans have ordered a software development test facility so they can develop their own upgrades for the aircraft's advanced core processor and programmable armaments control set, Winkler said. While the U.S. doesn't turn over source codes for the radar and electronic warfare equipment, Korea has ordered an electronic warfare programming station that allows Korean specialists to modify the threats, techniques and parameters, he said.<br><br>THE AIRCRAFT will come with the APG63(V)1 radar (air-to-ground and air-to-sea search and track modes added) using a mechanically scanned antenna, Winkler said. Again there is the option to later upgrade to an active electronically scanned array. AESA radars are more powerful and multifunctional, according to other aerospace officials. While many aspects are classified, it offers longer range and better discrimination of small, stealthy targets like cruise missiles even in ground clutter. It also can simultaneously be used to jam enemy electronics, they said. The F-15's large radar housing allows installation of an antenna with thousands of elements which makes the system virtually maintenance free and extremely reliable.<br><br>An infrared search and track system (IRST) allows the aircraft to operate in an electronically passive mode to avoid revealing its position or identity. The system also offers a multi-spectral view of the battlefield and environment for better situational awareness. There is also a third-generation targeting and navigation pod, as well as a night-vision-compatible cockpit.<br><br>Along with its expansive range of weapons and sensors, the F-15K will carry real-time communications data links for establishing a targeting network with airborne early warning and control aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft. These capabilities look ahead to Korea's E-X program.<br><br>"It appears that the South Korean Air Force is heading in the direction of establishing a network," Winkler said. "They wanted Link 16 [data links] on their F-15Ks. It makes a lot of sense for a command and control network."<br><br>In meeting Korea's special needs, the new aircraft will carry: a single box Identification Friend or Foe system that includes interrogator, transponder and cryptographic function; ARC-232 combination UHF/VHF radio; dual embedded GPS/INS navigation systems; Advanced Display Core Processor and 6-in. LCDS displays; a new Tacan; Link 16 fighter data link (for network-centric operations) and a joint helmet-mounted cuing system that in combination with the AIM-9X will give an improved air-to-air as well as ground and maritime strike capabilities.<br><br><a href="http://aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_awst_story.jsp?id=news/081103news.xml" rel="nofollow">http://aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_awst_story.jsp?id=news/081103news.xml</a></div>
