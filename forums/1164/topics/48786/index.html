Assuming that the DSTA's list wins the stamp of approval from the government, this would mean that Boeing's F/A-18E/F, the Dassault Rafale and the Sukhoi Su-35 have been dropped from consideration.<br><br>Here may yet be a twist, however, as a revised Rafale bid from Dassault is reportedly still under review. The modified proposal was submitted after the March deadline had come and gone and this has resulted in the final selection being pushed out to either late July or possibly into the beginning of August. In its revised bid, Dassault has proposed that Singapore collaborate and provide some funding for development of an upgraded Rafale variant. This may be the previously mooted Rafale Mk2 for which Dassault is seeking a launch customer. Intended strictly for the international market, the Mk2 would be fitted with the uprated Snecma M88-3 engines, conformal fuel tanks permitting a 10-15-percent increase in range, and a new active, electronically-scanned radar system. Should Singapore go with Dassault, that country's industry would participate in the aircraft's development and could take part in its marketing.<br><br>Singapore currently operates a mix of Lockheed Martin F-16 and locally-upgraded Northrop F-5 fighter aircraft. It also has a large inventory of McDonnell Douglas-built A-4 types which serve in the attack and training roles.<br><br>From Forecast International.......<br></div>

I think Rafale is almost doomed to fail commercially unless Dassault can suddenly secure a few orders from India, Taiwan, or some European countries.<br><br>Singapore would benefit technologically, call it paying for technology transfer, tutition, or what ever you like, the benefit is more likely going to happen in ST Aero and DSTA being involved in some of the most advanced development of radar technology, plus some other avionics type exercises.  The total cost might just push the cost per frame a fair bit higher. If the cost per aircraft can be lower than that of the F-15E, then Rafale will have a chance, if not, I think we are going to see Block 60 Vipers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why be surprised at Blk 60 Vipers being part of the contenders? In fact, not only are is it a  contender, but according to Asian Military Review, its a very strong contender too. However, in AMR, the F-16 was referred to as a F-16 Blk 59 (?!), and it was explained that the F-16 offered would be a hybrid of the Blk 60 of the UAE, the Blk 52+ of Greece and the F-16I of the IAF. I won't be very surprised at all if we happen to choose the F-16.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Much as I like the Rafale I'd have the agree with Joe Black that the Rafales future is looking bleak at the moment. The weak market combined with a geopolitical shift of late has made it look very unlikely that the Rafale would be chosen.<br><br>As for the joint venture development, again Joe Black has got it spot on. For while we will get a share of the profits from the Rafales export success should we sign on, the question would be how much of a success would the Rafale be export-wise. Because if it is not, a share of the profits would become a share of the loss.<br><br>While we will stand to gain in terms of tech-transfer and knowledge etc, would this offset the monetary losses should Rafale fail in the transfer market?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YourFather,<br><br>the F-16I is a Block 52+ equivalent, so are the Greeks recent deliveries as well as the 20 on order currently for the RSAF. All the aircraft, while differing in small detail, still come under the designation Block 52+ because of similarities in the majority of their on board systems, capabilities and structures.<br><br>The UAE are of course Block 60s, which are quite a different beast to the 52+.<br><br>Me thinks the newest Vipers on offer are Block 60 (or would the PW engined version be called 62?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me its simple.  If the airframe works, is of a good design, can pull g's without breaking apart, I am happy with it.  How Hi-tech can air-frame design be?  Forward canard? Does the typhoon/rafale air-frame really improve the performance of a jet?  Even if it does, is it considered a new capability?<br><br>Weighing it out, if the F-16 Block 60, or F-15T is gonna give us new capabilities, screw the airframe and take the capability.<br><br>Eg.  Will you take a state of the art supermaneuverable airframe or ECM that will fry every radar in a 40km radius?<br><br>Consider this.   Will your supermaneuverable fighter, such as typhoon, rafale, su-35 retain that ability while ladened with external fuel tanks, HARMs, Cluster bombs and AAMs?  If these planes will come with new capabilities, eg.  New jamming systems, countermeasures and TEWS, by all means take it.<br><br>Otherwise, if the F-15T/ F-16(60) is gonna promise us new capabilities and technology, take it.  These airframes are combat proven anyway, and everybody knows what they have done.<br><br>Btw, I have heard of and F-15E, land with 1 wing missing.</div>

However, the Strike Eagle version is actually designed in the mid 80s as the Aardvark's replacement.<br><br>The Israeli in early 90 opted a modified version called the F-15I with lots of indigenious stuff. The Israeli, after a long study of F-16ES and the Bugs determined that F-15i could do many things the other wouldn't be able to do, especially, carry long distant deep strike penetration into Iraq to hunt for scud launchers. The other two would be able to reach there and back, but no fuel to loiter around for long.<br><br>I believe the F15 version that will be offered to RSAF will have an AESA radar too. It most likely going to include all the sweeten stuffs like what the RKoAF is getting including JDAMs, Slammer-ER???, etc.<br><br>My personal belief is that RSAF will most likely end up with the upgrade Viper, a Block 59 or a Block 60, with the AESA radar, and a couple of add-ons such as the Sniper-XR pod, etc.<br><br>Man, I would have love to see Rafale though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally think that a single seat plane with win the competition. F-15 does not stand much of a chance not because it is an old design but because it is a 2 seater. With the intention to replace the A-4s and some F-5s, we might be talking about a total of around 60-70 planes being purchase in the long run. that mean that we need to find at least 60 more WSOs...unfortunately we do not enjoy the luxury of having a large manpower base.....RSAF really have to scrap the bottom of the manpower barrel if they really decides on F-15s......<br><br>I am not surprised at the delay at all...... it is pretty obvious that they are waiting for the 4-nations acceptance of the eurofighter later this month then they will make a decision.....In fact they are supposed to announce the shortlist since 2nd quarter last year but due to the nigging problems in the eurofighter we too have to delay the announcement..... so my guess is in the typhoon...<br><br>my hunch is that RSAF will buy the europroblem..... opps i mean eurofighter.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, here's my two cents worth of opinion lah... i think singapore should not buy any planes now... due to the economic situation in the region... though i know it's a bit funny lah, but think of it, we save our economy now, we earn more money... by the time the JSF comes out, we'll have more money to buy more... and since we're making a bulk purchase, i'm sure LM will throw in more goodies as an inncentive or something lah... besides, the time isn't right to by military hardware now... with mahatir stepping down soon, our northern neighbours might misunderstand our intentions... anyways, our airforce isn't really in need of these hardware for now, we can make do with what we have for at least another 5yrs...<br><br>this is only my opinion lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
