Also the ground is not soft soil buy small stones . Unless he use a 0.5 instead of 7.62. then his position will be disclose.<br><br>If another sniper is around, he will be using bino to check all holes, if you wet the soil or do too much preparation, he may notice it.</div>

I don't think SAF designates and trains their snipers for urban and jungle, but I could be wrong, at least in my unit they didn't.</div>
