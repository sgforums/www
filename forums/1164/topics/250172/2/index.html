            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>PHALCON stands for Â“PHased-Array L-band CONformal radarÂ”, it should apply 4 L-band AESA arrays at planeÂ’s both sides of the fuselage as well as nose &amp; rear to porvide ful 360 deg coverage. However, the G550 AEWs being acquired by RSAF only found side L-band AESA radar and the front &amp; rear L-band radar arrays were replaced by a more economic S-band radar, is the S-band radar still AESA? I doubt, if itÂ’s AESA, S-band radar usually has a longer search range than L-band one provided the power output is on par. If the S-band radar got a short range than the L-band one, it could emit much less power than the L-band one, a non AESA radar usually emits much less power than AESA radar.<br><br>So the G550 doesnÂ’t exactly use a Phalcon but an cost effective version of it.<br></blockquote>In the first place the term Phalcon does not mean 4 L-band radar arrays. Secondly, the G550 plane carries a system of arrays(which includes the two phalcon arrays)to achieve the desired result.  You find the same system on the Chilean Phalcon AWACs and the Israeli Eitam. It is not a cost effective version of the real thing. It is the real deal. This is the AEW system offered by Israel and offered to Singapore, South Korea and Australia. Go figure. It is very much sought after. The chinese went to great lengths to try to get it. The Koreans almost did it but could not get the right approvals on time from the US.<br><br></div>

While these four architectures are currently pre-eminent, readers should also note that India has restarted its indigenous AEW &amp; C programme and is developing an indigenous ESA radar which, in the first instance, will be applied to an ERJ-145 platform.<br></blockquote>This is what you quoted. No where it is mentioned that 4 similar arrays are mandated from the term `Phalcon' itself. Obviously there will be variants of the system given the expanse of time. The G550 carries a more advanced version of the original Phalcon based system albiet in a tighter outfit.<br><br>http://www.defense-update.com/products/n/nachshon.htm<br><br>Im interested to know where you got the information that the A50I carries 4 similar arrays.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some of what I have read is not available online. For example, some IP protected IEEE paper. The online info usually is lack of detail, actually from what I have read, all arrays working in the same bandwidth &amp; waveform got certain advantages. Because the front array and side array have overlay azimuth coverage, the overlay area actually provides better resolution &amp; range &amp; more detailed information of target, Phalcon aka Elta El/2075 has exactly some modes to exploit these features.  IÂ’m not  sure how they are going to compensate feature change because of replacing the L-band array with an S-band one.<br><br>HereÂ’s read for Phalcon, not exactly what you required, but at least you can see Phalcon standard config is with 4 arrays, and as the name suggested, it must in L-band, or it will be called PHA-L-S-CON<br><br><a href="http://www.aewa.org/Library/condor-info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aewa.org/Library/condor-info.html</a><br><br><blockquote> No conventional rotodome. The radar systems (up to four) are locate in varying combinations of a bolbous nose extension, two large cheek extensions, one on either side of the fuselage and at the tail under the rear fuselage. The Chilian Condor is only configured with the nose and two cheek systems.</blockquote>And another one:<br><a href="http://www.spyflight.co.uk/phalcon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spyflight.co.uk/phalcon.htm</a><br><br><blockquote> It is understood that IAI are also developing a miniaturised version of the Phalcon system for installation on the 3 Gulfstream G550 intelligence gathering platforms ordered for the IAF.

Eliezer Shkedy. The plane will join the Nahshon Squadron, which also operates intelligence-gathering planes called Shavit (Comet).<br><br>"The arrival of this AWACS enhances our long-range capabilities," Deputy Squadron Commander Maj. I. told The Jerusalem Post, "It extends our range of sight and our operational capabilities."<br><br>The AWACS plane that arrived on Tuesday is the first of three Gulfstream G-550 jets to be delivered to the IAF over the next three years. The plane, usually built as a top-tier business jet and purchased from the US-based General Dynamics, was built according to IAF specifications and outfitted with more than $100 million worth of radar and command-and-control systems. The equipment was developed by Elta Systems, a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries.<br><br>The plane is capable of flying at 35,000 feet and has a range of 10,000 km. Equipped with radar systems capable of creating a 360 degree aerial picture over enemy countries during combat, the Eitam could also replace, Maj. I. said, ground-based command-and-control stations if they were destroyed by enemy action.<br><br>Israel has not had an airborne radar capability since 1994, when the IAF took a squadron of older-model AWACS, called the Hadiya, out of service. The new arrival, Maj. I. said, was a big step forward for the IAF as the plane was "relevant to all of the current threats against Israel."<br><br>Speaking at the ceremony, Shkedy said the Eitam was an essential operational tool that would be utilized to create aerial pictures deep inside enemy territory while at the same time serving as a warning system for incoming aerial threats.<br><br>Hinting at a connection between the arrival of the new aircraft and Iran's race to obtain nuclear weapons, Shkedy said, "Throughout the years of Israel's existence, defense of the skies has been the IAF's primary mission. Over the years, however, the threats have changed... and the potential for an existential threat to the state is taking form while the bells of peace are still, to our misfortune, far away."<br><br>Nissim Hadas, CEO of Elta Systems, told the Post that the radar aboard the Eitam had a range of "several hundred kilometers." The plane, he said, was capable of carrying up to 20 passengers and was compact and fuel efficient.<br><br>"The plane doesn't need to enter enemy territory," Hadas said. "It can fly far away while creating and projecting the aerial picture above the country in which the IAF wants to operate."</blockquote><img src="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?blobcol=urlimage&amp;blobheader=image%2Fjpeg&amp;blobheadername1=Cache-Control&amp;blobheadervalue1=max-age%3D300&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=JPImage&amp;blobwhere=1157913665324&amp;cachecontrol=never&amp;ssbinary=true"><br>The first of three Airborne Warning and Control System<br>(AWACS)purchased by the IDF arrives to the Lod Air Force base,<br>Tuesday.<br>Photo: IDF<br><br>2.Boys,where is/are antennas?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to compare:<br><br><blockquote>Northrop Grumman:<br><br>The first Northrop Grumman E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, being built for the U.S. Navy by prime contractor Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), made its first public appearance at rollout ceremonies here today. The E-2D was designed in New York and built in St. Augustine...<br><br>The aircraft unveiled today is the first of two test aircraft to be built under the nearly $2 billion system demonstration and development contract awarded in 2001 to Northrop Grumman. According to Mahr, the Navy plans to procure a total of 75 Advanced Hawkeye aircraft.<br><br>While the external appearance is similar to the E-2C, the systems and capabilities which the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye contains are completely redesigned. At the heart of the aircraft is the new radar, the APY-9, designed and built by Lockheed Martin Corporation. It can "see" smaller targets and more of them at greater ranges than the E-2C. The new rotodome, developed by L-3 Communications Randtron Antenna Systems, contains the critically important, continuous, 360-degree scanning capability, while adding an electronically scanned array. This system allows operators to focus the radar on selected areas of interest.<br><br>Hawkeye operators will have new radar system workstations, integrated satellite communications capabilities and other tools to better manage the battle space and provide warfighters with expanded situational awareness and information to complete their missions.<br><br>An additional new feature of the E-2D is the state-of-the-art glass cockpit that replaces prior-generation Hawkeye displays and avionics systems. One of the advantages is that pilots can also serve as weapon system operators.<br><br></blockquote><img src="http://www.murdoconline.net/2007/e-2d_hawkeye-thumb.jpg"><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.murdoconline.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.murdoconline.net/ 30.04.2007</a></strong><br><br></div>
