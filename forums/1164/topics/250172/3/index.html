Of course you need add in powerful signal processing behind the phase arrayed antenna to support LPI.<br><br>Multiple agile beams in a split of second is what AESA can fool the ARMÂ’s seeker.<br><br>Signals from AESAÂ’s sidelobe is very low and active cancelling techniques make the ARM impossible to lock on the AESAÂ’s sidelobe.<br><br>So the Seeker of ARM has to look for the AESAÂ’s main beam, but unfortunately, the ARM seekers require a certain dwell time in order to get a lock, for example, the seeker of ARM needs certain time to continually receive the stable beam emitted from the target in order to build a moving targetÂ’s flight profile so that it can home on afterwards. The electronic steered beams can come &amp; go so fast that they won't even provide the dwell time for the ARM to lock, besides LPI, frequency hopping and pulse compression all come into play.<br><br>Another point, as previously some numbers have said, the G550 has a much faster cruise speed over old E-2C platform, AESA allows a faster carrier plane. The faster speed is not to say you are going to outrun of a Mach 4 missile but itÂ’s because the moving target always makes the attacking missiles difficult to lock, the faster, the harder. To certain speed, it may be out of ARMÂ’s allowed limit to engage a moving target.<br></div>

On the other hand..hmmm...wonder if this is secret stuff. AFAIK roll royce didnt have another  sale on press release either... so it's likely speculation??<br><br>Alternatively someone remember in around 2008-09 to visually peek at the gulfstream when they arrice to see if there's any with the box pointing downwards. That would kinda be a dead giveaway.</div>

Not too sure if they`re the ones we bought or it is meant for testing.<br><br>The GS Phalcons are meant to replace the E-2Cs. Confirmed lah. My friend who is a techy guy inside told me. At any rate, it is official that we bought the platform; i.e CAEW(from the horse`s mouth; the SAF and the company which makes the plane)So, what else can it be used for? And the E-2Cs are going to be retired.  You cannot hide equipment that big which is why the SAF has to come out into the open. You can see our E-2Cs flying over our air-space too. How to hide?  Also, i reckon it serves a detterant effect.<br><br>The E-2Cs will of course be flying till the GS are ready. So, technically, it can be said we are not using the GS yet.<br><br></div>
