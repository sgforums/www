Because we are a small country, our ability to see potential threats early is critical to our defence. One new sensor that the RSAF will operate is Gulfstream 550 - Airborne Early Warning system.<br><br>Based on a business jet, the Gulfstream 550 (G550-AEW) aircraft will replace the E-2Cs that have served the RSAF well for the last 20 years. Equipped with a better radar and modern information systems, the Gulfstream 550 will significantly enhance the RSAF's airborne early warning and surveillance capability.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm no expert on air defence so bare with me while I ponder some things:<br><br>1.  If I'm not wrong, none of our neighbours have AWACS.  We're the first &amp; I think the only.  Now we've even replaced the E2C with a better AWACS.  So how come despite their increased funding &amp; shopping of subs, attack choppers, jets, MBTs, et al, they've not even bought a single AWACS?  They feel its not vital?  Or maybe they already have them but are pretending not to?<br><br>2.  Ever since we phased out the Bloodhounds, we've not had any long range missiles.  And there doesn't appear to be any plans to get those.  How come?  Does RSAF figure medium range missiles like the I-Hawk (which are getting old too I may add) are enough?  I doubt its for fear of making our neighbours pee in their pants 'cos we did have long range SAMs before anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good questions sgf, but I doubt none of us here can really answer them.<br><br>1.  Its really up to the countries you decide to answer these questions.  They decide their policies and postures, not us.  In anycase, AWACS platforms have proven themselves to be vital in controlling airspace and maintaining air superiority. They are indeed huge force multipliers.<br><br>2.  We don't really know what RSAF possesses. Perhaps they did acquire S-300s from the Ruskies, or even the Spyder/Derby from the Mexicans.  No one knows, and no one is willing to confirm. Still, even with what is known, the RSAF still possesses one of the best and lethal IADS in this part of the world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those who are interesting to have some more background information on world AWACS/AEWs landscape, I quote here some reference materials from JaneÂ’s:<br><br><blockquote> As this edition of Jane's Radar and Electronic Warfare Systems went to press, the global Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW &amp; C) market was effectively dominated by four architectures: Ericsson Microwave's Erieye surveillance radar mounted on either an Embraer ERJ-145 or Saab 340/2000 airframe, Lockheed Martin's AN/APS-145 radar installed (predominantly) aboard Northrop Grumman's Hawkeye platform, Northrop Grumman's Multirole Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) sensor mounted on a Boeing 737 airframe and Elta System's Phalcon AEW &amp; C suite installed aboard either a Beriev A-50/Ilyushin Il-76 or Gulfstream G500 series airframe. Of these, Erieye-based systems are in service with the air forces of Brazil, Greece, Mexico and Sweden and are being bid to South Korea and Pakistan (Saab 2000 aircraft), while Northrop Grumman continues to produce E-2C Hawkeye 2000 aircraft for the US Navy and is gearing up to produce the next generation E-2D platform which features a new ESA/mechanical scanning radar that is being developed by Lockheed Martin. For its part, the Boeing 737/MESA combination has been ordered by Australia and Turkey and is a strong contender to meet South Korea's long standing E-X AEW &amp; C requirement. Variants of Elta's Phalcon suite are mandated for an Indian Il-76 application and Israel's Gulfstream G500 series compact AEW platform, with the latter application forming the basis of a South Korean E-X bid. While these four architectures are currently pre-eminent, readers should also note that India has restarted its indigenous AEW &amp; C programme and is developing an indigenous ESA radar which, in the first instance, will be applied to an ERJ-145 platform.<br><br>Elsewhere, China has embarked on a two-pronged national AEW &amp; C effort that centres around AEW &amp; C variants of the Y-8 and Il-76 transport aircraft. Here, the Y-8 application makes use of what is believed to be an AESA radar that features a 'plank' antenna not dissimilar to that used with the Erieye sensor, while the Il-76 platform is equipped with a fixed, dorsal 'rotodome' that is suggestive of an ESA/AESA radar that makes use of three fixed transceiver arrays arranged in a triangular configuration to provide 360Âº coverage in azimuth. Looking to the future, it is Jane's Radar and Electronic Warfare Systems' opinion that the AEW &amp; C market remains buoyant, with (alongside the already noted examples) procurements possible in Chile, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore (possible Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) solution - JREW believes such a capability will be demonstrated within the next decade), Spain, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. Readers should also remember the potential of helicopters in the AEW &amp; C role, a viewpoint exemplified by India's procurement of the Ka-31/E-801 radar combination and the UK's use of the Sea King/Searchwater 2000AEW system.</blockquote></div>

However, the G550 AEWs being acquired by RSAF  only found side L-band AESA radar and the front &amp; rear L-band radar arrays were replaced by a more economic S-band radar, is the S-band radar still AESA? I doubt, if itÂ’s AESA, S-band radar usually has a longer search range than L-band one provided the power output is on par. If the S-band radar got a short range than the L-band one, it could emit much less power than the L-band one, a non AESA radar usually emits much less power than AESA radar.<br><br>So the G550 doesnÂ’t exactly use a Phalcon but an cost effective version of it.<br></div>
