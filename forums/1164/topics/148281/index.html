Actually the name "Perisher" is a short form of the name for the course.<br>It's actually called the "Periscope Course".  Guess that comes from the fact that the trainee will be "hugging" the periscope most of the time on the course..<br>Interestingly, the RN has a history of sending their Perisher graduates back to submarines as First Lieutenants (or also known as XO). There are after all more Perishers than submarines avaliable. This means that there are often <span style="font-style: italic;">two</span> command qualified men onboard.<br>And also, the RN likes to send submarine COs to command ASW frigates after their tour as submarine COs. It takes a real submariner to catch a submarine.</div>
