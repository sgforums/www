That's where we get $$ to buy these fancy military gadgets and 5 dollar meals...<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>We are not suited to command (or did not want to).

This is blind faith...I think the better way to put it is that the majority of us have clearer heads than the people in MINDEF, so that's why we didn't stick around. Unless of cos', you are making a conscious decision to stay on due to personal choices...<br><br><blockquote><strong> If they believe that the SPH and upcoming projects are enough, it's enough.<br><br>We're not on any commitee that decides what is right for the SAF.<br><br>What we believe is right for the SAF, is not what they believe.

But we have to voice our opinions, ideas, and thoughts.

            <div class='col-md body'>Clear heads in Mindef command? I'm not too sure about that but there are plenty of issues in the SAF that could easily be improved with little, or even saving cost but remain undone thanks to their "clear" heads and tons of red tape.<br><br>If anything, many of these "clear" heads seem fustratingly detached, rigid, and more interested in keeping things the way they are and setting up wayang shows, completely lost from the realities of keeping the front line operationally optimal to really know what is going on, and what's really needed.</div>
