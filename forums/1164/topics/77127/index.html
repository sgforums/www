            <div class='col-md body'>First Fuel Cell Submarine for Export Launched at HDW<br><br>(Source: HDW; issued Apr. 22, 2004)<br><br>Under the name Papanikolis, today Evangelia Vassiliki launched the first fuel cell submarine for export from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) in Kiel.<br><br>The submarine, with the construction number 361, is a 214 Class submarine and has been built for the Greek Navy.<br><br>The HDW group is building a total of four of these submarines for the Greek Navy. Of these, the first vessel is being built in Kiel and the subsequent vessels will be built at the HDW subsidiary company Hellenic Shipyards in Greece. The submarines are scheduled for delivery between 2005 and 2010.<br><br>The 214 Class of submarines is based on the successful construction principles of the 209 Class submarine, of which HDW have built more than 60 since 1960. It was improved by incorporating the innovations of the 212A Class submarine, principally the unique air-independent fuel cell propulsion system. This provides extremely increased underwater endurance. The minimized acoustic, thermal and magnetic signatures of the submarine provide an unbeatable degree of undetectability. Increased diving depth and overall efficiency provide new operational advantages.<br><br>The vessel, with a displacement of 1,700 tons, is 65 meters long and is manned by a crew of 27. The propulsion is provided by a Siemens Permasyn engine which draws its power supply either from the fuel cells or from batteries which are fed by a diesel generator. Its armament consists of eight torpedo tubes. The vessel has an integrated sonar and weapons control system for navigation and for deployment in active military operations. The principal tasks of the vessel are reconnaissance, interception and surveillance. It is also capable of being deployed against surface vessels and submarines, for covert operations and for mine laying.<br><br>I vote for Gemany Type 214 and Sweden Viking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though the current second hand submarines purchased from Sweden is considered old, i don't think that the equipment within the hull is old as well. This is because the extensive works have been carried out on these submarines before they are handed over to the RSN. The official works are termed as tropicalisation, which means to make the subs suitable to the local warm tropical waters. I am quite sure that other upgrades are also involved. This is due to the trend that Singapore will almost always upgrade second- hand equipment from other countries. Examples are the M113,A-4 Skyhawk,AMX-13. Since it will be more convenient to train the naval personnel with the new equipment than with the old one at the country where upgrades are being carried out, therefore i believed that only the hulls of the subs are old not the internal components. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
