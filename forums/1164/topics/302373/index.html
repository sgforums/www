Or for sure?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CM06:<strong><br>OR it's too expensive to make every section carry 1* 6 shot heavy AGL.<br></strong></blockquote>I don't know about a 6-shot GL...<br><br>...but I don't think money is the problem why we don't issue SAR21 with GL. We like to mention money as a cause for problems we don't understand. Like I brought up the question of why the Ultimax drum was never issued for training and someone said "COST"!<br><br>I don't think it is cost, I think the SAR21 w/GL and the Ultimax drum not being issued for training means there might be techincal bugs with those systems.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CM06:<strong><br>M16/M203 still a good weapon what. If it's not THAT broken dont need to fixed it...yet.</strong></blockquote>Hehe, if by that token we don't need to replace the M16 either. Not broken wah...<br><br>Ever thought about the problem that the M16/M203 use a different magazine from the SAR21? That's a pretty serious problem don't you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the M16/M203 combo is there so that the SAW gunner has someone to kope magazines from when he runs out? And the Ultimax hasn't been replaced cuz the SAR-21 LMG has overheating problems. Not a very good reason I know but its the best I can think of.<br><br>Anyway, I would expect that the M16 will stick around for quite long. The whole army hasn't converted to SAR-21 yet, ditto for Navy and Airforce.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did my BMT at 3 BTS at Nee Soon.  Always kena arrow to help armskoteman.  Super confirm that the M16 were VERTICAL.  When I was posted to unit I didn't go armskote that often 'cos was downgraded to C2 but I do recall the M16s were also vertical 'cos I kena the stupid COC parade before ORD.<br><br>Anyway, talking about standardisation, if SAF really wants to standardise why are some units still using M16?  I'm no war strategist but this is a scenario from a non-combat serviceman's view.<br><br>Imagine war breaks out &amp; chaos rules.  You find yourself, a reservist armed with M16, running out of ammo or totally flat out.  You come across a dead friendly who has ammo BUT he's packing a SAR-21.  What are you gonna do?  Unload all his rounds from his SAR-21 mags &amp; reload into your M16 mags and pray no enemy finds you till you're done?  No point asking me to grab his SAR-21 'cos I don't know how to use the damn thing let alone clear an IA on it.<br><br>At least with the same rifle type, if I'm out of ammo and I come across a dead friendly, I can simply grab his mags and am ready to go.  Ok let's not talk about ethics and military law and what not lah.  When war breaks out and your life is at stake, screw everything.<br><br>I will NOT steal ammo from an injured friendly 'cos he still needs to defend himself but I have no qualms about stealing ammo and just about anything useful from a friendly who's as dead as a door knob.<br><br>The Belgian FN F2000 uses the same mag as M16.  Why couldn't they design the SAR-21 to at least use M16 mags too?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgf:</div><div class="quote_body">Did my BMT at 3 BTS at Nee Soon.  Always kena arrow to help armskoteman.  Super confirm that the M16 were VERTICAL.  When I was posted to unit I didn't go armskote that often 'cos was downgraded to C2 but I do recall the M16s were also vertical 'cos I kena the stupid COC parade before ORD.<br><br>Anyway, talking about standardisation, if SAF really wants to standardise why are some units still using M16?  I'm no war strategist but this is a scenario from a non-combat serviceman's view.<br><br>Imagine war breaks out &amp; chaos rules.  You find yourself, a reservist armed with M16, running out of ammo or totally flat out.  You come across a dead friendly who has ammo BUT he's packing a SAR-21.  What are you gonna do?  Unload all his rounds from his SAR-21 mags &amp; reload into your M16 mags and pray no enemy finds you till you're done?  No point asking me to grab his SAR-21 'cos I don't know how to use the damn thing let alone clear an IA on it.<br><br>At least with the same rifle type, if I'm out of ammo and I come across a dead friendly, I can simply grab his mags and am ready to go.  Ok let's not talk about ethics and military law and what not lah.  When war breaks out and your life is at stake, screw everything.<br><br>I will NOT steal ammo from an injured friendly 'cos he still needs to defend himself but I have no qualms about stealing ammo and just about anything useful from a friendly who's as dead as a door knob.<br><br>The Belgian FN F2000 uses the same mag as M16.  Why couldn't they design the SAR-21 to at least use M16 mags too? </div></blockquote>You can figure out pretty fast. Like firing a FiveseveN is no dfferent from firing the P226.</div>

Cos all the oil will flow into the backside.</blockquote>I was an armskote spec (sian job) in BMTC... weapons were stored vertically.<br><br>And of course when I was in unit they did the same as well, plus some horziontal mixed in... it depends on what kind of racks you happen to get I suppose...</div>
