            <div class='col-md body'>Magazines are NOT designed to be disposable. They are precision components of your weapon, and need to be cared for as much as the rest of the weapon. Throwing away magazines is something you only see in Hollywood.<br><br>First of all, do not slam the magazine into the magazine well. Just push it in until it locks. Repeated slamming of the magazine is the main reason for bent feed lips, which cause stoppages. This goes for the P226 service handgun as well. It is less garang, but it is the correct way.<br><br>Secondly, do not do anything which changes the seating of the magazine in the well. Do not rubber band the magazine to the weapon (or at least take the band off before you fire). Do not apply too much black tape to magazines. The seating of the magazine needs to be correct for the mechanism to cycle reliably, too far out or in and you will get stoppages.<br><br>Thirdly, report all bad magazines. Tell your armskoteman or superior if your magazine has obviously bent feed lips, dents or other damage. Also report if a magazine repeatedly experiences stoppages, while your other magazines don't. This will help identify bad mags for replacement early. Magazines in the SAF should be able to load and fire reliably all 30 rounds. Weak springs may cause the first few rounds to experience stoppages, and this should be reported -- such mags are not acceptable. If you are in the field, a field expedient in the event of weak magazine springs would be to load fewer rounds to ensure reliable feeding -- but this is only a field expedient and you should get the magazine replaced as soon as you can.<br><br>Lastly, care for your magazines. Keep them clean and mud free. Minimize damage to them. Don't use them as hammers to drive stakes into the ground. Don't dig with a magazine. Don't use them to prop up tables. I am sure there are even more horror stories of how mags are treated in the Army. Treat your magazines with respect.<br><br>In terms of combat reloading, just dump an empty magazine down your shirt or in a bag until you have a chance to return it to your webbing. I usually had one button undone on my shirt so I could easily put mags into my shirt. Don't be too stressed about how fast you reload. While seconds are jewels beyond price in combat, an extra second or so reloading is not a problem -- your section mates will cover you. It is more important to ensure that long delays don't occur due to mistakes -- like loading an empty instead of full magazine, or dropping a magazine, or fumbling to get the new magazine out. The key here is practice and drill. Choose a system you are comfortable with and practice till you do it automatically and correctly every time. Whether you release the magazine with the right or left hand, or how you hold the weapon while you reload is not so important -- at most it save you one or two seconds over another method. It is more important to do what you do reliably.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ermm Dkhoo... agree with most of what you're saying about the care of magazines, but i'm sure you will agree that 50% of SAF magazines out there are prob abt 10-15yrs old and does *not* get replaced cos of lack of funds.<br><br>Another thing, how did you dump the empty mags down your shirt without it falling out? I'm used to wearing my No.4 tucked <strong>out</strong> and seldom (never) wear any inner shirt inside.<br><br>edit: hrmmm now thinking abt it, i guess it would be possible seeing how the SBO would be fairly tight across the waist and stop it falling out. I normally just shove it into either hip pocket.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Uh, dhkhoo, the magazines were technically designed to be disposable - Colt's Robert Fremont filed patents for the metal magazine and a plastic version as well.  We just don't treat them that way in practice.  I'll admit that's splitting hairs, though.<br><br>Agreed on all your other points.  Then again, the first weapon that was issued to me, which wasn't replaced for eight months, was in such bad condition, the only way the magazine would stay in was if you slapped it - it was only my next weapon that actually appreciated my clicking the magazine in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
