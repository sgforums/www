It takes lots of practice to do it at nearly the same speed since the magazine catch is located at the back and not on the side like M16. Other than that, the procedure is the same as M16. One big problem about the SAR21 though is that it is not Left Handed friendly and too much components to look out for. Also now that is has no bayonet clip, really worry when it comes to close quaters combat.</div>

For your info, theres really no need to slap the charging handle/ cocking handle, to load the weapon.  Just release it from its catch/ housing/ whatever you want to name it, &amp; the charging bolt will slam home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually the logic behind not loading the entire mag fully with 30 rounds is that to reduce IA.When you load 30 rounds into a 30 round mag,chances are that that tension of the spring will not be strong enough to boost the rounds into the chamber to be fired.Thus,loading 28 is fine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Besides,few people actually load a round into the chamber and then remove the mag for put one more round in.</div></blockquote>Actually its not true.  There is nothing wrong with the spring of the m16/m4 mags.  The fault lies in the speed of the bolt carrier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Heehee....!  M16 was designed for the purpose of having a weapon with the option of firing at semi-auto &amp; single shot.  The problem is, the spring in the magazine is design to feed the rounds for firing auto mode.  So when you're firing 30 rounds on single mode, the spring in the mag is pushing the rounds upwards faster then the bolt can eject the empty cartridge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then again, nothing is perfect.  Just as long as you don't encounter a chamber explosion during firing, just go on shooting the way you do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
