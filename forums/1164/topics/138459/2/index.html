            <div class='col-md body'>SOPMOD is still in reality an M4 carbine with a flat top, Full auto lower, in M4 profile 1:7 twist barrel.  with the Knights industries RAS2 rails, forward grip, PAC4 laser and maybe a M68 Aimpint M2 scope or the ACOG TA-01NSN ..<br><br>THe basic problem of the M16 still exsisits which is fundamentally flawed.<br><br>Gas being blow back into the bolt carrier and creating that crystalized carbon in your bolt.  We do 5 days training in Gunsite AZ that goes thru 4000 rds in that duration both semi and Full auto ! We see a lot of jams ( IA drills) in the AZ desert.  with proper cleaning technique and maintainance this can be reduce but not eliminated.  I have personally seen SIG 550 series and Valemet , AK and FNC weapons that does the same drills with no jam !<br><br>Not putting down the M16 system ( I do love them and own a few of them ) but it has an inherit flaw in the system.<br><br>Also, the magazine system of the M16 is another problem!  You do not know "positively" if the mag is inserted properly espeically it is fully loaded.  even the you tap it when you insert the mag...Also! if fullu loaded mags !sometimes after prolong use, the spring tension and the shitty follower ( we had to change to a newer type follower, I hope SAF look into that! ) . Well! the new Heckler and Kock design M16 magazine helps in curing some of the problem! but it is the weak link of the M16.!<br><br>Yes! the US ARMY, spec ops love the system, like any other system, if you train the user properly, and they know how to handle it ! the system will work good.  However, if there is a better system and an improvement over it will help ease the inherit problem, than it may be a good idea to look into it.<br><br>IN fact Heckler and Koch recenlt release the HK M16 conversion that incorporate a piston ( like the AK, Steyr, SIG) system..... Hopfully this will be marketed soon! call the HK M416!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  can;t wait to get my hands on them!<br><br><a href="http://www.hkdefense.us/pages/military-le/rifles-carbines/hk416.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hkdefense.us/pages/military-le/rifles-carbines/hk416.html</a><br><br>DaveC!</div>

Hornady HPBT projectile with 21.2 gr. of milsurp WC844 powder, at an OAL of 2.255", for a mean velocity of about 2450 fps. It took quite a bit of experimenting to work up to this load, but it seems to be fairly accurate. This is typical of the groups I'm getting with this load at 100 yards:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Tgt_100yards_AR24.jpg"><br><br>And at 200 yards:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Tgt_200yards_AR24.jpg"><br><br>There is certainly still room for improvement, as we have several competitive AR shooters in our club who, at 200 yards, shoot groups that can be covered with a quarter.

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF sharpshooter scope is 3x power. Very basic.<br><br>The common infantryman cannot assimilate so much information. Most infantry engagements in our environment is going to be 100m and less. And it will  likely be instinctive shooting that would kill your enemy, not an aimed shot. Its the stress of the battle and the fleeting target that would cause the common soldier to squeeze off on an opportunistic and instincitve basis. Applies in urban and jungle warfare.<br><br>As for the officers and specs, we don't even get the chance most times to squeeze off a few rounds. Most of the time, is ensuring no one ends up shooting his friend, making sure that the troops are deployed and covering correct, spotting the enemy and directing fire (to the best ability, considering what I just said about instinctive shooting and battle stress).  So, no chance even at officer or NCO level, to practice the theories , even if we have the ability to read up on it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha.... you actually stumbled on one of the useful features of the sharpshooter scope. It is commonly used by the infantryman as a sort of spotter scope, since not all chaps are issued with the binoculars.<br><br>By the way, it is not meant to be a sniper scope, since this is a different instrument altogether. The sharpshooter scope is just to enhance the infantry sections firepower by enabling some of the chaps to lay down more accurate covering fire. It is not meant to pick-off targets at long distances... but it enables the section leader to have more options for covering fire during an assault.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Using a mounted riflescope as a spotting scope might be useful out in the battlefield, but doing likewise in a non-military situation (say, when hunting) can potentially get you into deep trouble, especially if you use it to identify people. Why? Something else besides the scope is being aimed at the subject.<br><br>MG</div>

When mounted the reticle will be about 1cm higher than the iron sights - if I remember correctly. You are right in that it is less comfortable and providing a cheek piece would help.<br><br>The thing about SAF rifle platoon sharpshooters is that the people selected to be sharpshooters are not necessarily the best shooters.<br><br>On the other hand, I constantly achieve marksmen grade at CTSS since recruit but I ended up as the platoon runner. I hardly get a chance to fire any shots during contact as I'm too busy talking on the 12kg PRC-77 radioset and trying to keep up with the PC. (Once in the confusion I called for MG fire too early and would've wiped out one of our section had the PC not quickly countermanded the order.)<br><br>Have you noticed that in the Russian army, the infantry sharpshooters are all armed with the SVD Dragunov? This is the same weapon that their true snipers use. I think this is because there isn't anything you can do to make the AK47 round accurate enough. The Dragunov uses the old 7.62x54mm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The section sharpshooter is not meant to be a sniper in the true sense. They are supposed to be "upgraded" riflemen with a low mag scope, just to give the rifle section some accurate covering fire.  Accurate fire can also be used as harassing fire on the enemy, without wasting too much ammo.<br><br>Anyway,  I heard many cases of the scope being damaged or lost in close terrain. It is an expensive piece of kit for the rifleman to pay up. Most of the time, the platoon chips in to help pay for the lost scope. More trouble than is worth.</div>
