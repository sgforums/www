            <div class='col-md body'>This is addressed to Specfore only:<br><br>A long burst but less than 8 rounds. No one said to empty the whole magazine. Besides, you don't want to expose yourself for too long.<br><br>Besides, this routine is used only when there is CONFIRMED enemy. That's why you throw a grenade in the first place. We do not throw grenades into every room nor do we fire blindly into every empty room.<br><br>So if there are confirmed enemies inside a room, I do not consider this a waste of ammo. After tossing a grenade in there is no guarantee all enemies are killed. Or some could come from other connecting rooms. The practice of firing a couple of bursts before you go in is so that anyone still alive will be encouraged to keep their heads down as you go in.<br><br>We are infantry, not SWAT.<br><br>Don't expect niceties or finese in our methods. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually you can get some pretty accurate shots with the present sharpshooter scopes on the stock M16S1, you just need to get used to it.<br><br>Let's face it, since the M16S1 is good out to 300m anyway, what's the point of a 27x or even a 10x scope?  In combat, your main aim (pardon the pun) is to bring the target down, not have a nice 3cm grouping.<br><br>And for those of you who have tried combat shooting, i.e. running, dodging, finding cover and then aiming, you'd realize you don't really have all that much time to find the target, not to mention the heavy breathing that causes your rifle to point all over the place.  The 27x scope will not allow you to find the target quickly enough before he plugs you with iron sights!<br><br>A sniper is different.  He often can take all day to slowly get into position, take up a nice comfortable position, have a spoter next to him to direct him on to target, adjust for wind and drop then shoot one rond through the head of an officer or signaller.  Much different from the infantry guy charging up and down a hill or running through buildings.<br><br>Weopons and their accessories are designed for a certain purpose lah.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Raptor937:</div><div class="quote_body">Come on throw in a range report <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>MG don't mind me asking, is it possible to use a 9mm heavy buffer spring for shooting 5.56mm?<br><br>Any 9mm builds?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Huh? Range report? What's there to report? I pulled the trigger, the rifle went BANG, the bullet hit the paper, I was happy!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Okay, here's a brief RR:<br><br>Since this was a new rifle, I needed to perform that wretched "barrel break-in" routine (shoot 10 rounds, pausing between each shot to clean the bore, then shoot 100 rounds, pausing every 10 rounds to clean the bore). I was shooting my tried-and-tested 55 gr. handloads that I normally use in my ARs with 1-in-9 twist barrels (my 24" varmint AR has a 1-in-8" twist barrel, and gets fed a different diet of handloads).<br><br>I also managed to zero the regular iron sights during the break-in. Very little windage correction was needed on the rear sight, indicating that the barrel was indexed correctly into the upper receiver, with no inadvertent offset to tilt the front sight base. Some other ARs, particulary the Bushmasters, have their barrels overtorqued into the upper receiver at the factory, resulting in a tilted front sight base and requiring massive amounts of left windage correction in the rear sight to properly zero.<br><br>No misfeeds or jams were encountered during the break-in, and the rifle was consistently holding sub-4" groups at 100 yards with the iron sights towards the end of the break-in. I was initially worried that the modifications I made to lighten the trigger pull of the 2-stage match trigger might cause the rifle to "double" or even go full auto, but that didn't happen.<br><br>After the break-in, I mounted the red dot sight and zeroed it. It's a cheap unit and I consider it disposable, but it held its zero surprisingly well through repeated double and triple taps. I planning on replacing it with a Hakko TacPoint red dot sight eventually.<br><br>A heavier buffer spring has the effect of mitigating the <span style="font-style: italic;">felt</span> recoil somewhat, but can potentially lead to misfeeds if it prevents the bolt carrier from cycling completely, especially if a cartridge with less-than-normal powder is encountered.<br><br>Using a heavier buffer (not spring) like the H-buffer intended for the 9mm version also has the effect of mitigating felt recoil <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> reducing the cyclic rate in full-auto fire.<br><br>MG<br><br></div>
