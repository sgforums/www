              <p>Few months old news but thought that i brought it up since the South China Sea is getting Crowded.....</p>
              <p>Vietnam's $1.8 billion deal with Russia for six Kilo-class submarines is a substantial order for the tiny, struggling country, whose annual military budget is estimated at just $3.6 billion, according to Jane's Intelligence Review.</p>
              <p>While not a signal of an arms race, "it's something that is pretty clearly a response to Chinese buildups" of force in the area, said Womack — including China's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,353961,00.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">new submarine base</span></span></a> on Hainan Island, just off the Vietnamese coast.</p>
              <p>Defense experts say the newly ordered Russian subs — called "Black Holes" by the U.S. Navy for their ability to avoid detection — are designed for anti-sub and anti-ship warfare. They could help protect Vietnam's claims in the South China Sea and deny access to its more than 2,000 miles of coastline.</p>

              <p>Vietnam may look as if they have recovered but they are deeply in debt despite all the revenues that they earn from the large offshore oil and gas resources - and is due to the deep seated corruption at all levels of society and government.</p>
              <p>The Vietnamese are not technically useless, and are smarter and more intelligent than you are led to believe.</p>
              <p>They may look like "Ah Bengs" but that hide the tremendous brain power, intellect and determination in the Vietnamese.</p>
              <p>For a period of more then 40 years of continuously fighting the French Colonial Government, then with the US military involvement in the politics of North vs South Vietnam - it was this determination and intellectual prowess that saw the Vietnamese being militarily victorious despite the limited resources.</p>
              <p>When China attacked the northern provinces of Vietnam to punish her for invading into Cambodia, the Vietnamese had inflicted heavy casualties on China's PLA military.</p>
              <p>Do not under-estimate the Vietnamese - as they are actually ethnically Chinese, and was one of China's provinces for more then a thousand years, and had fought at least three wars with the Emperor of China so as to maintain their heavy streak of independence</p>

              <p>can't comment about SG....but disagreed on your perception on Vietnamese folks.  </p>
              <p>First n foremost they send all their top brain to Moscow. They are all Russian trained. Most of them speak 3 to 4 languages -- French, Russian, Viet and now English. I spend a semester with some of these guys in States side. (they were sponsored by USAID.) Trust me they are up there.</p>
              <p>What they lack are govt resources to fund more of their people for higher education.</p>

              <h1>China's Underground Submarine Base Scrutinized</h1>
              <p class="byline">by <a href="/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100981"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Jackie Northam</span></span></a>,2008</p>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <p>The new base is close to vital sea lanes in the South China Sea and Strait of Malacca, which China is determined to protect. The location could give China better access — and dominance — over disputed territories, such as the Parcel Islands and Spratley Islands in the South China Sea. The naval facility will also give China more leverage over Taiwan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note about the base is a underground facilities......(Yep!! so much for military intention)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An underground nuclear submarine base on China's Hainan Island is drawing scrutiny from the United States and India.</p>
              <p>According to satellite imagery on the Web sites of Jane's Intelligence Review and the Federation of American Scientists, the base has a sea entrance wide enough to allow submarines to enter the underground facilities. The photograph reveals what appears to be a ballistic missile submarine moored to one of the piers outside.</p>

              <p>Sometimes you should listen critically to the keen observation of LKY who said that with the Mekong River as the dividing line, those people living East of the Mekong are clearly hardworking, industrious and are a focus lot of ethnic groups as seen in the population living in Vietnam, China, Korea and Japan.</p>
              <p>While those living West of the Mekong River are seen as idyllic, pastoral, apathetic, less energetic and less focus - as seen in the population in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, and the natives in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Yes, those living in Korea and Japan are off-shoots of the early tribal clans in China that migrated to these new countries to form new tribes and new clans - which can be seen in the morphing of their written words that had Chinese origin.</p>
              <p>Do you seriously doubt that a group of Ah Bengs could have defeated first the French and the Americans in the two wars that lasted from 1950s till 1974 ?</p>
              <p>They have the tenacity and intelligence to adapt and change with the times, and the newer generations are now educated overseas in Europe and the USA - with scholarships or private funds from either their own family or from the community.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately for Vietnam, since achieving peace in 1974 - they remain hamstrung by the need to maintain some semblance of their political ideology in managing their economy, while China had no qualms in separating political ideology from managing their economy while keeping it for governance.</p>
              <p>Is Singapore afraid of progress in Vietnam ?</p>
              <p>Singapore is helping the Vietnamese to quietly move away from Communist ideology by providing funds and scholarships to train their Civil Servants and educate their most brilliant students in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore has also helped the Vietnamese in building industrial parks that have all the infrastructural features similar to Singapore, and have encouraged Government Linked Companies to capitalise on the new relationships by investing inside Vietnam.</p>
              <p>All these are to help the Vietnamese to adapt and become absorbed into the global market economy, and at the same time creating opportunities for ourselves with the building of goodwill in bilateral ties.</p>
              <p>Vietnam has more then 60 percent of her population of approximately 80 million that is below 30 years of age, which makes it a potent force for change in the next thirty to fifty years.</p>
              <p>Many are educated up to university level, holding more then one degree that are earned from local universities, and will then take a third degree from some overseas universities in the previous Russian Communist bloc.</p>
              <p>There were many superb engineers that had returned to Vietnam in the mid-1960s to contribute to the war effort, and are now in their mid-40 to late-50s - and have creative engineering skills and experiences.</p>
              <p>If you have not lived or worked in Vietnam and immersed yourself into their communities, do not judge them superficially from some narrow local experience with Vietnamese in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Vietnamese are prepared to sacrifice themselves for their own people, and continue to do so to overcome hard times.</p>
              <p>They can be considered a nation with true nationalism in their hearts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can you do the same for your fellow Singaporeans ?</p>

              <p>Hey Kid, try harder if you want to score points.</p>
              <p>With your presented efforts seen, it only show the dark side of a frustrated kid trying to be bigger then what life has given to you.</p>
              <p>Terminator ?</p>
              <p>You could pretend to be <em>"Arnnie Schwarzenegger"</em> - as it is much easier by eating more sausages - it will help you to grow faster.</p>
