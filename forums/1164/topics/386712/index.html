              <p>Its a propaganda article for local consumption. Its funny when ST decides to reproduce such articles which are factually inaccurate.</p>
                              <p>(a) What makes the author think that Su-30 maintenance cost are not far greater than the Mig-29? The engines are way more sophisticated, the avionics from multiple sources and again far more sophisticated. The parts way more than the migs esp with multiple integration issues bet western and russki tech. Suffers from the same inefficient, middleman procurement practices. Even the pilots have to been sent to India for training.</p>
                              <p>(b) The Su-30 is indeed more capable than the F-15/F-16 in the following areas:</p> 
                          <p>- It has no aesa radar which means it reveals its location far better than the F-15/F-16s;</p>
                              <p>- It carries A2A missiles that are outranged by the AMRAAMs not to mention more likely to miss which means it is indeed better at getting shot down than the F-15/F-16 not to mention that none of its BVR missiles has been officially credited with a kill yet.</p>
                              <p>- It carries EW/self protection equipment that is far inferior than the F-15/F-16 systems which means its likelihood of getting shot down by sams/A2A missiles is indeed far better than the F-15/F-16.</p>
                              <p>- It carries a 2nd rate western targeting pod that is 2-3 times less range than the sniper pods that equip the F-15/F-16s which means that its A2G capability is definitely better than the F-15/F-16s in hitting the targets closer to launch range.</p>
                              <p>- It has far better non-mission capable and non-serviceability rates which means planes will stay on the ground for maintenance/out of comission far longer than the F-15/F-16. Sadly, the F-16 has only the highest mission capable rates of any fighter in the USAF inventory.</p>
                  <p>- Its equipment are not designed to last meaning it will have to be replaced far more often than the F-15/F-16s. The PLAAF recently decom their early su-27s after 20 years of service (which is better than the 15 yr rmaf migs). Unfortunately, the F-15/F-16s can only last for 30-40+ years and requires upgrading.</p>
                              <p>- It can use the far more inaccurate and unreliable munitions that the russkis have. F-15/F-16s can unfortunately only rely on the (dual mode) AIM-9X, GBU-54s (Laser JDAMs), JSOWs, JDAMs, Paveways that have recently entered its inventory.</p>
                              <p>- It benefits from russian/indian air training techniques that have outmanouvred western pilots in every war that never happened but sadly kena shot down in almost every A2A encounter that did happened.</p>
                              <p>Too lazy to cite more examples that the suks are way better than the F-15s/F-16s. One cent money, one cent value.</p>
                              <p>Fantastic, get more of them pls.</p>
                              <p>P.s. rsaf does look at $ before procuring. Mindef just lousier at middlemen resource allocation than the MY Mod.</p><p></p>

              <p>The SU30-MKK in an air-to-air  and  one-to-one scenario is superior to the F15 and F16.  Its air to air weaponry is , at least on paper ,  is also  <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">superior</span></em></strong> to AMRAMM and AIM9X. The SU30-MKK as configured for RMAF duty is therefore a very formidable aircraft not to be messed around with. </p>
              <p>But, with what can be seen with issues in quality / availability of  pilots &amp; maintenance / readiness issues,  the numbers of operational  SU30-MKKs and ability to sustain sortie generation rates in a real war scenario, the number of planes that RMAF can put into the sky is probably low.</p>
              <p>Any excellent combat aircraft fielded  against the SAF will have to contend with large numbers of F15s, F16s, F5Es,  an integrated &amp; layered air defence system comprising AWACs, multiple ground static &amp; mobile radars,  Formidable Class frigates,  mobile SAM / gun units etc.    </p>
              <p>Finally, even in a one-to-one scenario, aircraft &amp; weaponry superiority does not necessarilly  guarantee  victory as many examples of air to air combat have shown.  </p>

              <p>The R-77 is outranged by the AIM-120C-5 (not even discussing the C-7). The R-77M which would outrange the AIM-120C-7 has not entered service (nor is there any indication it would). No surprise considering that Russia hasn't done much investment in A2A missile tech. The recent article 170-1 upgrade claims to expand range to 110km but how far that goes into the SD export version is anyone's guess. Even then, the C-7 will likely outrange it still.</p>
                          <p>The R-27 is a semi-active homing (ie requires radar lock all the way) or IR (and no IR missile seeker can go 120km) which suffers from the same reason why the far-longer ranged Phoenix was superceded by the AMRAAM. Not to mention that the export versions are again inferior to the russki claimed ones.</p>
                          <p>AMRAAM has nine officially credited fighter kills. 6 of them Mig-29s (3 each by the F-15Cs and F-16s), 1 Mig-23, 1 Mig 25 and 1 J-22. The R-77 has zilch and Rosbonexport's brochures even credit the R-27 with a better pk than the R-77.</p>
                          <p>I'd like to read any paper that supports the contention that Russki missiles are actually better.</p>
                          <p>RSAF has 24 F-15s (o/o), 60 F-16C/Ds and 50+ F-5s (which are due to be replaced by F-35s). That's 134 fighters to 18 suks, 8 hornets, 7 F-5s of which 1 lost an engine and 2-3 are the non-BVR fighter variants which mean 4+ to 1 advantage not counting the reserve A-4s vs non-BVR Hawks.</p>
                          <p>The rmaf will need 6 more sqns of suks (108) to achieve parity in numbers and that will take at least 30 years at assumed enhanced rates of allocated budget by which time the F-35 will have replaced the F-5s and possibly some F-16 sqns.</p>
                  <p>We can, of course, maintain the illusion that the suks are as capable as the F22 in which case, would be more capable than the F-35. lol. Happy New Year magic illusion entertainment.</p>

              <p>You mean Venezuela?</p>
              <p>Anyways, the range advantages of the R-77M is pretty slight.  Nothing that can't be nullified by better launch perimeters, first look and shoot. From what I understand, the active range is slightly shorter, thus requiring the fighter to support the missile slightly longer unless he wishes to drop it.</p>

              <p>since they are getting the Su30 which is better than our F15/16 and even F35 (since they claimed it is better than F22), so we better faster buy more more fighters.</p>

              <p>I would hesitate to say the Russians aren't investing in new Air to Air missiles. The Indians are putting money into the PAK-DA, and likely, that implies new missiles, along with an AESA radar which is likely on the cards. The Russians have demoed a few AESA radars (not to mention a rather interesting wing edge S-band radar) as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AND DSTA anyway is known for being rather cheapskate so you can bet that they would bargain for the best deal which is a balance of tech and money.</p>
