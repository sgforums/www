I, personally, take note of some, and they are very objective and professional...  <strong>LazerLordz </strong> is one of them. There are about 8 that I see visiting military forums. Not many gung-ho ones... lei<br><br>Please PM me the forums in question.. I'm quite interested at what they post... since you have made me curious.</div>
