            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think so, the tanks are roughly equal in armor and mobility (the Abrams armor is probably heavier, the americans being crazy about DU). In a slug out fight I suppose the outcome is more dependent on crew then tank, though I suspect the M1 DU package will give it an edge over the Leopard 2, which due to certain conservations in european states about using nuclear material, is relys on less effective materials to make up it's armor.<br><br>However in the generally tatical sense, when it comes to factoring in most of the fog of war and stuff into the M1A2 vs Leopard 2 battles, the advanced digitalized technology of the Americans will start to show it's edge over the Leopard 2, which is by comparism, relatively blind and deaf very fast.<br><br>IVIS technology and intergrated databus gives M1A2 unit far more situtational awareness and response times then any Leopard 2 unit (which is very important, given tanks are largely blind), and that's going to be a definate advantage. FCS of the M1A2 is superior above any tank currently, given the new upgraded databus the blackboxes that control FCS makes up a sizeable proportion of the tank's cost), and thus the M1A2 Abrams can shoot more accucrately then any tank in the market today. Any body rooting for the Leopard 2 dun seem to have any valid reason rather then rabid anti-americanism...<br><br>Unfortunately the reason why we dun see many M1A2s around opr being deployed is because they are expensive to build, and hence the army is still relying on it's M1A1 tanks to do the job while they slowly filter in the A2 models. All of the american tanks in Gulf War2 are A1 variants.<br><br>And by the way, the M1A1 has preformed very well in GW2 so far, most of the supposed knock outs were shots to the thinly armoured rear areas of the tank. That kind of ambush woulds have taken out any MBT. However when the Abrams was not ambushed or surprised, the Iraqis found that it was pratically impossible to destroy. Their RPGs simply left burn marks and their 125mm tank cannons bounced off the frontal armor of the A1 like peashooter ammo. That's the reason why the Americans happy happy dare to drive their tanks to the heart of Badhdad in the midst of heavy RPG fire and all the nonsense the Iraqis were throwing at them, the Abrams will be relatively unaffected unless their crews got careless or failed to check six.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The DU armor layer is intergrated to the Abrams armor package along with the Chobhamm package. This means that the Abrams actually has the heaviest protection package of any MBT currently deployed, including the Leopard 2. The Abrams is proof (from the front) against the 120mm gun that both it and the Leopard 2 carries, the frontal armor of the Leopard 2 however, cannot keep out the advanced thirty-one ratio "silver bullet" APFSDS of the Abrams.<br><br>If both tanks slugged it out front to front, and even if the Leopard 2 got off the first shot, it will be unable to penetrate the Abrams frontal armor at any range, however the Abrams can penetrate the frontal armor of the Leopard 2 quite easily, and at distance as well.<br><br>The Leopard 2 is a good tank, and will prove itself well against soviet-bloc tanks. But note that the Abrams design is actually newer then the Leopard 2 by several years, the Abrams spots a better ballistic shape (making better use of the armor) in accordance to heavier armor as well.</div>

Even a 50 ton tank is slightly too heavy.  We cannot hope that SAF will replace the SM1 with anything other than a 105mm or 120mm light tank.  The Centurions however would most likely be replaced by an older generation of MBT, my guess would be Mekarva 3 (Baz???) or some upgraded version of M-60A3.<br><br>SAF was reported looking at getting AMX-30B2 at some time, but I seriously doubt that would be good for tropic region.<br><br>So, my ideal armoured force for SAF would be<br><br>1. 3,6,9 Div to replace 2 armoured brigade SM1 tanks with a locally made light tank, eg.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some thoughts<br><br>Based on current doctrine, 3,6,9 div organic armour brigade won't be a heavy armour brigade, so can forget anything that has an MLC load class of above 30 (approx 35 metric tons based on engineer calculation). They only play a support role to provide heavy direct firepower and thrust. Most probably replacement will be a variant of Bionix with 120mm cannon turrut or worse case stick to the current SM1. At most in close combat (FIBUA), this light tank will wear a "bra protection kit" consisting of reactive armour, additional armour plates and barang barang hangings outside the tank to soften the impact from HEAT rounds like RPG-7, AT-4, recoiless rifle etc. In this configuration, the light tank mobility will be greatly reduced but that won't be a problem as FIBUA fighting does not require cross country performance say 65km/hr.<br><br>So any thoughts of new heavy armour will be the 32 div. Maybe we can get a few of the 2nd hand M1A1 after this iraqi war <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Joe Black:</div><div class="quote_body">So, my ideal armoured force for SAF would be<br><br>1. 3,6,9 Div to replace 2 armoured brigade SM1 tanks with a locally made light tank, eg.

Any comment.</div></blockquote>No way, the russian T-90 is actually an improved version of the T-72, the Abrams will have little trouble fraggin' it in a stand up fight. Besides, the T-90 was built on the old soviet doctorine of mass numbers of inferior quality tanks. One on one, the M1 series has greater range, accuracy and armor, not to mention mobility.<br><br>For russian MBT that stand a fair chance against western MBTs, look at the Black Eagle and the exist-on-paper-only T-95.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not want to put a weight limit on any of our future armoured systems, but I am in favour of a 40 ton system with modular armor that can be adjusted to various needs. Mobility will be an issue as well, and must be enough to keep the Malaysians reeling back, and defeat their MBTs in a stand up fight as well.</div>
