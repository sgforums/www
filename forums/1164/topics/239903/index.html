Depth restrictions were placed on all submarines after an on-board flood almost sank HMAS Dechaineux in 2003.</blockquote>--http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21293295-31477,00.html<br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21299464-31477,00.html" rel="nofollow">Periscope fault leaves our subs partially blind, Cameron Stewart<br>, February 28, 2007</a></strong><br><blockquote>The navy has become so concerned by the problematic periscopes that it has commissioned a series of studies to explore ways to improve or replace them.<br><br>The so-called search-and-attack periscopes on the Collins-class submarines are described by the navy as being "critical" to the "mission effectiveness" of the submarine fleet.<br><br>Crammed with hi-tech sensors and stealth characteristics, they are a far cry from the simple periscopes portrayed in Hollywood war movies.<br><br>They are needed to give the commander a visual sighting of an enemy and, if they break down, a submarine is partially blinded and would be a liability in battle.<br><br>But after more than a decade at sea, the search-and-attack periscopes are wearing out.<br><br>"The periscopes were originally specified and designed over 15 years ago," a Defence spokesman said.<br><br>"Obsolescence and normal wear and tear dictate that the periscopes are assessed and their maintenance routines reviewed."<br><br>Defence sources say the periscopes in the six submarines had so many faults last year that the repair company, BAE Systems, could not keep up.<br><br>Relief for the repairers has come only this year because the submarines are spending less time at sea because of an acute shortage of crew.<br><br>The issue is a setback for the submarine, which has overcome serious teething problems to become one of the country's most effective defence assets.<br><br>Sources say some of the periscope breakdowns have undermined submarine missions but none has been serious enough to force one back to shore.<br><br>"Periscopes have a built-in redundancy to ensure that defects do not adversely affect operations," a Defence spokesman said.<br><br>The navy has commissioned a study to examine the future of the periscopes and help the navy plan for next-generation technology.<br><br>In December, the navy also commissioned a report on "periscope spares usage and maintenance effectiveness" to ensure that the problems could be properly repaired. The periscopes provide the primary sensors for the Collins combat system.<br><br>The sensor systems on the periscopes include optical and electro-magnetic sensors for all-weather, around-the-clock surveillance, situation awareness and target acquisition.<br><br>"These provide the Collins with its stealth characteristics and are critical to its mission effectiveness," the navy says.<br><br>Despite their current problems, the periscopes are a vast improvement on those used in the 1990s. A 1999 Defence report said the first periscopes on the Collins-class fleet vibrated badly and did not focus properly.<br><br>Meanwhile, Opposition defence spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon yesterday said revelations in The Australian yesterday about the acute shortage of submariners were an indictment on Defence Minister Brendan Nelson.<br><br>"A recruitment, retention and skills crisis in the Australian Defence Force is undermining Australia's national security," Mr Fitzgibbon said.<br><br>"Revelations that staffing shortfalls of 30per cent in the submarine arm are hampering submarine operations highlight minister Nelson's failure to properly manage these key defence assets."<br><br>The navy has been forced to cut the number of sailing days because of the acute shortage of trained submariners.</blockquote>--http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21299464-31477,00.html<br><br>3.<strong>again,why they dunt have forward planning?</strong><br>The man power shortage and problematic periscopes did not<br>appear over night.pl tell me why??</div>
