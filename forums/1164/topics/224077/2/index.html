            <div class='col-md body'>to escape reservist i find is a foolish act and immature act.<br><br>Just that now i m in China and my reservist is going to be like 2 days later. To prepare and go back SG just to do reservist i find is a little uncommon sense to do that.<br><br>Moreover i am using Chinese here as a supplier for my goods and services that i offer in Singapore. I cannot leave behind and customer left me i have left nothing.<br><br>have debts i have to continue to work and earn to pay back some debts that may cost other companies to sue me if the service render.<br><br>serving NS is compulsory but when to do it and making up is not a problem for me. Just not at the very moment where i am now in China.<br><br>Now is below 6 months ... i guess not need exit permit and but i need to travel to HK very often to get my stuff send over.<br><br>will it affect?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was not empolyed but i started a business on 1 Dec which is very near to my reservist date.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by moca:<br><strong>If you are in SG and didn't show up for reservist, sure DB.<br><br>But being overses with a valid visa is a good first step for leniency. You will not escape being charged, just try to avoid DB.<br><br>You have to first plead guilty, but must prepare some kind of document to prove you are employed during the time that you were called up. And then say that your family members can't understand English, didn't open your mail or something...<br><br>I don't know your situation, but does this help?<br><br>I was charged for AWOL and fined when I first left the country to work overseas 10 years ago.<br><br>When I reported back to MINDEF to face charges, there was at first an interview. The officer was firm but very polite and I was given a chance to explain the reasons:<br><br>...when I first left the country, my battalion HQ clerk told me no need to apply for Exit permit from MINDEF, just write a letter to the Bn S1 or something, which I was dumb enough to believe him.<br><br>I also handed over my documents proving my employment status overseas.<br><br>After that, they had a conference amongst themselves.<br><br>Later, I was loudly marched in and formally charged and fined SGD400 after pleading guilty to AWOL and not contesting the charge. If you contest the charge and the punishment (fine), you can go for higher court martial. If you lose that one, MP will "love you long time" in DB. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I believe there are many reasons I was not thrown into DB:<br><br>* Firstly, I made contact with my unit and MINDEF [b]while still overseas</strong> to explain that I screwed up by not applying for Exit Permit etc.<br><br>* They gave me a date to report for charges and I showed up on time - very important.<br><br>* I had the necessary documents to prove my story and they believed it.<br><br>* My passport stamps proved I was away all the while even before they sent out the ICT call-up letter.<br><br>* Excellent service record throughout also helped. If you had ever been in trouble with army law, then bad news for you.<br><br>Oh, when you report, dress smartly in No 4, kiwi your boots and remember to address NCO's by their rank and officers as "sir".<br><br>Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go and do your reservist, otherwise you don't just lose your money.<br><br>You'll lose your freedom, your passport etc... every damn thing.<br><br>You weren't very smart to leave the country without an exit permit to begin with. Don't let one problem lead to even more problem that'll ruin your whole future.<br><br>As to your question about HK: if you fly to another country they won't be able to touch you as long as you're not on SG soil.<br><br>I have a friend who jumped police bail for a criminal but non-violent offence, left the country and have been away from SG for more than one decade. He hasn't even been to Malaysia for fear of extradition areements between he 2 countries.<br><br>He even managed to get his passport renewed in the SG embassy of another country without problem.<br><br>But his offence is a civil office and not army AWOL as he was already discharged for medical reasons when he was caught.<br><br>With AWOL they might inform Immigration, to begin with.<br><br>But his offence happened 10 years ago, they may have upgraded the computer systems now to make overseas renewal of passports impossible for fugitives.<br><br>But I am telling you running is silly. It might be difficult for you to think clearly now but I can tell you running will not solve anything and will compound your problems.<br><br>While I am telling you that you can run, but I am advising you to go and do your reservist. This is silly.</div>
