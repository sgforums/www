            <div class='col-md body'>If you are in SG and didn't show up for reservist, sure DB.<br><br>But being overses with a valid visa is a good first step for leniency. You will not escape being charged, just try to avoid DB.<br><br>You have to first plead guilty, but must prepare some kind of document to prove you are employed during the time that you were called up. And then say that your family members can't understand English, didn't open your mail or something...<br><br>I don't know your situation, but does this help?<br><br>I was charged for AWOL and fined when I first left the country to work overseas 10 years ago.<br><br>When I reported back to MINDEF to face charges, there was at first an interview. The officer was firm but very polite and I was given a chance to explain the reasons:<br><br>...when I first left the country, my battalion HQ clerk told me no need to apply for Exit permit from MINDEF, just write a letter to the Bn S1 or something, which I was dumb enough to believe him.<br><br>I also handed over my documents proving my employment status overseas.<br><br>After that, they had a conference amongst themselves.<br><br>Later, I was loudly marched in and formally charged and fined SGD400 after pleading guilty to AWOL and not contesting the charge. If you contest the charge and the punishment (fine), you can go for higher court martial. If you lose that one, MP will "love you long time" in DB. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I believe there are many reasons I was not thrown into DB:<br><br>* Firstly, I made contact with my unit and MINDEF <strong>while still overseas</strong> to explain that I screwed up by not applying for Exit Permit etc.<br><br>* They gave me a date to report for charges and I showed up on time - very important.<br><br>* I had the necessary documents to prove my story and they believed it.<br><br>* My passport stamps proved I was away all the while even before they sent out the ICT call-up letter.<br><br>* Excellent service record throughout also helped. If you had ever been in trouble with army law, then bad news for you.<br><br>Oh, when you report, dress smartly in No 4, kiwi your boots and remember to address NCO's by their rank and officers as "sir".<br><br>Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
