            <div class='col-md body'>Aye, it's you who misleads yourself due to your general ignorance of the whole situtation.<br><br>Of course everything wears our pretty fast in the desert. But the main question here is at what rate. Multi tonned wheeled units like the nonsense LAV-25 require almost constant replacing of their tires not to mention that ocassional overhaul of their overstressed delicate suspension and drive trains. In a worst case seneriao, good tracks can wistand up to three months in the desert before you really have to replace them, as all armored forces that have fought in the desert has found out.<br><br>In terms of battlefield replacability and recoverability, plus reliability, tracks certainly make it far better then tires.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In theory people have proposed that multi-tired units can still be mobile following the loss of wheels while tracks will be disabled and useless. Hence wheeled units will take less losses from mobility kills.<br><br>However in pratice this has proven otherwise. While tracked units are obviously vulnerable to losing tracks, the actual damage taken when a track is blown off or road wheel destroyed is usually salvagable. On the other hand, the superstructure of wheeled units tend to take extensive damage following the loss of the wheel, and while the unit might be able to limp back to base, there is a great percentage of the time that it will be a write off from the damage taken.<br><br>This is assuming the multi-ton wheeled unit does not write itself off by throwing it's own wheels doing high speed manuvers, which has destroyed quite a bit of LAV-25 by drivetrain damage and in some cases flipping following the loss of the wheel.<br><br>Of course, tracks themselves take up a smaller profile on the unit, are less vulnerable to small arms and permit an optimised armour geometry to give the unit maximum protection. Wheeled units have large, easily targeted wheels on their side, interfere with hull geometry, and result in a high-cg, tall profile, unstable, under armoured unit that flips at easily overturns at high speed or trying to avoid stray dogs.<br><br>If anything, losses from mobility kills are higher in wheeled units then in tracked ones.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey all,<br>I think i'd better say something before this degrades into another 'wheels or tracks' argument gets too intense.<br><br>My purpose of starting this topic was to discuss any possible use for the Terrex within the SAF's orbat. There seems little use of arguing about the pros and cons of wheels and tracks within these parameters since the SAF has already shown an overall preference to using tracks, as evidenced by the development and purchase of vehicles such as the Bionix and Bronco, and the continued use of other tracked equipment, despite any arguments about the advantages that a wheeled platform might provide.<br><br>In any case, my intention was to discuss about any periphery roles that wheeled armoured vehicles could play in the SAF, aside from central armoured roles which have already been taken up by tracked units in the SAF. Some suggestions have been interesting such as home security and peacekeeping, which are probably seen to be more low-intensity in nature. I had a friend even suggest mounting a multiple anti-air rocket launcher system similar to the air defense version of the LAV.<br><br>My point is that perhaps we could concentrate on weaponry and configurations instead of whacking each other over the head with arguments over tracks or wheels. I am not for or against tracks or wheels. The fact is that the SAF likes (or, at least, appears to like) tracks in central roles.<br><br></div>

Even going at full tilt on a road, a 60 ton Abrams tank does not leave concrete spall in its wake, even when it slams the brakes that brings it to a halt from 60kph to 0 in 10 meters.

The idea that tracks are bad on roads is a misconception. The real reason why we transport them on trailers is far more logical, and pratical. It saves wear and tear on these expensive units, and it isn't really wise to drive from the limited vision confines of an AFV in peacetime unless they really have to. What if they ran over ah ma because they could not see her? It's far safer and cheaper to transport them on HETs...</div></blockquote>Err our M-113s n Bx tracks DONT have rubber coating to do that.

Given the low tactical threat level in the mostly rural area they're patrolling, i guess it's ok to use such an open vehicle. Besides, it's good PR too, it was seen on tv how the peacekeepers would give out combat rations to kids as they were passing thru'. The low profile and openness of the LSV makes the peacekeepers 'accessible'. Of course, this is both good and bad.<br><br>Whether the APC or the terrex would be perceived as threatening would then depend on the situation. In Timor Leste, the civilians there view the UN peacekeepers favorably. But as y'all know, if we send peacekeepers to iraq - i don't think patrolling in an LSV would be a sane idea. (I mean, for all the totalitarian tendencies of saddam, i still find it amazing he allowed his people to bear arms - maybe it's part of the arab culture. That fat bastard in DPRK would never have allowed that).<br><br>On the subject of being 'threatening' - personally i believe if peacekeepers are bent on showing goodwill to the civilians, a wheeled vehicle would be a good idea. Just the very sound of an armour tank or carrier engine roaring and metal tracks tearing down the road would be enough to give me goosebumps</div>
