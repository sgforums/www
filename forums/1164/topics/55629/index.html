            <div class='col-md body'>Look at the water jet system on the Terrex , i believe the terrex can be modified for amphibous operations. The normal Terrex with modular weapon system can be use as an Infantry Fighting Vehicle while 105mm armed Terrex can be use as a fire support vehicle in any assualt.<br><br>We might want to intergrate the Barak SAM system on the terrex to cover the need for a Armour Anti-aircraft plateform or as a Signal vehicle due to her speed, mobility and ferrying capability.<br><br>The terrex chassis can be use as a study for our light tank project. The wheeled Terrex give us more mobility and speed that any of our counterparts in our region and with a 120mm gun , the Terrex can be equally devastating. Of course the Terrex might be vulnerable to small arms in the<br>wheel region , but it might be a point worth considering in exchange for mobility.........</div>

However, there could be a foreign market for such vehicles (peackeeping, etc), and ST would try to sell them to foreign customers.<br>If other countries want to use them (wheeled) as frontline IFV instead, and get killed, that's their problem. The US LAV program has already generated a large amount of discussions in other forums. Malaysia is looking for 8x8 LAVs to replace their 6x6 Sibmas and 4x4 Condors.<br>As as I know, locally, the SAF uses heavier tracked armored vehicles for frontline units. All wheeled armored vehicles are used by 2nd line units. Also, ST has the Bronco as a high mobility tracked vehicle, but I'm not too sure about it being armored at all. Come to think of it - ST has produced tracked APC/IFVs (Bionix), a wheeled APC/IFV prototype (Terrex), high mobility tracked vehicle (Bronco),  and currently developing a light tank. So what is missing is a MBT.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we can restrict our wheeled vehicles to some roles.<br><br>I cannot imagine a tracked vehicle tearing through all the runways!!! For air field defence a wheeled vehicle might be superior. Less damage to road surface, quieter response (against infiltrators). Also they are likely to meet non-conventional infantry forces that are lightly armed and do have have arty and armour support.<br><br>Also for homeland defence wheeled vehicles might be better, again mobility on the many roads in singapore. Our homeland forces also is not expected to face a very serious threat. If 50 T-72s mananged to land on East Coast and is tearing down the ECP towards downtown CBD, I don't expect a unit of  V200 or Terrex to stop them, because by that time, it means that the SAF had already failed as it didn't prevent the tanks from landing in the first place and that also means that our frontline "forward" forces are already defeated elsewhere.... time to surrender.<br><br>Also must think about cost. Tracks are nicer but much more expensive to operate. Also must use Trailers to transport tracked vehicles around so as to protect our roads.<br><br>Also Singapore is more active in peace keeping. I would rather see our Timor Peacekeepers in a Terrex compared to a exposed Styker.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It will be good if all our infantry units (SIRs) are equipped with the Terrex to replace the 3-ton or buses which we currently used.
