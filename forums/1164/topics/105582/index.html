            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from F-16.Net<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>F-16ES (Enhanced Strategic)</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album17/aaa.jpg"><br><br>The proposed extended-range F-16ES (Enhanced Strategic) version of the Fighting Falcon was originally developed for the Israeli strike fighter competition. In order to provide increased range, conformal fuel tanks which hold an extra 3,200 lb. of fuel were to be fitted. When combined with a 320-gal. centerline tank and two 600-gal. underwing tanks, the F-16ES has an unrefueled mission radius of 1,025 mi. when carrying a typical strike load of two 2,000-lb. bombs and four air-to-air missiles. That represents a 40% increase over the range of the current U.S. Air Force Block 50 F-16C and is roughly equivalent to that of the F-15E, according to Lockheed. However, this project lost out to the McDonnell Douglas Strike Eagle in the competition.<br><br>In addition to the conformal fuel tanks, the F-16ES also features an internal forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system, which basically replicates the capabilities of the LANTIRN navigation and targeting system without the drag associated with external pods. Following the loss of the Israeli strike fighter competition to the F-15I Strike Eagle (the Israeli export version of the F-15E), Lockheed has resurrected the project following an expression of interest by several other nations. A.o., Lockheed offered the F-16 Block 60 (sometimes referred to as the F-16U) to the United Arab Emirates. It includes the conformal fuel tanks and the internal FLIR.<br><br>Flight Testing<br><br>Lockheed Ft. Worth Co. began flight-testing with a leased Block 30 F-16C ( #83-1120 ED) fitted with the shapes representing the conformal tanks and one of two external FLIR turrets (the lower ball turret). The aircraft first flew on November 5, 1994 and has completed flight testing in January 1995. A total of 21 flight test were conducted after a rapid-prototyping program to gather aerodynamic data on the external features of the F-16ES. Seventeen flights were geared toward evaluating the aircraft's handling characteristics with two 24-ft. conformal fuel tanks. According to these tests, departure resistance and recoverability changes seemed minimal. The remaining four tests focused on the impact on inlet air flow and engine operability of a lower ball turret for a nose-mounted, internal FLIR system. The F-16ES also features an upper ball turret for the internal FLIR system, which was evaluated in a previous program.<br><br>[/url]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>F-16E/F Block 60</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album42/aai.sized.jpg"><br><br>History<br><br>A scale model of an early design phase in the block 60 development. It never matured this way. (Bill Sweetman photo)<br><br>The Block 60 designation was originally reserved back in 1989. It was to be the F/A-16 which sported a 30 mm cannon and strengthened wing structure for anti-tank weapons such as 7.62 mm min pods. This aircraft was briefly in consideration to replace the A-10 warthog. The "original" Block 60 did not go into production, and its designation basically ends the series of adding another block.<br><br>The "new" Block 60 F-16 represents an evolutionary step ahead of the current Block 50 aircraft. At first, the Block 60 was developed featuring a delta wing design. Through the development phase, LMTAS altered its strategy and decided to just start from the basic F-16 structure without altering too much on its design.<br>Structure &amp; Avionics<br>The Block 60 features an enormous amount of new capabilities. For one thing, the Fighting Falcon Block 60's range is extended with addition of fuselage mounted conformal fuel tanks and wing tanks, similar to the F-16ES and Block 50/52 Plus.<br><br>Secondly, the Northrop Grumman AN/ASQ-28 IFTS (Internal FLIR and Targeting System) replaces the pods in earlier aircraft. With state-of-the art components and packaging technology, the Internal FLIR Targeting System (IFTS) incorporates an advanced multi-functional FLIR/laser system into the F-16 nose to improve lethality and survivability with lower weight and drag. The elimination of bulky pods also enhances stealthiness.<br><br>Thirdly, there is an integrated electronic warfare suite with the Northrop Grumman 'Falcon Edge' internal electronic countermeasures system, the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-80 "Agile Beam Radar" with AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array), an electronic warfare management system, fiber-optic avionics data bus and up to eight chaff/flare dispensers, as well as advanced friend or foe. The aircraft's advanced avionics suite has room available for future improvements. The Block 60's modular mission computer has a processing throughput of 12.5 million instructions per second and provides sensor and weapons integration.<br><br>The first picture of a UAE block 60 F-16 taken at the unofficial roll-out. (LMTAS photo)<br><br>The ALQ-165 electronic countermeasures system, also known as the Airborne Self-Protection Jammer (ASPJ), is a sophisticated, high-power jamming system developed to fulfill both U.S. Navy and Air Force requirements - although the USAF abandonned the program a while ago. Missile warning systems on the Block 60 provide advanced warning of approaching missiles so the pilot can activate countermeasures in time. The Block 60 F-16 can accommodate both active and passive missile warning systems currently under development.<br><br>Any F-16 pilot can perform mission tasks with his head up and his eyes looking out of the cockpit and with his hands on the flight controls. The Block 60 adds to this excellent pilot-aircraft interface by incorporating three advanced 5-inch by 5-inch color displays. The aircraft has wiring and space allocated for a helmet-mounted cuing system that can be added to improve pilot situation awareness.<br><br>The Block 60 F-16 retains the full armament capability of the Block 50's and adds several new capabilities. The Block 60's basic design and weapon interfaces are compatible with projected future weapons including new air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-132 Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM). The aircraft will also support all-weather standoff weapons, such as the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM).<br><br>The Block 60 F-16 has been developed with planned growth improvements and technology advances in virtually all major areas, including engines, avionics, and weapons.<br>Production<br><br>So far, the Block 60 has only be sold to the United Arab Emirates. The total order stands for 80 aircraft compromising 55 single-seat E-models and 25 double-seat F-models. Deliveries will start in 2004 and run through 2007.<br><br>Specifications<br><br>Engine: One General Electric F110-GE-132 turbofan, rated at 19,000 lb.s.t. dry and 32,500 lb.s.t. with afterburning.<br><br>Performance: Maximum short-endurance speed: Mach 2.02 (1333 mph) at 40,000 feet.

            <div class='col-md body'>F-16/J79 FX Export Fighter<br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album22/aaa.sized.jpg"><br><br>Interesting history of our first Vipers..<br><br>In February of 1977, in a well-meaning but ultimately futile gesture, President Jimmy Carter announced a new arms transfer policy in an attempt to reduce arms proliferation throughout the world. Under this policy, American manufacturers could no longer sell to foreign air forces any combat aircraft that were the equal of those in the US inventory.<br><br>There were significant exceptions to this rule, e.g. the four NATO users of the F-16 and, as a special exception, the nation of Israel. Exceptions were also made for arms deliveries to Iran so that the Shah could continue to act as a bulwark against Soviet expansion in the Persian Gulf region.<br><br>At first, South Korea's request for F-16s was turned down under this new rule, but was later approved as a quid pro quo for pending US troop withdrawals from Korea. However, nations such as Jordan, Taiwan, and Venezuela were denied access to the F-16. To cater for the 'embargoed' air forces, the FX Export Fighter Program was proposed, calling for an aircraft satisfying the following criteria:<br><br>* Performance, cost &amp; capabilities should be between those of the F-5E and F-16A<br>* Multirole design (but optimized for the air-to-air role) and deliberately limited strike capabilities<br>* Payload/range performance had to be substantially inferior to that of contemporary fighters in the US inventory<br>* Deployment and maintenance had to be easier.<br><br>Finally, the design was to be such tat it was not easily upgradable without US help or permission. The DOD had no intent to sponsor the program, so the development of the FX Export Fighter depended entirely on the will of companies to take the financial risk.<br><br><strong>The J79-powered F-16 was initially offered to Venezuela as a substitute for the F-16A/B's that had originally been ordered. An evaluation team from Venezuela flew the F-16/79 in February of 1981. It was considered by as many as 20 other air arms, and briefings on the F16/79 were given to Austria, Jordan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.</strong><br><br>Perhaps this is why RSAF is looking EU-wards, especially in relation to technology sharing and having a say in developing MLUs.<br><br></div>
