You do bring up valid points of concern.<br><br>However, my opinion is that majority of Singaporeans (non-milnuts) don't really care to know if our "2nd hand tanks" are modern or not.  Nor do they even understand the difference between an AMX-13 SM1 light tank and a Leopard2A4 MBT.  For these people, who don't care to know, its already a bonus that they are informed that their money is used to buy military hardware regardless of their source being Mr Brown or Straits Times.<br><br>For those who naively believe that the RSAF bought 30 year old warplanes, and WW2 tanks to replace the SM1, they will realise their mistakes someday, perhaps thru an embarrassing discussion  with one of us milnuts.<br><br>If the people in charge of procurement feel disrespected, offended by how Mr Brown has portrayed them, then they should be more open with regards to procurement plans (within limitations of course). The problem is that people don't know how the procurement process works, and Mindef doesn't want to talk about it.  SO when signed and sealed deal like the Leopard2 purchase suddenly popped up, people don't understand and speculate lor.<br><br>From the podcast, Mr Brown probably doesn't have a clue how procurement works, and since Mindef/Govt can't be bothered to explain either, theres really no one to blame for the speculation and belief that SAF likes to buy cheapo-2nd hand equipment.  You have to admit, on the surface, that IS what it looks like.  Not everyone will delve into subject matters like this, certainly not the average singaporean, certainly not Mr Brown.<br><br>Chill out and just watch the people make a fool of themselves.  =)</div>
