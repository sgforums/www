SAF soldiers will be trained by the German Army to operate the tank in the later part of 2007.<br><br>Singapore Today Online quotes Defence Minster Teo Chee Hean as saying that the first Leopard 2A4s will enter service in about a year or a year and a half. "We looked at a number of different alternatives and the German offer of refurbished Leopard tanks is a very cost-effective option for us to start replacing some of the SM1s." Given DID's past coverage of Germany's Leopard sales, this point is hardly surprising; what might be surprising is that <strong>Singapore plans to keep its upgraded 1960s-era AMX-13s in service even after the Leopards arrive...</strong><br><br>As Defense News noted back in a March 2005 article:<br><br>"How dramatic the [German] Army's transformation really is can be seen in Structure 2010, to be adopted as of 2007.

Singapore has made updates and ongoing improvements to these vehicles something of a local specialty, running refurbishment programs in the 1980s and 1990s [see PDF for full modification details].<br><br><strong>Defense Minister Hean has stated that the SM1s will be kept in service even after the Leopards arrive</strong>. While the Leopard 2A4s will be significantly superior in many respects, including electronics and networking options as Singapore pursues its "3G" force, the SM1 has three things going for it.<br><br><strong>Numbers game</strong><br>One is that numbers can still be useful on the battlefield.<br><br><strong>already up graded</strong><br>The second consideration is that the improvements made to the SM1 have kept it in shape as a capable combatant relative to neighbouring threats.<br><br><strong>mobility</strong><br>The third consideration is that the AMX-13 SM1s' 20 tonne weight gives them mobility options that the 62 tonne Leopards can't duplicate, and make it especially useful given Singapore's environs</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by calvin2224:<br>I speculate that the Centurions are in Taiwan as part of a political deal. We obtained training space and Taiwanese assistance in exchange for parking the tanks there as part of their bulwark against mainland China. Probably with the concordance of the US too, I suspect. In the 70's, ganging up with Taiwan and USA against China was quite necessary politically. We could reap the benefits of military and political assistance without become an official member of SEATO. <strong>Perhaps the Centurions were never meant to be ours to start with, but are permanently on loan to the Taiwanese by the source country through us. Many countries do not want to be seen arming Taiwan, and Singapore is quite a useful and not to say, safe conduit that won't anger the mainland. In times of cross-straits trouble, the Taiwanese probably get access to the tanks.</strong></blockquote>One thing i am sure of is that SAF owned these tanks and the Taiwanese have no access to it (not even taking photos) in peace time. But during war time, this case may change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by equlus84:<br>I was wondering since the centurions are more or less classified stuff. Then they position 10 vehicles in Taiwan, how on earth is the Bn pratise a Bn lvl of armoured exercise or maneuver? Or was it just a pure paper and dice style of exercise? Those remaining centurions in SG, how on earth are they going to carry out exercise here without letting other noe. I mean usually u will encounter various vocation Bn having exercise at LCK, besides, there are always some civilians sneaking in there to trap wild boars and hunt for wild fruits.<br>Talking abt exercise in Taiwan, I read from one of their forums that the recent Han Kwang 19 exercise, a brigade from SG was sent there to simulate the PRC army, dun they think this is a bad idea as we also use western equipments and doctrines, thus how to sim the red army? <strong>Just like wad benefits can Taiwan get by interacting with our operators using the centurions?</strong></blockquote>Its for training purposes. As you can see ROC hardly have any military ties with the rest of the world as compared to Singapore's extensive ties. The only countries who have significant military ties with them are only US and Singapore. That been said they will most likely want to exercise with us to learn from us and to test their doctrine and capability. Of course we have things to learn from them too. For example i feel that their troops have good if not better discipline. It benefits us both.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Just like the F-15 will not phase out the F-16 and F-5E entirely.<br><br>The SM-1 will now just play only its original purpose-built role of being a Light Tank, instead of trying to be a REAL tank. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And 300 mobile 75mm gun platforms is still useful no matter what for fire support etc.<br><br>But I do suspect that the number of SM-1 will be significantly reduced over the coming years. Not only becos of wear and tear but also becos of numbers of crewmen. SAF is not suddenly going to magick more people to run so many vehicles especially with population decline.<br><br>Some SM-1 crewmen will be converted to Leos and their SM-1 likely put into storage as spares or sold to E.

I forsee the reitrement of at least 100 SM-1 as soon as the Leos become fully operational.<br><br>To begin with, whether we ever had ALL 300 SM-1's being operational at one time is still questionable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously speaking, 300-350 SM-1s is just a paper strength.  Mindef would not disclose how many of them are already beyond repair, and how many have been "thrown" into to the sea already.  I doubt foreign intelligence sources such as JDW etc would be able to estimate as well.<br><br>I say this cos I've seen quite a "few" rusting AMX-13/SM-1 derelict hulls before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually no one truly know how many AMX-13 we have in operational, just like how many Centurion or Skyhawk.<br><br>Reason is the same , remember the Skyhawk, we bought the first batch of 2nd hand refurbished a/c , but the 2nd batch was actually refurbished by us by getting a large qty of airframes, how many was refurbished and how many was slated as spares, nobody knows, that is why we see quoted from 60~ 80+.<br><br>Likewise for our AMX-13 and Centurion, nobody truly know how many hulls we have becos they were actually bought from scrapyard in the 70s and 80s.<br><br>We send some technicians and engineers over there , to inspect and chose them , some of them are refurbished and some could be used as spares.<br><br>The reported 350 AMX-13s I should say is just a estimate. Only SAF will truly know how many we have.<br><br>Just as Saneguy have many armoured Bn, likewise we also have many only slated for training in oversea, so I am sure that the number is certainly not small.</div>

That is, vehicles and equipment that are in tip top condition reserved for actual operations. And remember, our armor formations operate another crapload of M113s and BXs as well.<br><br>I'm not saying we have only 150 tanks.
