            <div class='col-md body'>I would prefer women to pack my parachutes if I had the choice... and indeed in the SAF most, if not all of the chute packers are female. Girls just pack stuff better then guys in general, and a chute is a good thing to pack well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My sectcom in SISPEC was a female instructor as well, and she wasn't any less capable with keeping up with the guys... only problem was that some of the trainees tried to get fresh with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  But I think she handled it pretty well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So ozzy_gurl, how many private messages did u receive already? I'm guessing about 6?<br><br>I know quite a few of my female friends that signed on with SAF already.  And they were quite enthu about military stuff as well.  I'm not sure if they'll become some garang siao charbors who'll charge down enemy positions with an M4 and M203, and win medals tho.  I just hope they do their job right and keep S'pore safe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whats there to post...?<br><br>The turrets blow open in even to of a hit its not exactly a safety measure.  In cases where the tank or armored vehicle is hit, and explosions occur internally(nasty nasty after armor effects), the pressure build up would find the weakest point to escape.  Hatches would be one of those weak areas that would blow first.  If pressure build up is so great that the popping hatches don't help, the whole turret might fly.  Thats not a safety measure either.<br><br>4m deep of water with 15 min preparation.  I believe its a process called fording or snorkeling.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank</a><br>Look under the section of deep fording.  There's a picture of a T-90 prepared for deep fording.  Check out the length of THAT erection.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read from another forum that the troops riding in APCs in Iraq typically keep the hatches open slightly.  So that if they were hit, the shockwave gets vented instead of trapped.</div>
