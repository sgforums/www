What he should know better is not to discuss classified matters with uncleared personnel or civilians ... whichever category you fall into.<br><br><blockquote><strong>And from what I can guess so far,I'm starting to think they must be secret,as I can not find any pictures of them,or many other ARMY vehicles.</strong></blockquote>Have a read around this forum sweetie, the standing rule is if you can't find open source proof, they don't exists.<br><br>If you insist some officers told you that and it should proof to be true, they'd be in very serious trouble.  So if I were you, I'd just quietly drop the issue and let it lie that the ADF does not operate Leo 2s.<br><br>Gundams maybe but definately not Leo 2s <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Prehaps they were really talking about the Leopard 1 all along. It makes little sense for me anyway, that the Aussies should operate two different kinds of modern MBT... unless of course they were following Malaysian arms purchase methods.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>BUT I would like to say that if it is really classified, you shouldn't be talking about it in the public domain.<br></div>
