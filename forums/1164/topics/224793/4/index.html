But as usual SAF is not satisied with what they have so decide to upgrade them, possibily to A6 standard. Therefore save both time and money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

And its refurbished making it even cheaper. Considering we already have ties with France, I half expected AMX-30s or Le Clercs.  Leopard's ok but I'd rather brand new A6 rather than refurbed A4.<br><br>I'm sure we can afford since its only 60 MBTs not 350.  They're still keeping most of the SM1s apparently.</div>

Does it mean we are still sticking to the ambush style of fight for armour?</div></blockquote>Hmm, in tank battle nowadays you at most get only one shot if both tanks are already engaging each other. An autoloader might not be as great an advantage as you think. The Fire Control System, the ability to shoot further and on the move are things that western tanks tend to do better.<br><br>Also an autoloader is a complex piece of equipment can jam and break down (and if it does jam the tank is all but useless until it is fixed). A 19-year old with a strong arm is a lot smarter, is an extra set of eyes and ears if needed, and can help pull through the gun barrel. Also in war, I suspect 19-year olds might be (to be a bit cold blooded) easier to replace then an autoloader. So it's pros and cons. They did consider using autoloading designs when making the M1 and Leo2, but rejected that for the said reasons.<br><br>The armour protection of the Leo2A4 is not superior to that of the later M1 series AFAIK, given the yanks were nutty enough to use DU in their armour when considering KE protection. But I think it's more or less up there lah. In terms of protection the two tanks are roughly equal, but I suspect the fuel efficency issue is certainly a big factor in why we chose the Leo2, if the M1 was even a consideration to begin with. The Leo2A4 fleet might also be easier to "reverse engineer" I suspect, if we ever decide to make our own upgrades.<br><br>Somebody said the Leo2a4 used space armour, I don't think this is true. All the stuff I read so far seems to indicated this is composite. A better example of a spaced armour concept would be in the Merky series of tanks.<br><br>And to correct the impression that M1s are getting pwned- the M1s are doing very well in Iraq, once you realize that the M1s actually destroyed were done in by "suck-thumb" IEDs that no MBT in the world can survive. The tanks actually soaked up a large number of IED attacks that would have totally wiped out other smaller units, and this M1 tankie actually showed pictures of post-IEDed M1s which survived the attacks. You don't want to be in any other thing in Iraq (except maybe Merky).<br><br>But anyway, great news!</div>
