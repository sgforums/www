            <div class='col-md body'>I speculate that the Centurions are in Taiwan as part of a political deal. We obtained training space and Taiwanese assistance in exchange for parking the tanks there as part of their bulwark against mainland China. Probably with the concordance of the US too, I suspect. In the 70's, ganging up with Taiwan and USA against China was quite necessary politically. We could reap the benefits of military and political assistance without become an official member of SEATO. Perhaps the Centurions were never meant to be ours to start with, but are permanently on loan to the Taiwanese by the source country through us. Many countries do not want to be seen arming Taiwan, and Singapore is quite a useful and not to say, safe conduit that won't anger the mainland. In times of cross-straits trouble, the Taiwanese probably get access to the tanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am of the opinion that the Leopards are really going to replace the AMX13-SM1 as our main armoured punch, as stated in the press. Not a quantitative replacement, but a qualitative one. We'll probably obtain a small number of additional Leopards later, upgrade the whole lot, but never approach the number of SM1 we have. Look, each Leopard requires a crew of 4 in contrast with the 3 for each SM1. In terms of manpower, we can't be fielding Leopards in the numbers we have of SM1. Logistically a small number of Leopards is just about manageable for us. These 55 ton monsters require heavy road transporters (like Osh-Goshs or Scanias <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/muv/muv_ttuc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/muv/muv_ttuc.htm</a>) and also a massive support element (ammo-supply, recovery vehicles) that we do not currently have for the SM1. We will have to buy the whole lot. Tactically, it is also a departure from light-tank operations. Roads and bridges have to be accessed to be able to handle it.<br><br>I suspect as the number of SM1 is drawn down gradually with age and attrition, a new class of wheeled AFV will make up the capability gap. This would be following the trend exhibited in the Western powers. The wheeled AFV may be something like the Stryker with AGS options. The Terrex is positioned nicely for this requirement.<br><br>Reading the lines, BMS will be fitted into the Leopards as a priority, so this whole 3G armoured force is becoming a quick reality.</div>

The 1970s was a period of thawing between US-Chinese relations with Nixon's visit in 72'. So I highly doubt that the US would be interested in creating an alliance against China. If that were the case, I think they'd be shooting themselves in the foot by recognizing China officially diplomactially. Next, the Chinese mentioned before that weren't too bother by us training in Taiwan(as stated in Defending the Lion City), I don't that would be the case if the scenario you decribed occured.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by calvin2224:</div><div class="quote_body">I am of the opinion that the Leopards are really going to replace the AMX13-SM1 as our main armoured punch, as stated in the press. Not a quantitative replacement, but a qualitative one. We'll probably obtain a small number of additional Leopards later, upgrade the whole lot, but never approach the number of SM1 we have. Look, each Leopard requires a crew of 4 in contrast with the 3 for each SM1. In terms of manpower, we can't be fielding Leopards in the numbers we have of SM1. Logistically a small number of Leopards is just about manageable for us. These 55 ton monsters require heavy road transporters (like Osh-Goshs or Scanias <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/muv/muv_ttuc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/muv/muv_ttuc.htm</a>) and also a massive support element (ammo-supply, recovery vehicles) that we do not currently have for the SM1. We will have to buy the whole lot. Tactically, it is also a departure from light-tank operations. Roads and bridges have to be accessed to be able to handle it.<br><br>I suspect as the number of SM1 is drawn down gradually with age and attrition, a new class of wheeled AFV will make up the capability gap. This would be following the trend exhibited in the Western powers. The wheeled AFV may be something like the Stryker with AGS options. The Terrex is positioned nicely for this requirement.<br><br>Reading the lines, BMS will be fitted into the Leopards as a priority, so this whole 3G armoured force is becoming a quick reality. </div></blockquote>Wrong , read this:<br><br><blockquote>....................Defense Minister Hean has stated that the SM1s will be kept in service even after the Leopards arrive. While the Leopard 2A4s will be significantly superior in many respects, including electronics and networking options as Singapore pursues its "3G" force, the SM1 has three things going for it. One is that numbers can still be useful on the battlefield. The second consideration is that the improvements made to the SM1 have kept it in shape as a capable combatant relative to neighbouring threats. The third consideration is that the AMX-13 SM1s' 20 tonne weight gives them mobility options that the 62 tonne Leopards can't duplicate, and make it especially useful given Singapore's environs.<br><br></blockquote><a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/12/asian-tiger-ordering-leopards/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/2006/12/asian-tiger-ordering-leopards/index.php</a><br><br>So even Mindef report said that some of the SM1 will be replaced  by Leo 2, Teo CH kind of give contradictory statement in the above report.<br><br>Edit for clarification.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that the Leo2 will not replace the SM-1 again, like Teo CH said, the SM-1 is special because its light.<br><br>I think this purchase of the Leo2 may not be a one off, maybe they buy 66 to test test before committing to a larger purchase number.<br><br>In anycase im sure ST is making some space armour for the front.

            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering since the centurions are more or less classified stuff.

Maybe we take turns there. Or it could be that the PLA tank corps operate on similar ABG concepts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Human or auto-loader.  I guess that would be the eventual question.<br><br>Arguably, the human is perhaps more versatile and would not fail for no reason.  The Auto-loader is (in the T-72 case) is reliable to mechanical problems and malfunctions.  Loading also takes longer.  (However Newer T-90s have demonstrated the ability to fire every 4.3 sec on the move, but of the same round type.)<br><br>However, if the auto-loader was to fail.  The vehicle would be VOR until the malfunction is repaired to be put back into service.  A human loader need only be replaced.<br><br>Personally, I am in favor of having a loader in MBTs. Being able to switch from APFSDS round to HEAT rounds without having to "cycle" the magazine is one advantage.  Being able to replace the human loader rather than having a team of mechanics work on the complex loading mechanism also appeals.</div>

It can't shoot on the move, armor's pratically a joke (even with applique), and for the same weight your typical modern LT is faster, not to mention the ground pressure. As a lot of people have pointed out, mounting a large gun on a BX would make a more capable system then the SM1, and in many roles the BX is already more capable.<br><br>I think if it really comes to it, we will trying to aquire a new LT.</div>
