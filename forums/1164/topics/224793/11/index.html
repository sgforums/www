You do bring up valid points of concern.<br><br>However, my opinion is that majority of Singaporeans (non-milnuts) don't really care to know if our "2nd hand tanks" are modern or not.  Nor do they even understand the difference between an AMX-13 SM1 light tank and a Leopard2A4 MBT.  For these people, who don't care to know, its already a bonus that they are informed that their money is used to buy military hardware regardless of their source being Mr Brown or Straits Times.<br><br>For those who naively believe that the RSAF bought 30 year old warplanes, and WW2 tanks to replace the SM1, they will realise their mistakes someday, perhaps thru an embarrassing discussion  with one of us milnuts.<br><br>If the people in charge of procurement feel disrespected, offended by how Mr Brown has portrayed them, then they should be more open with regards to procurement plans (within limitations of course). The problem is that people don't know how the procurement process works, and Mindef doesn't want to talk about it.  SO when signed and sealed deal like the Leopard2 purchase suddenly popped up, people don't understand and speculate lor.<br><br>From the podcast, Mr Brown probably doesn't have a clue how procurement works, and since Mindef/Govt can't be bothered to explain either, theres really no one to blame for the speculation and belief that SAF likes to buy cheapo-2nd hand equipment.  You have to admit, on the surface, that IS what it looks like.  Not everyone will delve into subject matters like this, certainly not the average singaporean, certainly not Mr Brown.<br><br>Chill out and just watch the people make a fool of themselves.  =)</div></blockquote>My POV, don't like, don't watch, don't see, don't listen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if all of us take a step back and compare our society to others, maybe say even China, ROC or the Phillipines. It is quite sad to say that our society just isnt mature enough.<br><br>This is not a personal attack as I totally understand the people who find mr brown's jokes offensive.<br><br>Like the example quoted about British comedy cracking jokes about their government, the people understand that the opposite is true because they are mature enough to know. If it was in Singapore, people will simply complain and start worrying about others which leads me to another question.<br>I understand we live in a Social Responsibility model of the media therefore somehow we are accustomed to think for others. While this is certainly commendable, in this scenario do they REALLY need to know that its the best tank in the world?<br><br>Even if they do accept and take it as a lousy piece of crap bought by the govt. Well they may complain, but if they were told the facts about it, they just make themselves look stupid.<br><br>its true that many ordinary citizens take it at face value on the jokes, im sure people in other democratic nations do as well. like what shotgun said, sooner or later they will find out the truth about it one way or another, we do not need to force the truth down their throats. If they want to find out, im sure they will know how to.<br><br>Its a vicious cycle if we continue to impose self-censorship, I'd say we let the people think for themselves rather than let opinion leaders think for them.<br><br>peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

They are saying that we need to survive for 3 days only - because by then , with all our  planes ,tanks and ships all in action, think there is nothing left of the other side that is left that is still worth bombing !!!</div>

Both the M1 and the Leopard 2 were born around the same time, around the same programme even.  Unfortunately, the due to some Disagreements, the Germans decided to develop the Leopard 2 tank on their own.<br><br>Perhaps, the Leo 2A4 would be roughly as capable as the M1A1 without the DU armor.  The M1A1(HA) series were better in armor protection due to the added DU Armor.  But that also increased its weight dramatically, to about 67tons!</div>
