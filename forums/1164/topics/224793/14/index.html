Also read that S.Korea has a similar M1 version which they DIY nicked "Baby Abrams" or something like that. Does the S.Korean version uses the gas turbine as well? Am quite surprised when some posted that it takes 40L to get the turbine started and at idle it consumes the same amount as when moving full speed ahead.</div></blockquote>The Leo's coax MG uses NATO 7.62mm rounds. which should be compatible to our GPMG ammo.<br><br>the German's Leo has a MG3 MG on top of the turret beside either the commander's or loader's cupploa... they don't use a 0.5' HMG.<br><br></div>

If you are talking about ground attack to destroy enemy armour, it would be silly not send it our most capable anti-armour unit to do the job. Airpower can't cover it all of the time.<br><br>Actually hor, I don't see why the Leo2 should not be used to engage enemy armour, it's just one of it's jobs and it can do it well if need be.

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, if we can have the A5 / 6, it would have been better than the A4.<br>However, the cost wud  probably have been too prohibitive for the almost 100 tanks that we intend to get.<br><br>Also I believe that with the inevitable upgrades to be made to the A4, we will get something close to A5 standard but at a very much lower cost than brand new A5/6s. Overall, we will shud finally have a sizable number of upgraded &amp; very capable Leo2s. This will still be a quantum leap from what we currently have in the form of the Tempests.<br><br>We shud always try to get  the best possible technology, but we must also weigh the cost effectiveness.  Also, one must not only look at the technology.  Equally important (  if not more ) are the men who will eventually operate our Leo2s. History always repeats itself - the man behind the machine counts for a lot more than the machine.  We shud ask what the SAF is going to do to ensure that we will have the region's most competent / skilled / motivated tankees in our Leo2s.<br><br></div>

However, the LSTs may be enlarged by ST Marine (i guess by hull section insertion method) to accomodate more MBTs. There is also talk of getting C-17 where they can also transport MBT.<br><br>All this is of course taking consideration that we have a need to deploy our MBTs overseas other than for training.
