I said earlier that we probably have training weapons already there but come to think of it, my ROC trip was so long ago I can't remember properly.<br><br>I went to ROC as part of an infantry brigade.<br><br>I do remember we only brought our own helmet, uniform, SBO and maybe ET also, plus non-weapon equipment specific to our vocation.<br><br>As I was part of the Bde S2, I remember we were responsible for obtaining thousands of ROC maps for the entire brigade from the Taiwanese authorities.<br><br>Now ROC maps are considered extremely sensitve material due to the state of war between ROC and PRC. Inevitably, many copies of maps were lost by the end of excercise and out S2 WO got hell for it from the Taiwanese authorities.<br><br>But most of all, I remember the atrocious concentration camp-style of the Taiwanese barracks.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed that MBT for offence and ATGM for defence.<br><br>I am saying we shud have  a lot more ATGMs for all battalions for the  counter MBT role. Since the latest gen of ATGMs so effective against MBTs, we need not depend on our own MBTs to defend / fight against enemy MBTs if we have more ATGMs.<br><br></div>

Doing the math we can see why it may not be so cool to shoot our ATGMs at everything.</div>

But these systems suffer from a lot of issues and limitations, and come to think of it... if you are going to use it to pop a bunker or annoy a tank... why not just use an 84 which far more flexible? If the low cost was really so attractive and useful, we would be totting Saggers nows.<br><br>The newer (and more useful) russian ATGMs don't come cheap at all. In the end a shell is still cheaper, esp. when you are engaging targets that don't really move and have a clear LOS to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Australian Defence Force(ADF) ARE using the Leo2's.....they train with them in two of our training grounds,Laverick Barracks in Townsville,Queensland, and Kapooka Recruitment and Training Barracks in Wagga Wagga,New South Wales.<br><br>They are also transported to, and used in training at Shoalwater Bay Training Area,on ADF exercises.<br><br>As for what will happen to the SAF's unused tanks,there is already talk at work that they are to be sent here for Exercise Wallaby 07.Which may I add,is going to be the biggest exercise ever,seeing as an Urban Warfare Cantre is in the process of being built,aswell as major upgrades,such as Camp Growl being extended to be 3 times the size of Sam Hill.<br><br>We already have possession of a number of tanks and other vehicles year round,in between exercises,they are stored at our work base by the SAF.</div>
