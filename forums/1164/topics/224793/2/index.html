            <div class='col-md body'>Some history..from Wikipedia..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>On 11 December 1974 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the USA for the possible joint production of a new MBT, after the Americans had bought and investigated prototype hull number seven in 1973. In view of the experiences in the Yom Kippur War a much higher level of protection was demanded than was implemented in the prototypes, that used heavily sloped spaced armour. The weight class was increased to sixty tons.</strong> Prototype turret number fourteen was changed to test a new armour configuration, and was turned into a blockier looking turret as a result of using vertical steel perforated armour; it already had been much more voluminous than the turret of a Leopard 1 because of a large internal ammunition storage locker in the rear.<br><br>The Leopard 2 thus initially used perforated armour but not Chobham armour as often claimed. PT-14 used the 120 mm Rheinmetall gun (as eventually did the U.S. Abrams). After this two new prototype hulls and three turrets were ordered, one (PT-20) mounting the original L7A3 105 mm gun and a Hughes fire control system, a second (PT-19) with the same fire control system but able to "swap out" the gun for the 120 mm Rheinmetall design (it was indeed so changed by the Americans), and one more (PT-21) mounting the Hughes-Krupp Atlas Elektronik EMES 13 fire control system, with the 120 mm gun.<br><br>In the summer of 1976 prototype 19 was assembled and shipped to the USA, together with hull number twenty and a special target vehicle to test the armour. The prototype was called Leopard 2AV (Austere Version) because it had a simplified fire control system. It arrived in the US by the end of August 1976, and comparative tests between the Leopard 2 and the XM1 (the prototype name for the M1 Abrams) prototypes were held from 1 September at Aberdeen Proving Ground, lasting until December 1976.<br><br>The US Army reported that the Leopard 2 and the XM1 were comparable in firepower and mobility, but the XM1 was superior in armor protection. Today we know this was only true as regards a hit by a hollow charge; <strong>against KE-attack the Leopard 2 was almost twice as well protected as the original M1 (650 mm to 350 mm). </strong>The difference with a shaped charge is also negligible. Its more traditional multifuel diesel engine was also much more reliable, and provided the same performance. Hull twenty was fitted with simulation weights, which transpired to equal only the weight of a turret without armour modules fitted, devalidating all performance data.<br><br>After the comparative test the Leopard 2 hulls were returned to Germany for further evaluation, but turret 19 remained and was fitted to the hull of prototype seven, while its gun was changed for the 120 mm Rheinmetall. In tests until March 1977 it was found to be far superior to the 105 mm M7 mounted on the Abrams, which was confirmed by subsequent NATO tank gunnery contests</span></div>
