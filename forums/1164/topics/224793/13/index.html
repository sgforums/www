It was designed with a distinctive low-slung turret with boxy, vertical sides and a long overhanging bustle.

It can thus be launched from a 105 mm gun or from a 120 mm gun using a sabot. <strong>As a tank-launched weapon, Lahat gives MBTs an important new capability, enabling first-shot kills of armoured targets at ranges over 6 km using internal or external designation.</strong><br><br>It also provides new capabilities in challenging scenarios such as combat in open areas as well as in as urban warfare, using indirect firing with external designation.<br><br>The missile system passed a successful live-fire demonstration in Meppen, Germany, last year. <strong>During the demonstration the Lahat missiles were launched from the gun of a Leopard 2-A4 tank</strong>. One missile was fired against a stationary tank; the second missile was fired against a moving tank driven by remote control. Both targets were located about 4 km from the launching tank, and both missiles scored direct hits, within 30 cm from the centre of the laser designation spot.</blockquote><a href="http://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/index.php?fid=3902&amp;lang=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/index.php?fid=3902&amp;lang=3</a><br><br>Our future Leopards may be able to fire the Lahat missiles just like the Merkavas!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont forget that these Leopards are already more than 20 years old. They will still need extensive &amp; expensive upgrading to keep them up to par with modern MBTs. As they are now, they are at least one generation behind the M1A1/2 &amp; Leopard 2 A5/6. However, they are at least one and the half generations ahead of upgraded Centurions.</div>

But the Leopard 2 A5/6 is at least on par with M1A1. However, the gas turbine in teh M1A1 is a pain as it needs lots of expensive clean jet fuel. Leopards use MTU diesel  engines and the Germans build great diesels.<br></div></blockquote>Erm actually the M1 turbine is the ultimate in multifuel engines, an Abrams tankee did say that the tank can run anything from jet fuel, to diesel and even Jim Bean if needed. For the record the M1 is typically run on diesel, and not jet fuel.<br><br>The upkeep for a turbine is also less then that of a comparative diesel, it contains less moving parts, is very much smaller and lighter, and is in general more reliable and easier to repair and replace then a diesel. Turbines provide so many advantages for MBT use that there was a moment in tank design where people were assuming that it was going to be the standard for future tank designs.<br><br>Of course it wasn't the case. The main (and most serious) drawback of running turbines is the fuel consumption. Turbines buring nearly as much fuel idling as they do at full throttle, and it seems to be the reason why the yanks are the only ones who have the case and ability to seriously field an turbine MBT. On the flipside, the turbine engine becomes the most efficent engine when the tank is being run at full speed, far more so then any diesel can ever match... but you don't really get a lot of chances to do that in a city.<br><br>Germans make fantastic diesels though!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although turbines are multifuel, I do not think they run well with diesel - fuel consumption will be higher  and  maintenance will also be higher. Aviation fuel will mostly be used and that adds another complication to logistics. Turbines are lighter for same power output, but then tank needs to carry more fuel because of the high fuel consumption &amp; this negates the saving in weight.<br><br>Also, all your other vehicles from Land Rovers to Bionix to 5 tonners etc all run on diesel. Also, for maintenance ,  mechanics are  already familiar with diesel engines. Recovery &amp; other specialized vehicles based on tank chassis are more well suited to diesel engines. Yes, Germans make good diesels - around 50 % of all new cars sold in Germany are diesels and our Navy uses mainly MTU diesels.<br><br>The Americans are the only ones who can afford to have gas turbines on their M1A1/2s. Gas turbines are great if you can afford the extra cost of expensive fuel and extra logistics.<br><br>In the long term ,I think we will have a MBT ( Leopard 2 or other ) , LT ( ST designed ) and Bionix configuration for SAF armor.<br><br></div>

In a pip we could use normal diesel for tank turbines if it came to it.<br><br>And saying that it's a real hassle to learn how to upkeep a turbine for our forces used to diesel is pretty moot. I'm sure we have plenty of experience running turbines given we use helicopters, and logistically this moots the point that it's really going to be a logistical issue. It's like saying we should mount a 75mm gun on our Leo2 and try to keep with that caliber for all our future armored systems to ease logistical issues.<br><br>In pratice a turbine is more reliable and easier to keep going then a diesel. A tank with a broken turbine will be back in action a lot quicker and will put a lot more miles before it messes up again. The REAL reason why we will never consider the design is the fuel efficency of it, which is a big issue for us (and for most other armies that don't have cash like the Yanks)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just curious, does having Leo 2 mean that we will have to expand our inventory to incl. 120mm ammo? Also the 7.62 cal co-axial MG and the .50cal. MG on the tanks, are they going to be refitted to the FN MAG GPMG and CIS.50 which is currently in service or remain as the original?<br><br>Also what is the difference between the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams? Also read that S.Korea has a similar M1 version which they DIY nicked "Baby Abrams" or something like that. Does the S.Korean version uses the gas turbine as well? Am quite surprised when some posted that it takes 40L to get the turbine started and at idle it consumes the same amount as when moving full speed ahead.</div>
