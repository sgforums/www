            <div class='col-md body'>Well, nationalistic fevor from both sides means that we would end up trying to downplay or belittle each other whenever something like this happens. If you can get Pakistanis arguing why their local tank is the best tank in the world (better then the M1 as well) it's no surprise that some Malaysians would be concerned about downplaying the Cat. When the SAR-21 came out, it was by all respects a decent weapon but we got plenty of Malaysian folks who made it a point to try to highlight why it HAD to be inferior to the Aug... for many varied and equally invalid reasons that ended up quite funny. I mean quality aside (of which I hardly think the SAR is inferior), it's really marksmanship and tatics that make a weapon effective. I'm not too surprised if their army got the Cat, they would be rushing to praise it. But lets be sensible about this and see the facts yah?<br><br>Force for force the SAF will have want to equip a superior weapon system to what the Malaysians might field because in the long run if there's really a race we cannot maintain an advantage in numbers, hence piecemeal we need better equipment. AFAIK, the Cat is not a clumsly tank... not any more then the M1 could be considered clumsly when it outgunned and outmanuvered T-72s (on which guess what tank is based on?) in both Gulf Wars. Crew training is far more important. I believe the Israelis, who are an avid user to "big and clumsly" western tanks in all their conflicts ended up making the merky, and have a good reason not going T-72.<br><br>In all fairness, the PT-91 can't be as bad as Saddam's ten camels per MBT T-72s that got pwned in a closed range melee with M1A2 SEPs during Gulf War 2, but as one says, to gain the advantages it has over western tanks like smaller profile it gives up a lot of issues. If you are in a war, you certainly do not want to go into it in a soviet tank, unless it's the Black Eagle or something.<br><br>I don't see the big concern about the Leo's frontal armour, it is still sloped wat, though the "cheeks" that the A5 and A6 versions have would be good. ST will certainly fiddle about it with, and the first batch of Cats we are getting are also probably for "testing, testing" reasons. Said and done, I think this Cat purchase is something we can be happy about.<br><br><blockquote><br>Actually i seriously do suspect that they already have the T-80s. Reason being that their Deftech are already technology partners with the Ukrainians. </blockquote>I did see one picture of a malaysia T80U undergoing runs in a oil palm plantation some time back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I don't care if we just use the Leopard for NDP.. We have the money, we should have had MBT to show off long, long ago.<br><br>Anyway, MBT definitely do not replace Light Tanks. Every major nation that operates MBT do not discard their Light Tanks. They simply do different jobs.<br><br>My gripe has always been that we have only Light Tanks and no MBTs. Light Tanks have small guns and can be knocked out as easily as our other APC and IFV by infantry AT weapons.<br><br>At least MBT armour protection might stand some chance. Now with MBT at least our armour organisation is complete.<br><br>I personally do not think that our AMX-13 might necessarily be retired. 66 MBT is no replacement for 300 Light Tanks. I'm sure give a few more years and there will be only 100 of them still operable, given their age. But I think they will be continue serving with the MBT until we buy or build a new Light Tank.<br><br>Neither do I think that our Centurions will necessarily be replaced by the Leopards. If we have enough crew we may still operate both types.<br><br>We have about 70 each of the Leopards and Centurions. These are pretty small numbers.<br><br>During the major wars fought in the Middle East, one side can have 70 tanks out of action in ONE day (though some maybe can be repaired later). Especially in Yom Kippur, a lot of these were infantry-inflicted damage. Tank on tank, the IDF always won.<br><br>With side reference to attack choppers: In many situations, they still have to expose themselves to ground fire to get a good shot.</div>

But never quite heard anything about them being absorbed into service.  The T-80 and T-84 series of tanks are really much more capable than the PT-91s by far.  However, IIRC, they are also wider.</div>
