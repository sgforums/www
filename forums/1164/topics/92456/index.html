            <div class='col-md body'>FYI, JDF is to change its military role soon to include a combat role in-order for Japan to remaind as a member of the U.N security council.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>If your game is base on the actual capabilities of both armed forces, then S'pore is likely to win but with heavy lost.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Reason for this is that JDF to date has not really upgrade or spent on arming its forces in-order to remaind as a non-aggressive military force.  However, this does not mean that the JDF soldiers can't fight.  Instead, I believe that they'll be more aggressive &amp; better organize then SAF.  This is due to the fact that being Japanese, JDF soldiers still have a mentality of following orders &amp; they still believe &amp; follow the teaching of the ways of the warrior.  It also helps that JDF soldiers are regular soldiers as compared to SAF soldiers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

As of now, China still lacks the capability to stand up to a straight fight with Japan. In a decade or maybe even lesser, China WOULD be the strongest in Asia but not right now. Despite the improvements that have been made to China's military, they are still not evenly spread out. Taking the PLAN as an example, the Chinese have invested in puchasing Sovremenny class destroyers from Soviet Union but there are only 4 of them and their remaining fleet assets consist of Luhai and Luhu class destroyers that are still unable to challange the technologically superior Japanese MSDF. That is if we don't even factor in the MSDF light aircraft carriers, which are able to support Harrier style jets.<br><br>That being said, the JSDF does have its weaknesses like a lack of air-refuelling capability, standoff weapons but they still hold all the advantages in a standoff vs the PLA. Furthermore, their troops are better trained in the rigours of modern warfare, with their constant exercise against the Americans. But whether that will hold true in the future has yet to be seen...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh! Point from Bot_in_shop noted, however, China's war strat has never really forcus on its Naval power.  PDF recently did admit their weakness in reclaiming Taiwan is its lack of naval power.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Rather China has always forcus its strength on its human power.  Remenber the PDF did help N.korea to kick the U.S butt in the Korean war, then help the Viet-cong to kick the U.S butt again in the Vietnam war.  In any case, ever wonder why the U.S never, ever, contemplate on going to war with China to wipe out communits?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Back to the point, WW II, Japan was never able to subdue China totally even when Jap was far superior, organize &amp; damn bloody brutal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for Japan war games with U.S, Ooh please!
