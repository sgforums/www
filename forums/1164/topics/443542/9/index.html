              <p> what do u know about rockets and engineering?:)there are many types of rockets.go read up on how  they function instead of tellin me names of someones weapons that are on sale instead.but that miht prove difficult for u as u might only know how to point and shoot.im not  impressed about u bein able to rough it out or shoot straight or have battlefield expertise in a real combat as u arent a professiona sign on commando or ndu etc etc.so there u have it.</p>
              <p>rather u are some parrot who echoes info made from engineers and the companies selling them</p>
              <p>if u have clearance,then it should be easy for u to find out then unless u need to be spoon fed once aain by people for info on uncommon equipment from xray goggles,firestorm to a rocket.</p>

              <p>korean war is on.south korean ns is only 1 year 9 months in the army.reservist as told to me by korea engineer who was holidaying here in oz for 1 year is only 7 days in a year.or was that 4 days in a year high key n low key.death toll in south korean war till to date is 400,000 deaths .</p>

              <p>singapore had how many war casualties to deserve a 2 year ns?10,000?1000?100?1?even north korea has 1 year 9 mths in army wvwn after the korean war n present problems.</p>
              <p>the israelis after the holaucaust  in europe with millions of jews dead in ww2 is still in shock after it all.</p>
              <p>sinapore got an equivalent korean war??holaucaust??what has it got to warrant such a lengthy ns??even if u gave the entire spore population weapons to defend against the neighbours of a bigger population. its still the same result as when u give ns men 4 mths of training.</p>
              <p>the $$$$$ wasted on ns conscripts is best sent elsewhere to a regular sign on force who would excel in combat and the military and upgrades and developement  of new military systems</p>

              One again, Bullshitman shows that his posts are all bile, insults, insinuation and no real information of value. Something like the person in question.
                  
              The "WWII super rocket system people made into Metal Storm" bullshit is talking about the Kathyusha truck mounted rocket system. Also called Stalin's Organs from their pipe organ whistling sound when fired. They got the fire density by firing off racks of single mounted rockets. Metal Storm on the other hand, stacks rounds on top of each other and fires them electrically. Both totally different systems.
                  
              Shitman, I've given a lot of technical information on this site, as opposed to you who have given no technical information at all. What do I know about rockets? I studied them. What do YOU know about rockets, RPV, LCS, Imagers? From your posts, I can safely say, not much. Leave the technical and military stuff to those qualified to think about them, don't want to burn out the vacuum tube you have for a brain. And before you go "bwahahaha I'm better at tech than yoÃ¼." I'll safely say 1) You don't show it, 2) I doubt it, and 3) I'M the superior of the two of us when it comes to mil tech as I have already proven.
                  
              Don't smiley face your posts, you insult others and expect to laugh it off? Life doesn't work that way. I'll find some way to pay you back for all the "kind" treatment you've been dishing out. Only just and fair.

Your regulars only army don't need more ships and aircraft, they don't have the numbers to need them, unless you want one plane per person.
              
              Go comment on something that really involves you, you're no longer in NS or in Singapore, you can afford to give bullshit suggestions, those of us still here need more practical inprovements, not movie weapons.

              <p>what insults and insinuations?the only one u ever had was from  the army!im begining to think u need mental help even over a small debate such as these.there are prisons or mental hospitals for people like u in the civilised world.</p>
              <p>u threatening me with your lack of schooling here?where were u trained in rockets?the school of coolies and squatters??hahaha.....u stupid inderpad..just because u read stuff that a kid from the usa reads doesnt make u qualified to be a rocketman!wow....this is my foist time i have met a medical doctor who presrcibed wrong dosage as 2 panadols in 8hrs when 2 manufacturers say 2 panadols in 6 hrs!u are no engineer or rocket technician so lay off as u cant even use a multimeter properly even to measure rocket compeonents.just be a jarhead will u n leave the techno side alone to REAL ENGINEERS who really studied and calculated them!have u calculated the rockets?any kid can study a rocket book  with pictures while shiiting in the toilet!!</p>
              <p>think i have seen enough to safely say u are not sane even.</p>
              <p>i wont be smiling at u...in fact i wonder if i should report u to mindef as one of their people isnt in right frame of mind and if he should be sent to a medical examination or to another unit with no combat involved.</p>

              WOW!! Hitman's drooling while posting! His brain fried!.. oh wait, that can't be right, he doesn't have one...
                          
              And no, my LTC don't salute me, all he said was "the other forces will be stuck getting past the water body, so you guys are it, we'll heli-insert you guys and call in airstrikes".
                          
              Have to admit, it was fun co-ordinating 4 F-16s. What did the general salute you for? Or is it the whole unit? Other people did the work while you went to hide in the canteen right?
                          
              And I'm not like you to read books by US kids, my textbook was one that had things like fuel energy/mass ratio, impulse temperature and toxicity (hydrazine and TEB anyone? ) I did say I was a genius, and my interests vary, medical is only one of my fields of study.
                          
              And the package you're reading from of panadol uses European body mass, faster clearence of drug. Don't try to give medical advice you're not qualified to, and especially don't question a professional when all you are is a parrot who reads off boxes and pass it off as medical advice without even knowing the basics. Try not to kill anyone with your stupidity.
                      
              "in fact u made many errors in here from firestorm not being part of metal storm"
                      
              What "firestorm"? There is no Metalstorm project by that identifier, you just simply don't know what you're talking about. Metal Storm is the weapon name AND the company name, hard to get that wrong, but still you managed it.
                      
              Hand-held X-ray and helmet mounted ARE science fiction, the one on that article you were pedelling is a TECH DEMONSTRATOR, i.e even less than a prototype not to mention you want us to trust people like you with radioactive material used to generate x-rays in the 1st place? I'm betting your unit will all get cancer within 10 years, the way you listen or comprehend.
                      
              And YOU were the one who said Metal Storm was just a scaled down Katyusha rocket system.
                  
              "............metal storm is but an old scaled down models if rockets in ww2."
                      
              Memory failure? Or you climb the corporate ladder by bad mouthing your co-workers, explaining away your mistakes and claiming their work as yours don't you?
              
              "theres no war in spore and never had any.so cool it!thats an order!"

              <p>And the package you’re reading from of panadol uses European body mass, faster clearence of drug.

              <p>they stated 2 panadols in 6hrs on boxes!the hospital i went to gave 2 panadols in 6hrs yet u gave someone dosage  of 2 panadols in 8hrs!</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Well, imho, Taiwan should just scrap its NS. 4 months is just simply not sufficient to train an effective conscript army. In fact, I still strongly support our 2 year NS. Maybe it would even be better if it were alittle longer.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">After reading through all the posts, I do feel that our NS has certain flaws. The most pressing is that those who did not serve in combat vocations may not truely understand why 2 years of NS is required.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I am from a combat vocation, one that lacks the glory of CDO or Guards, but I understand my importance and the role I play. I know I am not cannon fodder as many of you like to term it as. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Starting with BMT. BMT, honestly is NOT where boys turn into men. Its where boys learn to adjust and come to terms with what is to come in the next 2 years. Here, 90% of the time is spent on PT, with one goal in mind, to pass their IPPT and introduce SOC. Where fat or soft boys gain some muscle and physical endurance to proceed with further training. The 5 day field camp and sit test is just introductory. Honestly, I'd be afraid to place Singapore's hopes in these boys, they've just only learnt to protect themselves.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think its because of BMT that many of our boys (mostly non-combat) do not understand the rational for the 2 years. Especially PES C and below who are usually posted to become clerks and logistic personell, who are very important, but are usually thrown into mundane office drudgery right after their basic training. I am not implying that all clerks do not understand the need of 2 years. Just that if its the case, I'd like to explain why from a combat vocation point of view and what was missing out from the NS experience. Although I've also heard and come to respect several of my PES C friends contributions in their NS too, cool higher tech stuff than I did.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Thing is, if you asked any combat guy, infantry, guards, cbt engineers... Was their NS slack for the first say, 15 months? I doubt any of their ans will be yes. BMT is chalet compared to what ever that comes next. In BMT a normal private who passes out will have the skills to defend himself, and only himself. In the many months to come, from where I came from, we were taught to work as a section and then platoon, to gain that immense bond and teamwork, then came company level training and finally to the battalion level. I can assure you that these intense training cannot be taught in 4 months. The number of field camps is just blinding and I wasn't even from a prestigious unit. Who care if you could operate a rifle, or saw, whats really important is platoon and coy level training, where a group of young men train to be efficient soldiers by working together. I'm sure many Singaporeans who served will agree with me on this.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Maybe people who do special missions are of a different breed where they are train to go solo. Whereby they can wrestle a european in a knifefight which ends by slowly melting a knife into the enemy's chest. Well for me as one of the more common fighting citizen soldier of singapore, I can say a single soldier who has broke contact with his section or platoon is more or less a gonner. I am no one without my platoon and section. But I believe together with them, we can and will defend Singapore successfully. And thus I truely believe 2 years should and must stay to ensure that the soldier has the necessary skills to work effectively as a fighting force. Time used to teach, train and test them and finally field them as op ready men. Not as weak individuals but as strong and steadfast teams of Singaporean men. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I guess this is what most clerical staff may be missing out on. I have to admit, going through the field camps was... horrible to say the least. But at least you weren't doing it alone. But I guess, its only though the rigourous and unrelenting training that we will understand that proper soldiers do not get trained overnight or 4 months. Because, honestly, it ain't easy being one.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">And as for regulars. Well, lets be fair. Certain units require regulars, but certainly reservists have done well in the past too. Israle for one has shown that with sufficient training, a citizen force can be more potent than a regular one. As from my personal experience, regulars didn't look like rambo, nor were they very powderful killing machines. Most would look just like your friendly uncle at your hdb kopitiam on a sunday morning. Baring certain elite regular-only units, most other regulars are there to pass on knowledge and experience to ensure smooth operation of the SAF as the main staple of the force- the NSFs are rotated through their traing regimes year after year. Having a fully regular force is expensive and does not mean a better force. So why not employ regulars in key positions while the mainstay be comprised of the citizen force? What we are doing now. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">And please, droids. Gosh. Lets talk about droids when the first one manages to scale mount everest on its own power. Nothing replaces boots on the ground becase we can hold the ground anywhere in any terrain under bad weather, all weather. Something my encik said that I will never forget.</p>
