              <p><br>u have $$$$$$ and can buy any weapon???thats what the japanese and german said in ww2 !they even had slave labour to make weapons.they had trainings too.they still lost.its how practical they intend to think and have effective use of what they are given is all that matters in a war.since your technology in war is par with rest of countries and really dont see much difference..its not like they are using spears  but have the same weapon that shoots same amount of rounds per minute as what any rifle is able to do.thats where u nshouldnt depend on your common weapon with technology not much diffeerrnt to that 30 years ago.</p>
              <p>no one in ns has ever failed to run or pass bmt in 3  or 4 mths.if 90% pass still ok!how many u know failed bmt and never passed out in 3 or 4 mths?</p>
              <p>the other remaining time being sent to units could simply be a waste of time.</p>
              <p>the american army pays full time soldiers from all races and use technologies for their soldiers to prevent soldiers from getting killed and in wheelchairs.</p>
              <p>the $$$$ would be well invested to prevent casualties ,get more professional career soldiers as regulars and improve firepower.</p>

              Hah, who said? The Germany and Japan in Hitman's fantasy world? No one I remember of note in the war said anything like that. I call bullshit. Hitman using the sgforums as a toilet again.
                      
              And you think Middle ages ah? You and Ang Mo go arm wrestle to see who wins? Nowadays, they use guns, 5.56 don't care if you Ang Mo, Or Mo, or Che Mo, one hit is all it takes. Hitman still thinking more muscles = better bullet.
                  
              "no one in ns has ever failed to run or pass bmt in 3  or 4 mths.if 90% pass still ok!how many u know failed bmt and never passed out in 3 or 4 mths?"
                  
              3 I know, but then, my time standards were probably stricter. Obviously if they let Hitman pass... 
                  
              For those curious, you recourse in the next batch, though one 1st Sgt I knew recoursed a year later, regular, had other training he had to take 1st.
              
              sg, I totally agree with you. Throw a Skyblade's controls to Hitman, and he'll probably try to use it as a club, you need to train to be able to use weapons effectively, what BullsHitman really wants is to bitch about NS and skive. Our stuff really isn't that far from top end high tech, in some cases even exceeds US equipment, but all the tools in the world won't help without proper training, which needs more than a cheap 4 months.

              <p>Exactly. It's either teach the shit in BMT or teach after. My beef is even though BMT was shortened one week, it has been turned into a hollow shell. The 9 weeks are almost wasted and can be better spent learning something useful.</p>

              Hell, even in reservist, we're still learning new stuff, I only got to call in airstrike, use unmanned ground sensors, in my 5th high key. Can you imagine how much more we have to learn in reservist if they didn't fit it into the 2.5 years?

Can you imagine how much more we have to learn in reservist if they didn't fit it into the 2.5 years?</p>

              <p>Exactly. It's either teach the shit in BMT or teach after. My
              beef is even though BMT was shortened one week, it has been turned
              into a hollow shell. The 9 weeks are almost wasted and can be
              better spent learning something useful.</p>
              <p>I would refer to teach it in BMT so every soldier has it.</p>

              <p>BMT is for *basic* military training, for guys to learn which end of the rifle is the more dangerous end, to learn how not to shoot themselves in the face/foot. There are other things BMT teaches, but that's probably the most important.</p>
              <p>That IMO, one of the real values of NS as a deterrent force. Any potential occupier better be prepared to enter a country where every (well, almost) Singaporean male over the age of 18 can aim in the correct direction and shoot a rifle/pistol. Whether they'll actually hit anything is secondary. Because having so many men trained is enough to give occupiers pause. Anyone on the street is a potential threat.</p>
              <p>Having said that, BMT is 9 weeks now? What did they take out?</p>

              With a lot of luck, Hitman.
                  
              And I totally agree with meander, the skill of the soldier is almost irrevelant considering that the terrain in Singapore is so closed, just firing a mag down an enemy filled corridor is almost sure to hit something. It's also why our PDFs use shotguns.
                  
              In forrested areas though, training starts to show, so allocation of forces would probably be more like BMTs and PDFs for home defence while the NSF and NSmen push into enemy territory.

              As opposed to you being classified as a liability at 18, and not only to NS.

              <p>PDF uses shotguns? I thought those guys are issued any old weapons available, I hardly think specialized weapons are bought for them. (M-16s- the rare occasion when this is a good thing). About 3 years back saw this Local Security Company concept in an issue of Army News. They gather some surplus guys from reservist battalions together in a company and train them during ICT. PDF is the HQ responsible for POI, this sounds like the kind of forces available to them in war.</p>
              <p>First I've heard about the shotgun- what model are they issued?</p>
