Benefiting from improved ties with mainland China, the island's young men will have to spend shorter time in uniform beginning from early 2015, after parliament passed an amendment to the conscription law late on Tuesday, it said. 'We are gradually introducing a professional military, so there will be no holes in our defence capabilities,' said David Lo, the defence ministry's spokesman. The ministry plans to eventually maintain a permanent professional military of 215,000 soldiers, down from 275,000 conscripted and professional soldiers at present, he said. Please enab...</span></p>

              <p>Its a strange topic. Why should Taiwan mind being part of China? A decade ago, Taiwan still thought they were entitled to rule the whole of China.

              <p>Without NS, the Taiwanese can still maintain 215,000 soldiers. More important is that they have sufficient professionals for a deterrant air force and navy (as the PLA still needs to cross the straits of Taiwan &gt;100km).</p>
              <p>If no NS, how many professional soldiers in Singapore? 5,000? 20,000? Can the airforce/navy alone prevent an aggressor crossing 1-2km of causeway/2nd link? Has never happened in history. Didn't happen in WW2 with 85,000 soldiers defending Singapore. Some people need to think. </p>

              <p>only countries that have more than 1 year ns but not more than 1.5 years would be countries that are technically still at war with neighbours as in israel and south korea.they were proven with battles ,reports,casualties of deaths of thousands of army and civilians on all sides.</p>
              <p>but spore does not deserve the 2 years ns implemented it doesnt even need a 1 year ns even!!....it makes me wonder if the politicians in charge of military matters are.................in a state of psychosis or hypochondriacness or are simply taking advantage of peoples generosity to do ns.until they have a aggression by the neighbours perhaps only then should u recall all the reservists...but 2 years of wasting time is too much.</p>

              <p><br>all countries are defencing against foreign n domestic enemies!only country giving out lengthy ns would be countries that were recently attacked by entire battalions of soldiers nd witnessed by the UN. that country is israel and was attacked at the same time by syria,iran,egyptian,pakistan and almost all of the arab world.a deal had to be brokered by usda and the then ussr along with the UN.theirs is a proven threat and i dont really condone the israeli national service as they are surrounded by real nasty arab neighbours who sent thousand of troops to gaza and killed thosands of israeli troops.that was proven in  history and the UN with photographs,battle reports of yom kippur wars etc etc.</p>
              <p>what has singapore proven to have a lengthy ns???did the UN brokered a deal with the enemies of spore?what army is attacking or attacked spore in the past n present?</p>
              <p>for domestic affairs ,u do not need to call up kid soldiers with 2 years of ns.spore need regular soldiers or real policeman for that job.u already have gurkhas.</p>

              <p><br>japan  is different.the imperial army was totally destroyed.only left the toothless soldiers</p>
              <p>in israel and korea..all the enemies nd old soldiers are still around sharpening their axes.</p>
              <p>the logic of keeping an army ns system is base on ones intelligence.its like ww2...do u still see any soldiers carrying the rocket bazzoka or mp40s home and waiting foir the enemy due to weapons being sanctioned as the right to protect ones freedom?no!!the weapons are removed from troops once war is over.</p>
              <p>same as ns....why u need such lengthy ns when theres no war ?4 months is enought to train one on weapons along with bmt stuff.....why u need another 1 year 8 months more??because u flipped a coin and it said 1 year 8 moinths??all these has a logic n accountbility,,,not because i think maybe i need more time with ns for conscrpits etc etc....which is exactlky a cheaper,faster n better solution than really paying for a regular army.</p>
              <p>i would say some politician is using ns as a cheapskate way to protect country.</p>
