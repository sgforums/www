              I'm not an engineer, just a genius.
              
              You, on the other hand, have yet to master punctuation and capital letters.
              
              You're really 6 years old right?
              
              I'd LOVE to tell you about my NS, it was extremely fun, unfortunately, a lot of it's sensitive info, but I can tell you 2 things indirectly.
              
              1) My encik wears the eagle and trident. That should tell you what kind of unit we are.
              
              2) I deployed from ALL the Army insertion helos before, i.e UH-1H, Puma, CH-47
              
              You talk about your imaginary crap "secret mission". When it comes to the real thing, they look for us.
              
              In your face, loser.

              <p>a salute from u is like getting a salute from a 5 year old toothless kid in shorts and a pail on his head and marching trying hard to be a soldier.</p>
              <p>if u are a genius....what kind of things have u made for the world???death star?gundams?vibrators?canned food?</p>
              <p>why do u need to tell me about your ns?no one here asked for it.besides that i dont think u have any balls to tell anyone for fear of being caned or something.</p>
              <p>your encik is your encik,,he is a professional regular soldier.u are not!theres plenty of difference here between YOU AND HIM.Understand that u and him cant be the same  person even if u tried stealing away his uniform and wearing it and feeling shiok about it!what a disturbing person u are....and what has your encik even if he had a spetsnaz cap badge got to do with u?are u his twin ??hahaha......why is it u people are always telling his uncle and grabdfather is so and so while the speaker is never the person who is illustrious as the person he potraits..just because yoiur encik sausage is 16 inches doesnt mean yours is 16 inches too!!!!u make me think u are some pet poodle of some army encik even....damn hillarious!!!hahahaha</p>
              <p>u got off from helios....so did i... and more  even as compared to yours!!yours is small potatos!u sound like a kid describing his first exposure to a porn dvd.no big deal really.</p>
              <p>well...i never saw anyone from your unit in any secret mission which was dangerous.u sure u arent imagining things?my secret mission file is in mindef archive.  are your real missions in mindef too?do u even have one with the exception of your encik who is a regular soldier!?</p>
              <p>i guess not as u sound awfully pissed in here..if u had went for real missions in  real emergencies to do a mission in 10 hrs or so..u wouldnt be here bitching and calling names like a bitch in heat.</p>
              <p>u showed your weakness woman!they must breed plenty of losers and bitch in heat from your unit as it appears.maybe i should forward this to mindef and see if they are producing men or wimen from your unit!</p>
              <p>if im a loser then u are much much worse....queen of losers i should say!hahaha</p>

              <p>Check with mindef.And your credibility is of no concern to me or anyone here.i have learnt enough from u in sgforum shoutbox as u are not mentally hardened to military standards.<br>u need not know further details as u are deemed as not becoming in keeping your emotions and humanity intact at mediocre levels of stress.</p>
              <p>Had the enemy captured you and tortured you, you would have given them every single bit of information in you along with the details of your pet dogs at home.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the military was never your true birth calling but you were forced into it unwillingly.hence my proposed suggestion to call for an even shorter conscription level and for more recruitment of regular forces to take over the positions which need more time in training.its not meant to hurt you in any way whatsoever.</p>
