              <p>Hitman, I'd just like to know which part of you NS experience made you such an anti-NS person. I know sometimes the things we do in NS can be quite silly and stupid. But when you think back, you must have done all these stupid things with some very close buddies ain't it? Didn't those times matter? Wasn't it memorable? Fun and even enjoyable at times?</p>
              <p>Well, honestly, if I met a BG or even my CO, a Col, when I salute him. He is obliged to salute back. So.. I don't think its very significant right? Just some military manners.</p>
              <p>As for x-ray vision and firestorm. Haven't seen them in use with the SAF with my own eyes. Only used image intensifiers in my unit, ie night vision. And they don't weigh alot, but puts enormous strain on your neck after a whole night's marching. Can barely lift your head in the morning. Maybe I'm weak, but then again, I'm sure most of use who have used it would agree that its unwieldly and unbalanced. Once mounted on helmet, helmet tends to droop forward.</p>
              <p>As for firestorm or metal storm, if they were in service, most likely they'd be in arty or motar platoons. Been out of the force, so didn't really get to see it. Are they really in service? Hitman maybe you can educate me on this. Would be cool if they are. But if your in oz and unable to retrieve this info.. then nvm.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I just don't see how much better regulars are, compared to NSF and NSmen. Many regulars are unfit too. Not only in sg, but I'm pretty sure in many of our neighbouring countries too. So I don't have too high hopes for them as well. </p>

              <p>well,,.if u think   a few years in ns not enough then they should sign on!!!!whats so hard to understand?they too afraid to sign on i guess.think they would do an instant commando course than to sign on and have field experience for years with a good pay package.nowadays if u need to know a coordinate on target zone.....theres a GPS for that.just make a call to planes or hq and u will have that place with bombers over it.do u need to take 2 years to train for that job?then it means the training isnt cost effective and can improved everywhere!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> firestorm or metalstorm or the portable xray machines could be improved further.if the funds and people are improved for it.some would rather be holdimg a rifle an yelling that they are the best even though they are about to be wiped out by an immense army .metalstorms once its used by china and rest of world it is no longer regarded as cutting edge but just another weapon.its work principles are very simple n can be made in a farmland so most countries would have it in 10 years.</p>
              <p>the one that u should have would be the non-human type of high tech weapons system to defeat the enemy effectively.</p>
              <p>for instance if some enemy platoon were hiding behind a room or wall...but with that "xray" machine u could know they are there without them knowing u were present.and had u more better weapons u could shoot through a wall with explosives that will detonate in next room without opening the door even.and even better doing all these in the comfort and safety of latest helmet,latest bullet proof vests and  bullet proof goggles.</p>
              <p> but since u got so much $$$$$ wasted in 2 years conscription instead of reducing it n saving $$$$$ and sending contracts to DSO.u folks  will depend heavily on manpower which is a luxury.some ns commandos  would have even turned insane at the end of training without anyone eveer knowing they had already bought the farm.</p>

              <p>Never touched one but I have this suspicion the strain is not due to the weight but the sliding forward and backwards. If one can make the helmet almost totally secure against the head, maybe the strain will be less.</p>

              <p>Hitman, I'd just like to know which part of you NS experience made you such an anti-NS person. I know sometimes the things we do in NS can be quite silly and stupid. But when you think back, you must have done all these stupid things with some very close buddies ain't it? Didn't those times matter? Wasn't it memorable? Fun and even enjoyable at times?</p>
              <p>Well, honestly, if I met a BG or even my CO, a Col, when I salute him. He is obliged to salute back. So.. I don't think its very significant right? Just some military manners.</p>
              <p>As for x-ray vision and firestorm. Haven't seen them in use with the SAF with my own eyes. Only used image intensifiers in my unit, ie night vision. And they don't weigh alot, but puts enormous strain on your neck after a whole night's marching. Can barely lift your head in the morning. Maybe I'm weak, but then again, I'm sure most of use who have used it would agree that its unwieldly and unbalanced. Once mounted on helmet, helmet tends to droop forward.</p>
              <p>As for firestorm or metal storm, if they were in service, most likely they'd be in arty or motar platoons. Been out of the force, so didn't really get to see it. Are they really in service? Hitman maybe you can educate me on this. Would be cool if they are. But if your in oz and unable to retrieve this info.. then nvm.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I just don't see how much better regulars are, compared to NSF and NSmen. Many regulars are unfit too. Not only in sg, but I'm pretty sure in many of our neighbouring countries too. So I don't have too high hopes for them as well. </p>

              <p><br>the regulars are definitley better if their training needs 1 year of  and further experience in the art of warfare  for a few years full time to reinforce it.</p>
              <p>im sure its like u going out to workforce to work.the one that has most experience with the necessary training will do the job well.</p>
              <p>same as being a soldier as long as the experience was gained after standard training.so far its simply a waste and i should say even the generals and warrant officers dislike the idea of having ns conscripts commandos with less than a year yr training instead of skilled regular comandos.thats where technology is suited to replace commandos who may not be exactly normal and happy after being in workforce.however this is a matter of intelligence and knowing what is right n wrong....as for stupidly insane people like underpaid,i should say most here wouldnt  be fighting with him.i know i wouldnt be fighting with crackpots like him in or put of spore.he is simply not like a commando.more like he is really cracked up.which unit has him must really be unlucky.we normally send these folks away.....not fit to be with mainstream of popul;ace.</p>

              alise, it's not the back and forth, the 1st gen NVGs weighed about half a kg, worn on the front of the head, the weight drags your head forward, so after an hour or so, you get a terrible neck ache, much more comfortable to just droop forward. The new NV monocles are much better, lighter and leaves one eye free to judge distances.
              
              As for Metal Storm, the reason why we don't use it is because it's a limited use weapon, you can't reload it unless it's empty like the old Garands, it's all or nothing, so usage is  something like a claymore or an area defence mine, and we already got those.

              Regulars are mostly like shiet in the army la, DXOs still okay but uniformed regulars? Forget it. They follow the regimentation not out of respect, but out of fear and inability to do anything else. If they were so capable, why not use those talents for something more beneficial to Singapore? Join the police and have a more direct impact on our safety perhaps?
              
              Bottomline is ns sucks, we know it, they know it. But they are trying to defend their golden ricebowl with that 'for your own good' shiet, 11 billion dollars people! And there's nothing you can do about it, Singapore isn't run by its people anymore. You have no say herr, unless we do a public demostration. Singapore excels in one thing and one thing only, making you feel useless. I implore the good citizens of Singapore to demostrate how ns made your life lousier than it could have been, all at once, and make a better tomorrow for singapore.

              <p>ans:they might be sissies as they arent ready for staying for months in a swamp .they might even die if forced to run.thats why theres modern technology to replace muscles that they lack as in most asian bodies.using well designed secret technology and intelligence is always part of a trump card in any warefare as in the atomic bomb.as in civilian side using well designed secret technology at that time  and intellegence assures the company making the products such as windows software platform or ps4 would reap profits.</p>
              <p>they fell dead because their nutrition was poor.perhaps they had not eaten food meant for running for a few months but instead used a diet meant for office workers before running the 2.4km in 10 mins.the food in singapore is extremely expensive with some food courts demanding customers pay $8 for a small plate of rice with a few dices of meat , vegetables and a fried egg.</p>

              <p>Think about it this way. WITH NS, our boys are showing
              themselves to be pure sissies many incapable of even running 2.4km
              without dropping dead. NOW imagine if WITHOUT NS, what state our
              'army' boys would be in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't forget, our relations with indonesia and malaysia aren't
              so flowery. Indonesia and Malaysia have tried to invade us on our
              first National Day, They will try again. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think abt it this way: ever asked urselves WHY malaysia still
              bothers to sell us water AT A LOSS? go google it. during the
              negogtiations of our water agreements, LKY once threatened Mahatair
              with all-out war if he ever dared to cut off our water supply. NOW
              ask urselves why big nations like Indonesia and Malaysia would be
              afraid of SIngapore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI: ASK urselves why Indonesia, even if it were to have to stop
              supplying natural gas in the near future, strives to maintain its
              energy contracts with singapore by spending so much effort to look
              for an alternative?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PLUS, the fact that currently, Singapore has the best-equipped
              army plus the largest airforce and navy(indonesia barely matches up
              with its WW2 era planes trololol) in the WHOLE of South-East Asia.
              Try to argue numbers with me, tht goes to show too you guys FAIL at
              understanding modern warfare :)</p>

              <p>but back to this reality,indo n malaysia never sent any

              ok...spore still got the 2 years of national service which is
              rather ineffective and wasteful.in reality 1 year of ns is enough
              and all folks should be sent to be footsoldiers inbstead of
              officers and ncos.those regulars should have that job.much
              money can be saved as a result of shorter ns and be used to build
              better ships,aircrafts and reserach and developement of army
              equipment.we are heading towards 22nd century aqnd should t use old

              <p>Really? Singapore's first national day, Indonesia and Malaysia launched a massive military exercise complete with air forces and paratroopers just 10km off Singapore. before and after that, Indonesia has already been launching a massive terror campaign against Singapore. Forgot abt the macdonalds bombing? WHAT did the UN do? A state-sponsored terror campaign where, if you rmb, Suharto declared he would wipe Singapore off the map shortly after her independence. a few days after he said that, Indo commandos started bombing buildings in singapore. </p>
              <p>FYI: then again, there's the issue of Taiwan's NS. Go compare the sissy standards our own NS regime consists of compared to other nations'. you will find ours barely match up in terms of physical demands and discipline. What taiwan can accomplish in 4 to 6 months, we may take over a year. the standard of singapore NS is VERY watered down already.</p>

              <p>suharto is not sukarno.and what happened afterf all this chaos from indonesia.they had some sanctions on it.macdonalds bombing is less than a platoon,so shouldnt be a big problem.it will only get warm and nice when an entire battalion of paratroopers land.but so far none did.the reason with sending a terror group is because they were too afraid of economic sanctions by UN and they still are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well,u cant build soldiers who were never born physically to be one but u can build better weapons,aircrafts,jets ,bullet proof armour and tanks using the human mind and intelligence.that is all it needs to wipe out even the best from the  imperial japanese army to even the best navy seal units.</p>
              <p>in ww2,russian n american soldiers found out that they were beaten severely by german kids who were 10 years younger than them and physically weaker too.these kids were armed with latest rocket launchers and latest machineguns.had they been armed with something else better.im sure casualties would be hig on american n russian side.latest handheld rockets and machineguns were new things in those days and normally were better compared to russian and americans.yup.....these kids who can hardly run won the battle but due to lack of supply lines lost the war.</p>
              <p>only technology is needed to do mass slaughtering of enemy troops efficiently and quickly.the higher the technology the easier your life will be and victory is in hand.the lower the tech..u might only die in the end losing battles n war.</p>
