              <p>found it.. but its a newer version, seems that it has gone one step further, passive through the wall scanner...</p>

              <p>Through-the-wall detections have many vital applications, including the 
                      potential to conduct surveillance through walls and the ability to detect the 
                      presence of living people behind doors or other barriers. These covert 
                      surveillances and personnel detections are of high interest to both the Defense 
                      Department in urban warfare applications as well as Home Affairs Department for 
                      civilian law enforcement applications.<br><br>This research work assesses the 
                      feasibility of using passive signals (ambient electromagnetic fields for 
                      communication and broadcast services) as the transmission of opportunity in the 
                      through-the-wall motion detection passive radar. In particular, this novel 
                      passive radar technique allows for target detection (and possibly localization) 
                      on the other side of the non-metallic wall at dramatically lower cost and much 
                      portability as compared to existing ultra-wideband through-the-wall active 
                      radar. For this purpose, a low-cost prototype through-the-wall passive radar 
                      receiver system was designed and implemented. <br><br>Experimental trials to 
                      validate the feasibility of motion detection through the wall were conducted 
                      using existing Communication and Broadcast transmissions where using either 
                      passive signal, the Doppler frequency trace profile of the cooperative human 
                      inside an enclosed room corresponding to him walking to and from the brick wall 
                      can be prominently tracked. These encouraging results definitely path the way 
                      for more thorough and in-depth research into this novel ground breaking 
                      through-the-wall passive surveillance radar technology. </p>

              It's a demonstrator project, still pre-prototype stage, and it's parent weighs 10kg, hard to fit something that heavy onto a helmet.
              
              Hitman, my NS courses were Assault Boat, Terminal Air Guidance, Vehicle training, Comms training, Medical course, Combat survival, Escape and evasion, Vehicle identificaton, demolitions, engineering, rappeling, basic military structure (NATO and Warsaw Pact) AND my specialization which I won't divulge here. You try to fit that all into 4 months and find the practice time to get familiar with it too AND add a physical fitness program to it too. I'm betting it's not going to happen.
              
              And this is the short list, I'm sure I forgot some courses. Like Chemical Defence...

              <p>hmmm...at last !someone who can do a meaningful discussion and debate without resulting in death threats and shouting banzai in here.</p>
              <p>the weapons u can afford are not exactly deadly in the context like a minigun that spews a million rounds per minute at a company of soldiers nor weapons of more extremities.the real curtting edge weapons would not be sold cheaply and cant be afforded as they themeselves are secrets in thnat country of make.small arms would be affordable but when dealing with enemy using flamethrowers and other newer weapons by enemy irregardles if they are norwegian or china army..the spore is but only a deterent.its rather using the same weapon as any country thats developed.but if u were to fight with say a german army..im not sure spore could win in a small battle in a town.why??</p>
              <p>firstly asian troops tend  lack muscles as they are of asian size which would be fatal in a hand to hand combat with european or other races who have more muscle mass per inch on their body.</p>
              <p>secondly most humans dismiss that they could allways rely on sheer mass to envelope the enemy which close to suicidal .the enemy may have 100 million soldiers and u may have every kid and granny given conventionalbazookas it will still be futile.</p>
              <p>3rdly from historical lessons obtained from the decimated japanese army with the australians in ww2.much was learnt that an army made from fokks who hail from samurai districts would be wiped out completely by kids and farmers armed with submachine guns.the cutting edge weapons for the japs were only the conventional ariska rifles which the japs claimed was more than enough for any battle.the rifle was poor in fire power to the submachineguns that the  untrained australian kids were using against seasoned jap soldiers in the jungles.the main aim was to kill as many as possible and the japs just couldnt grasp it and whats worse that no technology was ever used by the japs to transport their troops to fight in kokoda.the japs were to satisfied with the weapons they had until they saw what kids with portable machine guns did to their precious battalion.and a japanese commando equivalent unit at that!90% were killed off against aussie kids n fat farmers armed with better weapons than the japs.the m4 ...or any rifle is about the same equivalent as there are much more deadlier weapons .</p>
              <p>commitement to defence is one thing....but defeat after commitment is unforgiveable.the choice of weapons and plans should be planned effectively or else spore might suffer the same fate as those unfortunate japanese commandoes who fought against aussie kids n fat men with tommy guns.</p>

              You do realise the "million round per minute" gun is the Redback/Metal Storm?
                                             
              By Metal Storm/STK?... We can't afford it and it's top secret? From it's own manufacturers?
                                      
              "secondly most humans dismiss that they could allways rely on sheer mass to envelope the enemy which close to suicidal .the enemy may have 100 million soldiers and u may have every kid and granny given conventionalbazookas it will still be futile."
                                      
              Tell that to the Japs who charged American 15-pounder guns with canister at Guadalcanal or the Israelis who got pinned by massed RPG-fire during Cast Lead. 100 million soldiers? That's a well thought out number. Not. You pissed off the Russians and the US at the same time? With the Chinese for good measure? Knowing you, it's a possibility.
                                      
              For a yardstick comparison, the whole US army only numbers half a million active combat troops, the Russians 1.03, the Chinese about 2.2M in total. Where does anyone hit one hundred million?
                  
              And against even 2.2M, a serious conscription of Singaporean personel might be able to scratch up a force within shouting distance of it, so it's not totally hopeless. Unlike Hitman.

              Agreed, BMT was the bare basic, nothing more. There was still ACT, SISPEC/SAFTI and vocation schools, not to mention the specific physical fitness regime needed for specific jobs, like swim training for divers, endurance training for long range scouts etc.
              
              Have to admit though, it was fun and funny at times. I'll never forget my demo lessons when the instructor was demonstrating an improvised door breeching charge, the one using socks to carry TNT flakes. 
              
              "You place it around the doorknob like this, then after it blows, you can kick the door open."
              *Boom!!* 
              "Sir, you said kick the door open, which piece do we kick? That one, that one or that one?" :P
              
              Too much TNT. lol

              And don't get me started on Aunties washing your plates for you. NS is supposed to be a rite of passage when Singaporean boys grow up to be men. "Auntie,can wash plate for me?" simply does NOT jive with this image. Yes, you may say the time may be better spent elsewhere, but where's the learning of responsibility? Of caring for your own stuff like your mess tray and utensils, the MOST basic items? Or is this a carry over of "Mommy wash my plates?" or "Maid, wash this for me?" Either way, washing your own basic stuff is NOT time wasted, it teaches you something important.

              <p>most  12 year old boy scouts did field camps for weeks in a jungle swamp in monsoon weather and its elements with no electricity,cheaply and with no army support.why u all making so much noise over a 5 day field camping with mindef support?u folks are soft from the start without realising or being able to cope with it.sit test???if sit test could be translated to real life...spore wouldnt be a place where bank interests is negligible and train stations falling apart and orchard road being flooded.it all isnt working or have no connection with real life situations really.so dun pin yer hopes on sit tests....</p>
              <p>if u need to be commandoes ,pilots,special forces unit....im afraid that cant be done and fully utilised on a mere 2 year or 1 year  ns stint.it should have been a 3 year ns instead for trainings that need more than a year of training condensed or otherwise..in which case u should simply sign on as a regular if u need badly to be a commando  or special forces.</p>

              Uncle, that's like holding a bag of rice. You go try it, then come tell us if it's workable. And you need it helmet mounted, unless you want to be holding it instead of your rifle in a hostile zone. I suppose you can use it as a club if the enemy gets too close, though I bet you'll be full of 5.56 holes by that time.
                  
              Seriously no imagination and predictive ability. I'd love an op-force like you, they'll all be holding extra heavy detectors and not rifles while people gun you down with simple P227s.
              
              And just because you sign on doesn't make you a CDO or pilot, many regulars end up in sai kang infantry units to hold hands of crap soldiers like Hitman. Which makes him a drain on resources.
              
              And I'd love to see the Boy Scout unit that camped for weeks in monsoon conditions. They were also 8 feet tall and can pluck trees out with one hand right?

              <p>your statistics on the amount of russian soldiers and american soldiers are warped.what about the soldiers who died in ww2?was it 100 million dead soldiers??or was it 50 million dead soldiers?soldiers can be drafted in suddenly so 1 mil in a certain army can be 3 million as seen in ww2 and before ww2.</p>

              You yourself were comparing that American soldiers were bigger than us, forget so soon? Alzeimers? And I know for a fact that even American soldiers don't carry 10kg detectors into insurgent zones, too bulky. It's for hostage situations where you have time to set up a static array.
              
              Firestorm lol, get it right you drooling idiot. It's Metal Storm, and don't tell me "it's the other one", there is only one weapon with that performance bracket.
              
              You still fighting WWII is it? Go wiki the active personel for the countries, see if it's accurate.
              
              And we don't use X-ray. We use thermal, good to see through foilage and trees, not through walls. X-ray is still experimental. Thermal is in field and in use, not stuck in theoryland. You used one before? I doubt it. You're a "Zhi Shang Tan Bing" (Talk soldiering on paper) kind of idiot who'll die as cannon fodder in war. I can't see any army using you in any meaningful task without serious risk of stupidity happening.

              <p>You yourself were comparing that American soldiers were bigger than us, forget so soon? Alzeimers? And I know for a fact that even American soldiers don’t carry 10kg detectors into insurgent zones, too bulky. It’s for hostage situations where you have time to set up a static array.</p>
              <p>Firestorm lol, get it right you drooling idiot. It’s Metal Storm, and don’t tell me “it’s the other one”, there is only one weapon with that performance bracket.</p>
              <p>You still fighting <span>WWII</span> is it? Go wiki the active personel for the countries, see if it’s accurate.</p>
              <p>And we don’t use X-ray. We use thermal, good to see through foilage and trees, not through walls. X-ray is still experimental. Thermal is in field and in use, not stuck in theoryland. You used one before? I doubt it. You’re a “Zhi Shang Tan Bing” (Talk soldiering on paper) kind of idiot who’ll die as cannon fodder in war. I can’t see any army using you in any meaningful task without serious risk of stupidity happening.</p>

              <p><br>well..now u admit americans are bigger n stronger than sporean soldiers???well what the pointof having 2 years ns then?????just skip some trainings in that case.i wasnt talking about a gorilla if they have in spore holding a 10kg equipment..obviously u havent been to enough trainings n need to ask me how u going to handle a 10kg weight??!!thats where i doubt you ever had entered ns.and how do u know if americans use or didnt use the 10kg detectors in a war when u thought it was science fiction gizmo until me and tripwire showed u that they do really exist in real life!if u didnt know those detectors existed initially then high chance u didnt know if they were ever used or not.</p>
              <p>of course u use thermal!!!the $$$$$ that should have been used to buy those "x-ray"equipment was squandered away on trainings that shouldnt be.even though it was made in spore 10 years ago it was left to progress too slow due to money channleed to expensive and unnecesary trainings for ns conscription.the contracts could be made from saved $$$$$ from ns to ask DSO to continue their work 10 years ago to make it lighter.......but folks like u need commando training for 2 or 2.5 years which would see the xray goggles like a distant wish.</p>
              <p>and this is firestorm which is the same stuff as metal storm&gt;&gt;&gt;<img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://www.metalstorm.com/images/stories/firestorm2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200"></p>
              <p>ww2,,,napoleonic wars..tsun tzu art of wars.....is relavent because thats what generals study and use.no one use wiki for those decsions making process.....they have intellihgence units...or did they channel the $$$$$ to ns conscription n squandered it?</p>

              <p>And don’t get me started on Aunties washing your plates for you.
              NS is supposed to be a rite of passage when Singaporean boys grow
              up to be men. “Auntie,can wash plate for me?” simply does
              <span>NOT</span> jive with this image. Yes, you may say
              the time may be better spent elsewhere, but where’s the learning of
              responsibility? Of caring for your own stuff like your mess tray
              and utensils, the <span>MOST</span> basic items? Or is
              this a carry over of “Mommy wash my plates?” or “Maid, wash this
              for me?” Either way, washing your own basic stuff is <span>NOT</span> time wasted, it teaches you something important.</p>
              <p>Hitman’s <span>SIT</span> was changed to <span>IMMEDIATE CASTRATION</span>-BREEDING <span>DANGER</span>.</p>

              <p>It depends on unit.</p>
              <p>Mine had FTs to clean up everyday for us including toilets, and on normal days, plates and utensils not washed by our own, but by a specialised person.</p>
