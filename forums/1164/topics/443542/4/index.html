              <p>there is great wisdom in having conscripts do a lesser term ns of 4 moinths.its to teach them and recall them back in case of emergencies.the extra $$$$ saved on not training NS would be  needed to buy drones like those used by the usa or to build one.</p>
              <p>why train kids who would forget which direction to fire in a room clearance  drillwhen u could channel the $$$$$ to regulars or gurkhas  instead.</p>
              <p>and i would prefer u act like an adult instead of a jealous kid with a tantrum for not being selected for any great missions or mission even.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its common sense...would u want to placea bet on  a team of footballers with less than 2 years of training and matches or bet on a team of footballers who have 10 years of the people with more training and experrience.all this are under serious conditions with no goofing off on both sides.</p>

              Hitman, your "basic" training may have been 4 months for cheap cannon fodder like you, mine was almost a year before I was considered "active NSman".
              
              And I call bullshit on your "great mission". The only thing of note that could even be considered "great" is the Boxing Day Tsunami relief efforts, which, if you took part in, STILL does not give you tactical understanding or training. And besides, it's probably a "group salute", not to you personally. Doubt the general even knows you exist.
              
              You complain of the survivability of our troops, then recommend cutting training to even below the bare basic. How does that improve survivability? And drones? Drone operator course + BMT is even longer than 4 months, you cut cost to buy drones that no one will have the training to use. Your logic seriously fails.

              <p>thats what i have been telling u not very bright folks to get more regulars instead of relying on cheaper forms of soldiers.if u consider troops of 4months as cannon fodder then perhaps ns troops with 2 years would be considered as cannon fodder as compared to regular professionals with 10 years "training"so if u are an ns and there are folks who think like u...then all the ns conscripts are classified as cannon fodder and expendables.thats your logic to the world that we dont need.</p>
              <p>relief efforts????u need a miitary to do relief efforts?then u should be in a red cross mission insteD OF A MILITary mission.your verion of a military and its associated missions is only limited to a nurse looking after the sick.</p>
              <p>u need to survive???train harder and in real battle conditions!dont come here with your miserable mistake of conscription .u may be cheap....u may not be military....u may not even have thought of the military as a career. in conclusion u shouldnt be preaching about real soldiers or your part time ns soldiers in here.its your logic thats in question.</p>
              <p>drones are very expensive equipment.they dont need ns for it.why should they get part time soldiers to fly them???in that case they might as well get ns conscription pilots to fly F-14 jet fighters or get ns conscripts to become admirals and generals too!from your point of logic,u expect too much from a mere 2 years of ns.in which case one should sign on as a regular...if u know theres too much at stake and cant do it in 2 years then go for a regular service.2 years  isnt enough to earn confidence in most military units.,,,so i guess cannon fodder confidence should be around there.u really are cannon fodder from looks of it.</p>
              <p>but perhaps you arent smart enough to figure out  stuff on your own.lemme show u what u gave to your world:</p>
              <p>Under the Ming dynasty, being a soldier was an inherited condition. This meant that the Ming army was recruited from a professional warrior class, however, quite unlike indo-european societies where the warrior class typically held high status (and often political power), the Ming-era Chinese considered their soldiers to be scum. This had a strong negative impact on the motivation and morale of their troops. The system's main advantage was that it allowed easy replacement of casualties--if a soldier was killed, his family had to furnish a replacement or lose their livelyhood and end up as beggars...<br><br><br>The Ming infantry was organised into "companies" of 112 men each. These units, like European lances, were essentially admnistrative units containing proportions of different specialist troops  which would logically be grouped together on the battlefield. About 40% of the ming footsoldiers (in theory, of course) were spearmen/pikemen, forming the main battle-line and holding off the attacks of the enemy, especially the cavalry of the steppe nomads. About as many soldiers would be armed with some kind of ranged weapon--bow, crossbow, or fire-arm of some kind (however, after the Yongle emperor, firearms were deployed by seperate 'firearms battalions'), so the Ming armies could put out a considerable volume of fire (quite necessary when facing horse-archer-based foes, might I add). The remainder were sword-and-shield troops, ostensibly to attack and defeat enemy infantry. The foot-soldiers were armoured with various combinations of chain, brigandine, and lamellar.<br><br>One feature that has to be noted about the Ming military was its centralisation, often excessive given the limitations of the time. The Ming government often re-equiped and re-trained entire armies for a specific campaign (see for instance Yongle's intensive preparations for his invasion of Dai Viet); however, Ming troops often lacked part (or even all) of their regular default equipment. The hereditary military system also made it impossible to adjust the military's size to the empire's current needs rapidly (in theory, the number of soldiers ought always to be the same) so that during times of relative peace large segments of the army were employed in a non-military capacity--noteably to transport grain to Beijing after Yongle moved his capital back there. This was expedient and economical, but ruined the fighting ability of the units concerned and eventually that of the entire army.<br><br>The Ming employed a vast number of weird and wondrous firearms and siege weapons. Perhaps the most important fire-arm was the fire lance--essentially a spear packed in a disposable launch tube and fired from the shoulder, like a modern anti-tank weapon. It filled broadly the same role as the latter, being able to penetrate just about any armour, and, according to the claims of some contemporary Chinese sources, several soldiers in one go (take this with a barrow-load of salt, however). Fire arrows (rocket-propelled arrows), various types of gonnes (including repeating ones), hand grenades, large rocket-missiles and a miscelleany of light and very light cannons were also common. Grapeshot was known and often fired from light, tripod-mounted guns that could be carried around by a two-man team. It should be noted that the Ming usually made use of iron bullets. Compared to lead projectiles, this made for smaller holes in people but superior armour-piercing abilities. In addition to killing people, the firearms were also extremely scary, especially for the Sout-East Asian elephants that had long been the bane of Chinese armies.</p>

              You're still pretty swakoo. Our LSTs were deployed on relief efforts during that disaster. I'm not talking about future theory deployment or paper strategy, I'm talking about something that already happened, you got a problem with it, go talk to the Rear Admiral and tell him that it was supposed to be the Red Cross's job.
              
              And with all your trash talk about "secret missions" you never even told us which branch were you from. You tell me the branch, I can even make an approximate guess as the which "exercise" you took part in.
              
              As for the soldier caste, Singapore did try that out, during the time of child soldiers. It was an untalked about cousin to the SDU project, military instead of for graduates. It was.. fairly fail. Most of the children went to other fields, though some did take up military jobs, but the majority went elsewhere.
              
              This is the same problem with your "regulars". There isn't enough of them to stand-off the whole Indo or Malaysian army, no matter how "experienced" or "regular" or even "decaffinated", it still takes just one shot to kill, and numbers means you get a lot of chances for the shot. Conscripts, on the other hand HAVE the numbers, and with the interior position and home ground advantage, can be a deterence or even make taking Singaporean ground extremely costly.
              
              Maybe it's not me expecting to much from a conscript, maybe it's you expecting too little.
              
              "dont come here with your miserable mistake of conscription .u may be cheap....u may not be military....u may not even have thought of the military as a career. in conclusion u shouldnt be preaching about real soldiers or your part time ns soldiers in here.its your logic thats in question."

              Damn, any worse punctuation and spelling, and I'd expect you to start drooling.
              
              Long story short, YOU FAIL!! You're just here to whine about how you were "cheated" of 2 years by Singapore. Don't like it, immigrate. If Australia would want you, which I have doubts. Maybe you can get refugee status? You obviously fled from logic.

              <p>with each soldier saved thats a 1 year 8 mth savings IN FOOD,WEAPON,TRAININGS AND UNIFORMS .</p>
              <p>TOTAL COST FOR A MEAL WOULD BE $10 A DAY SAVED AT LEAST PER SOLDIER.</p>

              <p>UNIFORMS TOO WOULD BE $1000 SAVED</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>TOTAL COST SAVED PER NS CONSCRIPT SOLDIER IN A YEAR WOULD BE MEALS: 365DAYS X $10=$3650</p>
              <p>TRAININGS PER YEAR = $1000</p>
              <p>UNIFORMS PER YEAR = $1000</p>
              <p>TOTAL COST PER YEAR FOR A SOLDIER = $3650+$1000 +$1000=$5650</p>
              <p>WITH A 4 MONTHS NS CONSCRIPTION  WITH YEARLY RESERVIST DUTIES AN ARMY CAN SAVE AROUND $8K PER SOLDIER OR AT LEAST $240,000/YEAR FOR A A PLATOON.</p>
              <p>THAT SAVINGS COULD BE USED TO BUY A DRONE OR HAVE CONTRACTS MADE OUT TO SINGAPORE technologies to build even better drones with better software and have the firepower of a platoon.</p>

              <p>reducing ns doesnt mean abolish it!!!!the $$$$ saved on conscripts  can be channeled for better military  purposes in acquisition of better coventional weapons that u folks at company level would be wiped out completely.</p>

              SBS, I totally agree, those who are not frontline units, they don't see that others are being trained harder than they are, and I'm one of those who think that 2 years is too short, you'll only be in your "active" phase for only half a year, how familiar can you get with your job in that short a time?
              
              And with all his whining about buying drones, I bet he's never touched one in his entire life.
