Its Military is similar to our SAF being manned by NSF men and women.<br><br>Can Israel have the financial and material resources to fight terrorist everywhere and anywhere ?<br><br>As it is, the Israeli budget is being supported by USA - to the tune of over US$5 Billion annually to prop up the Israeli economy and military.<br><br>Allowing Israel to go after terrorist everywhere and anywhere is political suicide for the World, as it will allow WW-3 to begin.<br><br>Israel has been targetting the family of every suicide bomber, by blowing up their homes, and this practise has been going on for more then 10 years.<br><br>Has it stop the determination of other suicide bombers, who see it an honor to stop further Israeli aggression towards the homeland of these "terrorists" ?<br><br>The only way to stop terrorism is for USA to deal firmly with Israeli belligerence on an equal basis as USA is dealing firmly with the Palestinian terrorism.<br><br>As matters stand, just as Israeli and the Palestinian Government have both accepted the US "Road Map towards Peace", the Israeli Government has been building their own version of the "Great Wall of China" that serves as a security wall to prevent future terrorists from easily entering Israel.<br><br>This Israeli Wall is being built NOT along the UN recognised "Green Line" separating the two communities, but Israel has purposefully built the Wall by grabbing land from the Palestinian families - destroying the livelihood of many Palestinians who own Olive farms on this land.<br><br>In a BBC documentary that was aired two weeks ago, it visited the disputed land on which the Israeli Wall is being built, and even filmed Israeli contractors stealing whole olive trees, by using trucks with cranes lifting the entire tree onto the truck and driving it back into Israel. All this was done under Israeli Military Protection.<br><br>This is Jewish thievery with Jewish State protection - they not only steal land from the Arabs, and destroy the Arab farms, but take away the Arab plants.<br><br>This is typical arrogance of Israel that is fueling the hatred from the weaker Arab communities towards these greedy Jews, and does not help in the eradication of terrorists.<br><br>Terrorism in the Middle-East was started by the early Jewish Settlers - (in their fight against the British Colonial Government) - for the right to allow more Jews to return to this land and create the State of Israel.<br><br>Israeli is not innocent in the use of terrorism against authority, as it introduced such terrorist methods into the psychic of the Middle-eastern minds.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By my understanding of your approach in dealing with terrorism, it will mean - "For one of my eye I will take two of yours, and more ( ? ) ".<br><br>Will it ever solve the problem or problems that certain groups of people are prepared to use acts of terrrorism to resolve their perceived aggrieved position ?<br><br>For every terrorists killed, a martyr is created, and more like minded persons are willing to step into the shoes.<br><br>What do you propose to do next ?<br><br>Kill more for every terrorist and their supporters that dare to act in your land ?<br><br>Your solution may as well go for full ethnic cleansing, and wipe out the entire Arab race living in an area known by all as Palestine, since a large majority of them are sympathetic to the cause of the terrorists.<br><br>You will need to go for this full ethnic cleansing as a very large majority in the Palestinian Arab community feel justified in using such self-sacrificing violence to hurt the Israeli Jewish Community.<br><br>This is the only way for a desparately frustrated Palestinian Arab community to retaliate against the military might of the Jewish State.<br><br>The Palestinian Arab are no match against the military might of the Jewish State, nor against the Jewish State intellectual brilliance in cultivating international support for their arrogant self-righteous acts of grabbing land away from the Palestinian Arab Community.<br><br>The Jewish State is squeezing on the conscience of the World Community - (for the Nazi destruction to their Community during WW-2) - and is manipulating France, Germany, UK and USA from acting against the interest of the Jewish State.<br><br>Resolve the Land Rights of the Palestinian Arabs, and provide an International Guarantee to the borders separating Israel and the proposed Palestinian State, and allow a workable border arrangement to exist so as to guarantee each other's economic and political independence, then one of the main cause for terrorism will be resolved.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>by your opinion.. there would seems that there are no way to stop terrorism except to give in to them...<br><br>if we ask isreal to give in to terrorism...  what is there to prevent those bastards from resorting to terrorism again and again to achieve their every tiny demand??<br><br>the world needs to stand firm against terrorism... if not.. all sides of a conflict would start to resort to terrorism to achieve their respective objectives... then there will never be peace nor security in the future.<br><br>IT is unfortunate that drastic measures have to be taken to discourage terrorism.. since appeasement would led to endless list of demands....<br><br>the formation of a palestinian state is not going to make terrorism disappear as many terrorist organizations are currently being sponsored and protected by legitimate state outside palestine, thus as long as their masters pay... there will be among them foxes and wolfs who would seek out the foolish and the mundane to carry bombs on their bellies....<br><br>states like syria and iran are using terrorist organizations to further their national agenda... and they knew that short of an all out war against them.. they can continue to fund such organizations to destabilise, terrorise and devastate their neighbours...with impunity.<br><br>thus my position is quite simple... the only way to deter terrorism to bring the horrors and sufferings of terrorist right into the homes of terrorist...<br><br>only when both sides realised the pain and sufferings, would people on both side of the divide seeks to limit such agony.<br><br>just as through the horrors of war... did man realise the value of peace... terrorist must be forced to face the pain and consequence of their actions to wake up their fu cking idea about being martyer.<br><br>as such... though it is unfortunate... but examples must be made to show future terrorist.. that ... if they engage in terrorist activity.. they automatically forfeit their familes security, safety and lifes as well.... so as to let them know that their acts of martyerdom is paid for with the bloods of not only the innocents but their family love ones as well....<br><br>perhaps then ... they would realise... the price of martydom is far higher then he is willing to pay... his live may be worthless to him... but to put his entire family on the firing line... now that is a very different price to pay....</div>

when one realise that fire inflict pain and suffering..... thus as in war... terrorist must feel the pain of loosing their family for them to realise the true cost of their actions.. to others as well as to themselves.<br><br>It will require a joint effort from the World Community, and the leadership of the US, to put pressure on the wealthy and moderate Arab Countries to work with the entire World Community to remove the present causes that create this community of Islamic Terrorists.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that i am afraid is not gonna happend... simply because... there are states that benefits from such terrorist activities...<br><br>The additional solution - besides resolving the Israeli-Palestinian issue - is the eradication of poverty and poor government system in most of these Islamic Countries.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you wait long long,....<br><br>The present Road Map to Peace - as proposed by USA - is seeing to it that this will happen, and this can only happen with the intellectual guidance of great minds in the US Government that include the likes of Condeleeza Rice, Colin Powell, and other moderates working behind the scene supporting the major politcal players in the White House.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dont hold your breath.... hahahaa....<br><br>The Hawks had their day, and their policies have won the War but the Peace maybe lost.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the jury is still out on this... so ... dont judge so soon,,,<br><br>Let us allow the Moderates to have their time now and let them work to win the Peace.<br><br></div></blockquote>while the terrorist continue to chalk up their kill score... its just a matter of time.. before the world would realise... the best way to deal with fire... is with fire....</div>
