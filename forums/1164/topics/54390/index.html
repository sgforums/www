            <div class='col-md body'>sorry...bad gateway. So i've cut and paste the whole article. Enjoy!<br><br>Sexual fantasies of a suicide bomber<br>By Reuven Koret  August 16, 2001<br><br>A bizarre scene transpired in the Wall Street CafÃ© near Haifa a couple of days ago. A 28-year old Palestinian walked into the restaurant and raised his shirt to reveal his explosives belt to the young waitress. "Do you know what this is?" he asked, as he lit the fuse.<br><br>The waitress knew. She screamed and tossed a menu at him, the diners fled, the owner threw a chair at the guy. By the time he screamed Allah Akhbar and blew himself to smithereens, there was no one around to take with him. What struck me, only later, was that there was something distinctly sexual in his behavior. He was basically showing off his manhood, saying in effect, with intent to terrify: "See what a big powerful stick of dynamite I have. And you know what, just watch, I'm going to kill you with it."<br><br>When I considered the classic profile of the suicide bombers -- young men in their late teens and twenties, the sexual dimension of their murderous motivation became striking. Here are these poor, anonymous guys, living desperate dead-end lives. Living in a strict Moslem environment, they have no permitted sexual outlet. How attractive must it be to become world-famous for a day or two! How empowering to know that you can single-handedly take the lives of innocent people, especially those dangerous and forbidden Israeli women!<br><br>Vindication of that perception comes from the Palestinian Authority's daily Al-Hayat al-Jedidah, which reported in a front-page article several days ago that "the occupation is using naked women to hunt down intifada youth." The article said that last Friday, during a clash near Karni in Gaza, a woman soldier suddenly appeared on top of a tank. "She started to take off her clothes in front of the demonstrators until she was [nearly] naked. Some of the protesters said they were disgusted by it, while others said the Zionist soldier made rude gestures at them," the paper reported. "When they approached to throw stones at her, the female soldier whipped out a pistol from her underwear and shot at their heads," the paper said, adding that two were killed and nine wounded. It gives a whole new meaning to the Gaza Strip.<br><br>Contrast the fearsome image of the Zionist woman warrior, her Uzi in her undies, with the soothing vision offered by Moslem preachers and provocateurs. They repeat Islam's promise that unlimited sexual congress with seventy-two virgins awaits the martyr.<br><br>The Koran, the sacred book of Islam, describes the virgins as "beautiful like rubies, with complexions like diamonds and pearls." In another Koranic passage, it is said that the martyrs and virgins shall "delight themselves, lying on green cushions and beautiful carpets."<br><br>Talk about offers you can't refuse! Just imagine: press the button, light the fuse, enjoy your last moments on earth in an explosive orgasmic orgy of death, then be transported to the heights of sexual bliss.<br><br>Israeli forensic pathologists were quoted in the press as noting that a suicide bomber's genital areas are often trussed in protective material to prevent (excessive) damage to the precious cargo. One would not want to disappoint the virgins!<br><br>The same consideration is not extended to the intended victims, where dismemberment is the goal. USA Today's Jack Kelley, in an in-depth article focusing on the suicide bomber who killed 21 in a Tel Aviv disco, interviews a young boy indoctrinated in the destruction and torture of Jewish bodies by his preachers and teachers.<br><br>At an Islamic school in Gaza City run by Hamas, 11-year-old Palestinian student Ahmed's small frame and boyish smile are deceiving, Kelley writes, masking a determination to kill at any cost. "I will make my body a bomb that will blast the flesh of Zionists, the sons of pigs and monkeys," Ahmed says. "I will tear their bodies into little pieces and cause them more pain than they will ever know."<br><br>"Allahu Akbar," his classmates shout in response: "God is great."<br><br>"May the virgins give you pleasure," his teacher yells, referring to one of the rewards awaiting martyrs in paradise. Even the principal smiles and nods his approval, reports Kelley. Another would-be bomber tells him that the vision of sexual paradise makes it all worthwhile: "I know my life is poor compared to Europe or America, but I have something awaiting me that makes all my suffering worthwhile," says Bassam Khalifi, 16, a Hamas youth leader in Gaza's Bureij refugee camp. "Most boys can't stop thinking about the virgins."<br><br>Fortunately for Israel, the desires of the young Palestinian men have often exceeded their ability to perform. Again and again, would-be suicide attackers explode themselves at the wrong time, in the wrong place, rarely achieving the hoped-for result. They have "work accidents." Indeed, like the "Wall Street" bomber, the desire to display his equipment to the waitress prevented successful completion of his act. He prematurely ejaculated.<br><br>Israel seems to have learned to act in a way that addresses subliminally the underlying pathology of the terrorists. When Israeli commandos strike deep into Palestinian territories to decapitate terror organizations by targeting their leaders; when Israel seizes control of the symbols of Palestinian power; when troops in tanks, with only the puniest of resistance, raze to the ground those structures that served to highlight the prowess and prestige of the Palestinian Police -- all these acts are designed to symbolically emasculate the enemy, to ruin his confidence, to induce in him the ultimate castration anxiety.<br><br>It was a source of grim amusement in Israel to learn today that, after, a modest contingent of tanks and bulldozers circled the town of Jenin and entered the center of town with little or no resistance, destroyed utterly a few select buildings, and then left a couple hours later, strictly according to plan, with no casualties on our side or theirs, the Palestinians officially announced that their brave and popular resistance had driven Israel from their town. They held parades and demonstrations to celebrate their manliness, shooting their guns in the air "to tell the guys" how well they performed the previous night.<br><br>Israel's policy of active defense -- targeting Palestinian terrorist heads and destroying its symbols of power, without harming innocent men, women and children -- attempts to deal in a mature and civilized way with a perversion that seeks to paralyze and overwhelm us. Unfortunately, it has not proven effective in stopping suicide bombings. On the contrary, there's a ready supply of young men waiting for their turn with the seventy virgins.<br><br>Sex and death are linked by power in the hands of the suicide bombers. Even if most are incompetent, or impotent, it only takes one successful attack to destroy many lives. We can't be satisfied with ninety percent success. We must do everything necessary, however distasteful, to stop this scourge which is undermining our way of life.<br><br>Israeli policy in response to Arab assaults may not always be pretty, or popular, but one doesn't deal with suicide bombers and their masters by cajoling and threatening them. One doesn't philosophize about them, or pity them, or empathize with their suffering, or help them become productive members of society. One deals with them by cutting them down to size, by excising them from civilization. The punishment should fit the crime.<br><br>There is a belief in Islam that contact of a corpse with the skin of a pig prevents entry into paradise and the pleasures that there await the martyr. The British, in their colonial past, put down Moslem rebellions, also featuring suicide bombings, by burying rebels in pigskin. Israeli security officials, citing this precedent, have recommended adoption of the policy. So far their recommendations have been rejected. But perhaps their suggestion wasn't specific enough.<br><br>One need not wrap all body parts in pigskin. A selected pound of flesh should suffice. Indeed (don't tell anybody) one may not need to do anything at all: what matters is that the would-be bomber is convinced that Israel does, and will. For maximum effect, perhaps it can be suggested that the cutting and wrapping can be performed by the legendary Zionist woman warrior with the pistol in her panties. Bizarre and repulsive as this "modest proposal" may sound to liberal Western ears, the unmentionable idea, conveyed credibly through local channels, would have a powerful deterrent effect on the young men dreaming about terrifying and killing Jewish women, thus impressing all those seventy virgins. Such a campaign would not help the recruitment efforts of the suicide bomber dispatchers.<br><br>Indeed, all those involved in the terror game should be informed discreetly that they too would be eligible for similar post-mortem gift-wrapping. For a limited time only, Israel should even offer free overnight shipping to paradise. It's the least we can do to make the appropriate sexual fantasies of these impotent and emasculated terrorists -- brave and manly only when they are holding a stick of explosives in their hands -- come true.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>The breeding grounds for terrorists are ignorance, poverty, envy, discrimination, deprivation, injustice, and the total impotence to correct all that is done wrong to the society or community from which these terrorists come from.<br><br>The Palestinians feel a great injustice has been done to their community or society by the return of the Jews - from Europe and other distant lands from which they have been discriminated - after WW-2.<br><br>The lands from which the Palestinian Arabs have lived through the centuries were forcibly taken from them by the British Colonial Government, to make way for those <strong>Few Thousand </strong>Jews from Europe - especially those who survive and rescued from the Nazi Death Camps.<br><br>However, those few thousand Jews - who initially landed in Palestine - then started a campaign to smuggle more Jews into this piece of Middle East land. These Jews used terrorist methods of bombing and kidnapping against the British Government and their families residing in the territories of covering present day Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt including the Sinai Peninsula.<br><br>The Jews were then a deprived lot but not ignorant in the use and manipulation of politics and terrorism.<br><br>The Palestinian Arabs (for want of any better term to call this community of people) remain impotent - politically and militarily - to face the ingenuity and influence of the Jewish Community.<br><br>Even as the present US sponsored Peace Process is being respected by Israel, it is unfortunate to see Israel building a security fence that do not respect the Internationally recognised Green Line - (that separate Israeli international border and agreed Palestinian territories) - and have gone against international opinion by forcilbly encroaching into Palestinian family lands, destroying their agricultural crops and economy.<br><br>Unlike the Palestinians, who are mainly Arabs by birth, culture and history are Muslims, the Malays in South-east Asia are not in any way identical to the Palestinians.<br><br>The Malays in South-east Asia have been historically recorded to have come under the influence of Hinduism, Annimism, and only during recent history adopted Islam when Arabs traders brought the religion over to this region.<br><br>Throughout the history of this region, much of the economic activities have been performed by peoples from other races, while the Malays prefer a life of pleasure and leisure.<br><br>With a starting disadvantage of a community that have known to marrry from within the same community and same family lines, it can only do harm to the Malay genetic characteristics over time.<br><br>The present poverty, lack of education, ignorance resulted in perceived injustice and deprivation, and caused envy towards the other more successful races in this region.<br><br>By feeling left out from the main stream and successful communities of the South-east Asia - who largely follow Budhism, Christianity, Hinduism - the Malays identified their lot more closely with the down trodden Arabs, who themselves are seemingly seen to be helpless against Western Colonial and Imperialist Powers.<br><br>Since Terrrorism is a weapon of choice that allow the Arabs to threaten the Israelis sense of security, the same is seen to be effective to promote the cause of these South-east Asian Terrorists, who are largely Muslim and from the Malay Community - and who perceived themselves to be down trodden, discriminated and with injustice similarly done to them.<br><br>To erradicate terrorism, the first move is to identify them, isolate them from their community, and dry up the breeding ground from which they self-generate - by erradicating the problems that cause them to believe in their cause.<br><br>Remove poverty, improve education standards, improve the dissemination of information, improve good government, law and order to show transparency that Justice is done, and with improve and equal distribution of economic wealth, terrorism can be combatted and won.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IAF:</div><div class="quote_body">bad gateway</div></blockquote>nvm i CnP the whole thing out<br><br>It is widely believed that Muslim 'martyrs' enjoy rich sensual rewards on reaching paradise. A new study suggests they may be disappointed. Ibn Warraq reports<br>Special report: religion in the UK<br><br>Saturday January 12, 2002<br>The Guardian<br><br>In August, 2001, the American television channel CBS aired an interview with a Hamas activist Muhammad Abu Wardeh, who recruited terrorists for suicide bombings in Israel. Abu Wardeh was quoted as saying: "I described to him how God would compensate the martyr for sacrificing his life for his land. If you become a martyr, God will give you 70 virgins, 70 wives and everlasting happiness." Wardeh was in fact shortchanging his recruits since the rewards in Paradise for martyrs was 72 virgins. But I am running ahead of things .<br><br>Since September 11, news stories have repeated the story of suicide bombers and their heavenly rewards, and equally Muslim scholars and Western apologists of Islam have repeated that suicide is forbidden in Islam. Suicide (qatlu nafsi-hi) is not referred to in the Koran but is indeed forbidden in the Traditions (Hadith in Arabic), which are the collected sayings and doings attributed to the Prophet and traced back to him through a series of putatively trustworthy witnesses. They include what was done in his presence that he did not forbid, and even the authoritative sayings and doings of his companions.<br><br>But the Hamas spokesman correctly uses the word martyr (shahid) and not suicide bomber, since those who blow themselves up almost daily in Israel and those who died on September 11 were dying in the noblest of all causes, Jihad, which is an incumbent religious duty, established in the Koran and in the Traditions as a divine institution, and enjoined for the purpose of advancing Islam. While suicide is forbidden, martyrdom is everywhere praised, welcomed, and urged: "By the Being in Whose Hand is my life, I love that I should be killed in the way of Allah; then I should be brought back to life and be killed again in His way..."; "The Prophet said, 'Nobody who enters Paradise will ever like to return to this world even if he were offered everything, except the martyr who will desire to return to this world and be killed 10 times for the sake of the great honour that has been bestowed upon him'." [Sahih Muslim, chapters 781, 782, The Merit of Jihad and the Merit of Martyrdom.]<br><br>What of the rewards in paradise? The Islamic paradise is described in great sensual detail in the Koran and the Traditions; for instance, Koran sura 56 verses 12 -40 ; sura 55 verses 54-56 ; sura 76 verses 12-22. I shall quote the celebrated Penguin translation by NJ Dawood of sura 56 verses 12- 39: "They shall recline on jewelled couches face to face, and there shall wait on them immortal youths with bowls and ewers and a cup of purest wine (that will neither pain their heads nor take away their reason); with fruits of their own choice and flesh of fowls that they relish. And theirs shall be the dark-eyed houris, chaste as hidden pearls: a guerdon for their deeds... We created the houris and made them virgins, loving companions for those on the right hand..."<br><br>One should note that most translations, even those by Muslims themselves such as A Yusuf Ali, and the British Muslim Marmaduke Pickthall, translate the Arabic (plural) word Abkarun as virgins, as do well-known lexicons such the one by John Penrice. I emphasise this fact since many pudic and embarrassed Muslims claim there has been a mistranslation, that "virgins" should be replaced by "angels". In sura 55 verses 72-74, Dawood translates the Arabic word " hur " as "virgins", and the context makes clear that virgin is the appropriate translation: "Dark-eyed virgins sheltered in their tents (which of your Lord's blessings would you deny?) whom neither man nor jinnee will have touched before." The word hur occurs four times in the Koran and is usually translated as a "maiden with dark eyes".<br><br>Two points need to be noted. First, there is no mention anywhere in the Koran of the actual number of virgins available in paradise, and second, the dark-eyed damsels are available for all Muslims, not just martyrs. It is in the Islamic Traditions that we find the 72 virgins in heaven specified: in a Hadith (Islamic Tradition) collected by Al-Tirmidhi (died 892 CE [common era*]) in the Book of Sunan (volume IV, chapters on The Features of Paradise as described by the Messenger of Allah [Prophet Muhammad], chapter 21, About the Smallest Reward for the People of Paradise, (Hadith 2687). The same hadith is also quoted by Ibn Kathir (died 1373 CE ) in his Koranic commentary (Tafsir) of Surah Al-Rahman (55), verse 72: "The Prophet Muhammad was heard saying: 'The smallest reward for the people of paradise is an abode where there are 80,000 servants and 72 wives, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine, and ruby, as wide as the distance from Al-Jabiyyah [a Damascus suburb] to Sana'a [Yemen]'."<br><br>Modern apologists of Islam try to downplay the evident materialism and sexual implications of such descriptions, but, as the Encyclopaedia of Islam says, even orthodox Muslim theologians such as al Ghazali (died 1111 CE) and Al-Ash'ari (died 935 CE) have "admitted sensual pleasures into paradise". The sensual pleasures are graphically elaborated by Al-Suyuti (died 1505 ), Koranic commentator and polymath. He wrote: "Each time we sleep with a houri we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [ie Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetising vaginas."<br><br>One of the reasons Nietzsche hated Christianity was that it "made something unclean out of sexuality", whereas Islam, many would argue, was sex-positive. One cannot imagine any of the Church fathers writing ecstatically of heavenly sex as al-Suyuti did, with the possible exception of St Augustine before his conversion. But surely to call Islam sex-positive is to insult all Muslim women, for sex is seen entirely from the male point of view; women's sexuality is admitted but seen as something to be feared, repressed, and a work of the devil.<br><br>Scholars have long pointed out that these images are clearly drawn pictures and must have been inspired by the art of painting. Muhammad, or whoever is responsible for the descriptions, may well have seen Christian miniatures or mosaics representing the gardens of paradise and has interpreted the figures of angels rather literally as those of young men and young women. A further textual influence on the imagery found in the Koran is the work of Ephrem the Syrian [306-373 CE], Hymns on Paradise, written in Syriac, an Aramaic dialect and the language of Eastern Christianity, and a Semitic language closely related to Hebrew and Arabic.<br><br>This naturally leads to the most fascinating book ever written on the language of the Koran, and if proved to be correct in its main thesis, probably the most important book ever written on the Koran. Christoph Luxenberg's book, Die Syro-Aramaische Lesart des Koran, available only in German, came out just over a year ago, but has already had an enthusiastic reception, particularly among those scholars with a knowledge of several Semitic languages at Princeton, Yale, Berlin, Potsdam, Erlangen, Aix-en-Provence, and the Oriental Institute in Beirut.<br><br>Luxenberg tries to show that many obscurities of the Koran disappear if we read certain words as being Syriac and not Arabic. We cannot go into the technical details of his methodology but it allows Luxenberg, to the probable horror of all Muslim males dreaming of sexual bliss in the Muslim hereafter, to conjure away the wide-eyed houris promised to the faithful in suras XLIV.54; LII.20, LV.72, and LVI.22. Luxenberg 's new analysis, leaning on the Hymns of Ephrem the Syrian, yields "white raisins" of "crystal clarity" rather than doe-eyed, and ever willing virgins - the houris. Luxenberg claims that the context makes it clear that it is food and drink that is being offerred, and not unsullied maidens or houris.<br><br>In Syriac, the word hur is a feminine plural adjective meaning white, with the word "raisin" understood implicitly. Similarly, the immortal, pearl-like ephebes or youths of suras such as LXXVI.19 are really a misreading of a Syriac expression meaning chilled raisins (or drinks) that the just will have the pleasure of tasting in contrast to the boiling drinks promised the unfaithful and damned.<br><br>As Luxenberg's work has only recently been published we must await its scholarly assessment before we can pass any judgements. But if his analysis is correct then suicide bombers, or rather prospective martyrs, would do well to abandon their culture of death, and instead concentrate on getting laid 72 times in this world, unless of course they would really prefer chilled or white raisins, according to their taste, in the next.<br><br>Â· Common era is an alternative to Christian era as a method of historical dating<br></div>
