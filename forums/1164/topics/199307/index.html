            <div class='col-md body'>Yes the BMP-3 is amphibous. This vehicle is one of the best in the market for its amphibious capability. Most if not all Russian armoured vehicles are amphibous.<br><br>It have superior firepower. A 100mm gun which can fire ATGM, a 30mm cannon and three 7.62 machine guns. Not to mention that it is cheap as compared to its Western counterparts as well. Many developing countries are using it. A NATO country is known to use it,Greece. Another modern country which uses it is South Korea for the marines.<br><br>The downside is that the weapons and ammo is different from what we are already using,this may be a problem for logistics. The armour is also known to be weak by Western standards but this can be rectified by upgrades which the Singapore defence industry is capable of.<br><br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bmp-3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bmp-3/</a></div>

It is not considered a tank on a strict sense although it's firepower is close.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However, this way we will be unable to have the superior firepower present on the original BMP-3 turret.<br><br>I am thinking if the South Koreans who use predominantly US weapons can have the BMP-3 in their marines i am sure we can work things out as well. Anyway we only need to replace 44 AMX-10 (of which half is the heavily armed variant), so we can standardise to using all  BMP-3 instead of 2 variants but have a lesser number as compared to the original 44. This way we will have superior firepower and better amphibous capability at a fraction of the cost of purchasing some Western vehicle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>PS. equlus84 i am interested in this Spike and 30mm turret which you have mentioned do you have any pics and info?

All we need is to construct 2 types of turrets, one for the role as a 'tank' and one for the role as a IFV. But armour wise will need some improvement. Weight will also be an issue due to the addition of a turret and armour but this can be solved by having a more powerful engine.
