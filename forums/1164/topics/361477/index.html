              Oh you mean North Korea shoot a nuclear missile to US and they also fires them in response? North Korea has missiles that will reach west US...
              
              So when US fires those missiles aiming for North Korea...Russia, China which detects incoming nuclear missiles will also fires them in response?
              
              Like the last portion of the video, every country which have nuclear missiles just fired them? :o

              <p>Hi Mr. Tyrannosaur - the dinosaurs (name sounds familiar ha ha ) were most likely taken out by a massive asteroid hit on earth many millions years ago.  The cause of the extinction was due to the collateral damage in the form of the asteroid impact throwing up debris &amp; blanketing earth leading to climate changes &amp; making life not sustainable to the dinosaurs.</p>
              <p>Here we are talking about not only the great firepower of a nuclear explosion but more importantly the massive atomic rediation &amp; its ensuing side effects on human health, mutation of cells &amp; changes in the earth's ecology &amp; environment.  Another point is that asteroid impacts are acts of God &amp; beyond human control but nukes are man made.</p>

              <p>You are restating my point basically. Nuclear warfare will probably end human civilization as we know it, and possibly lead to human extinction, but life itself on earth is pretty safe.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of life forms that can tolerate far more radiation then we can, and the mutations caused by radiation from fallout will lead to selective pressure towards organisms that are more tolerant towards such an event.</p>
              <p>To note case in point, in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, where massive amounts of radiation were released, the areas most affected by fallout were feared by scientists to be unable to support any form of life, but 20 years on the wildlife in the area seems to have carried out far better then expected. There were some disturbing mutations though, and you probably shouldn't go hunting for meat there... but practically it seems that nature in itself is a lot more hardy to such disasters then we are.</p>

              <p>Not very likely... I do not think the world's suppy of nukes will be able to melt our ice caps. We don't have anywhere near that amount of firepower.</p>
              <p>In any case even if ALL of our ice caps melted there will still be plenty of land left around, though costal areas will be pretty much underwater.

              <p>No, no we are not simple lifeforms. We are very complex life forms indeed.</p>
              <p>However, complexity also implies a lack of ability to adapt. For example, our computers are very complex products. But it operates on the assumption that there is electricity to power it, without electricity it is just a hunk of metal. With increased processing power, it needs more power to function.</p>
              <p>Homo sapiens evolved and gained our current complexity based on the assumption that there is enough energy to be consumed for us to breed. Meaning a clean and stable supply of water and food. We also need a varied diet in order to be able to be healthy enough to live decently.</p>
              <p>A nuclear disaster would disrupt that supply, without it humans and its associated civilisation would also cease to function. Much the same way the dinosaurs.</p>
              <p>In contrast, simplier lifeforms such as cockroaches are not so dependant on what they eat and can survive for quite a long time without food.</p>
              <p>We may think we are the product of eons of evolution. But so were the dinosaurs. And they have been on this planet hell of a lot longer than we have. And considering the way we're treating the planet i doubt we could break their record.</p>
