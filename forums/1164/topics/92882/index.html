            <div class='col-md body'>isn't a flagship one where the naval admiral commands the fleet from? that's why the 7th fleet's flag ship is the blue ridge. its a pure command vessal. and thus the phrase "transferring the flag" when the admiral's ship is going down. in WW2, when the admiral's carrier was sinking, he could transfer the flag over to a cruiser, and it effectively becomes the flag ship...</div>

The senior most commander or the task group leader will at sea in command. But no need for speical "flag ship".<br><br>One of the things that Nimitz did after Pearl Harbour is to transfer his "flag" ashore. His "flag ship" the BB Pennsinaia (spelling) was damaged.
