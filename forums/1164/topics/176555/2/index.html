            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks MyVi for your picture it really clears all doubt about the origin of this unknown vessel. Maybe we can have more amateur photographers taking pics and posting it here. Its kind of fun and intresting to go guessing what it is and where it came from with only a low quality picture! For course please don't take or reveal anything which have the faintest chance of compromising our own national security.

            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely Indonesian.  We've seen pics of their vessels before in articles about how the 3 navies are co-operating to patrol the Malacca straits.  If its not meant to be there, RSN would've chased it away long ago.  Our waters aren't that large &amp; besides its kinda hard for a 3G Navy to miss a vessel of that size.</div>

I listed the armament fit of the first six ships below... The other six ships are similarly equipped abeit without torpedo armament.<br><br>Guns:<br>1 x OtoBreda 76mm<br>2 x CIS-50 12.7mm HMG<br><br>Missiles:<br>Mistral SAM / Twin Launcher<br><br>Torpedoes:<br>Whitehead A244/S 324mm / 2 Triple Launchers<br><br>I feel that these ships, modern in design and electronics as they are, are still unable to handle more potent threats. The 5.3km range of the Mistral for instance does not give the ship adequate air defence capability. It is noteworthy that the Mistral is optimized for the anti-aircraft role and its effectiveness against incoming ASMs is probably marginal.<br><br>The Whitehead A244/S is a very competent weapon, however it should be noted that this weapon is employed on the major combatants of certain European navies only as a protection against submarines, given that they come equipped with ASW helicopters and a full spectrum of weapon systems meant for the offensive role. I find it extremely disturbing that the first six units of the Fearless class are designated "Anti-submarine PVs", yet are armed only with lightweight torpedoes. For such a specialized role torpedoes of calibre 400mm or even 533mm are necessary given their longer range and higher lethality, taking into account that most submarines have weapons that far outrange the A244/S.<br><br>Hopefully the RSN would address these problems in the future with the replacement of the existing weapon fit with robust systems such as the German DM2A4 533mm torpedoes (on order for Vastergotland SSKs) and Barak I SAMs (in service on Victory FSGs).<br><br></div>

The blade count, speed, perhaps engine noise.  Such information MAY reveal the type of vessel, if the relevant information was already available before.  Like perhaps stored in some archive.<br><br>Some ships may have similar acoustics signatures, and are very difficult to tell apart.  So the most reliable way to ID it, is to look at it thru the periscope.</div>
