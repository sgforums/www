            <div class='col-md body'>1. With rgs to public transport , it gets crowded during peak hours.<br><br>2. Gets Real smelly and dirty and cramped.<br><br>3.

Threat of Al-Qaeda and terrorists , as you can see from 1995 Tokyo Sarin<br>Subway gas attack , people will die , so i rather not take the chance<br>although i got confidence in the government.<br><br>5. Respect from women , society is constantly evolving and changing<br>with rgds to it , Women will demand that thier husband have 5c etc etc<br>so..We guys no choice , havta do it<br><br>with regards to costs , i believe the problem can be eventually solved ,<br>lets see , if we can get complete 100% technology transfer by then in about<br>year 2060 =D .<br><br>Yes i do want to ride a 100% locally built fighter jet in the future national days to come , and stop being bullied by neighbouring countries like M'sia<br>and we keep on getting flak everyyear but nevertheless , our Foreign ministry have been very tolerant of them. With a superior locally built fighter , i believe<br>that we can promote patriotism , instead of forcefully incalculating them in school students like in secondary school and catching students for not singing national anthem.<br><br>Sure we may get a F-35 JSF and etc etc..even as a low level participant , lets say U.S.A always like that..dowan share source codes for the jet fighter , then buy a plane for what? cause we need the source codes for upgrading ..<br>My only hope of course is to see singapore being well defended ,<br>yes i know defense do come at a cost , but i also don't wanna risk being<br>"qiao zha" .<br><br>The idea of starting this topic is this, if we can get a fighter jet , either by producing locally or build it together , we can get spare parts and do D.I.Y<br>and in case you all do not know , some americans in their congress last time has complained about singapore as in lacking of human rights and protest against FTA , just imagine if people there in U.S.A in the future says SG got no proper elections etc..then ties might be affected . Furthermore USA has been known to sell those stuffs which are 2nd rated 1..that means the F-16 C/D USAF 's 1 configuration is more better then SG's F-16 C/D configuration .<br>Some special stuff like AESA radar thier planes got but we don't hab &gt;.&lt;<br><br>Friends friends also like this 1....in this world..who can we really count on??<br><br>Pal i certainly do have considered the possibility of doing it , and i know that fighter jet is much tougher to build in comparison , hey but you forgot one important thing . Temasak holdings has a $52,000,000,000 portfolio .<br>or $52 billion =D or should i say ..rough 1/4 of the National Reserves<br><br>Other stuffs which im trying to identify with regards is..<br>The purchasing of engines like F404 ...and assemble a fighter plane by ourselves , to put in simpler terms to computer gurus..buying all the HDD and all the RAM and assemble it into a computer.<br><br>If we can do it cheaper and better , we can even sell it to other countries ,<br>cut down our tax rate from 22% FY 2004 to even like 18% for FY 2005<br><br>Everyone in SG benefits , and furthermore money goes back into our own pocket . =D . if we can detach a A-4 and put it all back . Why can't we do so for other planes?<br><br>Even our Bionix is locally aseembled. Delta Frigate is also locally assembled in ST Marine jurong Shipyard.</div>
