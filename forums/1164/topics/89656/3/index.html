No one understand you any more.<br><br>Common sense, if mass purchase of audi can be done, mass purchase of nissan sunny can also be done will be even super cheaper !!! This prove you cannot even do calculation !<br><br>You shoot yourself again, when we mention road jam in war is within singapore, people will be out looking for their love ones, phonelines are jammed or dead, like the blackout, accidents.  You the so call future pilot, what was your thoughts ? Your shameful thought is of driving your damn audi across the crossway, not to camp, bravo now everyone know who the goddamn traitor who in future will take just $1000 to sell information.<br><br>I am not wasting any more time talking to you on this posting. As you became insane in your thoughts.</div>

Its like driving into Nazi Hitler Germany in WWII with Luftwaffe flying over you.<br><br>Why would i be a dog of them? when i got a family here and children and friends here?<br><br>with regards to audi , the SAF has already arranged a standard price for the mass purchase of 80 audis , which is sold at a price.<br><br>And furthermore , officers are needed to be distinguished in times of war ,<br>so many nissan sunny(s) on the road , how you expect them to know?<br>MID****X ? through car plate? With regards to officers , we already have given them car so why the high salary somemore? Lower abit for our NS man also cannot meh?<br><br>yeah yeah people will b looking for loved ones. THAT if it is sudden warfare ,<br>there are 2 types of war , blitkrieg and a war which come out through tension etc..<br><br>In a Blitz , probably what you mentioned might happen .<br><br>but in a war which has started through tension , people will probably be in SCDF , and in a bomb shelter safely.<br><br>Sitting in a car is a very dumb move . Why? protected by a less then thin sheet of metal? I believe people here have something called common sense and logic. Between 10 metres of concrete and a less then 1cm of thin metal , who and what would you choose ?<br><br>Even during a wartime most likely it will occur at night time , and last time if you all remember at night time during Battle of Britain , when there is bombing going on by the Luftwaffe , people were advised to shut out their lights in their house so that the german fighters cannot find their way.<br><br>So by driving and having ur headlights ON , enemy tanks just need to open fire with their 120 mm cannon and "pound" your DEAD!<br><br>You keep on dismissing me as a spy or whatsoever.<br>Just to tell you , You are completely ignoring the possibility of having spies in SAF . If i have to tell you , ISD has kept records of foreign spies operating in SG. Do pay them a visit if you have a time . =)<br><br>And we also donno 1 of the person in SAF might sell information to Country A , because of poor loyalties.<br><br>I believe the only good friend of us , is only Country X .<br>Why ? Even our so-called abang oso mai help us , after kicking us out =)</div>
