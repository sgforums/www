            <div class='col-md body'>do you have any idea how incredibly expensive it is to design and build a fighter these days? japan, the richest and most advanced country in asia took almost 10years to design and produce their f16 spinoff. the lavi and ching kuo fighters are only comparitively simple ground attack and support planes. even the US took more than a decade to get their f22s rolling out from the factory. and the cost? astronomical.<br><br>the only reasons why taiwan and isreal resorted to desgining their own stuff is because they faced total blackout of supplies. and china's reaction to taiwans' fighters? buy more sukhois. so unless you wanna start arms race and deplete singapore's monetary resources just to get a support aircraft, i'd rather we continue looking overseas.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my previous suggestions..<br>we could be a more involved partner<br>rather den a low level partner in the JSF..<br><br>alot of the new hi-technologies stuffs in the JSF is out of bounds<br>and furthermore..who is gonna tell us the source codes..<br>and provide the more powerful radar??<br><br>America has been known to withheld key technologies to ally<br>for example..they were close to selling F-117 to their closest ally..<br>the british..<br><br>America has always been known to have the best FORM of aircraft technology..<br>so by suggesting we create a aircraft with other countries..<br>like how eurofighter works..<br><br>Why can't we do it?? EuroFighter faced so many problems and F-15 T<br>and ...rafale...<br><br>Regarding cost..we can even spent so much $$ on developing stealth warship<br>and the technology required to develop stealth warships is much tougher as well.<br><br>ST engineering can develop SHIPS,TANKS,UAV..but not planes..despite planes supplying the bulk of revenue..WE CAN UPGRADE,MAINTENANCE..but can't BUILD!<br><br>but it would definitely be in our best interest..coz the technology we can have our own and we will gain another level in aircraft research..<br><br>JUST IMAGINE IF CHINA IS USA..AND LHL JUST OFFEND THEM..we would HAVE LOST PLENTY OF SPARE PARTS..??!!<br><br>and being a purchaser of the american jets..we must always be friendly towards them..or else we will be marked in thier foreign policy..<br><br>as the foreign ministry has stated...WE ARE A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY!<br><br>Everything in NDP is perfect..the local stadium..local president..local built tanks<br>local modified a4-su..american-made F-16..<br><br>i do know that many countries parade their f-16..but in the near future..<br>don't you wanna have a fighter plane which ur country co-developed??<br><br>like the british tornado? or french mirage? or israel lavi ? or taiwan IDF<br>or japanese F-2 or zero fighters? or german me propeller fighters?<br>or maybe even indonesian cn-225?<br><br>we may never be comparable..BUT..we can at least participate as a higher lvl participating country..just as i said..some pple in the military field would also know that country-x would not also pass us some key technologies..<br><br>Why not we be the one?<br>a small country like us could build so many stuffs..<br><br>adapted from ndp song..<br>"Lets show the world what singapore can be, we can achieve, we can achieve"<br><br>its only a fighter jet..pal , they can buy sukhois for all they care..<br>whatever will happen will happen, they might use arms race as a excuse..<br><br>with the new fighter jets, doesn't mean we have to do everything from scratch. =)<br><br>our engineers and technicians KNOW A-4 so well..<br>like the back of our hand..i bet we know the A-4 even better den the americans do..<br><br>we already have dunno how many times....overhauled the aircraft, upgrade and observed the A-4 and F-5 engine and the body..<br><br>Look at the spare parts..i don't think even singapore can manufacture the f-16 spare parts..<br><br>JUST imagine another case like michael fay happens..<br>and our F-16 stuff is..<br><br>Blame me for fiercely patriotic..<br>But i really don't see any future with rafale EUROFIGHTER AND F-15 T!<br><br>all of those companies just wanna make a quick buck from us<br>why not we let our own pple make the $$?<br><br>isn't it better?? contribute to our economy..GDP..JOBS....<br>GIVE dsta work to do somemore<br><br>imagine how much we lose if we outsource the work..<br><br>Singapore could like provide electronics..plane shell..<br>den israel provide weaponry integrations and radar..<br>taiwan and japan could probably..do the rest..<br><br>or get some pple from Non-aligned movement to partner us..<br><br>brunei could also fund the project..TW's fighter plane project costs 4.5billion++ in first few stages..<br><br>just imagine the sultan himself almost as rich as bill gates who has 40 billion..<br>we just get him to invest 2 bn and deliver say..30 jets..and train them up..<br><br>All this remains a hypothesis..but when there's a will there's a way..<br><br>Hope our  new PM can read this posting =D<br><br>Look overseas??

Just imagine, we can only spare enough to be a low-level JSF partner, what makes you think we have the financial ability to develope a fighter of the same calibre?

            <div class='col-md body'>Development costs will be astronomical. Our own requirements will be small, not like Taiwan or Japan where their own Air Forces require a few hundred. Even if we were to use our own fighter for all squadrons, it'll come up to no more than 100+ units. And that is plain stupid because you're basically hedging all your eggs in 1 basket. A fighter development needs sufficient orders to make it economically viable, if you knew what economies of scale is, you'll know what it means, which is quite obvious you don't.<br><br>If you knew what's inside our "indigenious" products, you'll realise almost all are 3rd party manufacture and even COTS items.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SibeiSuayKia:</div><div class="quote_body">F-2 facing problems coz its smaller in size..<br>and not enough platforms given to upgrade itself..<br><br></div></blockquote>F-2 smaller than F-16? You're out of your mind. Its bigger, a lot costlier and not much of a leap over the F-16s capabilities. If you bothered to read the link you've posted you'll see that building a "indigenious" fighter to satisfy nationalist whims is an instant ticket to breaking the bank.<br><br>Which comes back to the fact that you don't understand economics or economies of scale.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Cut down military general's salary.<br>2. Review the need of forward defense.<br>3. Check if planes based in foreign country is really feasible , how fast can arrive back , for example , if the pilot flying back say 12 hours..he would be really tired and a 2nd pilot come take over..and regarding foreign bases..<br>whether we could use to strike enemy places..and whether we can gain access for airspace to pass through if such a need arises<br>4.Purchases<br><br>A. 10 Hovercrafts which is capable of cruising fast armed with mistral and a high speed of 40 knots with reactive armour plating , titanium shield blocking<br>the front of the turbofan , capable of transporting 12 Bionix Tanks<br>B. 20 Chinooks which has upgraded engine to travel faster and insert<br>all the commandos<br>C. Delta Frigates which has faster speed and can deploy mini rockets<br>to counter Astros<br>D. Scorpene submarine with a option to launch missiles thru the vertical tube inside.<br>E.

INCREASED pay for all NS-Mans about $800 . using the cut-down pay<br>from the high rankers.<br>O. cut down reservice training , NS man training down to 20 months<br>more tougher , special programs to help NS man to get back to society<br>after 20 months<br>P. Higher quality of fighter planes = lower amount of military man needed<br>Q. People can choose to pay $$ to the military and evade NS<br>say pay $50,000 SGD<br>- Long Range Missiles<br>- A-10 warthogs , no apache (faster speed )<br>- armour for all LSVs<br>- portable bullet proofs vests for all ns man..<br>wearing of the green uniform into battle is too lightly protected..<br>should have a light sort of kevlar to carry into jungle warfare<br>at least higher chances of survival<br>- more medics<br>- more spies<br>- 1/2 jungle warfare /  1/2 urban warfare<br>- Ground strike aircraft more , more C-4 explosions and special technics<br>to distract enemy , research into powerful bombs to destroy<br>hardened aircraft shelters<br><br>once again i must stress,  we must be able to obtain the secrets of fighter technology from them, one day if ever the world don't like us..<br>we can supply ourselves..<br><br>and 1 more stuff i suggest we claim all the southern islands together<br></div>
