It's not a case of us questioning the same (very questionable) views or statements because we agree - it's that we agree because we both find the statements questionable.  If you say or write something that flies in the face of objectivity, those who see things objectively will of course have similar things to say about your view, since the objective truth acts as a common reference point.  On the other hand, if you are basing your claims only on your subjective view, unless someone shares the same warped view as you, you are unlikely to garner agreement.</div></blockquote>i'm not here to get ppl to agreed with mi, as i'm not running for the next election, i'm just trying to tell u not to be so small air and whatever is said in other thread should stay there, stop making references and personal attack, i hope u get what i mean, and which are the previous thread that we dun see eyes to eyes with, if ppl dun agreed with your view, just let it be, dun harp on it, ok thanks<br><br>[/quote][/b]I don't know where you got your idea of how this forum is moderated, but the moderators here uphold the sgForums commandments and do not act as arbiters of truth.  As Nathan (who is not a relative or fan of mine either - in fact until the last few days I haven't seen him around much recently) notes, if you feel you are free to post your views without any form of explanation or sunstantiation, we are equally free to question, dissect, examine, deconstruct, analyse, and ultimately derive our amusement from hokey ideas put on this forum[/b][/quote]<br><br>yes feel free to post whatever u want on my "hokey" or "warped' idea, its your rights, i dun give a damn to it.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br>In the same fell swoop, while you accuse others of ganging up, you're trying to start a community movement yourself, by painting yourself as defender of jacobs and gary - I'm sure you must have heard you use the word hypocrite used around you before.<br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>well i don't agreed with u on this, as i'm now not trying to defend them or getting them to help mi out, just that i dun see the point of u and heng pulling out those cheap 1 2 on them. most of the time not related to on the topic at all.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br>Besides, gary is doing well enough for himself - posters are disagreeing with him but nobody is attacking him because he actually builds some objectivity into his posts and knows how to properly handle ideas that he knows are subjective.  As for jacobs, read the thread carefully and you will see that he introduced the word "idiot" into the conversation - he called himself names, and I just agreed.<br>[/b][/quote]<br>even if he's the one that start it, by calling him names yourself... doesnt that make u no diff with him?? but if u enjoy it.. so be it.. not my problem..<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br>As for yourself, you've got this habit of saying something and then running away from it. I honestly don't know if you're just trying to get attention or lack the capacity to take an idea all the way through to its bitter end, or whether it's the forum equivalent of the old "burning paper bag full of dogsh*t" gag.  In any case, I'm here to tell you that that dog just don't hunt.<br>So you see, you just don't have a leg to stand on here.  You deserve neither respect nor pity.  Put yourself up to be pilloried, and you surely will be pilloried.[/b][/quote]<br><br>attention is actually something i dun like in real life so i wont be seeking it here, as for the "running away" u are talking about, well if ppl dun not agreed to my point and started getting crappy and personal do u think there a need to reply?? and like i have said earlier ppl have they rights to post their views, and diff ppl have diff views. i dun have a habit of cornering ppl just to prove i am right, i can take no as an answer no problem with that at all..just ignore it and move on.<br><br>so u can choose to ignore my warped idea now or reply with your long essay, which i will just ignore. it's really up to u, i am not here to get personal and make enemy. :<br></div>

After all, you don't give a damn, do you?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I-like-flings(m):</div><div class="quote_body">even if he's the one that start it, by calling him names yourself... doesnt that make u no diff with him?? but if u enjoy it.. so be it.. not my problem.. </div></blockquote>First, you obviously don't read too well - HE called HIMSELF an idiot.  I just agreed with him.  Second, if it's not your problem, why even mention it?  Again, you're doing the running away bit.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by I-like-flings(m):</div><div class="quote_body">and like i have said earlier ppl have they rights to post their views, and diff ppl have diff views. i dun have a habit of cornering ppl just to prove i am right, i can take no as an answer no problem with that at all..just ignore it and move on.<br><br>so u can choose to ignore my warped idea now or reply with your long essay, which i will just ignore. it's really up to u, i am not here to get personal and make enemy. : </div></blockquote>So why did you write the post I've been quoting from?</div>
