It's not a case of us questioning the same (very questionable) views or statements because we agree - it's that we agree because we both find the statements questionable.  If you say or write something that flies in the face of objectivity, those who see things objectively will of course have similar things to say about your view, since the objective truth acts as a common reference point.  On the other hand, if you are basing your claims only on your subjective view, unless someone shares the same warped view as you, you are unlikely to garner agreement.<br><br>I don't know where you got your idea of how this forum is moderated, but the moderators here uphold the sgForums commandments and do not act as arbiters of truth.  As Nathan (who is not a relative or fan of mine either - in fact until the last few days I haven't seen him around much recently) notes, if you feel you are free to post your views without any form of explanation or sunstantiation, we are equally free to question, dissect, examine, deconstruct, analyse, and ultimately derive our amusement from hokey ideas put on this forum.<br><br>In the same fell swoop, while you accuse others of ganging up, you're trying to start a community movement yourself, by painting yourself as defender of jacobs and gary - I'm sure you must have heard you use the word hypocrite used around you before.<br><br>Besides, gary is doing well enough for himself - posters are disagreeing with him but nobody is attacking him because he actually builds some objectivity into his posts and knows how to properly handle ideas that he knows are subjective.  As for jacobs, read the thread carefully and you will see that he introduced the word "idiot" into the conversation - he called himself names, and I just agreed.<br><br>As for yourself, you've got this habit of saying something and then running away from it. I honestly don't know if you're just trying to get attention or lack the capacity to take an idea all the way through to its bitter end, or whether it's the forum equivalent of the old "burning paper bag full of dogsh*t" gag.  In any case, I'm here to tell you that that dog just don't hunt.<br><br>So you see, you just don't have a leg to stand on here.  You deserve neither respect nor pity.  Put yourself up to be pilloried, and you surely will be pilloried.</div>
