            <div class='col-md body'>Well, actually its a miss communication thingie.  You see, back then 2 neighbouring countries were supposed to be conducting their joint excercise together and apparently communications of the going-ons failed to reach our country in time so thats why they thought and we think.<br><br>There was a another case not from our country when aircraft from a US carrier were deployed and nearly had to open fire at indonesian aircraft sent to intercept them.  Apparently, the US had sent word earlier that their carrier was passing thru indo waters but news had not reach in time due to admin lapses.  In addition diplomatic ties back then were strained.  So you can figure the rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Motive behind misreading of book on SAF<br>by David Boey<br><br>BILATERAL ties between Singapore and Malaysia have gone through a bad patch<br>lately, with verbal spats turning distinctly belligerent. Malaysian Foreign<br>Minister Syed Hamid Albar said on Dec 31 last year: 'Singapore has two choices:<br>If it refuses to compromise, go to war.'<br><br>Adding to the strain were reports in Malaysian newspapers that used extracts<br>from a book by British academic Tim Huxley, titled Defending The Lion City: The<br>Armed Forces Of Singapore, out of context.<br><br>Dr Huxley supervised my master's dissertation on Singapore's defence policy<br>when I studied at the University of Hull in England several years ago. The<br>preface of his contentious book cites a Singaporean journalist who 'contributed<br>substantially to my knowledge of the subject'.<br><br>I am the journalist mentioned. I will point out later how his book has been<br>misread. But first, some comments on Singapore-Malaysia political<br>brinkmanship.<br><br>A similarly tense period occurred in 1991 when Malaysia and Indonesia staged<br>joint military manoeuvres, code-named Exercise Malindo Darsasa 3AB, on<br>peninsular Malaysia from July to August. This was then the largest military<br>exercise between Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>The highlight of the exercise involved dropping paratroops in southern Johor,<br>just 18 km from Singapore's border. The airborne landing site was just minutes<br>away by car from the Causeway.<br><br>From Singapore's perspective, the exercise was seen as a deliberate ploy to<br>test how the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) would react to a large-scale military<br>exercise on its doorstep.<br><br>And lest Singapore's defence planners missed the message, the airdrop was<br>codenamed Pukul Habis (Malay for 'Total Wipeout'). It was also executed with<br>unprecedented proximity to Singapore on Aug 9 - Singapore's National Day.<br><br>MOBILISATION<br><br>SINGAPORE responded by launching an Open Mobilisation Exercise at 5.30 pm on<br>National Day eve. In those pre-Internet days, the exercise was widely<br>publicised on Singapore's television and radio news on Aug 8 and received Page<br>One treatment in local newspapers on Aug 9 - the day on which the Pukul Habis<br>airdrop took place.<br><br>Fast forward to Sunday, Jan 26, 2003. The SAF conducts its second Open Mobex<br>for 2003. This was barely a fortnight after the year's first Open Mobex on Jan<br>11.<br><br>Since Singapore's first Open Mobex was held on July 8, 1985, there have been<br>only two instances when Mindef held such exercises twice in the same month - in<br>June 1987 and in May 1988.<br><br>The latest mobilisation was notable as it was held one day after Foreign<br>Minister S. Jayakumar made his landmark parliamentary speech on<br>Singapore-Malaysia relations.<br><br>The drill also coincided with Malaysia's apparent bid that same weekend to hike<br>up military activity in Johor. After weeks of provocative talk, the Malaysians<br>used a Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) career expo in Johor to display some of the<br>MAF's firepower.<br><br>The SAF rarely mobilises troops on a Sunday. And when it accords full media<br>coverage for the exercise, one can sense that Singapore's Ministry of Defence<br>(Mindef) wants its deterrent message heard loud and clear.<br><br>The Open Mobex publicity, when augmented with moves to quietly enhance the<br>SAF's defence readiness, represents a carefully-controlled, measured approach<br>to warn outsiders of Singapore's readiness to deal with military<br>contingencies.<br><br>Singapore cannot allow itself to be desensitised to bellicose talk or hyped-up<br>military activity close to its border. If it chooses not to respond to such<br>unneighbourly activity, Singapore risks sending a signal that war-like remarks<br>will be tolerated - or worse, that the city-state has been cowed into silence -<br>everytime the tone of language used breaches accepted behaviour among erstwhile<br>friends.<br><br>Now back to Dr Huxley's contentious book.<br><br>The book is not new. It was published in early 2000 and has since gone through<br>five print runs of 2,000 copies each. When it first hit the bookshelves, it<br>attracted hardly any attention in the Malaysian media or academic community.<br><br>Defence watchers should also note that the Johor scenario - that the SAF would<br>invade Johor and defeat the MAF in a matter of hours - is not new either. Dr<br>Huxley first published his thoughts on this scenario way back in 1991 in an<br>article in The Pacific Review titled 'Singapore and Malaysia: A Precarious<br>Balance?'.<br><br>MISCHIEVOUS MOTIVE<br><br>IT'S fine to trawl up a two-year-old book to give a fresh spin to articles on<br>Singapore-Malaysia defence relations. But when a critical point in the analysis<br>is glossed over, one cannot help but start to doubt the motives of the<br>writers.<br><br>That critical point concerns the SAF's strategy of deterrence.<br><br>At no point in the book did Dr Huxley conclude that the SAF would be used as an<br>occupation force in a war of conquest.<br><br>To suggest what the author has not intended, or to perceive something that the<br>text clearly does not say, is mischievous and intellectually dishonest.<br><br>If this is the way Malaysian commentators react to what I and others think is<br>an impartial study on the SAF, then Singaporeans should brace themselves for<br>more fiery, yet lop-sided diatribes when new additions like AH-64D Apache<br>attack choppers, 155mm self-propelled heavy artillery and stealth frigates are<br>added to the SAF's arsenal in due course.<br><br>In his book, Dr Huxley spells out the strategy of deterrence clearly. He says:<br>'The key to understanding Singapore's strategy, though, is that the SAF's clear<br>capability to inflict severe damage on Malaysia (by implication, creating<br>serious political and economic repercussions for Singapore) is not intended to<br>be used. The capability is a deterrent - a sort of regional 'doomsday machine'<br>intended to manipulate Singapore's regional threat environment by forcing<br>neighbouring states to treat the city-state with a degree of respect and<br>caution which might otherwise be absent.'<br><br>It is ironic that the kinship Singapore values with Malaysia, which is perhaps<br>best underscored by the Malayan Tiger sharing pride of place with the Singapore<br>Lion on Singapore's Coat of Arms, has been so taken for granted in the frequent<br>games of political brinkmanship.<br><br>The writer is a Business Times correspondent.
