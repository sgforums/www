            <div class='col-md body'>Erm. .. You sure there is a Barak ER??????<br><br>Anyway, here are a couple of good sources of info for the Barak . ..its hard to find info on it.  ..somehow Israeli armaments don't make it big on the internet.. . .<br><br>http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/missile_systems/sea_missiles/barak/Barak.html<br><br>http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Barak.html<br><br>If not the barak, then how do you guys think the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow (sea version of AIM-7) will perform?  Note its much longer range but also larger size. . .<br><br>http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/rim-7.htm<br><br>The RIM-7P version sounds pretty good, especially I think most of the time, the most important target for these shipborne SAMs will be Anti-ship missiles, many of which will be sea-skimming to make them harder to detect. . .<br><br>Also check out the:<br><br>Aster 15<br>Aster 30<br><br>Note these might come on the new delta frigates, so it owuld not be a bad idea to arm all of RSN's ships with them in future.  Considering the great range of the Aster 30 (3km to 80km), but the 3 km will have to be covered by the guns though. . .You'll want a pretty large number of these aboard, read the FAS website, the Aster 30 missed by 4 meters, its very good, but probably not good enough to save your ship. . .<br><br>http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/missile/row/aster.htm<br><br>The above is basically ALL that I think should be considered from what I've seen so far. . .<br><br>Basically, I think they should equip the all the ships with a 32-cell VLS system for air defence, cos even if the ships are meant for coastal defence, Anti-ship missiles can still be fired at them, and they'll have nothing to shoot back unless they have CIWS, which RSN has never used and do not intend to use. . .</div>

Comparing to the Rapier , the VLS Barak require a much lesser land clearance to launch. This is essential for urban and Jungle hubbed Singapore.<br><br>In other threads , i did state abt having multiple static Barak Missile system in various stratigical points in Singapore (eg Camps , government nerve centres ) and some mobile launchers to be deployed overseas or around Singapore. I believe a network of Barak 16-cell SAMs around Singapore will provide adequete capacity to down most of the air threat in the region , while I-Hawk or heavier missile act as the front line.<br><br>Back to the topic , anyone in the Navy know y the Mindef still retain the Mistral or anyone have any idea how reliable the Mistral be in drowning sea-skimming missiles ?</div>

It is manually launch and u have to see the missile coming.... If the Mistral is to protect a ship designed for littoral defense , then are u trying to state that the MGBs are for littoral defense too.<br><br>The onli reason i can think of is that , the PVs and the MGBs will be accompanied by a MCV which will provide frontline defence agaisnt SSMs , however wont that increase the workload of our 6 MGBs???<br><br>The six celled launcher is better as it is controlled by infra-red carmera and target aqquisation device for all weather operation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ermh... i think it is ok lor...<br>they are to be phased out soon enuf...<br>furthermore RSN ship dun do mission alone right?<br>as a task force, i think the bigger brothers armed with barak should do the job well enuf in protecting the whole taskforce...<br>as for the mistral i think is for close interception on aircrafts...<br>by the way if barak radar cannot pick up the signature, all is gone..<br>if it does, the mistral units can have a rough bearing to point to...</div>

The fact is that the Mistral isnt reliable enough to down an imcoming missile and supersonic speed.<br><br>If wat u assume is correct , then isnt Mindef playing with luck. If there is no attack on the PVs , good for u. If there is an attack , god bless u?? Then wat abt our MGB which are the second combatant on our strike list , littoral defence??<br><br>One could argue that because their operation are escorted by the MCVs , thus a true-blue missile defence system ( which jus cost alittle bit more ) isnt needed. But lets say , all the PVs and MGBs are armed with 8 cellled Baraks , it will lower the workload of the MCVs which is an advantage. Isnt it???</div>
