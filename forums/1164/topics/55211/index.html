            <div class='col-md body'>This morning, two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) A-4 fighters were scrambled to intercept a civilian aircraft which was heading towards Singapore air space, after air traffic control authorities could not establish communication with the pilot. The aircraft was then escorted to land at Seletar Airport.<br><br>The civilian aircraft was a Portuguese-registered Beechcraft 33. The aircraft was piloted by a Portuguese national, Mr Faria E Mello. The pilot had filed flight plans to Seletar Airport. However, there was a total electrical failure on board and the aircraft had lost radio contact with air traffic control.<br><br>Mr Mello has been released after questioning by the police.<br><br>In the current security environment, the Republic of Singapore Air Force would continue to maintain a high state of readiness.<br><br>-- source MINDEF</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this evening about 6:30pm, i happend to saw a few f-5, a-4 and a f-16d landing at paya lebar. i look up to scan the sky and found a fighter in formation with a larger aircraft. it was soon join by a c-130 and  4 fighters which took off from paya lebar. i think the large aircraft most probable was the kc-135. i think  they were doing some refueling exercise at 10000ft.</div>

It did not say where the plane was coming from.<br><br>Mr Mello was released after questioning by police, the ministry said.<br><br>Singapore is on alert after the arrests of over 30 alleged operatives of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terror network since 2001.<br><br>The group, said to be the South-east Asian wing of al-Qaeda, had plotted to bomb the US embassy, a US Naval base and the main Changi Airport.<br><br>The ministry said: 'In the current security environment, the Republic of Singapore Air Force will continue to maintain a high state of readiness.' -- AP<br></div>

A-4SUs, F-5s, F-16s and C-130s have been involved.<br><br>As for why it was the A-4SU and not F-5/F-16 thats involved in today's intercept, its not hard to figure out.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiya......just emergency scramble only lah.....done too many times oredi. I had also even seen a pilot praying in the cockpit during a scramble at EOR (end of runway) while the other pilot wasn't even stressed. The alert is a weekly activity so don't be shocked when u see planes chasing something in the air. My worst scramble was during 1998 Tanjong Pagar crisis with Malaysia. I won't elaborate what happen but people should know at that time, SG's relationship with MY is very bad. But luckily, nothing happened.....phew. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Flying by torchlight: pilot's harrowing flight to Seletar<br><br>By K.C. Vijayan<br><br>THREE hours after flying out of Colombo, the power failed in Captain Faria e Mello's plane.<br><br>Not only did his instruments go dead, but the cabin was in pitch-black darkness and he had to hold his torchlight in his mouth to see the instrument panel.<br><br>As he entered Singapore airspace, he decided it was safe to circle over an open area in the north-east of the island to manually engage the landing gear.<br><br>'With one hand on the controls, I reached out with my left hand to crank a lever on the cockpit floor and I had to rotate this 52 times in order to get the landing gear open,' he said. The task that would have taken mere seconds with power, took about 10 minutes manually.<br><br>What he failed to realise was that the open area he was circling over was a highly sensitive military installation - the Republic of Singapore Air Force's Tengah Air Base.<br><br>Suddenly, two fully armed A4 Super Skyhawk jets appeared alongside. The jets were scrambled because the electrical failure made it impossible for him to contact air-traffic control.<br><br>Said Capt Mello: 'I thought they were there to greet me and already knew that my plane was in distress.'<br><br>'So I did not pay much attention to them and carried on with the low level flight path to Seletar.'<br><br>He landed at about 9am, about 10 minutes before his long-time friend Capt Delfim Costa also touched down in a second plane that had been shadowing him on a round-the-world trip that has taken them from Portugal to Greece, Djibouti and Seychelles, before their last stop in Colombo.<br><br>They had been flying 10 minutes apart along the same route at about 150kmh on the Colombo to Singapore leg when the power failed on Capt Mello's single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza.<br><br>'By sunrise, we were over Sumatra. Because of the clouds, my friend's plane was not visible, so I decided to take the shortest route possible,' he said.<br><br>At Seletar Airport, Capt Mello was told to stay in the plane until the police arrived. But in any case, he couldn't have left the plane on his own since his legs are paralysed and he has had to use a wheelchair since 1977.<br><br>He has already completed one round-the-world flight and this, his second, would put him in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only physically handicapped person to do it, twice over.<br><br>He was interviewed for about 10 hours in all before he was released.<br><br>He said: 'They were very nice to me and I think they have no hard feelings either. I am sorry to mobilise so many people who have so many other things to do.'<br><br>Added Capt Costa: 'In Singapore, there are many sensitive areas and I can understand the high security measures taken in these times of terrorist threats.'<br><br><img src="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2003-08-21/0101.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spencer99:</div><div class="quote_body">I wonder whether the A4s are used because of their better low-speed performance. It must have been hard-pressed for supersonic jets like F16s and F5s to keep pace with a propellor driven a/c.<br><br>It is quite surprising that there are A4s on alert. I always thought that only F5s and F16s are on alert.<br><br>Maybe this is the SOP. If slow unknown a/c and unlikely to be fighters, use A4s.<br><br>A eye-witness who lives in Teck Whye claims that he saw two fighters surrond and escort the plane away. If that is true die liao as that means that our air defence can only intercept the a/c within visual sight of Singapore. I thought they can intercept them from far away.<br><br>But anyway, if it is a real sucide bomber, I am sure the A4 pilots can blow him away with heir 30mm guns.<br><br></div></blockquote>Military aircraft from singapore cannot go into other countries FIR (airspace) with diplomatic clearence. thats why cannot intercept from afar.</div>
