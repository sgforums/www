            <div class='col-md body'>correct me if I am wrong, I though I read a report  in NP that says that the civilian plane was approaching TAB when our fighters intercepted it.<br><br>If it was only spotted on our radar or known to us only when it almost reaches our main AFB, then our surveillance and monitoring assets in place have failed. If it is spotted on our radar and other surveillance assets well before it approaches our airspace without permission/filing flight plan, it should deemed to be hostile. I am not advocating that we should shoot on sight but our interception response is a bit slow ?<br><br></div>

Last time matthias rust flew his tiny plane and landed on the red square in the former soviet union, i believe some very 'atas' soviet general had to step down.<br><br></div>
