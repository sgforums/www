            <div class='col-md body'>Rubber bullets are useful.But then again,there have been instances like in Israel where Palestinian rioters were outright killed by these "less then lethal" ammunition. Perhaps a better substitute would be "beanbag"rounds,CS Grenades and flashbangs.But bare in mind,our troops today have not been trained in riot control unlike US,UK or Aussie troops etc.So how will they react when given such a situation?</div>

Knowing abt of Singapore's laws against rioting and the Internal Security Act along with the infamous  Chapter 55( sorry, but pls correct me if the number is wrong, chances its wrong)<br><br>If u have the intention of inciting a riot or any form of social unrest, chances are the ISA will be used against u.<br><br>And even though our society has gain more autonomous grounds regarding speech and actions, such acts of dissent will surely and swiftly dealt with by our government. Coupled with the culture and social upbringing based on the values and principals that most people were imbued in them when they were young, chances of even flirting with the government's hardlined stance will be almost none.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before we get army involved in IS work, we have the special operations command (the "ang chia" ppl remembered by the older folks). In any case, internal security operations by army is mostly POI, checkpoint manning.<br><br>The SOP reads like the Guardroom SOP, fire rounds into the air after verbal warnings. If push comes to shove, we learnt (so many eons ago) to fire low (not necessarily at the legs, more like into the ground to bounce rounds into crowds' lower limbs (DON't QUOTE ME as this is obviously SUPERCEEDED).<br><br>Those were dangerus times as had a case study when a guard room was 'taken over' by some rioters causing trouble etc. The Guard command and DO panicked and lost control over situation, only the G2IC had prescence of mind to shut camp gates and summon off-duty personnel. Shots were fired (apparently in struggle). Eventually BDO and SnDO were charged for losing control over the situation.</div>
