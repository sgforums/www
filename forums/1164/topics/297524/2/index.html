            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly...I know building nukes...maintaining them is damn expensive...which is why I said it was a crazy idea.<br><br>Although...if you think about stuff in long term...building nukes is more worth it than constantly buying new weapons.<br><br>And to those people who is 100% sure we can win a war...think again. We don't conquer the enemy...we are supposed to make them scared enough to achieve a ceasefire on our terms instead of theirs.<br><br>But the problem is...if the enemy is crazy enough to go on a war with us...what makes you think getting them to surrender is easy? Hell...even the US force in Iraq is having a hard time trying to ensure Iraq 'surrender'( meaning...no suicide bombs or anything)<br><br>Hell...for you to achieve a proper victory...the population of the enemy must be convinced to surrender.<br><br>So what if the enemy got nukes? You guys never hear of a thing called MAD? You do know that during the cold war...both the USSR and US got nukes...but a war never erupt.<br><br>WHY?<br><br>Mutually assured Destruction to both sides...that's why the cold war never erupt into a 'hot war'<br><br>Pakistan and India has nukes as well...did they use nukes on each other? NO.<br><br>Hell...the US is PERFECTLY willingly to let some countries have nukes if it is damn friendly towards the US.<br><br>Irasel got nukes for a LONG time...and the US never say anything about it.<br><br>When North korea tried to developed nukes...everyone including the US is pissed because US never like North Korea from the start.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are assuming your enemy will be a rational one.<br><br>The thing is this, if we get nukes here, what is to stop our potential enemies from getting their own? Pandora's box would already have been opened.<br><br>Another thing to consider, what if your enemy was fanatical enough to be willing to take one or two nukes in exchange for landing one one you?<br><br>Will Singapore be able to take one nuke hit? No.<br><br>Will other countries need more then one nuke to totally take out? Yes.<br><br>When it comes to WMD, it is a lose-lose situtation for Singapore. We will have no bargaining chips, if we do not have a conventional army. Don't have to talk about invasion... a potential enemy does not need to force you to last resort, there are plenty of ways to skin a cat.<br><br>They can simply blockade us and cut off our sea lanes, without a navy to respond and enforce our side of the sea, we are pretty much screwed. They can do plenty of things to us if we do not have a conventional army. They can wage sustained Low-Intensity-Conflict on us and we will be pretty much helpless. As long as they don't cross the line, they can mess with us pretty much all they want because the only thing we have is a nuke and we can't pretty much us it until things are really bad... but they can make it bad enough without ever crossing the line.<br><br>And frankly no nation on the world will look kindly on us if we threaten tonuke anybody for the slightest thing, some things still need to be settled with grunt work and show of conventional force.<br><br>If we dump our conventional forces and just take up nukes, rest assured, you will suddenly realize that Singapore has no bargaining chips in international politics.</div>

You tell me where we hold it in? Istana izzit? You think maintaining it is simple?<br><br>Removing conscription for nukes is a really darn bad idea. So far in your life, how many gungho people have you seen that sign on the Army just for the sake of defending the nation? The moment it's about money and not the passion, we're screwed. We're already an Army with low amount of personnels, removing conscription is bad.<br><br>So let's just say suddenly we have tons of "infantry" and "Freedom Fighter", capable of defending our nuke and maintaining. What are we gonna do? Sit behind and keep firing nukes at their country?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And also, how much you want our GST to be next? 15%? You see other countries test their nukes how many times? Testing it is cheap? We test it at where? Choa Chu Kang? Your backyard?<br><br>The best deterence idea for Singapore is to give NO reasons or BAD reasons to attack Singapore. Countries like Malaysia will suffer GREAT economy lost if they attack us. And what do they gain in return? A little red dot? Plus we got really strong ties with other powerhouses. Attacking us is a really bad idea.<br><br>A nuke can also be viewed as a threat to many other countries, not only just the neighbouring countries. This move can hurt ties between them.<br><br></div>

You tell me where we hold it in? Istana izzit? You think maintaining it is simple?<br><br>Removing conscription for nukes is a really darn bad idea. So far in your life, how many gungho people have you seen that sign on the Army just for the sake of defending the nation? The moment it's about money and not the passion, we're screwed. We're already an Army with low amount of personnels, removing conscription is bad.<br><br>So let's just say suddenly we have tons of "infantry" and "Freedom Fighter", capable of defending our nuke and maintaining. What are we gonna do? Sit behind and keep firing nukes at their country?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And also, how much you want our GST to be next? 15%? You see other countries test their nukes how many times? Testing it is cheap? We test it at where? Choa Chu Kang? Your backyard?<br><br>The best deterence idea for Singapore is to give NO reasons or BAD reasons to attack Singapore. Countries like Malaysia will suffer GREAT economy lost if they attack us. And what do they gain in return? A little red dot? Plus we got really strong ties with other powerhouses. Attacking us is a really bad idea.<br><br>A nuke can also be viewed as a threat to many other countries, not only just the neighbouring countries. This move can hurt ties between them.<br><br></div></blockquote>Please...you are asuming that the enemy will stay sane.<br><br>If everyone is sane...Japan and germany will not declare war on the US in the first place.<br><br>The Arab country will not try and attack Irasel in the first place.<br><br>Napolean will not march his army to Russia.<br><br>Please...in war...people ARE insane. Once the enemy is insane enough to attack us, we will lose the war if they want to drag the war longer.<br><br>I've read an article about Human beings refusing to lose over something minor, even if then end result will be a even worse sistuation.<br><br>A professor put down a 1 dollar coin, and say to his students that they can bid for the 1 dollar with a smaller amount.<br><br>People keep on bidding until they is two person left...they continue to bid for the 1 dollar coin with a much larger amount of money because they want to 'win' .<br><br>Sigh...we are betting that we can win a war if our enemy is sane. Once they are willingly to stop at nothing but to see the destruction of singapore...we are screwed.<br><br>Even if singapore does not worth much to anyone...once the enemy is pissed enough...they will think that the destruction of singapore is jusistified even if they sustain heavy loss.<br><br>They will lose alot...but they can rebuilt. Singapore can't.<br><br>In the long term...we have more to lose as compared to our neighbours.<br><br></div>
