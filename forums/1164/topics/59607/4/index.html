One thing for sure, NSF will never have the rank of 2nd SGT. The reports may be wrong in mentioning the NS status of the soldiers, sometimes in articles, they wrote active NSF as NSman..  (NSman title is for those who already ORD).<br>All are my personal thoughts and true to my knowlegde. </div></blockquote>thats where u are wrong. now they do give NSF 2sg ranks liao.<br>it depends on vocation, and as he was a guardsmen sniper, hence the rank. I had a disruptee in my office a while back. He was an ordinary NSF, but he took a long disruption to study architecture. he had a 2sg rank and was in his late twenties, so i mistook him for a regular, but found out later he was a NSF. apparently, he told me that back b4 he disrupted, it was very common for NSF 3SGs to be promoted to 2SGs due to a lack of manpower, hence his rank.<br>so its not true that NSF WILL NEVER have the rank of 2sg.</div>

THAT should have been done, instead of taking matters into their own hands.<br><br>if we stick to this mentality that "traditionally we have done this so it is ok", then SAF can never reach the level of professionalism they aspire to reach.</div>
