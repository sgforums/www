It is the wrongness of the instructor's actions that is being debated here.<br><br>I will categorically take the stand that the instructor was wrong, and I will say this from the perspective of one who knows the culture very well.  As I said in a previous post, I was trained by a man who was good enough at his job that SOF was inviting him aboard, and based upon what I learned from him, this instructor's act was wrong because it was unnecessary, unprofessional and totally counterproductive.  It is this kind of instructor that contributes to the Commandos' wholly undeserved "all balls no brains" image.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, new to the forum but definitely not new to the topic. I have been reading all the information that I can gather, (at least from the internet, as I am currently not in Singapore) about the death of the serviceman (NSF). Its a sad day for SAF as much as its a sad day for Singapore, for we have lost yet another abled man.<br><br>Like every other abled young man, I served in the SAF as part of my national service to Singapore. To many, they call it a Serve-And-F**koff experience, to me, it was a rite of passage. This experience is unique only to a couple of countries around the world. (eg. Israel, taiwan ...etc) I truly understand that not many of us were that keen to serve in the SAF (be it the Navy, Airforce or the' Dreaded' Army). However, it sure did make some of us a better man.<br><br>Many would agree that the 'NSF' experience is not one to look forward but definitely sweet to look back on. Nobody enjoys the lost of freedom and tough training (for me, that includes keeping awake in air-conditioned lecture theatre - we call it fighting the ZzZ monster)  while in service. All of us can't wait for the day when we get to collect our pink IC from the manpower clerk and wave goodbye to regimented life for good (until reservist comes along that is).<br><br>It always seems more personal when you are part of the experience or event, therefore, for those in the forum that are still in national service, its natural  to feel more aggrieve as you are still subjected to the illegal practices during your training. (It would be presumptuous of me to suggest that no one has been subjected to illegal training before, everyone did, face it.. its just the magnitude of illegality) For some of the old timers out there, the SAF has really changed alot. Not many can remember Pasir Laba camp anymore and not many can recall charging up Peng Kang Hill. We must understand that the SAF is always learning and changing to suit times. However, that doesn't make those that are going through national service now any lesser than those before them.<br><br>2Sg Hu's death should be look upon as a landmark rather than another piece of statistic in the history of SAF. The 'tekan-culture' would definitely pipedown for a while, but it will never ever be totally eradicated. Soldiers today serving national service are unlike those in the past. They are mostly highly educated and have high ideals in life (not that those in the past didn't, but being educated and idealistic during my father's time just seems to be a rarity, having enough to eat and a roof for shelter is top priority).<br><br>Then we got to ask ourselves. Would our national service experience be any different, if we didn't have to carry our duffle bag and ran around the parade square, or get turned-out in the middle of our sleep to perform ridiculous exercise till dawn or stand in the parade square for hours without water break? It is these experiences that made my memories of national service so much sweeter.<br><br>However, what good is it to have to go through all that and not live to remember it. Where do we draw the line between realistic training and tekanning-session? The TSR? Screw the TSR, its like what has been said earlier, something to cover the backside of the top-brass, so that someone down the line can be held accountable. So that some small little fry can take the blame for what has happened. Today the small fry was Noel Cheah.<br><br>Some of us may have been instructors before and found that to operate fully within the TSR is ridiculous. How many of us had been deprived of sleep before an exercise the next day? 7 hours of undisturbed rest is a myth. There are compromises made everyday with regards to training standards. Some are too lenient, some are too overboard. Where do we go from this scenario, go easy on the guys in service? That has only a temporary comforting effect, but in the long run, SIngapore stand to lose. The people responsible should be made accountable and pay the price for their actions. The removal of the CCO seems harsh but that is what the chain of command is for. But then going by that argument, Rear Adm.Teo should have resigned too. What do you think? haha.. In any case, whichever side of the fence we sit on, lets hope that 2Sg Hu's death has not been in vain, let it be a lesson learnt for SAF and a stern reminder to those in service. And to all those out there that felt that they have been ill-treated in training, there is always the SAF Counseling Helpline. (Doing an endless set of 20 pushup does not count as ill-treatment, we've all been through that, come on, you've got to come up with something better!!!) Cheers!!!</div>
