Full stop for this,end of story.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For those who died serving the SAF during peace time, it is a loss to SG as there are lesser and lesser males to do NS. Also my sympathies to the family of the late for the pain and anguish they are going thru. <span style="color: darkblue;">Life and death is already predestined. When the time for a person is up, no matter what he/she is doing, they will leave this world. There are news reported that a healthy person could die when sleeping etc... Get what I am trying to say? </span></span><br><br>I wasn't refering to anybody at all.

This coming from a guy who said:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Life and death is already predestined. When the time for a person is up, no matter what he/she is doing, they will leave this world.</strong></blockquote>Lotus, in your attempt to wriggle out of a tight spot, you have very clearly demonstrated your hypocrisy.  Instead of dealing with the issues raised by your post, you have tried to worm your way out with some tired old cliches to make yourself look warm and fuzzy, and only ended up contradicting yourself.<br><br>I am still waiting for you to attempt to defend your position.  I would ask you to put your money where your mouth is, but it looks like your foot's taking up too much room.</div>
