He was with the Naval Diving Unit, that time he was in charge of taking care of NSF direct entry BMT. He told us that during every PT, there would be one ambulance waiting at the field and at least one would end up at sick bay after PT. Not that they PT was very tough but the PTI beat up those guys. The officers never took action and allowed it to happend and one day he could not take it anymore and fought with a PTI during PT, the navy posted him to the airforce. He told us how the recruits only had 10 mins to eat their meals and once sit down to eat they had to finish and fall in in 10 mins. He was very sad looking at that.  Those recurits were like in hell and he commented how we airforce guys were in heaven. During his guards training, his friend died during the 10km run test and he was just meters from the finish line when he collapse. That guy died on the puma and the army never gave recog him as a guardsmen posthumously when he had completed almost every test and just shy of the 10km finish line. I guess that 3SG ORD bitter about the SAF.  </div></blockquote>Only 4 batch was train by guards <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 1990 batch and 1991 batch <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>isit ur friend sgt Kang?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
