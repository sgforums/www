            <div class='col-md body'>Geez, ST, that's a bit rough, lumping sorrowz together with Walter Mitty here.  Not that I'm defending sorrowz's stance, of course - there are just some mitigating circumstances to be considered here.<br><br>Despite our differences in views, I will accord sorrowz with the credence that his role as an active Commando demands.  Unlike 35, he is not talking out of his arse.<br><br>To some extent, the emotional part of me even agrees with sorrowz.  If I were currently in that environment, I would be inclined to close ranks as well.<br><br>The perspective I take is different because it has been tempered over time, by the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and the integration of my experiences in Commandos with my other professional activities in the ten years since.<br><br>I have complete confidence that in the same period, my contemporaries who stayed on have developed similarly, and will be perfectly capable of doing what Commandos do best - excelling in, rather than just surviving, the most adverse conditions.  It will take a lot of soul-searching and the acknowledgement of some very unpleasant truths, but the fellows I know have the nerve and the strength to take a good, long, hard look at themselves and tell themselves what they really see.</div>

It is patently obvious that they are in for a big shake up and the time is now.<br><br>Do I still retain my belief that they are an elite unit? Yes. Do I think they can still protect us? Of course. Do I think they are in general an effective fighting unit? Certainly.<br><br>Do I however, think that some cdos. have betrayed the trust and ethos invested to them by the unit and have gone out to abuse that very trust invested in them by the wearing of the red beret?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>And that's what the bottom line is now. Some people have betrayed that very trust. The only way for this unit to be effective is if it responds to its own flaws not by covering them up or going on an mission of damage control, but by dealing with it ruthlessly as they would with the enemy. After all they are no country club.<br><br>Going down with your men, for honour and glory may be good in battle, but I'm afriad for such a crime like killing a trainee, there is no glory to be found there other than that which had been self-manufactured to butter over the true paethetic nature of the while event. Your chief goes in shame, not glory for serving the nation. If anything, a disservice has been done. Call a cat a cat and a dog a dog. Ultimately your loyality is still to the nation and not your chief. That's something prehaps big unit peronnel get better then elite outfits. We serve the nation and not the other way round. If my CO. is proven to be inadequate or wrong, sympatise as I might, ultimately I will have to take the right side and do what is correct, rather then go down in blind loyality.<br><br>Again your mentioning of the JI threat displays prehaps your lack of understanding of the true nature of the beast here. Would they be psyed up by our denouncements here? It would be good to note that the Cdos have been doing a far better job of psying up terrorists recently with their recent blunders.<br><br>Anyway, it's almost certain that the JI people still have quite a bit of sense in them and are more likely to view the whole thing objectively to acess the real nature of the issue before making their move, something unfortunately some red berets are unable to do.<br><br>It would behoove the Cdos. to take a hard look in the mirror and stop defending themselves but rather see how they should rebuld themselves instead of constantly point fingers at the anger of the general public now rightfully directed at them.<br><br>After all, you are all supposed to be an elite outfit ready for anything. So live up to that and stop whining that the G.P is bashing your rightfully for your blunders. If anything, such childish behaviour of mindless blind defending, finger pointing and going down with my men along with the inability to deal with their own mistakers would be the thing giving the JI people the most incentive to view you all as a unit which is growing soft and unprofessional.<br><br>Why are the comments here so harsh? Because if you claim to be the best and fail to live up to them, you better be prepared for some storm headed your way. If some cdos here can't take the heat and demands of their profession and ethos, prehaps they should consider 35MM's Gunner's job.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Blockhead:</div><div class="quote_body">Interesting points Tango. But i am concerned about a few things.:<br><br>1) That having 'volunteers' may attract the wrong kind of people. (i.e. too much testosterone, not enough brains)<br><br>2) Even if unsuitable volunteers are washed out, the numbers that come thru may not be enough. (Probably the most impt reason i can think of)<br><br>3) If it was voluntary, parents may not allow their son(s) to volunteer, compounding (2)<br><br>4) Even if they had volunteers, it still wouldn't make a difference to if training may be any less dangerous if TSRs are ignored, which u pointed out, albeit indirectly. As such, the problem is not with who is doing it, or rather what is being done.<br><br>5) Any incident that results in a death is still a death, and doesn't bear any less weight, even if they are volunteers since they are still NSF.<br><br>6) Lastly, it would inadvertantly have an adverse effect within SAF itself, since a volunteer unit may result in a heightened awareness of "us and them" among units, and may prove to be too divisive. (Yes, maybe i am streching this a bit, but i hope u get what i mean.)<br><br>All that said tho, I think there is some credit to Tango's argument, and frankly speaking, i think SAF would rather have adopted such a volutary scheme if it was possible. Unfortunately, i think practical considerations makes it impossible. Just my opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Anytime bro...opinions are good; we all should learn from ppl who correctly point out our flaws.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Regarding your first point, about too much testosterone and too little brain...I guess i didn't make this clear enuff, but in previous posts, I suggested that it is not just simply volunteering to get yourself through. It should include recommendations/references from your BMT OC and Plt Cmdr based on initiative and performance. I realize that most of these BMT trainees might wanna go SISPEC or OCS, but there are others that are just as capable, only that it doesn't show till later. Take for example a unit needs to replenish its ranks with these types of troops...which is later reflected in the postings we receive...wat I'm saying we change is that it should not be a fixed/rigid system of posting...change along the lines like..."a unit needs to fill xxx number of specialized places and we are looking for volunteers. People who wash out will be rotated back to their original postings." No shame, no questions asked...<br><br>Second point. that unfortunately, we cannot really resolve...the Navy SEALs has a high drop-out rate, and the SAS even higher. The numbers of trainees do not have to be substantially higher, but just a little more to compensate for losses due to injury or DOR (Drop On Request). But there is a big difference between volunteering and being posted...even if an individual washed out from the course, he can at least say that he tried and had a taste of wat it was like...<br><br>Third point, aahhh....isn't it the point in time when we ask ourselves whether are we still boys or men? lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Eventually, who makes the decision for us? Ourselves or someone else? Remember, there's no consent form to sign here...lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> jk...<br><br>Fourth point, correctly so. And I may not have made it clear, but like you said and I totally agree, like many others here do, that realistic training has to have certain safety parameters...although I've gone through it before, head-dunking should be banned...replace it with icy cold trickle showers....that should keep the trainee awake and yet not breach TSR....<br><br>Fifth point, true...a death is still a death...many of us know from training, that accidents/incidents do not respect rank, age or status as NSF or Regular. However, I'm not suggesting that by being an all-volunteer outfit, we ask for a free trip to Hell and back...what I'm simply stating is that the individual who volunteered for this knows what to expect of himself and what kind of training is involved. On the other hand of cos', I refer back to the 4th point in that there is a difference between being too realistic and training safety....<br><br>SIxth point...There is already an existing "us" and "them"...you don't see support companies or recce companies mixing with line companies do you? Except for exercises of cos'...again with the exception of BRC and battalion scouts...Most of us might know that those from BRC, Snipers, etc, seldom wear the unit tee-shirt, instead wearing our own tee-shirts procliaming the status of our vocations. Second, some units allow their scouts to wear floppy hats around the camp (except on guard duty) like a badge of honour. Third, and this only applies to those that have carried it...the carbine/sniper rifle is like a distinction of elitism within units...I always liked to tease line troops about how compact it is to have a carbine as compared to their M-16s...of cos'...its the SAR-21 now. Last, scouts in particular (dunno about snipers, but maybe you guys can fill me in on that) are always used in unit-level training exercises to simulate enemy cdo attacks...why? For reasons being that they are seen as the "elite" of units...<br><br>My point? There is already a heightened sense of "us" and "them"...elitism is more than just putting on a fancy tee-shirt or wearing flop hats...it is earned through the hard way, therefore it comes as a part of the 'territory' of being in a specialized outfit...irregardless of volunteerism or otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Good points you've got though...its just that I think such changes are possible to achieve, albeit some modifications have to be made... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some recommended readings that may explain how such kind of training can go out of control.... Stanford Prison Experiment.<a href="http://www.prisonexp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.prisonexp.org/</a>.<br><br>In this instance, Teo Chee Hean was right to put the responsibility squarely on the instructors for being unprofessional.<br><br>Why was CCO to be blamed too ? You can't only depend on the instructors professionalism, this form of training is extremely dangerous and can go out of hand easily even if the instructors happen to have 'buddha-like" personalities in real life. Checks and supervisions are very important. Being the CCO, he is responsible to ensure that such supervisions were effective.<br><br>Just my opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I am familiar with the Stanford study and the thought had occurred to me early on.  However, it fails to apply when you consider that the instructors a) do it as a profession and b) are dealing with trainees, not prisoners.<br><br>Given that the shortest chain of command involved here goes instructor - course commander - CO SOCT - CCO, the supervision provided by the CCO would be based would be affected by three degrees of separation.  While it is entirely possible that the CCO was negligent, it is also possible that that the CCO's directives could have been altered as they went down the line, like a game of Chinese Whispers.  The prudent course of action would be to determine which of these scenarios has taken place in the course of the investigation and pinpoint the source of the problem, rather than wiping out the whole chain of command in one fell swoop.  If this principle is applied, th Chief of Army and Chief of Defence Forces may as well be removed too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, trainees are not prisoners but the study was conducted using students....students as guards and students as prisoners.<br><br>the experiment was disrupted  after a few days coz Zimbardo was surprise how quickly people change their stripes.<br><br>I quote...""These guys were all peaceniks," he recalled of the students chosen to be guards. "They became like Nazis.<br><br>"It shows how easy it is for good people to become perpetrators of evil."<br><br>So if the instructors were not professional and were allowed to conduct their training "unrestrained", the studies indicates that it could easily go out of control.<br><br>1 dead, 6 injured was the result in this instance.<br><br>About the CCO being responsible, i stand corrected coz i did not know that there were several layers separating him from the instructors.<br><br>Perhaps for the inquiry to investigate thoroughly and make proper recommendations , having a new management team in charge would be better coz the old team could be the obstacle to change ie. "traditionally we have always done it this way, no problem etc"<br>A mindset change, requires new blood ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stanford fails to be mitigation because the instructors were under a different set of directions from the student guards.  If anything, they should have been all too aware of what could happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone here believe that the tough realistic training for our boys is impt to turn them from a young boy to a tough soldier.<br><br>Tekan sessions are to break them , toughen them up &amp; to endure the pain &amp; sufferings so that they could perform &amp; fight in a real war which could have a soldier fighting for non stop 48 maybe even 72hrs b4 being relieved.<br><br>Therefore tough realistic training is a must but with all safety precaution is taken to a certain degree wihout losing it realism. Therefore training accident will happen becos military training itself is inherently  dangerous.<br><br>The problem are our boys fit enough to endure it? (with respect to the two cases where soldiers died after a run especially the obese recruit)<br><br>Why I ask this is becos the SAF has been upgrading the fitness status of our boys from PES C to B &amp; even with older NS men since the decreasing male cohort in the SAF. Will this make the SAF having softer training so to compensate for weaker soldier or will it increase the training accidental rate? Maybe both.<br><br>One example that I have encountered :I remember one big guy with a slight degree of high blood pressure who is PES C but is certified to undergo combat training( nowsaday PES C has many levels, some is certified to undergo combat training) was attached to our coy as a PC runner.<br><br>On the first day of our ICT, my unit did a relaxed tactical march (maybe 5km)thru the forest so to let us get use to our uniform again.<br><br>Less than half a hour into walk &amp; take cover etc, this big guy pengsan &amp; has to be send to the medical centre &amp; we never see him again most probably got downgraded.<br><br></div>
