            <div class='col-md body'>Hello every1, jus my 2 cents,<br><br>It is tragic that a death has occured during the conduction of this so called "unauthorised training", but what I feel that it is more than meets the eye.  I myself have gone through the supposely water treatment during SERE (getting my head dunked into water) and I am sure most of the older generation might have gone through even worse type of treatment during SERE which may last longer especially those who go through the Ranger course.<br><br>I don't know about how the training guidelines are like but I am sure that all those tekkaning session which we all know existed doesn't exist in the training guideline. What Mindef can approve of is certainly what that is seem humane. Thats why training guidelines will never have things like water treatment, not allowing to go toilet, high kneeling, deprivation of sleep or food in SERE. But those who have gone through it knows that it exist as it simulates NEARLY the conditions which will be given to a POW. But com'on, saying things like putting a bullet through the trainee head is exaggerating cause it is like saying there should be beating up of trainees, whipping them..cause I am sure not much mercy will be shown if u will to get caught. I am sure these kind of things wouldnt happen in peacetime training as it will DEFINITELY injure the soldier. (There has being no reported cases of people drowning from Water Treatment and I am quite sure it was implemented at the very beginning when SERE was introduced)<br><br>I am not siding with the people who caused the death of the CST trainee. My point is, to the best of knowledge, I know that water treatment is definitely part of the UNOFFICIAL package in SERE although it might not be in training guidelines so that, as to put it bluntly, MINDEF can cover their backside whenever there is a need.<br><br>However it is rather disturbing when we have 1 death and 6 other people who need to be rushed to the hospital. There has never happened before. So my conclusion is the instructors who are conducting it MIGHT have overdo it, maybe to the extent of forcing the heads into the water for over a minute or more. Other than that I am sure things like fringing the training guidelines in CST is just BULLSHIT cause I am sure most people who have gone through SERE or CST have gone through it.<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>unfortunately, commandos are slightly different from other units... their seeming lack of discipline, over-breaming self confidence and off-worldly pride,  is truely, out of this world....[/b][/quote]<br><br>Erm, I think it is quite out of point for you to say this in this topic. Anyway, the statement "out of this world" seems abit too harsh. You should see how the elite units of US n UK behave...namely SEALs, SAS.. how ill-disciplined and how much they disregard the authority. But surprisingly, it is these people who get the jobs done.<br><br>I am not saying that the SAF commandos can get jobs done as they have not really seen real action yet except for some of the older generation there. But being humans, there are certainly some who will tend to have what you call over-breaming self confidence and the off-worldly pride, because of what they have gone through and the fact that they survive it gave them cause them to have such attitude. I am not saying it is right for them to portray such behaviour but somehow people, (I am not saying all) with such character are really good in their own ways and this cause them to be proud of their unit and themselves.<br><br>It is just really the traditions and the tough training of the unit that cause the commandos to portray the behaviour which you have described. Maybe you have bad experiences with some commandos, but do give them credit for what they have gone through and the "never say die or quit or lose" attitude which they possess.<br><br></div>

But I would like to say that submerging a person' head under the water for 4 times won't kill that person unless it is for a long period of time. Trust me I know it. I don't think that the water treatment part is a punishment. It is more like part of the standard training package which is not stated in the training programme.<br>However the fact that he drown and 6 others have to be sent to the hospital means that the trainers have overdone it. So they are still asses. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by tripwire:<br>[b]i think i need to clarify... it seems that my last post might be a bit misleading....<br><br>1... i dont think admiral teo... is also one of those bastard CO whose only thing in their head is promotion...<br><br>2... neither do i think admiral teo approves of non-compliance with standing general orders...<br><br>3... i dont think he is negligent... nor the COA or CDF as well...<br><br>I wish to debate on this issue. Firstly I am sure the COA, CDF, and your admiral Teo knows about such thing as water treatment in SERE or CST under the POW treatment. Com'on they have being in the SAF for such a long time. Even if they did not experience it before, they will have some friends in the commandos who tell them about it. Like what I have said, water treatment is all along, at least up till my times as an NSF, an unofficial training in SERE or CST package. Now they are denying the fact that it is part of the training and is unauthorised shows how they are trying to cover their asses.  True, it is not in the training guidelines but like what I have stressed, training guidelines are meant to look good and humane. If not when anything happens, it is the top brass in MINDEF who is going to suffer.  And now they are replacing the Chief and the CO of School of Commandos cause of this incident so that they can at least tell Singapore of what they have done.<br><br>Sadly it is the case almost everywhere in the world, top brass knows what is going on but when something happens, they use the guidelines to put the blame on someone so that at least people will still have confidence in them and the organisation. It is just politics...<br>Well my point is if you want to replace the CCO and the CO cause of the negligent conduct of the instructors, you replace the top brass in MINDEF too.<br><br>Punishment should therefore be meted only to the instructors for only the reason they overdo it and not to the fact that they implement such treatment. Cause I don't really think that the people at the top do not know that water treatment is usually implemented in CST and SERE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway no matter what anyone says, no matter what stinking attitudes some ppl have still trying to justify the need to cause his death, MINDEF have officially stated that it is unacceptable to have such unauthorised training. The blame lies squarely on themselves, and they have already accepted full resposibility for it. So no matter what u guys say, theres going to be changes. if u want to contest the policies of MINDEF, do so at your own risk. Just hope that u don't end up doing similar brainless shit like those commandos did. Or you'll pay the price too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that even if a SERE course should have water torture, these instructors screwed up. If so many trainees needed to be hospitalized, they overdid it. There is no question about that. Even those who have been through the SERE course have never seen so many people hospitalized. The five instructors were negligent. They deserve to be busted. The CO is ultimately responsible for them, so he deserves it too. The CCO probably got kicked because this is the second strike after the BCU fiasco. He is clearly inculcating a culture among the commandoes that is detrimental to the defense of Singapore -- all show, no substance.<br><br>Whether the SERE course should have water torture or not is not for the instructors on the ground to decide. It is not even for the CO to decide on his own. It needs to be decided by MINDEF, and the decision is enshrined in the TSRs. The decision is no immersion of the head, only hosing down. By not following these orders, the instructors are guilty of insubordination and their CO has been lax in maintaining discipline.<br><br>This also reveals a cultural problem in the SAF where just because previous instructors have done it before in previous batches, it suddenly becomes OK. It is not OK, no matter how many people do it or how long it has been a "tradition". It is still a breach of military discipline. If the instructors really felt that realistic SERE training needed immersion of the head, they should have brought it up through the existing chain of command. The CO could have suggested it to MINDEF and if approved after consultation with the SAF Medical Corps it would be put into the TSR. That is the way things are done in a professional and disciplined army. The instructors cannot just decide to do it on their own, turn it into their own "tradition" and "the only crime is being caught". That is not "tough, realistic training". That is simply NO DISCIPLINE! COs and instructors must not overstep their authority.<br><br>I am glad that the new minister is finally putting his foot down and cleaning this up. The SAF is turning into a bunch of private fiefdoms, where every unit just does whatever the hell it wants to do and tries not to be caught breaking general orders. That happened with the BCU competition. It is also common for other units to cheat, just that they weren't caught. Discipline needs to be reestablished throughout the SAF. When MINDEF says something must stop, it has to stop, not just "don't get caught" and "cover your ass". Those orders are given for a reason.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some trainees in the CST course don even know they WILL NOT FAIL the course even if they give in to the water treatment and give out the information. Sure the instructors didnt bothered to brief the trainees about the water treatment and POW treatment.<br><br>For the fear of failing the course and having to recourse, most endured thru the treatment, going into the water again and again not giving up. And why the trainees don struggle out of water when they cant take it anymore? Cos their hands are tied from behind and more than one instructor is holding them in the water...<br><br>i'm sure the instructors could have given briefing before the course and the trainees should be clear of the course, not lanlan have to go thru the treatment.<br><br>Jus too bad that the CCO is removed from his duties. The trust in his instructors to do the job properly had been a regret. He cant be everywhere to supervise the trainings, his trust had been misplaced.  Let the sinned be dealt with...<br></div>

The upshot of this is that you will inevitably get you mixed bag of angels and arseholes.  Unfortunately, there is no preemptive way of weeding out the arseholes - a problem has to be severe enough before significant action can be taken.<br><br>A case in point would be two of the platoon sergeants in my company - I will call them N and S for convenience.  S was my platoon sergeant, and I swear you will never find a more professional soldier in any army.  His level of preparation as a trainer was as close to perfect as anything I have ever seen.  He knew the minute details of the subject matter, and he made sure we understood not only what we were supposed to do and how we were supposed to do it, but why as well.  The result was a platoon that still ran like a Swiss watch when plans went right out the window, as they are wont to do after the first shot is fired.  Not that things were entirely problem-free, of course.  As tripwire had pointed out, we do lack some discipline, but in administrative matters.  On the rare occasion that something screwed up, S never raised his voice.  He would simply come into the barracks, shake his head in disappointment and ask what we thought we were doing.  The whole platoon would trip over themselves backwards to set things straight.<br><br>N, on the other hand, was the ultimate psychotic boy scout.  He would be running around, yapping like a Jack Russel on amphetamines, terrorising his platoon.  Nutcase that he was, I would not be at all surprised if he was the instructor who drowned the trainee - it sounds perfectly like him.<br><br>The funny thing about it was that N was ex-SOF, while S always stayed in the battalion.  My OC at the time was from SOF and was performing his OC tour with my company.  When the CSM was sent off for his Warrant Officer's course, the OC had to pick a stand-in CSM for an overseas exercise.  Despite being non-SOF and being outranked by N, S was selected to be the CSM, and as always, did a sterling job of it - he was selected as the best CSM amongst the companies that went for that exercise.<br><br>The impression I got was that the OC, being a man of good judgement, would have entirely preferred not to have N in the company.  Wherever possible, the important jobs went to S instead despite his being of lower rank, because he was more competent.  However, N was a lifer, and there was not much that could be done about that.<br><br>On top of that, we once ended up in the same training area as some of the SOF guys.  N hung around with them, trying to look like one of the boys, but they pretty much ignored him.  However, they did repeatedly approach S and ask him when he was going to join SOF, and S had to keep saying that he was happy in the battalion.  The SOF boys preferred not to have N about as well, but unfortunately, unlike units like the SAS, the selection process does not allow for rejection on the grounds that the candidate will not fit in with the unitÂ’s ethos.<br><br>The unfortunate bottom line is that I am not surprised at all that something like this incident happened - with arseholes like N running about, it was bound to happen at some point.  Even more unfortunate is the fact that nothing much could have been done about it until it was too late.<br></div>
