            <div class='col-md body'>the way i see it, i think the 3 of u (gedakan,nathanG5, 35mm) (sorry abt spelling) are all assuming the other party is going the extreme.<br><br>maybe consider it this way, the CST course is a necessary 'evil' if u want the cdos to survive under trying conditions.  however, it shouldn't be done to such an extreme that it goes beyond clearly stated restrictions to the extent of jeopardising the lives of the trainees.  but i do agree with those above who stated that maybe 7 casualties indicates that something should not have been done during that particular course.<br><br>however, i may also be wrong: perhaps previous similar courses have similar casualty rates, just that there are no deaths, so the public wasn't informed.<br><br>anyway, if the regulations are such that they only cover the asses of the higher-ups, then perhaps the death of one trainee is that only way o ensure that regulations are in line with what takes place DURING the actual course itself.  otherwise, why are those lines of words called 'regulations' in the first place?<br><br>just my POV, note that i'm 15, never been to NS (yet), so i may be wrong on everything. . . just voicing an opinion, thats all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woah... so much has been said  8 ... here's my 2 cents worth.  as a former sniper from 7SIB (3 batches before 2 SG Hu), who went thru CST too, i would say that for us snipers, CST is not a "necessary 'evil' " as mentioned by laser51088 earlier. mebbe for cdos, it is, but i say "mebbe" only becos i'm not from cdos. for us snipers, we r issued wif auto-injectors to prevent capture and  becoming POWs. btw, the cse was an experience and IF u survive, it does make u feel like a stronger person.<br><br>laser51088 is rite, any cse "shouldn't be done to such an extreme that it goes beyond clearly stated restrictions to the extent of jeopardising the lives of the trainees" and the reason why we r all here is that "7 casualties indicates that something should not have been done during that particular course". so, let's just face the truth, even TCH has publicly admitted that the 'special treatment' was unauthorised.<br><br>i find it hard to justify if any life is worth it (i.e. KIT) at all, but at the very least, can we agree that 2SG Hu should be the last to be KIT? and after all that is said and done, can we remember what TCH  said? Anyone who is responsible for soldiers should train them well, but also look after them well. let's not blind ourselves with arguing either sides. very imptly, how do we ensure that our guys get the best possible trg while ensuring that they return to civilian life safely after they have served the nation?<br><br>let's not forget Hu's ultimate sacrifice by merely arguing and pointing fingers.  we have to live on from this tragic episode and honor Hu by ensuring that while SAF remains a "decisive force", it does not compromise the safety of our citizens.  When I have a son in future, i wnat him to serve NS too, but like Hu's parent's, i want him to return home safely after serving his country....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been lurking around this thread for awhile reading the responses and all...seems to me that some of us don't know why there's a misconception regarding CST and the applicability of it.<br><br>The big reason why its conducted for specialized troops is because of the nature of their profession. Snipers are always in for a hard time when they are captured...history has proven that the enemy isn't very kind to snipers. You might have an auto-injector, but at that moment you might hesitate...no offence espanol_man...I was also from 7 SIB myself... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So goes the same for BRC-types and cdos. Why? They are regarded as the enemy that is small in concentration, but cause the most havoc. As a result, it requires that these types of soldiers need some form of realistic training to give them a taste of what they might experience 10-fold in a real situation. I'm not saying that it should breach training safety parameters. I went through CST myself...the treatment given to Infantry, Armour, and Guards is actually quite different. I believed for reasons of historical rivalry, Gdsmen actually get it a little worse than others...lol....those who have gone through CST might remember Staff Bala... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I made it through the course...hated being tied up, blindfolded and subjected to water torture, crawling in mud, being shoved around, staying dirty for days on end. But I came out of it realizing my endurance limits better, and knowing what to expect if my team was ever compromised. It made my team work harder during training exercises to prevent such an eventuality.<br><br>The CST was only one part of it. I even suggested back then that us specialized types should even go through a kind of 'hell week' and even the Airborne course. I'm not gung-ho or anything, but my logic is that since we are already trained to such an extent, we might as well go all the way...<br><br>Maybe the problem is that we don't properly screen the types of soldiers that are going into these vocations. I suggested in the other thread that maybe it might be better that they have a system of voluntary service...and the applicant should have an outstanding fitness, marksmanship (esp for snipers), high motivation, no psychological problems, no major health problems if any...the reward? a better vocation pay. I know it sounds highly theoretical, but I believe it might work better, irregardless of education level determining the years of service; much like the cdos...all serve for 2 1/2 yrs...<br><br>CST training has to be kept realistic. BUT it has to remain within certain safety parameters. The balance between realism and safety however, has to be redetermined from time to time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

I am not assuming that anyone has gone to the extreme.  The fact that we have a dead trainee shows that things have already gone to the extreme - there is no assumption here.  Anybody defending the instructor's perspective is by extension defending taking things to that extreme.<br><br>It seems that those who take a different view to Nathan or myself seem to be getting at the principle of "whatever does not kill you will make you stronger".  Well and good, except that it operates upon the assumption that it does not kill you.  In this case, the assumption has obviously been violated.<br><br>For those who argue for realism in training, the question is, what is the point at which increasing realism produces diminishing returns?<br><br>For argument's sake, let us go down the alternative line of argument.  In the event of a real war, the enemy will try drowning POWs to get information out of them, so we train our troops to withstand that.  Well and good.  But wait, they might also try driving hot skewers into people to get information.  Fine - we'll turn our trainees into kebabs.  Hmm - they might also try skinning prisoners like the Lebanese do.  Okay, let's string the boys up and peel them like oranges.<br><br>See where this is going?<br><br>Well and good that we prepare our troops for the realities of the situation.  At the end of the day, the objective is to try to ensure that they don't sing like canaries when they are captured.  Within limits, there is a point to CST training inasmuch as we have to get the troops prepared for the event that an enemy will not be civilised and respect the Geneva Convention.  There is no utility in taking it to the point where one trainee is drowned and five others are hospitalised.  That is just a waste of manpower, and it makes 2Sgt Hu's death pointless.<br><br>One point I take particular exception to is 35MM Gunner's question, "did it occur 2 u tat they (instructors) r actually prolonging their lives (trainees)????? ".  I would have thought that the answer is fairly obvious - 2Sgt Hu was KILLED in the training.  One would have to be blind, deaf or particularly stupid to not see that this is a case of SHORTENING lives, not prolonging them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>35MM Gunner's position is certainly badly flawed, he attempts to appeal to emotionalism and shaky reasoning rather then viewing the entire thing from a objective point of view.<br><br>Though I have sympathy for those instructors whoes lives are not circling the drain, this is no way marrs my objective view that there is simply no way to condone what they did. There is no justification possible, no excuses of realistic training or over hardcoreness to justify an training session that took one live and nearly six others as well. If this is what 35MM Gunner wants to justify as an acceptable attrition ration for typical training, I shudder to envision what other things are possible when we apply his reasoning to other areas of the SAF.<br><br>Maybe we should shake up our troops with life arty rounds? To make sure they know how stressful it is like to dig foxholes under bombardment?<br><br>Why not go the full mile and use shock treatment, finger crushing and the like in POW training?<br><br>In the end, training is to prepare somebody for the actual event, not actually BE the actual event itself, which in itself will be the litmus test for what the trooper is made of. Training or whatever ranger commando nonsense course is not, and was never meant to be, as 35MM put it, the walk or the talk.<br><br>Training may be tough, but it must always be conducted with the safety of the trainee at the uppermost of the agenda, and checks and measures must be in place to make sure things do not go overboard. Trainee volunteer SEALs typically drop out of the course, they do not leave in bodybags. Much less for our conscripted personnel who want little part in all this but to get through without a scratch.<br><br>Showing these instructors and the ilk any mercy is to send out a message to any aspiring "combat simulators" that they can get away with implementing their own idea of training simulations. Let this be a lesson to them and all. The basic operating premise of the military is to STICK TO PROCEDURE because they are there for a reason. How would you like ICBM silo officers to get a little creative in following their own procedure? SSBN Captains?<br><br>Tough training does not have to equal dangerous training, and it would be good for 35MM Gunner to seperate the two. This death was not just tragic, it was sensless. And 35MM Gunner's impassioned defence of the instructors is an insult and a belitting of the true grostuque nature of the deed.</div>
