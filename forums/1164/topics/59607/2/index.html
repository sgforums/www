The harder and more realistically we train them, the more likely they are to fight well and survive when called upon to defend the nation. The training also has to be conducted professionally and safely. MINDEF therefore constantly aims to strike the right balance between training realism and safety. We take all the safety precautions and measures feasible to minimise risks. But in the nature of military training, there will always remain some risks which cannot be completely eliminated.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>My Mister. IT WAS UNAUTHORISED<br>so, how long have i been saying he was drowned? See? I knew the whole thing long ago. Justice has been done. Thank God. Anyway u yourself said the training has to be "conducted professionally and safely". In my friend's instance, his death was because those people who think too highly of themselves have become unprofessional and paid no heed to safety. And you, my friend, in still trying to justify their actions where even MINDEF has indicted them of this crime, is coming dangerously near to being one of them. If those fools didn't want this to happen, they might do well to use their brains to think of the possible consequences of their actions, especially of having unsanctioned training practices. No use doing something brainless and then lamenting the past. In this case, it was a case of brawns over brains, which I fear, may just be a tad too common in the SAF.<br>No doubt that the willingness of MINDEF to reveal the whole circumstances of my friend's death shows a encouraging trend towards openness and honesty which an armed force with "ethics" as part of the 7 core values would well do with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I once heard from a Guards 3SG during my NS that before he got posted to airforce as an RP section leader.  He was with the Naval Diving Unit, that time he was in charge of taking care of NSF direct entry BMT. He told us that during every PT, there would be one ambulance waiting at the field and at least one would end up at sick bay after PT. Not that they PT was very tough but the PTI beat up those guys. The officers never took action and allowed it to happend and one day he could not take it anymore and fought with a PTI during PT, the navy posted him to the airforce. He told us how the recruits only had 10 mins to eat their meals and once sit down to eat they had to finish and fall in in 10 mins. He was very sad looking at that.  Those recurits were like in hell and he commented how we airforce guys were in heaven. During his guards training, his friend died during the 10km run test and he was just meters from the finish line when he collapse. That guy died on the puma and the army never gave recog him as a guardsmen posthumously when he had completed almost every test and just shy of the 10km finish line. I guess that 3SG ORD bitter about the SAF.</div>

And in this case, clearly it is not training. So please get it into your brain that no one here is against tough training.

            <div class='col-md body'>35mm Gunner, I'm afraid your logic is flawed to me. I'm all for realistic training, I do believe in te maxim that the more we sweat in peace, the less we bleed in war, but in this case, someone has to be hung. There is a reason why the TSR is there, that is to make sure that training, while realistic, stays within bounds of reasonabl safety and minimisin accidents/casualties.<br><br>I know that no matter what, accidents do occur, and people do die in training, no matter what we do. I'm not proposing we go out and hang someone whenever something goes wrong, sometimes (as in the case of the REC), theres just no-one to hang.<br><br>But look at this drowning case, its not as if all the TSR and safety rules were adhered to, and still someone died. Rules and regulations were in place, the instructors involved knew about it, and still wilfully disobeyed them and subject their trainees to unacceptable traineed. And it was not an isolated case, 1 died and 6 ended up in hospital with similar injuries...<br><br>As for the removal of the Chief Cdo Officer, too bad for the dude. Yes, he did not know, he might not have condoned it, and he might have stopped it if he knew what was going on. But those were his men, and he ultimately has to take responsibilities for their actions. Thats what a leader should be about. At least it will teach the next guy in the job to make sure those below him play by the rules.<br><br>Nathan G5, no doubt the Chief Cdo would have been told to "Shape up of ship out" after the BCU fiasco, he failed to do the 1st and simple logic follows that the 2nd happened.</div>
