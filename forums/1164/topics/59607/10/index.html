            <div class='col-md body'>He is obviously under the misconception that training does not produce real soldiers unless it kills, maims, drowns, or disables a noticable percentage of them. Apparently he is unable to seperate the concept of tough training from dangerous, irresponsible and ultimately sensless training.<br><br>Therefore, it is not surprising that he thinks that instructors must be protected from wrongdoing, and be able to do as they deem fit. On the other hand, trainees should shut up and realize that they have no rights. What this implies in the end that irresponsible and sadastic instructors with more mind to torture then train can be allowed to run amok in the army with no checks and measures because this is what is needed for a tough army.<br><br>Sun Zhu stated that a commander must also have a balance of morals along with his hardness, or else it's just a recipe for disaster, nobody will really fight for you if all you want them to risk life and limb for you, but in the end show no regard for their wellfare or rights?<br><br>As I stated and will contuine to state, training  can be tough but at the same time made as safe as possible. And training that drowns one person and seriously injures six others is not something to be condoned!<br><br>If 35MM Gunner can pull his head out of the sand and stop for a moment from broadcasting his instructors right rethoric, he would see the immediate and apparent logic that has been before him all this while.<br><br>If not, maybe he should run through a taste of his own dream military which is a cold hearted insitution that is more determined to create mindless, dehumanized killing machines via "walking the walk" with training no different from actual combat.<br><br>Hey maybe our medics should get to treat some real combat wounds as well? Our soldiers can also get a chance to taste and learn how to survive getting shot. Maybe next time in war games we can use real ammo? Just make sure that only the arms and legs are the only locations that are allowed to be shot at and if anyone died from getting shot, it is an acceptable statistic to create a tough army.<br><br>Wu liao, what more illogical absurdities can 35MM Gunner come up with?</div>

To the guy who writes up the lesson plan: Use "to shower the trainees with water from an elevated container x meters above the tallest trainees' head" instead of the current language. I know from a scholastic perspective, it may be "beneath" your years of higher, sponsored or self-paid ivory-tower learning, but the masses of us need to understand what you are trying to communicate.<br><br></div>
