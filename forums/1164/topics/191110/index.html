            <div class='col-md body'>U.S. congressman seeks assurances on Yasukuni<br>05/15/2006<br>THE ASAHI SHIMBUN<br><br>A senior U.S. congressman has demanded assurances that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi will not visit Yasukuni Shrine if he is to make a speech to a joint session of Congress in June, sources said.<br>In a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Dennis Hastert in late April, Henry Hyde asked that Koizumi take steps to reassure Congress that he would not visit Yasukuni any time soon after his unprecedented address to the joint session.<br>Without the assurance, Koizumi's visit to Capitol Hill would dishonor the place where Franklin Roosevelt made his "day of infamy" speech after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, wrote Hyde, who is chairman of the House Committee on International Relations.<br>In Tokyo, officials were quick to play down any effect the letter might have on Japan-U.S. relations.<br>Some government sources went so far as to deny that Japan is seeking an opportunity for Koizumi to address a joint session of the House and the Senate, which would be a first for a Japanese prime minister.<br>At the same time, the Republican congressman said he was concerned about the possible fallout from a visit to Yasukuni Shrine by Koizumi, especially on or near Aug. 15, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.<br>Hyde pointed out that, along with the rest of Japan's war dead, Yasukuni venerates 14 Class-A war criminals, including Hideki Tojo, the prime minister when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, forcing the United States to enter the war.<br>Hyde said that for the generation that remembers Pearl Harbor, a visit by Koizumi to Yasukuni soon after a speech to Congress would be an affront.<br>Both houses of Congress must give their consent for someone to address a joint session. So far, concerns about Koizumi making a speech have not been raised in the Senate.<br>Sources said Hastert had yet to respond to Hyde's letter.<br>Hyde was first elected to the U.S. House in 1974. A Navy veteran, Hyde saw action in the Philippines during World War II.<br>Last fall, Hyde sent a letter to Japanese Ambassador Ryozo Kato, saying he is concerned about Koizumi's repeated visits to Yasukuni.<br>When the issue has come up, it is usually in connection with the impact on Japan's relationship with China and South Korea.<br>However, sources in Koizumi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party said this latest incident underscores the importance of the Yasukuni issue. Its effect on Japan's relationship with its Asian neighbors is likely to play a lead role in the selection of Koizumi's successor when he steps down in September, they said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>President Roh Draws Dokdo Map for Kofi Annan<br>Updated May.16,2006 22:23 KST<br>http://english.chosun.com<br><br>President Roh Moo-hyun and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday exchanged ideas on Korea-Japan relations and other international affairs at a luncheon meeting on Tuesday.<br>Roh was quoted as telling Annan that Japanese leaders forget the fact that their country occupied Dokdo during the Russo-Japanese War. He said a fundamental resolution would not be easy, so it was important for Japan to show sincerity in the matter and acknowledge historical facts. The president reportedly took it upon himself to draw a map for Annan of the Korean Peninsula and the islets and explained the history of Japan's occupation of the territory.<br><br>Annan said his Korea visit made him realize just how big the issue of Korean-Japanese relations is. The UN chief was quoted as saying he wondered if it might be possible for the countries of East Asia to come together just as victors and losers came together for a ceremony to mark the 50th Anniversary of World War II.<br><br>Roh also explained the peculiarities of the inter-Korean relationship and outlined efforts by the government in consideration of these aspects. Annan expressed support for six-nation talks aimed at ending the NorthÂ’s nuclear program and said he hoped they will resume soon.<br><br>The first lady and Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon also attended the luncheon.</div>
