The soldiers then rounded up and massacred 25 Chinese villagers and burnt many of the dwellings. When word leaked out, the authorities attempted to justify the killings by saying that the victims had been detainees who had tried to escape:<br><br>There matters rested until, 20 years later, The People, a London newspaper, challenged a statement by George Brown, a leading Labour Party politician, discussing revelations of the My Lai massacre [by Americans in Vietnam], that ... Â“there are an awful lot of spectres in our cupboard too...Â”<br><br>... Among those who read this challenge was a Scots Guardsman who had been a member of the patrol. Eventually, he and three other members of the patrol swore statements on oath to the effect that the 25 Chinese had been massacred and that they were not trying to escape. The victims, moreover, were all civilians, and Â“this is just one of the many British My LaiÂ’s in MalayaÂ”.[27]<br><br><a href="http://www.troopsoutmovement.com/oliversarmychap5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.troopsoutmovement.com/oliversarmychap5.htm</a><br><br>British war crimes must not be forgotten.......just like Japanese war crimes.....pui......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in war, everything and anything goes.  the victor will claim the loser committed war crimes and those similar acts done by them are justified.  its just how this world is.<br><br>Do we see any US soldiers / leaders being prosecuted for napalm bombing vietnam ?  Do we see any war crime actions against their mass killing of villages?  No.  How about in Iraq where their so called smart bombs mistakenly bomb innocent villages - isn't that considered war crimes?</div>

He can't be that stupid and anger China for nothing.<br><br>IMO he has another motive entirely for these well-publicised visits to the shrine:<br><br>It is a gesture meant for Japanese society. Not to anger foreigners etc.<br><br>...<br><br>Why?<br><br>In Japan there is a quiet underground surge of Nationalism and a quest for return to the old ways and a strong Japan.<br><br>This is not something started by the young generation but by the old and dying generation - some of whom are the real powerful people in Japanese  society.<br><br>(The young generation don't give a shxt - and therein lies the problem.)<br><br>...<br><br>I suspect the Prime Minister's power backers are from this lot of old-fashioned ultra right-wing nationalists.<br><br>And his annual trips is required of him by these backers. He is going there not to mourn the dead but to demonstrate to Janese society that he, a young leader - values the old ways and is there to pay respects to a past generation who embodied the true smaurai "Bushido" spirit.<br><br>...<br><br>These nationalists mourn the death of the Bushido spirit that made Japan mighty.<br><br>They want Japan to stand proud and not be a lackey of US any more as this is rotting Japanese society core values.<br><br>They want to see Japan re-arm. They don't necessarily want to be militarily adventurous. But they want Japan to be a proper country again without the restrictions set upon them after WW2.<br><br>These nationalists hate the weakness of Japanese young generation. Instead of being honourable and ready to sacrifice for Japanese society, today's Jap youth are weak and direction-less.<br><br>...<br><br>Though this is just my theory, I have read articles here and there that pointed to a re-emergence of nationalism in Japan. And also the fact is before our eyes that Japan IS re-arming. Though it is my theory that besides military reasons, they are doing it for national pride and to give nationhood a kick start again.<br><br>Somehow, it is inescapable that a strong sense of nationhood needs a strong military. Countries that do not have a strong military have only a country, not a nation. And they might lose even that...<br><br>I don't like the idea of a re-emergence of nationalism in Japan but they are doing what is best for their society.<br><br>...<br><br>Foreign soldiers in your country is bad news, as these revelations about British atrocities reveals. We all thought they were great chums but see what they are capable of. Racially, they still think of us as somehow inferior.<br><br>That's why we cannot depend on ANYONE to help.</div>

However the way to do it is not to look back upon the dark days and deeds of the past as if they were glory days and need to be relived, but instead focus on creating a Japan that was "what it should have been" and avoided all those mistakes.</div>

Unit 731 had many branches spread all over the Japanese empire with one in Singapore (tropical diseases and Malaria Branch), one in Manchukuo (present day Dong Bei). However, the HQ of Unit 731 was in Ping Fan in Harbin where a complex of more than a 100 buildings were build.<br><br>After the war, the American wanted to prevent the biological research data from falling into the hands of the Soivet granted immunity in exchange for the blood knowledge. General Ishii, the head of Unit 731, forced his staff to swore secrecy to what happend in Ping Fan during the War. Ishii was never prosecuted and he died of throat cancer in his home living into his 60s. Since then, other members of Unit 731 have come up to acknowledge their actions during their service in the Unit, some repentant and some proud of what they have done. Other personnel of the unit became well known medical professional in a Japan after the war. Not one member of Unit 731 was ever put on trial and convicted for their crimes and only one statement was ever mentioned bout biological research in the Far East Military Tribunal Trial held in Tokyo.<br><br>Compared to Nazi doctors such as Karl Brandt (who was executed), Josef Mengele (Auschwitz doctor known as the Angel of Death but escaped trial), the extent and crime of the Japanese biological research is hardly known by people.</div>
