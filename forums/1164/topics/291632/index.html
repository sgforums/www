            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Caliber: 40mm (others possible)<br>Type: stacked-projectile, caseless multishot system<br>Overall length: n/a<br>Weight: n/a<br>Effective range: up to 400 m<br>Capacity: 3 shots (current 40mm model, single barrel)<br><br>The Metal Storm grenade launching system is a radical step from most conventional firearms. Using the ancient principle of an "Roman candle", Metal Storm weapon systems currently are promoted in a variety of calibers and applications. One of such applications is the 40mm, multi-shot grenade launcher, that could be either mounted on the infantry rifle to create an enchanced-capability infantry weapon like the Australian AICW system, or to be mounted on stationary or vehicle platforms in multi-barrel configurations.<br><br>Key advantage of Metal Storm system is its mechanic simplicity. In fact, the standard Metal Storm grenade launching unit is no more than a single rifled barrel, loaded with several projectiles, stacked one upon the another. There are no loading mechanisms, no feed units nor magazines or belts - each barrel is a magazine itself. Projectiles are fired using powder charges, located in the hollow hase of each projectile, and there's no case left to extract and eject after each shot; Powder is ignited by the electric ignition system, wired to the electrinic fire control module through small ports in the wall of the barrel. When user press the firing button or trigger, electronic fire control module sends the ignition impulse to the charge of the foremost projectile in the stack; when trigger is pressed for the second time, module ignites the second charge and then next, until barrel is empty. Once all the rounds in the barrel are shoot out, it can be removed from the host and then either collected and later sent to factory for reloading, or simply discarded.<br>Current 40mm grenade launching module, developed for the AICW rifle/GL system, contains three grenades stacked one in front of another in single barrel. Each barrel has an electronic interface which is connected to the fire control unit, built into the host platform. This is about the simplest systems, at least from the operator's point of view (from developer's point of view, there's plenty of complications and difficulties, most of which seems to be already overcome). However, there is one drawback when Metal Storm system is compared to existing mechanically or manually reloaded systems - latter systems still can be fired once batteries are dry; Metal Storm always require some sort of electric power to operate. This problem may seem critical, especially for military purposes, but, actually, it is not. For example, several Soviet/Russian anti-tank grenade launchers (like RPG-16 or RPG-29) are built using electric rocket ingnition; necessary electricity is provided by the magneto-impulse generators, powered by the pull of the trigger. Same idea also could be possibly applied to the Metal Storm system. </blockquote><a href="http://world.guns.ru/grenade/gl18-e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://world.guns.ru/grenade/gl18-e.htm</a><br><br>If i am not wrong Singapore have tied up with the Australians on Metal Storm technology. So i am wondering if we have developed a similar multi-shot grenade launcher for our SAR-21 much like what they have done to their Steyr-AUG. I think it is possible as both the SAR-21 and the Steyr are of bull-pup designs. Check out the link for a diagram.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Caseless ammunition means you save on the weight of the gunpower required to fire the warhead so you save space reqiured for the casing as well.<br><br>What i find about the metal storm is that it's very "inefficient" in terms of sustainability and real ops as of this moment from info available online.<br><br>1) You need 20 seconds to reload a mag of 4 rounds which can be fired in under 1 second. (Youtube video the one under metal storm live firing near the end)<br><br>2) if you watched the video i mentioned where you have a frontal view of the two men reloading the metal storm, you will notice the bronze ammo tube has a shiny round thing sticking out.  That's the 40mm grenade. I dont know about you but having live ammo half exposed sounds like fireworks in the making to me. Some blur sotong just drop the tube head first  boom...(This is in reference to those who  want to use this on the M203.  Any tired trooper will be tempted to fire all at a go to lighten the load too..no?)<br><br>3) Why metal storm is deadly is because you can launch 100+ 40 mm grenades so closely together that it literally becomes a wall/ munition of larger calibre. Pretty sure that if a 155mm shell lands on a tank, the tank is a goner too.<br>Metal storm provides quick reaction speed but it's draw backs are limited ammo supply and super slow reload vs expending of the ammo.<br>Frankly, i rather they can make guided mortar bombs, fast cheap(not so if they are guided) and sustainable.  One heck of a thing to attack armour with too (*120mm mortars duh)<br><br>4) People may not know but 40mm grenades have really limited combat effective range.  Yeah i know people say 40mm on our AGL is 1+ km, do you know how light is the 40mm grenade that's fired out?  If it's windy or raining, it -will- go off course.<br><br>5) The only thing i find that's actually viable is the usage of Metal Storm on UCAV.  That's only because you can carry alot alot alot of this few shots only weapon, dump the grenades on the high prize target, then return to reload by the tray. Then go round and round. Cheap and effective bombing.<br><br></div>

Some blur sotong just drop the tube head first  boom...(This is in reference to those who  want to use this on the M203.  Any tired trooper will be tempted to fire all at a go to lighten the load too..no?)<br><br>3) Why metal storm is deadly is because you can launch 100+ 40 mm grenades so closely together that it literally becomes a wall/ munition of larger calibre. Pretty sure that if a 155mm shell lands on a tank, the tank is a goner too.<br>Metal storm provides quick reaction speed but it's draw backs are limited ammo supply and super slow reload vs expending of the ammo.<br>Frankly, i rather they can make guided mortar bombs, fast cheap(not so if they are guided) and sustainable.  One heck of a thing to attack armour with too (*120mm mortars duh)<br><br>4) People may not know but 40mm grenades have really limited combat effective range.  Yeah i know people say 40mm on our AGL is 1+ km, do you know how light is the 40mm grenade that's fired out?  If it's windy or raining, it -will- go off course.<br><br>5) The only thing i find that's actually viable is the usage of Metal Storm on UCAV.  That's only because you can carry alot alot alot of this few shots only weapon, dump the grenades on the high prize target, then return to reload by the tray. Then go round and round. Cheap and effective bombing.<br><br></div></blockquote>The rounds are supposedly "Safe".  Since they are fired electrically.  Of course, I'm not referring to a cook off. I doubt any ammunition is "cook off" safe.<br><br>I'm not sure at which point of development they've reached already, but yeah, the last time I checked in, they reloading was still done by hand, with the gun tubes pointing vertically up, and a "loader" hatch position directly under it.  I suppose a loading system would have been right at the top of development priorities? Haha<br><br></div>

That round thing you see is almost identical to what you will find when you find a "dud" of any 40mm ammo.  Anything that relies on -Impact- to activate it's explosives are never safe. Same reason why you dont poke the primer cap of your rounds with a sharp object either. It's been quite a few years since Metal Storm has been around.  From the lack of news i suppose they havent found a solution to the loading system yet. Unless you carry a mobile 40mm grenade making factory along with you, you will run out of ammo before you can say finish :"Ammo loaded"</div>
