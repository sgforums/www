For the most part, our armed forces comprises of NSFs and NSmen, with only a small core of regulars, of which a smaller percentage has seen peacekeeping/peace enforcement action. Well-trained? For sure....experienced? I don't think we are as experienced as the ADF or IDF for that matter.<br><br>Second point, why would M'sia attack us over water? They have plenty of it!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Wouldn't we logically attack them over H2O instead? They don't even need our filtration services for much longer.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Third, the purpose of M'sia's NS is to teach NE before their country falls apart because of ethnic divisions, not to really create community workers...therefore, their NS program is structured more towards NE lessons...the arms training session is just to instil discipline, that's all...a taste of so-called 'roughing it out' but not the comprehensive works...<br><br>Fourth, are we really able to mobilise every TDH as infantrymen? Not all of us that went through NS dealt with firearms, let alone field training; only those that got posted to the SAF or SPF (not even proper field training, although there's some). You're forgetting that the SCDF don't have para-military training...maybe we can have 'em patrol the streets holding pickaxes... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
