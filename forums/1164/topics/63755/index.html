            <div class='col-md body'>While I agree that we are no more "battle-hardened" than them, its also true that their "NS" in no way compares to ours. Their "NS" is just a pathetic excuse at brainwashing, its not for the purpose of war or anything like that.

While the SAF has indeed been involved in peacekeeping and/or peace enforcement operations from time to time, together with our training deployments overseas, it hardly qualifies as being 'battle-hardened.' An example of a battle-hardened would be the U.S., Soviet and British military at the end of WWII. That's battle-hardened...<br><br>break it down even to the company level...look at Band of Brothers...from boot camp to jump school to Normandy and beyond...conscripts just like we were too....the BIG difference is that they have been in a sustained conflict for a period of time. No SAF personnel eversince the Konfrontasi has been involved in a shooting war that could reasonably justify the term 'battle-hardened.' The SAF is simply highly operationally ready, i.e we ARE ready for war, but we have NOT seen conflict.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The water issue is not as relevant in terms of SAF's security calculations. Not with Newater, desalination, etc...We can overcome that vulnerability. What we canot overcome is our energy resource vulnerability. Even if they have 'big bones' to pick with us, their NS program isn't geared towards addressing their military capabilities or lack thereof; its more to prevent ethnic fragmentation in their country. When you perceive something to be a threat, you automatically materialize that threat without taking into consideration other factors involved...can they really afford to go to war with us? Can we really afford to engage in a conflict with M'sia? The point of SAF is simply deterrence....and a highly credible one at that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

However, we don't have the space and so I feel it's important to have what Tango1 described or something closer.<br><br>But as you mentioned, the whole of asia is likewise as Singapore.<br><br>Still, living in cosmopolitan city with THE LOWEST SEX DRIVE in the world versus agri-based neighbors puts us at a disadvantage too.<br><br>Not enough OOMPH!</div>

We need instructions like those given to conscripts before entering stalingrad. End.<br>Let's not use "battlehardened", eh? Rather "well-trained and experienced".<br><br>SG has already done NS for decades, and has most of the kinks ironed out. M'Sia is starting now, and will have many stuff to straigthen before they have good community workers, let alone troops.<br><br>In a very real sense, NS has created a nation of riflemen in singapore, albeit not to the extent of sweden.
