Roger King said. It was not clear how they had been injured.<br><br>"You think about the sacrifice these guys made, especially in this case where you've got military personnel who are conducting a flight that's basically a humanitarian mission," King added. "They're trying to go out and save some Afghan kid's life Â— it's wrenching."<br><br>The remains of the six people on board Â— all Air Force members Â— have been recovered and were to be flown to Bagram Air Base and prepared for transfer back to the United States, King said.<br><br>"The investigation will probably bear out as to whether weather played any part in it."<br><br>There were thunderstorms in the area when the helicopter went down, King said.<br><br>King said the area is not considered a hostile region, and there are few U.S. military operations there.<br><br>Press officer Master Sgt. Richard Breach said the cause of the crash was being investigated but: "This is not believed to be the result of enemy action."<br><br>U.S. Central Command confirmed that the helicopter was not shot down.<br><br>"The names of those killed are being withheld until their next of kin can be notified," Moody Air Force Base spokeswoman Lt. Alysia Harvey said early Monday.<br><br>The helicopter crashed late Sunday about 8:50 p.m., some 20 miles north of Ghazni, Afghanistan, according to officials at Bagram Air Base, north of the capital, Kabul. Ghazni lies 50 miles southwest of Kabul.<br><br>U.S. military officials in Washington and Afghanistan said the medical emergency and the helicopter flight were not in connection with Operation Valiant Strike, a mission involving members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division in southeastern Afghanistan.<br><br>That mission, which began earlier this month, is meant to root out remnants of the al-Qaida and Taliban believed to be operating in the area.<br><br>"The Air Force is a close-knit family and the loss of one of our own affects us all," Brig. Gen. John Folkerts, commander of the 347th Rescue Wing at Moody, said in a statement. The air force base is located in Valdosta, Ga.<br><br>"We wish to express our deepest condolences to the family members of these brave airmen and want them to know that we will not forget the valuable contributions they made to this country and the impact they made on the Air Force," Folkerts said.<br><br>Ten days ago, about 20 gunmen fired on a U.S. special forces convoy on the road between the town of Gardez, about 40 miles to the east of the crash, and Khost. The attack led to a firefight involving coalition F-16 and A-10 aircraft and a half-dozen of Apache helicopters. Five of the assailants were killed, and there were no coalition casualties.<br><br>The last helicopter crash in Afghanistan was Jan. 30, when an Army Black Hawk helicopter Â— the Army's version of the Pave Hawk Â— on a training mission crashed near the Bagram air base, killing four.<br><br></div>
