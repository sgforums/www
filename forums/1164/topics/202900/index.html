Kim Tae-hoon of the Joint Chiefs of Staff office.<br><br>South Korean soldiers immediately fired back six rounds, Kim said.<br><br>He said South Korea does not know what prompted the North troops to open fire and the secretive communist country has not said anything to the South about it.<br><br>The U.N. Military Armistice Commission, which supervises the cease-fire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, will asked the North on Tuesday for an explanation of the incident.<br><br>The fighting ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, meaning that the two Koreas are still technically in a state of conflict.<br><br>Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.

            <div class='col-md body'>SEOUL : A brief exchange of gunfire erupted between South and North Korean troops on the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, but no casualties were reported, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Tuesday.<br><br>The shootout occurred at 7:35pm (1035 GMT) on Monday in Yanggu, 175 kilometres (108 miles) northeast of Seoul, on the border, the office said in a statement.<br><br>"North Korean soldiers first fired two bullets at a South Korean guard post which immediately fired back six shots at them," a JCS spokesman said.<br><br>"No more gunfire followed. There were no casulties on our side."<br><br>One of the two North Korean bullets hit the wall of the South's post, but caused no damage to equipment there, he added.<br><br>It was not immediately known what triggered the incident and whether there were any casulties on the North Korean side.<br><br>The two Koreas have been technically at war since the 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.<br><br>Shooting incidents at the border are rare.<br><br>Three years ago South Korean troops returned fire after North Koreans unleashed several bursts of machine gun fire. No casualties were reported.<br><br>New tensions have flared up since North Korea defiantly test-fired seven ballistic missiles on July 5 and sparked UN Security Council condemnation and weapons-related sanctions on the communist state.<br><br>The provocative missile test also strained inter-Korean ties, which have steadily improved since a 2000 peace summit between the leaders of both Koreas.<br><br>Seoul suspended its rice and other humanitarian aid to its impoverished northern neighbor in protest at the missile tests.<br><br>North Korea has also been locked in a prolonged standoff with the United States and its allies over its nuclear weapons programme. - AFP/ch<br><br>Personally, the north is trying to provoke again but hopefully nothing comes out of this incident.<br><br></div>
