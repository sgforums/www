What he is saying is a he want something like our LSD ( which we use for support role) with landing pad for heli (aircraft). Or a more delicated supply ship which usually also have landpad.

Now if they decided to use it as a mini carrier, you think they can just do so overnight? Obviously it takes time to modify the ship. And not forgetting, none of their current fighter jets can take off from a mini carrier. They have not made known any plans to get VTOL jets and even IF they do, its gonna take several years to shortlist, decide, buy, train their pilots &amp; support staff, etc.<br><br>In other words, SHOULD they decide to convert their support ship to a mini-carrier, its gonna take several years for their carrrier capable jets to be ready. In other words, they'll have a carrier without fighter jets.

Thats how they bought their Migs from Russia.<br><br>In any case, theres nothing to worry about.  They may buy an equipement but it does not comes with spare parts, so they have to buy an extra identical equipement to use its parts for replacement.  Thats why they spend so much.<br><br>Military toys are serious spending money, you may buy EWAC but you don't have the fundings to maintane the aircraft, so what happens after 5 years in service?</div>

I see that it is better if Malaysia mature it's airlift capability to boost it's current projection capability then later move on talking about more projection.<br><br>Inorder to achieve that level of projection, i see that the RMAF and RMN have to be modernised to reach a level of supremacy or excellence if not all projections in this region will be futile. Power projections will be halt if the carrier can negotiate the threat environment.<br><br>I see that Malaysia will be better off purchasing the old wish items such as the Roovaik, F/A-18F, more Astros2 etc then to procue a carrier fleet. I think Malaysia will be better with an all rounded upgrade rather than a directed upgrade in the field of projection in this field. The CDF will be wise to upgrade the navy with a few newer LSTs or light LPDs, if not such directional move will bring no benefits.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the french Mistral LHDs that they have ordered will be a pure Helo carrier according to reports becos the french is not planning to operate any fixed wing a/c on it, thus it will not come with a skip jump as shown in CGI.<br><br>It will be a flat deck for helo only.<br><br>The OZ requirement of two LHD might have them if they select the Mistral, cos it was reported that the OZ intend to operate STOVL JSF on their projected LHDs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a whole gamut of equipment they have proposed to buy in thier wish-list; but limited funds. The MAF has more important considerations than buying a `Mistral' class ship and letting go other purchases. For the RMN alone, there are 2 Lekiu Block 2 frigates, more Meko corvettes, proper armaments for the latter,etc  to consider. This `mistral' proposal, if any,  would come at the end of that wish-list.  For a navy the size/nature of the RMN, it would be more than a trifle ambitious to put to sea a ship the size of the Mistral. Also, what maritime helicopters do they intend to deploy?
