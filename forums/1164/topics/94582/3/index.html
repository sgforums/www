            <div class='col-md body'>Really, if you look carefully at the Malaysian ORBAT, you will recognise that they have standardised on certain items, eg. MM40, VL-Seawolf SAM, and perhaps the SU-30 to replace the F/A-18D.  This shows a coherrent thought about arms purchases coming from the Malaysian high command.  They are able to buy weapon systems that will extend the effectiveness of whatever they are building.  This is good, because it will lead to better defence collaboration with Singapore and better integration of arms on their side.<br><br>However, we still have people in Singapore who persist in a dream-like Indonesia/Malaysia assault on Singapore.

I am one who hates war. In fact, i fear war. Every good soldier will definately say that. A soldier who loves war  does not know the responsibilities that he has to shoulder for himself. However, i have faith that the governments in our respective countries are responsible enough to know that war does no good.<br>But if you people boh dai bo ji go and flame malaysia or whatever other countries,  and they decide to get their kakhis to come here and start a flame war, i tell you, both they and you will get into deep shit. You want them to respect you, you must show that you respect them first. Otherwise I wun give face to either side. So discuss this topic if you want, talk about how the two militaries can complement each other, or how their new purchase will influence their capabilities. But don't you dare drag it into a singapore vs malaysia flame thread.</div>
