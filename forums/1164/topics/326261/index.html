              <p>The airship nowadays is not those used in world war 2 anymore, it is much faster, safer and high tech. Take a look at this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyHook_JHL-40<br>It is also not filled with hydrogen, but helium.<br>We are now talking about tranportation, military is only one of the areas that can make use of it. Even if the body is made of the same material like other aeroplanes, it takes the same number of missile to be killed. Not to mention this airship is not for fighting at the front if it is ever used for military purpose.</p>

              <p>An airship can be very heavy, the full load capacity can be 100 tonnes or even more. Although it has equivalent power to lift it up, but doesn't mean any wind of normal strength can blow it away so easily.<br>It can land at any area without the need of runway, and not being blocked by ocean or hill.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As for the floating petrol station, it can provide fuel to helicopter in many ways. One way is to build a small landing area on the airship for the helicopter to land, repair and replenish before continuing the trip.<br>Since we going to own F-35 which is capable of vertical landing. Then this floating petrol station can apply to F-35 as well thus double or triple the combat range.<br>Why not use ship instead of airship to refuel petrol? Speed is one concern, most importantly airship can ignore any geographic hindrance.<br><br>We can even improve the AWACS airship, and make it like a small flying carrier to station unmanned aircrafts which is smaller and more stealthy. The radar should have larger detection range than enemy aircrafts, so when it detect any approaching enemy aircraft, it will launch some unmanned aircrafts to counter strike. The unmanned aircrafts in order to remain stealth, can just rely on the AWACS to track the location of the enemy aircraft.</p></div>

              <p>Haha, I think you misunderstand the concept of either mid-air refueling or airships.</p>
              <p>For aircraft to tank in mid air, both the tanker and the aircraft needs to be level and moving at about 300kts.  So its as large and slow as a regular KC-135, and the KC-135 is MANNED.</p>
