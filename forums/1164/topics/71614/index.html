            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a multi-racial nation. no such thing as mandarin domination. u hear mandarin more ? cos of population ratio....u go everywhere also got English and Chinese translation becos English is well-known to all of us, we were taught English since we in kindergarden. Chinese is because we might have people who dunno English well....dats why u see some uncle aunties reading Lian He Zao/Wan Bao. Another factor is because of foreign talents from China as their English is not so good.<br><br>Regarding foreign talent, it is vital for the government to employ them so we can benchmark against other nations. If we only employ Singaporeans, there is no drive to improve oneselves. With the introduction of foreign talents, Singaporeans will strive to improve themselves and all these will help improve Singapore's economy. We have no raw materials....hope you understand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYi, BG Lee is not the Supreme Commander of the SAF.But i agree with you that to solve our current problems, we cannot afford to hide behind excuses and shallow reasoning, especially for the ones who are <strong>entrusted</strong> with running our country.The distinction made a long time ago that the government is here to serve has long been forgotten, and now we see our country being run like a corporation and our voices are not valued in a world where only the bottomline matters...<br><br>I seriously hope our youth , being screwed up their behind with illogically timed policies and incoherent and unrealistic demands made on them as if they were mechanical widgets.If there is violent form or catharissi like the violence of Japanese teens and their self-imposed isolation from their world, sad will be too mild a word to use.We need change and the world waits for no man, let alone  former soldiers running a country that had no right to exist but by the foresight of our Old Guard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think things in Singapore are great. They are not as good as the boom years of the 90's, but those were the exception, not the rule. I think that too many Singaporeans have grown to regard that sort of an environment as "normal". Many people on this forum are young, and your entire childhood (entire life actually) has been in the midst of an economic boom, so it may seem like the world is ending. It is actually just returning to normal. From the state of the economy, everything else springs.<br><br>As for the political situation, things have improved a lot, and they continue to improve. Lee Hsien Loong will not have anywhere near the level of power his father enjoyed. The press is also much freer -- if you don't like a conservative newspaper like ST, read the liberal Today, or simply look around the Internet. The civil service has always been open to anyone -- it is not an aristocracy. Anyone can rise through the service, though your effort must begin in childhood at school.<br><br>The military situation is as it has always been. No matter what, we are not a battle-tested force, and if all goes well that will remain so. Battle is the primary means of eliminating incompetent commanders, and we lack it. Fortunately, the SAF personnel system at least seems to eliminate useless officers before they reach COL, and bad NCOs before WO2 -- I have never seen a bad colonel, general or warrant (especially the last). Screw ups are simply a fact of life in any organization of hundreds of thousands of men, so I am not too worried there.<br></div>
