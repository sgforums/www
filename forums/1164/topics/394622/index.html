              <p>The Scar-H will become the backbone of the regiment, with its 7.62mm and a twenty round clip and the L variant will replace the M4 carbine and the M16 series weapons which are outdated.</p>
              <p>About 600 members of the 75th Ranger Regiment will soon take the Special Operations Combat Assault Rifle into battle.</p>
              <p>The
              600 SCARs are the first of 1,800 that U.S. Special Operations Command
              began fielding in early April, SOCom spokeswoman Air Force Maj. Denise
              Boyd told Army Times.</p>
              <p>SOCom chose the SCAR system — which
              consists of the 5.56mm MK16 and the 7.62mm MK17 — to replace weapons
              including the 5.56mm M4A1 carbine, made by Colt Defense LLC.</p>

              <p>The command selected FN Herstal to develop SCAR in 2004 after
              holding a competition to find a reliable, modular weapon system for its
              elite forces.</p>
              <p>The SCAR has a short-stroke, gas-piston operating
              system. The upper receiver is aluminum and houses a free-floating
              barrel for improved accuracy. The lower receiver is polymer to help
              reduce weight. Both versions can be equipped with different barrel
              lengths to suit missions ranging from close-quarter fights to
              long-range shooting.</p>
              <p>Operators can chose a 10-inch, 14-inch or
              18-inch barrel for the MK16 and a 13-inch, 16-inch or 20-inch barrel
              for the heavier MK17. Each of these can be changed out by the shooter
              in minutes, FN officials say. The MK16 uses a 30-round magazine; the
              MK17 uses a 20-rounder. Eighty percent of the parts are common to both
              the light and heavy versions to reduce long-term maintenance costs, FN
              officials say.</p>
              <p>The SCAR also includes the MK13 40mm grenade
              launcher, designed to fit on both the MK16 and MK17 or fire in the
              stand-alone mode.</p>
              <p>Like the M4A1, both versions of the SCAR can
              fire on full automatic. The conventional Army’s M4 carbine uses a
              three-round burst instead of full auto.</p>
              <p>In addition to the M4A1, the SCAR system is intended to replace:</p>
              <p>• The MK18 close quarter battle rifle, similar to the M4A1 but equipped with a 10.5-inch barrel.</p>
              <p>• The MK11 special purpose rifle, chambered in 7.62mm.</p>
              <p>• The MK12 special purpose rifle, chambered in 5.56mm.</p>
              <p>• The M14 rifle, chambered in 7.62mm.</p>
              <p>SOCom
              and FN officials do not talk about the cost of SCAR, but the Nov. 5,
              2004, initial award for the contract was $634,390. Special operations
              units from all services will receive the SCAR, but it’s unclear when
              that will happen, Boyd said; commanders are determining how many they
              will need.</p>
              <p>“The intent is to field to operational elements at the
              beginning of their training cycle and to run the weapons through an
              entire work-up and deployment in order to determine weapon mix, barrel
              mix, total number of weapons required,” Boyd said.</p>
              <p>This should be interesting since the SCAR is now fielded in Iraq and yet remains to see how it will perform in battles</p>
