            <div class='col-md body'>Still remember how during the SARS crisis, China had the cheek to say that S'pore was a poor friend who did not help EVEN THOUGH we donated several fever detection machines to them?  That shows you what a grateful "friend" China is.  And how about the Suzhou park incident?<br><br>When China needs your assistance, they know how to smile.  But when they are finished with you, they show you their true colours.  Some of my former colleagues from China even said "We China ppl can not be trusted".  I admire him for his truth &amp; honesty!!<br><br>The recent spate about DPM Lee's visit to China show how China dabbles in double standards. When the US or other countries talk about China, China makes noise &amp; says its an internal affair &amp; other ppl should not interfere. But China interferes with S'pore's internal affairs when DPM Lee goes to Taiwan. They don't want ppl to meddle in their affairs, but they meddle in ppl's affairs. Dumb communists!!<br><br></div>
