The cost of the weapons were not revealed.<br><br><strong>Under the pact between China National Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp. and two local companies, CNPMIEC would transfer technology on production of the FN-6 shoulder-launched missiles to Malaysia if it purchases its medium-range KS-1A missiles, Bernama said.</strong><br><br>This includes provisions for special test facilities, tools, manufacturing process document, training and technical support.<br><br>CNPMIEC president Wang Bingyan said China had also offered to conclude the KS-1A transaction on flexible payment terms, including counter-trade, barter and deferred payments.<br><br>Malaysia has procured very short-range air defence systems from Russia, Pakistan and Britain under the Eight Malaysian Plan from 2001-2005, Bernama said.<br><br>The government has in the past two years embarked on a major arms procurement spree, ranging from Russian Sukhoi fighter jets and British missile systems to French submarines and Polish attack tanks.<br><br>Malaysia has denied its weapons build-up could spark an arms race in the region, saying the purchases are simply designed to upgrade its defences and that it has no aggressive intentions.<br><br><img src="http://forum.keypublishing.co.uk/attachment.php?attachmentid=33209&amp;stc=1"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry I will tell mindef to buy the THEL and MTHEL (Tactical High Energy Laser)<br><br>The Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) program is a key component of U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation designed to counter short-range rockets. Israel faces a constant threat from Hezbollah-guerillas staging attacks on its northern border. The THEL, still in developmental stages, will serve to protect Israeli troops and civilians in advent of these affronts.The THEL precursor, the Nautilus, destroyed a short-range rocket in flight during testing in February 1996 at a site in New Mexico, nine months after the project was launched. This was the first time a laser has ever destroyed a ballistic missile.<br>In April 1996 the U.S. agreed to accelerate high energy laser development after Hezbollah guerrillas fired over two dozen of Katyusha rockets at Israel during its 17-day period operation against the terrorists. Soon after, both President Clinton and former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry have pledged to expand work on the THEL.<br><br>THEL will be a transportable laser weapon system which will be used by both the Israeli Defense Forces and eventually will have applications for the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command and the Israel Ministry of Defense are managing the program and the test program is conducted at the High Energy Laser Test Facility (HELSTF) in New Mexico.<br><br>The system is capable of intercepting both the Katyushas in the hands of the Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Kassam missiles fired at Israel from Gaza, controlled by the Palestinian Authority. These missiles are also liable to be stationed in the West Bank, from where they could threaten Ben Gurion Airport.<br><br>The choice of the Israeli and US companies' concept was a preliminary step in producing an operational prototype of the MTEL, the mobile version of the THEL. Production is scheduled for completion in 2004, and the project is slated to end in 2007.<br><br>The laser could be in use in 2007. Since development began in 1996, the Army, the Israeli Defense Ministry and TRW had spent $250 million on the project through 2002<br><br>The (MTHEL) Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser is a short-range weapon being developed with Israel, which wants it to destroy Katyusha rockets fired at its border villages by Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. The weapon looks like a searchlight. In tests during late 2002, the Army used the high-energy laser to heat artillery shells, which exploded in flight. In earlier tests, the laser shot down 25 Katyushas, both singly and in salvos. Artillery shells generate far less heat than rockets do and are more difficult to track. Also, because rockets are pressurized, they are easier to blow up than shells.<br>The MTHEL is being designed to protect soldiers from artillery and mortar rounds and rockets. the laser system can be packed into about three tractor-trailer loads, he said. The next phase will shrink it to less than one load. Ultimately, it will be small enough to mount on a Humvee.<br></div>

If China ever reclaim taiwan by force, I predict it will inherit the most troublesome seperatist province ever, with nearly every male citizen becoming a potential freedom fighter well trained in the armed forces as well as handling of sophisticated arms to deal with.<br><br>good luck!</div>
