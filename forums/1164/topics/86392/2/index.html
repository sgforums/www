Israel faces a constant threat from Hezbollah-guerillas staging attacks on its northern border. The THEL, still in developmental stages, will serve to protect Israeli troops and civilians in advent of these affronts.The THEL precursor, the Nautilus, destroyed a short-range rocket in flight during testing in February 1996 at a site in New Mexico, nine months after the project was launched. This was the first time a laser has ever destroyed a ballistic missile.<br>In April 1996 the U.S. agreed to accelerate high energy laser development after Hezbollah guerrillas fired over two dozen of Katyusha rockets at Israel during its 17-day period operation against the terrorists. Soon after, both President Clinton and former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry have pledged to expand work on the THEL.<br><br>THEL will be a transportable laser weapon system which will be used by both the Israeli Defense Forces and eventually will have applications for the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command and the Israel Ministry of Defense are managing the program and the test program is conducted at the High Energy Laser Test Facility (HELSTF) in New Mexico.<br><br>The system is capable of intercepting both the Katyushas in the hands of the Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Kassam missiles fired at Israel from Gaza, controlled by the Palestinian Authority. These missiles are also liable to be stationed in the West Bank, from where they could threaten Ben Gurion Airport.<br><br>The choice of the Israeli and US companies' concept was a preliminary step in producing an operational prototype of the MTEL, the mobile version of the THEL. Production is scheduled for completion in 2004, and the project is slated to end in 2007.<br><br>The laser could be in use in 2007. Since development began in 1996, the Army, the Israeli Defense Ministry and TRW had spent $250 million on the project through 2002<br><br>The (MTHEL) Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser is a short-range weapon being developed with Israel, which wants it to destroy Katyusha rockets fired at its border villages by Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. The weapon looks like a searchlight. In tests during late 2002, the Army used the high-energy laser to heat artillery shells, which exploded in flight. In earlier tests, the laser shot down 25 Katyushas, both singly and in salvos. Artillery shells generate far less heat than rockets do and are more difficult to track. Also, because rockets are pressurized, they are easier to blow up than shells.<br>The MTHEL is being designed to protect soldiers from artillery and mortar rounds and rockets. the laser system can be packed into about three tractor-trailer loads, he said. The next phase will shrink it to less than one load. Ultimately, it will be small enough to mount on a Humvee.<br></div></blockquote>doubt..if malaysia put all the missile at JB...that to near for us to  track .. have to react within 5sec from the time it shoot..(tell me if im wrong)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On theory it looks good......but that is where it all ends.<br><br>Firstly, in order to lay that many mines as you claim, you will have to really do it on the quiet, or else you will attract attention from the US, you didn't take their sigint and elint capabilities into consideration, did you?<br><br>And even if you manage to fool the US, that amount of mines would have claim their first victim, most likely a commercial vessel ploying the heavily used shipping lanes, and not only will you bring the US charging in, but very likely the Japanese as well as the Koreans, simply bcos it interrupts with their trade.<br>You will then see a large number of MCMVs in the area with excorts from the sophisticated Japanese and US fleet, not to mention the increasingly capable ROKN.<br><br>Would China risk shooting any of these vessels unwittingly?

My only feeling is that they are really affected and threatened by what has happened in the past i.e. Outer Mongolia's independence and how other countries bullied them when they were poor and down.<br><br>Now that money is pouring in and the military might (and more importantly economic might) is on the ascent, these deep rooted nationalistic feelings based on the past experiences are all pouring out and being vented on any people/incident related with the Taiwanese Question.<br><br>All I can say is that it is going to be such a thorny issue that needs the best and calmest brains from China, US, Taiwan to solve. No military action or simple diplomatic exchange can come and settle the problem. WE don't live in a fairy tale world, unfortunately.</div>
