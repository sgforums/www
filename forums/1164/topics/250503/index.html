            <div class='col-md body'>Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean, commissioned the SAF's new generation float bridge and Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives (CBRE) Defence capability at Marina Bay this evening. The commissioning ceremony was part of the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Singapore Combat Engineers.<br><br>The M3G Float Bridge replaces ageing bridging equipment and significantly enhances the Singapore Army's ability to cross waterways. Besides providing greater mobility and for faster deployment, the new bridging equipment also offers improved carrying capacity and requires less people to operate.<br><br>The commissioning of the CBRE Defence Capability, coupled with the launch of the GR 660 Radiation Surveillance System, marks a major milestone in the CBRE Defence Group's ability to respond to the full spectrum of chemical, biological, radiological and explosives threats to homeland security.<br><br>The M3G Float Bridge and CBRE defence capabilities are another step forward in the Singapore Combat Engineers' transformation journey as part of the 3rd Generation SAF.<br><br>The venue of the commissioning event is significant as the Singapore Combat Engineers was part of the creative team that mooted the idea of the floating platform as a venue for mass spectator events, in view of the closure of the National Stadium to make way for the new Kallang Sports Hub<br><br>Factsheet: M3G (Military Float Bridge/Raft)<br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>The M3G is a high mobility wheeled vehicle that functions as a mobile platform for crossing waterways. The platform was acquired from Germany to replace the ageing fleet of float bridges currently operated by the Singapore Combat Engineers.<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>The M3G is a well-tested and trusted platform. A variant, the M3 is in use by several countries including Germany and UK.<br><br>M3G Military Raft/Float Bridge.<br><br>CAPABILITIES<br><br>The M3G can be configured either as a raft or a float bridge. It can carry up to three 5-tonner trucks and can manoeuvre in water as shallow as 1.05m, reaching speeds of up to 9km/hr when laden. The M3G can be deployed by its 8-man crew within 20 minutes.<br><br>CONCLUSION<br><br>The M3G offers improved carrying capacity, greater mobility, faster deployment and can be operated with fewer personnel. These attributes enable the Singapore Combat Engineers to offer improved mobility for the 3rd Generation SAF.<br><br>Woo hoo! Finally!  Now my unit can move faster liaoz!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This M3G is German made and is bought before the Leopards. Any chance the Leopard purchase is planned before hand which is contradictory to what is being announced, which is we are being approached by the Germans as military sales have to be approved by their parliament?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt it.<br><br>It's definitely easier to sell transport stuff that's already made than those that need to be made.<br><br>Pointless for them to have BOUGHT the leos before buying the M3gs then must wait additional year before the leos can be announced, upgraded and delivered.<br><br>Anyway, it has always been a problem (regarding RCs) that we have highlighted to higher HQ during exercises.  Our current comets and almonds were only so so in being able to surge stuff across rivers in X time.<br><br>THe M3G will help alot in pushing our forces across water bodies quickly.<br><br>I love it.</div>
