              <p>The Defence Ministry on Thursday said a conspiracy could be in play to “sabotage” the main battle tank (MBT) Arjun project, even as Indian Army chief Gen Deepak Kapoor visited the production unit to inspect the tanks after they failed the just-concluded winter trials.</p>
              <p>“The possibility of sabotage needs to be examined,” Minister of State for Defence (Production) Rao Inderjit Singh told reporters in New Delhi.</p>
              <p>“The engines fitted in the tanks were German and were performing well for the past 15 years. I wonder what has happened to them overnight,” Singh said, talking about the reported failures of the tank.</p>
              <p>Gen. Kapoor, meanwhile, visited the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) in Tamil Nadu for a first-hand look at the tank on the shop-floor.</p>
              <p>"Gen. Kapoor along with Defence Secretary (Production) Pradeep Kumar went to the HVF in Avadi (Tamil Nadu) to inspect the tanks," said an army source.</p>
              <p>The army had told a key parliamentary panel earlier this month that the Arjun tank, which has been in development for nearly 36 years, failed to deliver at the just-concluded winter trials. The army said after the winter trials that a lot of improvements had to be carried out before it was satisfied.</p>
              <p>Kapoor and his predecessor JJ Singh have on separate occasions expressed their unhappiness with the tank.</p>
              <p>"What we have today is a mid-level technology. What we need is a tank of international quality," Kapoor said in November.</p>
              <p>JJ Singh had spoken in much the same vein during a major Indian Army exercise in the deserts of Rajasthan in April-May 2007.</p>
              <p>However, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has defended the Arjun tank.</p>
              <p>"Arjun is a proven tank. The defects are pertaining to quality control and production of the tank which can always be fine tuned," a senior DRDO official said.</p>
              <p>Fourteen Arjun tanks were handed over to the Indian Army for user trials last year but were returned to the manufacturer - the Combat Vehicles Development Establishment - with a list of defects.</p>
              <p>These included a deficient fire control system, inaccuracy of its guns, low speeds in tactical areas - principally the desert - and the tank's inability to operate in temperatures over 50 degrees Celsius.</p>
              <p>The army had laid down its qualitative requirement (QR) for the Arjun in 1972. In 1982, it was announced that the prototype was ready for field trials. However, the tank was publicly unveiled for the first time only in 1995.</p>
              <p>Arjun was originally meant to be a 40-tonne tank with a 105 mm gun. It has now grown to a 50-tonne tank with a 120 mm gun.</p>
              <p>The tank was meant to supplement and eventually replace the Soviet-era T-72 MBT that was first inducted in the early 1980s.</p>
              <p>However, delays in the Arjun project, and Pakistan's decision to purchase the T-80 from Ukraine, prompted India to order 310 T-90s, an upgraded version of the T-72, in 2001.</p>
              <p>Of these, 186 were assembled from kits at the HVF at Avadi. An agreement was also signed for the licensed production of another 1,000 T-90s.</p>
              <p>With the development of the Arjun delayed further, India last year signed a fresh contract with Russia to buy another 330 T-90s.</p>

              <p>More trouble for the Indian national defense industries' "Indigenous" projects.</p>
              <p>Another prolonged project after 23 years development, The IAF's LCA- Tejas fighter jet, now faces overweigh problem and GE404 is blamed for underpower, "not flat rated" etc, with the indigenous "Karevi" engine program still searching  for a foreign co-development partner. Any change of the new powerplant means the LCA need to be modified again, which in turn, will request more flight test and more delay even after 23 years:</p>

The Air Force’s reasons that the thrust (with afterburner) generated by the <strong>GE F404 IN20 — 85 kilo Newtons (kN) — is adequate for an aircraft of eight tonnes, but with the Tejas being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overweight by nearly two tonnes</span></strong> it requires a much more powerful engine. The Air Force wants an engine that is capable of delivering a thrust of 100 kN. <br><br>Eurojet, which had made available sophisticated data on the EJ200 to the ADA, has offered to transfer all technology — including the key core technology — on the engine to India. The engine will eventually be manufactured in India. It also claims that the EJ200 meets the Tejas’ technical requirements and very little modifications will be needed to house its engine. <strong>Though Eurojet is confident that its engine will be chosen by the ADA, it will have to beat the challenge from GE, which had made a preliminary presentation on the GE414</strong>. <br><br>Sources in the ADA said that while the EJ200, with a thrust of 90 kN, brings in the latest technology in combat aircraft engines and is lighter and smaller, the heavier GE414 is capable of producing more thrust (97.5 kN). But Eurojet officials said the EJ200, which is the only five-stage compression engine in the world today, has the potential to meet the Air Force’s requirement of 100 kN. <br><br>The workshop was also an indication that the ADA has accepted the Air Force’s contention that the Tejas in its present configuration is unacceptable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003366;">I just wonder how come a delta wing "world lightest fighter", a design used to be popular in 1970s need a futuristic Eurojet 230/270 to satisfy the T/W requirement.</span></p>

              <p>With bureaucratic mentality of the Indian Civil Servants, and the over-bloated self-importance of their position, it is not surprising that there should be a constant debate and politicking to impose personal whims and design on these national defence equipment projects.</p>
              <p>If anyone has any dealings with the Indian Government and its officials, one will understand the length of time taken for India to build its indegeneously designed and manufactured main battle tank for more then 15 years since its conception stage.</p>
              <p>The Indian designed aircraft is already out-of-date after having been stuck in the same quagmire of bureaucratic politiking and power plays that are made worst with a change of political parties that formed the Indian governments over the last 20 years.</p>
              <p>This is the consequence when Government take on the role of industrial management and manufacturing - as each alternative political parties have their own agenda.</p>
              <p>Compared to countries such as Brazil, EU countries, Israel, Japan, South Korea, UK and the USA, it is Private Enterprise that take the initiative and leadership role in privately funding R&amp;D on new technologies - sometimes with Government financial participation and without direct managerial controls - and also the manufacturing of the equipment.</p>

              <p>And the planes will crash, just like the recent crash of Hawk aircraft. Substandard parts were used and sold. Import is costly. Subject to sanctions, restrictions, inferior products etc. There is no way out other than indigenisation for India.</p>

              Estimated 700,000 Indian Army personnel deployed in mountainous Kashmir
              and they did not have high altitude clothing.</p>
              <p>Indian Army leadership has taken up complaining about anything and
              anything around it when it comes to indigenisation of critical arms and
              equipment. These equipment happens to be high value and puts
              considerable strain on foreign exchange. This equipments also represent
              lucrative arms market where abnormal influences exist.</p>
              <p>The successive weak governments which came after the death of Indira
              Gandhi, till the dynamic leadership of PV Narasimha Rao, had neglected
              the Indian Defence forces and it has taken the toll on the equipment
              needs of Armed forces in general. The Cinderella sister, the Indian <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://frontierindia.net/an-army-under-siege#"><span style="color: #ee1c24;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #ee1c24 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 10.6667px; position: static;">Navy</span></span></a> (IN), the best of the what Indian Armed forces has, took this
              opportunity to develop Indian designs and build Indian warship with as
              much indigenous content possible. Then came the Soviet Union collapse
              and we saw IN scrambling to build indigenous and ingenious capacities
              to keep their Soviet ship content afloat. In fact the IN design house
              was so ambitious that it wanted to build an aircraft carrier, but, not
              backed up by the weak governments.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, the IA made a mess of the indigenous projects.
              Indian Army has a huge engineering manpower which did no innovation and
              behave like glorified mechanics. Today, when IN flaunts its homegrown
              ships, IA likes to parade its imported weaponry to the world around.</p>
              <p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>
              <p>There is no point flogging the dead horse, but, its very necessary
              to understand what is happening now. Things have not improved yet with
              the army. It still looks around for imported means. The army has made a
              mess of itself when it comes to indigenous equipment. Take the case of
              Arjun Tank. The Army is the one which has issued its specs, then
              changed it often when it comes near deployment, then tested it till it
              develops mistakes. The Arjun Tank has exceeded its performance,but, the
              Army has not improved its act. Last we heard is that there was a
              possibility of sabotage during he Ary’s internal trials. Since then the
              Ministry of Defence has made the Director General Mechanised Forces
              responsible for overseeing the induction.</p>
              <p>Another example is Akash and Trishul projects. It is often cited
              that even the Navy has rejected Trishul SAM. This is an invalid
              criticism; the naval version of the Trishul SAM is totally different
              from the Army and the Air force version. Akash has been demonstrated to
              perfection to the Indian Air Force (IAF), Trishul has been in limited
              induction by IAF for familiarisation. But, Army refuses to buy it. Here
              too the Ministry of Defence has taken a decision to keep the medium
              range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) with Israel on hold, trying to
              force the Army to accept the Akash Missile at least.</p>
              <p>Then the Eurocopter helicopter deal where the Army was testing a
              model which it was not going to get. Fortunately the Hindustan
              Aeronautics Limited stepped in a proved that upgraded Cheetas and
              Chetaks do a much better job than the imported option. This also brings
              in the question mark on the Indian Army’s standards of testing.</p>
              <p>In the first place the Director General Mechanised Forces and
              Director General Military operations of the Indian Army are responsible
              for equipment decision. This is where the buck stops. The government
              should start seriously auditing these positions for understanding what
              went wrong with indigenisation programs and effects of the import
              lobby. Indian Army should create a new position called Director General
              for indigenisation of equipment, if it already dosen’t exist.</p>
              <p>It is normally end-user who must have the final say on the
              suitability of the equipment for the use, but, it is necessary to audit
              the end-user for their judgment. It has become very necessary to
              involve third party evaluators for the Army purchases considering the
              past examples.</p>

              <p><span id="test" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 18px;"> NEW DELHI: By 2010-2011, India hopes
              to gatecrash into a very exclusive club of countries, which have both ICBMs
              (intercontinental ballistic missiles) and SLBMs (submarine-launched ballistic
              missiles) as well as BMD (ballistic missile defence)
              capabilities.
              <br> <br> Only the US and Russia strictly qualify for this club
              as of now, if all the three capabilities — ICBM, SLBM and BMD — are
              taken together, with countries like China not too far behind.
              <br> <br> Top
              defence scientists, on the sidelines of the annual DRDO awards on Monday, told
              <span style="font-style: italic;"> TOI </span> they were quite confident India
              would have ICBMs and SLBMs, even though their strike ranges would be much lesser
              than American, Russian or Chinese missiles, as also a functional BMD system soon
              after the turn of this decade.
              <br> <br> DRDO, of course, often promises much
              more than it delivers. But this time, it's ready to walk its talk, emboldened by
              the successful test of the 3,500-km range Agni-III missile last
              week.
              <br> <br> Take ICBMs first. "We have already started the design work for
              Agni-V, with a range of over 5,000-km. It basically involves development of a
              third composite stage for the two-stage Agni-III," said Agni programme director
              Avinash Chander.
              <br> <br> "We will be ready to test Agni-V by 2010," he added.
              There will not be an Agni-IV missile, with DRDO leapfrogging from intermediate
              range Agni-III to the almost ICBM-like Agni-V. "We have the capability to go for
              even longer ranges but it's for the political leadership to take a decision on
              such matters," said Chander. </span></p>
              <p><br><span id="test" style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; line-height: 18px;"> As for the fledgling but
              "unique" two-tier BMD system, capable of tracking and destroying hostile
              missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere, it will be
              tested again in July.
              <br> <br> The BMD system has been tested two times till
              now. The first test was in November 2006 when an "exo-atmospheric" hypersonic
              interceptor missile successfully destroyed an incoming Prithvi missile at an
              altitude of around 40-50 km, demonstrating a capability akin to the Israeli
              Arrow-2 BMD system.
              <br> <br> The second time, in December 2007, an
              "endo-atmospheric" interceptor successfully took on the "enemy" missile at a
              15-km altitude, on the lines of the American Patriot Advanced Capability-3
              (PAC-3) system. "Around July, we will test the exo-interceptor again. This time,
              we will test it at an 80-km altitude against a longer range 'enemy' missile.
              Then, in September-October, we will test the exo and endo together," DRDO chief
              controller for missiles V K Saraswat told
              <span style="font-style: italic;"> TOI. </span> <br> <br> "BMD is very important
              since there are ballistic missiles all around us. If you are strong in your
              defence, an adversary will think twice before any misadventure," he added. The
              BMD system should be ready for deployment by 2011 or so, after several tests
              against a variety of missiles to ensure a kill probability of 99.8%, said
              Saraswat.
              <br> <br> The third capability in the shape of the K-15 SLBM, which
              has been tested only from submersible pontoon launchers so far, should also be
              ready by that time to be integrated into the indigenous nuclear-powered
              submarines being built under the secretive ATV (advanced technology vessel)
              programme.
              <br> <br> The initial range of K-15 will, however, be limited to
              750-km, far less than the over 5,000-km range SLBMs brandished by the 'Big-5'
              countries. Nevertheless, it will mark the completion of <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Going_ballistic_India_looks_to_join_elite_missile_club/articleshow/msid-3034062,curpg-2.cms#"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="color: blue ! important; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 12px; position: static;">India's</span></span></a> "nuclear triad",
              which so far is limited to the Agni missiles and fighters like Mirage-2000s
              jury-rigged to carry nuclear weapons.
              <br> <br> Indian defence planners have
              long bemoaned the absence of nuclear-powered submarines, armed with
              nuclear-tipped missiles, since they are considered the most reliable, survivable
              and deadly nuclear weapons
              platforms. </span></p>
