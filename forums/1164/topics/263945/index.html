            <div class='col-md body'>Forgive me but...dont the presence of visible enemy naval craft off-shore means all our PVs kenna sunk?!<br><br>Anyway, we should have close-range air support (i doubt it would be F-16s though)<br><br>Regarding Artillery - there are "smart" programmable rounds out there that attune the shell to detonate above the surface to create a sharpnel cone of death from above. Accuracy is well---as accurate as it possible on a sea without points of reference i suppose.....(Poor fishies kenna make into Otah paste also dont know why <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>I dont know whether we have Ashms but like mentioned, we have too many ships off shore to actually risk a mis fire.<br><br>Direct Anti-tank weapons like 84 RR 106 RR Law Milan?? Or TOW may play a part instead. HEAT rounds make not do much damage to a ship's hull but do i wont stick around if i get hit by one of those either.<br><br>Oh yeah dont forget HMGs and AGLs with air burst munitions to create a hell of a racket and HEDP to break some windows!  The longer a hostile craft is near our coast the more things and time we have to bring a party to it. So they will most likely be quite a distance off shore.  We can always equip our colibris with rocket pods and jump them.</div>

So they are indirect weapons, except for the lower caliber guns.<br><br>However, Naval Guns are expected to lob heavier shells for armour penetration which one does not need on land. Hence, they have to elevate their guns at the right angle to score a shot. An example would be the AP round the US used in WWII which weighed 1225 kg. Take a look at this: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun</a>. With shells this heavy, one must definitely account for the parabolic trajectory. I suspect these weapons have a reinforced frontal tip possibly similar to anti-tank projectiles back then. After all, battleship armor was simply lots and lots of steel.<br><br>The shore defence guns are of the same type as the naval guns as well.<br><br>Actually a 14" and above gun will be overkill. I mean, any destroyer now will sink probably even before the shell explodes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
