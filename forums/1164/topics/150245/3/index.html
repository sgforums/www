            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that the SM1 is obsolete but i beg to defer on Tempest. I have personally encountered it during my NSF days. It have been very heavily upgraded from the original Centurion MBT. This can clearly be seen from its exterior. I have also gotten info from a Reservist who is part of the unit using Tempest that the FCS is also upgraded. There are many things which i cannot say here but i assure you that Tempest is still a force to be reckon with despite its apparent old age. The Tempest is in a way similar to the Challenger submarines which we got. The hulls themselves are indeed old but the secret is what exist within those hulls. There is word that the equipment within the hull is almost totally replaced by new ones. They have been proven to be effective as can be seen in the recent excercise with the US carrier.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
