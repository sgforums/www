            <div class='col-md body'>No, still waiting for Mindef to finally enlist me.  Those bastards like don't want me liddat.  I call them up 5-6 times liao, went down cmpb 4 times... tell them to enlist me faster... they still take their own sweet time.  Those people at enlistment office, are they working or not?  *@!&amp;#*(@!<br><br>Anycase, that was a very impressive "show of force,"  to the Malaysian government.  If they still don't get the message, next thing we'll do is have a massive air, land n sea exercise to really print out "WE MEAN BUSINESS" to them.  Unfortunately, we may not have enough space for that.  We'll probably start flying and shipping our overseas based equipment and personnel back to Singapore, just to strengthen our defensive deterrence posture.  I believe this open mobilisation was planned after the infamous statement, "If Singapore does not wish to compromise, then go to war."  Instead of replying to them directly like, "we are ready to go to war..." and causing possible public uproar, and regional panic for no reason other than the childish antic of one neighbour. The government wisely chose this solution to indirectly reply, "we are ready for it, anytime you want..."  Looks like, the military is really a tool of the state after all.<br><br>Oh ya, Armor infantry don't always get to ride around in the bionix or any other IFV.  More than often, they run behind it or alongside it.  Lucky?  No... hot exhaust from a fighting vehicle can be annoying.<br><br></div>
