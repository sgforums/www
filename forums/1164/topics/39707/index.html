            <div class='col-md body'>Eurofighter Typhoon Lightning Strike Success  20 June 2003<br><br>(Hallbergmoos -  10 June, 2003) Eurofighter GmbH announced the successful completion of a range of Lightning Strike Tests on the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System required as part of the Type Acceptance clearance ahead of Entry in to Service with the four partner nations Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The tests, carried out at BAE SYSTEMS Warton, were performed on a Series Production Aircraft (SPA) Â– BT002.<br><br>Eurofighter Typhoon successfully withstood a number of 200,000 Amp simulated lightning strikes during tests in the BAE SYSTEMS Electronic Warfare Test Facility at Warton, United Kingdom. This is the highest strike the Weapon Systems specification requires and also meets the necessary requirement for Type Acceptance.<br><br>The testing, using a series production standard aircraft, is required to ensure that all systems on the aircraft remain operational in the event of the aircraft being struck by lightning.<br><br>Over the test programme, the aircraft ran Â‘liveÂ’ with all necessary systems switched on. During the test the aircraft received hundreds of strikes of between 20k and 150k Amps before reaching the specified 200k Amp strike.<br><br>All testing to date has been conducted with the simulated strike entering at the nose and exiting at the engines or wing-tips - two of the most likely scenarios. The next stage is to computer model a further 23 entry/exit point scenarios to ensure system integrity is maintained in all possible combinations of entry and exit.<br><br>Tony Llewellyn, Electro-Magnetic Compatibility Technologist at BAE SYSTEMS said: Â“The Eurofighter Typhoon places a greater reliance on electronics and with a large percentage of the aircraft being carbon fibre, which is electrically resistive, it is much more difficult to protect the aircraft compared with its predecessors, which have a metal structure.Â”<br><br>Chris Jones, Lightning Technologist at BAE SYSTEMS added Â“We believe that this is the first time ever in a clearance programme that an aircraft with all systems powered has been subjected to a 200k Amp simulated lightning strike and it is a great achievement for everyone involved that no critical systems effects resulted.Â”<br><br>Â“The 200k Amp limit covers more than 99.9% of all lightning strikes to aircraft flying anywhere in the world, and on average a military aircraft gets struck by lightning twice in its entire life, so the chances of an aircraft ever being hit by a 200k Amp bolt are small. BT002 will have received 1,600 strikes by the time testing is complete, and we have successfully proved that Eurofighter Typhoon is more than capable of withstanding such a strike.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eurofighter Typhoon Mass Matters  10 June 2003<br><br>Hallbergmoos Â– 10 June 2003) In preparation for Type Acceptance and the start of delivery of the first production aircraft to the Eurofighter Partner Nations, Eurofighter Typhoon has passed a significant milestone by achieving its contracted mass requirement. Achieving aircraft mass requirements is fundamental in the design and production of the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System and any air system.<br><br>This important engineering benchmark will allow the partner air forces to maximise the performance and carriage capability of the weapon system. At the same time it will contribute to providing a robust product capable of significant growth to adopt the future capability requirements of the Partner Air Forces.<br><br>The first four production standard Eurofighter Typhoon SPAÂ’s (two seat variants) have now been weighed in preparation for hand over to the four Air Forces. The results show that all four production aircraft have measured values below the contracted aircraft mass requirements.<br><br>The contracted Basic Mass Empty (BME) for the single seat aircraft is 11 tonnes with the two seat aircraft 700 kg heavier. Based on these weighings Eurofighter is confident that all Tranche 1 aircraft will be within the contracted mass requirements.<br><br>From the outset the mass of the aircraft was seen as a very critical issue and one that could make the difference between success or failure of the project. For this reason Eurofighter was given overall responsibility to manage the total aircraft mass control. As the weapon system evolved through development and into production we have seen many challenges which have tested the skills of all concerned.<br><br>Commenting on events Filippo Bagnato, CEO Eurofighter GmbH, stated Â‘This is, perhaps, the first time in aviation history that a military aircraft has been developed within such strict mass control limits. The results we are witnessing today are a testament to the engineering discipline applied by all of the Eurofighter<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eurofighter Signs Key Support Contract  17 July 2003<br><br>Eurofighter GmbH announces the signature of a contract that covers in service support services for an Initial Operational Phase. The contract, designated PC11, is valued at more than Euro 120 million in this first phase. The Eurofighter Typhoon support concept is based on a close collaboration between industry and partner air forces. It sets out to provide a unique and highly responsive support network that will significantly reduce the cost of ownership of the weapon system. The provision of ILS support services through PC11 is another example of this partnership at work.<br><br>The PC11 contract defines a range of activities and services to be provided by Eurofighter to support the operation of the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System during the in-service Operational Phase 1A (Learning Phase). The contract also includes a description of activities which need to be carried out to prepare for future Operational Phases.<br><br>The work covered by this contract is an integral part of the CustomerÂ’s requirements for Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) for the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System.<br><br>In-Service Support Services<br>Design Authority Services (DAS) - The management and preparation of modifications under discrete task conditions, engineering tasks and sustaining activities. This work must be undertaken by the Design Authorities (DA) in order to maintain the airworthiness, safety, integrity and configuration control of the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System.<br><br>Technical Logistics Services (TLS) - These services provide technical assistance to the Partner Air Forces for their chosen operational and maintenance concepts. Although DA knowledge is desirable to undertake these services, it is not essential.<br><br>Supply Logistics Services (SLS) - These services embrace the authorised management and execution of provisioning, procurement and progression of support items (including spares) to guarantee the operational capabilities of the Weapon System not already covered by existing contracts.<br><br>Integrated Logistics Support Services (ILSS) Â– Provide analysis of the support implications resulting from changes beyond the Full Operation Capability (FOC) standard of the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System. This includes related items of Support Equipment, review of support arrangements in the light of in-service experience and development of plans to deliver consistent and compatible support items.<br><br>PC 11 is a key contract to support entry in to service for the Eurofighter Typhoon Weapon System. Currently the International Weapons Support System Â– the overarching support infrastructure for Eurofighter Typhoon, is being established across the partner nations linked by a co-ordination Centre (IWSSC) at Eurofighter in Germany. At the same time National Support Centres have begun the task of preparing for the arrival of the first Series Production Aircraft following the signature of Type Acceptance on 30 June, 2003.<br><br></div>

The only ones who use the boom and receptacle is the US Air Force, because of it's higher fuel transfer rate, needed for large aircraft like SR-71, B-52, B-1 and B-2 etc so the USAF adopted the method fleet-wide. Foreign users only use this method because they buy aircraft the USAF uses (eg non-US F-16 users), and its not economical/possible to change the bird to the probe method unless they have lots of a type to justify modifying their aircraft (eg Israel and the F-4E).<br><br>Now the downside to the boom and receptacle method is at separation quite a bit of fuel is wasted.<br><br>And no, the question is not stupid   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
