I have shot it and don;t mind having one !

Over in US!  a lot of people like the heavier and slower bullet like the .45ACP! big 230 grain of lead .... than there is the other with lightweight bullet with higher velocity with hi Kinietic energy!<br><br>Pistol cartridge will always be pistol cartridge and its knock down power is always limited.... things like the .44 and .50AE or the 454 CAsull all have one purpose ! knock down power ... its penetration in terms of amor pierecing is defeintly questionable! ( mainly in the bullet design and all) and the accuracy at ranges cannot be comparable to rifle cartridge.  I guess reason non of this big cartridge isbeing design as a SMG!<br><br>If you want to make a SMG in these big ... recoil burden cartridge why not go with an assualt rifle... does the same job! has less recoil and can shoot further and more accurate!<br><br>Also proven is that say the 5.56 or FN 5.7mm that utilized hi KE, has less collateral damage!  in most US homes that uses dry wall has wall partition! the 5.56 and 5.7 will not penetrate those! but will penetrate a type 3 level body armor at 100 meter ! reason is the hi KE and bullet design that when a high velocity 5.56touches a dry wall it fragment !! but a harder object like Body armor it actually punches thru like a AP round ! ( SS109) ... whereelse the 9mm MP5 will overpenetrate in the same environement with 9mm ammo!<br><br>I guess all cartridge is made to have its purpose and place....<br><br>DAveC</div>

The bottle neck can produce much higher pressure  becasue of the neck.. thus a same size cartidge of straight wall and bottleneck... the later can produce much higher pressure thus much higher velocity and thus more power.<br><br>from a reloading stand point, straight wall is much easier to reload becasue you don;t need to lube the empty brass and also don;t need to trim the case... alot of time the brass actually elongate due to high pressure necked cartridge.<br><br>don;t forget about 357 SIG ammo !  its a .40 caliber necked down to .355 neck or 9mm .... very high pressure round ! but a pain in a butt to reload the 357SIG.<br><br>I guess thats the reason we get most rifle cartrdige to be necked!<br><br>DaveC</div>

The case doesn't need to be lubricated if you first resize it in a carbide 40 S&amp;W die, then resize it again in a regular steel 357 Sig die. The second step essentially performs just a neck resize on the 357 Sig case, thus eliminating the lubrication requirement.<br><br>I've found the 357 Sig cartridge to be an exceptionally accurate and consistent round, particularly in mid-power loadings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The case doesn't need to be lubricated if you first resize it in a carbide 40 S&amp;W die, then resize it again in a regular steel 357 Sig die.

The carbide 40 S&amp;W die resizes the body, and the steel 357 Sig die resizes the neck, without need for lubrication. Works like a charm!<br><br>The secret to getting the projectile to seat correctly is to <strong>not</strong> flare the case mouth. Just use a chamfer tool to deburr the case mouth and give the inside lip a bit of a bevel, and the projectile will seat perfectly each and every time.<br><br>What kind of projectile were you using for your 357 Sig reloads? The neck of a 357 Sig case doesn't adequately grip the ogive of a round-nosed 9mm projectile. You need to use a 9mm projectile with an adequate length of straight wall for the neck to grip securely.<br><br>My standard 357 Sig recipe calls for a Rainier 124 gr. 9mm <strong>flat-point</strong> projectile seated atop 5.6 gr. of Universal powder at an overall case length of 1.145", with a light taper crimp applied at the mouth. This recipe clocks approximately 1180 fps out of the 3.9" barrel of my Sig Pro SP2340. This is a reasonably soft-shooting recipe that is phenomenally accurate and consistent, and doesn't stress the brass much (i.e., the spent primers in the fired cases still have rounded edges).</div>

And yes, there are courses you can take as a civilian. A Tactical Pistol I class is usually one day and Tac Pistol II is another.

That said, we've imported firearms so ammo shouldn't be an issue.<br><br>Right now I have no idea what the word is on the PRC but if you have something in mind, feel free to contact me.</div>
