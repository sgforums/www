But a good feature is that they allow you to quickly assess how many rounds you have left in a gunfight rather then wait for that "Almighty Death-Click". Not too sure about the costs involved per unit though.</div>

I wouldn't say the 7.62 x 39mm cartridge is <span style="font-style: italic;">inherently</span> inaccurate. Perhaps its close association with the venerable AK-47, which sacrifices accuracy to gain reliability, is responsible for that perception.<br><br>(I have a friend who has an accurized and scoped Yugoslavian SKS rifle that's chambered in that caliber, and it regularly shoots sub-2" groups at 100 yards with regular commercial Wolf-brand ammo.

Well! 7.62x39mm can be made to be quite accurate ( I guess accurate is a relative word!  1/4 MOA or 3 MOA!??))  So! just for illustration sake! We use good quality 7.62x39mm by Lapua! and shoot it thru a SAKO Valmet! it did about 1.5" at 100 yds ! I think that is pretty good ..<br><br>DaveC!</div>

Are there more reliable versions of STANAG mags out there? What other materials are used instead of aluminium?<br><br>What do they cost compared to a standard M16 mag?<br><br>Are there any STANAG mags that allow you to see the number of rounds you have?<br><br>I know that Diemaco make their own mags for their own versions of the M16 which can be swapped with normal M16 mags.<br><br>The Brits and Israelis also make their own (STANAG?) mags for their own weapons like the L85 and the Galil. Are these interchangeable with M16?<br></div></blockquote>HI MOca!<br><br>AS for the British STANAG! they did make a steel body and also AL body mags for the L85A1!  but they are poorly made and I can attest to that! it sucks! .... and than HK came in and re-vamp the L85 to the L85A2 and one of them is the intriduction of the HK mags!  this one is very well made , steel also with steel non tilt follower and even the angle of the mags is change ! but expensive!<br><br>The Isreali went with a polymer based M16 mags! and they are call Orlite ! as for the Galil mags !no it will not fit the M16 ! but the Galil does have a M16 mag adapter to use the M16 magazine!<br><br>The M16 STanag mag has its problem ! There are a lot of improvement like Magpul new polymer base mags which is super strong and super reilable! ... akso we can improve upon our old mags by changing out the non tilt follower from Magpul!<br><br>DaveC</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DaveC hit the nail right on the head with his explanation of the benefits of handloading! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Aside from being able to completely customize a cartridge to an individual firearm to maximize its accuracy, there's also the immense satisfaction gained from the process of experimentation in the work-up to the "perfect" handload, and the pride of knowing that you're shooting products of your own handiwork rather than generic store-bought ammunition.<br><br>Then there's the cost aspect to handloading: it costs significantly less to handload than to buy commercial ammunition, especially in the larger calibers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gents,<br><br>As indicated above, folks reload for several main reasons:<br><br>1) To save money, especially if you shoot as much as some of us do, about 20K to 25K a year on average.<br><br>2) To get the perfect load needed for say, competition. Take the venerable 45ACP for example. Factory loads are high power factors. If you shoot (say) IDPA, the factory load is about 195 but IDPA only requires you to meet 165. That is a huge difference and when you download it to 165, the 1911 shoots very nice and soft.<br><br>3) 'Cos the damn ammo is not easily available. Getting harder these days to find large qty of 5.56mm ball. We normally buy several thousand rounds at a time and we cannot seem to find Federal Eagle's 5.56mm in stock these days. Everything points to the so-called 'war effort'.<br><br>Now, not all factory ammo is expensive and holds a high power factor. For most of our guys who compete in 9mm, if we're buying in bulk, it is almost always cheaper for us to purchase as a group. The cost is about the same as reloading. That said, we do not buy brand new ammo but reloaded ones from a reputable company that supplies to the US Army Marksmanship Team.</div>
