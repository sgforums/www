            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0105/m18a1b.jpg"><img src="http://www.diddybop.demon.co.uk/claybk.jpg">View of the open rear of a Claymore mine.<br><br>Primary function: Anti-personnel, defensive.<br>Weight: 3.53 lbs.<br>Maximum effective range: 328 ft.<br><br>The design for the Claymore mine was originally conceived by the German Army during WW2. The original mine consisted of a solid slab of explosive with a hollowed front face. The concave surface of the mine was lined with a solid brick of steel and was originally intended as an anti tank mine. When detonated the explosive force was enough to throw the steel brick forward with enough power and velocity to penetrate a tank's armour plating at ranges up to 50 meters. However the Germans never fully perfected the weapon. Instead it was left to the US Army to expand on the idea in response to the massed North Korean, and Chinese attacks that US soldiers faced during the Korean war. US ordnance experts developed the idea of a mine that would propel hundreds of small pieces of steel in one - go thereby causing maximum casualties among the enemy. However trials of this experimental mine were not completed before the Korean war ended.<br><br>By the time of the Vietnam war 65-75 the mine had been fully developed, with the version used in Vietnam being the M-18A1.The mine had an olive-drab coloured outer casing with the words "Front Toward Enemy" embossed on it and was made from plastic which measured 216mm long, by 83mm high, and was 35mm deep. Inside the casing was 0.68Kg of C-4 plastic explosive in front of which was placed 700 steel ball bearings. Designed so the convex side faced the enemy, and steadied by digging a twin set of "V" shaped legs into the earth. When detonated the blast sprayed its contents in a 60 degree fan-shaped arc that was lethal up to 50 meters. The mine could be either command detonated by using the hand held "clacker" (or a PRC 25 battery) which sent an electrical charge through the wire to the blasting cap inserted in the mine. Or detonated by trip wire.<br><br>When arranged in fixed defensive positions Claymore's were arranged so as to have overlapping kill zones. It was also a very effective tool for initiating ambushes due to the instant devastating, and lethal zone generated. And also because it did not reveal the whereabouts of the ambush team.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the primary role for the 2 plugs on top is to have a secondary method of detonation in case the primary failed.<br><br>i guess you MAY daisy chained the claymores together using that, but i think that's not recommended coz' chances of the rest being blinds are very very high after the 1st in the chain detonates<br><br>same concept when u setup a primary demolition circuit, you can't overlap det cords and no more than 90degress  turns in the circuit.<br><br>if you wanna fire all the claymores using 1 activation, then a simple demolition circuit like positive or simple junction box will do the trick. for kiasus, double positive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Yes of course the yanks developed the MOAB for afganistan but there are much much smaller versions.<br><br>There is schmel tube launch version the blast according to experts resembles 122mm arti blast.<br><br>The chinese CCP bought 10,000 of those tubes and right to manufacture under license.<br><br>The Sri lankans bought 1000 tubes to tame their tigers.<br><br>The malaysians may have it in the form of ammo for their not so long ago purchased metis-m launchers<br><br>But then recently the russians developed an even smaller thermobaric version for grenade launched weapons the size is like an M203 round<br><br>thermobaric grenade launch "One round away" kao tim sai - exercise cut.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>claymore you still have to lay charge, lay the cable a certain distance for safety , worry back blast, worry sweaty palms, worry kanna shot in the ass by hidden snipers .... <strong>hoi exercise cut liao lah!!!!</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
