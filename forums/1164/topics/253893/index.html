            <div class='col-md body'>FInally got me the SIG-556 rifle.  its a derivative of the SIG-551 series but takes M16 Stanag mags , an M4 type retractable buttstock. I mount an ACOG- TA-01 NSN on it.. the fit and finish is quite good, not as good as the SIG550 series. trigger is smooth like butter.. CAn;t belief a production rifle can have such crisp trigger ! thanks to teh Swiss Engineering.  RIfle is in 1:7 twist so it will stabalize the SS109 or M855 62 grain 5.56 ammo and not as well on the 55 grain M193 bullet. BArrel is 16".. rifle feels a little front heavy and with the ACOG it is more balance now.  magazine release button is a little far.. compared to the M4.  Handguard is Ballistic polymer with PIcatinny rails for your NINJA stuff!<br><br>Will sight in and shoot it this weekend to see how it does.<br><br>A lot of comments saying the SIG 556 looks like M4 or AR15  and looks ugly!... but I feel this is  better design to the SIG551 series becasue the folding stock is way too long and you cannot adjust to your shooting preference like with body armor and SBO where you need to shorten the length of the stock.. M16 mag is another good thing than to stock up another magazine type.  So! I do prefer the sleek design of the SIG551 series but do like the 556 for its funtionality! I still get the quality of SIG and reliability and yet a lot of familiar AR trades is in it! SO! I trade the good looks of the SIG551 for funtionality of the 556!<br><br>DaveC!<br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/P1010011.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y66/davechng/Guns/P1010006.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>HI Moca<br><br>The rifle set me back $1249. not bad price for a SIG rifle. , good choice of weapons that you like... In fact I like those that you mentioned, the SIG 550, M4 series for the 5.56 rifle... for 7.62 I also liked the Inch pattern FAL ... Have 2 of those L1A1 in my pocession! great rifle.<br><br>Enfields!  YEs !my favourite WW2 bolt action rifle ! I try to collect them, have  a couple of SMLE No1. Mk3, NO.4, NO.5, No 4T, L39... still looking for the L42 and No.1 Mk5.... ENfields are great except for the avialaiblilty of good ammo .... I reload now for the 303 ammo so its okay now!  We use to be able to get brand new in the wrapper NO.4 Mk2 for $150!  gone were those days!<br><br>Shotguns are great little thing  ! recenelty got me hook on a Russina Saiga 12... magazine fed and semi auto! have a MOssberg 590 pump! also some Over under 12 gauge  .... THEY ARE  fun to ahve! but using the wrong load and kick the hell out of you!  Still my favourite shot gun is the Benelli M1!<br><br>DaveC<br><br>DaveC!</div>
