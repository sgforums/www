            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys, I'm actually writing a paper related to this matter. But lots of you are missing one point and i can't fault u since it IS a military forum. National service can cover the 5 aspects of Total Defence. Why not make compulsory service for women and have them cover the other aspects? National service, which most of you might agree with me, helps to foster friendship and weaves and binds the interracial fabric of our country. Even though it isn't in a very apparent manner, there are certainly benefits of National Service.<br><br>Does anybody know what the government's OFFICIAL stand on women and National service is?<br><br>and nobody seems to have the answer to my 2nd question..

            <div class='col-md body'>NS is already unpopular with about half of Singapores population. If there is NS for women, the whole of Singapore would be unhappy!<br><br>On issue of equality, IMO, women should do it too. Not neccessarily in military but nursing, teaching assistants etc, areas where Singapore needs contribution in. Not because these are less tough areas but because SOP for men in the military already established and there is little point in totally revamping it to include women.<br><br>Women not included in NS at all, IMO, is because Singapore is a conservative (some say MCP) society and basically there is enough guys to go around to do the job in theory.<br><br>However, the interesting thing to consider is that if women are roped into the military, because there is a surge in number of potential troops. can NS be shortened to 1 year?</div>

Why not make compulsory service for women and have them cover the other aspects? National service, which most of you might agree with me, helps to foster friendship and weaves and binds the interracial fabric of our country. Even though it isn't in a very apparent manner, there are certainly benefits of National Service.<br><br>Does anybody know what the government's OFFICIAL stand on women and National service is?<br><br>and nobody seems to have the answer to my 2nd question.. When did women enter the SAF, SPF and the SCDF?</div></blockquote>F.B, maybe you should get your research done through an OFFICIAL government spokesperson.  When one talks of National Service, most can't help but relate it to the military as its the ultimate sacrifice anyone can contribute to his or her nation.  As you can compare it with other countries that have National Service for women, its usually in the military.  And Israel would be an example for females having to serve as conscripts or National Service.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>As for the other 5 aspects of Total Defence( whatever it maybe ), canyone can do it without having to put it as a National Service.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Lastly, on your 2nd question, you really should refer it to an OFFICIAL government spokesperson.  Otherwise, you'll just be getting guesses. Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

However, if you were a parent, or worst a single parent, of a daughter.
