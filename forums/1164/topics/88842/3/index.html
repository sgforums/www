Thus nothing classified has been disclosed.<br><br>As for airborne armoured asset, this is not something that has not be done in other army, for example the Sheridan and recently 82nd felt that they need more armour &amp; firepower for their operation since the retirement of Sheridan thus requested to have the number of old prototype M8 inducted into their units becos they have a real operational need for them. Those who are familiar with M8 should know abt it.<br><br>In this case , I am not suggesting a surprise covert commando strike operation  to use a AFV .<br><br>But what I am suggesting a AFV to support Heli borne RDF,  I once said what if the amphi AMX-10s are not available for them during operation, the best way is to either Heli borne or airborne deployable AFVs to support them.<br><br>A heli borne deployable type AFV will be very light weight = very little armour thus low in survivability. LSV might even be better.<br><br>A airborne deployable type AFV will be heavier thus more armour for survivability and also better firpower.<br><br>As for arguing a case, I was just suggesting possibilities.<br>In fact it is just a natural evolution for RDF or other any units, more capability will be inducted into it as time go by, as technology improve as well as the need to expand capability.<br><br>Eg. 7 SIR into 1st Guard.... till today RDF with all the heli borne asset, it is really unthinkable for a future airborne armour asset ???<br><br>Especially our neighbour are getting more armour asset!!!</div>
