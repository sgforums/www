            <div class='col-md body'>For those who claim that SAF/ Mindef do not answer to the Parliment, give yourself clap on the back.  Its true, SAF/ Mindef doesn't have to but the defence budget is still presented to the house during CLOSE DOOR sections. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>As for the answering to our "friendly" neighbours, when SAF purchsed the attack-helicopter with long bow gear, our "friendly" neighbours made a big hooha over the issue saying S'pore was being aggressive &amp; even send a diplomatic letter to request an explaination from S'pore.  Of course, it was settle with diplomatic respond that the attack-helicopters would not be station in S'pore during peace-time, pre-911.<br><br>So, its not that S'pore has to but rather it will. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>True, many things related to the army is not reveal to the public, so how many want to reveal it here?  Be very careful, we are just gossiping here, so don't take my words to seriously.  Whether or not I'm S'porean, doesn't matter does it?  S'pore is multi-culture, multi-raced, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>As for some1 mentioning that 21RDD is already active, personally I don't care, but in case you might be mistaken, could it be the ADF or the combine arms formation?  Then again, best not to mention it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The truth maybe out there but its sure as hell not safe to talk about it.

One C-130 could carry abt 2 -3 such vehicles, and Chinnok only one and also lighter AFV which is less protected.<br><br>The whole operation is not limited to only C-130, 12 Chinook for lighter asset like the LSV, LG105mm etc, whereas the 8-10 C-130 will have abt at least 16 heavier AFVs.<br><br>The combined airlift capacity will be greatly increased when both type are used right?</div>
