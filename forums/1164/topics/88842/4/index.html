Heli-ops offer the advantage of mobility - now I'm here, the next moment I'm somewhere else. Not forgetting the use of attack helicoptors as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On a completely unrelated note to the mud-slinging above... I am moved to turn your attention to the b/m post<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Lets be realistic, ADF by whatever name we interprate it is not its actual name due to the fact that they can be disbanded if MINDEF decide that they are no longer needed as their main duties are to support the United Nation missions.  Thats why their contract is much different from other regulars. </div></blockquote>That is incorrect. The ADF Bn continues to answer to that nomenclature. Their main duties are not to support UN Missions. And if you looked hard enough, you will also find that the soldiers' pay is same as every other regular in SAF. Just that they receive allowances in their UN tours, allowances which every other sevicemen (none-ADF) also happened to receive in said tours.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Joshua1975:<br>An outfit in itself? Maybe but they are somehow under ATEC now.<br><br>Career no good? 'They' somehow feel this is one thing on the guys mind and I think they had made some changes and for sure the tour is not recognised but just take into consideration.<br><br>Guys in ADF and later move back to unit will find it hard to adapt the unit SOP somehow as they have get used to the 'moves' in ADF. I met a few during my course last year and some had just come back from oversea, and they keep saying behind the instructors back, where got like that one, sure die lar...  talking about tactics and moves<br>[/b]</blockquote>That is completely off the mark. They exist as an independent Bn, but logistically and administratively are supported by an active Bde. ATEC constantly suffers from a shortage of manpower, especially whenever each batch of aggressor ORDs.  So ADF tags along 1. to conduct their own exercises overseas 2. to keep their sharpness in the field.<br><br>The troopers in ADF do get promotions.<br><br>Finally, the idea that ADF exists solely to experiment is quite ridiculous, when you remember that their troopers are the only ones in Sg to have done any form of Ops. In fact, I go as far as to say the tactics soldiers practise in NSF units, ie. inf Bns, guards Bns, and even Cdo Bn are very tailored to rack up good ATEC scores. The training cadre in ADF has no such concerns as ADF does not go through ATEC evaluation, so ADF can do away with all the 'wayang'. The considerations in their preparation are only operational in nature, not some dodgy system where you are  killed by some Umpires' randomly pointing finger.</div>
