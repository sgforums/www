            <div class='col-md body'>In one weekend in 1967, two occurrences at opposite ends of the world began the process whereby Americans convinced themselves that the Vietnam War was not worth fighting.<br><br>One of these was the ambush of an American battalion by the Vietcong, resulting in 61 casualties. The other was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where state police ejected students who were campaigning against the presence presence on campus of recruiting agents for napalm manufacturers Dow Chemical.<br><br>I just finished watching this BBC documentary. Very intense, almost emotional documentary.<br><br>Survivors of the ambush talked about that day, about how they were ambushed, about how their Bat. Cmdr tactically screwed up, how he'd never led a command section on the ground b4 (he previously did it from a Bell Sioux Helo). Lt Welch CO of Delta company, gives a particularly insightful and emotional account of the day, especially when he talks about how he woke up on the operating table after the battle (having been shot in the chest, right leg and both arms) and asking the doctor "what happend to his delta" and being told delta is gone(at this point he breaks down a bit in the interview)<br><br>As for the Wisconsin Uni demonstration, the police waded in and started beating peaceful students. And that in effect politicized students who previously had no stand either way about the war in vietnam. People interviewed included professors and assistant deans and students who were both involved or uninvolved with the demonstration, who recall with fury how the police, how the authorities betrayed the very values of democracy and free speech by taking action against anyone who opposed their position.<br><br>Very profound especially, is the way the war vets talk about how "nobody gives their lives up for their countries. Their lives get torn away from them by their countries" and how "it was a high price to pay for a needless cause".<br><br>The documentary also talks about the cover-up or positive spin the American media put on both events, by claiming there was a planned battle instead of an ambush, and by claiming the students were vicious and outnumbered police, forcing police to "fight for their lives"<br><br>I think Singaporeans can learn something about what true democracy is, what false fallacies democracy can turn into, and the price we can end up paying for lost causes.<br><br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/vietnam.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/vietnam.shtml</a></div>
