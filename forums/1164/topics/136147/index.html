According to the Hong Kong Da Gong Bao reported that, the strong wind two E cruise missile only takes along carries the conventional warhead, namely the high explosive or 子母 disperses scattering, is not nuclear  WMD.

            <div class='col-md body'>C how u define it, If u refer to the tomahawk style cruise missile, I think Taiwan doesnÂ’t have it yet, the only country in Asia masters the LACM is China, the Chinese DH-10 LACM reported by JaneÂ’s last sept has a minimum range of 1500km and CEP 10 meter, for tomahawk no need say more. But generally speaking, many Anti-ship missiles are considered Cruise missile as well. The HF2E is just an extended range ASM. RSNÂ’s Harpoon also is considered cruise missile if by this kind of  definition .</div>

For the first time, Taiwan will be able to attack targets as far away as Shanghai.<br><br>On 05 June 2005 it was repoted that Taiwan had successfully test fired its first long range cruise missile. The exact date of the test was unclear, though there was speculation that it may have been in March 2005.

            <div class='col-md body'>HF2E 1000km?  Not likely, the Taiwan media like the Chinatimes daily already denied this over-estimated range. Saying itÂ’s just several hundreds kms<br><br>Also, to achieve 1000km such range, the simple inertial navigation system with GPS midcourse guidance is not sufficient to guide that far( to achieve a decent CEP), still need terrain-contour matching (TERCOM) to assistant the missile on course midway. TERCOM requests digital mapping of the routine that the missile will follow, and then Taiwan possible has to launch Satellite-borne Radars to duly mapping every km of the terrain the missile will fly by and update regularly.
