            <div class='col-md body'>The modified Bionix ( it has a lower signature hull) was to be armed with a 105mm gun turret. But with the availability of the UD upgun turret ( A M8 deriative ) as well as after the evaluation of the CV90s120 tank and Sabra, decision was made to  change to 120mm guns. The Light Tank ( about 25tons ) will have 3man crew with add-on reactive armour and it was build to meet our new mechanised division requirement.This tank will have some tank hunting capacity ( it is too lightly protected ), which is not it's primary objective.</div>

This was mentioned years back in the Straits Times, Finance section, after the launch of the Bionix. The light tank, like the Primus will use the same automotive components. (Does the Bionix use the same\similar components as the M8???)<br><br>The Primus chassis can be used to develop in mobile SAM, in my view.<br><br></div></blockquote>The term 'light tank' is insideously misleading to the ill-informed of the reality of the capability of a 'light tank'.  The correct term to use is 'tank destroyer'<br><br>Properly defined, 'tank destroyer' is described, in essence,  as an anti-tank weapon, usually gun-based, mounted on a mobile platform.  The weapon may or may not be under armour, e.g. M-50 Ontos (6-barreled 106mm recoiless weapon system on air-droppable tracked chassis - 1950s-era).  Even if under armour, the weapon may or may not be traversable/turreted, e.g. Jagdpather, Marder (German tank destroyers - WW2 era).<br><br>Tank destroyers are solely designed to defeat enemy armour (up to MBT-class) but yet are not as protected nor as sophisticated as the MBTs.  In this perspective, all 'light tanks' are in fact tank destroyers simply because they will never be able to survive a direct hit from enemy tanks.<br><br>So I say this for the ppl who may be awed by the armour that we have or may be intending to acquire - the AMX13SM1, M8 AGS or any other 'light tank' that may be indigeously conceived - <strong>do not get too excited</strong>.  Armour will always have to bear the heavy burden of having their new 'light tanks' decimated in the face of heavy armour on the opposing side.<br><br>The only plausible argument by them would be the informed application of proven tactics of maneuver-on-contact by armies which had been out-numbered, out-gunned and under-armoured, like the IDF during the 1967 &amp; 1973 wars.<br><br></div>

That is true.<br><br>But the idea is, are we getting enough protection that we SHOULD be getting? Can our SM1 tanks repel LAWS? RPGs and other battlefield threats that with out weight considerations, modern technology can now protect against?<br><br>Can our current SM1 carry a gun that is capable of defeating MBTs? Which current technology can now provide a light tank?<br><br>Can our SM1 shoot on the move? Which long has been possible for light tanks?<br><br>Is our SM1 as mobile as it should be? An important consideration considering the only thing preventing it from being toast is its speed. Can modern technology make a light tank do better?<br><br>The answer to all of the above question is NO. The truth is, the SM1 is way outclassed and virtually obsolute when it comes to the technologies that have been developed for AFVs for its weight class, and worse, it can hardly do its job given a puny 75mm gun and armour that can along protect from small arms.<br><br>It can be argued that a technical with an 84 mounted might be more cost effective. Might as well dump all the armour on the SM1, given its nothing more then a half-measure eating up weight anyway!<br><br>If we can't use MBTs, the very least is that we get our tankies into a proper light tank. Technology existed for the Americans back in WW2 to use tanks far better then their M4 Sherman, but they did not, and they bled and suffered needlessly for it.</div>
