            <div class='col-md body'>The Primus and the Bionix both have the same transmission as the M8 Buford (GD HMPT-500EC). The Primus has the same engine as the M8 Buford (Detroit Diesel 6V-921A 550hp) and the Bionix has a similar, lower horsepower version (Detroit Diesel 6V-92TA 475hp). The suspension for the Bionix and M8 Buford are both hydropneumatic strut systems, and are the running gear in general are very similar. In fact, I have long suspected that the Bionix was developed with assistance from UD based on experience with the M8, especially since the 25mm autocannon is the same Bushmaster in the M2 Bradley, another UD vehicle.<br><br>Knowing MINDEF, they will want the light tank to have the same engine and/or transmission as well, to make battlefield repairs and logistics easier. So, I would not be surprised if we got a little bit of help from UD again for the light tank, or if we even adopt a modified M8 Buford. Heck, the M8 is narrower than the "magic" 3m width that MINDEF seems to want all our armored vehicles to conform to, and only 25 tons with maximum armor.</div>

No sure what it means.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our new tank needs to be stealthy, compatable with the rest of our forces, have enough protection to survive most infantry AT fire, highly mobile, and pack enough firepower to destroy MBTs from the front. Maybe mounting ATGMS on it is not such a bad idea.</div>

A light tank wun need to have all the internal space that the Bionix has for carrying troops, could cut that and lower the profile by a lot. It won't hurt to make this tank stealthy (ST did this with the Terrax) and run on band tracks though... since it has to be under 30 tons.<br><br></div>

I doubt even if you take away the troop area. There will be sufficlent space to put the ammo and the 120mm turret.</div>
