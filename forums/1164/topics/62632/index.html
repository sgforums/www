Nothing like an M109 chasis at all.  Singapore apparently did buy the M109 chassis as recorded in the FMS list. The question should be, did we buy it and found it not suitable or is there in fact another SP gun.<br><br>From the specs, I presume the 39 calibre was chosen because of the chassis size and weight - look, it is a darn light SP gun, only 28 tons. Second, the gun is NOT an FH88. It looks like the good o Israeli M72 or M68 in stored.  Make senses since SAF doesn't use the old M72 or M68 anymore and they are kept in the storage someone underground.  The burst rate also has the hallmark of the M68 gun. The FH88 gun has a much higher  8 rounds/min burst rate rather than 6.<br><br>Actually, after having a closer look, I think the gun looks like the Paladin gun.  Perhaps instead of getting the M109 chassis, SAF actually got the gun and integrated it onto a locally designed chassis?<br><br>M109A6:<br><img src="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/paladin.jpg"><br><br>ROC M109A2:<br><img src="http://www.emeraldesigns.com/matchup/gallery/roc/m109a2.jpg"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It really seems that MINDEF went for light weight and low crew requirements for this SPH, which is exactly what SAF needs. Although it is about the same weight and performance as the M109A6, it needs only four instead of six crew. There must be some pretty advanced automation systems in the turret, which is unusual in this weight category. Most highly automated SPH howitzers are in the 40+ ton range (AS90 and PZH2000).<br><br>The chassis looks like "son of Bionix". I don't think it is a M113, but completely new. The gun is definitely not FH88. It is probably of local design and manufacture, but bears the hallmarks of the M109A6. Maybe some reverse engineering of the M109A6 occured (shhh), or ST figured it out themselves or with help. Gun performance is only OK -- probably the limits of automation. 39 calibre is about as good as you're going to get on something less than 30 tons, so whatever...<br><br>The ground pressure looks worrisome. 180 kPa is so high that I think it's a typo. 80 kPa, like the M109 seems more like it, especially since it is about the same size and same weight. However, the chassis is so small compared to the turret and the treads are so narrow, that I have a sinking feeling it might be right. I hope the system is not top-heavy either! Don't want that TC to be turned to mush if it overturns -- enough KITs already.<br><br>Quite a few unknowns (typical MINDEF). No idea how much ammunition it carries, or the accuracy of the system. No word on armor protection (looks just thick enough to stop artillery fragments and small arms).<br><br>Still very very cool though. Even the name is nice. In Oriente Primus! Now I'm really excited. Whole night cannot sleep...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Imagine an artillery cannon capable of moving on its own, instead of having to be towed around.<br><br>Well, that is exactly what the Singapore Armed Forces wanted.<br><br>So, the Defence Science and Technology Agency and ST Kinetics hit the drawing board and designed a self-propelled Howitzer.<br><br>After six years of development, the mobile "Primus" is the envy of many other less-endowed bug guns.<br><br>But it is more than just a big-moving gun.<br><br>The SAF said it was four times more effective than howitzers towed behind heavy vehicles.<br><br>And it is what the 21st Batallion Singapore Artillery have always dreamed of having in their arsenal.<br><br>Colonel Lim Teck Huat, Chief of Artillery, said: "There has always been a gap in our inventory and when we support the combined arms divisional forces, the towed guns do have limitations in terms of mobility, the towed mortars, the short range is a liability and it could not support the armoured operations."<br><br>Equipped with a state-of-the-art targeting and navigation systems, the Primus can fire 155mm rounds at targets 30 kilometres away and with pin-point accuracy.<br><br>So artillery units can resort to a very effective hide, shoot and scoot strategy.<br><br>This means the gun crew can stay hidden under thick vegetation, fire at the enemy and then escape at speeds of up to 50 kilometres an hour.<br><br>To confuse the enemy and prevent detection, the Primus also used a smoke-screen defence system.<br><br>Andrew Tan, General Manager of Ordnance Development and Engineering Company, said: "We wanted to have a rapid fire capability and for that, the artillery rounds are heavy so we designed an ammo handling system and what it means is the work of two dozen men today that the field artillery is using, is now operated by just four men."<br><br>Fully loaded, the Primus weighs less than 30 tonnes.<br><br>And that includes armour which can withstand small arms fire from anything up to a 7.62 calibre general purpose machine gun.<br><br>For the gun crew it takes up to 10 months to be fully trained to operate such a high-tech weapon.<br><br>The public will get a chance to see the howitzer at the Asian Aerospace exhibition in February next year.<br><br>The SAF's new self-propelled howitzer was commissioned on Monday at Kranji Camp by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.<br><br>He praised the close cooperaton between the SAF and the local defence industries in building a weapon customised to Singapore's needs.<br><br>Rear Admiral Teo said the Primus was Singapore's technologically most complex product to date.<br><br>Separately, he said the Singapore Landing Ship Tank deployed to Iraq has arrived in the sea off the country and the morale among the men was good. - CNA</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe 39 Cal because of barrel length......the recoil mechanism looks huge in comparison to Paladin.<br><br>With 52 Cal harder to maneuver around rubber trees or more prevalent today palm trees.<br><br>Chassis could be a modified M109 made higher because of autoloader???

            <div class='col-md body'>The chassis looks like that of the M109's to me.... care to tell me what difference you guys see? BTW, look at part of the statement released:<br><br>"Several commercial-off-the-shelf systems (COTS) such as the M109A6 Paladin (USA), Type 75 ( Japan ), 2S3M1 (Ex-Soviet) and the AS90 Braveheart ( UK ) that fulfilled the prerequisites of possessing firepower with high mobility and battlefield survivability were considered. However, none could cater to our unique requirements in terms of lightweight mobility. Hence, the decision was made by DSTA to develop a completely new SPH with ST Kinetics. "<br><br>Interesting... Why would the Japs give access to their howitzer, when the Japs NEVER sell any indigineous equipment? Also, it's interesting that the howitzer's time into action is not revealed... Not to sound sour-grape that this is not a 52 cal arty piece, but if you look at the American FCS NLOS cannon, aaaait is a 39 cal weapon too. Their recent experiences gave them the impression that time into action was in some ways more valuable than range. (It seems that the utility of the Paladin's time into action impressed them quite a bit)<br><br></div>
