            <div class='col-md body'>I think the capability to transverse is a "good-to-have". needless to say, a 360 degree transverse is better than a limited arc like our SSPH.<br><br>However, to be able to transverse and fire a 360 degree will probably result in a heavier and/or larger vehicle.<br><br>From the article, weight is probably an important consideration. Actually, since it is going to fire from long range, a 360 degree transervse is not really very useful.<br><br>You will deploy facing the enemy.<br>When needed you fire, you fire.<br>It is highly unlikely that you will be needed to fire 180 degree to the rear, unless you are completely cutoff and isolated or there is an extremely fluid situation developing. Which is a rare scenario.<br>Why must we put up with a heavier and more expensive vehicle to cater to this rate situation.<br><br>Someone mentioned that we are getting 110 vehicles. Is that a fact?? Open domain??<br><br>If we are getting so many guns, that means that some of the existing 155mm towed will definitely be replaced.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The advantage of SPH overTowed Arty is well known:<br><br>a. Protection for crew<br>b. faster to deploy<br>c. faster to undeploy<br>d. better cross country capability.<br><br>I think one of the selling point to the SAF is that it only need 4 men to operate. The towed pieces like FH2000 need about 8 men at least to operate. The old M-71 pieces need 12 men is I am not wrong. And we are very short of men 4-men to one gun will really make the Army men salivate, now we can operate either the same number of guns with less men or operate more guns with the same number of men.<br><br>Of course weight is imporant also. Also lighter weight means smaller engine and cheaper maintenance.<br></div>

But most of the FH88 and M71s have been phased out already... so operationally, we only have FH2000.

            <div class='col-md body'>22 rds for a 155 seems okay. But it depends on the type of mission. The old M113 SP mortar carried 55-60 rds like the old 21 SA mortarmen told me. But mortar fire as compared to 155 howitzer is more inaccurate, so they depend on volume of fire to bracket a target...its a cost-effective area weapon IMHO.<br><br>155 shots tend to be more accurate, thanks to technological developments over the years...weather ballons, air density, humidity, etc etc....all that Firefinder (24 SA) jazz that no one understands.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> With the typical missions that the Primus would face, 22 rds would be sufficient, especially when ammo trains follow them around anyway.<br><br>Arty missions vary. So it depends on whether the mission requires sustained fire support, and if so, there has to be ammo carriers nearby. (btw, they do use BV206/Bronco for ammo and POL). But most missions that these SP guns/mortars usually do, are the typical shoot and scoot types...that's what those 21 SA guys told me...so the max would be about 2-3 shots before having to move again; that's their SOP. And they moved around ALOT from one location to another after firing a shot or two; it gets dizzying after awhile for them, racing up and down Area D. For them, their vehicle is their biggest chance of survival in a counterbattery attack, so basically they do everything within the confines of the vehicle during operational mode.<br><br>Apparently the person who suffers the most in the SP vehicle is the layer, or simply known as the No. 2 man, since he has to stay with the gun/mortar 24/7 in case of fire missions...lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ...I think I'll go nuts staying in such a confined space for an extended period of time...gimme the freedom of a scrambler anyday!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
