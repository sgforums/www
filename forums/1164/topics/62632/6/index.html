Ok in the case of Bionix the numbers may justify the cost. Still I'm not so sure the M113 or local variants should be put aside in future SAF requirements.</div>

As for the company trying to market it to other countries i'm not too sure since it is a goverment program.The system is officially still owned by the USArmy.But since it is not classified that maybe possible.<br>And the A-12?

            <div class='col-md body'>Johnston, no matter how you deny it, no matter how you praise Tom Clancy to the highest, there is no mistake that you are wrong here.<br><br>The fact is that United Defense Technologies has placed the M8 in its product catalogues and as Fairyland has pointed out, UD is actively promoting it at international arms and technology trade fairs.  This can only mean that the M8 has already completed all necessary evaluation and experimental procedures/stages and only needs the foreign customer to start production lines rolling.<br><br>http://www.janes.com/defence/land_forces/supplement/lav/lav_m8.shtml<br><br>Just because it's potential launch client backed off at the eleventh hour does not mean the main contractor will simply shlf the entire project indefinitely.</div>
