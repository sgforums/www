            <div class='col-md body'>Damn I was right! I mentioned quite some time back that I suspected this to be 39cal since I saw this back in 2001, and I was hoping that the in serivce version would be 52 cal instead. Sign......<br>Wonder why they didn't put one though, even the M109s have been upgraded to 47cal (as performed by the Dutch company RDM).<br>The chassis does seems like the M109 though, and I will have to disagree with some of you guys. After comparing the road wheels, the overall profile/shape, I still think it is the M109, albeit an improved version, with the most obvious change at the frontal part of the chassis. I don't suppose United Defense will have any problem altering the design at the front, maybe to accomodate an improved engine???<br>But I am still baffled as to why they don't just buy an SPH off the shelf. I would have shortlisted the PzH2000, the AS90 52cal, and even the Korean K9.<br>The only reason I could find is that of reducing the crew size, high degree of automation, and a requirement to maintain weight below 30 tons, so that our Bionix bridgelayers can accomodate em, although the Leguan and M60 AVLBs would have no problems whatsoever.<br>Give me a 52cal SPH anytime!!!!<br></div>

Watch the movie clip and you will gain some understanding.... The Primus vehicles are controlled by a command vehicle which calculates the firing solutions based on information received from the arty spotters (man or UAVs). Coordinations are fed to the command vehicle which are then directed to each of the Primus vehicles. In some sense, this is network centric way of fighting.</div>
