            <div class='col-md body'>S'porean high-tech artillery gun is unveiled<br>Designed to suit local conditions, Mindef says the self-propelled gun is SAF's 'most technologically complex product'<br><br>By David Boey<br><br>THE Singapore Armed Forces yesterday unveiled the latest addition to its arsenal - a 155mm artillery gun that moves like a tank.<br><br>Called the Singapore Self-Propelled Howitzer 1 or Primus, the locally developed guns will give the army's combined arms divisions more firepower, speed and accuracy.<br><br>This has been achieved by combining the armour and mobility of a tracked vehicle, like a tank, with the firepower of a 155mm gun, the largest calibre artillery piece in the SAF.<br><br>The decision to develop the Primus was made after a survey of some of the world's best self-propelled guns from the United States, Britain, Japan and Russia found them either too heavy or too wide for local terrain, said the Defence Ministry.<br><br>Chief Artillery Officer Lim Teck Huat said: 'We made a market survey in 1995 and 1996 and considered the operational guns around the world. Well, they had a lot of firepower, were highly mobile and very survivable but they were also very heavy, mostly around 50 tonnes, and we needed something lighter.'<br><br>The SAF needed the Primus to weigh less than 30 tonnes and be no wider than 3m, for it to move across bridges and through vegetation here.<br><br>By April 2000, the first working prototype was rolled out, using a vehicle chassis adapted from the US Army's Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and M109 self-propelled gun.<br><br>After another three years of testing, the guns were unveiled by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean yesterday.<br><br>The result, Mindef says, is the creation of 'arguably the lightest and most responsive self-propelled howitzer in its class'.<br><br>Before the Primus, the SAF's stable of 155mm guns - the FH-88 and FH-2000 - usually had to be towed by trucks.<br><br>Towed guns require more time to get into action and at least eight gunners to operate, compared to the Primus which only needs a crew of four and is ready to fire in less than a minute.<br><br>Beneath its tough armour-plated exterior is a host of sophisticated on-board computers that control navigation and automate the handling of ammunition.<br><br>Altogether, the Primus is the SAF's 'most technologically complex product designed to date', added Mindef.<br><br>At its commissioning yesterday, there were no formal military parades. Instead, the ceremony took place out in the field at Kranji Camp, where six guns swung into action in a demonstration that showcased its ability to 'hide, shoot and scoot'.<br><br>The first artillery unit to receive these guns is the 21st Battalion, Singapore Artillery.<br><br>The unit started using them early this year and is gearing up for a battalion live-firing exercise code-named Thunder Warrior. This will take place in New Zealand early next year.<br><br>After seeing the guns in action, Rear Admiral (NS) Teo said: 'It's an example of the cooperation between the Defence Science and Technology Agency, the SAF and Singapore Technologies Kinetics that we're able to develop something which can fit our unique needs.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"I personally think the Project A***** team has done a wonderful job."</strong><br><br>ha ha ha... nice try, the PMT is not called Project A*****... try again and try harder...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>Armour is probably a thin single layer</strong><br><br>sorry buddy, can't tell you the exact thickness of the armour.  But suffice to say that it is sufficient to protect the crew against small arms and RPG to some extent.  There's no ERA though, but we don't need that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong>M109 has a different engine &amp; transmission has compared wif the Primus, it shared the same transmission as the Bionix<br><br>Dun tell me they get Paladin chassis with engine &amp; transmission which are customised to SAF needs</strong><br><br>yes, the M109 has a different engine and transmission, but the chasis is still the same... and yes, Primus shares the same transmission as Bionix.<br><br><strong>Someone has posted quite a while back that when the SPH is in service, the current towed guns be placed in storage.</strong><br><br>well, go tell this 'someone' that the SP is not meant to replace the FH88 and FH2000... so no, the current towed guns will not be placed in storage.<br><br><strong>So it is not exactly M109s chassis but greatly modified UDLP one.<br><br>Then I think ST &amp; Mindef has no right to claim that it is locally produced SPH, afterall the chassis are from UDIP.</strong><br><br>trust me it is exactly the M109 chasis and it has not been greatly modified.  The SPH is considered locally developed.  if you look at the package as a whole instead of just the chasis, you'll realise that the gun is local-developed and the integration was done by our engineers.  of course there are some stuff that are COTs e.g. the on-board computers etc.  why build every single part from scratch when some of the stuff is readily available?<br><br><strong>Isn't 30km too short range for a SP howitzer ? . Anyway , what is the maximum range for the american SP howitzer ?</strong><br><br>The SPH isn't going to be firing from our soil... 30km is very decent considering that this is a 155/39.  Besides, the range for the M109 is 30km (with HE RAP and M203 propellant) and 22km unassisted.<br><br><strong>But how could they claimed that they designed the SPH if the chassis, more than 50% of the whole project was done by others &amp; the rest most probably with help from the angmo.</strong><br><br>if you claim that more than 50% of the whole project was done by others, then you obviously do not know how this project has managed... look, you need to see the system as a whole.  we only bought the chasis and engines from UDLP.  The gun and various integration works were all locally done.  More than 50% of the whole project was local...<br>trust me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ahh....nice new toys...Its a nice complement to the current towed artillery that we have.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I remember the old 21 SA when I was in Kranji....they used to practice(during the mortar conversion course) around the field area near the SOC ground. This was back in 1996...the pics that you're seeing, the SP guns are from Bravo battery (Gun 1, 4, and 6, I think). My platoon mates and I got to see them 'action front' their SP mortar (with camo net and all)...impressive...only took them 2 minutes + - to get into firing position, and about 1 minute + - to stow away and prepare to displace. This was based on the old system of having a runner plant the firing poles, lay the tele-J wire and all. I imagine it would be the same timing for these SP guns considering that they don't have to plant poles anymore...lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On another occasion, I had the rare chance of seeing 20 SA practice in Area D (rare, since they hardly step out of their Yio Chu Kang training area). Towed gun really takes awhile to deploy?!! About nearly 10 minutes in total (including camo net)...and 5 minutes + - to prepare to displace...<br><br>The basis for keeping towed artillery is meant more for infantry support than for armour support. That's why 21 SA has been kept all these years even when 20 SA (120 towed mortar) was disbanded...for armour support operations. I think the current 120 SP mortars will still be kept though...in active and reserve armour battalions, since it would provide good short-range (abt 6 km max) indirect fire support. The real long range firepower would then be these new babies, since they are faster to displace than towed FH 88 or FH 2000.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If we had it, i'm sure people would have spotted it. As most of us know, the raytheon MLRS was in consideration years ago but kinda dropped off the radar screen, perhaps too politically sensitive until malaysia's purchase of the astro. While devastating i think it is not as practical as a SPH cos' of the expensive rockets. (of course, there are always less expensive options like the south african valkiri 127mm or even the katushas)<br><br>As for the SM1...yeah, we could use a light tank replacement. Perhaps that's the next big thing coming up.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
