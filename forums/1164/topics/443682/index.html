              <p>Reuters reports that USN eyeing stationing "several" littoral combat ships (LCS) in Singapore.</p>
              <p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/u-navy-eyes-stationing-ships-singapore-013943985.html">http://news.yahoo.com/u-navy-eyes-stationing-ships-singapore-013943985.html</a></p>
              <p>This was first publicly suggested by former secretary of defense Robert Gates during the Jun 2011 Shangri-La conference but no numbers were suggested then.</p>
              <p>The LCS carries modular mission packages which can comprise either mine countermeasures, anti-submarine or anti-surface (targeting fast attack crafts).</p>
              <p>Its far enough from China not to be seen as targeted at China. Singapore offers good/safe docking facilities with personnel hub transfers from Guam/Diego Garcia. Its also a lot nearer to hotspots eg Gulf or APAC region than US homeports.</p>
              <p>Each LCS carries twice the complement of helos than the Formidable frigates but can share maintenance due to commonalities bet the MH-60s and S-70s. The paucity in AAW is made up by RSAF air cover which would likely be networked-link. The LCS is capable of speeds twice as fast as the Formidables eg 50kt sprint speeds.</p>
              <p>2 classes of LCS have been completed with 20 more on order. Final number may exceed 50. This move will significantly boost ASW/MCM capabilities in this region.</p>

              <p>I suppose this will take place long after LCS-5 is delivered. LCS warfare capabilities are still not mature.</p>

              I must have missed the part, I don't see any Thailand deployment for the US?
              
              And call me a cynic, but isn't there a serious debate in the US, going on about the utility and cost of the LCS project? For all we know, this might end up as "invisible ships"  stationed in Singapore, US budget cuts and all.
              
              I'm not betting on any being stationed in the Phillipines, can be seen as the US arming the Phillipinos as they and China have clashed over the Spratleys fairly frequently. Too provocative.

              <p>they are building these ships in oz for the us military with the technology and ship contractors using american technology.nothing is australian except the labourers.the reason why its not based in oz is because it would cost a bomb to maintain them in oz along with military personell.spore seems cheaper,faster and better.and spore leaves usa military alone and not interfere in their business in any way unlike some of its allies.there was a situationwhere the commentator over a radio said the   the us military base in Darwin was under the control of an australian even!what gives???makes the us military or any military look like complete idiots.thats probably why the us navy chose spore.its an insult if they send their ships there only to find that its partially controlled by someone lese that isnt from its own country.</p>
              <p>so its common sense to base them in spore as its a safer place at night as compared to oz plus they have MGM casino and all thpse american stuff thats more exciting in spore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>that is good to counter chinese air-craft carrier. several small combat ships carring attacking planes and other hi tech weapons is better than a carrier fighting group. togetther with singapore and Philipines own up to date navy and army should able to balance the power here. Also USA should try "to buy" over the heart of thailand people, Lao and Burma people by helping them in one way or other. This is what China is doing now.

              <p>"Similarly, 2025 may see P-8A Poseidon aircraft or unmanned broad area 
                      maritime surveillance aerial vehicles periodically deploy to the 
                      Philippines or Thailand to help those nations with maritime domain 
                      awareness."</p>
              <p>While I share your concerns that the LCS program may turn out grossly underfunded, I believe it would be less tragic than say slashing the F-35 program.</p>
              <p>The LCS program has been far less troubled because it is hardly cutting edge. Also, one of its multiple roles is to carry on the OHP-class frigates' ASW mission. Hopefully lower technological risk and a vital strategic mission will mitigate the impact of budget cuts, and in the worst case, fortunately all carriers are on track and 60+ of 75 planned Arleigh Burke ships are already on hand for any confrontation with China.</p>

              Anyone believe Hitman when he said the Aussies are building LCSs for the Yanks? I may have just discovered a salt mine, so big the pinch of salt I'm going to take this statement with.
                      
              So Hit, which type are they building there? The Freedom variant or the Independence one?
                      
              wsy, the LCS can't carry fighters.
                      
              alise, with the reputation of being overpriced, I think the Navy's more likely to pump funding into getting more "standard" stuff like the Burkes.
