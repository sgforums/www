            <div class='col-md body'>REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE NAVYÂ’S (RSN) FRIGATE PROGRAMME<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>In March 2000, MINDEF signed a contract with Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) of France for the construction of six frigates for the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). DCN is a reputable shipyard that designed and built the French NavyÂ’s low signature La Fayette-class frigates. Under the technology transfer arrangement, DCN will design and build the first ship while the remaining five will be built locally by Singapore Technologies Marine. The six new frigates will replace the RSNÂ’s Missile Gunboats which have been in service for more than 30 years.<br><br>SHIPÂ’S CAPABILITIES<br><br>The new frigates are highly capable warships designed to be stealthy and are equipped with advanced combat systems. They also have longer endurance and are able to stay at sea for longer periods of time. With a length of 114m, the frigates possess better sea keeping qualities. Each frigate is powered by four MTU1 diesel engines that can provide speed in excess of 25 knots. Stealth technology has been incorporated in many features of the shipÂ’s design. This ensures that the frigates have low radar cross section signatures and increased survivability. Each frigate is designed to carry a medium-class helicopter capable of complementing the ship in Anti-surface and Anti-submarine warfare.<br><br>Each frigate will be manned by a crew of 70. To support the lean manning, a high level of automation is necessary. The Integrated Bridge System (IBS) and the Ship Management System (SMS) incorporate many advanced features to enable safe and effective monitoring and control of the various machinery and systems onboard.  This is an example of how the RSN leverages on technology to improve our work processes onboard.<br><br>The frigates will be equipped with advanced state-of-the-art combat capabilities allowing them to perform a wide spectrum of missions and to deal with various threats in all dimensions of naval warfare Â– surface, air and underwater. Surveillance is provided by the Thales Herakles Multi-function Radar (MFR). As a three-dimensional search and fire control radar, the MFR is able to perform all round, long range air and surface surveillance, while simultaneously controlling weapons and missiles against hostile targets.  The MFR is integrated with the Aster Anti-Missile Missile (AMM) system. Supplied by MBDA2, the Aster AMM System is designed to meet the air defence needs of the frigate against aircraft and sea skimming anti-ship missiles. The Aster is a two-stage missile with a powerful thrust and aerodynamic control to enable high agility and manoeuvrability.<br><br>The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability of the frigate is provided by the EDO3 Active Low Frequency Towed Sonar (ALOFTS) system and the Eurotorp A244S torpedo. The Active Low Frequency Towed Sonar system provides the ship with long range underwater detection and classification capabilities, while the A244 lightweight torpedo is designed to counter submarine threats operating in the littorals.<br><br>The frigates will also be equipped with the Harpoon anti-ship surface missile system and the OTO Melara 76mm naval gun. Both systems are currently in service onboard other RSN ships. The Integrated Communications System (ICS) is provided by CET of Singapore Technologies Electronics.<br><br>Command and control of the various sensor and weapon systems onboard each frigate is achieved via an indigenously designed Combat Management System (CMS). Developed by DSTA and in close co-operation with RSN and DSO-NL, the CMS  is the first system designed with embedded intelligence for  track management, identification and weapon assignment functions. All combat systems will be operated using  Standard Operating Common Consoles supplied by SES of Singapore Technologies Electronics. These operating consoles are located in the Combat Information Centre of the ship, where the command team will direct and orchestrate all warfare activities.<br><br>The platform characteristics, the combat systems configuration and a computer-aided design picture of RSNÂ’s new frigates are detailed in the appendix to this fact sheet.<br><br>PROGRAMME STATUS<br><br>The frigate programme is progressing smoothly. All six frigates are in various stages of construction today. The first frigate, RSS FORMIDABLE, will be launched on 7 January 2004 at DCN Lorient, France. The launch of RSS FORMIDABLE will mark a significant milestone for the frigate programme. The frigate will then be fitted with combat systems and platform equipment before undergoing sea trials in December 2004 in Lorient. The first frigate is due to sail back to Singapore in early 2005. Local construction of the remaining five frigates in Singapore at Singapore Technologies Marine is also progressing well. The plate cutting for the sixth frigate took place in September 2003, while the keel for the third frigate was recently laid in November 2003.<br><br>The frigate programme represents the continuous effort of the RSN to improve its capabilities in order to complement and enhance the operational effectiveness of the SAF.<br><br>1MTU Friedrichshafen is a business unit of DaimlerChrysler.
