"This airplane has delivered in all areas as advertised, if not a little bit better," said Cdr. Dale Horton, executive officer for the Lincoln's F/A-18E squadron, VFA-115.<br><br>But that doesn't mean the deployment has been without setbacks. For instance, the Navy found that its three Advanced Targeting Flir (Atflir) pods aren't yet reliable enough for operational use. The pods are still in development and were rushed to the field, so there were questions from the outset about their performance.<br><br>Those early concerns turned out to be accurate. The pods' cameras are unreliable, and the system suffers from inaccuracies in the targeting laser, forcing VFA-115 to rely on the older and less capable Nite Hawk it also brought on deployment. But the Nite Hawk's imaging sensor isn't deemed good enough to identify moving targets, so F/A-18E pilots will likely be limited to attacking stationary targets using either laser-guided or GPS-guided munitions.<br><br>One problem with Atflir was that its pre-production status meant there was no training system for technicians to learn from, noted Lt. Cdr. Bruce Brosch, the air wing's maintenance officer. There also was no established spare parts supply. Despite these hurdles, the availability rates were higher than some expected, said Capt. Scott Swift, the deputy air wing commander.<br><br>Although the Pentagon's operational test community last year expressed concern about using pre-deployment Atflir and other immature systems, Navy officials argued that operational needs justified the move. Now Navy officials feel encouraged by what they have seen from Atflir. The imagery was of high quality, and when the system reaches desired reliability rates, it should allow F/A-18E/Fs to attack moving targets, Horton said.<br><br>The Atflir problems revealed on the Lincoln appear to have been largely overcome with the next generation of pods that are on the USS Nimitz, which is now deploying to the Middle East with another F/A-18E squadron and the first operationally deployed two-seat F/A-18Fs. Reports from the Nimitz's carrier air wing 11 (CVW-11) note the laser is now operational and the infrared and electro-optical images are ........</div>
