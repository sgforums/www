              <h1 class="clr">Police say phone scams, crimes against elderly are areas of concern</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: While the overall crime situation in Singapore is under
              control, police said on Wednesday cheating phone scams, crimes against
              elderly and thefts from vehicles remain areas of concern.</p>
              <p>Phone scam callers make random cold calls to try their luck on the unsuspecting public.</p>
              <p>In
              a mid—year crime report released on Wednesday, the police said the
              culprits have adopted several new tactics in the first half of this
              year.</p>
              <p>They included lucky draw or lottery scams which persuade
              victims to make advance payments to claim a prize. A new variation saw
              culprits using SMS to inform victims that they have won in lucky draws.</p>
              <p>There
              were also cases where culprits claimed that the victims have won luxury
              cars in lucky draws and asked them to transfer money for administrative
              fees.</p>
              <p>The police said some 180 victims fell prey to these scams
              in the first six months of the year, and lost about S$2.4 million in
              cash when they transferred money via remittance houses to various
              overseas recipients.</p>
              <p>Another area of concern was crimes against
              the elderly, according to the police. Robbery and snatch theft
              targeting elderly victims increased 25 per cent in the period, from 116
              to 145 cases in the first half of 2008.</p>
              <p>Generally, elderly
              victims were robbed at common areas of HDB estates in the day when
              victims were alone and going about their daily routine.</p>
              <p>The
              police also said that thefts from vehicles was another key crime
              concern. A 26 per cent rise in theft from vehicle cases was noted in
              the first six months of 2008.</p>
              <p>In most of the about 1,000 cases
              reported, culprits would smash the side windows of cars or tamper with
              the rear compartment of motorcycles to gain entry to the vehicles.</p>
              <p>Commercial crimes went up by 11.7 per cent, from 1,583 cases to 1,769 in the first half of 2008.</p>
              <p>But
              Singapore remains a safe place to live and work in, said the police.
              The overall crime rate registered a marginal one per cent increase from
              the same period in 2007 to some 16,368 cases.</p>
              <p>Apart from rigorous
              enforcement and public education, police said community engagement is
              an important component in the overall strategy to combat crime.</p>
              <p>Increasingly,
              the police are making use of new media to reach out to the public, such
              as the launch of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) YouTube channel
              earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The police are also leveraging on technology and forensic evidence to investigate crimes. — 938Live/yb</p>
