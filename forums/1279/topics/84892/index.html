So, here we are, with 960,190,851,etc getting 11XX and 10XX habits and even the 8XX 9XX onez, and the feeders get the new ones? Wheres the fairness? This brings me to think of the type of buses we get at svc 410! MB0405s! What unfairness! In my opinion, if WDL and YIS feeders can get nice buses, svcs like 238 and 410 shud get VSOs or even the new, unreleased B10BLE CNGs!</div>
