            <div class='col-md body'>Sin Ming Terminal currently hold CSS 605 and nothing more than an "extended" bus stop with more parking lots. It is located at Blk 22A, Sin Ming Rd. Currently, SBST 130 (Ang Mo Kio - Shenton Way) calls at this bus stop also.<br><br>Thus, it definitely won't last long. When CSS 605 is going to be withdrawn in the few years to come, it will be converted back to a bus stop and the extra space probably turned into additional car park space. And SBST 130 will continue to call at the bus stop on its way to Shenton Way.</div>
