              <p>from the photo and from the news, the bus is still at 2nd lane and the wheel of the bus is not tilted to the left also... accordingly to the news, a worker have been arrested for negligence... most likely the worker accidently swing the crane into the wrong direction...</p>

              he most likely didn't look out for the extended part of
              the plant pruning truck. It's the same thing as the 7499A accident

              <p>Its obvious that the bus was alrdy past the lorry on the left when the crane started to swing towards the bus. IF the crane was already there in the first place (and that the BC have not seen it) could u kindly explain why the first 2 window panels wasnt affected ? And that only the 3rd window onwards was affected by the crane crashing into the bus ?</p>
              <p>If like what you've mentioned that the BC is at fault, why didnt the police detained the BC but rather the bagala instead ?</p>

              <p>if you look properly at the damage, it began from the second window onwards which is well behind the driver's position. how on earth would you expect him to see the crane? by turning his head to check his blind spot which even then would not allow him to have a full view of the crane's position? moreover 9400X was still in the centre lane when impact occured. and the position at which he stopped indicated that if the crane was not angled out, he would have cleared the obstacle. if he had decided to cut into lane 3 early he would have stopped in the middle of the lane.</p>
              <p>as for responsibility, you don't have to worry as whether a passenger died or was injured, SBST will make ample arrangements to ensure that they receive the assistance they deserve.</p>
              <p>i stand by my position that you, as someone who does not have a driving license yet, are fully unaware of how driving habits work.</p>

              <p><strong>One killed, 8 injured in accident along Chai Chee Street</strong><br> <span class="update">By Evelyn Choo | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 16 July 2010 1825 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : An accident between a double-decker bus Service Number
               87 and a large tree-pruning vehicle left a 50-year-old male passenger 
              dead and several others injured on Friday.
              <br> <br> The collision occurred along Chai Chee Street in Bedok.
              <br> <br> Police have arrested a 33-year-old Bangladeshi foreign worker from the 
              landscape management company for causing death by negligence.
              <br> <br> Shattered glass windows, a fallen tree, and major traffic congestion 
              were the result of the accident which left one dead and eight passengers
               - including a pregnant woman - injured.
              <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The bus was behind the lorry when it went to the middle lane. But little
               did the bus driver know that the head of the crane was protruding into 
              the middle lane, and this scraped against the side of the bus.</span></strong> <br> <br> The loud sound from the collision attracted hundreds of residents from 
              nearby blocks.
              <br> <br> One resident said: "Like glass shattering. It sounded massive and 
              sharp."
              <br> <br> A second commented: "I saw them moving the victims down from the upper 
              deck. It looked quite serious."
              <br> <br> Three bus passengers were taken to hospitals, while others refused 
              treatment, citing minor injuries.
              <br> <br> Both the bus driver and crane operator were not injured in the accident.
              <br> <br> They remained calm and silent while clean-up work was going on. - CNA/ms </span></p>

              <p>I think the lorry crane operator is solely at fault, which is why the police arrested the bangladeshi as reported on TV. The following are possible safety lapses from the lorry operator and company:</p>
              <p>1) The boom of the crane must not protrude onto the path of vehicles at all times; because the lorry company, supervisor and crane operator have a duty of care to ensure safety at all times. This is under the MOM Occupation Safety and Health Act and I believe the crane operator and company will be investigated and probably prosecuted by MOM.</p>
              <p>2) If the boom is necessary to be extended, then the supervisor in-charge got to place cones and signages to the front or back of the lorry to block the affected lane so that vehicles will avoid hitting the crane. And the boom must not protrude onto the adjacent lanes where vehicles are free to move at all times.</p>
              <p>3) Did the lorry company station a person as a look-out for any safety lapses when the crane is in operation? Solely depending on the crane operator is not the solution to ensure safety to the public and motorists. </p>
              <p>4) I think SBST and the victims can claim the lorry company's insurance company and it is mandatory for contractors to purchase insurance policies for every project they undertake.</p>

              <p>How the heck you expect the driver to see through the upper deck to watch the crane boom and you expect the side-mirrors to cover those areas?</p>
              <p>Its not a freak accident at all...its a case of negligence, and serious safety lapses on the part of the working crew manning the site.</p>

              <p>Overall, it was a freak accident by the crane driver which had

              MOM is likely to take tough action against the landscape company and the crane operator. The crane operator may probably be jailed since a life is lost. And since this landscape company is doing NParks maintenance contract (a govt project), it's likely to be blacklisted or even banned from bidding for govt tenders for a period of time.

              <p>1. i'm inclined to think the bus driver was doing his normal speed or even slower.</p>
              <p>2. of course the motion of the bus caused it. well, even if he had applied the brakes immediately (which i feel he would have done so) the bus will take time to stop anyway! whether or not the length of the damage would have been shorter does not really matter.</p>
              <p>3. you jolly well dont take the chance, so you expect poor bus driver to stop in the centre of the road and wait for the crane to move off? or expect him to do vehicle acrobatics and cut all the way to the extreme right lane and then back to the left lane to call at the bus stop. im sure the bus driver would have exercised due dilligence in ensuring that he had sufficient clearance to pass the lorry.</p>
