              <p>even if the bus driver slows down to a snail's pace, the impact of the crane would still cause substantial damage. and what do you know about his speed during impact? you conveniently assume that he was going very fast to have caused such damage. do you realise that braking distance also plays a part in this case?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regardless, the crane should not have protruded out of the cordoned work space and in this instance, the crane operator is already legally at fault. If its necessary to have more workspace, the contractor should have cordoned off a wider section of the road to work with.  Just wait and see how MOM deals with this matter.</div>

              All crane operators must be qualified and possess a certificate to operate after attending and passing the course at BCA. Or else, its illegal to operate the crane.

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Quoted from the article in yahoo:</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"The bus was behind the lorry when it went to the middle lane. But little did the bus driver know that the head of the crane was protruding into the middle lane, and this scraped against the side of the bus."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a crucial paragraph which summarizes and points out the exact cause of the accident. The crane driver had negligently allowed the head of the crane to protrude to the middle lane, and inferring from this paragraph, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the bus captain was obviously at the lower deck and thus having the possibility of not knowing this happening at the top deck</span></strong> (bear in mind there is no digital footage of the upper deck like those in the new buses), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">thereby not stopping the bus on time</span></strong> which contributed to the crane scraping the whole row of windows, further causing innocent casulties. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">In conclusion, I believe a large part of the responsibility shall lie in the part of the contractor, while the responsilibility of the BC shall also be accounted to too for this accident. </span></span></p>

              <p>By anyway, <br>Theres no need for the bus to speed up since the lorry is already in a stationary position isnt it ?<br><br>Dont see the reason why the bus need to speed up when the bus stop is near to the scene of accident.</p>
              <p>Lets say the bus did speed up. <br>from the photos shown is pretty obvious that its the crane's fault as the bus did not even "eat" into the left most lane (the lane the lorry was on).</p>

              <p>2) I don know why the crane should be on the right side at that point of time as the BC was suppose to be going near a bus stop at that time so that vehicle should not even be there in the first place. As such vehicle can climb onto the pedestrial road, drive over curb and do the prunning.</p>
              <p>3) That road is very selffish as there are little space for the BC to actually drive thru from first lane to 3rd lane and within 100m, need to stop in bus stop. You think is driving super machine ah, you teach the BC how to do it without offending anyone.</p>

              <p>are you the accident investigator? can you provide me the data projections as to the ideal speed the bus should travel at so that the 'outcome wont be so horrible'?</p>
              <p>even if the BC was driving at 20kmh the damage would most likely be largely similar to what had happened. but which reasonable driver would do 20kmh along a trunk road and moreover, had assessed to have sufficient side clearance to move faster than that?</p>

              <p>You are coming from a car driver's point of view. A bus has a much larger momentum even at low speeds, so low you'll cry but it's enough to cause sizeable damage to something like a car.</p>
              <p>And I'm sure he is slow enough to have stopped the bus in 8 metres from the point of impact to the end of impact, and that takes into account reaction time too. I don't understand where the 20 metres come from, when the length of the bus itself is only 12 metres.</p>
