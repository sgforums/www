              <p><strong>From Accidents and Breakdown thread:<br><br>Crane hits bus, man dies</strong></p>
              <p>A BUS commuter died and three other 
              passengers were injured when
                                      a lorry carrying a crane hit a double-decker bus
               along Bedok North
                                      Road on Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p>The collision happened at about 3.30 pm. The 
              three injured
                                      commuters were taken to hospital.</p>
              <p>Residents in the area said they heard a loud 
              crash, followed by
                                      shattering of glass windows.</p>

              <p>BC's job is to drive bus, not to look at branches and cranes. If BC crash into bus-stop (Like in Eunos Link), its either bus or driver's fault lor.. These years seeing a lot of bus accidents in the East side of Singapore. </p>

              <p><br>Even if there wasn't a safety zone it should be common sense to know that one must get some distance clearance of another vehicle before attempting to overtake and not switch lanes immediately past the vehicle.</p>
              <p>I stand by my position that the driver is majority at fault this time; SBST needs to take up some form of responsibility this time since after all a passenger died in their buses.</p>

              <p><br>The problem is, there's a blind spot looking at these cranes when it's extruded. Tat's why e safety cordon is for. It could happen to those vans w/ tall shelter looking at e height.</p>
              <p>As for accident, does not mean SBS or whoever has to take responsibility. Just like passengers fall down because a car cut right in front of e bus means bus co gotta take responsibilty?</p>

              <p>Even though a BC's job is to drive bus,they still have to look out for hazards on the road,its part of their job because it about passenger safety (Tell me how many BC's have you seen just drive straight into something that he can see that will endanger the passenger's life,none right?) </p>
