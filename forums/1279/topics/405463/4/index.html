              <p>You are coming from a car driver's point of view. A bus has a much larger momentum even at low speeds, so low you'll cry but it's enough to cause sizeable damage to something like a car.</p>
              <p>And I'm sure he is slow enough to have stopped the bus in 8 metres from the point of impact to the end of impact, and that takes into account reaction time too. I don't understand where the 20 metres come from, when the length of the bus itself is only 12 metres.</p>

              <p>even if the BC was driving at 20kmh the damage would most likely
              be largely similar to what had happened. but which reasonable

              to have sufficient side clearance to move faster than that?</p>

              <p>Of course, travelling at a slower speed will help, but how slow do you think it takes to be safe when something comes crashing at you? If everything can be ideally slow such that the outcome won't be so horrible, then I think we have the perfect remedy to reduce the chances of a collision: drive at snail's pace and stop immediately at any signs of danger.</p>

              <p>So based on what our dear friend had mentioned, from now onwards, Buses must overtake stationary vehicles at least 1 car lane away. Also, they must drive at less than 10km/h and be prepared to stop anytime.</p>

              <p><br>First, like to point out that i already say that the road's traffic is high. How to slow when you are already slow. 10Km/hr or 0km/hr? Anyone drive as caution to 10km/hr? Ask someone who drives a 5ton, they are already driving at max 50km/hr so slowing down for them is 20km/hr</p>

              <p><br> First, like to point out that i already say that the road's traffic
              is high. How to slow when you are already slow. 10Km/hr or 0km/hr?
              Anyone drive as caution to 10km/hr? Ask someone who drives a 5ton,
              they are already driving at max 50km/hr so slowing down for them is
              20km/hr</p>
