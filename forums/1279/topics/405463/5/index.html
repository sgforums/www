              <p>if the bus is travelling fast, the whole roof should already
              collapse.</p>
              <p>can do some simple maths... 20km/hr = 20000m/hr = 333m/min =
              5.555m/sec. so the bus will travel around 5.555m/sec if travelling at
              20km/hr.. normal reactive time is around 0.8sec.. so by the time the BC
              heard the sound and slam the brake, bus will have travel 4.4444m at
              least, and by the time the bus stop, it will have travel another
              5.5555m (let say it can stop in 1 sec)... i would believe that the Bus
              is travelling at 15km/hr... which is consider as ROAD hogging? How
              can this be fast?</p>

              <p>if based on jgho83 view, think will cause big traffic jam... imagine the bus see the lorry infront cutting tree, so it stop and try to filter to 2nd lane, wait for 30 sec before finally some one let the BC filter, then as jgho83 mention to keep one lane clear, so the bus MUST STOP and then try to filter to the right lane? is this possilbe? dun think so... then after filter to the right lane, must slowly filter back to 2nd lane and then 1st lane to stop at bus stop? how long will it take?</p>

              <p><br>think they big? Can they brake in time as your car? Also they need more space being 2.55m width compared to 1.4m for a typical saloon car, so when they filter they need more space.</p>
              <p>I also drive but I always give way to buses as far as I can.. simply those taking buses their travelling time is alrdy long enough and I take buses to commute most of e time.</p>
              <p>Rushing? If the attempted filtering bus is alrdy blocking your view of e hazard, shouldn't you slow down? if it turns out to be a trailer turning out, wouldn't you get killed by your speeding n refusal to give way to bus finally owning yourself w/ a head - head accident? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>not only tat, those passengers standing all trip and fall because of your selfish remark because of the braking to avoid hitting your speeding car.</p>
              <p>It's obvious from here many singaporeans should be made 1 day tasked to take and standing onboard a public bus and made to taste ppl refusal to give way + heavy braking to siam. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>No one is defending anyone.</p>
              <p>But simply it's because it's alrdy clear there's govt regulation over tree pruning, blind spots on the bus driver driving double decker buses, e way how the crane hit the bus.</p>
              <p>I'll say tis, compared to Malaysian drivers (yes they could be less 'disciplined') but they're better than Singaporeans onto defensive driving when approached by heavy vehicles. They understand the hazards posed by heavy lorry n buses vs Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>freedom of speech does not equate you're allow to not take responsibility for your words. hostility is very subjective. as for inaccuracy, i think you might want to provide some answers to our queries to make things a little more "accurate", like putting a number to how slow should the speed limit be to make it safe for every motorist, and explaining how you are able to know that the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed.</p>
              <p>1. that's because many of us here feels you're not being in touch with reality, no matter how much you assert yourself to be.</p>
              <p>2. go slower... how slow is slow? don't try to brush it off. we want to know how sensible you are. not even the traffic police will tell you how slow you should go near a stationary vehicle.</p>
              <p>3. you have alleged that the driver was not going slow enough and could have gone slower. now, isn't the driver going to take a defence against your accusation? if you don't want us to put up a defence on how sensible is sensible, then don't accuse others of not being sensible enough to judge how slow he should drive.</p>
