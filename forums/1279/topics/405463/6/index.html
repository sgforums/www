              <p>for the record, no one has given come up with any physics or mathematical calculations yet, but you're already looking at it with tinted spectacles. you back your assertions with neither facts nor sense but just rhetoric, even when asked to show cause.</p>
              <p>and there is no need to twist your words. your posts were not being edited, but we're not amused if you think you have the answer to the problem which no road safety experts have, and put the blame squarely on the bus captain.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">if the bus is travelling fast, the whole roof should already collapse.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">can do some simple maths... 20km/hr = 20000m/hr = 333m/min = 5.555m/sec. so the bus will travel around 5.555m/sec if travelling at 20km/hr.. normal reactive time is around 0.8sec.. so by the time the BC heard the sound and slam the brake, bus will have travel 4.4444m at least, and by the time the bus stop, it will have travel another 5.5555m (let say it can stop in 1 sec)... i would believe that the Bus is travelling at 15km/hr... which is consider as ROAD hogging? How can this be fast?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">tamago&gt; is this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> some form of calculation? So much for "for the record". I also think you got nothing constructive to say other than aiming at me isnt it. You look at other threads and people also leave all kinds of remarks. Be it constructive, non constructive, poking fun of another's comment etc.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you want people to "Stick to topic" then many other people should also "leave the thread" when they talk about other things beside the topic?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">And do open your eyes and read carefully. I did not pin the fault squarely on the bus driver. In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my very first post</span> in this thread, i start of with "The bus driver <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also</span> goondu lah" </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When i use the word "also", i put some of the blame with the worker too.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I think the lorry crane operator is solely at fault, which is why the police arrested the bangladeshi as reported on TV. The following are possible safety lapses from the lorry operator and company:</p>
              <p>1) The boom of the crane must not protrude onto the path of vehicles at all times; because the lorry company, supervisor and crane operator have a duty of care to ensure safety at all times. This is under the MOM Occupation Safety and Health Act and I believe the crane operator and company will be investigated and probably prosecuted by MOM.</p>
              <p>2) If the boom is necessary to be extended, then the supervisor in-charge got to place cones and signages to the front or back of the lorry to block the affected lane so that vehicles will avoid hitting the crane. And the boom must not protrude onto the adjacent lanes where vehicles are free to move at all times.</p>
              <p>3) Did the lorry company station a person as a look-out for any safety lapses when the crane is in operation? Solely depending on the crane operator is not the solution to ensure safety to the public and motorists. </p>
              <p>4) I think SBST and the victims can claim the lorry company's insurance company and it is mandatory for contractors to purchase insurance policies for every project they undertake.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Although I'm not a driver and dont really know the conduct of the tree cutting operators, but I agree the point that the boom should not obstruct any area beyond it's cordoned area so to say, since they are working without road closure at any rate.</p>
              <p>Since there are multiple workers among the tree cutting ops, I thought one of them ought to be a "road martial" who only gotta signal and redirect drivers and maybe need not do other stuff? At any rate, if the crane is lowering, there's a call in advance and that signaller will proceed to control traffic.</p>
              <p>The tree cutting squad has been there before the bus came, so at any rate the tree cutting squad is at more liberty of look out the traffic and do any action like traffic control or pause operation if i may say so. For the BC, even if he stop behind the truck and dont overtake, he might end up blocking the mouth of the zebra crossing and who knows, the boom might swivel into windscreen all the same than a full row swipe as it did.</p>
              <p>In short, the truck is doing stationary work while traffic beside continue to flow, so to say they are at more liberty in controlling the boom and to direct the traffic than a bus who dont really foresee wat is ahead of its road.</p>
              <p>I'm not a pro, pls pardon my ignorance if any and dont flame me if that's so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>i didn't deny. as i've said, "this kind of mathematical calculations" are very simplistic for anyone who wishes to know roughly the magnitude of the impact, but are nowhere near the sophiscation you have purported. i cannot bring this calculation and make my case at the insurance brokers. maybe it's beyond you to actually come up with something as simple as this, so someone has to put up a simple calculation for you.</p>
              <p>now, answer my questions.</p>
