              æ–­ç« å�–ä¹‰... Trying to twist the facts. 
              
              The 8074 incident was triggered because the Habit in front last min try to siam a m'bike during lane filtering. 
              
              Need to say more abt poor speed control? Happy time step on accelerator, see hazard siam go step on heavy brake. 
              
              Of course didn't know did the 8074 BC followed the dist keeping rule... But if it's sudden brake, also cannot siam. 
              
              I guess the cause was bendy too long, SL last min realise the tail too near to m'bike???

              <p>Nonsense. As if.</p>
              <p>Tell me. How many ppl were killed for safety issues in bendies in Singapore. Now tell me. How many ppl were killed due to safety issues of DDs in Singapore. I can recall very vividly the Bedok incident u noe. That's one. I believe there r many more.</p>
              <p>HK cannot shift to SDs is becoz that time it was under ruling of British gvmt, until 1997 when they finally brought in more SDs. But it's becoz of high population and expensive price to do a SD turnover that they stuck with DDs till now. Singapore can switch to bendies u noe. IT'S NOT AS HARD. </p>
              <p>London cannot shift to SDs is becoz of loading conditions, popular demand in buses and also high population. </p>
              <p>I think SBS1000U (and maybe u, who juz spout nonsense in the high loading svc thread) is/are the one(s) siding the DDs, nvr giving the bendies a thought on its pros. I DO give DDs pros too. Otherwise I would hv tore SBS down for sending away my B10MA. </p>

              <p>Seeing your posts make me wonder who's the real RETARD big time.Have u ever drive a bendy or servicing a bendy before?Sg is good for bendies??R u sure?Then how come till now there's not even a single WAB bendy in SMRT fleets after the WAB scheme is introduced 5 years back?Look Im not a bendy hater but with Singapore grewing populations and vehicles growth bendies are not feasible anymore.DDs in heartland got problem ah?Which svc can u list out some?Already there are many examples of SMRT crappy maintenance and bus care evidence.Bendy burnt while on svc,Engine roaring like mad,Stuck gearbox,MAN buses dirty like asshole,Air suspension leak and the bus aren't 1 year yet!If they think bendy is so practical and is part of SMRT icon why dun they at least maintance the engine in good condition?FYI there are many problems with articulator joints,Axles cracked and engine overheat cases particularly Wldep.Technician also complain very complex and troublesome.During TIBS there's less problem with bendy compared to smrt now..It's up for you to believe or not kid but I assure you there will be no bendies in future!</p>
