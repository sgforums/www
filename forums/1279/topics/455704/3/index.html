              <p>It's not about the number (: <strong>It's the quality of maintance.</strong> Buses are made to transport people, not to burnt as and when they like. You said Bendy buses have higher accident rates, true. But if the driver practise safety everytime, I believe that the number would drop.</p>

              <p>that time i was in woodlands regional interchange, noticed one particular habit roaring unusually loud and hoarse when it moved off from the alighting berth</p>
              <p>we all know that bendies are the noisest buses when they accelerate, but for this particular bus, the roar was eeriely deafening with strange squeaking sounds, didn't check out the number plate though</p>
              <p>Have also noticed that even some passengers at the waiting berth and passerbys nearby were alarmed by the usual loud roar and even turned their attentions to this bus for a quick curious glance</p>
              <p>Straightaway i have the premonition telling me something is not right with the engine or other mechanical structures and something bad may happen</p>
              <p>I'm certain that this bus belongs to a woodlands feeder/townlink service cos half an hour later when i returned to the interchange, i chanced on it again, the very same attention-seeking deafening roar when it accelerated ..it's like a plane taking off</p>
              <p>SLs or passengers should play their part to alert the concerned staffs at the interchange if they observe any abnormality or tell-tale signs..from the way the engine sounds, sometimes you can tell something is not right..sometimes SL just bo hiew cos as long as the bus can move, his job is just to drive..</p>

              <p>FIRST it's tree slam into bus upper deck, kill 5. THEN it's signpost attached to building shave the roof of DD and kill 10++. SUBSEQUENTLY it's two DDs ram into each other and fling two upper deck ppl out, making them fall to death. WORST OF ALL is speeding DD at nite flip over while making a turn, two lives gone again juz liddat.</p>
              <p>Seriously. For wat I noe, in safety issue, besides fires I dun think there are any other safety problems wif bendies. Still good for SMRT to utilise WAB bendies in the future. </p>
              <p>Please think abt the cons of DDs next time b4 saying that SMRT will sink becoz of bendies, becoz, who knows, they may sink due to DDs too :D</p>

              <p>Bro, HK is using 98% DDs in its fleet. If there were so many problems with it - it would have shifted to SDs. HK and London have the most efficient bus network and both use maximum DDs - comfortable journey for passengers and at the same time can carry more passengers rather than deploying two buses - hence profitable too.</p>
              <p>So don't shoot nonsense to defend bendy buses - which are the most noisy and inefficient buses in SG today.</p>

              <p>Nonsense. As if.</p>
              <p>Tell me. How many ppl were killed for safety issues in bendies in Singapore. Now tell me. How many ppl were killed due to safety issues of DDs in Singapore. I can recall very vividly the Bedok incident u noe. That's one. I believe there r many more.</p>
              <p>HK cannot shift to SDs is becoz that time it was under ruling of British gvmt, until 1997 when they finally brought in more SDs. But it's becoz of high population and expensive price to do a SD turnover that they stuck with DDs till now. Singapore can switch to bendies u noe. IT'S NOT AS HARD. </p>
              <p>London cannot shift to SDs is becoz of loading conditions, popular demand in buses and also high population. </p>
              <p>I think SBS1000U (and maybe u, who juz spout nonsense in the high loading svc thread) is/are the one(s) siding the DDs, nvr giving the bendies a thought on its pros. I DO give DDs pros too. Otherwise I would hv tore SBS down for sending away my B10MA. </p>

              <p>Yah exactly. Even though KMB is still bringing in new DDs, I hv nvr seen them introducing SDs at such a fast rate these years u noe. Perhaps they are starting to utilise buses properly oredi.</p>
