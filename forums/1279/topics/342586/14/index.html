              <p>Yes, you are correct. At least 85% of all basic services (including feeder services) need to comply with the 10 minutes headway during both peak hours. On top of this, another standard requires at least 90% of feeder services to comply with the 10 minutes headway during both peak hours, which mean feeder services which do not comply will also form part of the 15% in the first standard.</p>
              <p>Actually I do not think that both companies are able to comply with these standards. On the actual ground, even at the interchange, do the services actually come within 10 minutes during both peak hours? I guess not, judging from the complaints.</p>
