              <p><strong>Renewed calls for public transport subsidies for the disabled</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's disabled can now travel on buses more
              conveniently as SBS Transit rolls out eight new wheelchair accessible
              bus services to commemorate World Disability Day on Thursday.
              <br> <br> The services are numbers 13, 15, 36, 52, 54, 57, 291 and 333.
              <br> <br> The move will bring the total number of wheelchair accessible bus (WAB) services introduced this year to 16.
              <br> <br> In total, SBS Transit will have 38 WAB services running on the roads.
              <br> <br> It said ridership on its services by passengers-in-wheelchairs has increased steadily.
              <br> <br>In November, close to 1,000 trips were made by
              passengers-in-wheelchairs on 30 wheelchair accessible bus services, and
              the company said it is expecting the numbers to grow as more WAB
              services continue to be rolled out.
              <br> <br>A passenger who benefits from the WAB services is Hong Kai Siong,
              who suffered a stroke three years ago. His family said they are happy
              the service is affordable.
              <br> <br>"Taking taxi is very expensive, I find taking bus is very
              convenient, said Mabel Tan, his caregiver. "(We) will take buses that
              have handicap logo."
              <br> <br>However, disability group "CAN!" said providing such accessibility
              is not enough, and members are renewing calls for public transport
              subsidies for the disabled as they say not everyone can afford the
              fares.
              <br> <br>Its coordinator Reena Rajeswari, who is visually impaired, has been
              pushing for transport subsidies for a decade now, so that the disabled
              community can travel without financial worries.
              <br> <br>"I realise there are many disabled people who are not willing to
              come out because of insufficient funds for transport," she said.
              <br> <br> The group held a two-week campaign to petition for their cause in May.
              <br> <br>Nearly 400 signatures were collected but the group claimed it has
              not been easy to hand over the petition to the relevant authorities.
              <br> <br> CAN! said it will continue to petition for a subsidy similar to that given to senior citizens, but without the restricted hours.
              <br> <br>When contacted, the Public Transport Council said it does not
              administer any form of subsidy, but both SBS Transit and SMRT said they
              are exploring the possibility of concessionary travel for the disabled.
              <br> <br>SMRT said that any concessionary travel is effectively
              cross-subsidised by full-fare paying commuters. Hence, there is a need
              to exercise prudence in granting travel concessions.
              <br> <br> The public has been mostly receptive of the idea of subsidised fares for the disabled.
              <br> <br>"There should be some benefits for them, looking at circumstances,
              some of them don't work, they canâ€™t get work," said a commuter. "People
              need to be educated, like in England, you actually have a disabled
              badge and only those people get free access on the public transport and
              on MRT... and even free parking."
              <br> <br>"I believe there should not be subsidies but more so giving them
              facilities to help them get around conveniently," said another member
              of the public.
              <br> <br>The Public Transport Council said there are agencies which provide
              transport help, specifically for the disabled to get around
              conveniently.
              <br> <br>The National Council of Social Service, for example, administers
              the Land Transport Authority's Cares Fund, which provides
              reimbursements to disabled persons for journeys to-and-fro home for
              employment or schooling purposes. </span></p>

              <p>What's the point of putting a sign with just a number in either red or white for services with KUBs (currently, only svc 60)? Regular commuters might be used to using colours to tell where the bus is going, but not for commuters who just happen to be visiting the area.</p>

              <p>The problem is those idiots in SBST don't seem to be able to get a proper EDS done. They should have continued on with the format Tridents are using right now instead of using an insipid arrow in front and having the side desto showing a cycle which non-regular passengers wouldn't know how it starts or end, especially for the feeders.</p>

              <p><strong>MediaCorp to discontinue TV Mobile from next year:</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: MediaCorp will discontinue TV Mobile, the free-to-air mobile digital television broadcast service, next year.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp said in a statement released on Tuesday that it has decided
              to terminate the service upon expiry of its current agreement with SBS
              Transit on January 1.
              <br> <br>The company said the discontinuation comes after a careful
              evaluation of the viability of the service, as resources required to
              operate and maintain TV Mobile are substantial.
              <br> <br> When the service was launched in 2001, it was the only platform in Singapore that offered digital content to public commuters.
              <br> <br> MediaCorp said it will re-deploy all TV Mobile staff to other operations within the company.

              <p>Come Sunday, 27 December 2009, residents living in Boon Lay will be able to wait for buses in air-conditioned comfort.</p>
              <p>The Boon Lay Interchange, which is situated along Jurong West Central 3, will open its doors to commuters this weekend. Integrated with the Jurong Point retail mall, the new facility will take commuting to a whole new level as residents can shop, dine and hop on a bus under one roof!</p>
              <p>Located a stoneâ€™s throw away from the current interchange, the new facility will also rank as Singaporeâ€™s busiest interchange â€“ with 30 bus services operating from its berths. Three services â€“ Services 179, 179A and 199 â€“ will continue to run from the current interchange for the time being due to their heavy passenger volumes. They will gradually be moved to the new interchange.</p>
              <p>At its full capacity, this new 20,000 square metres Boon Lay bus interchange â€“ which is the largest air-conditioned interchange â€“ is expected to have an average daily passenger boarding of 55,000 on weekdays.</p>
              <p>Similar to the first three air-conditioned bus interchanges in Toa Payoh, Sengkang and Ang Mo Kio, the new Boon Lay bus interchange is also equipped with automatic sliding doors for the convenience and safety of passengers.</p>
              <p>To optimise traffic flow within the interchange and along peripheral roads, the 30 bus services have been carefully allocated to their respective berths. SBS Transitâ€™s bus services calling at Berths 1 to 6 will make a left turn when exiting from the interchange and on their return journey, conduct a right turn entry into the interchange. On the other hand, services serving Berths 7 to 17 will perform a right turn when leaving the interchange and on their return, make a left turn entry into the interchange.</p>
              <p>As a result of this, the routes of eight services â€“ Services 182, 182M, 194, 199, 240, 242, 254 and 405 â€“ will be amended with some of these services calling at additional bus stops and by passing others along the amended routes. Due to the close proximity to the new interchange, the bus stop along Jurong West Central 3 (Bus Stop 22581, opposite Jurong Point) will be removed and seven services â€“ Services 157, 174, 174e, 198, 199, 242 and 405 â€“ will cease to stop there with effect from Sunday, 27 December 2009.</p>
              <p>With the opening of this new interchange, additional staff will be deployed in the first few days of operation to assist passengers.<br><br><a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/NR_New_BL_Bus_Interchange.pdf">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/NR_New_BL_Bus_Interchange.pdf</a></p>
