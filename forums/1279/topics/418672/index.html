              <p>They will never paint the full picture and they do not want to too... haiz.</p>
              <p>What do they mean by "adding more bus trips during peak hours"? Never mention how they going to do it. Adding more buses is fine, but if they do re-scheduling, I rather they don't add any bus trips cos non-peak trips will be compromised.</p>

              <p><br>For SBS's terminology it's usually additional S Shift. Unless stated it's ADD replacing SD.</p>
              <p>For 180, I'm pretty sure there's no effect. The additional buses effect all tio makan by scheduling issues. So far alrdy has been brunching for 180 heading to BPJ as early as at Lakeside.</p>

              <p>As a resident "upstream", I wish to preserve 119 as it is than to go into ave 7 so that it can serve the "hotspots" like Hougang plaza and the schools along Upp S'goon road, although I admit the reality that 136 is the preferred choice for obvious reasons. </p>
              <p>I would say since 119 sort of similar route to 112 (as in cover Kovan), the ave 7 folks wont appreciate its presence and in holistic view, only pax like students of schools in Sengkang will benefit than the majority. Now ave 7 with only 112 is relatively "cold" esp the side along the river, unless you're bringing a route like 80 along there, if not it ain't so much change. </p>

              <p><br>I've always appreciated the fact that 88 usually leaves the int on time. And the BCs drive at ok speeds. And the night-time frequency is still tolerable.</p>
              <p>72 is not.</p>
              <p>72 is almost always late on departure, and the BCs take their own sweet time. Because its been so many years already, its obvious that its the schedule that needs some tweaking. The bus can drive at fantasically slow speeds along PLAB stretch and the bus can still be considered early.</p>
              <p>But ok. Because its night, my standards have to be lowered. But 72's loading is more jialat than 88 at YCK, Tampines, and Hougang Int. And a significant portion of the people who take 88 from AMK to get to HG can take a number of other buses as well. 72 doesnt have much viable alternatives from Tampines to HG, which does make me extremely fed up and pissed at times.</p>
              <p>Last time, 2 lines beyond the railings at Tampines = sibei jialat, now its considered extremely normal.</p>

              <p><br>I still remember SBST re-introducing service 119 due to the complains which were made by Sengkang residents regarding the loss of link along Rivervale areas after the withdrawal of former service 85 (Sengkang - Harbourfront).</p>
              <p>But true enough service 119 really suffered a number of downgrades over this 2 years. Firstly the 2 ADDs were removed and replaced by the Volvo MK4s. It even lost one of the 2 Scania K230UB perms (SBS8491P) when service 113 went WAB in Feb this year.</p>
