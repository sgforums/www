                              <p>copy over for reference so that everybody can see, for TIB868X,
              SBS899A, who are the active combatants who were involved in
              attacking the other party.</p>
              
              <p>SBS7485P, why is the apology <em>only</em> now and not
              much much earlier to the lot of the guys who were affected? It's
              apparently 3 years from what i gathered off the investigating. 3
              years to realise that what you've done indirectly harmed the hobby
              and people whom were affected? You indirectly created enemies for
              one party in the past with your spur of the moment actins and now
              you wash your hands off? <br>
              <br>
              Boycotting due to phtoography of buses. Whether true or not, i
              don't care but whoever who's intiating boycotts is pretty much
              chidlish to the core. Stupidly throwing them aside instead of
              respecting each and every photographer's unique abilities, forcing
              everybody to follow one fucking "standard". Later people became
              more successful in photos then realise you screwed up.<br>
              <br>
              Both parties are at fault. At the spur of the moment. Harsh things.
              By finger pointing at one party, then badmouthing and causing the
              intial chaos because of defensive actions after the incident? Not
              to mention, your party did wrong, not respecting the company and
              degrading the hobby with that kind of usage. Why was the blame and
              claim of sabotage even exist? Then people hate that one party
              because of the belief he sabotaged the hobby, this already formed
              the basis of the hate that you are indirectly responsible for,
              SBS7485P.<br>
              <br>
              All things have a chain effect. One party attack, the other party
              defend. Then the bigger party not happy still, brainwash people to
              boycott and dislike the smaller party, slowly eroding the support
              and friends away so as a way to gain back the support? Then slowly
              become a war.<br>
              <br>
              Not to mention slowly a biasedness grow out and then causing more
              chaos because of the intial chaos. Honestly, I didn't see the point
              why people target here and there. Then create more conflicts.Then
              people get divided into more camps and from what i see, the person
              who was targetted actually lost his friends becaue of the "spur of
              the moment" actions.<br>
              <br>
              And what is with those clone accounts happening that kept copying
              that party's facebook page content and posting it with nonsenical
              claim? Then later start to victimise that party's page and then
              later start to target his friends around him? What the fuck
              for?<br>
              <br>
              Was these hate and anger even necessary? Was there benefit to
              attack and badmouth? Was retaliation neccessary? Wasn't it better
              to leave the party alone and do your own fucking things in the
              first place? End up today everybody hate, target and anger, and
              create all these bullshit. For what fuck?<br>
              <br>
              I gathered that the party is seeing a doctor as well, and I do not
              see the point as well why people want to bring up his medical and
              life situation and badmouth as well, repeatedly. There's a limit to
              bullying as well, and i agree with many others, it has crossed the
              line. Not surprised why the other party retaliated as well. Even
              you don't respect people, respect the medical and life situation,
              STUPID, by leaving it out of the politics! <br>

              <p>copy over for reference so that everybody can see, for TIB868X,
              SBS899A<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(?????????????????)</strong></span>, who are the active combatants who were involved in
              attacking the other party.</p>
              <p>SBS7485P, why is the apology <em>only</em> now and not
              much much earlier to the lot of the guys who were affected? It's
              apparently 3 years from what i gathered off the investigating. 3
              years to realise that what you've done indirectly harmed the hobby
              and people whom were affected? You indirectly created enemies for
              one party in the past with your spur of the moment actins and now
              you wash your hands off? <br> <br> Boycotting due to phtoography of buses. Whether true or not, i
              don't care but whoever who's intiating boycotts is pretty much
              chidlish to the core. Stupidly throwing them aside instead of
              respecting each and every photographer's unique abilities, forcing
              everybody to follow one fucking "standard". Later people became
              more successful in photos then realise you screwed up.<br> <br> Both parties are at fault. At the spur of the moment. Harsh things.
              By finger pointing at one party, then badmouthing and causing the
              intial chaos because of defensive actions after the incident? Not
              to mention, your party did wrong, not respecting the company and
              degrading the hobby with that kind of usage. Why was the blame and
              claim of sabotage even exist? Then people hate that one party
              because of the belief he sabotaged the hobby, this already formed
              the basis of the hate that you are indirectly responsible for,
              SBS7485P.<br> <br> All things have a chain effect. One party attack, the other party
              defend. Then the bigger party not happy still, brainwash people to
              boycott and dislike the smaller party, slowly eroding the support
              and friends away so as a way to gain back the support? Then slowly
              become a war.<br> <br> Not to mention slowly a biasedness grow out and then causing more
              chaos because of the intial chaos. Honestly, I didn't see the point
              why people target here and there. Then create more conflicts.Then
              people get divided into more camps and from what i see, the person
              who was targetted actually lost his friends becaue of the "spur of
              the moment" actions.<br> <br> And what is with those clone accounts happening that kept copying
              that party's facebook page content and posting it with nonsenical
              claim? Then later start to victimise that party's page and then
              later start to target his friends around him? What the fuck
              for?<br> <br> Was these hate and anger even necessary? Was there benefit to
              attack and badmouth? Was retaliation neccessary? Wasn't it better
              to leave the party alone and do your own fucking things in the
              first place? End up today everybody hate, target and anger, and
              create all these bullshit. For what fuck?<br> <br> I gathered that the party is seeing a doctor as well, and I do not
              see the point as well why people want to bring up his medical and
              life situation and badmouth as well, repeatedly. There's a limit to
              bullying as well, and i agree with many others, it has crossed the
              line. Not surprised why the other party retaliated as well. Even
              you don't respect people, respect the medical and life situation,
              STUPID, by leaving it out of the politics! <br> <br> <br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">All of you who had participated
              have to make amends and work things out each other. GO and
              think.<br> <br> brainless group of youths, do actions don't think of
              consequences. </span></p>
