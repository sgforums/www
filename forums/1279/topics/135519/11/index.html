            <div class='col-md body'>This morning, I boarded one bus which had faulty ticketing systems. Even the bell was out of order. It was a free ride. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today took Sv 262 (SBS3883A) from Ang Mo Kio Int, waited 20 minutes! While in the bus, I was trying to alight at the bus stop outside AMK MRT Station. When I pressed the BUS STOPPING bell, she (BC) refused to open the EXIT door. So maybe I think she didn't notice that I intended to alight there, then the BC proceeded to another bus stop outside Blk 422 and finally opened the EXIT gate and allowed me to alight.<br><br>Later on, I had to cross the road to get back to AMK MRT Station.</div>
