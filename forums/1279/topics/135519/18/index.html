            <div class='col-md body'>Two unusual happenings on buses...<br><br>1. <strong>TIB 0779U</strong> made three crazy rounds about the bus park at Bedok North Bus Interchange just now due to the lack of parking. Worse still, the bus mounted kerb when it finally came out of the bus park! I saw it at about 1358hrs at Bedok North Bus Interchange.<br><br>2. Two unusual occurences on <strong>SBS 2990E</strong>.<br><br>1. A big family of Malays (about 10 of them) boarded the bus just before it was about to turn out of the bus stop and onto Bedok Reservior Road. They were quite noisy and blocking the passageways which attracted not only my attention, but also other people's attention.<br><br>2. The engine of the bus suddenly went dead before it was turning out of the bus stop opposite Block 745 of Bedok Reservior Road. Anxious of getting the breakdown ticket, I made quite a scene by running from the middle of the bus to the front to see what happened. But the BC managed to restart the engine soon after.</div>

That's why I said I am normally quite impatient with a lot of things.</div>

[b]TIB 0779U</strong> made three crazy rounds about the bus park at Bedok North Bus Interchange just now due to the lack of parking. Worse still, the bus mounted kerb when it finally came out of the bus park! I saw it at about 1358hrs at Bedok North Bus Interchange.<br><br>2. Two unusual occurences on <strong>SBS 2990E</strong>.<br><br>1. A big family of Malays (about 10 of them) boarded the bus just before it was about to turn out of the bus stop and onto Bedok Reservior Road. They were quite noisy and blocking the passageways which attracted not only my attention, but also other people's attention.<br><br>2. The engine of the bus suddenly went dead before it was turning out of the bus stop opposite Block 745 of Bedok Reservior Road. Anxious of getting the breakdown ticket, I made quite a scene by running from the middle of the bus to the front to see what happened. But the BC managed to restart the engine soon after.[/b]</blockquote>1 - I dont find it unusual.. Itz normal for buses to go round the interchange for  a few times before they can find a parking lot. It is not surprising to me when Bedok Interchange so much Services that it could actually can. I think you shld try to venture out of Bedok.. Wait till you see Hougang and BoonLay.<br><br>2 - Unusual ? no comments. A bus is not a library.. Dont expect people to board the bus and keep quiet. I'm sure you as a student, when boarding a bus with a group of friends will keep your volume down.<br><br>3 - Kinda normal to me.. Wait till you try a CNG which stalled in the middle of Pan-Island Expressway. And for god's sake, do behave yourself. Engine Stalled doesnt mean that there is a breakdown.</div>
