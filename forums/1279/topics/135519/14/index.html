Passengers they dont like very much, (because they dont get paid for having more passengers), and its a "waste of time" and well, many are malaysians.. notorious for _____.<br><br>i dont know what to say sometimes.. its normal to see some SMRT svxx, 3 come together, then if u miss the triplet, gota wait 30mins..<br><br>still, they make your journey time shorter sometimes</div>
