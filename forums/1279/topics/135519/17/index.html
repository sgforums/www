            <div class='col-md body'>That is why you are advised to state your fare when paying cash. It saves time from counting the coins. Some BCs will simply ask how much you put in. At the bottom of the farebox window, the gap between the screen and the trap door is just wide enough for the coins to allow them to spread out in a line. It takes experience to count the fare quickly and correctly. Now with EZ-Link is not so bad. Last time in the OTS era, boarding a bus could take a while..</div>

When both buses arrived outside the Post Office (the last stop before heading for the interchange), there was quite some delay for both of the buses. The BC on my bus horned the bus in front, the the bus reversed. When I turned to look at what happened to SBS 2717D, guess what I saw?<br><br>A ruckus between two passengers and the BC!<br><br>Wow, I almost had a close shave. It is because I was smart. I chose to take buses I never took before, not buses I had gotten onto before. This should be thanks to a USSW (Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Writing, similar to the diary/journal you had written before) I wrote last Wednesday, where I was being asked in an entry whether I chose to be smart or lucky.

The bus in front of me was SBS 2717D of Service 69. When both buses arrived outside the Post Office (the last stop before heading for the interchange), there was quite some delay for both of the buses. The BC on my bus horned the bus in front, the the bus reversed. When I turned to look at what happened to SBS 2717D, guess what I saw?<br><br>A ruckus between two passengers and the BC!<br><br>Wow, I almost had a close shave. It is because I was smart. I chose to take buses I never took before, not buses I had gotten onto before. This should be thanks to a USSW (Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Writing, similar to the diary/journal you had written before) I wrote last Wednesday, where I was being asked in an entry whether I chose to be smart or lucky. I wrote that I chose to be smart and here it goes, luckiness eventually.</div></blockquote>what logic are you talking?</div>
