            <div class='col-md body'>It's some sort of air suspension thingy. When I played vBus, I pressed the 'F' button and look, thr bus tilted the same way as the Volvo Olympian did. Well, same problem also goes to the SMRT Nissan OACs. They had a big titlting problem NOT caused by air suspension.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was on SMRT Service 966. After about 10mins in the bus, the window latch near seat I was sitting suddenly starts to vibrate when not moving and the bus engine was super noisy...its was as if I was at a construction site. I had to blast my music and hold on to the latch to "absorb" the vibration so that it was less noisy. It was a 50 min ride so every traffic light I had to rest my hand as it was very tired...the latch was vibrating like as if there was a strong tremor...<br><br>At one particular area, there was bad traffic at Eunos and I had to wait for 3 traffic lights before the bus started to move...by the time i reached home, I was damn super tired...i was fasting also sia...<br><br></div>
