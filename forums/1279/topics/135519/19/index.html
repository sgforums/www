            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by TWS4793:<br>Two unusual happenings on buses...<br><br>1. <strong>TIB 0779U</strong> made three crazy rounds about the bus park at Bedok North Bus Interchange just now due to the lack of parking. Worse still, the bus mounted kerb when it finally came out of the bus park! I saw it at about 1358hrs at Bedok North Bus Interchange.<br><br>2. Two unusual occurences on <strong>SBS 2990E</strong>.<br><br>1. A big family of Malays (about 10 of them) boarded the bus just before it was about to turn out of the bus stop and onto Bedok Reservior Road. They were quite noisy and blocking the passageways which attracted not only my attention, but also other people's attention.<br><br>2. The engine of the bus suddenly went dead before it was turning out of the bus stop opposite Block 745 of Bedok Reservior Road. Anxious of getting the breakdown ticket, I made quite a scene by running from the middle of the bus to the front to see what happened. But the BC managed to restart the engine soon after.</blockquote>1. yeah see boon lay in the mornings and evening peak hrs.<br><br>2.1. the biggest group wins.<br><br>2.2. wow a lot of breakdowns at the driving centres then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two unusual happenings on the bus today:<br><br>1. I just got onto TIB 0944J on Service 67. Then there was another passenger who got up on the same bus. Guess what happened next?<br><br>The bus driver punched (not too hard nor too soft) the man's elbow (that man who got up the bus behind me). Then he turned around and thought I comitted the act, but I denied. Then he said, "You'll be my witness arh, which school you come from? Arh, <span style="color: red;">CENSORED</span> Secondary School. I hold you as witness arh..." After that, the bus driver punched him again and then they settled down to have a friendly talk in Malay.<br><br>2. I was on board SBS 3721J on Service 225W. The bus arrived outside Yu Neng Primary School and some students got onto the bus. Little did anyone know that the BC closed the doors without knowing that one boy was trying to 'attack' another student and his hand almost got caught between the exit doors. His friends (and me) were surprised, and the 'victim' said that he felt something rubbery closing on his wrist (not the exact statement that he said).</div>
