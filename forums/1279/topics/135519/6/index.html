All the bus service serving along that road was being affected. For eg Sv 119 the BC told me that he was late for 20 mins. The traffic was crawling very slowly <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Sv 81 had buses coming one and the other and etc. I saw three fire engines on that road too think maybe there was accident happened  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Does anyone saw that too and maybe can clarify that???

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this time when I encountered immigration offenders taking the same express bus as I. Two Banglas were with me on the bus from KL to Singapore. We stopped at JB customs for clearance. Most of the passengers passed through without a hitch and returned to the bus. Still no sign of those 2 buggers. After nearly an hour, they emerged, escorted by an immigration officer. My guess is that they were overstayers and were let off with a fine after being questioned by the authorities.</div>

Later, he asked me to come and not to remove tickets and to move around in the bus as it is dangerous. Not so kind to give me tickets anyway.<br><br>TIB991Y (302): When the driver saw me doing the same thing, he gave me all the tickets in a cup and to empty it. Instead, I kept it secretly in my pocket. Then, I returned the empty cup to the driver.<br><br>TIB1170T (187): I went down on the steps to retrieve the tickets.

So she asked me to go and check whether is it a not. Then found out it was belong to the contractor one who are doing some works at the Interchange.<br>She thought the suspicious package belonged to a student one which he/she carried too much until foregt to carry that. She thought that he/she was too depressed on studying<br>We board the same bus Sv 119, SBS2666S<br>On the bus she told me about the exams thing and say the overall percentage pass and so on<br>She also told me that time she took 86 and after she board, the BC swerved the bus to the right and she lost control and was running down luckily never injured. She scold the BC on it but the BC said that it was her fault saying that he cannot see her in the mirror and it was her bad luck. WT..............<br>After that a mother and two kids board the bus the two child was mischiveous, playing the handle, climbing the bar, sleep on the seat and so on.... The mother was angry and scolded him. That aunty also reprimanded him too. After that they behaved. Having all this incidents in the bus, the BC<br>still looked normal and calmed<br><br>PS: My Language is poor so may have some broken english. Apologise for that</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today, on Svc 67, when TIB599Y goes to Serangoon Rd, the buses becomes full-load. At least I got a seat when I board it at CCK Int. Later, when the bus stops at Lavender St, the bus driver told all standing passengers to move to the rear (not like 307, students do not co-operate). At one bus stop at Serangoon Rd, one man quickly ran to catch Svc 67.<br><br>One driver of SBS522L of Svc 25, asked me to show my Bus Concession Pass as I am paying cash for the bus fare. The bus driver wanted to verify the identity of the Student Identification Pass before enjoying the 55Â¢ fare. If I don't show to the driver, I will have to pay adult fare, 90Â¢.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mixed feelings 3 days ago.<br><br>Was waiting for the 0700 trident on 89 as usual, when I saw this old man wearing school shoes and dressed in tattered clothes enter bus-stop. The trident arrived as usual, and the old man kan chiong, literally chiong up the bus. BC yelled at him bcos he never pay. He yelled again: " OI, uncle!". But the old man just carried on up the stairs shaking his head at BC. His face was woebegone and he looked like he's gonna cry. Did not see what happened when he left though........BC apparently let him off.</div>
