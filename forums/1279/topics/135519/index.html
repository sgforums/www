(he carried a bag but no one else knows what's inside) and he said he cannot afford to pay the fare as he is poor. However the BC insisted that he pay as this was unfair to other passengers. In the end the man had no money to pay the fare, the BC had no choice and let him alight at Circuit Rd outside the food centre, I presume that the man was going to sell the tissue papers ? there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Then this cranky lunatic guy boarded the bus at the IMM bus stop, and he happened to sit beside this unfortunate auntie.
