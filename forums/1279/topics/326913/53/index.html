              <p><br> If you have nothing much to say, please keep your mouth shut. You
                  are being childish and behaving like an idiot here.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you are very rude to spout rubbish to other people's
                  questions. The question had already ask "which SBST services that
                  ply between the two areas". I don't think person opening the
                  question is being biased on whichever company or whatever but
                  testing the members here on their knowledge on their SBST services
                  between places. And I am jolly well in a better serviced SBST bus
                  rather than in a smelly, dusty and insect and algae infested SMRT
                  bus. At least I won't feel shortcharged.</p>
              <p>And this is a bus forum, not a train forum. Moreover this is a
                  thread with questions testing bus fans' knowledge, not one
                  that asking for directions. The type of answers you give simply
                  tells us your level of stupidity and ignorance. YOU ARE A DISGRACE
                  TO THE COMMUNITY HERE. </p>
              <p>Secondly, you are not showing respect to the person opening the
                  question by answering irrelevant answers to him. If you are not
                  happy with the question, you can jolly well ignore the question and
                  don't answer the question at all. Rather than showing disrespect to
                  the person opening the question and spouting nonsense.</p>
              <p>On the side track, I should say that stop all these mindless
                  bickering in this forum. Most of you are behaving very childish
                  with all those mindless bickerings about many things, from
                  photograph taking to KUB vs OCs to which depot is better, etc. And
                  all these useless bickering can go up in pages and pages and day
                  after days.</p>
              <p>And I am even more surprised and pissed that you people here can
                  judge a bus company based on the type of buses they buy, and not
                  the level of service they should and had provided. This shows the
                  level of understanding of bus operations and commuters' needs here.
                  Pardon me for being straightforward, but some of you people
                  judgments here is downright silly and childish. It shows that you
                  people don't know what are public bus service for basically.</p>
              <p>The answer that Mr SBS n SMRT shows you people an example the
                  level of this forum. Lousy, childish and uninformative most of the
                  times. I am surprised that the moderators do not rebutt all these
                  stupid behaviors. IMHO, this is the worst bus forum I had ever come
                  across. I hardly seen such kind of silly behaviors in other forums,
                  be it buses or whatever hobbies. Even Hong Kong bus forums are way
                  much better than this forum. Why can't you people post some
                  informative comments, amid of some jokes rather than silly comments
                  on who is better than who, what is better than what and complain
                  about the slightest silly things???</p>
              <p>Please stop all these nonsense in this forum and show some
                  respect to this hobby and my friend who is the creator for this
                  forum. He takes up so much time and effort to build up this forum
                  so as to allow people here to share knowledge and exchange ideas
                  about Singapore buses. And YOU people just come here and spout
                  nonsense, create mindless arguements, and showing your mindless and
                  childish thoughts here. Moreover, you people are creating so much
                  trouble in the public as well. Making a nuisence in public buses,
                  illegal or/and dangerous phototaking of buses, which gives a very
                  bad impression to the public about bus fans here.  </p>
              <p>If you people want to joyride in buses, please stop all your
                  nonsense in the public. Don't ever treat the public bus as a
                  playground. You are disrupting the smooth operations of bus
                  companies, endangering the lives of other commuters, the driver and
                  yourself. You are also taking a risk of jeopardising the ricebowl
                  of our bus captains. Stop all those actions like running up and
                  down the bus aisle, blocking the path of commuters, making so much
                  noises in the public bus, hogging seats, talking to bus captains
                  and blocking the way at the front aisle. And stop scouting in bus
                  depots and take the risk to anyhow take pictures in depots and bus
                  interchanges. Mind you, all of you, you all are creating a very bad
                  image to the authorities and the public here.</p>
              <p>And don't ask me who is the creator. The moderators themselves
                  will know.</p>
              <p>I should end here. If you poeple are not happy with what I've
                  said, then too bad for you people because I am just stating a fact
                  as an audience for this forum for so many months. If you think that
                  I am being unreasonable here, maybe you people should reflect on
                  your behavior in the forum and the public as well. I have seen and
                  heard some of the members' negative behaviors in the forum and in
                  the public. You people better stop your nonsense and behave more
                  maturely. I don't want to see any rubbish going on here or any
                  complaints from my friend.</p>
