              <p>I would classify it as part of an expressway since it literally runs parallel to it. It's just how different people perceive different things. No one's right, nor anyone's wrong.</p>

              <p>If one were to look at the Singapore Map, PIE "ends" at Eunos Flyover, which is then preceded by Paya Lebar Way, then Jln Kolam Ayer where the KPE entrance/exit is, then Jalan Toa Payoh, where thereafter it is the PIE again.</p>
              <p>The names were merely kept for whatever reasons they were, but they are, nevertheless, they are on the same stretch, running parallel (be it the slip roads by the side where the bus stops are, or the middle portion of the stretch where cars are allowed to travel thru without exiting).</p>

              <p>Q3 should include Sv 197/33/14 - use AYE. There are part of the route which is NOT parellel to AYE. It DOES travel on AYE. Likewise for Sv 26. It does travel on PIE towards direction of Bedok.. Can also add in Sv 24 , since you say service in bedok, not bedok interchange.</p>
