                      wasn't anything known as sgwiki.</p>

              <p>Are you jealous that I could recall even without sgwiki? Is there a need to boast about the 'seniors'? I know you're one too, and please it was an educated guess that you're an adult. Oh so you mean you travelled from east to west since 5 years old? And yes I'm new, so what? This is a forum for heaven's sake, and you start going around flaming people who talk about the east. How about no one talks about the east from now, and we will not know anything about the east anymore. One more thing, you did not say you were a dictator, I said you were LIKE a dictator, it's my point of view. Why stress about the dictator point? Unless you already know that people are calling you that.<br><br>And with that please can we stop here. Anything else u wanna settle do it in pm.</p>

              <p>If I were to read the two sentences, I won't even need to infer, its just a direct sentence. In case you don't understand what an inference question in English comprehension wants, it is simply a question asking you to interpret a vague sentence. Which I did so for "Guess what? I hate liars, i really do. =) Try to please me with
