            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is an alternative type of topic to the 'Your Favourite Buses' topic.<br><br>Last time, I used to hate this bus which was serving for service 225G at that time. I think it was probably SBS 3685E, the one with a 'Denso Sparkplug' ad on it's rear at that time. It's engine turned out to be the loudest roar.<br><br>Now, I basically hate buses which are Volvo B10M Mkll buses with Walter Alexander bodies. Theirs was round-in fact, totally round-a design which I hate. It's interior was even worse. There's no glass pane behind the driver's seat. Everything around you looked old and antique. Some collected dust too.<br><br>I got onto SBS 1746B and SBS 1772A before. They are buses which match the description above. Their engine roar was bad and I simply disliked it. The outside was ugly looking. The radiator was so big.<br><br>To round up, it just doesn't get any better than all.<br><br>Others simply disliked Nissan's bad-looking body, interior and works. What's yours?</div>
