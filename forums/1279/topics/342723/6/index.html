              <p><br>wat are you trying to drive at? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> ask yourself do you see a car braking down to 40kph from 70 - 80kph when approaching a traffic light junction along a semi highway eps on e right lane? even do you see SBS buses purposely go brake when approaching traffic light?</p>
              <p>e most is let go of 'oil' and slow down and prepare to halt as approaching e junction.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Monday 02 Feb<br><br></strong>Not bus accident, not bus breakdown, but a traffic incident caused at least 17 SBST buses to be delayed and other buses diverted.<br><br>In summary:<br>At around 6.55 pm, a truck pulling a trailer with container stalled at the junction of West Coast Rd, Clementi Ave 2 and Clementi West St 2. The truck (XB 9378 G) was turning right from Clementi Ave 2 middle lane to West Coast Rd, the truck stalled and together with the trailer, blocked the entire 2 lanes of West Coast Rd towards Jln Buroh, vehicles coming from West Coast Plaza area cannot passed thru, but vehicles from Clementi Ave 2 can still managed to turn right to West Coast Rd or travel straight to Clementi West St 2. At least 17 SBST buses cannot passed thru the junction and were delayed as a result. 2 police cars and 1 TP bike were at the scene. The trailer was later connected to another truck which came to the rescue. Traffic started to clear an hour later.<br><br>Affected bus services were 30, 51 and 143 in the direction of Jurong East / Boon Lay. Services 78, 175, 189, 282 and 285 were not affected as they still can managed to pass thru.<br><br>The 17 buses delayed in order (from front to back) during the one hour were:<br>143: SBS 7460 K (SL 143)<br>143: SBS 2996 P (SL 143 / 93) Un-confirmed, it was on the middle lane next to SBS 7460 K. Figured out the rego based on the advert.<br>51: SBS 2598 E (SL SP)<br>143: SBS 7480 C (SL 143)<br>30: SBS 9312 S (BN 30)<br>51: SBS 7377 T (SL 51)<br>143: SBS 9083 C (BR 8)<br>30: SBS 9023 B (SL 30)<br>51: SBS 9165 A (SL 51)<br>143: SBS 2997 L (SL 143 / 93)<br>30: SBS 9048 E (SL 30)<br>51: SBS 7396 M (SL 51)<br>143: SBS 198 P (BR SP)<br>30: SBS 9285 L (SL SP)<br>143: SBS 7456 Z (SL 143)<br>143: SBS 9000 S (SL 143)<br>51: SBS 7394 T (SL 51)<br><br>Just after traffic started to clear, saw a un-identified strider with passengers on service 30 along Clementi Ave 2, suspected it was diverted via Clementi Rd, AYE, Clementi Ave 2.</p></div>

Despite the China SL tried to press a few times, it still didn't work (EDS remained as the photo below), and the SL use the palm of his hand and bang/hit the screen for the EDS controller for a few times. (Just because of a pax who told him about the EDS problem, it caused this thing to happen) After which, he contacted the "OCC" using the communication device beside the SL's seat, and after explanation from him, the "OCC" guy called him to continue that full trip first, and upon reaching back Bt Panjang Int, then report this EDS problem again. In the end, he still insisted to heed the "OCC" guy's advice and keep pressing the EDS controller + walk out of the bus to check the front EDS (side EDS not a problem as it displayed "975" as usual). This made a few passengers who can't tolerate it to walk out of the bus and take the Service 190 bus behind. In the end, he declared breakdown and cancel the trip for the remaining of us (A lady, my mum and myself) who were still inside the bus.</span></p>

There was a mechanic who opened the rear cover and the BC and him checked the bus. They were spraying water on the engine as well when i left on SBS2888T</p>
