              <p><br> All franchised buses in Hong Kong have "speed limiter". Since the

              usually set between 68 and 75.</p>

              <p><span class="style13">The Transport Department says it has asked bus companies to review their rostering systems to make sure drivers have enough time to rest. This comes after it was found that the driver involved in Tuesday's fatal accident in Tseung Kwan O was substituting a shift for a route that he didn't normally drive. Assistant commissioner for transport, Albert Yuen said bus companies can apply to extend the average travelling time for specific routes when necessary, so that drivers don't have to rush for each trip. He said the department would also check on drivers' physical conditions, but he conceded the scope would be limited. </span></p>

              <p><strong>TIB838H (KJDEP 172)</strong> brokedown @ CCK Ave 1 bus-stop at around 6pm++. Rear engine cover was opened at no one was at sight. Even the BC was gone, and the EDS displayed 'Off Service'.</p>
