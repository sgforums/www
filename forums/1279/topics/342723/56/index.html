              <p>TIB501D(AM 961) was spotted at Berth 14 of Woodlands Reg Int. There was a minor dent on the front left side of the bus. However the bus driver went to the back to open the engine cover. EDS was then switched off and breakdown triangle was placed at the rear of the bus, but after 5 mins hogging the berth, the bus was driven off under its own power. This was at around 1.15p.m.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.</p>
              <p>A unknown bendy was spotted just before the exit of Woodlands Reg Int. Engine cover was opened and there was a breakdown triangle too, just behind the bus. This was at about 1.30p.m</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.</p>
              <p>SBS9104B on 98M at Berth A6 of Jurong East Interchange couldn't start its engine. The mechanic at JE Int managed to kickstart the engine, but it went off service soon after. It then proceeded to SLBP to change its battery.</p>

              <p>SBS9614X on 143, at Pasir Panjang Road. Windscreen banged into a large flying bird at 60kmph. Despite that, the BC continued driving. Bird is believed to be KIA as it banged headfirst to the windscreen. First bang of its windscreen of that trip.</p>

              <p>5.</p>
              <p>SBS9614X on 143, at the turn into Jln Toa Payoh from Thomson Road. Windscreen smacked into a large branch off a tree at that bend. Thunderous thud was heard and the branch snapped off. Branch appears to be lying on the road. Second hit of that trip.</p>

              <p>SBS9614X on 143, at Toa Payoh Int. Hit tree branch before it's stipulated turn into its berth. Third hit of the day. At the end of the trip, miraculously despite the loud bangs and thuds there was no visible damage to the bus.</p>

              <p>That minor dent on 501D has been there since more than a month already. Below shows a picture taken in September this year. But I don't think 501D langa-ed into another vehicle, think something was wrong with the engine.</p>
