SBS 7444H on Service 25 was attempting to reverse out of Berth A27 at Bedok Interchange when the bus stalled and stopped in the middle of the road.<br>2. All passengers alighted and were ushered to wait at the berth. They subsequently boarded SBS 9432D.<br>3. Destos were down at time of witness.<br>4. Mechanics and "Green Men" were seen deployed to the scene to assist the bus captains.<br>5. Service 16 and 33 were similarly affected by this incident. SBS 8340S was attempting to move out but was unable to (delayed departure), but slowly inched it's way out later on.<br>6. SBS 9432D of Service 25 and SBS 0854D of Service 16 also experienced difficulties trying to reverse out. SBS 9432D had to do a V-shape manoeuver after reversing while SBS 0854D simply reversed but had to look out for SBS 7444H (the breakdown bus) to ensure it did not hit the rear of the breakdown bus.<br>7. Other arriving Service 16 and 33 buses simply had to make use of the other berths to park their bus.</p></div>
