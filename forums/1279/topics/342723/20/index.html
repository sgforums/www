              You guys seriously need a reflection on yourself. This includes you

              <p>I do get the point. I know there is self-reflection to be done and that is why I am trying to avoid getting into flame wars and stuff. I have no reason whatsoever to doubt TTS(I knew he was in CGA anyway coz I contacted him). I do not go to the extent of flaming others already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But you shouldn't have put it in such a tone... I don't hate TTS. But that doesn't mean I condone the flaming towards him. I just avoid it from now on. Please edit your comment. The first one. It is derogatory.</p>

              <p>IMHO only one barrier of that sort should be used. The T3 one. Buses and trucks(for some thing or another) can go thru T3 and have a thru-way to its Terminal, be it T1/2/3. Having barriers at every terminal wastes time, manpower, energy and most of of, money.</p>

              <p>If that is so then it is the AETOS/CAAS fault that their people did not do a good job. Bus parked just after the security barrier before entering T1. I believe you mean that before the bend rite? The width of the road there is quite wide so your bus "overtook" the 8194? If so my own prediction that T1 basement(the road) can safely take 2 buses side-by-side is true...</p>

              <p>I know. But I believe if CAAS routed all traffic one-way(that means w/o traffic like goods vehicles coming in at T1/2) and go thru one designated check(T3) and seal off the road between T3 and T1, then T1 and T2, then that area would be considered safe already.</p>

              <p>I happen to be onboard SBS8194Y to Changi Airport Terminal 1 to send my friend off. Took it from Tampines. This is my account of the actual incident.</p>
              <p>I was sitting at the 2nd last row of seats on the bus. After the usual security check involving the Certis Cisco Auxiliary Policemen coming onboard to check the bus for any unattended or suspicious luggage, the security barrier on the ground was lowered and the bus proceeded forward slowly.</p>
              <p>The front of the bus cleared without any problem and after the back wheel went over the lowered barrier, there was a loud and sickening bump at the back of the bus and it felt like the back of the bus had hit the ground similar to cars hitting their back bumper on steep humps. The passengers including the driver were shocked at the loud noise. The PRC driver then parked the bus at one side to allow the buses behind through and went to the back to inspect the damage. The passengers onboard were all looking at one another not knowing what actually happened. The bus driver came back after 2-3 minutes or so and he carried some metal debris onto the bus. The Indian Certis Cisco guard was telling the driver to park the bus at the basement so as not to block the other buses behind but the driver could not understand English and he was unwilling to do so saying in Mandarin that the back bumper had already came off how was he to drive to the basement. The passengers and I helped to translate to the driver what the guard was saying and vice versa but the driver did not want to move for fear of damaging the bus further. He then merely parked the bus at one side just after the barrier to let the buses behind go through. I asked the driver what has actually happened and he replied that the Certis Cisco guards had actually press the button to raise the barrier before the whole bus had actually cleared it. Human error on the Certis Cisco Guards lead to this incident happening and I finally found out the source of the loud bump.</p>
              <p>After 5 minutes or so with the bus driver refusing to drive the bus down to the Terminal 1 basement, some frustrated passengers then began alighting to walk down to the terminal basement themselves. Another Service 27 (SBS8195U) came along with another PRC driver. Our driver then flagged and stopped 8195 and we were then asked to transfer onto 8195. We then tap out on 8194 and got on 8195 without tapping. No breakdown tickets were issued as it was still chaotic then. The driver of 8194 was telling the driver of 8195 what happen and the driver of 8195 was saying this happened few times already as the Cisco Guards were too quick to raise the barrier but luckily save for scratches on the undercarriage, there were no serious damages to the buses then.</p>
              <p>8195 then moved off after all passengers had boarded and when I left, the 8194 driver was still arguing with the Certis Cisco guards. The 8195 driver then told me he was supposed to be behind 8194 by 11 mins but now he has to rush given Service 27's high passenger loadings and he will have to forgo his break at Terminal 2. Didn't have time to take pictures as everything happened so fast but luckily I paid cash so got ticket as picture. Anyone knows how much does it costs to replace the back bumper for the K230UB?</p>

              <p>I see... Thanks for the info, it cleared a lot of queries... IMHO these Certis Cisco/AETOS pple should do their job better. Ruining another company's fleet of buses(especially new ones) is not good... Wonder whether SBST would send the maintanence bill to CAAS/AETOS/Certis Cisco...</p>

              <p><br>Theres one time I took 27, to CGA, there were some maintenance work going on for the barrier, and buses had to use another lane beside it before going to CGA. Maybe a same incident happen before? I'm not sure.</p>

              <p>Always like that one~... Especially when you outsource this kinda work, the people doing it have no job security(as their contract might be terminated anytime) and they just do the very least... I have seen my fair share of these "security guards" not doing their job(like not thoroughly inspecting the bus, just plainly walking up and down and sometimes not even using the "mirror" to check the undercarriage of the bus).</p>
