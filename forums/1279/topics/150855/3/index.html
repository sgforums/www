I've been working for 30 years. I'm not going on to a new job.' - Mr Tan, whose departure is not linked to yet another redundancy round the SMRT is going through. -- ARTHUR LEE/BT<br><br>Mr Tan Hup Foi, 55, who has been in Tibs since 1987, will leave his post as SMRT deputy president on Oct 31.<br><br>His departure comes in the midst of yet another redundancy round where 47 employees were laid off on Aug 31.<br><br>It was the fourth such exercise since 2003.<br><br>An SMRT spokesman said the redundancies were part of an 'integration process' after SMRT's takeover of Tibs, which was completed in 2001.<br><br>The total number laid off is now 'over 100'.<br><br>Temasek-owned SMRT bought Tibs, founded by entrepreneur sportsman Ng Ser Miang in 1982, for $194 million.<br><br>SMRT, which employs over 5,000 people, has been streamlining resources and shedding non-core businesses. It closed a car rental and leasing unit in 2003 and sold its stake in Today newspaper last year.<br><br>'The servicing and maintenance of the Bukit Panjang LRT system used to be done by its own team. Now it's all done by SMRT,' said the spokesman.<br><br>'The automotive services division used to have its own head. Now the person who oversees bus services also looks after it.'<br><br>The resignation of Mr Tan, whose previous jobs were with the Public Works Department, Registry of Vehicles and Toyota distributor Borneo Motors, was not a case of redundancy.<br><br>He said yesterday: 'I just want to take a break. I've been working for 30 years.<br><br>'I'm not going on to a new job. Let's see what happens after my break.'<br><br>One Tibs pioneer credited him for developing 'a strong service culture' and 'building the Tibs brand'.<br><br>That brand - recognisable by its yellow-and-orange buses and cream taxis - was dropped last year when SMRT chief Saw Phaik Hwa decided to replace it with its own name.<br><br>SMRT is in the final phase of repainting the 800 buses and 2,000 taxis with its own red and black corporate colours.<br><br>In July last year, Tibs founder Mr Ng left the SMRT board. His exit was preceded by other former Tibs executives', including general manager Teo Joo Huak, Tibs Motors general manager Wong Joon Pok, and senior corporate communications manager Tay Poh Choo.<br><br>Senior human resources executive Karine Lim has also left.<br><br>With Mr Tan's impending departure, the only senior former Tibs stalwarts are director of buses Morris Piper and Mr Oh Seong Tatt, who heads SMRT's taxi business, which is now 3,000-strong.<br><br>SMRT is also in the midst of working out a new collective union agreement to replace the one that expired last year.</blockquote><strong></strong></div>
