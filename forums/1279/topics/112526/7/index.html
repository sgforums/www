            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">there are mainly 2 makes of gearboxes for buses used in Singapore. One is from ZF, the other is from Voith. Both are German companies.<br><br>ZF gearboxes used on our buses all have 4 gears. all but one of the buses using ZF uses the model 4HP500. Scania L94UB (SBS2888T) uses 4HP590 which is more suited for its 9-litre engine. ZF gearboxes feature a clutch lock-up at either the first or the second gear so dun mistake it as another gear (no 5 gears!). The advantage of ZF gearboxes is faster initial acceleration. Buses using ZF are:<br>- SMRTB Nissan UDs<br>- SMRTB O.405<br>- SMRTB Scania L113CRL<br>- SMRTB O.405G (some)<br>- SMRTB Hino HS3KRKK/HS3KRKA<br>- SMRTB Dennis Lance<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-II<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-IV DM (most)<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-IV Strider<br>- SBST Volvo B10MA Mk-IV<br>- SBST Volvo B10M-70 Mk-IV 14.5m<br>- SBST Volvo B10BLE<br>- SBST Volvo B10BLE-CNG<br>- SBST O.405G<br>- SBST Scania L94UB<br>- SBST Leyland Olympian<br>- SBST Volvo Olympian 12m<br><br>Voith gearboxes used on our buses all have 3 gears (they do have 4-speed gearboxes but they are not used in Singapore and they merely have an extra overdrive gear tat kicks in at 70kph hence it is quite redundant). Models used on our buses are in the format xxx.3, where 3 actually denotes the number of gear speeds. The first gear actually has a dynamic gear ratio as it is totally hydraulical, while that of the second gear is ~1.36 and for third gear, it is 1.0. The advantage of Voith gearboxes is better performance with turbocharger-fitted engines since it holds the engine at higher rpms before shifting, and high rpms means the turbocharger turbine spins faster and becomes more powerful. Buses using Voith are:<br>- SMRTB DAF SB220LT<br>- SMRTB O.405G (some)<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-III<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-IV DM (few)<br>- SBST Volvo B10M Mk-IV DM3500<br>- SBST O.405 (few)<br>- SBST Scania N113CRB<br>- SBST Dennis Trident<br>- SBST Volvo Olympian 10.4m<br>- SBST Volvo Super Olympian B10TL<br></div></blockquote>Thought that some SBST o.405 use merc gears?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If TIBS O 405 uses OM447hA only then it's turbocharged without intercooler.<br>By hearing without visual examination, i find it harder to detect the difference between turbocharged engine with intercooler to one without, unlike between naturally aspirated with turbocharged which is more obvious to detect.<br><br>The long standing practice used by M-B is 'A' for turbocharged &amp; 'L' for 'with intercooler'. Differences in engine revisions they tend to indicate by numbers after a decimal point after the engine model #.<br><br>The earlier diesels come with turbocharger only. Later on due to demand for even higher engine performance output with more stringent exhaust emission requirements, intercoolers were added to further reduce the intake air temperatures &amp; increase their density to extract higher output from the same size &amp; generation of engine.<br><br>There is some point in having turbocharger without intercooler as more parts means higher costs ! If one's performance &amp; exhaust emissions requirements are not so high or you already have a larger capacity engine with advanced management features, multi-valves etc. to start with, then maybe the intercooler (additional part) can be omitted. But cases like these are becoming more rare nowadays and the newer generation diesel engines tend to appear with turbocharger &amp; intercoolers as standard feature. This is to extract the highest possible performance output with least possible exhaust output with the smallest possible engine size.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">Tibs' O405 uses OM447hA only, no 'L'.<br><br>i thought 'L' means turbocharged, and 'A' is the first revision of the OM447h engine (like some sort of a mark II)?<br><br>and shldn't all turbochargers come with intercooler? without the intercooler there's really no point installing a turbocharger in the first place. the intercooler's function is to cool the hot &amp; compressed (by the turbocharger) air taken in so as to attain a higher thermal efficiency.</div></blockquote></div>
