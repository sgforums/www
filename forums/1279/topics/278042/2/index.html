If it is a bendy, it is high chance that the bus will be 169. This gives me or everyone with an interest of spotting buses an advantage. </span><br><br>Besides, the sounds of the buses are unique. Even with buses of the same brand and type, the engines sound may be different due to external factors.<br><br>I am more into bus routes. There are so many ways to get to different places in Singapore and I can say Singapore is not so bad in terms of bus networks although there are definitely areas to improve on. I like to read Transitlink Bus Guides because it is a pocket sized book, with colourful labels and the details are clear. Besides, different bus services have different demands as can be seen by the dds and bendys deployed on selective services. It is rather interesting to identify the hotspots that create the demand. </div></blockquote>yeah...this reminds me...cite another example then....if a sbs merc turn in from becoolen st to penang rd(YMCA bus stop there) i can safely identify it as 139.... for redhill estate...where there are two svcs 63,139 if i saw a oncoming strider it's comfirm to be 63 liao....and if u happened to be at redhill mrt bus stop upon sighting a dennis trident there....most likely it's 64 and if u sighted a NAC bus there comfirm to be 32 already...how interesting it is... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
