Some doesn't even care about how it looks like and think every bus looks the same.<br><br>Buses are interesting because<br><br>1) among other transportation, you won't ever see anything gets deployed like a bus. You could never say today the taxi cameoed at Woodlands yesterday and it is permanent in Ang Mo Kio right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) Every type of bus almost have different "voices".  they sound unique<br><br>3) those who took note of the bodies of the bus will generally pay a little bit more attention and have their favourite type of bus. Different bus bodies appeal to different people and they findit interesting when it comes along<br><br>4) people who take bus everyday might have feelings towards it, but percentage very low lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think other people got better answers than me loh ... ...</div>

Like for example, at a bus stop near Dieppe Barracks with 167, 169, 171 and 980, if one identifies a bus coming from a distance and it is a merc, there is a high chance that either 169 or 171 is coming. If it is a bendy, it is high chance that the bus will be 169. This gives me or everyone with an interest of spotting buses an advantage.<br><br>Besides, the sounds of the buses are unique. Even with buses of the same brand and type, the engines sound may be different due to external factors.<br><br>I am more into bus routes. There are so many ways to get to different places in Singapore and I can say Singapore is not so bad in terms of bus networks although there are definitely areas to improve on. I like to read Transitlink Bus Guides because it is a pocket sized book, with colourful labels and the details are clear. Besides, different bus services have different demands as can be seen by the dds and bendys deployed on selective services. It is rather interesting to identify the hotspots that create the demand.</div>

(the bus is SL 52, but i forgot rego.) seems like SBST refurbishment of 0405 quite good.<br></div>
