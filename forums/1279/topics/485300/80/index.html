              <p>I just went to Street 91 and finally spotted 3299L on 241 today, boarded the bus from Blk 962 at 4:56pm, however, I did not observe if there are any perm stix on the bus</p>

              <p>maybe it is due to the parking lots arrangement in depot? 138
              parking lots in AMDEP is beside sv57... sv57 buses alway do sv138
              on weekends.(but not really same buses) .. not so sure about 89/100
              parking lots though... </p>

              <p>Hmm, yeah the parking lots kind of have a role to play. I'm not too sure about Sv 89/100's parking lot allocation in HGDEP though. <br><br>All i know is that even before the KUBs came out (and that's before 2008 when the B1 KUBs came out), the Mk4s from Sv 100 back then already consistently appeared on Sv 89 on Weekends / PHs. So it's not really the same few Sv 100 buses every weekend / every Sat &amp; Sun. But more of, they'll pluck whatever Sv 100 buses and throw them to Sv 89 for the Weekend.</p>

              <p>Is <strong>9535R</strong> still seen?

              <p>not sure about 9535.. but if i remember correctly, that slot is usually 7476 slot.. (that time slot is WAB slot)... so either 7476 is out? or in workshop... or doing 9535 slot instead? </p>

              <p>Someone told me 9535R still spotted on Sv 25 on 17 May (Tues) though. So i guess 5332Y isn't replacing 9535R (yet). Probably one of the CDGEs is in the workshop i guess. <br><br>Likely same case as 3839D covering temp (for the crashed 3008K apparently for Sv 168)</p>
