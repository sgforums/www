So I'll leave that to him to confirm again. 8888D is on 6076T's timings today, didn't spot 6747R or 6759G yet on Sv 109 today. <br><br>3) I think high chance there's a fleet add to Sv 109 after Sv 109A was introduced.

              <p>Think for 3791C &amp; 3789P, your inference should be correct so far according to what I observe too.</p>
              <p>6050S has been on Sv 10 for quite awhile IIRC even before the ad went up. But not sure if any missing bus from Sv 10?<br><br>Doubt 3800P is perm Sv 168 though.
