              <p>No MIA buses though. 3759B still the only one left on Sv 12 &amp; hasn't flew yet. Everything else is accounted for.</p>
              <p>As for that fleet reduction, idk, i think i might have calculated the no. of buses wrongly previously. So apparently someone edited after that and somehow there was 1 extra bus &amp; he took that out (which made it seem like Sv 12 had fleet reduction)..<br><br>But Sv 12 no fleet add since Jan this year. So yeah. Idk. I'll probably try to find which WEG is missing. If you see them @ 1725hrs++ from NBR, it's likely the ex-AM SP / now perm BN 12 B4 WEGs on those slots though (10Y to 14L)</p>

              <p>I think SG-plated WEGs from BNDEP are staying in BNDEP for now.

              <p>Why not you go &amp; personally check the perm sticker on 6475A to confirm once &amp; for all? You check the perm sticker, the perm sticker will tell you everything okay? Thanks. <br><br>Same for 6477U (which you took out from the Sv 43 wiki page but left its status as HG 43 still on the Citaro page..).

              <strong>5314A</strong> is more likely under BNDEP instead
              though.<br> <br> <strong>5323Z</strong> that one.. the thing is BNDEP has been using
              those 12x SG-plated WEGs (or 14x if you include in new-new
              <strong>5333U 5335P</strong> not out on roads yet) as pure SPs to
              replace whichever MIA DDs they have on svcs. I keep seeing
              <strong>5320G 5321D 5323Z</strong> on Sv 12 in the past week for
              example, but no fixed slots for all 3 acc to what i see.</p>

              <p>5314A is likely the replacement for 3696Z. It is on a BN slot done by 3696Z/random single digit DD Wright rego earlier.</p>
              <p>I havent not spotted 9629D yet all this time still. Likely gone to spare.</p>
              <p>As for BB 196 side, likely it is receiving a CDGE. Seen one of them running on 196 consistently.</p>

              <p>Well, some of us did see 9629D on 196 when that bus first went to perm BN 196 on its 1st week.. and 9629D was marked to replace 3696Z anyway from the depot. <br><br>Although i don't exclude the possibility that maybe something happened to 9629D within the past weeks that rendered it stuck in the depot / workshop. Didn't see anyone posting 9629D on cameo anywhere lately<br><br>And anyway, 5314A isn't replacing 3696Z also. There was a 1-week gap between 3696Z going to BRBP &amp; 9629D going to perm BN 196. And during that 1-week gap, 3696Z's slot was filled by 3439A (which ironically was 3439A's original slot on Sv 196 that 3696Z replaced, after 3439A left for BN 6 &amp; then BN 17).</p>
