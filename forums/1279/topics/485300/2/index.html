              <p>TIB1233X TIB1234T<br> WLDEP SP &gt; WLBP 960<br> <br> Reasons:<br> 1. These buses doesn't even seem like performing as a Spare Bus. If
                  not it will be commonly seen cameo-ing on Woodlands Feeders /
                  Intra-Towns. <br> 2. These buses either stick to 960, 962, and 964, as 960 buses
                  are interchangeable with 962 and 964 bendies.<br> 3. I have taken those two buses on 960, usually on AP shift.<br> OR<br> 4. Fleet add, which is the impossible, as 270Y has been added into
                  the fleet under 960AP15, whereby lots of users confused whether
                  270Y is WLDEP SP or WLBP 960.<br> <br> In conclusion, there are 2 - 4 bendies got kicked out from

              <p>SMB270Y has a fixed slot. When SMB270Y went missing 504X* appears but when SMB270Y appears 504X happens to be missing.</p>
              <p>Formerly 504X is the duty 1 bus for 960 before being changed over to take 75.</p>

              <p>I think 3384Z is doing other service also lately but did 58 at first but as of 9389X think another normal DD will replace him soon. So most probably if 3384Z did 58 again on weekdays S shift,I think most probably fleet add to 21 buses</p>

              <p>There's 2 missing bus acc to Wiki~<br> <br> but, the more I look at the past edits on Wiki, it doesn't quite
              make sense? Someone added 3384Z to Sv 58, but then in between he or
              maybe someone else after him took out 8658B?<br> So doesn't this imply that 3384Z replaces 8658B? That totally is
              illogical, 1st time I see a BSEP bus replace a non-BSEP bus. BSEP
              buses should be fleet adds mah..</p>
              <p>The other missing bus is for 9389X's replacement, so that one is

              <p><br>58 needs DDs for UBI.. It is the only bus catering on this road, and in peak hours, you have 40-45 pax boarding at the middle stop... But agreed, they should have converted more SD slots to DD. But then i am happy if BSEP buses are added to routes rather than keep them spare.</p>
              <p>3347/48/49/54/55 are mostly spare... they operate only few days in a month.</p>
