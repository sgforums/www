I paid for two persons with a RM1 note (the fare was 50c flat), but he wouldn't put it in the cash box or issue any receipt. His attitude reminded me of those pirate taxi operators.

When SBS first introduced the One-Man Operation (OMO) back in the late 1970s, they did not convert the whole fleet of some services to OMO (at that time it was using step fare, not distance related fare).

Hmm...I remember during the conductor era that most (if not all) drivers don't bother to close the front door. Maybe to let in the air? Or maybe to not waste time at bus stops waintg for the doors to open and close? Those hydraulic doors are really slow but there are some which open and close with a bang.<br><br>I recall the various methods conductors use to alert the driver to move off. Shouting "Go head" was common. So was pressing the buzzer which was practised on SBS buses. Some would tap their ticket punch on the railing making a nice "ding ding" sound. Others would knock it on the roof making a horrid "bonk bonk" sound.<br><br>Whatever the case, one thing that I've never seen/recall were conductors on DDs. Were there any? Or were DDs reserved only for OMO?</div>
