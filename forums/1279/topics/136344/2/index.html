            <div class='col-md body'>I remember seeing bus conductors in London when I was there in 2000 on those typical London double decker buses. These kind of buses were special in that you could only board/alight at the back of the bus, and there was this man standing at the with some ticketing machine slinged on his neck. I presume that that is the bus conductor as l did not see any other mode of payment availabe. Didn't get to take those buses though.<br><br>As for those bus conductor hole punchers, I had been searching high-low for them. These punchers are special in the sense that the holes are smaller than those normal holes. Initially, l asked my dad who happened to visit Malaysia to bring in those punchers whose size are normal to exchange with the bus conductors, and they demanded an exchange fee of RM100 which my dad did not have enough cash with him then. Then my mom who happened to go JB managed to have a one for one exchange with the ticket inspector at the JB railway station.<br><br>Finally, after a fruitful search, I managed to find these punchers on the shelves of the bookshop at Bras Basah Complex, for only S$6.50. These are not the typical punchers made in china, but are from England.</div>

Some of their engines have been replaced with Scania ones, so that could be why they are powerful.</div>
