              <p><br>Other examples? Most SMRTB services have bad frequencies, only a few have good frequencies, which are a few, 67, 190, 851, 854, 913, just to name a few.</p>
              <p>Blame it on traffic jams again? Why not blame their half hearted efforts in their bus operations all these years, on top of the overcrowded population problem in this country and LTA's reluctant efforts to improve bus systems and to build seamless systems like the guided bus system to make bus journeys free from other obstructions?</p>
              <p>Back to topic, the buses used in these secondary services can jolly well use to improve bus services instead. Weekends doesn't mean that no one is using public buses. And the manpower and buses can be used for services that has very bad frequencies and high loading during weekends. As discussed before, services like 980 for example.  </p>

              <p><br>Same! I've been living in Yishun for a decade and although 39 provides a fast link to Pasir Ris, it never fails to surprise me with their 18-19 min frequencies... and their ultra slow speed along Lentor Ave that like every other SMRT bus overtakes it.</p>
              <p>During peak hours 39 will be something like clogging up the lanes at Lentor when every other car travels at around 80, an SMRT bus travels at average 65/70 and 39 travels at 50. -__-</p>
              <p>But I'm glad there's 85. 85 is like one of the wonderful short services with only 40 mins to Punggol. :) And loading during peak hours is fantastic. Guaranteed a seat even at opp. Compass Point during peak hours towards Yishun.</p>
              <p>I'm also grateful for services like 169, 171, 858, 965 and 969 that provide very quick links to the East or West (or North for 169) of Singapore. <strong>Never once</strong> have I waited longer than how long I usually wait for a 39 for the above mentioned 5 services.</p>
              <p>An exception is 857 though. A quick link to town but the waiting time pisses people off. Scheduled headway during Sundays is about 15-16 min and if there's a jam... =S</p>
              <p>I've also been regular user of 52 for the past few years (not recently though but I still use 52 if I consider going JE) and 52 never fails to surprise me with their irregular frequencies. I ever saw 2 52s departing Bishan together on an off-peak afternoon and the frequency ahead of the duo is 38 minutes.</p>
              <p>So I really find nothing much to complain about for SMRT... I'm really contented with the services they provide. And it's not like SBST is god or something; they too have their problems. Whether others can see the bigger picture or not is another story though.</p>

              <p><br>Ya, my scenario given was along Lentor Avenue... on an early morning where traffic volume is low, buses like to drive very fast along that stretch of road. Even the Volvos on 85 can do 65 kph but 39 always get overtaken (even by 85).</p>

              <p>18-19 mins freq for 39?? It depends on what time u take it. For a weekday afternoon its jus ard 12-15 mins..which i feel is gd enugh alr...compared to 852 or 855 which i can easily wait for &gt;20 mins. Worse still, very often i waited for 852 for 20+ mins and there it comes the 'sauna' bus (elbos).</p>
              <p>Speaking about SMRT buses overtaking 39 or 85, there are some SL who just ASSUME that nobody will board along Lentor Ave. I have seen some switching to the ctr lane aft the Yishun Stadium bus stop jus to overtake other buses..and not switching back to the left aft overtaking. There's a bus stop right aft the traffic junction and I wonder if there are pax who want to take the bus how can they cut back to the left lane fast enugh? I'm not opposing SL for overtaking, but they should do so appropriately, not when there's a bus stop so near.</p>
              <p>In fact, I've seen pax missing their bus becos of this..or becos the bus travel too fast and can't stop in time (even though the pax had flagged the bus early). I had witness it twice last year. Once was a 854 at the bus stop after Lentor Flyover (twds Yishun), the SL braked so hard but still stopped very far away. In the end, tat guy jus flagged for the bus behind. Luckily, no one was standing in the bus at tat time.</p>
              <p>In addition, driving fast in the bus lane along Lentor Ave twds Yishun during the evening peak hrs can be dangerous. What if one car suddenly filter into the bus lane?</p>
              <p>I agree that SMRT's schedule is way too tight..even the last traffic light..outside Yishun Int also need to beat red light. The record no. of buses i've ever seen beating that red light is 4 including 1 bendy..so dangerous!! esp when many ppl jaywalk at that junction by crossing diagonally across. Nothing happens then ok, dun wait till one day someone get knock down again.</p>

              <p>I'm pretty sure almost all complaints on 188R will be trips starting from IMM.</p>
              <p>But then a good amount of the profit from 188R will also originate from IMM during peak hours. (esp towards CCK) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>

              <p>18-19 mins freq for 39?? It depends on what time u take it. For a weekday afternoon its jus ard 12-15 mins..which i feel is gd enugh alr...compared to 852 or 855 which i can easily wait for &gt;20 mins. Worse still, very often i waited for 852 for 20+ mins and there it comes the 'sauna' bus (elbos).</p>
              <p>Speaking about SMRT buses overtaking 39 or 85, there are some SL who just ASSUME that nobody will board along Lentor Ave. I have seen some switching to the ctr lane aft the Yishun Stadium bus stop jus to overtake other buses..and not switching back to the left aft overtaking. There's a bus stop right aft the traffic junction and I wonder if there are pax who want to take the bus how can they cut back to the left lane fast enugh? I'm not opposing SL for overtaking, but they should do so appropriately, not when there's a bus stop so near.</p>
              <p>In fact, I've seen pax missing their bus becos of this..or becos the bus travel too fast and can't stop in time (even though the pax had flagged the bus early). I had witness it twice last year. Once was a 854 at the bus stop after Lentor Flyover (twds Yishun), the SL braked so hard but still stopped very far away. In the end, tat guy jus flagged for the bus behind. Luckily, no one was standing in the bus at tat time.</p>
              <p>In addition, driving fast in the bus lane along Lentor Ave twds Yishun during the evening peak hrs can be dangerous. What if one car suddenly filter into the bus lane?</p>
              <p>I agree that SMRT's schedule is way too tight..even the last traffic light..outside Yishun Int also need to beat red light. The record no. of buses i've ever seen beating that red light is 4 including 1 bendy..so dangerous!! esp when many ppl jaywalk at that junction by crossing diagonally across. Nothing happens then ok, dun wait till one day someone get knock down again.</p>

              <p>Sudden brake lor, thats what TIB779U - 963 driver did at W'lands Ave 3, Blk 402 bus stop. All cars at the back and side horned him and he still cut into left lane like nobody's business to let a pax board.</p>

              <p>but does SMRT care? They even dare to say CCL dwell time is more than enough.</p>
              <p>Even once taking 856, SL keep on chiong even as approaching bus stop. End up ppl miss their bus, unsafe to stop.</p>
