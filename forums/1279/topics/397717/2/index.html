              <p>because they are free to run bus services, basic or not, according to demand on non-working-day weekends, and this usually results in a smaller scheduled fleet than the holding fleet.</p>
              <p>thus, assuming there are enough buses to go around on a weekend, any decision to run these special services on weekends is considered solely on the basis of cost and revenue, i.e. profitability. the only upfront cost to SMRT is salary and fuel, since the bus will be "sleeping" inside the depot anyway if there were no such services.</p>

              <p>right. why not you go and plan how these primary resources should be allocated in your own context? and in bold. how many times do you need to be reminded of the first post you have made in the bus forum? you said a bus company should not be judged by their standards. and now you are judging the company based on the buses they are used.</p>

              <p>SBST has its flaws, mainly slow buses, and that is the main and only flaw in their system. If I want to compare SBST with Hong Kong buses, they are still way behind.</p>
              <p>No complains about SMRT? I just overheard two commuters on 851 complaining about 855 a few days back. When I took 961 just now, people are already complaining about frequencies. Look at the number of complains regarding about SMRTB in sites like STOMP, all these are more than enough to convince. And most of my friends living in the North and Northwest are so fed up with the bus services in their estates recently. Some wished that they can just drive to void all these stupid frustrations if they can afford one.</p>
              <p>Only the people here have no complains about them just because their buses are faster. Yes, that is their sole and only good point. </p>

              <p><br>For a company that has roughly half the number of buses as the largest incumbent, SMRT has been in the limelight too often IMO, and that's rather telling.</p>
              <p>And they really should clean up the 0405Gs and not wait for some major refurbishment to clear the cobwebs. Heck, even the VO2X which should be dirtier since its NAC and is of comparable age with older SMRT buses is cleaner.</p>

              <p>For a big company like SMRT which earns millions annually, they can be so stingy to buy a few buses just to replace those that should be deregistered since they are not road worthy and conditions that are so bad that gives so much complains.</p>
              <p>You seems to be eager to point out my flaws in my posts. In the post you quote, I am talking about new buses being brought. In this context, I am talking about how badly some models are being maintained and should be taken off the roads instead of continuing to let them run on basic services at lower bus service standards, which in turn the company should use the new buses instead to fulfill better service standards for basic services rather than emphasizing on secondary services.</p>
              <p>I am not aiming at any particular models for nothing, but the UDs and ELBOs are the worst maintained buses in Singapore public bus scene. Maintainance as in the service standards fared the worst for these 2 models. Since SMRTB can't be bothered to service and maintain them even to the basic standards of a proper bus condition, why continue to put them on service and let commuters suffer? UDs, especially the CACs, are supposed to be deregistered in 2009 already, why extend them anyway since their conditions are already bad? To the perception of bus fans, they are buses that are still within the age limit. But sorry, to the perception of the main public commuters, some can describe it as a 30 year old bus, and still on service with that kind of poorly maintained conditions. I have nothing against the OACs though.</p>
              <p>Even SBST oldest WA Mercedes Benz O405 is better maintained than the CAC UDs and ELBOs.</p>

              <p>when the bus comes late, passengers complain. when buses bunches up, passengers also complain. as a commuter of both SBST and SMRTB buses daily, for SMRTB frequencies may be quite bad for some, but most of them arrive on time. as for SBST its the same thing, except frequency is better, but not everytime they arrive on the stated time.</p>
              <p>how do you expect to improve the current bus system without affecting the bus services? you'll still get complaints from those who are affected by it. once again,  these issues please complain it elsewhere. you can write in to the relevant authorities to show your dislike about the population issue and to ask them to improve the bus system. complaining (or rather posting) it here will not achieve anything..</p>

              <p>Any type of bus, even a UD, can be a good bus as long as the maintenance regime does it job properly. SMRT has put so much into campaigns to try and improve their image, 
              surely walking the talk shouldn't be that hard either.</p>
              <p>New buses on the first day are already being driven around as if they were pieces of trash. Triangle on 1H right in the middle of an expressway, 67T's aircon panel wide open, both of Day 1 service.</p>
              <p>There are a few decisions which still puzzle me till today. Hinos on 925, OCs on RWS services and cameo on every other service frequently enough to be able to put together two or more new WAB routes.</p>
              <p>The other day I overheard from a commuter on board a perm OC, "<em>What's the point of having</em> <em>such new buses when we are squeezing right to the door? Where are the bigger buses we used to have</em> (referring specifically, to the bendy buses)<em>?</em>"</p>

              <p>Aiyo... you guys can complain all you want till the skies fall down - it's not going to change the fact that 188R will start operations on 1st May.</p>
              <p>And I agree with sgbuses - there needs to be more bendies as their capacity is higher, boarding and alighting is so much more efficient compared to a DD.</p>
              <p>I've taken 853 UDs for about 20 times since the start of the year. Their condition is excellent.</p>

              <p>For a big company like SMRT which earns millions annually, they
              can be so stingy to buy a few buses just to replace those that
              should be deregistered since they are not road worthy and
              conditions that are so bad that gives so much complains.</p>
              <p>You seems to be eager to point out my flaws in my posts. In the
              post you quote, I am talking about new buses being brought. In this
              context, I am talking about how badly some models are being
              maintained and should be taken off the roads instead of continuing
              to let them run on basic services at lower bus service standards,
              which in turn the company should use the new buses instead to
              fulfill better service standards for basic services rather than
              emphasizing on secondary services.</p>
              <p>I am not aiming at any particular models for nothing, but the
              UDs and ELBOs are the worst maintained buses in Singapore public
              bus scene. Maintainance as in the service standards fared the worst
              for these 2 models. Since SMRTB can't be bothered to service and
              maintain them even to the basic standards of a proper bus
              condition, why continue to put them on service and let commuters
              suffer? UDs, especially the CACs, are supposed to be
              deregistered in 2009 already, why extend them anyway since their
              conditions are already bad? To the perception of bus fans, they are
              buses that are still within the age limit. But sorry, to the
              perception of the main public commuters, some can describe it as a
              30 year old bus, and still on service with that kind of poorly
              maintained conditions. I have nothing against the OACs though.</p>
              <p>Even SBST oldest WA Mercedes Benz O405 is better maintained than
              the CAC UDs and ELBOs.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>you
              need to take note that the CAC UDs and the ELBOs are still serviceable
              buses, and that a portion of them are still maintained quite nicely.
              why should they deregister these buses since in your context they are
              not "roadworthy"? the lifespan of these buses are even lesser than SBST
              O405 WA buses. and all 3 types are still servicing and slowly retiring
              out of service. as long as there's regular maintenance and standards
              still kept at a generally acceptable level, i don't see the reason why
              can't these buses be still on service when the standards and
              maintenance of the newer buses can only be kept to a certain level when
              these buses "age over time".</p>
