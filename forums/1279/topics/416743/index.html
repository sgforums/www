              <p>Oh yes, on 922, 2 kids boarded TIB797S. They tapped when they enter. But when they passed the exit door, they tapped. Then this Indian BC opened the doors. Then he realized that the 2 kids tapped. And they got a lecture in front of everybody by the BC.</p>

              <p>Actually there's one time bus not yet departing and a person want to board immediately just to get a seat first. But another person come and say 'You dont go up anyhow, later they suspect you terrorist or what and they report you to the police'. Thats the most funniest.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, on 922, 2 kids boarded TIB797S. They tapped when they
              enter. But when they passed the exit door, they tapped. Then this
              Indian BC opened the doors. Then he realized that the 2 kids
              tapped. And they got a lecture in front of everybody by the BC.</p>
