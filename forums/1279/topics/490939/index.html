              <p>While the opening of the second stage of the Downtown Line today provides greater convenience for residents of the Northwest corridor, as well as students of the many notable schools along the Bukit Timah corridor, it also spells the potential dip in passenger demands of many bus services (notably 67, 170 &amp; 171) that currently duplicate the line.</p>

Will we still need high capacity double-deck or articulated buses which will potentially ferry lesser and lesser passengers such that a single-deck bus is probably sufficient by then.

              <p>Hi mr SBS7557R, good. Firstly, no more introduction of super long bus routes which will be covered by mrt mainly. Secondly, trunk routes will get shorter and will provide more direct type especially those last mile routes. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p><br>My take:</p>
              <p>66 (Jurong East - Little India) indeed has uniqueness even though duplicates DTL. I don't wish to see it being withdrawn or shortened...</p>
              <p>66 (Little India - Bedok) is considerably duplicative with a few services and shortening may be necessary, but I think it's better to amend the service and make it more unique instead of simply cutting it off.</p>
              <p>67 (Choa Chu Kang - Little India) duplicates DTL a lot but serves as good alternatives for BPLRT between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang, and already receives good loading. Can consider cutting but this part needs to be preserved.</p>
              <p>67 (Little India - Tampines) being shortened is strictly no no.</p>

              <p>I think you have captured it well. My thoughts are 66 should run between Jurong East looping @ Boon Keng Road, while 67 should run from Tampines looping at Middle road.</p>
              <p>There should be new short trunk from CCK looping at Beauty World, or merging with 171 to Marina Center, while 171 loops @ Beauty World (one of the two). </p>
              <p>You really don't need both 66 and 67 along DTL2 and 65/66 along DTL3.</p>

              <p>Free buses are provided when there is MRT breakdown. I don't think that is the right reason. </p>
              <p>66 should remain to provide fast connection between Bukit Timah and Serangoon Road. 67 needs to split into two.</p>

              <p>If it's a space constraint problem, a possible solution would be to extend some services (excluding southbound services) to Bt Batok. But given CCK's current services, this may end up counterproductive. Extending 700 to Bt Batok is somewhat counterproductive as well.</p>

              <p>I feel that in the past, when bus interchanges, terminals and depots are constructed, the authorities either did not set aside spare parking lots to reserve for future use, or did not allocate bus services to bus interchanges, terminals and depots rationally.</p>
                  
                  <p>As a result, today, most bus interchanges, terminals and depots are operating near maximum capacity.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now, when we build new bus interchanges, terminals and depots, we should start to have spare capacity to cater for future use.</p>
                  
                  <p>Apparently, this is what the LTA is doing. The new Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Changi Business Park Bus Terminal seems to have space reserved for future use.</p>
                  
                  <p>However, it does not seem that the bus services are allocated bus parking lots rationally yet. But I believe it takes time to master the "art" of assigning parking lots to bus services.</p>
                  
                  <p>In future, there should not be the problem of lack of capacity, thanks to what we are doing today. :)</p>
                  <p>I am sure the future generation will thank us for anticipating their future by having spare capacity today - although there is room for improvements.</p>

                                                      <p>I guess bus services 182 and 182M will be shortened to Tuas when the MRT opens. I guess a new bus service may originate at Tuas and loop at Joo Koon, with a role of helping the MRT if it breaks down.</p>
                                                      <p>Meanwhile, 256 is already looping.</p>
                                                      <p>Without 182 and 182M, there's only six bus services originating at Joo Koon Bus Interchange. As there is capacity for nine bus service, I assume there is (eventually) space reserved for three future bus services - 33.3% spare capacity.</p>
                                                      
                                                      <p>If 33.3% is the "usual" amount of space reserved for future use, I guess of the twelve parking lots at Changi Business Park Bus Terminal, four parking lots are reserved; would not be used in the near future (ten to fifteen years).</p>
                                                  <p>Really sincerely hope that the future Jurong East Bus Interchange and Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange will have a larger capacity than the current one. Otherwise, I would appreciate it if there can be at least one new bus terminal or interchange in the West region. This is so that the existing bus interchange at Jurong East, Bukit Batok, Boon Lay can have reduced number of bus services and also have around 33.3% spare capacity.</p>
                                                  <p>with Jurong Lake District, Jurong Innovation District and other possible Jurong Districts coming up in future, the existing capacity of bus interchanges and terminals in the West may (confirmed) not be enough. </p>
                                          
                                                  <p>I am sorry for overly emphasising on spare capacity for future use, but for a better tomorrow, I feel that our bus interchanges, terminals and depots today must have spare capacity reserved for tomorrow. Otherwise, we will still experience the problem of space crunch tomorrow.</p>
                          
                                  <p>Of course, you can say there's Jurong Region Line, Cross Island Line and possibly even Holland Line coming up in future. In the past, the idea was that the number of bus services will reduce as North East Line, Circle Line and Downtown Line are up and running. Clearly, that is not the case. As a result, today we experience space crunch. Let us not make the same mistake again. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Agreed, new trunk routes like 972 and 117/118 is probably the max nowadays.</p>
              <p>Despite the big fuss over splitting 76 into 76/134, I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg in LTA's plans to split long bus routes and/or make loop svcs 2-directional.</p>
              <p>The splitting of 76 and 189 which didn't even face the worst bunching/congestion problems shows that LTA wants to split/shorten routes for reliability, but is careful to frame them as 'service enhancements' providing new connections.</p>
              <p>Longer trunks through the city like 14, 51, 61 are much harder to split or shorten, and could either mean great disruption to more commuters and/or unnecessarily long duplicating sectors thru the city. We could see such routes being touched when Marina South ITH opens, though that may be 2021 or later (when the Thomson Line MRT stn is done). </p>
              <p>Similarly, bus svcs duplicating DTL2 may remain for now, or split/shortened/amended with the ends extended to provide new connections (eg 171 from Yishun to CCK/Bt Batok via Keat Hong and/or BB West).</p>
