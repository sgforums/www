              <p>I feel that in the past, when bus interchanges, terminals and
              depots are constructed, the authorities either did not set aside
              spare parking lots to reserve for future use, or did not allocate
              bus services to bus interchanges, terminals and depots
              rationally.</p>
              <p>As a result, today, most bus interchanges, terminals and depots
              are operating near maximum capacity.</p>
              <p>Now, when we build new bus interchanges, terminals and depots,
              we should start to have spare capacity to cater for future use.</p>
              <p>Apparently, this is what the LTA is doing. The new Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange and Changi Business Park Bus Terminal seems to have
              space reserved for future use.</p>
              <p>However, it does not seem that the bus services are allocated
              bus parking lots rationally yet. But I believe it takes time to
              master the "art" of assigning parking lots to bus services.</p>
              <p>In future, there should not be the problem of lack of capacity,
              thanks to what we are doing today. :)</p>
              <p>I am sure the future generation will thank us for anticipating
              their future by having spare capacity today - although there is
              room for improvements.</p>

              <p>The issues are that: a detour via Eng Neo Ave is too windy, a right turn from eastbound PIE to Adam Rd is impossible, and turning at Whitley Rd could mean skipping too many bus stops.</p>
              <p>Had the exit at Adam Rd been bidirectional, it would have been easy to simply redirect 700 to Adam Rd, then cut 171 after Upp Bt Timah Rd.</p>

              <p>The issues are that: a detour via Eng Neo Ave is too windy, a
              right turn from eastbound PIE to Adam Rd is impossible, and turning
              at Whitley Rd could mean skipping too many bus stops.</p>
              <p>Had the exit at Adam Rd been bidirectional, it would have been
              easy to simply redirect 700 to Adam Rd, then cut 171 after Upp Bt
              Timah Rd.</p>
              <p>Given their route length, 66 or 67 can consider some form of
              express if they are not going to be split / shortened.</p>

              <p>problem is that it is difficult to make certain services express along bukit timah road as there are still paxes boarding/alighting at each bus stop.. </p>
              <p>so which service can skip bukit timah road?</p>
              <p>the MRT there does not even go to clementi/bukit batok...</p>

              <p>I would add 960 as well.</p>
              <p>254 won't be impacted at all as along the route it does not meet the EWL Extension. 192/193 will meet at certain points and will act as short feeders as Tuas is a huge area</p>
              <p>+ 182 is there that does not cover a huge chunk of new Tuas south extension. There maybe a need for service there.</p>

              <p>I dont think it is fair to make buses stay in BTR just becoz a few pax boards it. As I could see most 66, 67 and 171 are running almost empty ever since DTL2 was a thing.</p>
              <p>I think these deserve a skip from the adverse conditions of BTR. In fact we are doing the majority at other sectors a justice with faster arrival and noticeably more reliable hea<span style="line-height: 1.231;">dways.</span></p>
              <p>I mean, KMB svc 40 had pax in Shum Shui Po too. But the move to make it express still did it good didnt it?</p>
