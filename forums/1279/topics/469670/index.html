              Always has this gripe with a pair of front facing seats right after the rear wheel arch on the MAN NL323F A22 - that grab pole sticking out from the seats =X

              Because of this pole, getting in and out of the outer seat is quite a pain especially if the rear facing seats above the wheel arch is occupied.

              <p>The problem is that they never follow KUB layout. By using the foldable seat, they have to use a pair of seat for support. The layout currently won't enable passengers infront to move to the rear. Instead, they will be stuck in between. </p>

              <p><br> nobody say it must follow KUB layout. the theory of the KUB layout
              for front half will help u answer. why only one seat for both
              on the right. go think about it. right or left probably also
              doesn't matter but left contain priority seats.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can look at it from a different perspective. Why do we want to have people move to the rear? Because the bus is full and people can't board, I suppose?</p>
              <p>The problem is passengers needs to get off soon and thus they want to cluster around the doors. No one can change the fact that they have to get off soon. If the operators want them to move to the rear, jolly well install another door at the rear! Why make everyone uncomfortable by forcing people who are getting off 1 or 2 stops later to move to the rear and then squeeze back out again?</p>
              <p>The first world solution to this problem is to have DD or Artics replacing the 12m bus, or otherwise increaseing the frequency. Easily the capacity problem would be solved.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In a not so first world country like singapore, we manage it by using "crush loading" and create as much space as possible between the two axles of the bus so everyone can be packed into the sardine can. This is done effectively in the OC and KUB, and even the B10BLE.</span></p>
              <p>Now, going back to the A22, obviously they are trying (and failing) to do something like that, especially that there is more room between the front and rear axle since the door can be shifted back by 1 seat length.</p>
              <p>Eventually we will end up with a design like the Citaros for Red Arrow services in London, completely void of seats between the low floor area for crush loading.</p>
