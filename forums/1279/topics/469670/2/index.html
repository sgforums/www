              <p>Nobody is going to suspect anyone right here, as those suspected had already been confirmed to be as part of the clones.

              <p>I can't decide whether it is right or wrong to start a flame war against clones, it is just that the spamming of the pages right here had make me feel somewhat disgusted.

              <p>I seriously hope that you may either stop your arguments (like in a way if you say 'you can't bothered to be dealing with these clones) or rather, reduce the amount of flame war content. I had actually seen the previous page that you are also flaming with those neutral bus enthusiasts, so it may be actually wrong. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">That's all I had to say. </span></p>

              <p>Though I hate to see the older buses like the DAFs gone so early, but SMRT should have really gotten rid of them so that the MANs can set down on deployments...</p>
              <p>or rather, KJDEP should have taken in the newer MANs, after all in the first place, no MANs were send back to WLDEP from KJDEP except those buses and services that were involved in the depot transfer this February to March, unlike AMDEP just because of that 'cracked windscreen' incident where it will only take in MANs for BSEP and not for normal services...</p>

              <p>Wow. Another new user came just to call other people names and then saying that I'm in the wrong? Seriously man, you don't seem to understand what my post means.</p>
              <p>I can't decide who should stop flaming the clones, but actually if you had read some other threads, I can say that he is flaming people that are not part of the clones. Even if it is the clones, what I said is an advice to him, not an order.</p>
              <p>I had also mentioned that I can't decide whether it is right or wrong, so I agree with you on the second point. I had no reason to suspect whether you are part of the clones, but your action of calling other people names makes me disgusted.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, I would surely need the help of those who were involved in this bus hobby to explain to you and a few other new users right here. I have not much power to be involved in all these flaming wars.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Perhaps you can look at it from a different perspective. Why do
              we want to have people move to the rear? Because the bus is full
              and people can't board, I suppose?</p>
              <p>The problem is passengers needs to get off soon and thus they
              want to cluster around the doors. No one can change the fact that
              they have to get off soon. If the operators want them to move to
              the rear, jolly well install another door at the rear! Why make
              everyone uncomfortable by forcing people who are getting off 1 or 2
              stops later to move to the rear and then squeeze back out
              again?</p>
              <p>The first world solution to this problem is to have DD or Artics
              replacing the 12m bus, or otherwise increaseing the frequency.
              Easily the capacity problem would be solved.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In a not so first world
              country like singapore, we manage it by using "crush loading" and
              create as much space as possible between the two axles of the bus
              so everyone can be packed into the sardine can. This is done
              effectively in the OC and KUB, and even the B10BLE.</span></p>
              <p>Now, going back to the A22, obviously they are trying (and
              failing) to do something like that, especially that there is more
              room between the front and rear axle since the door can be shifted
              back by 1 seat length.</p>
              <p>Eventually we will end up with a design like the Citaros for Red
              Arrow services in London, completely void of seats between the low
              floor area for crush loading.</p>

              <p>TBH, that area removed don't even look spacious(and yes that's why you mention about failed). <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Like I've said, there's no point removing the side that's fitted with the foldable seat. The space there is almost the same. </span></p>
              <p>Infact, the full low floor layout is not friendly to carrying higher capacity..</p>

              <p>To DX 2437:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">What I am saying currently have no offence, but what I observed from yesterday until now is that you had been trying to deal with the clones like SMB388S and as a result giving many posts, from what I believed it sounded like some other users (who were eventually accused of being a part of the plan which involved the clones) that kept starting flame wars with the clones.</span></p>
              <p>Nobody is going to suspect anyone right here, as those suspected had already been confirmed to be as part of the clones. But seriously all those happenings in the forums recently that has something to do with the buses (MANs, Scanias and Citaros) had make people losing trust in one another, probably due to several argument issues over comparisons.</p>
              <p>I can't decide whether it is right or wrong to start a flame war against clones, it is just that the spamming of the pages right here had make me feel somewhat disgusted. Look at all the clones here, they had already spammed the pages since the start of last year by advertising about their so-called "safe" and "comfortable“ buses, and with you and some other anti-clone enthusiasts around, we can't seem to hold out for much longer over these issues.</p>
              <p>I seriously hope that you may either stop your arguments (like in a way if you say 'you can't bothered to be dealing with these clones) or rather, reduce the amount of flame war content. I had actually seen the previous page that you are also flaming with those neutral bus enthusiasts, so it may be actually wrong. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">That's all I had to say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thank you.</span></p>

              <p>I thought somebody said that let others say what they want? And Can't be bothered? Apparently you also don't think and post~ I'm not perfect, but I just want to say that you seriously lack of something. Don't you know that others' provoking BIS have nothing better to do? Just like the old saying - "Don't feed the troll". </p>
