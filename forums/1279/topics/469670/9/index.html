              <p>Modifying a chassis to adopt RHD config is not impossible, but very tedious and expensive.</p>
              <p>Imagine having the redesign the entire rear structure, including flipping around every single component from the radiator, turbocharger lines, fuel lines, air lines, gearbox, coolant tank and even the exhaust. All of this has been incrementally designed, improved, built and tested over many years for the LHD version. (E.g. developing from the O405 to O405N, O405N2, first gen Citaro, Citaro facelift, and finally Citaro C2 Euro 5 and Euro 6)</p>
              <p>The redesign itself would also require the manufacturer to retest the completed chassis repeatedly on various conditions, and to ensure all components works properly. I am sure you all remember what happened with the London Citaros by putting the fuel lines too near to the turbo, even when they did this small configuration to RHD without shifting the engines at all.</p>
              <p>It is probably even easier to rebuild a chassis from scratch if most parts cannot be reused.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not unworkable, but the costs involved in trying to either invert the arrangement or shift components around to make it suitable for 3 door RHD operations will render such a move financially unwise for the manufacturers, especially when most of the world are using LHD. It is akin to having another chassis on its own.</div>

              <p>Yes, the barriers have been overcomed, but only by <strong>1</strong> manufacturer and that is Wrightbus whose chassis has been pictured above in blue.</p>
              <p>As TIB1234X has guessed, it is the NBFL, but extremely pricey at 700k SGD per unit (as of today) due to the custom design and R&amp;D work it has gone through.</p>

              <p>Of course, feel free to share if there are any other RHD 12m low floor chassis that has the ability to install a 3rd door after the axles. It would be a great addition to the fleet here for use on routes where it has high passenger turnover.</p>

              <p>Modifying a chassis to adopt RHD config is not impossible, but
              very tedious and expensive.</p>
              <p>Imagine having the redesign the entire rear structure, including
              flipping around every single component from the radiator,
              turbocharger lines, fuel lines, air lines, gearbox, coolant tank
              and even the exhaust. All of this has been incrementally designed,
              improved, built and tested over many years for the LHD version.
              (E.g. developing from the O405 to O405N, O405N2, first gen Citaro,
              Citaro facelift, and finally Citaro C2 Euro 5 and Euro 6)</p>
              <p>The redesign itself would also require the manufacturer to
              retest the completed chassis repeatedly on various conditions, and
              to ensure all components works properly. I am sure you all remember
              what happened with the London Citaros by putting the fuel lines too
              near to the turbo, even when they did this small configuration to
              RHD without shifting the engines at all.</p>
              <p>It is probably even easier to rebuild a chassis from scratch if
              most parts cannot be reused.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not to forget, developing a 3rd door means shifting of the parts to the right side near the fan... Weight distribution had to be balance as well... For that its also very tricky... One wrong placement, chassis will bend...</p>

              <p>The issue is not with the staircase, but rather to do with leaving the rear platform doors open while the bus is moving. This is a "Health and Safety" issue even in the UK itself, which is why they have to deploy passenger assistants at the doors when they are open.</p>
              <p>The doors could be configured to be controlled by the drivers instead of being left open for export versions, and this wont be a problem anymore. It still fulfils the job of having a 3rd door to get passengers to move in.</p>

              <p>Regardless of NBfL being a hybrid bus or not, it is still by far the only production RHD chassis till date in the world to be able to accomodate a 3rd door without steps.</p>
              <p>Remember that we are not trying to buy a hybrid DD, but rather <span style="line-height: 1.231;">a RHD low floor bus that has a door after the rear axle. The fact is that the NBfL is still the only production ready example around and it costs 700k.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">They could get one of the chinese bus makers to design and make one cheaply based on pure diesel tech. But till then, the price difference of a bus with that door and without is just too big. This is the point i'm trying to bring across.</span></p>
              <p>However, i agree with you that for hybrid DDs, it is not expensive at all to pay 700k although it is still 10% more than competing hybrid DDs. This 10% gives you 1. airconditioning, 2. 3rd rear door, 3. very customisable design, which is well worth the money.</p>
              <p>As for procurement strategy, i find it not so valid on our public operators' case, since it is tender based instead of by quotation. Also, it is also a double edged sword to take up too much different bodyworks and chassis since it would be a maintanence headache (look at tibs who simply went too far on this).</p>
