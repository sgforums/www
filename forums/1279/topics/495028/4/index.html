                      <p>How is this lobbying? They are just standardizing the design, to make it easier to maintain in future. The new roof is obviously taken from Mercedes-Benz Citaro, whereas the body and everything is probably from MAN A22. In future, the road ahead could be to source standard parts from the various manufacturers and ownself configure into a bus with Singapore signature.</p>
                      <p>Maybe itâ€™s to reap economies of scale, as standardizing parts means able to purchase parts at large quantities, thus saving on delivery charges and packaging, etcetera. Iâ€™m expecting this roof to also apply to the new double decker bus which they are going to make.</p>

                                      <p>To be honest, this looks like the Sentosa bus when you look from the back. Maybe itâ€™s Citaro roof, Sentosa bus body, MAN engine and MAN front. And because itâ€™s MAN engine and MAN front, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s considered a MAN product. Just my assumption.</p>
                          <p>On the Sentosa bus body, itâ€™s probably Volvo B9TL body that we are talking about.</p>

              <p>Standardization? So how did Singapore's A95s end up with at least three bodywork variations?</p>
              <p>Don't start talking about evolution or improvement. The bodywork variations (and other units produced for other operators) show this is mainly an aesthetic change.</p>
              <p>There will be a demand for bodywork spares because accidents happen over time. GML can produce the spare parts now suited to the variation for now. But if GML doesn't exist tomorrow or stop producing older parts, it's going to be a nightmare for fleet management.</p>
              <p>If you think that bodywork manufacturers will last forever, Custom Bus has just collapsed. Cities who have been relying on Custom for new buses suddenly have a parts problem and are forced to buy small new batches from other suppliers because they don't know what to do next.</p>
              <p>And already we have someone asking for the fourth bodywork design because it significantly deviates from the one just released in Germany.</p>
              <p>At least the Citaro and the B9TL orders from SBS Transit has consistent designs.</p>
              <p>The bus lobbyists have been arguing for a standardized design when they want more of something. Then against a standardized design when they don't like what they see or start to get bored of it.</p>
              <p>Or whatever rocks their boat. Or fits their arguments. Trump style.</p>
              <p>And least of all, the lobbyists have been attempting to get LTA to distribute all the models/variants
                                   across operators. And then rail against operators who resist 
                                  accepting a handful of units.</p>
              <p>I thought LTA has finally cleaned up the act. Only to allow another mess again.</p>
              <p>And LTA and KBW starts wondering why bus operations are 60% more costly now and how on Earth they are going to pass on the increased costs.</p>

              <p>Two cents? Are you willing to pay? How about two dollars minimum card bus fare for a start?</p>
              <p>Adelaide has over 40 designs, card fares start from $3.62 ($1.96 feeder)</p>
              <p>Melbourne has 25 designs for just one operator alone, card fares start from $4.30 ($2.94 feeder).</p>
              <p>London has been getting quite a number of new designs lately, card fares start from £1.50 (S$2.75).</p>
              <p>All three of them adopt BCM as well. They also have so-called similar internal parts, but plenty of different bodywork designs.</p>
              <p>LTA is losing money hand over fist to subsidize public bus transportation. Your 2% GST increase for one year already isn't enough to cover the subsidy of $4 billion over the next 5 years.</p>
              <p>Think about how every 5 cent you spend on your daily lunch goes towards your new fancy buses...</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with this. While existent, costs associated with the procurement of different bus makes are meagre compared to many other factors such as manpower and administration costs, and core components are the same anyway no matter the bodywork so it doesn't really add up much. It's regrettable that some here continue to adamantly exaggerate the truth, overstating the costs when many other countries still have low fares with multiple bus makes.</p>

              <p>The scenario for trains is worse. If you don't stock enough spare parts for the variety of rolling stock previously procured, the trains will break down frequently. And when they break down, they block the line and cause delays and disruptions. Why do you think the trains are more unreliable on NSEWL than the other lines?</p>
              <p>The bus operator has to retrain each driver and mechanic for every new model that comes in. And then there's operational problems. For example, BCs who struggle to operate the EDS controller to get the EDS code correct for every different model. Why would SMRT replace SMB5888H's original EDS when it is still so relatively new? Why wouldn't operators continue to operate older demonstrators in revenue service in recent years?</p>
