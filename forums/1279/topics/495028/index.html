              <p>Wow so fast set up, thumbs up to u! On the contrary i rmb seeing another thread that wanted to replace this yearly thing...</p>
              <p>Anyways a few question: NBR Ter relocation is Q2? I thought Q1? Relocation of JUR int also Q2? I dont see a new site for it leh... unless i missed it out when i visited there a few weeks ago.</p>
              <p>Hope the JRL could be announced soon... Sekali they delay again haha... Also expect some bus route amendments coming up next year, prolly Q2 onwards</p>

              <p>About New Bridge Road Bus Terminal, latest intel is that the road works are still on-going, and would probably handover only in mid-January or February. Opening around mid-March to April. So, to avoid anticipation, just expect the opening in Q2; April to June.</p>
                                      <p>About Jurong East Bus Interchange, it was in the news previously. [[<a href="http://www.channel8news.sg/news8/singapore/20170619-sg-jebusinterchange/3745804.html">Click here for the article</a>]] Chinese article, but basically it says that there will be another Jurong East temporary Bus Interchange located next to JCube in Q3 of 2018.</p>
                                      <p>About Jurong Region Line, the expected announcement date was Q4 of 2017... by finding the duration between Thomson East Coast Line announcement of line to announcement of stations, and adding the duration to the announcement of Jurong Region Line in 2013 to find the probable station announcement date... but Q4 of 2017 over already. So, Q1 of 2018 is very likely. Also, soil investigation works already simmer down. Though still have every now and then, it’s already not as large-scale. The announcement may happen anytime soon.</p>
                      <p>But, to be honest, I’m already tired of waiting, especially ever since I realised the Jurong Region Line is just a copy of the Docklands Light Railway in the UK. What we really want is a pan-island train line that runs from Jurong to other parts of Singapore, not a showcase line that only acts as a jewelry for the over-glorified Jurong Lake District (it’s just a Regional Centre like the one in Woodlands and Tampines, for goodness sake)... well, just saying.</p>
                                      <p>About bus route amendment, if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. I understand the concern about duplication of resources. What I suggest is that the authorities should only amend bus routes that do not ferry a certain amount of passengers during peak period. Eg: 50% of single decker capacity; about 40 passengers. For those that are able to pick up substantial amount of passengers, we should just keep it as it is.</p>

              <p>Agreed :).</p>
              <p>What u said abt the JRL is rly true, smth i nvr thought of b4. I was wondering if u look at the map, Jurong is one of the bigger towns, but not so well "intra-connected". Plus, authorities also planning the new Tengah estate, and places like NTU not so well connected at all. Maybe that line could the reason why JRL is conceived, and i dun think it's sole purpose is to bootlick the Jurong Lake District proj.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, the map provided by the blueprint is kinda messed up. I would have prefered smth more easier</p>

              <p>I may think that this is an appropriate starting point to decide whether the said services should be amended (extensions, cutback and/or re-routing) or withdrawn. But there should also be amendments to provide new links; i.e. I have been personally hoping for 960 and 700/700A to swap routes along the sector between Whitley Road and Bras Basah Road such that there's a direct trunk link from Woodlands to Orchard.</p>

                          <p>Iâ€™m expecting more competition in the mobile phone hauling industry. Currently itâ€™s just Uber and Grab. This industry is lucrative. I expect more players to come in to get a share of the pie.</p>

                          <p>To be honest, there are too many bicycle sharing apps and too many bicycles idling around. The demand is only so much. I expect bicycle sharing apps to scale down their business or even exit the industry. This service does not yield long-term demand, just short-term ones. Considering this, and also public transport is cheaper, faster and more convenient, the bicycle sharing industry is not going to last.</p>

              <p>To be honest, there are too many bicycle sharing apps and too
              many bicycles idling around. The demand is only so much. I expect
              bicycle sharing apps to scale down their business or even exit the
              industry. This service does not yield long-term demand, just
              short-term ones. Considering this, and also public transport is
              cheaper, faster and more convenient, the bicycle sharing industry
              is not going to last.</p>

                          <p>Grabshuttle... err... yeah... few years ago, the beeline and all seem promising, but after a while, like not that popular... maybe itâ€™s because all the adequately-demanded bus routes already provided, and the customer base is only so small. I donâ€™t expect private bus industry to grow or reduce, but just maintain as it is.</p>

              <p>Quite wrong about bicycle sharing. This new, unprecedented form of first/last mile connection mode has been highly popular and supported by the government in line with the vision to promote public transport and the usage of bicycles as a transportation mode in place of cars.</p>
              <p>You must be either ignorant or myopic to even see public transport as a substitute to bike sharing, when it is actually a compliment. Unless you think people actually cycle from Jurong to Tampines. </p>
              <p>In terms of demand, it is already telling given the constantly empty bike racks during peak hours. And long term benefits have been mentioned above. </p>
              <p>Though I may agree that bike firms may scale down operation, but due to another reason. Given that bike sharing is ultimately the means used by start-ups to raise funds, the fact that bike sharing firms such as Mobike and Ofo has now gotten the back of major firms such as Alibaba and Wechat, may soon mean that bike sharing as a business model has lost much of its function as an idea to sell to potential investors. Therefore, in wanting to venture into more lucrative product markets e.g. Grab investing in digital wallets, these firms may hence reduce bike sharing operations to free up resources for investment in other areas.</p>

              <p>1. Its going to be white elephant after all.</p>
              <p>2. With zero car growth, I expect more bus routes to be introduced. But definitely to the extent of DTL3 for TEL (Thomson), the DTL2 will be used for TEL (East Coast).</p>
              <p>3 and 4. Canberra station is needed because the future residential population is not catered for the crowds at Sembawang and Yishun. You cannot just rely on 117, 169, 859 and 883 only.</p>
