              <p>We asked that question back in 2009 when the Yutong, Sunlong and Zhongtong showed up. The lobbyists then had a field day. We know what happened since.</p>
              <p>I expect a similar outcome. That being said, certain brands such as Yutong do make comparative decent products these days. The established European manufacturers have also largely outsourced their production out of their home countries, so they can't claim superiority in a manner they used to (though they will still try).</p>

                                          <p>Quite wrong about bicycle sharing. This new, unprecedented form
                                          of first/last mile connection mode has been highly popular and
                                          supported by the government in line with the vision to promote
                                          public transport and the usage of bicycles as a transportation mode
                                          in place of cars.</p>
                                          <p>You must be either ignorant or myopic to even see public
                                          transport as a substitute to bike sharing, when it is actually a
                                          compliment. Unless you think people actually cycle from Jurong to
                                          Tampines. </p>
                                          <p>In terms of demand, it is already telling given the constantly
                                          empty bike racks during peak hours. And long term benefits have
                                          been mentioned above. </p>
                                          <p>Though I may agree that bike firms may scale down operation, but
                                          due to another reason. Given that bike sharing is ultimately the
                                          means used by start-ups to raise funds, the fact that bike sharing
                                          firms such as Mobike and Ofo has now gotten the back of major firms
                                          such as Alibaba and Wechat, may soon mean that bike sharing as a
                                          business model has lost much of its function as an idea to sell to
                                          potential investors. Therefore, in wanting to venture into more
                                          lucrative product markets e.g. Grab investing in digital wallets,
                                          these firms may hence reduce bike sharing operations to free up
                                          resources for investment in other areas.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Research shows that the local bicycle sharing usage is low, with the bicycles not used for around 23.5 hours everyday</strong></p>
                                          <p>Whereas the number of shared bicycles has been rising over the past year, a study involving 10 thousand shared bicycles revealed that most bicycles were used less than 2 times everyday, the bicycles were not used for 23.5 hours everyday, and the usage rate is low. Researchers noted that besides controlling the operatorâ€™s bicycle fleet size, improvements to infrastructure and other methods could be used to increase the usage rate and make the business sustainable.</p>
                                          <p>Researchers from Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology Centre Future Urban Mobility Interdisciplinary Research Group conducted the study between April and May last year. Data from â€œone of the largest bicycle sharing operatorsâ€� in Singapore was observed over a nine-day period to obtain the bicycle usage numbers. The report was published in February this year.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>The report shows that the operator they observed had increased its bicycle fleet size from 8 thousand bicycles to 10 thousand bicycles, of which 14.3% of the bicycles were completely not used over the 9-day period. The remaining bicycles were used less than 2 times everyday on average, and the average cycling duration was less than 30 minutes.</p>
                                          <p>One of the researchers noted that although the numbers indicate a low utilization rate of shared bicycles, it is difficult to forecast the future numbers and trends of shared bicycle usage as bicycle sharing is still relatively new in Singapore.</p>
                                          <p>The researcher also mention that besides controlling the operatorâ€™s bicycle fleet, other methods like improving infrastructure could be used to increase the shared bicycles usage rate.</p>
                                          <p>â€�Singaporeâ€™s weather is hot and the weather is often rainy. If sheltered cycling paths could be built, this may encourage more people to cycle, and make bicycle sharing services more popular.â€�</p>

              <p>I think it cant be the case... rmb the blueprint they provide? The line is not clearly linear and there are many branching points. This is unseen so far in our MRT/LRT system. And the fact that they call it MRT, I doubt they would change their minds at all. It is the responsibility of LTA to announce the project before they start work, otherwise imagine when the poor residents living nearby the site suddenly see random constructions ongoing, they are going to lodge complains the the government asking them why they never inform them before hand about what unknown project it is going to be.</p>

New depot expected, but interim depot would be at JRL depot location at Tengah.</p>
                                                          
                                                          <p>- line 3 expected to extend westwards from NTU to Gul Circle and absorb the proposed EWL Tuas South Extension from Gul Circle to Tuas South, to become a separate RTS system from Tuas South to Jurong West. Dedicated depot expected at CRL Tuas depot location.</p>
                                                               
                                                     <p>** the reason for no JRL announcement as yet is probably because JRL has been revamped into 3 separate MRT lines, which would be announced as part of the Land Transport Master Plan this year. And since itâ€™s new lines altogether, they may want to reveal the JRL together with the unveiling of the LTMP.</p>
                                              <p>- Nonetheless, previously known details of the JRL are expected to remain the same, except now they are also applicable for the 3 new lines likely to originate from the JRL plan. (ie. narrower trains, 4-cars, etc.)</p>
