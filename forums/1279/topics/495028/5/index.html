              <p>The reason why SBST's specifications are inside LTA's tender specification is due to LTA being absolutely clueless about specifications. Don't forget that LTA's BCM is very new, they have been riding on SBST and SMRT tender, buying buses in a form of option/extension under SBST/SMRT's tender buy. So the easiest way for the lazy civil servants to come out with a tender specification is to copy and paste SBST/SMRT tender spec blindly, then add in or edit what additional stuff LTA wants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact SMRT's specifications can also be found inside the tender spec. Only a few of the new stuff which I mentioned are original from LTA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This will be a standard for future public buses. All operators will receive buses with the same specifications.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I can tell you that SMRT does not favour automatic kneeling. They prefer manual kneel, which means the driver has the option and control when to kneel. If you take before SMRT procured buses, they never kneel at all, the drivers hardly use this, some even disable or hide the function from the drivers. Which is why LTA tender specs also asked for an option to switch between automatic and manual kneel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LTA wants to satisfy everyone, at a cost which commuters will bear.</p>

              <p>Standardization? So how did Singapore's A95s end up with at
              least three bodywork variations?</p>
              <p>Don't start talking about evolution or improvement. The bodywork
              variations (and other units produced for other operators) show this
              is mainly an aesthetic change.</p>
              <p>There will be a demand for bodywork spares because accidents
              happen over time. GML can produce the spare parts now suited to the
              variation for now. But if GML doesn't exist tomorrow or stop
              producing older parts, it's going to be a nightmare for fleet
              management.</p>
              <p>If you think that bodywork manufacturers will last forever,
              Custom Bus has just collapsed. Cities who have been relying on
              Custom for new buses suddenly have a parts problem and are forced
              to buy small new batches from other suppliers because they don't
              know what to do next.</p>
              <p>And already we have someone asking for the fourth bodywork
              design because it significantly deviates from the one just released
              in Germany.</p>
              <p>At least the Citaro and the B9TL orders from SBS Transit has
              consistent designs.</p>
              <p>The bus lobbyists have been arguing for a standardized design
              when they want more of something. Then against a standardized
              design when they don't like what they see or start to get bored of
              it.</p>
              <p>Or whatever rocks their boat. Or fits their arguments. Trump
              style.</p>
              <p>And least of all, the lobbyists have been attempting to get LTA
              to distribute all the models/variants across operators. And then
              rail against operators who resist accepting a handful of units.</p>
              <p>I thought LTA has finally cleaned up the act. Only to allow
              another mess again.</p>
              <p>And LTA and KBW starts wondering why bus operations are 60% more
              costly now and how on Earth they are going to pass on the increased
              costs.</p>

              <p>Like what Iveco said,Probably wait till SMRT AMDEP SVC transfer to Mandai Depot and LTA will probably remove the fence and build a connection to the Depot.With some refurbishment,SBST AMDEP can get around 600 capacity but again the condition of the  road surface at SBST AMDEP is very terrible.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to make BRBP a fully bus depot with 500 capacity and transfer all CDG operations to AMDEP is more better or simply find a remote location along Upp Thomson for a new Depot.</p>

              <p>LTA owns all the infrastructures and also buses and trains.Operators only manage and maintain and fares are retained by LTA la dey,Operators only earn through a yearly fee,EWT/First and Last bus,On Time Arrival incentives..Also advertisement and rental of tenants at their respective Int and Ter.There will be incentive too for keeping the buses clean.</p>
              <p>SMRT is the anchor operator at Yishun although they’re the minority.</p>

              <p>btw, yesterday I thought I heard over the radio that the Jurong Region Line is cancelled. It was proposed to be elevated, 20km. but now the authorities are looking at replacing the proposed Jurong Region Line with other new lines, for more economic effectiveness (ç»�æµŽæ•ˆç›Š). research works already carried out for parts of the line will be re-used. And plans will be announced in the later part of this year when the LTMP 2018 is announced.</p>
                                          <p>thatâ€™s what I thought I heard over the radio yesterday, but when I looked at the internet, I couldnâ€™t find anything about it. so most probably Iâ€™m imagining things.</p>
