              Street 61/71/81/82. At least increase the frequency of 258, or
              create a short working trip of 243 which loops at Pioneer

              <p>1. 43 cannot do Marine Terrace on its way to UEC Ter, because you cannot turn right from Marine Terrace to Marine Parade Rd (towards Bedok). Same as 13/16/196 now. 76 can ply the whole stretch of Marine Terrace because it loops there and bring people back to PP/Paya Lebar.</p>
              <p>2. Even if you amend 43, there is still no direct connection to AMK Ave 3 / AMK Hub / Mayflower / YCK.</p>

              <p>1. 43 cannot do Marine Terrace on its way to UEC Ter, because
                      you cannot turn right from Marine Terrace to Marine Parade Rd
                      (towards Bedok). Same as 13/16/196 now. 76 can ply the whole
                      stretch of Marine Terrace because it loops there and bring people
                      back to PP/Paya Lebar.</p>
              <p>2. Even if you amend 43, there is still no direct connection to
                      AMK Ave 3 / AMK Hub / Mayflower / YCK.</p>

              <p>In relation to your second point, I am wondering how many people would want to go to Ang Mo Kio directly from Marine Terrace or vice versa...surely it cannot be the full amount of seats in an SD at any one time, let alone higher figures right? Most passengers would have already alighted en route, such as workplaces in Upp Paya Lebar. Even for Parkway Parade, there is 135 as an alternative...since the advice to transfer to 135 was there when 76 was amended years ago to loop at Marine Terrace instead of Victoria School.</p>

              <p>Let me make this clear. I am only targetting the point about the link to Ang Mo Kio which I feel that the explaination is not convincing. I am not siding with anyone as to whether 76 should be shortened to Eunos or retain its route to Marine Terrace. For your case I do agree with you that the frequency for the second alternative is insufficient to cater to the relatively middle lengthy portion of the route.</p>

              <p>I dont see 76 from PL onwards filled with elderly wor! I only know the ah mas and a<span style="line-height: 1.231;">h kongs who head to the nearest NTUC or park in their daily lives. Or do I know too little? Why would there suddenly be A LOT of elderly taking long dist 76? In general also quite little alr, leave alone elderly-specific?</span></p>
              <p>You want talk elderly? Oh I know! Got a lot at THK Hosp! Where 76 is the fastest way to the MRT! Oh and guess what, it is three stops from int! Meaning coz of selfish fools like you these poor elderly must wait for ages on cold hard benches coz a bus, having gone through nearly the full loop, often take 20+ mins to arrive!!! So who's the one helping the elderly?</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS6853S, hope everybody sees the importance of providing
              direct up to doorstep service in this sbs 76 episode. Not everybody
              prefers to transfer buses. As for the aged population, they don't
              like changes to something which is in place for so long. Cheers.
              Thanks. </p>

              <p>Most of the elderly go PP for their groceries. 134 does more than exactly that by providing reliable freq. I doubt many of them even venture so far into whatever places you name.</p>

              <p>43 is definitely not enough as the distance between the bus
                      stops along Marine Parade Road and Marine Terrace is extremely far
                      in the point of view of the aging population in Marine Terrace.</p>
              <p>They may also be inconvenienced by having their travel time
                      delayed due to prolonged waiting times during transfers.</p>
              <p>Also, if you do not understand the situation well enough, please
                      do not comment.</p>

              <p>So you think you understand very well??</p>
              <p>You know all the elderly very eng! All carry binoculars and hitch tents and begin th<span style="line-height: 1.231;">eir saga to AMK and worse still, Tai Seng!!</span></p>
              <p>I know you rly wanna show your ignorance off but it's best kept to yourself la ah</p>
              <p>I can guarantee you, the time waiting for transfer is much shorter than the time waiting for the damn 76 in the first place! </p>
              <p>Thought you regular commuter? If you are even one in the first place? Simple general knowledge such as bunching on 76 also dont know?!</p>
              <p>If you asking those "not knowing situation" not to comment I think you better not too.</p>
