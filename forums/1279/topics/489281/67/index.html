              <p>Here is what I think of everything:</p>
              <p>If 14 &amp; 147 are amended, 146 will be introduced to cover 14
              since it is an important part of the route.</p>
              <p>147 is to be amended to terminate at Marina South ITH, keeping
              its route between Bukit Merah &amp; Clementi unchanged; the route
              towards Hougang will be withdrawned and replaced by 152 from New
              Bridge Rd Ter to Hougang to increase reliability of 147. 153 also
              go to Hougang from nearby. Also introduce 110 running between
              Marina South ITH &amp; Sengkang/Buangkok to serve the needs of
              Sengkang residents</p>
              <p>Basically the amendment of 147 is the very same amendment of 76
              previously</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Since LTA had the initial intention to cut 147 up to Marina Centre during the NEL rationalization, won't they feel hesitant to even introduce this proposed 152 to replace the sectors that "heavily duplicate the NEL"? Just my two cents.</p>

              <p>I like your idea for this. However this route serves the YIS industries which is not good for the balance between the residents and the workers. I have 887 which enters the 'outside' Canberra then into YIS industries for this, while 888 enters inside Canberra then to Yishun via KTPH. How about it?</p>

              <p>857 is a semi-express service much like 190 and 700 (when it was WDL to Marina Centre/Shenton Way)</p>
              <p>Airport bound services used to be bi-directional. The problem with old 989 was its length. The removal of 989 prompts the issue of missing direct links.</p>
              <p>Looping trunk services would be amended into bi-directional routes. There is possibility that 965 will terminate at Sengkang Int when Sengkang Int is expanded. However, short trunks that loops will not be affected. For Airport and Cross border services, they will not affected.</p>

              <p>I hope you observe 14 on weekends. In addition, there's already 10 from East Coast Rd to Shenton Way and 196 from Mountbatten Rd to Shenton Way. And just because more people are going to Shenton Way during peak hours, this doens't mean that their direct link to Orchard can be removed so easily.</p>

              <p>Here is what I think of everything:</p>
              <p>If 14 &amp; 147 are amended, 146 will be introduced to cover 14
              since it is an important part of the route.</p>
              <p>147 is to be amended to terminate at Marina South ITH, keeping
              its route between Bukit Merah &amp; Clementi unchanged; the route
              towards Hougang will be withdrawned and replaced by 152 from New
              Bridge Rd Ter to Hougang to increase reliability of 147. 153 also
              go to Hougang from nearby. Also introduce 110 running between
              Marina South ITH &amp; Sengkang/Buangkok to serve the needs of
              Sengkang residents</p>
              <p>Basically the amendment of 147 is the very same amendment of 76
              previously</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When it comes to long-distance services passing through the city, I don't quite agree with splitting up them using 76's approach, which is just breaking up the route at one point (in 76's case, Paya Lebar) and separate into two services.</p>
              <p>76 works this way (or forumers here think it does) because demand is "only" from Paya Lebar MRT to Marine Parade. In the worst case, there's still 43 for those travelling beyond Paya Lebar. That's not the case for most city services (such as 147, 14 or even 51 that have been in the discussion these days), where commuters often take one service to multiple destinations in the city.</p>
              <p>That's why I don't agree with simply separating 147 at NBR/Chinatown.</p>

              even introduce this proposed 152 to replace the sectors that

              <p>Huh? What are you talking about? None of 7, 14, 147 and any other service mentioned in this subtopic serve Bt Batok or Toh Guan.

              <p>How about extending 67 and 149 (east side) to St. Michaels / Toa Payoh? 149 on the west side can also be extended to BBDEP / Bt Batok Int to free up Clementi, as is oft discussed earlier.</p>
              <p>Also, I feel that there can be a bus terminal along Bt Timah Rd (between Sixth Ave and Newton), or along Adam Rd / north Farrer Rd / east Holland Rd. This sector is plied by many buses, has abundant space and is far away from any nearby bus interchange / terminal.</p>

              <p><strong>833A</strong> can loop at Canberra MRT, then loop back
              via Canberra View --&gt; Crescent --&gt; Way.</p>
              <p>A future route amendment of 169 to serve Canberra Walk and
              Canberra Crescent will be enough to take care of that side, with
              117/833 covering the skipped sectors.</p>
              <p>In this way all three MRT stations are served, and those living
              / working along Yishun Ave 7 and Ave 9 will have an alternative MRT
              link to Canberra and do not need to rely solely on 811. Sembawang
              Drive residents can also get easier access to Yishun and KTPH.</p>
              <p>(Am using the number 833, just to facilitate a possible future
              scenario of the renumbering of 980/981/882 to 830/831/832. This is
              tentative, of course.)</p>

              <p>I think it's better to loop around Yishun Central than Yishun Int , Yishun int is looking quite congested? </p>

              <p>How about extending 67 and 149 (east side) to St. Michaels / Toa
              Payoh? 149 on the west side can also be extended to BBDEP / Bt
              Batok Int to free up Clementi, as is oft discussed earlier.</p>
              <p>Also, I feel that there can be a bus terminal along Bt Timah Rd
              (between Sixth Ave and Newton), or along Adam Rd / north Farrer Rd
              / east Holland Rd. This sector is plied by many buses, has abundant
              space and is far away from any nearby bus interchange /
              terminal.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, actually we should really congratulate those who apply for the positions in LTA and get the job and did the required proposed route suggestions/modifications/amendments such as the guy who tweaked the sbs 76 route. At least the guy takes the plunge and WALK THE TALK even though his amendment is not popular. However he is willing to take such a role as his job. Unlike all of us here who just merely suggests here and there and gets rebuttal and gets into a shooting war in the end. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
