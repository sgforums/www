              <p>To be realistic, the sectors of sv61 in the Eastern part of Singapore (Eunos, Ubi, MacPherson, Kallang Bahru) doesn't have very significant demand due to the following possible reasons.</p>
              <p>Firstly, sv61 duplicates a large portion of sv63, first between Eunos Int and MacPherson Est and later between Lavender and Chinatown. sv63 usually has more frequent arrivals at Eunos Int, which results in more commuters choosing sv63 over sv61. With the conversion of sv63M to a full day sv in 2014, this likelihood is even higher now.</p>
              <p>Unless the diversion to Shenton Way Ter can improve the scheduled frequency of sv61 significantly, the competition between sv61 and sv63 will likely continue and sv61 would likely continue to be at a disadvantage in the east.</p>
              <p>In addition, sv154 also provides connections between Eunos Int and MacPherson Est, though with less frequent arrivals as well due to its relatively lengthy route. It also links MacPherson Rd with Eunos Int like sv61 (unsure about the demand of this connection so I'll not elaborate further).</p>
              <p>The western sectors of sv61 are really the ones with more significant passenger demand, especially between Bt Batok Int and NP/SIM. Adding on the fact that it is the only bus along the southern leg of C'wealth Dr. So sv991 will likely do well if your suggestion materialized.</p>
              <p>The eastern sectors of sv61 should either be slightly modified to be less duplicative of sv63 or truncated fully. Nevertheless, sv61 does have 1 advantage over sv63 at this point, which is its ability to run double-deck buses while the latter is unable to due to Jln Rumah Tinggi. Maybe more SD-&gt;DD upgrades for sv61 to see if it can win over sv63 may suffice if sv61 has to remain as it is along its eastern sectors.</p>

              <p>I don't quite agree. If you see sv 61 has DDs timed for PM peak at UBI/Macpherson to city. During 5.30-6.30pm sv 61 can easily get 60-80 pax in this sector as it is the only service from UBI/Macpherson connecting to nearby Geylang Bahru and Kallang town. </p>
              <p>The loading in city area upto Clementi road on sv 61 is dismissal/okay because of multiple parallel services. Again Clementi Road to Bukit Batok, sv 61 has heavy loading. </p>
              <p>61 should be chopped as it is highly inefficient. The high capacity bus deployment on 61 is inefficient because by the time it reaches Ngee Ann, the peak hour is over. </p>

              <p>61 does provide a number of unique connections in the east, such

              <p>Unique is unique, I think by DTL is completed, Ubi, Macpherson, Geylang Bahru will have direct link even to the city. <br>So most likely 61 will either be amended OR will be like 67 to cover some lost link for the MRT.  Depends on what LTA is going to deal with 61.</p>

              <p>I don't quite agree. If you see sv 61 has DDs timed for PM peak
                  at UBI/Macpherson to city. During 5.30-6.30pm sv 61 can easily get
                  60-80 pax in this sector as it is the only service from
                  UBI/Macpherson connecting to nearby Geylang Bahru and Kallang
                  town. </p>
              <p>The loading in city area upto Clementi road on sv 61 is
                  dismissal/okay because of multiple parallel services. Again
                  Clementi Road to Bukit Batok, sv 61 has heavy loading. </p>
              <p>61 should be chopped as it is highly inefficient. The high
                  capacity bus deployment on 61 is inefficient because by the time it
                  reaches Ngee Ann, the peak hour is over. </p>

              <p>61 ideally should be split BB &gt; Buona Vista (if space permits), Kent Ridge &gt; Marine Centre/future MS ITH (supplementary service and will connect Commonwealth directly with NUS faculty side), Marina Centre/future MS ITH &gt; Eunos. </p>

              <p>Good suggestion, Whampoa sector is useful. I like that Chai Chee is linked to the DTL at Bedok North, but a little bit duplicative of 229 at Bedok South. Would suggest terminating this service at Eunos so that then it also links Geylang Serai with Chai Chee and Bedok North. </p>

              <p>I'm no resident of the northeast, but here are my views:</p>
              <p>Cross-country express services that pass through the CBD aren't popular now, with City Directs <a href="/forums/1279/topics/467373?page=54#post_11151493">doing a better job</a> of connecting the residential towns to the city. In addition, the route would be too long and prone to bunching and delays if demand is unevenly distributed.</p>
              <p>Consider a direct Sengkang - CBD express, or a route from Sengkang to the west via Hougang / AMK / Lornie Rd / Adam Rd and not passing through the CBD. Don't touch 502 anymore, it's quite well established.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs 9256X, route is not too bad. There will be some who wants to go orchard and some who wants to go Marina area. You cannot please everybody. So to alleviate the long journey, you just need delete some sectors like Ang mo kio Ave 1, boundary road, yio Chu Kang road, Hougang Ave 8/10 sectors to make it faster. This will help those who take the sbs 502 but need to go orchard area. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, normally such requests will not be granted. If LTA accedes to every Tom, Dick or Harry's request, then you see almost frequent bus routes amendments week after week and there will be no end. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
