              <p>For Bukit Merah, as well as the other old towns, the areas which need new bus service usually have at least one new estate of HDB flats.

If we include the new BTO "Depot Heights" (Q3 2016) nearby at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Depot Road</span></strong>, which has 418 units, this would mean that 2390 new residential units are coming up in Bukit Merah.

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, yes you are half right. For telok blangah heights/telok blangah street 32 (not 31), they have already implemented sbs 120 and amended Sbs 124 slightly in the previous round. Sbs 120 loading can still be improved and it connects people to telok blangah MRT station. However from what I know, people still prefer to walk down to the nearby telok blangah Mrt. This area is well bounded by roads with many buses which is a common sight in mature estates. Telok blangah road (10, 30, 51, 61, 93, 97, 97e,100, 120, 143, 166, 176, 188R, 188, 963R, 963) and Henderson road (124, 131, 145, 176, 273, 408) have an alavanche of buses. For those residents who cannot walk out, both roads are assisted by sbs 120 to transfer to other buses. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>For Bukit Merah, as well as the other old towns, the areas which
              need new bus service usually have at least one new estate of HDB
              flats. As mentioned previously (refer to my reply last Sunday), I
              think a new bus service is needed when an area (or a town) has more
              than two thousand new residential units coming up. There are
              websites which compile the number of units a new HDB estate
              has.</p>
              <p>In the case of Bukit Merah, the area which may needs new bus
              service is at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Telok Blangah Heights</span></strong> / <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Telok Blangah
              Street 31</strong></span>, where new BTOs "Telok Blangah Ridgeview"
              (Q1 2016) and "Telok Blangah ParcView" (Q4 2017) will have 492
              units and 1480 units respectively, total 1972 new units. If we
              include the new BTO "Depot Heights" (Q3 2016) nearby at
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Depot
              Road</span></strong>, which has 418 units, this would mean that
              2390 new residential units are coming up in Bukit Merah. I think it
              is this part of Bukit Merah that needs a new bus service.</p>

              for 2 condos side by side near to plaza) (only 50 for Riverparc
              residence at the far end near waterway primary school)? There
              should be more than 1000 units for the 3 condos. Cheers.
              Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, I know. What I mean is a bit sarcastic as mr gekpohboy keeps saying new flats should have new bus services. Thus there are 3 condos in Punggol east so it must be comparable to have new bus services. I wish to highlight that we must look at the existing bus services on nearby roads before we keep saying must introduce new bus services for new flats. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Extension of 92:</p>
              <p>- Find a proper terminal for this service (although Ghim Moh is
              still ok)</p>
              <p>- More transfer options for Science Park workers</p>
              <p>- Connects Queenstown MRT with Jln Bt Merah (western stretch)
              and Alexandra Rd (IKEA, helping 195)</p>
              <p>- Possible operation on Sun/PH and extension of operation
              hours</p>
              <p>- Extension to Clementi Int was also suggested frequently but I
              doubt it has any space for a new service</p>
              <p>Amendment of 63 &amp; 64:</p>
              <p>- Find a proper terminal for these 2 services (especially 64),
              to improve reliability and reduce bunching (although 63 already has
              short layover at Rumah Tinggi)</p>
              <p>- I tried my best to retain the original routes as much as
              possible</p>
              <p>- Connect residents to Bukit Merah Central</p>
              <p>- Red and white plates to be used for both services</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think you can make 92 terminate at a terminal like what the other user said about making it to meet with the other 4 services where it also connects with Buona Vista MRT as well. I dont think there is a need to extend to Clementi as from Ulu Pandan Rd, you can take 7 to get there. I dont think many people along Pandan Valley and Clementi Ave 2 would bother having a bus service at their area as from both areas, it is just at least an 8 min walk to get onboard 7/walk to Clementi MRT. I am not sure what to do with Blk 46 and the terminal there though</p></div>
