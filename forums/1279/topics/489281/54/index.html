              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Route extension to bus service 181.</span></strong></p>
                                      <p>I would like to propose a route extension to existing bus service 181.</p>
                                      <p>Currently, bus service 181 runs between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Jurong West Avenue 3, and loops at the turnabout space at the end of Jurong West Avenue 3. It connects people between Jurong West Avenue 3 and Jurong West Street 75 and 64. It complements bus services 172 and 199 to connect people staying along Jurong West Avenue 3 to Boon Lay MRT Station. It complements bus service 243 to connect people staying along Jurong West Street 75 and 64 to Boon Lay MRT Station. Bus Service 181 is popular among the people who live, work and play in the Gek Poh neighbourhood of Jurong West.</p>
                                      <p>I feel that bus service 181 has the potential to provide more bus connections for people in the Gek Poh neighbourhood, and serve more areas in Jurong West.</p>
                                      <p>As of now, MRT Chinese Garden station is under-utilised; few people use the station, and only two bus services 180 and 335 connect to the station. Meanwhile, Jurong West Avenue 3 is in a location where MRT Boon Lay station is not exactly the nearest MRT station.</p>
                                      <p>It would be good if we can extend the route of bus service 181 to connect Hong Kah neighbourhood and Jurong West Avenue 3 to MRT Chinese Garden station. This would encourage more people to use MRT Chinese Garden station, enhance the public transport connection between Jurong West Avenue 3 and the rest of the island, and enhance the bus connection between Jurong West Street 64 and 75, and Jurong West Avenue 1.</p>
                                      <p>If the extended route of bus service 181 is short and travel times are comparable to that on existing public transport routes available for the above-mentioned connections, it would encourage the people to switch to bus service 181, thus relieve the loading off existing public transport routes.</p>
                                      <p>In my proposed extension, bus service 181 turns right after Jurong West Avenue 3 and extends from Jurong West Street 22 towards MRT Chinese Garden station; it turns left after Jurong West Street 22 and continues on Jurong West Avenue 3 towards Boon Lay Bus Interchange. No bus stop is skipped.</p>
                                      <p>From Jurong West Street 22 to MRT Chinese Garden station and back, the route is as follows,</p>
                                      <p>Jurong West Street 22 &gt; Jurong West Street 23 &gt; Jurong West Avenue 2 &gt; Corporation Road &gt; Jurong West Avenue 1 &gt; Jurong East Avenue 1 &gt; Jurong Town Hall Road &gt; Boon Lay Way (<strong>MRT Chinese Garden station</strong>) &gt; Jurong East Street 31 &gt; Jurong East Avenue 1 &gt; Jurong West Avenue 1 &gt; Corporation Road &gt; Jurong West Avenue 2 &gt; Jurong West Street 23 &gt; Jurong West Street 22.</p>
                                      <p>The current length of bus service 181 is 6.4 kilometres and the travel time is 38 minutes. The extended length is 9.48 kilometres and travelling to MRT Chinese Garden station and back takes 15 to 42 minutes; the extension would increase the length of bus service 181 to 15.88 kilometres (6.4 + 9.48) and increase the travel time to 80 minutes (38 + 42). As such, the bus fleet on service 181 has to increase by 111%, from the 6 buses it has now to 13 buses; 7 more buses.</p>
                                      <p>Today, the bus connections between Jurong West Street 64 and Jurong East Avenue 1 are very popular, especially during peak hours when double decker buses on bus services have high amounts of loading. Although there is already a short-working trip of bus service 198 running from Boon Lay Bus Interchange to Jurong East Avenue 1 during morning peak hours, I feel that there is room for improvement. The extension of bus service 181 to Jurong East Avenue 1 would enhance the bus connection between Jurong West Street 64 and Jurong East Avenue 1.</p>
                                      <p>Today, the fastest route from MRT Chinese Garden station to Jurong West Avenue 3 is provided by the MRT East-West Line with a transfer at MRT Boon Lay station to bus service 181. The distance travelled is 6.6 kilometres and the journey takes 39 minutes (including 15 minutes of transfer). With the extension, one can transfer to bus service 181 from the MRT East-West Line at MRT Chinese Garden station and get to Jurong West Avenue 3 in 54 minutes (including 15 minutes of transfer), with the distance travelled at only 4.85 kilometres. At least there is a saving of 1.75 kilometres (6.6 â€“ 4.85).</p>
                                      <p>Today, the fastest route from MRT Jurong East station to Jurong Canal area is provided by bus service 334, which is 3.1 kilometres and takes up to 34 minutes (including 15 minutes of transfer) to travel from Jurong East Bus Interchange to Jurong Canal area. With the extension, one can take the MRT up by one stop to MRT Chinese Garden station and take bus service 181 to get to Jurong Canal area in 21 minutes (including 15 minutes of transfer), with the distance travelled at only 2.93km! This is a saving of 13 minutes (34 â€“ 21) and 0.17 kilometres (3.1 â€“ 2.93).</p>
                                      <p>The extension of bus service 181 enhances the public transport connection between the Gek Poh neighbourhood and Hong Kah neighbourhood in Jurong West. It provides a faster and shorter alternative for travel between the MRT and Jurong Canal area, and provides a shorter alternative for travel between the MRT and Jurong West Avenue 3. If introduced, I believe it will be well-received by the people in Jurong West.</p>

                      improvement. The extension of bus service 181 to Jurong East Avenue
                      1 would enhance the bus connection between Jurong West Street 64

                      travelled is 6.6 kilometres and the journey takes 41 minutes
                      (including transfer). With the extension, one can transfer to bus
                      service 181 from the MRT East-West Line at MRT Chinese Garden
                      station and get to Jurong West Avenue 3 in 37 minutes (including 5
                      minutes of transfer), with the distance travelled at only 4.85
                      kilometres! This is a saving of 4 minutes (41 – 37) and 1.75
                      kilometres (6.6 – 4.85).</p>
              <p>Today, the fastest route from MRT Jurong East station to Jurong
                      Canal area is provided by bus service 334, which is 3.1 kilometres
                      and takes up to 24 minutes (including 5 minutes of transfer) to
                      travel from Jurong East Bus Interchange to Jurong Canal area. With
                      the extension, one can take the MRT up by one stop to MRT Chinese
                      Garden station and take bus service 181 to get to Jurong Canal area
                      in 13 minutes (including 5 minutes of transfer), with the distance
                      travelled at only 2.93km! This is a saving of 11 minutes (24 – 13)
                      and 0.17 kilometres (3.1 – 2.93).</p>
              <p>The extension of bus service 181 enhances the public transport
                      connection between the Gek Poh neighbourhood and Hong Kah
                      neighbourhood in Jurong West. It provides a shorter and faster
                      alternative to existing public transport routes from the MRT to
                      Jurong Canal area and Jurong West Avenue 3. If introduced, I
                      believe it will be well-received by the people in Jurong West.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Unfortunately this is a bit far-fetched. Based on east-west alignment, Boon Lay is still the nearest MRT station for Jurong West Ave 3 / St 23 residents. Extending to Lakeside is already straining for the route. Let alone Chinese Garden.</p>
              <p>As for the stretch of Jurong East Ave 1, aside from 198, there is still 157/187 to share the load to Boon Lay. Don't need 181. Link between Jurong West Ave 3 and Jurong East Ave 1 is also already covered by 185.</p>

              <p>Indeed I don't. But. From the points you have mentioned above, you talked about (1) the potential extendability of 181; (2) the need for services from Boon Lay to Jurong East Ave 1; (3) the need for new links between Jurong West Ave 3 and a non-Boon Lay MRT station; (4) improving the links from Jurong Canal to MRT station by introducing a route to Chinese Garden MRT; and (5) improving the links from Gek Poh neighbourhood to other areas of Jurong West.</p>
              <p>I acknowledge (1), as well as your efforts to extend it, but I don't really get why you're letting the extension follow so much of 185's route. I cannot comprehend (2), because 157 and 187 from/to Boon Lay are already there alongside 198. (3) is a potential issue, though I am unaware of its magnitude, as well as how much 185 mitigates it. For (4), there is 198 to Chinese Garden MRT already, albeit not directly. I shall not comment further on (5) as you would undoubtly have contemplated that countless times, though I feel that 258's utilization can be improved.</p>

              <p>198 doesn't really call at Chinese Garden MRT and I doubt people will be willing to take 198 from there, hence (4) is valid. In fact, Chinese Garden is one of the most under-utilised MRT stations with regards to bus transfers, and has much greater potential to connect to other places. Though I agree that extending 181 is probably not the best choice.</p>

              <p>My take on the Eunos-MP route</p>
              <p>Amendment of Svc 853 to Eunos</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Some users have been menrioning amending Svc 15 to Stadium. Here is my take.</p>
              <p>Current Rt to Still Rd</p>
              <p>Still Rd Sth, MP Rd, Amber Rd, Mountbatten Rd</p>
              <p>Fort Rd, Tg Rhu Rd (Dunman High), Stadium Cres (Stadium MRT), Stadium Walk</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>853 lost sector can be covered by 107 from Potong Pasir to Kallang Bahru, 26 from Kallang Bahru to Sims Ave, 40 from Sims Ave to Tg Katong, and 43 from Tg Katong to UEC</p>
              <p>853 also connects Upp S'goon with Jln Kolam Ayer, where pax can transfer to and fro 23 and 966 there.</p>
              <p>853 cover 15 sector in Telok Kurau, and also connects it to Eunos MRT directly.</p>
              <p>Its full SD fleet and average frequency makes it ideal for these low-catchment areas, and tight roads.</p>
              <p>15 lost its Tao Nan bus stop, but its amended bus stop at Still Rd Sth is a short walk.</p>
              <p>Skipping Telok Kurau, 15 can deploy HC buses.</p>
              <p>The rt also connects MP/Mountbatten/Stadium MRT with Dunman High, giving students an alternative to 158.</p>

              <p>Why are you so confident that your proposed 121 is the best alternative? I think you need to justify because I saw your route and I did not see such a huge value in it. </p>
              <p>121 is mainly to connect Ganges to Tiong Bahru and Tehlok Blangah to Tiong Bahru.</p>
              <p>I am supportive of extending 121 to Marina Center Terminal but not beyond as it will lead to unpredictable schedules for the Tiong Bahru sector for which it has been introduced in first place.</p>

              <p>I am okay with there being express service bet Sengkang/Punggol to city to places that are not covered by NEL to provide direct link. But 80e is really not the right number.</p>
              <p>sv 80 main loading is between Aljunied - Geylang East Central - Paya Lebar - Kovan. The 80e doesn't really serve the purpose. The loading on sv 80 bet Aljunied and Harbourfront largely depends on the timing of other services that largely duplicate its route, not to mention sv 145 that follows same route from Lavendar to HF at 05-07 mins frequency. </p>

              <p>Alright, since you request for it</p>
              <p>It seems to duplicate all the 3 Mountbatten routes (14 and 196 to Suntec/Nicoll Highway, and 12 serve the Chinatown area well already). It might be viable if it plys Shenton/Maxwell instead of Chinatown, and also, it will fight for pax with 196. BA also point out that it is like a feeder around the Tiong Bahru area. During peak hours, the buses will be affected by jams, and its important catchment at Tiong Bahru will be affected badly.</p>
              <p>Your suggestion bought up a point though. There are currently no connections from Mountbatten to Paya Lebar/Eunos. Nearest for east bound requires a transfer to 40/15/966/32 along EC Rd/Parkway area.</p>

              <p>Not necessary when you have service 30 from Fort Rd/Kg Arang to both Paya Lebar &amp; Eunos. Not to mention the presence of Mountbatten MRT which is served by all routes along Mountbatten; 12, 14 and 196. Pax can transfer at Paya Lebar MRT for eastern destinations. With all honesty, ea<span style="line-height: 1.231;">stbound demand from Mountbatten will be limited with the exception of Katong/Marine Parade (served by 12, 14 &amp; 196) or CBP (12/14 then transfer to 47 at East Coast Rd). So really, it's quite sufficient. Even 196 to Bedok is quite direct. </span></p>

              <p>To be honest I don't wish to see any more bus services using PIE (52's sector), especially for those exiting at Lornie Rd.</p>
              <p>The exit is very often jammed, even when the PIE main road is doing fine. As a result 52 is often stuck there... Honesly even plying Dunearn Rd / Bt Timah Rd express may still be faster.</p>
              <p>Maybe when the new road from MacRitchie to Adam Rd flyover is up, then the traffic can be smoother. But now, no.</p>
