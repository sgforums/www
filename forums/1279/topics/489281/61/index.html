              <p>- Connection between Pasir Ris West and Tampines West, which I think is an important connection missing between these 2 towns</p>
              <p>   - Pasir Ris West residents to IKEA / Temasek Poly</p>
              <p>   - Tampines residents to Meridian JC</p>
              <p>- Serves Pasir Ris Grove without introducing a short feeder service</p>
              <p>   - Plies Pasir Ris Grove in the same direction both from &amp; to Pasir Ris Int</p>
              <p>   - Red/white plates to be used</p>
              <p>   - Note: Supposed to use Dr 8 towards interchange instead of Pasir Ris Central, but somehow it's not feasible on Google Maps</p>
              <p>- Serves Pasir Ris St 72 &amp; Tampines St 86, both without services today (although I feel that eventually Tampines St 86 will get a new feeder)</p>
              <p>- Relieve 15's load between Tampines MRT (@ Ave 4) and Temasek Poly</p>
              <p>- Serves Tampines N4 (St 42, 43, Ave 9), at bus stops where there's no service, has only unidirectional 293 (too winding from interchange), or only served by 28 and 29 which can be packed to the door</p>
              <p>- Also functions as townlink between Tampines East and Tampines West</p>
              <p>- IMO this is much better than just looping 68 at Tampines Ave 4</p>

              <p>Leaving sv41 as the only link between Jurong East and Upp Bt Timah Rd/Jln Anak Bt is not really the issue here. There's also sv66 by the way.</p>
              <p>As an ex-NP student, you need to realize that many students like me use the opp Bt Timah Plaza stop along Jln Anak Bt as an exchange point to transfer to sv52/61/75/184 to get to school. During the morning peak hours, sv61/75/184 are often packed to the door, resulting in the buses rejecting many pax. sv61 DDs happen not to show up at that time period, thus most of the sv61 buses that arrive at that timing are A22s, while sv75 operates full fleet A22s, which are obviously packed to the door as well. Even though sv184 has a majority fleet of articulated buses, even the articulated buses are also packed to the door. Therefore, sv52 appears to be the only "hope" to be able to get onto the bus, even if it's an SD (the SD may arrive packed but there's still room for boarding) If it's a DD, even better, given that there's ample of space to board.</p>
              <p>While you may argue that the students can just walk (more of a choice for NP students and not really a choice for SIM students given that their campus is slightly further away) to school or the BCs should attempt to at least ask the pax on the packed buses of sv61/75/184 to move in further to allow boarding (doesn't work most of the time), most NP/SIM students still prefer transferring buses at opp Bt Timah Plaza than walking and the fully packed buses usually fail to allow more pax to board. Therefore, sv52 is quite a critical alternative there that has more room to allow students transferring buses at the stop to get to school, given that sv61/75/184 would arrive full house at the stop most of the time and reject any pax transferring buses there.</p>
              <p>Another way will be, of course, to really step up the deployment of high capacity buses on sv61 and start deploying double-deck buses for sv184 (which many in this forum apparently reject) so that sv52 will become a less critical alternative and can be amended away from Jln Anak Bt/Upp Bt Timah Rd.</p>
              <p>With regards to evening peak, all 4 transferring buses (sv52/61/75/184) between NP/SIM and Shell Kiosk along Upp Bt Timah Rd would be packed to the brim, so I don't have comments on the loading during evening peak hours.</p>

              <p>Leaving sv41 as the only link between Jurong East and Upp Bt
                      Timah Rd/Jln Anak Bt is not really the issue here. There's also
                      sv66 by the way.</p>
              <p>As an ex-NP student, you need to realize that many students like
                      me use the opp Bt Timah Plaza stop along Jln Anak Bt as an exchange
                      point to transfer to sv52/61/75/184 to get to school. During the
                      morning peak hours, sv61/75/184 are often packed to the door,
                      resulting in the buses rejecting many pax. sv61 DDs happen not to
                      show up at that time period, thus most of the sv61 buses that
                      arrive at that timing are A22s, while sv75 operates full fleet
                      A22s, which are obviously packed to the door as well. Even though
                      sv184 has a majority fleet of articulated buses, even the
                      articulated buses are also packed to the door. Therefore, sv52
                      appears to be the only "hope" to be able to get onto the bus, even
                      if it's an SD (the SD may arrive packed but there's still room for
                      boarding) If it's a DD, even better, given that there's ample of
                      space to board.</p>
              <p>While you may argue that the students can just walk (more of a

                      of the time), most NP/SIM students still prefer transferring buses

              <p>Ok thanks. Didn't really think of this.</p>
              <p>Guess the only way to solve 52's congestion issue at PIE is to wait for the road through Bukit Brown to be completed...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alternatively, they can just extend 41 to loop at somewhere along Clementi Rd, although there does not seem to be such a good junction to make a U-turn. (I remember last time someone was complaining about a 75A bus making a U-turn)</p>
              <p>Hopefully after the expansion of Clementi Rd that would be feasible.</p>

              <p>Honestly sometimes i even wonder if LTA bus route planning department actually go out there to survey commuters about their opinions and travelling patterns when they plan bus routes. Amending Sv 76 will cause marine terrace residents a huge amount of inconvenience. It's like forcing people to transfer buses even when there isn't a need to. </p>
              <p>I really feel 76's amendment is a bad call. But to be fair I have waited 26minutes for Sv 76 at marine terrace before so this might improve its reliability.</p>
              <p>Next will be 135 and 155 liao. Hope it wouldnt be amended to Eunos/Bedok Int or else it'll only be 43 tanking the load from paya lebar mrt stn towards marine parade.</p>
              <p>853C should operate daily the way like how 70M operates</p>

Pioneer MRT opened for more than seven years already, but until now, there is no reliable bus service to connect Pioneer MRT to Jurong West Street 61/71/81/82.
