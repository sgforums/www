              <p>Why terminate 95 at Clementi? Your intention is for the residents or for the students population?</p>
              <p>96 already connect Clementi to Kent Ridge. The 95 extension would only add to the jams in Clementi and result in more unpredictable waiting time. The student population can always take the NUS internal shuttle bus from the Kent Ridge terminal to other parts of NUS. And for non-residents in Clementi, they always have the MRT options to Kent Ridge available.</p>
              <p>Did you forget about 198 that ply along AYE? That serves NUS/NUH too.</p>
              <p>Clementi is already well connected, adding more bus services may deteriorate the traffic conditions there, an important factor to consider, when thinking on putting more bus services there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You probably wanted 92 to be extended into Clementi too.</p>

              <p>Sembawang Int is bulit to better manage services in the area.
                  This interchange has no feeder services. However, the small amount
                  of services may need to expand fast. BSEP has added 117, 859B and
                  882A. It has also modified 859A. The upcoming Canberra sub-divison
                  will also need services.</p>
              <p>I have no idea how much more it would take before exploding.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>With regards to the above.</p>
              <p>Essentially 859 still exists because of the link between western Sembawang (Sembawang Cres / Dr / Admiralty Dr) and Yishun. If we patch that up, it'll save a lot of trouble.</p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion A:</strong> merge northern 811 and southern 859, number as 859. Current 859A/B convert to feeder, renumber as 879A/B. Southern 811 will now standalone as a feeder.</p>
              <p>What remains of <span style="color: #ff9900;">northern 811</span> and the <span style="color: #3366ff;">old 859</span> are all still served by 117 and 856.</p>
              <p>Pro: Western and northern Sembawang's links to Yishun would be preserved.</p>
              <p>Con: Direct link between Yishun Ave 5 &amp; 7, as well as north and south Yishun would be lost. May result in serious bunching problems. Also deteoriates Yishun Int's crowding problem, but this could be mitigated by diverting a Yishun trunk to do southern 811.</p>

              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion B:</strong> cut short 859's route in Sembawang and give 879A/B a major fleet boost for ease of transfer. 811 untouched.</p>

              <li><em>(loop back to Sembawang)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>812 can now be modified to do the new St 51 area (while preserving the link to Ave 4)<em>.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion C:</strong> Similar to A. Current 859A/B convert to feeder, renumber as 879A/B. Start 859 at Yishun and loop at Admiralty Link / Lane to preserve the link to Yishun (Canberra Rd already has 856). Extend one Yishun trunk to Sembawang <span style="text-decoration: underline;">via inner Canberra</span> to make up for the difference. (Preferrably 853 or 855, given Geylang &amp; Harbourfront's capability for a minor fleet add. Or 857, if it can terminate at Marina Centre or Shenton Way)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Suggestion D:</strong> Current 859A/B convert to feeder, renumber as 879A/B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remove 859. Introduce 856W</span>, variant of 856, to do lost sectors of 859 along Sembawang Cres, Admiralty Dr, Sembawang Dr &amp; Admiralty Link.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall, it is best to consider all of Sembawang, Canberra and Yishun as a whole multi-town system before making any route changes to improve efficiency, as any changes (particularly in Sembawang) will have quite some impacts on neighbouring towns.</p>

              <p>I think current new diversion for 301 is okay. Currently the loading on 301 is just good and as a back up service to 300/983. You don't see full buses unlike on 300/983 except for peak hours when the queue on 300/983 is long.</p>
              <p>This will give dedicated patronage for 301 for Keat Hong Close HDBs - we may see some fleet add as well to cater to this.</p>
              <p>At same time those from ave 5 will now prefer to take 983 even more given that 301 will loop around Keat Hong Close and will take more time.</p>
              <p>I feel the current CCK feeder/short trunk network is nicely done to cover the whole new town. Keat Hong Close HDBs will now have to walk to ave 5 to take bus to BPJ unlike before when 983 was also planned to call at Keat Hong Close.</p>

              <p>There won't be any change to 47 now since it is already introduced. We may have to observe a bit more carefully in coming months before we take a call on 47.

              <p>Even if confusing, I still support it. Currently, there is NO need for a service at Upper Serangoon View. 324 on most accounts gets 0 pax as the condo is under construction, school has access on Upp Serangoon road with sv 62, 102, 136. </p>
              <p>102 can ply Upp Serangoon Crescent bi-directional. Will save parking space and resources at HCI. 324 gets 20-25 pax during peak hours. Off peak is &lt;10 pax on most buses. 102 gets also 15-25 pax during peak hours from HCI. 102 with its DDs i enough to manage 40-50 pax from HCI to Upper Serangoon/Buangkok Dr. Even if a Citaro is plied, can still tank the load. </p>
              <p>Too much wasted resources and poor planning in launching 324.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Given that Punggol Interchange has no space, logical move for me is to use existing services to provide more connectivity.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Here's my proposal in the map:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zAHrqvntcAUY.k59D9gsEWJ7A&amp;usp=sharing</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">(1) 83 should be diverted to call at a stop in both directions along Edgedale Plains to serve HDB Edge. 83 will also do Compassalve Crescent with 2 new stops, nullyfing current one at Compassalve St to cater to Compassalve Broadwalk HDB that opens in same time frame. This will boost service 83 loading that today has dropped to a great extent. So existing service can be used in a more useful way.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">(2) Feeder 386 will call at a stop in both directions along Edgedale Plains end to cater to Sundew HDB. This will also connect Sundew like Banks/Ridges HDB along Edgefield Plains end to Punggol Plaza/Punggol Field to transfer to other services + basic amenities. No need new service as 386 has capacity to take on more loading. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I hope LTA considers to implement these 2 suggestions.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, sad to dampen your spirit. Don't think that will ever happen. LTA will most likely not divert 2 existing bus services to do this type of issues. The more logical way is to quickly start expanding Punggol bus interchange as soon as possible and get another feeder service to serve the edgedale plains end and also Punggol east end. </p>
              <p>Have they really so bothered about not introducing new services and only used existing services, they will not have introduced Sbs 382G/W. They will have used either sbs 117 or 118 to cover certain sectors of 382G/W plus amended Sbs 119 to cover a bit of 382G. Instead they realized the inconvenience posed and introduced a new service. </p>
              <p>Sbs 83 will definitely not go into edgedale plains end as it will cause great inconvenience. Sbs 386 still has chances to go in but then how many can you control? Sbs 386 goes into edgefield plains end currently and you want it go into edgedale plains end (just to avoid introducing new service and to maximize its loading). So how about Punggol east end??? There is also no bus there at the moment. Sbs 386 to go in as well? No right? If there are so many unserved roads and the time calls for a new service to be introduced, it has to be introduced. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Sorry but 119/117/118 cannot do what 382G/W does. It was required.</p>
              <p>Likewise 386 is required, but Edgedale Plains end gets only Sundew open in Q2 2016. Waterway View HDB opens only Q3 2017. New service for one HDB block?

              <p>As for Punggol East end, the HDB opens only in Q4 2017. Why even bother about it now? It is 2 years from now. I am speaking about changes that should happen in Q2 to better meet customer needs. Also I am editing services that have poor loading today and can meet commuter needs better.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, Sbs 117/118 can do what 382G/W does. Why not? Instead of turning into Punggol field, it goes straight into Punggol way then TPE then continue on normal journey. The only sector not covered will be Punggol field continued to be covered by Sbs 119. Who says why not??? It is just that they don't think it is appropriate. It will be much more convenient to introduce a new service. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">They are more prone to providing convenience than to make everybody go one round. </span></p>
              <p>With no disrespect to you, I have full confidence that they will reject your Sbs 83 proposal. It is going to provide a lot of inconvenience to Punggol central/east residents. The only thing that looks more probable is Sbs 386. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>All, please note Punggol bus interchange only has 26 parking lots. The numbers are clearly marked on the ground. It is up 2 from the previous 24. So please ignore all other numbers you see online. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongresident, mine is the most accurate. I observe the marking on the ground inside the interchange myself. Not using any websites. If there are really 38 parking lots for buses, then Punggol interchange will not be so cramped as what people say to be. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Yes you maybe right coz 38 parking slots is quite a lot. That's why I drew it out that there are so many empty spaces then. 24 is a bit short after 3 new service introductions.</p>
