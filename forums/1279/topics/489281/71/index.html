              <p>If want to split 198, actually can. No one (not many) people
                  actually takes 198 all the way from Boon Lay to Bukit Merah, or
                  from Bukit Merah to Boon Lay. It takes around two hours leh,
                  considering the jam and all the traffic lights. Most people, if not
                  all, would rather take MRT lor.</p>
              <p>If want split, I suggest shortening 198 to NUH, and then somehow
                  make it terminate at Kent Ridge Bus Terminal.</p>
              <p>The condition is that the new route replacing the skipped
                  section also serve NUH, somewhat duplicate 198 at NUH. So, it's
                  either the new route come from New Bridge Road Bus Terminal (or
                  Marina Centre or Shenton Way), recover the skipped section of 198
                  and loop around NUH, or the new route also start from Kent Ridge
                  Bus Terminal, go to NUH, recover the skipped section of 198 and
                  loop at the city area.</p>
              <p>Actually, I feel that it is better to do something to express
                  bus 502 instead. 502 is too long, and heavily duplicates 99 and
                  185. We can split 502 into many express routes, actually. One for
                  Jurong West Extension, One for Old Jurong West and Jurong East. We
                  can even have one for Taman Jurong and Teban Gardens, combined.</p>
              <p>I suggest a new 502 for Jurong West Extension. It follows the
                  current 502 route between Soon Lee Depot and Corporation Road. It
                  runs express along the PIE, Whitley Road and Stevens road. It
                  follows the current 502 route between Orchard Road and Shenton Way,
                  and then terminate at Shenton Way Bus Terminal. Same frequency as
                  current 502, except now can have more single decker buses than
                  double decker buses.</p>
              <p>I suggest a new express route for Old Jurong West and Jurong
                  East. It follows 157 route between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and
                  Jurong Town Hall Road, run until the end of Jurong East Avenue 1,
                  run express along PIE and CTE, somehow meander through the CBD and
                  then terminate at a bus terminal in the CBD. Same frequency as 502.
                  Majority single decker, with some double decker.</p>
              <p>I suggest a new express route for Taman Jurong and Teban
                  Gardens. It follows 30 route between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and
                  World Trade Centre, and then somehow run between World Trade Centre
                  and Shenton Way Bus Terminal. It runs express between West Coast
                  Highway and World Trade Centre. It can start with full single
                  decker buses first, then along the way if the loading is
                  encouraging then have some double decker buses in the fleet.</p>

              <p>Your ideas are so terrible, it gave me bus cancer.</p>
              <p>What 502 currently needs is more SD -&gt; DD conversion, not a split in route. 502's sole purpose is to get people from the West to Orchard, however there's also demand to IMM. Sometimes people in Toh Guan, based on my observation can't board the SD buses due to the staggering amount of people to the door and have to wait for another bus, again in 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>A split in 502 would cause a huge resource upgrade for whatever these two services end up being, and 502 doesn't have that much demand in weekdays non-peak to justify that. There's also already 502A in the early morning peak hours via Corporation Road/PIE to give leanway to the possible extra time needed for the frequent jams in Clementi &amp; Orchard.</p>
              <p>Your idea of a 198 split, is again terrible. Don't you know there's demand from Jurong West/East Avenue 1 to IKEA/Queensway, and you're cutting the direct link for these people here?</p>
              <p>An express route for Taman Jurong and Teban Gardens will prove inefficient due to the small size of the town. May I suggest for Teban Gardens/Pandan residents to take 201 to Teban Flyover, and change to 97, and Taman Jurong residents to take 154 to Teban Flyover, and change to 97 or take 49 to IBP, cross to the opposite busstop and take 97.</p>
              <p>502 and 198 remains excellent as it is. No need to change.</p>

              <p>Route is way too winding if it has to go through Bedok. There's already 12 to East Coast Rd and 47/48 to Marine Parade Rd there. Unless you route via Eunos --&gt; Marine Parade --&gt; Bedok, then I have no comments.</p>
              <p>In addition, the direct express from Sembawang to Eunos may not benefit enough commuters to warrant such a long stretch. Unless you add stopovers at Yishun and/or Toa Payoh.</p>
              <p>Overall, there could be potential for this service in the future. But not in a way that it could replace 966.</p>

              <p>I was thinking if 858 is amended, 881 (not yet revealed) can replace the lost sectors of 858 along Lentor Ave towards SEM</p>
              <p>880 may be a long route, but it might be reserved for future use when SEM and Canberra are mature estates, but depends on demand to enter those areas 880 serves</p>

              <p>Actually, there is not much demand for residents to go to Changi Village. Sure there would be demand for those who wish to go to Changi Village, but they rather go to eastern areas where there is a lot more going on there.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, you have 9, 19 &amp; 89 coming from outside the terminal. I dont see why they would be crowded except for those who want to go to Changi Cargo Ctr. From what I seen, not even those 4 services are crowded when they enter the terminal. Its not like every part of the day when they are crowded. They would normally be empty after they serve important areas such as Pasir Ris &amp; Simei</p>
              <p>If the residents have high demand for a service to Changi Village, I have 1. But as I say they rather go to the eastern areas instead.</p>

              <p>The best way to check whether there is high demand for North residents to go to Changi Village is to conduct surveys at the terminal and outside. If more than 50% agree that they want a route from SEM to Changi Village, I will take your idea</p>
              <p> Btw, 881 does not serve Lentor Ave on second thought</p>

              <p>Route length should be a second consideration for bus services if:</p>

              <p>#2 - The service has two terminating points to effectively regulate frequency levels and cater to the deployment of additional buses if necessary.</p>
              <p>989 was the longest bus service in Singapore (even longer than 51/61) when in operation and remained a popular choice of travel for the residents of Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok to the eastern parts of Singapore until its withdrawal. Thus, route length should be a lower consideration when designing modern day bus services after the consideration of the <strong>overall reduced travel time and popularity/demand</strong> of<strong> </strong>the proposed services. Granted, if a permanent bus terminal was built in Changi Airport that allowed termination of bus services, 989 would probably be more efficient, and so are the current long distance airport-bound services such as 24, 53 and 858.</p>
              <p>It is nevertheless agreed that 14/51/61 could definitely be split given that no one will take them end-to-end to get to their destinations.</p>
              <p>And it is sad if LTA don't think that expressway services, even if of slightly longer distance, could really work out and possibly help in alleviating the high demand of the rail network.</p>

              <p>Agreed, and once again it would be helpful to have an express service linking Toa Payoh and Tampines / Airport, for the PIE bus stop (Trellis Twrs) to be an effective interchange stop.</p>
              <p>As for splitting ... do any of 10, 196, 197, 961 warrant cutting as well? And what about 30, it is about as long as 51 and 61, but has a short express sector, so would that qualify it as an express by the two criteria you mentioned? </p>

              <p><strong>Sv3: </strong>Tampines &gt; Pasir Ris &gt; Punggol<br><strong>Sv27: </strong>Hougang &gt; Sengkang &gt; Tampines &gt; Changi Airport<br><strong>Sv34: </strong>Punggol &gt; Tampines &gt; Changi Airport<br><strong>Sv39: </strong>Tampines &gt; Pasir Ris &gt; Yishun<br><strong>Sv53: </strong>Bishan &gt; Hougang &gt; Pasir Ris &gt; Changi Airport<br><strong>Sv85: </strong>Punggol &gt; Sengkang &gt; Yishun<br><strong>Sv89: </strong>Hougang &gt; Sengkang &gt; Pasir Ris &gt; Changi Airfreight Ctr<br><strong>Sv89e: </strong>Hougang &gt; Sengkang &gt; Changi Airfreight Ctr<br><strong>Sv117: </strong>Punggol &gt; Yishun &gt; Sembawang<br><strong>Sv118: </strong>Punggol &gt; Tampines &gt; Changi Business Park<br><strong>Sv161: </strong>Hougang &gt; Sengkang &gt; Woodlands<br><strong>Sv168: </strong>Bedok &gt; Tampines &gt; Woodlands<br><strong>Sv858: </strong>Woodlands &gt; Sembawang &gt; Yishun &gt; Changi Airport<br><strong>Sv965: </strong>Woodlands &gt; Yishun &gt; Sengkang<br><strong>Sv969: </strong>Woodlands &gt; Yishun &gt; Tampines</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is also true that many of these services have faster alternatives that overlap one another as well:</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>Tampines to Punggol: </strong>34 or 118 instead of 3<br><strong>Tampines to Yishun: </strong>969 instead of 39<br><strong>Hougang to Changi Airfreight Ctr via Sengkang: </strong>89e instead of 89<br><strong>Sengkang to Woodlands: </strong>161 instead of 965<br><strong>Tampines to Woodlands: </strong>168 instead of 969</span></p>
              <p>Sv117/118 were both rolled out under BSEP and passed by Yishun first before going to Sembawang and Tampines first before going to Changi Business Park respectively. If the LTA really dislike such extensive detouring, why is 117 routed to pass through Yishun and why is 118 routed to pass through Tampines? While 117 is partially limited by the road structure in Seletar Aerospace Park, 118 could have just used TPE, PIE and Upp Changi Rd East instead for maximum speed and reduced travel time.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, some of the semi-express services listed above, agreeably, do require some level of reorganization and rearrangement to improve their efficiencies and reduce the amount of detouring.</p>
              <p>For sv190, one good solution will be to have an Express 190E that plies the same route as sv190, but skips Bukit Panjang totally (using <em>Woodlands Rd</em> &gt; KJE &gt; BKE or <em>Upp Bt Timah Rd</em> &gt; <em>Dairy Farm Rd</em> &gt; BKE). Bukit Panjang is currently also served by sv700/A and sv972, so an additional service between Bukit Panjang and CBD is not necessary.</p>
