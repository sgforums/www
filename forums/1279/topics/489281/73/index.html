              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, don't be so assuming. Your 386 is only half right. Most importantly, if there is a 384G/W, it will not be converted from 84. The route towards northshore is different from Punggol road end. 84 is a trunk service and 38x series are feeder. They will be 2 different standalone services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>NO WAY. 386 is just what I predicted that it would go to Edgedale Plains end and you said NOT possible. </p>
              <p>384G/W can go to Punggol Northshore and Punggol Road end. Hence G/W. This will connect Northshore to Punggol End as well. Once this happens there is no need for 84. 84 is a trunk today. What I am talking of is in the future. Is it so difficult to understand?? </p>

              <p>Firstly, I have to agree that 117 should not be amended like that. If you had seen the 117 pattern, people drop at Jln Kayu/SAP where there are lots of services and facilities. That is why many people take 117 as it provides connection to those areas, in addition to serve the workers from Jln Kayu to relieve 103. </p>
              <p>Sure it is a bit confusing. Though I dont know if people really want to go to those areas.

              <p>And please, that someone who create a new username is so naive. So childish. As for you, you are equally childish too to actually be so jovious to point out that I deserve it? I only voice my opinions. If people who disagree with me are really so childish to do that, let them be. I always view you as a gentleman who have good posts and good views. But now after you say this, I look down on you. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              reading literature is good. I know Punggol very ulu la, but you can always take MRT to serangoon nex library read book, or take bus to Paris Ris White sands library. :)
