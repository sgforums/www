              <p>Svc 190 TIB 553D (Opp Ngee Ann City to Stevens Road).</p>
              <p>I boarded  this bus at 2200 on 9/6/10 and got the worst SMRT bus ride of my life. The bus driver was driving like a mad man and he almost beat the red light at the Wheelock Place junction (Luckily light turned green or else he would not have stop in time). Furthermore, he drove at a fast speed  while negotiating the bend at Stevens Road  despite the fact  that the bus was fully packed and I was standing at the stairs . When I was alighting, my feet gt trapped by the door  but the bus driver did nothing. Fucking dulan!!! Summore got  Australian tourist on board who told me that the bus driver was crazy and said that such things never happen in Australia. This incident is really a fucking digrace to SMRT and to the Spore public transport system.</p>
              <p>I really hope this AssM Mati can consider deploying more buses to serve the Svc 190 route as many ppl are going home to Bt Panjang or Choa Chu Kang from the city  during this time and the buses are usually packed to the brim many times I wanted to board thebus during this time.. Maybe they can introduce Svc 190A which commences its journey from Dhoby Ghaut MRT.</p>

              <p>Theres once I took the bus(my name, SBS8892R) on svc 242. The bus stop dint stop at the place where i ringed the bell. I mean, I ring the bell before the bus stop, but he didnt stop. So many people alighting there but never stop. Damn it must walk back. I heard other ppl complaining while we walk..then ended up late for sch. If I stop at that correct bus stop, I wouldnt be late for sch, as the bus stop is infront of my school!!!</p>

              <p>Svc 190 TIB 553D (Opp Ngee Ann City to Stevens Road).</p>
              <p>I boarded  this bus at 2200 on 9/6/10 and got the worst SMRT bus ride of my life. The bus driver was driving like a mad man and he almost beat the red light at the Wheelock Place junction (Luckily light turned green or else he would not have stop in time). Furthermore, he drove at a fast speed  while negotiating the bend at Stevens Road  despite the fact  that the bus was fully packed and I was standing at the stairs . When I was alighting, my feet gt trapped by the door  but the bus driver did nothing. Fucking dulan!!! Summore got  Australian tourist on board who told me that the bus driver was crazy and said that such things never happen in Australia. This incident is really a fucking digrace to SMRT and to the Spore public transport system.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I really hope this AssM Mati can consider deploying more buses to serve the Svc 190 route as many ppl are going home to Bt Panjang or Choa Chu Kang from the city  during this time and the buses are usually packed to the brim many times I wanted to board thebus during this time..</span> Maybe they can introduce Svc 190A which commences its journey from Dhoby Ghaut MRT.</p>

              <p><br>To be honest, Svc 190 is one of my favourite bus route and I like the frequency of Svc 190 during non peak hours but what is the point of the bus arriving every 5 mins when every bus is filled to the brim (driver won't even open door)and you can't board it during peak hours . In addition, the bus driver was driving recklessly which endanger the lives of the passengers. Don't ge me wrong ... I like buses to be fast only when there are few passengers and it is travelling on the Exp. way  but please drive slower and safely if the bus is fully packed .</p>
              <p>Btw, I am also a bus fan and I like this forum.</p>
