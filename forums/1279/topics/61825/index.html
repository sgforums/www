During this 3rd phase of rationalization, I guess it's both, re-routing and withdrawing, with more re-routing in the process.<br><br>Actually I've boarded service 85 the day before it was withdrawn. Almost all the buses are packed to the brim for journeys from Sengkang / Serangoon to Orchard. It seems that even though after NEL has commenced operations then, many of the commuters (especially students) would rather take buses than train, as many have monthly concession e-stamps. SBST had to divert these commuters to NEL, to break even the costs they had put into the test and implementation of the system. Of course, they had provided alternatives, for example services 65 and 147 along Jalan Besar. But to me, with services 97, 106 and 111 cut back to Marina Centre and with service 81 to Serangoon, this is simply too much to bear. Also, express services like 501, 502, 511 and 512 are in direct compeition to NEL. So now Sengkang to Suntec? NEL to Dhoby Ghaut and transfer 1 stop to City Hall and walk via City Link. No comments about to Jurong East/West. All I can say is that SK - Chinatown - JE/JW would be much faster than buses, although more expensive. I like EW line as the whole trip from City to East or West takes only 30 mins.<br><br>The results of maximising resources may not be visible now, as running both buses and trains in Singapore together on the same stretch may eventually lead to higher fares as SBST may have to put in money for both buses and trains of NE Corridor. SBST also have to take care of the interests of the passengers by not making fares too high and therefore cuts are inevitable. Of course, as a bus lover, I hope services like 81 and 85 stays.<br><br>Rationalization exercises are not new, it happened with the NS and EW lines of SMRT opened. However, I must agree this NEL exercise might be a little to extreme.<br><br>Even SBST had withdrawn services and re-route some, the daily ridership for NEL is still far below expectations, 170,000 compared to the expected 250,000. With Woodleigh and Buangkok closed, this is a measure to save cost. Many are asking, "Why Buangkok station still closed?!", Well, SBST had their own reasons for doing this.<br><br>With SBST making losses, that is why Transport Minister and SMRT Corp would not put away the possibility of transferring NEL to SMRT Corp to reduce the overheads. This proves that their idea of "competition" had failed on train services.<br><br>In businesses, although many passengers are affected, sometimes bus companies have no choice but to make changes that will prove profitable in the long run. The number 1 rule in businesses is to make profits ( a bit of irony, just mentioned that they have to protect interests of commuters by not having ridiculously high fares, but reality is reality ).<br><br>Now we can only sit and wait, waiting for the exercise to begin.<br><br>As many have predicted, service 103 would be one of the services affected. Let's wait and see if this is correct.<br><br><strong>This post is BY NO MEANS representing the stand and decision of SBS Transit. It is my own personal views. Comments are welcomed.</strong></div>

The fully automated system is one of the reasons for higer fares, apart from the complex construction of the railway tunnel.<br><br>Machines are machines, no matter what. I don't like the way they justify why NEL is a driverless system, to save cost for the long run. I mean saving cost doesn't mean putting passengers lives in jeopardy. Also, like that time there's some glitches in NEL and the trains are driven by the CSO (Customer Service Officers) in the train. So why not just employ drivers for the train?</div>

I just hope there won't be re-enactment of Bt Panjang LRT system accident on the NEL. I always waited for a East Bound Train for 8 mins at JE.. I find it too long... 3 trains from Marina Bay reached JE.. not a single East Bound Train.</div>
