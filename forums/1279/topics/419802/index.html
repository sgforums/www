              <p>Good qsn. None. The expressway was already opened but the SL continued to drive into SLE -.- , as he saw a congestion infront, but the location where TP closed the highway has already been opened, therefore confusing him i supposed. Then he exitted into IJG. Then turn into 912's route. LOL. Best of all, SL didnt inform pax anything about it. Then made a big circle, go back BKE and expressway was opened and went past the site.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cause of accident: Trailer truck carrying concrete blocks toppled over, spilling its load all over the expressway. A repeat accident of the PIE accident about 2-3years ago.</p>

              <p>Seriously the authorities should place a strict law on such trucks. The company that operated this vehicle sure kena tio gaogao liao. Last time was Woodlands Transport, now i cant remember this company, quite famous for construction too. Both trucks involved carried concrete blocks, altho the former's load was bigger and heavier. Both involved trailer trucks, both also happened at 5pm. And both happened near a bridge. -.-</p>
              <p>The accident happened directly after SLE exit into BKE, prompting a possible accident caused by high speed turning resulting in the high CG of the truck to topple it over(the exit into BKE is quite a sharp turn). The load could have shifted when the truck was turning, making the truck unstable and toppled it over. A tyre on the trailer might have popped when the truck was turning, causing a sudden change of load support, again throwing the truck out of balance suddenly.</p>
              <p>I always see these trucks using tubed tyres. Tubed tyres are a hazard. They can explode if the outer tyre is damaged, leading to lost of control of vehicle. They puncture easily and deflate rapidly. Thank god SMRT &amp; SBST uses tubeless for most, if not all of their buses.</p>

              <p>Well law can only go to some extent. I ever seen WC plate vehicles on expressway before. Its up to the mentality and the responsibility of the companies and drivers alike to prevent such accidents. Like motorcycles, safety awareness and defensive riding lessons can only help so much, but is useless when you ride recklessly on the roads.</p>

              <p>Seriously the authorities should place a strict law on such trucks. The company that operated this vehicle sure kena tio gaogao liao. Last time was Woodlands Transport, now i cant remember this company, quite famous for construction too. Both trucks involved carried concrete blocks, altho the former's load was bigger and heavier. Both involved trailer trucks, both also happened at 5pm. And both happened near a bridge. -.-</p>
              <p>The accident happened directly after SLE exit into BKE, prompting a possible accident caused by high speed turning resulting in the high CG of the truck to topple it over(the exit into BKE is quite a sharp turn). The load could have shifted when the truck was turning, making the truck unstable and toppled it over. A tyre on the trailer might have popped when the truck was turning, causing a sudden change of load support, again throwing the truck out of balance suddenly.</p>
              <p>I always see these trucks using tubed tyres. Tubed tyres are a hazard. They can explode if the outer tyre is damaged, leading to lost of control of vehicle. They puncture easily and deflate rapidly. Thank god SMRT &amp; SBST uses tubeless for most, if not all of their buses.</p>

              <p>But some things i realised when i saw the scene.</p>
              <p><br>1) the trailer was striaight headed to the center divider. And the divider isn't much damaged.</p>
              <p>2) if the trailer happen to lost control at the SLE exit to BKE, it would have hit the side of the wall near the chevron markings.</p>
              <p>3) working sites is just around the corner of the SLE exit, which could mean the trailer drove down by itself without handbrake or hanbrake failed when its at the site.</p>
              <p>4) if the lorry is at high speed, it would have crossed over the center divider to the opposite direction of the expressway.</p>

              <p>Also, happened to see a damaged motorcycle being craned up to a lorry. It might have been the motorist can't avoid the sudden trap.</p>
              <p>And alot of cars illegally reversing off the entrance of BKE from W'lands Ave 3.</p>
