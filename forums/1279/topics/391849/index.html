              <p>A joke (not real one):</p>
              <p>One day when I boarded SMB130T on 173 at Commenwealth Ave West Stop. The bus was crowded with people inside and don't bother to move to the rear. I asked one of passengers why all people do not bother to move to the rear. He said: ' The female BC is too hot that they want to glance at her!!!'</p>

              <p>But the bus eventually ended up in XXX Interchange. Confused, the tourist confronted the driver where this bus was actually going. Driver told him again "Can't you see?".</p>
              <p>So he went out and looked at the EDS. By that time the service number was reset, so all he saw was "MERRY CHRISTMAS". Thinking it was an insult, the tourist punched the driver.</p>

              <p>during peak hour, a bus arrived at a bus stop to pick up commuters. It was almost packed to the door so the driver said "all aboard, doors are closing" but a lady said "NO, wait till I get my clothes on"..</p>
              <p>those commuters seated towards the entrance door turned their attention to the lady &amp; looked at her hoping to see something pleasant but to their dismay, what the lady got on the bus with was a bag full of clothes that she got from a closing down sale..</p>
