              <p><br>They rotate every week</p>
              <p>For people interested in the sequence for sv. 900, its TIB878S, TIB999B, TIB1049L, TIB904A. TIB1245L may have a tendency to replace TIB904A in the morning, but disspears in the afternoon to give way to TIB904A. Also, TIB1049L and TIB999B will swap their slots in the afternoon, but goes back to their original sequence in the evening. Its pretty odd I must say.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>And to add on, there are two types of design to the generic seats. The first type is the old school looking - 1 long handle on the seats. Can be found on old buses (LO3X, VO3X, 0405 DM/WA OAC.). The second type is the more modern looking 3 handle type, found on newer buses (VO3X 3rd batch, B10M MK IV Strider/DM/DM3500, O4O5 CACs).</p>
              <p>Apart from the appearances, i believe they all the same kind of seats.</p>

              <p>You do raise a valid point there. Sure, they don't take public transport. All they do is perceive. However, do note that cost of operation is not limited to fuel cost. Employee's payroll also comes into play. With inflation, everything goes up. Cost of spare parts and many other things go up.</p>
              <p>Also, another possible reason for this increase is that the fuel the SBS and SMRT use are hedged. They do not immediately feel the drop in price. This though does reflect a poor hedging policy both companies have if true.</p>
              <p>Lastly, its probably because fuel prices are too volatile. If they remove it, it'll be hard to implement again. I too would like to see the 30cents fuel surcharge removed. It's stupid. Cost of fuel should be factored into the fare increase. In my opinion, fuel surcharge has been abused by many companies. I hope to see it go, but won't hold my breath over it.</p>

              <p>Do they raised the fares when the oil price hits US$147/barrel ? No they didnt do it. Yes.. The prices of oil has come down. But have u thought about it another way ? They did absorb the fares when it hit US$147. They had to charged consumers the same as before.</p>
              <p>And please, this is the bus forums where people come together to share the smae passion. You are always welcome here. But if you want to treat this place where u vent your anger just because of the 4c raise in fares. Do it elsewhere. u are not welcome here.</p>
