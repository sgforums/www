              <p>Can anyone state the changes in deployment &amp; lay-up for the Scania N113CRB since August? I see until luan liao, very confusing... please include all deployment changes, from perm service to SP, then lay-up and de-register and so-on...</p>
              <p>If nobody can then thats all right... just realised that there seemed to be many unknown holes when I tried putting all the deployments together... then got more and more mixed up. x.X</p>
