              <p>You guys can carry on whining about which depot should get whatever buses. You know something? I dont want buses from these 2 incompetent companies anymore.Fine, let BNdepot have all the old buses if that makes you happy.  If given a choice, I would like KMB from HK to be our 3rd bus company and take over the eastern part of Singapore. I would gladly be on a MAN bus waving at you guys especially those on the crappy pathetic K230UBs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would not settle for the 2nd best if I would you guys.</p>
              <p>1980s and 1990s are still the best days of bus spotting. We have so many different bus types are the service is way way better than now. What I have just said is just an understatement.</p>
              <p>Our transport in 2008 is way way backwards. If you ask me there should already be an intergrated season pass,  more concession passes for both visitors and working adults and fleet of both buses should at least be 80% low floor if not wheelchair buses.</p>
              <p>When my UK friends came to Singapore and took the K230UB for their first time, do you know what was their comment?</p>
              <p>-Pathetic bus, are you sure this is your new bus? Why are the steps so high up? Why is the braking and suspension so terrible? Is it due to their maintainence? Mind you it was 8497 on her first day of svc. ( A good condition KUB bus on 36)</p>
              <p>I can go on and on. These are just a few issues that I hope would be ironed out in the future.</p>

              <p><br>Which part? near Shunfu or near Bishan St 22? The first buses northbound are at least 0630hrs. If u want to reach Hougang by 0615hrs, u need to cab there.</p>
              <p>First bus S88 from Bishan MRT towards Pasir Ris is 0535hrs, first bus S74 from AMK MRT towards Hougang is 0600hrs.</p>
              <p>What you can do is to walk to Bishan St 22 take 88 to Hougang Ave 8 Montford Sec, transfer to 74 or 101.</p>

              So based on the bottom left as rego no; these tickets were believed to be from Albon Viking EVK41L with Soon Chow bodywork buses. The pictures of these buses that can be found on pg14 of Mike Davis "Singapore Buses - Part One" shows that these buses got only one door at the middle. 
              
              But I remembered when i was very young that this type of ticket started around yr 1983 - the yr when old AMK bus interchange opened; that period of time was already the MB OF1417 buses era? 
              
              any seniors can shed more light on this mystery?

              <p>I am new here, and will like to join into this discussion about our bus services. I had the privilege of enjoying the rides of various bus models in my younger days.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the renewal of the buses, the bus companies should really invest in the maintaining the appearance of the buses. And not forgetting the interior and air conditioning too. Not forgetting each bus costing a few hundred k. During my part time days with SBS, each driver is assigned his own bus, with a partner. And they don't change bus unless their "baby" is in the workshop or transferred. They are ultimately responsible to the well being of their bus.</p>
              <p>Bus rides are fun especially with the variety. But not much more. I am still hopeful that SBS will include more bus models, not just keeping to the Scania.</p>
              <p>I have also read with interests about some of the questions pertaining to the mechanicals of the buses. I will love to exchange some info.</p>

              more. I am still hopeful that SBS will include more bus
              models, not just keeping to the Scania.</p>
              <p>I have also read with interests about some of the questions
              pertaining to the mechanicals of the buses. I will love to exchange
              some info.</p>

              <p>I am new here, and will like to join into this discussion about our bus services. I had the privilege of enjoying the rides of various bus models in my younger days.</p>
              <p>While I appreciate the renewal of the buses, the bus companies should really invest in the maintaining the appearance of the buses. And not forgetting the interior and air conditioning too. Not forgetting each bus costing a few hundred k. During my part time days with SBS, each driver is assigned his own bus, with a partner. And they don't change bus unless their "baby" is in the workshop or transferred. They are ultimately responsible to the well being of their bus.</p>
              <p>Bus rides are fun especially with the variety. But not much more. I am still hopeful that SBS will include more bus models, not just keeping to the Scania.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm, say, to maintain the appearance of the buses in tip top condition (paintwork, bodywork, interior) is a tad too demanding lol.</p>
              <p>From what i observe:</p>
              <p>To begin with, the buses will be used till it's lifespan expiry at 17 years from the date of purchase (excluding lifespan extensions). During these years, the buses will go through various environments and elements, such as dust, dirt, mud, rain, sun. Exterior wise, all the environments and elements would have worn down the shiny new paintwork in a matter of days</p>
              <p>Interior wise, the components will wear down, be vandalised, etc. Also, the elements will have worn in after aging, and if there's a long lifespan remaining for the bus, they'll replace the worn components</p>
              <p>BCs take a look at their bus everyday to check the conditions of their buses before their start of the day in the morning, sweep the floors, clean the rubbish from the window ledge. Over the course of the day, inconsiderate passengers would have littered the bus in places the BC may not notice.</p>
              <p>The bus company takes reasonable effort to wash the bus fleets to clean them till the day where they will bring the bus for repainting/refurbishing during their mid-life. For example, SMRT recently refurbished their O405's interior.</p>
              <p>For now, i feel that the variety of buses is still there. But if the replacement buses for other outgoing buses are Gemilang bodyworked buses, then maybe there'll be a reason to be bored. </p>

              <p>Agree it is demanding. But image is important.</p>
              <p>The bus companies should assign the buses to the same pair of BC, as in the past. This may improve its maintenance level. I used to see BC taking pride in their buses and decorating their buses during festive seasons, but not anymore.</p>
              <p>We have only got MB, Volvo, Scania, Leyland and a few Dennis, and not forgetting the lone MAN to talk about. </p>

              <p>My personal favourite is Volvo B10M MKII. The current MKIV is good too.</p>
              <p>Followed by MB O305.  </p>
              <p>I like the Volvo mid-engine design. Gives good balance when negotiating a bend, much better than rear engine models. And it does not have the rocking horse effect when taking on a road hump.</p>

              <p>So based on the bottom left as rego no; these tickets were believed to be from Albon Viking EVK41L with Soon Chow bodywork buses. The pictures of these buses that can be found on pg14 of Mike Davis "Singapore Buses - Part One" shows that these buses got only one door at the middle. But I remembered when i was very young that this type of ticket started around yr 1983 - the yr when old AMK bus interchange opened; that period of time was already the MB OF1417 buses era? any seniors can shed more light on this mystery?</p>

              <p>I am still fotunate to be able to board the Leyland Oylimpians 2 Axle as well as LA, as well as Mk 2 and so old buses, i pity those new young bus fans comming into the era of this SBST and SMRTB days 10 years later, what they are spotting are KUBS and OCS, it is really a bad time.</p>
              <p>Speaking to KUBS...here are some comments i had collected</p>
              <p>"Those buses sucks, high steps, no seats"</p>
              <p>"Old people falls and no place to handle PIW as other people take the seats"</p>
              <p>By some people close to me</p>
              <p>It is seriously a time to rethink about our transport policies and our modal of transport. My suggestion of buses are</p>
              <p>1. Allow non WAB buses to be brought and deployed on routes that are not WAB friendy</p>
              <p>2. Thrid bus company needed...not local....foreign company needed and no limitations to their buses</p>
              <p>3. In addition, improving frequency is a must, and those buses need to be faster, as in the speed limit is to be raised to 65-68kph....</p>

              <p>Mandatory purchase of WABs -&gt; To allow the gradual transition of SG's public transport to be accessible to all by (i think) 2020. Now there are still high floor buses -&gt; the Hispano Habits were most likely the last batch of buses that are having two steps at the entrance and exit.</p>
              <p>Buses must be 15m or less -&gt; Lessons learnt from the bendies. Too long, not good. But 15m bus still quite long though.</p>
              <p><br>i'm curious though, what are the implications you are thinking that it have?</p>
