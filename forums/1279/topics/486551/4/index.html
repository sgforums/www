              <p>Hi mr car bike bus, I don't agree. With or without the condo, prices for flats near intergrated bus interchange will be definitely more expensive than similar houses far away. Nothing very surprising. Just put an mrt or bus interchange at doorstep is enough to drive up the house price by 50k. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr car bike bus, I agree with you on this. However I really do not like idea of bus interchange extension. I prefer lta embark on new interchanges and not on current interchange extension. What about you? Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi mr car bike bus, 18.6km per direction. Next year, when Punggol waterway point mall is up at yr 2015 end, it will be even much more crowded given that it is the 2nd largest in northeast after NEX. Hope LTA introduce at least 2 bus services before October 2015 in anticipation of the pent-up feeling of a lack of super mega size mall in Punggol. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Loading between Sengkang west and east town on sv 50 is high...  but see most buses between Sengkang east and Punggol kind of empty except for AM towards Bishan. AM towards Punggol, and PM both directions have observed quite low loads on sv 50 in this area. Maybe after this mall comes up, loading will go up.</p>

              <p>Hi mr bus analyzer, the loading is super high. On normal days, I count around 50+ people boarding Sbs 50 at stop outside sengkang mrt towards anchor vale and fernvale. Now even opposite direction from seletar mall towards sengkang mrt also experienced lots of crowd. I think this is the fastest way for people from fernvale/anchorvale to get to sengkang mrt. Sbs 163 is just too irregular and a bit long winded route. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, yes good move by LTA. Cck, yishun, sengkang and Punggol. These are the 4 towns which deserve it. So many new flats are built at yishun, sengkang and Punggol. So naturally where there are flats, there must be new services. Sengkang and Punggol interchange still have space for more bus services. Yishun int is a temporary interchange. So definitely can cater for it now. As for CCK, the last time I visited CCK, I saw still has space for another service. Hope LTA introduces trunk services this time round. Maybe of around 15km per direction. Cheers. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For CCK and Sengkang, I'm guessing new feeder services will be introduced, serving CCK Ave 6,Brickland Road or CCK Street 54/CCK Drive for the new CCK service while Fernvale St/Link via Anchorvale Street for the new Sengkang service. For Yishun, can have a new trunk service plying between Yishun and Punggol via Yishun Ave 1, Seletar North Link and Punggol Way while for Punggol can introduce a direct express service to the CBD, just my 2 cents worth.</p></div>

              <p>Yeah but Yishun already have so many feeders/Intratowns, perhaps can introduce an inter-town route like 861?</p>

              sooner or later this will be required given condos/BTOs coming up

              <p>Also should introduce one more trunk service that goes via

              <p>Ok good.</p>
              <p>Sengkang - This will be service for Sengkang West along Sengkang West Way for sure. Expect feeder. Or short trunk looping @ Seletar Hills</p>
              <p>Punggol - This will be feeder connecting Waterway district (east). What a waste if it is. 386 should be extended to do full Waterway complex to make it more effective. Punggol should get trunk via Waterway just like you have sv 50 covering Punggol Dr.</p>
              <p>Yishun -  I hope not another feeder but I am sure it will be. This time I think will be Khatib feeder though connecting Yishun ave 1, st 41, 51 to Khatib MRT... but will have to operate from Yishun as starting point. </p>
              <p>CCK - Has to be 301 feeder to Keat Hong... hope it is short trunk that terminates at BPJ so that Keat Hong residents get access to both DTL and NSL.</p>
