              <p>Hi mr Guides anyone, no surprises here. Since Punggol is a trial town, it is being viewed as one for experiments. Thus the interchange is also a temporary one. So no surprises that after 12 years and more, it is still a temporary bus interchange. In this town, HDB flats are still being built by the masses and many other essential facilities and amenities are still being built and planned. Everything is still very slow! Cheers. </p>

              <p>And if you see designated slots per service is not even 2... this means buses have to quque up hoping next bus will move out soon before they can park. </p>
              <p>That's why I am advocating that depots can be used more and more to start/terminate buses, especially for trunk services.</p>
              <p>45, 48 and 185 are doing quite okay terminating at depots. </p>

              <p>In my opinion, I feel that there should be a second bus interchange at Bukit Batok or/and Choa Chu Kang. </p>
              <p>With a large amount of new residential developments coming up at Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang, more bus routes will be created to serve the new areas. <span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">The bus interchanges at Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang may not be able to cater to the projected increase in demand as a result of the new residential developments.</span></p>
              <p>Obviously, the increase in demand can be met with having bus route to Bukit Gombak. However, these bus routes have to originate from somewhere, and the bus interchanges at Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang are already almost fully occupied.</p>
              <p>Having roadside terminals may not be feasible, considering quite a number of new routes are required.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">There should be a new bus interchange somewhere around Bukit Batok Road. I would suggest a bus interchange similar to Bukit Merah Bus Interchange; not next to any MRT station. We can have bus routes originating from here and looping around MRT stations, or connecting to MRT stations.</span></p>
              <p>There is land at Bukit Gombak MRT station to construct a bus interchange similar to BB int and CCK int. However, the road network around it may not be able to support.</p>
              <p>The junction of Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road is a good site to consider. It is next to major roads and there are major ammenities nearby. While it serves as an "external" interchange for bus routes, it can serve as a large bus stop for many people to alight to walk to their respetive destinations.</p>
              <p>Nearby ammenities:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>ITE college west</li>
              <li>Bukit Batok Driving Centre</li>
              <li>HometeamNS @ Bukit Batok</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">future health care development across the road</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>However, the cons is that it is next to landed properties. Nonetheless, that can be solved by installing noise bearers, building concrete walls to block views, etcetera.</p>
              <p> CCK int site is 16792.41 sq m and BB int site is 16651.81 sq m.  <span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">The land parcel at Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road is 44669.2 square metres.</span><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;"> We can have a bus interchange there that is even larger than CCK int and BB int combined - yet need not worry about the traffic because it is next to major roads (Brickland Road, Bukit Batok Road and Bukit Batok West Avenue 5).</span></p>

                  interchange at Bukit Batok or/and Choa Chu Kang. </p>
              <p>With a large amount of new residential developments coming up at
                  Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang, more bus routes will be created to
                  serve the new areas. <span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">The bus interchanges at Bukit
                  Batok and Choa Chu Kang may not be able to cater to the projected
                  increase in demand as a result of the new residential
                  developments.</span></p>
              <p>Obviously, the increase in demand can be met with having bus
                  route to Bukit Gombak. However, these bus routes have to originate
                  from somewhere, and the bus interchanges at Bukit Batok and Choa
                  Chu Kang are already almost fully occupied.</p>
              <p>Having roadside terminals may not be feasible, considering quite
                  a number of new routes are required.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">There should be a
                  new bus interchange somewhere around Bukit Batok Road. I would
                  suggest a bus interchange similar to Bukit Merah Bus Interchange;
                  not next to any MRT station. We can have bus routes originating
                  from here and looping around MRT stations, or connecting to MRT
                  stations.</span></p>
              <p>There is land at Bukit Gombak MRT station to construct a bus
                  interchange similar to BB int and CCK int. However, the road
                  network around it may not be able to support.</p>
              <p>The junction of Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road
                  is a good site to consider. It is next to major roads and there are
                  major ammenities nearby. While it serves as an "external"
                  interchange for bus routes, it can serve as a large bus stop for
                  many people to alight to walk to their respetive destinations.</p>
              <p>Nearby ammenities:</p>

              </ol>
              <p>However, the cons is that it is next to landed properties.
                  Nonetheless, that can be solved by installing noise bearers,
                  building concrete walls to block views, etcetera.</p>
              <p> CCK int site is 16792.41 sq m and BB int site is 16651.81
                  sq m.  <span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">The land
                  parcel at Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 and Bukit Batok Road is 44669.2
                  square metres.</span><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;"> We can have a bus
                  interchange there that is even larger than CCK int and BB int
                  combined - yet need not worry about the traffic because it is next
                  to major roads (Brickland Road, Bukit Batok Road and Bukit Batok
                  West Avenue 5).</span></p>

              <p>Alterntaively, the solution is to really construct a bus interchange next to Bukit Gombak MRT station. However, considering that it is not along main roads, I think it can only be a small/medium-sized bus interchange.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">There was a suggestion made previously to have a station between cck and bg. I think the</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> site at Brickland Road/Bukit Batok Road/Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 is also a good location to have an additional North South Line station. It is approximately 1.95km away from CCK station and 1.05km away from BG station. If it is approved and a bus interchange is built next to it, it can yield large amounts of traffic, while relieve the traffic from Choa Chu Kang MRT and Bukit Batok MRT.</span></p>

              <p>Yes, this is precisely why I mentioned that there needs to be an interchange at Keat Hong. There is still land around CCK Ave 7, CCK Grove, where interchange can be built.</p>
              <p>I do like the proposal of having interchange at Bukit Gombak instead. At the end of the day, usability increases when bus interchange is connected to MRT. Given the huge mammoth development coming along Bukit Batok West &amp; Keat Hong areas, I am surprised LTA is not planning for this area with an extension bus interchange. </p>
              <p>I feel more ideal would be to have overlay interchange at Bukit Batok and CCK just like you have at Tampines and Sengkang. </p>
              <p>At Bukit Batok, there is a huge land parcel empty right next to MRT and BBT Central (east side of MRT). A huge interchange can replace existing interchange here. </p>
              <p>At CCK also, a huge interchange can be built demolishing existing interchange at east side of CCK MRT, next to CCK Center and along CCK Dr. </p>
              <p>So there is enough space along both MRTs to build a newer bigger interchange; if they want to do it, they can do it.</p>
