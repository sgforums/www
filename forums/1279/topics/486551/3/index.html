              <p>Anyway... there is no news of Buangkok interchange yet... even
              if they announce now... will not come up until 2019/2020... so
              there is still 4-5 years for the temporary extension... and i agree
              that this extension will stay.</p>
              <p>Not sure about tampines extension though.. in a weird place..
              and with CBP and tampines north interchange.. may or may not need

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I am surprised by the location of tampines extended interchange though. Quite far off. Unless this extended tampines interchange is 1 of the entrance/exit of the future downtown line for tampines. Anybody can confirm this? Cheers. </p>

              <p>It is also not very close to DTL.. I am sure they will make a link to DTL but that will be only in 2017 of use. Yes, location is bad. But I guess it is a tradeoff between more services and not having. </p>

              <p>I think what is possible here is that there is a service
              selected from each of the groups you classified together that goes
              out to the extension.</p>
              <p>Notice that you classified the services into groups like
              Industrial and Feeder and say at one shot all those in each group
              cannot go out.</p>
              <p>My point is, if they really want to minimise the damage, they'll
              probably take one feeder, one Industrial-bound, one city-bound and
              one intratown out to the extension. </p>
              <p>37, 18, 292 and one city-bound. (Dk which city-bound because Sv
              10 &amp; 65 is always packed). I wouldn't say all the services are
              not packed. Just that they aren't that packed for like 3/4 of the
              day, when compared to the rest in their groups. (eg. don't compare
              the Sv 37 load versus Sv 81, compare Sv 37's all-day loading to 19
              or 29, or Sv 292 vs 291 &amp; 293. </p>

              <p>Was just thinking.. sv 3 could be a good candidate to operate from extension... have a stop right outside MRT (stop of 21/27/168) for those who don't want to walk to extended interchange.</p>

I have also seen 38 leaving with about 30-40 pax. 39's pax amount depends whether 20, 39 or 292 comes first. Not many actually takes 8 from Tamp Int (At least I don't see many) and hardly any Temasek pax takes 8 from Int.</p>

              <p>Yes, please refer the map on LTA website or the link I posted here earlier, which shows the interchange almost at the end of Tampines Concourse. Int extension is closer to Tampines Ave 9, than Tampines Interchange.</p>
              <p>You have valid point on sv 81 for sure. Let's see how they plan it out. I also believe they will introduce parallel service to 27 once the extension is complete. </p>

              <p>Not sure if it would have made better sense to have an
              interchange with 12 parking bays at Tampines East (with DTL line).
              That way crowding of the Tampines Central area could also have been

              <p>Thanks for the links, the location is quite bad for any service to be amended there. They need to loop at the existing one first. About Tamp East, there is no space there to build one as far as I can tell. If really need a service from there, can start from Loyang Depot.</p>
              <p>Off-topic, but when looking at the maps, I read the comments section and one wall of text caught my attention. What happen on Sept 3 regarding 179/182?</p>

              <p>If you look carefully at the proposed map, Tampines Interchange extension is so far away from the current interchange...by 4th quarter 2015, the extension site will be complete and a linkway will join both areas but it is not considered a 'proper interchange'...I suppose he means that amenities which makes it a proper interchange will take up a total of 4 years to build when even the building of the DTL station makes it a burden...</p>
