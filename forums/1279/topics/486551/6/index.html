              <p>I agree you cannot separate bus interchange on two levels - one for feeder, other for trunks. A lot of trunk services behave like feeder within town before heading out. </p>
              <p>If we take Tampines as example: 293 on one level and 28 on another would not be a good idea. Bcoz many take 28 as a feeder within Tampines East town.</p>

              <p>Another problem will be the buses entering the different levels as well, as different entrances and exits have to be built for them, and it might take a longer time to clear the traffic.</p>

              <p>Not possible. In every town, people use trunk services as feeder to get home, even if there is a dedicated feeder.</p>
              <p>For instance, if someone wants to travel to Bedok Reservoir Rd (west of North Ave 3) from Bedok MRT, they have an option of taking sv 66 (trunk) or sv 228 (feeder). They will take whichever comes first. if you isolate one from the other, you will have to add more buses to sv 228 to manage the load. This is not practical. </p>
              <p>Same goes for many other services like 28, 29, 293 etc. </p>

              <p>I encourage trunk services to ply inner roads and not just bigger avenues. I love sv 28 route. It provides direct connectivity to ave 9, st 45, 32, 31 residents to Bedok and beyond, who otherwise would have to take feeder and then change. </p>
              <p>But not having feeders is not a solution given that trunk services can get delayed on their way and people wanting to get to MRT might get stranded with longer waiting time. Given this, SWT will have to be started and that would be similar to feeder. </p>

              <p>I still don't understand why they don't use depots. HGDEP is in a good location to have trunks start from there. Just like SLBP, BNDEP, AMDEP have a few, I don't see a reason why BBDEP and HGDEP should not have services starting from there.</p>
              <p>For HGDEP, service like 115 can already initiate from HGDEP and loop @ Kovan MRT. Some services like 116 can be extended via Defu Ave to terminate at HGDEP. This will also free up space at interchanges. Ever see BCs waiting at HG interchange for a bus to leave so that it can park bus and go for rest. Waste good 3-4 mins in this.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, 84 got chance start from sengkang. 83 not possible. 83 is a very important service for Punggol central and Punggol east and Punggol field residents. By reversing the starting interchange for sbs 83 will greatly inconvenience Punggol residents. Sbs 83 functions as an important feeder for these groups of residents. Besides sbs 83, there is only sbs 3 which serves the same purpose. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Okay. My point of view.</p>
              <p>Main feeder use is for Punggol Central connection to MRT as LRT is not there. For Punggol Field, LRT and sv 62 connect to MRT faster than 3/83.</p>
              <p>If it is purely connecting sv 3/83 between Punggol Field/Central... firstly not too many pax... secondly 2 services are good enough.. </p>
              <p>If we see like that no connection between Punggol West and Punggol Central/Field towns or Punggol Dr and Punggol Central.</p>
              <p>I agree to your point that Punggol Central residents need timely buses to come to connect to MRT. Hence, even sv 85 is important to clear loads. 3,83,85 + a new trunk in future would be good enough to take care of the loads here.</p>

              <p>Not possible. In every town, people use trunk services as feeder
              to get home, even if there is a dedicated feeder.</p>
              <p>For instance, if someone wants to travel to Bedok Reservoir Rd
              (west of North Ave 3) from Bedok MRT, they have an option of taking
              sv 66 (trunk) or sv 228 (feeder). They will take whichever comes
              first. if you isolate one from the other, you will have to add more
              buses to sv 228 to manage the load. This is not
              practical. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, </p>
              <p>For Punggol field, LRT is faster to mrt. Sbs 3 and 83 (even one round from field to mrt) is as fast as sbs 62 (due to its poor frequency because of loop service). Many people rather walk to opposite stop take sbs 3 and sbs 83 to mrt. </p>
              <p>Sbs 3 and sbs 83 are the only two services connecting Punggol field and central so mr carbikebus suggestion to make sbs 83 start from sengkang is out. If start from sengkang, sbs 83 may be jammed at Punggol road (before going to Punggol) causing bad frequencies. Furthermore sbs 3 is already subjected to winding roads at pasir ris and highly susceptible to jams at TPE before turning into Punggol. That will be disastrous for Punggol residents if sbs 3 and sbs 83 are being touched currently.</p>
              <p>For punggol west, current way is LRT. For Punggol drive to central, walk or do transfer by sbs 50.</p>
              <p>For those staying at Punggol central, sbs 3 and sbs 83 are crucial. Sbs 85 helps sometimes only purely due to its poor frequency. Yes a new trunk is needed at this moment.</p>
              <p>Most residents are already hoping Punggol gets 2 bus services in Q1 2015. One will be trunk and one will be feeder. Out of 4 new services planned, 1 go to queens town and 1 to CCK and 2 to Punggol. In terms of new HDB flats, this should be fair.
