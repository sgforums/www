              <p>Read this article. It says both Sengkang and Tampines Interchange will get additional 12 parking bays.</p>
              <p>This means the earlier press release was misunderstood to think 12 parking bays are for Tampines North Interchange.</p>
              <p>This will be in addition to Tampines North Interchange.</p>
              <p>At same time, given the high amount of devleopment along Buangkok/Sengkang/Punggol, Sengkang interchange will also get 12 additional bus parking bays.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, no need to change sbs 83 current route and its starting interchange. This is because sbs 83 serves as a very important feeder service for the Punggol residents along Punggol central/east/field. This is more crucial a feeder service for Punggol rather than sengkang. Thus sbs 83 originates from Punggol interchange so that the timing from Punggol can be better controlled and the residents do not have to depend too heavily on traffic conditions along the dreadful Punggol road bus stop after TPE turn-in in sengkang. By starting from sengkang, this objective will definitely be compromised. Better to introduce new services from sengkang interchange to link those sengkang west fernvale/anchorvale area and the Punggol west current unpopulated area. Cheers. </p>

              <p>In my opinion, I feel that LTA should have constructed new bus interchanges somewhere away from the MRT and have some bus routes re-routed to originate from there, and loop around the current bus interchanges.</p>
              <p>The new expressway bus stop was a good move, and I thought LTA was considering this option. </p>
              <p>Personally, I am disappointed that LTA chose to build a "second" bus interchange near to bus interchanges that are already operating at full capacity.</p>
              <p>Firstly, are the roads able to cope with more buses utilising it? Hopefully, the "second" bus interchanges can have the exits and entrances at a road different than the road being used by the bus interchange.</p>
              <p>Secondly, when the land is about to be re-developed for mixed-used developments in future, where will the "second" bus interchanges relocate to? That is why I think both are temporary, and will be replaced when the new bus interchange at Buangkok is built in future.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, speaking of which, I am curious why did LTA not implement the plan to have the temporary bus terminal at Joo Koon in year 2009, and have something like Bukit Merah Bus Interchange. If they had that tempoary bus terminal, some bus services could already be re-routed and Boon Lay Bus Interchange would already have capacity for new bus services.</p>
              <p>Fourth, if LTA can build a "second" bus interchange near to bus interchanges that are already operating at full capacity, why did it not use the temporary bus interchange at Boon Lay (Jurong West) to have new bus services at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, but instead demolish it two years ago in year 2012? It could have been a temporary "second" bus interchange to enable Boon Lay to have new  bus services, until the new bus interchange at Joo Koon is built. Well, at least now the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange will open soon, in around three to six months' time, which means Boon Lay Bus Interchange can have new bus services soon. So, this argument is rather invalid now. :/ Nonetheless, this supports my first point on the possible road congestions that may occur when the "second" bus interchanges are built.</p>
              <p>I hope when this decision to build "second" bus interchanges was made, there are also plans to expand the surrounding roads (my first concern) and delay the development of the land used (my second concern). Otherwise, LTA should consider studying the possible impacts and take the necessary measures to prevent them.</p>

              <p>And, the heavy loadings are during Off-Peak too. The only service that really don't have much pax all day round from Tampines Int is Sv 18. (and this even depends on whether a Sv 8 / 38 bus has left the Int before the Sv 18). Regards.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>In my opinion, I feel that LTA should have constructed new bus
              interchanges somewhere away from the MRT and have some bus routes
              re-routed to originate from there, and loop around the current bus
              interchanges.</p>
              <p>The new expressway bus stop was a good move, and I thought LTA
              was considering this option. </p>
              <p>Personally, I am disappointed that LTA chose to build a "second"
              bus interchange near to bus interchanges that are already operating
              at full capacity.</p>
              <p>Firstly, are the roads able to cope with more buses utilising
              it? Hopefully, the "second" bus interchanges can have the exits and
              entrances at a road different than the road being used by the bus
              interchange.</p>
              <p>Secondly, when the land is about to be re-developed for
              mixed-used developments in future, where will the "second" bus
              interchanges relocate to? That is why I think both are temporary,
              and will be replaced when the new bus interchange at Buangkok is
              built in future.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, speaking of which, I am curious why did LTA not
              implement the plan to have the temporary bus terminal at Joo Koon
              in year 2009, and have something like Bukit Merah Bus Interchange.
              If they had that tempoary bus terminal, some bus services could
              already be re-routed and Boon Lay Bus Interchange would already
              have capacity for new bus services.</p>
              <p>Fourth, if LTA can build a "second" bus interchange near to bus
              interchanges that are already operating at full capacity, why did
              it not use the temporary bus interchange at Boon Lay (Jurong West)
              to have new bus services at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, but instead
              demolish it two years ago in year 2012? It could have been a
              temporary "second" bus interchange to enable Boon Lay to have new
               bus services, until the new bus interchange at Joo Koon is
              built. Well, at least now the new Joo Koon Bus Interchange will
              open soon, in around three to six months' time, which means Boon
              Lay Bus Interchange can have new bus services soon. So, this
              argument is rather invalid now. :/ Nonetheless, this supports my
              first point on the possible road congestions that may occur when
              the "second" bus interchanges are built.</p>
              <p>I hope when this decision to build "second" bus interchanges was
              made, there are also plans to expand the surrounding roads (my
              first concern) and delay the development of the land used (my
              second concern). Otherwise, LTA should consider studying the
              possible impacts and take the necessary measures to prevent
              them.</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, for sengkang extended interchange, it is just across the road. The site is ideal. Traffic is not much. I will disagree with you that they will dismantle this extension even when Buangkok is up next time. The extension is needed as the current interchange is small. It is always better to build bigger than smaller as the number of buses will increase not drop. There must always be additional bus bays for standby aa not very appropriate to build all up to capacity. You can always rest assured homework is done by LTA when site is selected. Cheers. </p>

              <p>I think what is possible here is that there is a service selected from each of the groups you classified together that goes out to the extension.</p>
              <p>Notice that you classified the services into groups like Industrial and Feeder and say at one shot all those in each group cannot go out.</p>
              <p>My point is, if they really want to minimise the damage, they'll probably take one feeder, one Industrial-bound, one city-bound and one intratown out to the extension. </p>
              <p>37, 18, 292 and one city-bound. (Dk which city-bound because Sv 10 &amp; 65 is always packed). I wouldn't say all the services are not packed. Just that they aren't that packed for like 3/4 of the day, when compared to the rest in their groups. (eg. don't compare the Sv 37 load versus Sv 81, compare Sv 37's all-day loading to 19 or 29, or Sv 292 vs 291 &amp; 293. </p>

              <p>I think what is possible here is that there is a service
              selected from each of the groups you classified together that goes
              out to the extension.</p>
              <p>Notice that you classified the services into groups like
              Industrial and Feeder and say at one shot all those in each group
              cannot go out.</p>
              <p>My point is, if they really want to minimise the damage, they'll
              probably take one feeder, one Industrial-bound, one city-bound and
              one intratown out to the extension. </p>
              <p>37, 18, 292 and one city-bound. (Dk which city-bound because Sv
              10 &amp; 65 is always packed)</p>

              <p>But if they want to reduce the # of complaints... they will have to select not-very-high loading or trunk services to go there. For instance, it could be okay for 969 to operate from there. Anyway... most ppl are long distance travellers.. with travelators on the connector between interchange... complaints would be far less than on 37 or 292 moving to new interchange.</p>
