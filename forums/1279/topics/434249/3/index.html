              <p><br> Which was why I seek clarification at the end. BUT....its also a
              known fact that MAN was never known to be cheap to start with.</p>
              <p>Ok, so where's the "remaining" Citaro purported to have been
              purchased as raised by lemon1974? Nobody has yet to answer
              that.</p>
              <p>So why didn't SMRT build on that earlier Citaro order? And then
              if we follow your logic (prefectly logical), then SMRT's purchase
              and earlier trial might have convinced SBST to put bulk order,
              thereby preventing SMRT access to Citaros in quick order....like
              that is lagi LPPL right? Because even if SBST's purchase wasn't
              directly related, it is inextricably linked because the trial and
              purchase would have vindicated the Citaro (hmmm yes, nice bus =&gt;
              let's buy it!)</p>
              <p>Costs aside. Where's my DDs and bendies?</p>
              <p>Why SDs again?</p>
              <p>You are convinced by SMRT's claim at "trying to be productive"?
              I am far from being impressed. SBST certainly doesn't
              advertise 160/170 on its NEL. *snorts*</p>
              <p>But I like the MAN. How ironic.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>No problem.</p>
              <p>Ok, before people start accusing us of flaming. All these have no personal attacks what so ever.</p>
              <p>Now....let's talk.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>"Productivity" here was with reference to the justification for fare hikes. It struck me as very funny when SMRT claims it has been "trying" to improve productivity when in the end one BC ferries so few pax.</p>
              <p>SMRT has little experience with MAN buses. I would be guessing that servicing and indent and even driving the MAN etc etc will be a learning experience for everyone there. Of course I daren't say too much about future servicing costs, but we've had types that gave mainteinance headaches (Dennis products comes to mind)....and even the L113s are falling apart. While the bus's durability might indeed be dependant on the brand, the size of the spare parts market plays a major role rather than the mere <em>presence</em> of the market itself. There are many Scania buses in SG...but the 113s for SBST and SMRT were never known to be terribly reliable.</p>
              <p>SMRT's most reliable bus is the 0405....that is doubtless. My guess is that beyond the good old chassis, having 700 0405s in SBST played a role in this. MB would be commited in servicing this huge number of buses. Just about the other types in SMRT's fleet is falling apart, including the 0405Gs which turbocharges the 0405's engine making it more complex and forces it to work harder. I am not sure if servicing costs for all these types actually went down upon purchase. It also boils down to how SMRT BCs love to whack their buses.</p>
              <p>In short, you can have MAN as good as can be, but its not a given that the mainteinance costs will be reduced just because the order exceeds 100 or any given number. Perhaps to reduce mainteinance costs that way, you might be needing to exceed a large figure like 300....which was why I found it mystifying why SMRT retract/did not order the Citaro to hitch on SBST's back.</p>
              <p>Will MAN even be a mainstay in SMRT's fleet? If based on the past, I highly doubt so....that throws further doubt into the wisdom of purchasing these MAN buses and then switching back to Merc for eg.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I still am looking forward to seeing the MAN. I mean...we've had one or two MAN here and there all these while, here's something unprecedented.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>In the UK quite a few Volvo caught fire including some B7LA. O405s caught fire is due to poor maintenance such as leaky fuel pump spray diesel oil all over engine compartment(info from some drivers and official report like TIB1110S, which had a wrong fuel line installed) as well as manufacturing defect like the turbo oil lubrication system(official report both local and overseas). No idea for Volvo and Scania</p>

              <p>Just a tip. Whacking your trottle is good for the engine, surprisingly. However its not when you whack the gearbox. So i don't know for auto, if whacking trottle is good or not, since doing so will be good for one but detrimental for another i think? It's not a good habit to tickle the engine, say when the BC is early. Worse is the engine struggles in high gear. My experience with motorbike is this can bend your connecting rod, which overtime lead to worse engine vibration and failure.</p>

              <p>No problem.</p>
              <p>Ok, before people start accusing us of flaming. All these have
              no personal attacks what so ever.</p>
              <p>Now....let's talk.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>"Productivity" here was with reference to the justification for
              fare hikes. It struck me as very funny when SMRT claims it has been
              "trying" to improve productivity when in the end one BC ferries so
              few pax.</p>
              <p>SMRT has little experience with MAN buses. I would be guessing
              that servicing and indent and even driving the MAN etc etc will be
              a learning experience for everyone there. Of course I daren't say
              too much about future servicing costs, but we've had types that
              gave mainteinance headaches (Dennis products comes to mind)....and
              even the L113s are falling apart. While the bus's
              durability might indeed be dependant on the brand, the size of
              the spare parts market plays a major role rather than the mere
              <em>presence</em> of the market itself. There are many Scania buses
              in SG...but the 113s for SBST and SMRT were never known to be
              terribly reliable.</p>
              <p>SMRT's most reliable bus is the 0405....that is doubtless. My
              guess is that beyond the good old chassis, having 700 0405s in
              SBST played a role in this. MB would be commited in servicing this
              huge number of buses. Just about the other types in SMRT's fleet is
              falling apart, including the 0405Gs which turbocharges the 0405's
              engine making it more complex and forces it to work harder. I am
              not sure if servicing costs for all these types actually went down
              upon purchase. It also boils down to how SMRT BCs love to whack
              their buses.</p>
              <p>In short, you can have MAN as good as can be, but its not a
              given that the mainteinance costs will be reduced just because the
              order exceeds 100 or any given number. Perhaps to reduce
              mainteinance costs that way, you might be needing to exceed a large
              figure like 300....which was why I found it mystifying why SMRT
              retract/did not order the Citaro to hitch on SBST's back.</p>
              <p>Will MAN even be a mainstay in SMRT's fleet? If based on the
              past, I highly doubt so....that throws further doubt into the
              wisdom of purchasing these MAN buses and then switching back to
              Merc for eg.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I still am looking forward to seeing the MAN. I
              mean...we've had one or two MAN here and there all these while,
              here's something unprecedented.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I would'nt comment if smrt has been productive or not, in fact, i dont stand by both companies because i really feel that both smrt and sbst can and still have much room for improvements in many areas.</p>
              <p>With regard to smrt having zero MAN experience, and the spare parts market, don't forget MAN shares their components between buses and trucks. And where would you be able to find trained MAN trucks mechanics? We actually have over a thousand MAN trucks running around, and i would say they are being treated worse than how smrt sl treats their vehicles.</p>
              <p>I wonder too, why did SMRT not buy citaros. They are good workhorses and of high quality, just like the o405 has been, and proven in many countries all over the world. Possibily like lemon1974 has mention, STK gave them a really good deal/package.</p>
              <p>Well, i'll finally get to enjoy the turbo whistle which i missed after 2 years of hearing it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
