              <p><br> Hi. I'm not sure. Probably so. I wished they opt for a better
              quality European bodywork. In any case, what do you think of
              the sliding plug exit doors sytem of the MAN buses? Do you think
              that the design is seriously flawed? Is there an exit door system
              whereby, when the doors slide open, you can practically view the
              inside mechanisms? What if some idiot decided to try his luck and
              put his hand inside? I've seen the cover of the exit doors of the
              MAN A22 rattling when it's speeding. This is caused due to poor
              design and the fact that it was not secured properly.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, MAN currently do not offer it's integral Lion's City series on RHD configuration.

              <p>I agree, would rather SMRT to invest more on the bodywork rather than the engine. The A22 is also available in 280hp like the Citaro, so it makes no sense for SMRT to get the more pricey 320hp version, while getting a cheap bodywork to save costs. Singapore is not very hilly, and since the buses are limited to 60km/h, 250hp would already be sufficient.</p>

              <p>I agree, would rather SMRT to invest more on the bodywork rather
              than the engine. The A22 is also available in 280hp like the
              Citaro, so it makes no sense for SMRT to get the more pricey 320hp
              version, while getting a cheap bodywork to save costs. Singapore is
              not very hilly, and since the buses are limited to 60km/h, 250hp
              would already be sufficient.</p>
              <p>As for Masats sliding door system, it's feels cheap too, would
              be better if SMRT stick to the older outward swinging doors
              instead.</p>

              <p>i completely disagree with you on the engine part. getting a more powerful engine will save fuel costs in the long run (consider rising fuel prises) as it will labour less to acheive optimum performance. yes, buses are still limited to 60km/h but having a more powerful engine will make the bus more driveable, giving the driver an easier time driving and more power available to keep up with traffic or to overtake. the fuel consumption of lower horsepower and capacity citaros is pathetic compared to the man a22s or even b9tls.</p>

              <p>Not exactly true. The more powerful engine will only save fuel if the less powerful engine is running beyond it's optimum range. However, the converse also applies. If the more powerful engine is running under it's optimal range, it would also use up more fuel (i.e. most of the time at low rpms due to too little a load). The key is to find a optimal balance where the drivetrain would be most efficient for the type of terrain and service (city traffic or short distance high turnover, rural, highway) that the bus would operate on.</p>
              <p>The powerful engines scenario applies especially to large displacement engines, where the crankshaft of the engine would have to travel a longer distance at every cycle, thus being very inefficient, and space consuming due to the larger engine. Advanced systems such as intercoolers and variable geometry turbocharges do provide the ability to have a smaller displacement engine while maintaining similar power and torque levels.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, the more powerful the engine, the maintaience and consumerables costs is generally higher as there would be more stress on components. In such cases, oil and filter changes would have to be done more often. The engine could then be derated from it's original output to save costs and extend it's lifespan.</p>

              This is really an FAQ (frequently asked question) - what's the purpose of that "hair" on the Superlion for? 
              <p>
              SMRT Buses chose that Lion's City Hybrid design is due to the aesthetically pleasing design. It looks very sleek and eye-catching. The "hair" actually has a purpose - to hide the Denso airconditioning pod like how the original Lion's City Hybrid hides the high-performance capacitors used to store braking energy as well as the energy-management system. In the actual Hybrid bus, cool air is channelled to the capacitors through the front air ducts to cool the capacitors.

              Also, the Lion's City Hybrid design won the red dot award: product design 2011! Hope this kind of help answer this FAQ.

              <p>I am not too sure about the rattling, but there was once when i was on an A22 on 966 (forgot the rego), it was pouring outside. When the exit doors closed, rainwater spilled into the buss from the sliding mechanism of the doors, as the rain was collected by the tray like system on the door system. The people in the bus had to avoid the spill.. I wonder if this will affect the pulley / belt system in the long run..</p>

              at the sides, MAN logos in the interior, as well as the roof and
              side marker lights. In addition, the driver's cabin roof curve
              design is copied from MCV's bodywork and not from MAN.</p>
              <p>Hope the last 100 A22s use the updated MCV bodywork.</p>
