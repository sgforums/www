Your judgement doesn't serve any purpose but just an ant-sized voice. Who cares about what you said? Not as if your voice would make a huge impact on me? You have your own business to back u up, who knows they will also bring you down~~SIMPLY IDIOTS...</p>

              <p>Plus, do you think, by your position of an "in-charge"(or maybe not~) would allow you to prevent staff to spread rumours? Oh please..everyone have their mouth. Now you only listen to one "rumour", and you're simply acting like a moral-less valued "dog" here barking violently. What if there's tons of rumours? Would you be in the IMH after serval barking then? If the world is as easy as you said, I suggest you should reflect again~</p>
              <p>Just in-case your head go bersak shooting about me, I would LOVE to tell you this. I'm going with the flow, if you LOVE commenting about others(unreasonable manner), I would LOVE to do the same thing back~ Nobody LOATH to do this, but simply because of some people whom simply doesn't want to solve in a peaceful way, there's no choice but the HARSH way~~~ Simple as that</p>
