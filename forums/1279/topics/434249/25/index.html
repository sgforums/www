              <p>Dave, the k230ub in sg are too configured with a final drive ratio of 5.57:1 (but smaller tyres) and i believe that was to ensure full use of the 6 available gears and torque. It's interesting as to why the australian k230ub are too configured to this ratio, while having larger tyres and limited to 100km/h (compared to 60km/h in sg). Wouldn't the gearshifts occur after 1500rpm in this case? Some efficiency would have already been lost, if so. Having the 4.88 ratio on the australian k230ub won't work too, as startability would likely go to crap.</p>

              <p>Though SBST fleet is bigger and they should get more Citaros (as what you had said), but time shall proves everything. I believe by that time (when all 300 Citaros are on the road), people will no longer want to have more Citaros for SBST.</p>
              <p>As for SMRT, it will have to depend on whether they want double decks. If they rejected the offer of double decks, what's the use of those 12m single decks on the road when even one cannot pick up passengers during peak hours? That is one of the reasons I believe bendies are a part of everyday life.</p>

              <p>Dave, the k230ub in sg are too configured with a final drive
                  ratio of 5.57:1 (but smaller tyres) and i believe that was to
                  ensure full use of the 6 available gears and torque. It's
                  interesting as to why the australian k230ub are too configured to
                  this ratio, while having larger tyres and limited to 100km/h
                  (compared to 60km/h in sg). Wouldn't the gearshifts occur after
                  1500rpm in this case? Some efficiency would have already been lost,
                  if so. Having the 4.88 ratio on the australian k230ub won't
                  work too, as startability would likely go to crap.</p>

              <p>The selection of larger tyres has the same effect as selecting a taller final drive ratio - a tradeoff between acceleration capability and top speed capability.</p>
              <p>You're correct about the use of a 4.88:1 final drive ratio on a K230UB - the startability would be unacceptable.  That's why Scania has chosen to offer the 280hp engine rating as an absolute minimum.  The significantly higher torque of this engine variant (1400Nm compared to 1050Nm) ensures that startability and gradeability is improved despite the use of a taller final drive.  The extra torque also has the advantage of ensuring that the engine doesn't have to work as hard in any given topographical situation.  The use of TopoDyn on the ZF-Ecomat 4 transmission further strengthens this advantage.</p>

              <p>That's right, but for the Singapore market the taller final drive ratio and 280hp engines would be uncessary; as our transit buses don't go above 60km/h and operates mostly on roads without steep inclines. The short final drive ratio and smaller tyres alone should already allow the 230hp engine to provide sufficient torque for the terrain and loads, and up to the maximum speed of 60km/h in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Even though the road speed requirement in Singapore does not exceed 60 km/h, a taller final drive ratio may provide advantages that you wouldn't realise until you see the specific fuel consumption curves for the relevant engines.</p>
              <p>A shorter final drive ratio and/or smaller diameter tyres means that the engine needs to operate at a higher speed in order to achieve targetted road speeds in each gear.  This in turn leads to unnecessarily higher fuel consumption.</p>
              <p>As an example of how a tall final drive ratio and a high output engine can be beneficial, Sydney's Scania L113CRLs have a 3.80:1 final drive coupled to Scania's DSC 11 Euro 2 engine which outputs 310hp and 1315Nm.  These buses have amazing off-the-line performance despite being fitted with such a tall final drive and return well under 40L/100km in stop-start urban traffic - better than many of today's state-of-the-art buses.  The maximum road speed required for Sydney's city buses is 80 km/h.</p>
              <p>As you can see, it is vitally important that bus operators choose the correct final drive ratio for every given model of bus.  As for tyres, Australian operators prefer 11R 22.5 or 295/80R 22.5 sizes because they are far cheaper than the smaller 11/70R 22.5 and 275/70R 22.5 sizes.</p>

              <p>The 230hp output engine is a derating of the 280hp output engine, so it wouldn't be difficult for Scania to continue production of this variant.  The only thing is, Scania found that fuel consumption of the 230hp engine combined with a final drive ratio of 5.57:1 (to aid startability) in a K-UB is higher than the consumption of the 280hp engine combined with a final drive ratio of 4.88:1 under all conditions in an otherwise identical K-UB, so it makes no sense for operators to opt for the lower horsepower rating.</p>

              <p>Though SBST fleet is bigger and they should get more Citaros (as what you had said), but time shall proves everything. I believe by that time (when all 300 Citaros are on the road), people will no longer want to have more Citaros for SBST.</p>
              <p>As for SMRT, it will have to depend on whether they want double decks. If they rejected the offer of double decks, what's the use of those 12m single decks on the road when even one cannot pick up passengers during peak hours? That is one of the reasons I believe bendies are a part of everyday life.</p>

              <p>300 Citaros is nothing as compared to 1100 K230UBs, so more people will want more Citaros, especially it if fully low floor.</p>
              <p>Currently there are only 2 low floor models in Singapore being purchased, Mercedes Benz Citaro and MAN A22. Since SBST has already engage Mercedes Benz for new Citaros, it is logical for them to get more Citaros in future. And Citaros are better than A22 because A22 has a crooked rear narrow aisle, which is even worse than the Citaro. Volvo B9TL full low floor configuration is the best of the 3 but is a double decker chassis. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for SMRT double deckers, it is still best for them to use double deckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">As mentioned by someone, feeder services will have more stringent  frequencies after the new QC requirements. More buses on a feeder service means better frequncies which means number of passengers in a bus will be lesser. Thus it is useless to use bendies if they are not fully utilised all the time, which in turn waste more fuel and road space, and increase operating costs. And double deckers are more suitable for space tight city roads and using bendies on city routes like 190 are definately hogging other buses schedules instead.</p>
