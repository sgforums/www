              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now I see the cost per unit.....I gotta ask again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">You mean <em>this</em> justifies ANY fare hike?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Sorry. But SMRT is disappointing me even if I like MAN....its a rather wasteful purchase when what we need are really higher capacity buses....otherwise buses that are not too expensive and at least have a larger spare-parts market here that can help lower depreciation costs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Doubtless SMRT's purchase might lower the costs for SBST if it decides to purchase MAN...but why SMRT did not follow up with larger orders on the Citaro is really mystifying especially since SBST is already doing it a favour with a large Citaro order.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In short, SMRT's decision gets an F from me again. 10 Citaros? 10 BYDs? Now 100++ MAN.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">How is this productive, you ask me? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">SBST gets my support for the fare hike. <strong>NOT</strong> SMRT. Uber disappointing with what I've been hearing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Maybe someone should help justify this purchase and help restore any faith in SMRT in me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">But before that:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Here's what our transport minister has to say:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Transport Minister pointed out that, an entity that depends on Government funding and which operates on a cost-recovery basis, "would have little incentive to keep costs down".<br><br>Said Mr Lui: "Cost increases will be passed on to commuters. Over time, this will lead to higher costs for the same level of service, which means commuters pay higher - and not lower - fares. Not only would people have to pay more, nationalising the operators could result in a stagnation of service quality or efficiency over time."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">What nonsense. I'm not buying WP's arguments either. The problem here doesn't lie with privatisation but with who's actually calling the shots and the how the market is regulated! You can nationalise and give crappy services, but you can also privatise and still give crappy services!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Are our politicians treating people like us as bystanding idiots?</span></span></p>

              <p>Cost per unit? Do you have accurate and confirmed number of buses this 65mil is worth? Everything here is speculation. Look at smrt's annual report for some info on their plan on fleet replacement and expansion.</p>
              <p>Why not citaro? If smrt needs buses asap, can they wait for 300 sbst citaros to complete production and delivery? Don't forget there might already be other companies ordering their buses from MB already. If it takes about 1 year to queue for the order, is it still viable to buy citaros? These are things that companies have to decide that's not quite visible to the general public. STK on the other hand, can simply buy imported chassis imported kits to build locally, at any time and rate they want.</p>

              <p><br>Which was why I seek clarification at the end. BUT....its also a known fact that MAN was never known to be cheap to start with.</p>
              <p>Ok, so where's the "remaining" Citaro purported to have been purchased as raised by lemon1974? Nobody has yet to answer that.</p>
              <p>So why didn't SMRT build on that earlier Citaro order? And then if we follow your logic (prefectly logical), then SMRT's purchase and earlier trial might have convinced SBST to put bulk order, thereby preventing SMRT access to Citaros in quick order....like that is lagi LPPL right? Because even if SBST's purchase wasn't directly related, it is inextricably linked because the trial and purchase would have vindicated the Citaro (hmmm yes, nice bus =&gt; let's buy it!)</p>
              <p>Costs aside. Where's my DDs and bendies?</p>
              <p>Why SDs again?</p>
              <p>You are convinced by SMRT's claim at "trying to be productive"? I am far from being impressed. SBST certainly doesn't advertise 160/170 on its NEL. *snorts*</p>
              <p>But I like the MAN. How ironic.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I just think SMRT's is doing a half-baked job. And this is but a reflection of it.</p>
