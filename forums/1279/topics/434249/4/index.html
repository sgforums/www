              <p>Being the non-integral A22 chassis, MAN will *NOT* be providing the bodywork for your buses.  Integral MAN standard low-floor city buses have the internal designation of A21.  One would assume that the units acquited by SMRT will be similar to the demonstrator, so you will be getting NL 323 Fs.  The MAN D 2066 LUH in Euro 5/EEV form is a very responsive engine with all the latest technologies including Common Rail Injection and twin-stage turbocharging.  These engines have power all over the rev range and should serve Singapore well.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmmm... If you claim you have a photo which in turns act as proof of evidence that the production MAN buses are Gemilang bodied, i am truly, utterly disappointed with SMRT Buses. The demo MAN with MCV Evolution bodywork to me is a stepping stone. At least, SBS Transit have their Wright bodied B9TLs and if SMRT Buses went ahead with MCV Evolution for their production MAN buses, we get to see two different types of European bodywork after a long absence. Unfortunately, i can't seem to comprehend the fact that they chose Gemilang after 1100 Scania K230UBs and 134 Mercedes Benz OC500LE to prove that Gemilang bodied buses aren't exactly the way to go for city buses, especially if the chassis are good quality ones, but bodied by cheap quality Asian made bodywork. Well, i suppose it all boils down to cost cutting measures and profits at the end of the day. Can't say much for SBS Transit. At least, they're willing to invest in double deckers with good quality European bodywork and even a mass purchase of the world wide popular: Mercedes Benz 0530 Citaro, despite the fact SMRT trialled one bus and subsequently, bought only 10 miserable units. Sigh......</p></div>

              <p>Well, the gemilang MAN running on discovery bay services are still pretty good up till today. But of course with good quality bodies, buses tend to stay younger... E.g. (hispano o405 vs dm umw lances)</p>

              <p><br>I won't agree about the UMW Lance actually! Haha. But I suspect its the chassis rather than the body. But the M'sian Lance.....no comments.</p>
              <p>But yes. Good solid bodies like the DM bodies, Hispano are of course desirable.</p>
              <p>But "cheap, better, faster" now. What to do?</p>
              <p>As long as the Gemilang body doesn't become Gemiland bodies during the journey, I'm ok with it.</p>

              No matter it uses Gemilang bodies or MCV evolution bodies, as long as they are under SMRT kind of maintainance standards, eventually they will become crap buses. No need to expect too much from them, you will be disappointed most of the times. 
              Look at the maintenance standards of the current fleet, even about half of the ELBO Scanias were forced to retire early.
