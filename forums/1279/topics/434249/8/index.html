              <p>How I wish their adeptness in basking in the media spotlight be replicated to other areas of their operation and procurement of larger capacity buses. The refurbed buses (DAFs/L113s) and habits, for some reason, are a little tat noisy.</p>

              <p>Well to be honest, although double decks should be bought for increasing capcity, smrtb will probably not need it anymore when downtown line opens 4 years down in 2015.</p>
              <p>Almost all of their high capcity routes (especially those plying bpj) would have lost some or most of their capacity to sbst's dtl. By then would have only left a few services like 851, 969 etc that can really make use of dds. Of course, that is unless u want feeder services to use dds too, but it seems most are coping well with bendies for now.</p>

              <p>Although im not clear who u are replying to since you never quote anyone and i did not mention anything about smrt improving its bus or rail services at all (and its quite clear that they have little or no interest to improve), but still...</p>
              <p>There are always places trains cant cover, which is why buses are needed. In the case of NUS, its not always feasible to walk from the ccl stations to many of the schools as you have correctly pointed out. Thats why 95 96 151 and the shuttles are still needed to bring people around. I dont see it as competiting against the ccl, but more of complementing it by increasing capacity of buses between kent ridge station and schools, and thats a good thing for commuters.</p>
              <p>As for clear and direct competition between smrt and sbst, my view is that it only happens when many commuters who originally uses smrt trains to travel long distances now switches to take sbst bus or rail services instead. In that case, then the big chunk of fare would go into sbst's pockets.</p>
              <p>And i fully agree on your point that smrt is not keen to improve its services, at least for now. Their buses can never compete directly with sbst, frequency is too sparse, and too little services. But of course for smrt areas, then its not an issue since theres not much competing services, so they dont really see why they need to "snatch passengers" from the other company. Their trains are basically a monopoly, and for most cases between mrt-mrt stations, buses either take a longer time, or cost more (other than TPE services and some other rare ones). Until dtl is completed, its unlikely that they would improve since no one is there to snatch a significant amount of pax away. So why would they need to improve that?</p>
              <p>My 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Actually, imo, CCL @ KR actually is a major competitor with the NUS-plying buses, 10, 143, 30, 95, 96 (to a less extent than 95). I'm not too familiar with the AYE stop buses though. These buses do not bring people to Kent Ridge Station. Quite the contrary, they draw people away from there.</p>
              <p>Is it coincidental that these services have also received upgrades before CCL opens? I dont think so. 33 and to a less extent, 151 have more or less fallen aside in the upgrades since they aren't involved that much. 151 may have plenty of K230UBs, but actually half the time, I take B10Ms....not that I complain with many seats to choose from.

              <p>Although this is getting quite off-topic and deserves a new thread for it, i shall put in my final 2 cents.</p>
              <p>The key difference between how smrt's ccl and sbst's dtl affects travel patterns wont be clearly shown now, but its not easy to compare between this two.</p>
              <p>sbst might have boosted fleet upgrades now for kent ridge and nus, but the thing is does ccl really eat into the share of pax coming from east and city (10,30,33,143)? Maybe for the portion between hbf till kent ridge yes, but anyone who used to take the ewl into bouna vista and xfer to 95 would still do this. It makes no sense for anyone to take ccl for 2 stops and end up having to walk more. This will probably stay this way until ccl stage 6/7 completes the circle and makes travelling faster to city from the west using ccl.</p>
              <p>But for dtl, its not the same because dtl connects directly into the heart of cbd. No matter how aggressive smrt makes it services, bpj would still lose significant amount of pax to dtl, just because people need to go downtown core for work and taking train would be easily the most direct way. Same for those going anywhere towards city, its all covered by dtl.</p>
              <p>However having said all this, what matters most is the balance of the whole system. No one knows whats going to happen when sbst operates dtl. My concern is that routes operating along it will get rationalised, or given low frequency so more people moves to take the trains. And its mostly sbst's services too (except panjang). I hope the whole bus network wont break up into sections, such that theres no longer direct services that compete with rail lines. Its already pretty much the case for places like sengkang, punggol, woodlands, etc, where it pretty much forces ppl to take trains otherwise the bus journey takes easily 20 to 30mins more. Maybe those living in these sk/pg should comment in another thread how they go to places like orchard, kallang, or other places where its just slightly off the NEL coverage by a little, since their bus services to city is really limited.</p>

              <p>NL323F. I heard the last number of the model stands for the generation of the model, since there is a NL262F in Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>Well to be honest, although double decks should be bought for increasing capcity, smrtb will probably not need it anymore when downtown line opens 4 years down in 2015.</p>
              <p>Almost all of their high capcity routes (especially those plying bpj) would have lost some or most of their capacity to sbst's dtl. By then would have only left a few services like 851, 969 etc that can really make use of dds. Of course, that is unless u want feeder services to use dds too, but it seems most are coping well with bendies for now.</p>
