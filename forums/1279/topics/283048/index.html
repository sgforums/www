Driver tried to accelerate but engine died off. He restarted but cannot work.<br><br>6:17am: Driver tells everyone to alight. The entrance door was fully opened but the 2 exit doors were stuck halfway. Apparently someone kicked the exit door at the trailer open, and everyone was able to alight, but the few who were at the front had to pull some bigger sized passengers out. By then the door was fully opened too. The driver saw everybody come out and he opened the engine cover<br><br>6:21am: Passengers made to wait at the road at the bus stop. TIB1106E from 913 came and driver flagged down the bus for passengers. Those people on TIB1106E were shocked on the number of people who were coming in. Luckily the last person of the bus was able to board it and stood at the door. Passengers from TIB1049L are not required to tap on the reader. Apparently some Volgren bendy passed by and horned at thhe innocent driver from TIB1106E<br><br>6:28am: TIB1106E reached the interchange. </blockquote>Quoted from my blog <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

SBS 0074M was on it's final AM Peak trip to the industrial parks in Tampines when the bus came to a stop right before filtering into the right extreme side and then turning into Tampines Street 92.<br>2. The BC was believed to have encountered some transmission problem as he was seen stuck with the controls at the driver's cabin.<br>3. At about 0943 hrs, he opened the front door and stood up, probably to ask the passengers to get down the bus. After that, I don't know what happened.<br>4. As of now, I am currently unsure of the fate of SBS 0074M. I think that another Scania or SBS 8015G will be coming to do cameo on Service 68 later during the evening.</div>
