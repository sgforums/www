The VSO had no passenges on board, while the DT had some passengers. The two fatalities were caused by the breaking of the front portion of the bus and they were thrown out and went under the vehicle. The VSO was supposed to give way at a junction to let the DT go straight, but instead proceeded and collided with the DT, which itself was possibly traveling at high/very high speed. The NWFB BC was convicted of dangerous driving leading to fatalities and charged by the police. He had started work at four in the afternoon, had a break at nine and suppose to 'swing' (off work) at one thirty in the morning the next day. At the time of the accident, due to the absence of passengers on the bus, it was suspected by the police that he slacked off and might have even forgotten about stopping and giving way, which lead to the accident.</div>
