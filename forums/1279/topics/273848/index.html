Its worse there. I consider 966 good enough already as a regular commuter of 911 and occasional commuter of 966. My friends told me that TIB453J (spare bus at Woodlands Dpeot) had bugs falling down from no where in the bus whenever it tilts<br><br>Second point: Bus engine is the same across all services which has this type of bus, no matter you are riding on 966 or 190 (if you get the normal buses). If you don't like it there's no other choice other than sitting at the front instead of the back, since the buses used are the same<br><br>Third point: I think it was amended to suit PTC's territorial rule. I haven't took 966 ever since the amendment though.<br><br>Last point: The seats of SMRT and SBST buses are different. SMRT uses fur seats and thats why they trap dust. But to me the SMRT seats tend to be more comforatble as they are indivdual seats. Hated the fact that people like to squeeze their way to you on SBST buses</div>
