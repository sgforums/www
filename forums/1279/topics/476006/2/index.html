              Sometimes, we all wish the â€ª#â€Žbusâ€¬ â€ª#â€Žcaptainsâ€¬ would drive a little faster, or not waste time driving slowly for us to reach our destinations earlier.
              <p>
              The bus captains have a timetable to adhere to - they can't be too early or too late.

              <p><br>The <strong>first </strong>and <strong>third</strong> point is different.<br><br>The first point refers to the <strong>bus drivers </strong>that repeatedly tell passengers to move in when clearly, once or twice is enough, because I believe nobody is that dumb at understanding clear, flat-out english , "Move inside, move in to the back pls. Thanks ah, sorry ah." At times, the bus drivers spend a good 20 seconds telling the passengers to move in while the bus idles at the same position. Nobody moves, everybody stills. This is a problem, a lot of effective time has been eaten up in travelling if it occurs at every bus stop.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the third point refers to <strong>stubborn passengers</strong> themselves who refuse to move in. The third point focuses on the inconsiderate commuters, who have not thought of the welfare of other commuters who want to board the bus.</p>
