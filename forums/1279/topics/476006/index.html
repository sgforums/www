              <p>I feel that if the public buses' exit doors are located at the front and back end just like those private buses, those people who are standing will choose to move to the back so that they can exit easily.</p>
              <p>Also just wondered why segway is not allowed in Singapore? I think just like bicycle at least it will be faster as long as the user did use it for dangerous stunt</p>

              <p>1) The broken record works. People move in. </p>
              <p>2) Learn to run for the bus. Or walk to the previous bus-stop.</p>

              <p>You must be one of those gullible sheeps who takes everything heard from the the government as a fact. I am not here to start a political fight, it is extremely childish and will get us nowhere.</p>
              <p><em>"if you hate public transport in Singapore, you cannot survive anywhere else in the world. " </em>shows your immaturity and prehaps, too much of the 'goodie' advice from people, which are, "<em>If you cannot stop people from bullying you in school, you cannot survive in the real world. Transfer also doesn't work. You are the problem." </em></p>
              <p>Have you heard of an idea name "adaptability"? That is that we change ourselves to better suit the enviornment. In UK, it is cheaper for you to get a car compared to Singapore, so ditch the PT and get the car.</p>
              <p>BTW, the crowd is horrible especially during peak hours on the train. Stand near the door and you become a sardine. Stand in the middle of the carriage and have difficultly walking out. Every train ride is so frustrating and stressful. </p>

              <p>1) I don't know for you, but when bus 75 or 184 leaves from Bukit Panjang Interchange at my area, TON of Ngee Ann students board it and I can tell you from my observation, the broken record is mildly effective. Stubborn students continue to stand there not moving in at all. It barely works IMHO. This is opinionated based, you might think its very effective around your area, but as far as I'm concerned, in my routined-based bus taking I do nearly daily, it barely does.<br><br>2) Bro. Run for the bus? What are you talking about? I stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus and I see at times , 4 or 5 of them flash past across me with fully boarded passengers. Walking to the previous bus-stop doesn't help. 75 and 184, being the fully boarded buses during peak hours for Ngee Ann students , doesn't really help when you walk to the previous bus stops. I can tell you, even walking 2 previous bus stops won't help either. <br><br>3) From what I know , I'm not telling passengers to squeeze like freaking sardines trapped in a can. I'm telling you to move to a level where you're still able to have some personal space. This creates a fair treatment for other passengers to board. Yes, you may have your sketchbook blablabla and stuff , you might find difficulty, but I'm sure most bus captains would allow you to alight before they move off, don't they? <br><br>^ I did make reference to the videos I made, so pardon me if you didn't understand any of the context. Also, this is not personal. I'm stating my opinion. Please do not take it as a form of personal attack! I greatly appreciate discussion. Thank you. :)<br>Cheers!</p>
