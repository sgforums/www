Telling how bad the pic is is one thing, but how to improve is another. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just like a teacher scolding a student for making a mistake. How is the student supposed to improve without the teacher's help?</div></blockquote>Hmm okay... Well, let me give u some advices as to how to improve it..<br><br>Angle wise, if you really desire to get a very nice angle pix, find a spot which has wide angle area and not limited angles like most bus stops with the roof cut off the bus most of the time in your photos.. But night shot wise, bus stop may be 1 of the better ones if you do not have a tripod and if it's really rare cameo like what I posted below:<br><br><img src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/tib967t/2696_161_night_z8.jpg"><br>For this, I make use of the rallings near a canel at Hougang Ave 10. =)<br><br><img src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/tib967t/0195_975_z8.jpg"><br>For this, I would place my camera onto the floor and took it. This kind of (floor) shots, it's best to do it only when there's really nice (and rare?) cameos which you really want to go for it, and not a bus stop when there's a lot of people.<br><br>Of course, day shot wise, never ever will I place my camera onto the floor because shuttle speed is much more faster and you do not need a base to stabilise your camera (just like tripod).<br><br>Sunlight wise, learn to "trial and error", experiment it, experience it, and find out which is the spot which you can get a better sunlight direction pix.. For this, you really need a lot of practice..<br><br><img src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/tib967t/2696_151_day_z8.jpg"><br>Taken outside Woodlands Regional Interchange, notice the shadow of the bus. The shadow should not face in front and left (for nearside shots) / right (for offside shots) of the bus. Shadow of the bus should face the opposite of what I mentioned in my previous statement, just like the pix I posted above.<br><br><img src="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y242/tib967t/7307_72_z14.jpg"><br>For this, it's for offside pix of the bus. Take note of the shadow of this one above also, from there, you can practice until you get to find a nice spot which can allows you to have nice angle and sunlight pix..<br><br>This applies to those who posted the same kind of standard pix as his.. Gambatte to everyone here!! Trust me, 1 fine day when your pix has the same standard as mine (or even better), you will feel the sense of satisfication for the amount of effort that you put in..<br><br>Cheers =)</div>

Hence I don't understand why you are telling me that you never scold them or be sarcastic. I think there is quite a difference from being rude and scolding, of which I think your post contained more of the former than the latter. Whatever the case, if that is your way of teaching, so be it, its your choice.</div>

Females think that if you place your camera on the floor, it will invade their privacy.<br><br>Instead, always bring a tripod if you are planning to shoot till the night.

I use to think that those photo I shoot are good, not until I get to ask someone who is more experienced. Their comments are the most neutral and won't care about your feelings too, they often come harsh and difficult to accept. Even with a photo that you guys shot up a few replies would be turned down by experts as 'simple' and 'not creative'. I went through that stage too, until I find more creative and different angles, trust me, till now I am still looking for something more interesting. Skills, yeah, important, but luck is what I think is also part and parcel of a photographer's life. Same place, but different angle and timing and things turn out drastically different.</div>

I strongly discourage using a slim camera. With bulkier ones, the performance of your shots are better. Look out for the zoom too-it can help you get closer to the bus. Buy one with a rotatable lens wherever desired (Just like my Nikon Coolpix S4 which I bought a year ago).</div></blockquote>I have seen some very decent photos taken with a handphone camera as compared to shots using a DSLR. The main advantage of a bulkier camera is just to be able to grasp it more firmly thus allowing for a lower shuttle speed to be used and thus reducing the likelihood of blur shots.<br><br>I guess rotatable lens is just one's preference. For me I find it as a "good to have" but not essential as I almost never wished I had it when shooting buses.</div>

Or camera failing to track the movement of the bus correctly.<br><br>The problem with taking photos into the sun is that it will result in uncomfortably asymmetrical lighting in the photo. Part of the bus might blend into the background due to overexposure (due to the lower shutter speed) and reflection from the sun, and some parts though correctly exposed, would be clearly in shadow. Thus in this case I personally feel that shooting with the sun behind one in the correct direction would produce a photo with a  more even lighting that is more comfortable to look at.<br><br>Whilst is very true in landscape shots etc to make use of shadows etc, the really good ones I have seen for buses are those with a very clear background thus allowing the sihoulette of the shape of the bus to show up very clearly. The problem lies in finding the perfect location, something which is very difficult in urban Singapore (and trees &amp; lamposts where there isn't).<br><br></div>
