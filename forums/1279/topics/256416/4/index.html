You originally intended to photograph the bus, but you ended up focusing on the garbage collection vehicle, as well as a car and a taxi in the background. Is your the subject the bus itself, or is it the differences between the bus and the garbage collection vehicle?<br><br>It would help if you capture something else in the photograph that can be related to a bus - the passengers, the driver, a bus stop, or another bus,, along with the bus if you are taking in more than two subjects at the same time. Try to make unrelated elements anecdotal to the overall subject of the picture. Take, for example, <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/9534990/" rel="nofollow">this bus photograph of a bus by an artistic photographer</a>; superficially, to everyone (even to us bus fans - we know that SBS 3703L is a route 222 perm, and still is), this photograph is nothing special. However, once you start studying the photograph you will notice how it's special; it not only captures the bus (which is deliberately off-centre), it captures a nice variety of commuters who are about to embark on the bus as well (which, taken as a whole, is again slightly off-centre). The surroundings is a bus stop (again, bus-related element), and on the bus stop, we see an anecdotal element which in itself is part of a subject-related element (the Newman magazine poster (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ) on the bus stop). All in all, it makes for a very-well composited picture, and it describes the subject of the picture very well and in many subtle, multiple-layer ways.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sBs_boy:</div><div class="quote_body">Enjoy<br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v303/crybaby89/IMG_3164_1.jpg"><br>All Photos Â© sBs_Boy.<br></div></blockquote>This is yet another example of bus photography (indeed, a photography of any physically huge subject) that I like. We see that there are two subjects in this photograph - SBS 9330P, and an unidentified B9TL on route 80. Instead of giving them the same level of importance as the subject of the photograph (which would make it distracting, especially if they don't appear as "one" ), sBs_boy has made use of perspective to make SBS 9330P, the main subject of the photograph, stand out from the picture, while relegating the B9TL to the near background to make it a secondary subject. For the main subject, he made use of perspective to "enlarge" SBS 9330P to make it more grand and imposing. To make use of such perspective, he made use of the lightning conditions (which are very important in these kind of pictures); in this picture, the light source (sunlight) was coming from behind the photographer, and is shining almost (but not quite) directly on SBS 9330P, which makes the front of the bus stand out. He also captured a little of the side of the bus; from this angle, the perspective of the side of the bus is exaggerated, which makes the front of the bus look more impressive. The only flaw, in my opinion, is that the front of the bus has a bit too much glare, somewhat washing out the most important part of the subject. As for the secondary subject - the B9TL - he gave it a slightly different perspective, facing a bit more away (but still in the same general direction) as the main subject; this makes it look like it is languishing in the background, yet, makes it not too deep "inside" the background. The reflected gleam and point of sunlight on the B9TL gives tit a nice additional touch, as if it is proudly showing off it's own grandeur even though it's secondary in the photograph. Background-wise, the sky makes for a clean, undistracting background, with minimal noise - save for the anecdotally-placed HDB apartments to the top right of the photograph's background; from this perspective, it looks as if the apartment is watching over or spying on the buses, which makes for an interesting, if not amusing touch.<br><br>I have seen many photographs of buses before, and the best ones make very good use of lightning and perspective; keep that in mind when photographing buses.<br><br>(First time ever commenting on the artistic merits of a bus photograph  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</div>

Let the  (more experienced) me give you some tips... . It can't pass much off as abstract....my point is that picture is just awful. In black and white it can pass off as a social studies question. Seriously. Pictures speaks a thousand words, as one of my blog entries is.<br>Abstract " <span style="font-style: italic;">Fine Arts. a. of or pertaining to the formal aspect of art, emphasizing lines, colors, generalized or geometrical forms, etc., esp. with reference to their relationship to one another </span> "<br><img src><br><br>I <strong>do not have a bus picture to make my point at the moment</strong> regarding the above comments. <strong>(Just got my N73 but haven't snap any buses yet. Still familiarising).</strong><br>1) The background actually starts around the middle of the picture. The bridge starts in the middle and ends towards the horizon. It is simple "line" that is drawn to seperate the foreground and the background. Also there are the 2 PSA container mover at the side of the picture, "overlooking" the 2 boats. It's just like the above picture where the HDB is also peeping @ the buses. Also, from this picture one can akin to a family, where the dad and mum are by the pool and the boats are the children playing in the water. Also, the photographer is standing by the foreground, and it looks as if though he is also overlooking the two boats with the two PSA container movers.<br><br>2) The focus is on the 2 boats. The front boat is the subject while the back boat is the secondary object. Like the two DD buses in the post above that are taken in an angular shot, the back boat is showing off its side even though it is not the main subject. (Just like the B9TL). The lighting is slightly darker as the skies are overcast. If it was taken in a brighter condition it should turn out better.<br><br>3) No comparisions are made at all.<br><br>If this was a bus picture it may turn out nicer  as it can show the buses working despite the clouds are overcast . Overall this picture recieves a 7.3/ 10 (due to lighting and gloomier atmosphere which made the picture slightly duller).<br>Just my $0.02</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Alright, you might find me pretty hard on this but this is not the first day that I have come out to shoot photographs, in this picture I would also want to show that photoshop can create much illusions too, this picture is heavily cropped.<br>Your photo of the boats, well, I really say that its just another tourist snapshot, any one can make. Can you sit on a rock outside Bedok Interchange for half a day and shoot better photos? If you only restrict your photos to snapshots, man, you can just go back (since you say you are not an amateur).<br>It would be funny for you to feel that I am a kid, if you really did no harm admitting. Come on, photograhy is about chance and patience. I have lots of patience, I dare to admit, hence I can get the photo, tell me, how often do you see the collector machine and a bus side by side?<br>Anyways thanks for the critics, I learn through this way, but just don't think that its easy to own people with a handphone, I started out using flim cameras more than 10 years ago when I was in primary school, used a compact digital camera for more than 4 years and a DSLR for almost half that time. Experience is important in photography. I respect my own seniors, who shoot thousands and thousands of photos more than me... Do think twice about being really ctritical on people, this is not Clubsnap...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by F_B_I:<br><strong><br><br>Oh by the way, i think you may be an amatuer photographer. Let the  (more experienced) me give you some tips... . It can't pass much off as abstract....my point is that picture is just awful. In black and white it can pass off as a social studies question. Seriously. Pictures speaks a thousand words, as one of my blog entries is.<br>Abstract " <span style="font-style: italic;">Fine Arts. a. of or pertaining to the formal aspect of art, emphasizing lines, colors, generalized or geometrical forms, etc., esp. with reference to their relationship to one another </span> "<br><img src="http://img480.imageshack.us/img480/4117/dsc00583pp4.jpg"><br><br>I [b]do not have a bus picture to make my point at the moment</strong> regarding the above comments. <strong>(Just got my N73 but haven't snap any buses yet. Still familiarising).</strong><br>1) The background actually starts around the middle of the picture. The bridge starts in the middle and ends towards the horizon. It is simple "line" that is drawn to seperate the foreground and the background. Also there are the 2 PSA container mover at the side of the picture, "overlooking" the 2 boats. It's just like the above picture where the HDB is also peeping @ the buses. Also, from this picture one can akin to a family, where the dad and mum are by the pool and the boats are the children playing in the water. Also, the photographer is standing by the foreground, and it looks as if though he is also overlooking the two boats with the two PSA container movers.<br><br>2) The focus is on the 2 boats. The front boat is the subject while the back boat is the secondary object. Like the two DD buses in the post above that are taken in an angular shot, the back boat is showing off its side even though it is not the main subject. (Just like the B9TL). The lighting is slightly darker as the skies are overcast. If it was taken in a brighter condition it should turn out better.<br><br>3) No comparisions are made at all.<br><br>If this was a bus picture it may turn out nicer  as it can show the buses working despite the clouds are overcast . Overall this picture recieves a 7.3/ 10 (due to lighting and gloomier atmosphere which made the picture slightly duller).<br>Just my $0.02[/b]</blockquote>If you are a professional photographer I would think I'm a celebrity photographer then.<br><br>1) The railing at the bottom left corner of the picture is absolutely distracting. A simple crop would get rid of it; it serves no purpose and is unrelated to the overall theme of the picture.<br><br>2) I'll have to agree with 767400 for this - its none other than a touristy snapshot. However, this picture violates the very thing which the rule of thirds aims to avoid. - By putting the subject (ie the 2 boats) right smack in the middle of the picture.<br><br>What does the boats show? The 2 buses in the shot above have a common aim - both preparing to head west with the bus in the outer lane overtaking the one in the inner lane thus showing some sense of urgency - a prevalent condition in the public bus industry. One boat point towards Vivocity and the other boat pointing to the right - with no activity (ie water trails) at all to suggest what it is doing.<br><br>If I were you, I would use the rule of thirds to put the boat more to the right of the picture, near the 1/3 from the right of the picture. My first impression of the picture was "wow, how big the gap between Sentosa &amp; the mainland is".<br><br>3) The main subject is far too small to catch my attention. Zoom in more to enlarge the subject, and if need be, remove the trees and the boardwalk at the lower left hand corner of the picture - it isn't related to the picture anyway.<br><br>4) Container handling cranes overlooking the boats? I roughly get what you mean, but container cranes &amp; small boats *just* don't go together. Furthermore, the Sentosa Express track that is seperating the cranes &amp; the boats further distances the link between these 2 subjects visually. There is not really a need to seperate the background &amp; foreground - the best photos allows viewers to easily differentiate the foreground &amp; background easily yet the foreground &amp; background complements each other and isn't jarring.<br><br>5) I would be glad that it was overcast as it produced a more balanced lighting throughout the picture. However, it needs more contrast &amp; saturation...put it simply it just doesn't have the "punch".<br><br>And if you haven't already realised, it is actually backlit (note the Sentosa gate tower is in shadow facing you), ie you are shooting into the sun, which is already a strict no-no.<br><br>5) And last but not least, your photo is unlevel. It needs some minor rotation anticlockwise - take reference from the 2 "Sentosa" gate towers near the centre of the picture.<br><br>Take a hard look and if you wish to criticise others, do come up with a better photo at least. And an excuse as not being familiar with a camera phone hardly shows that you have any pride in your work.</div>
