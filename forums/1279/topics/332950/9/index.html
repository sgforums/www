              <p>For the OAC Nissan UDs it is good for the Malaysian companies to buy over them to deploy on the resort shuttles too. Places like Cameron Highlands, Pulau Tioman, Langkawi, Pangkor may need such buses as some places are currently still using NAC buses which are over 20 years old.</p>
              <p>Whereas the CAC ones...hmm...they might just convert to non air-con, just switch off aircon and open window <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.</p>

              <p>By looking at those pics posted by manjieass, it is really a pity to see them being scrapped off just like that though the CAC interiors are really in bad conditions. Hopefully SMRT could just sell them off to other places like Bintan and Batam, perhaps to the kampungs in Malaysia too. I believe that the villagers living there will be happy to get air-conditioned buses. In fact I have even seen some buses in Malaysia, they are non air-conditioned and furthermore they seem to be even older than the SMRT's Nissan UD fleets.</p>
              <p>Some examples of such buses in Malaysia...They are just like the old school buses which I remembered taking everyday to school way back in the early 1990s.</p>

              <p>yup the interior of cac is really bad but oac are stil pretty good imo esp the cloth seat type.. i’ll find out whether its for scrap not if yes maybe can salvage some parts such as side mirror or the ticket machine as memory..</p>

              <p>Yah.the OACs are in very good condition.the seats are just so nice.i just took CSS179H on 975 two weeks ago.its perfomance was fantastic.after that i took TIB1254K on 178.its acceleration was good.but whenever the bus crossed a junction or went over something,the windows vibrated as if they will break into peices any moment.it was very scary.when the windows vibrated,the noise was terrible.and there were litter all over the bus.man,it was terrible.the back of the bus was very dirty as if it wasnt cleaned for months.there were tissue papers stuffed under the rear seats,tickets and food wrappers were thrown everywhere at the rear.what is WLDEP doing?<img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="">anyway,i feel that the OACs are maintained more better.its very sad to see them go.<img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt=""></p>

              <p><br>It's other countries their policy to use till the bus cannot be used. Singapore scraps/sells them so that they can also renew the fleet for a world class transport system. Although it is a pity to scrap it, it can't be helped.</p>

              <p>Even if I support Japanese technology much, the U31 buses are not the most fantastic... If you talk about the same era (1980-1990), there are also later models of the Spacerunner which feature V8 engines of up to 340PS (335 bhp), the U-UA520, introduced in 1990 and before the export model U31 RCN manufactured in 1993.</p>
              <p>There is this possiblilty that this batch of U31 RCN are made specially as an export requirement by the buyer and made long after production for this model has ended. U31 production lasted from 1980 to 1984, conforming to Showa 54 emission requirements and using the PE6H engine as benchmark.</p>
