              <p>And dun pass too many sarcastic comments when you haven't actually experienced the PRC drivers for yourself. If you think you can be a better bus driver compared to them, then why dun you become one yourself?</p>

Morning shift starts at 4:30 AM while those on night shift may end as late as 2:30 AM. Meal break is 30 mins and you get 10 mins break in between runs. Basic salary is $1200. In addition to the allowances and incentives, a BC could earn a gross salary of around $1650 - $2000 a month. Pretty neat, eh? However, there are many other work options available offering a similar pay package.</p></div>

              <p><br>I agree the basic pay package for SBST and SMRT has to increase, but comparing to them to SIA.  Goodness sake.  You can't compare SBST (and I don't mean Comfort Delgro) to SIA.  It's ludicruous.  The intrinsics of business in operating an international airline is different from running a local bus company.  It's like comparing apples to oranges.     </p>
              <p>And do you have actual evidence to support that the cost of living in Singapore is in the top 10 of the world?  Because if you look at this report here <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933749.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933749.html</a> , Singapore is at no 14.  So before you want to make a claim, pls either google or access some academic database to produce some hard facts before rattling off like a machine gun based on what you think.  Perhaps you should get out yourself a bit out of Singapore to decide if Singapore is really that expensive after all.</p>

              according to yesterday's ST article, it quoted BCs salary ranged up to $3500 per month which i don't believe!
              
              according to my conversations with many taxi drivers, they were reluctant to drive public buses because of many rude and unreasonable pax, adhere to tight schedules, get complaints and penalised by the companies easily. but they said they rather drive private buses, container trucks than public buses.
              
              talking of pay package, attract foreign talents (off-topic), i'd like to see plenty of foreigners and China nationals to take up jobs of doctors, surgeons, dentists, lawyers; hopefully to tense up competition and lower the costs. and hopefully China can become a potential strong competitior to compete against Microsoft by producing english version and cut down prices of softwares.

              <p><br>I'm sure carbikebus meant to say SATS, not SIA. Anyway, that is some interesting figures. If you noticed, SG's ranking jumped from 17th to 14th in just 1 year. And that was a year ago. Since then, GST has increased, fuel prices have increased, transport fares have increased and who knows what else have increased. Surely, SG would have jump up the rankings again and make it into the top 10 by now. So even if SG wasn't the most expensive city, we are certainly heading that way at a fast rate. Perhaps its just he SG desire to become No. 1 at everything. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Say the economy is fully employed, all 100 citizens have jobs,</p>
              <p>then one day 5 citizens decided to resign from their clerical positions</p>
              <p>and 5 citizens decided to resign from their jobs as "bus captains".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 5 bus drivers want to take up clerical positions, the 5 clerical</p>
              <p>officers want to remain in clerical line (just not in their previous company),</p>
              <p>nobody wants to go into bus driving they feel that the pay is too low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bus company decides to outsource to China because manpower is cheaper,</p>
              <p>ends up employing 5 bus drivers from China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the 5 clerical positions that was vacant will be competed by 10 citizens.</p>
              <p>Each of the 10 try to price themselves lower than the other so they can</p>
              <p>gain employment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately, the lower income earners end up with lower pay.</p>
              <p>Therefore increasing the income gap (Gini Coefficient) further.</p>
