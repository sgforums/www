              <p>The workshop will not plastic bag, there are SOP to follow. I am also not going to start a flame war but to share there many buses under AMK are leaking. 9161K. And 9147C has a wierd sound that is brushing the engine when I took it 2 mths ago.<br><br>Soon lee do have many gd bus to share like 9113A, 9131Y, 9109M, 9078T,9021G,9187L, If many were to notice this, you see most of these buses have a new layer of silicon on the side of the window to prevents leaks.</p>

              I am also not going to start a flame war but to share there many
              buses under AMK are leaking. 9161K. And 9147C has a wierd sound
              that is brushing the engine when I took it 2 mths ago.<br> <br> Soon lee do have many gd bus to share like 9113A,
              9131Y, 9109M, 9078T,9021G,9187L, If many were to notice this,
              you see most of these buses have a new layer of silicon on the side
              of the window to prevents leaks.</p>
