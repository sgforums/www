Services 23 is not that fast either, once I tried it and the VO went like a snail.... NOt sure 'bout the others though. 161, 168, 858 are really time- savers, along with 965 and 969, but I will object if they are converted to express services cos I have to pay so much more as I take them frequently. I don't think 960 is really that express, if you consider the route from Woodlands. If TIBS decide to convert 989 to express, then they can scrap the service cos the load factor now can be quite low at times..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, converting Sv. 989 to an express service would lead to it's eventual demise, but I do like taking Sv. 989 as it reaches the airport faster than if I had taken the MRT, however load factor leaves a lot to be desired(common to see only 2 or 3 other people on board, even during peak hours)</div>

It is essentially a limited stop bus service.  And even if it ran on the expressways, because it is GOVERNED, it doesn't feel like an express....it still takes you a long time to get into the CBD.  They should change the structure of the express services, making them limited stops from Sengkang to.......say, Hougang....then first SET DOWN stop (ie, no boarding from this stop onward) Selegie Rd, and all stops to Orchard Rd/Moulmein Rd.<br><br></div>
