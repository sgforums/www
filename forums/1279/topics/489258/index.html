            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">Many Changi Airport employees living in Pasir Ris and Loyang agonise over service 53, the only bus service that takes them to work.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">A typical journey in a car during the morning peak hour takes less than 15 minutes. However, the journey on service 53 takes a minimum of 40 minutes and, sometimes, more than an hour if one lives at the west end of Pasir Ris Street 1.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">It all boils down to insufficient trips and unreliable service.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;"> </p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">Service 53 starts from Bishan, and it goes through many housing estates before making its way to Pasir Ris. By then, the bus is packed and Pasir Ris commuters often cannot get on it.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">Because of the long route, there are often delays, and the timing between buses goes haywire. If one misses the bus, the wait for the next bus is around 20 minutes.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">Can SBS Transit ensure that the drivers pace themselves?</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">I also empathise with the residents in Loyang, the last bus stop before the bus gets on the Tampines Expressway. They often cannot board the bus as it is packed to the brim.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">The appeals of residents in Pasir Ris to their town representatives and MPs have not improved the situation. And there has been no word from SBS. Some commuters have suggested a peak-hour feeder bus between Pasir Ris and Changi Airport.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">I disagree that bus arrival times are now more accurate ("LTA: Bus arrival times more accurate now"; July 17). In fact, for the past two weeks, the Land Transport Authority's MyTransport.SG app shows outdated arrival times for service 53.</p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; padding-right: 107px; color: #333333; font-family: SelaneTen, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 27.142858505249px;">Tricia Kat Sze Yoong (Ms)</p>

              <p>If I am not wrong, last time the amendment to route 242 and the introduction of route 241 was because someone wrote a letter to the newspaper forum to ask for bus connection from Jurong West Street 91 to Pioneer MRT station.</p>
              <p>Last time route 243 also going to re-route to Pioneer MRT, but there are complains about the loss of bus connection at the bus stops at Jurong West Avenue 4 and Jurong West Street 61, especially the one at Street 61.</p>
              <p>^^ well, regarding 243, I have already come up with a suggestion before at the route suggestions thread. this is what I suggested:</p>
              <p>- 243 skip Ave 4 &gt; Street 61in G direction. instead, continue ply Pioneer Road North, then, Street 63 &gt; Street 65 &gt; Street 62 &gt; Street 61 &gt; Ave 4 &gt; return to current route.</p>
              <p>- new feeder. Boon Lay Int &gt; Street 64 &gt; Street 62 &gt; Street 61 &gt; Ave 4 &gt; Pioneer Road North &gt; Ave 5 &gt; Street 71 &gt; Street 61 &gt; Street 62 &gt; Street 64 &gt; Boon Lay Int.</p>
              <p>as good as a new route of around 1/2km, in the form of route amendment and route introduction.</p>
              <p>already requested for bus service to Pioneer MRT from Street 81 for so long. Hopefully someone can bring up my suggestion to the MPs and the LTA for consideration. Since anyway Pioneer Road North N7 also quite hard to take bus. Might as well, right?</p>

              <p>Same goes for Svc 5, 1 bus service for such high loading route. every morning and night bus fully pack like sardines. 2 DDs also can full when bunch up then the next bus behind become 10 to 20 mins or more gap during the morning peak. Emailed to sbst, they say cos pasir ris / loyang area jam thats why hard to travel.</p>

              <p>I stay in Pasir Ris, and right along Sv 53's route. So I think I can provide some feedback on this issue (although personally, I think she's kicking up a big fuss over something small..)<br><br>Anyway, the reason why it's such a problem for the Airport employees, mainly boils down to the fact that their crunch period (eg, their reporting for work timings &amp; end work timings) typically don't fall within the normal Peak Hours of most workers working elsewhere. <br><br>And this is a slight problem for many of the Airport-bound svcs (not just Sv 53 actually), because typically, SBST deploys more buses during Peak Hours (the BSEP &amp; BSRF schemes, additional S-shift buses for eg). But the "Peak period" for the CGA workers does not fall within the typical Peak Period of most of us working elsewhere. </p>
              <p>So it's super common to see packed Sv 53 buses to &amp; from CGA from 8pm onwards..and this happens typically everyday, including weekends. <br>And this 8pm-12am block is also the period in which you'll see the 15-20mins waiting time start to appear (the same 20mins wait she mentioned in the article), because quite a few of the S-Shifters go off-service after 8pm, and IIRC, the BSEP ones also.</p>
              <p>AM Peak isn't that bad though. </p>

              <p>True... but existing services can still manage the loads... it is also bcoz many people alight so space is created for people to board as well... + sv 39/53/109 all have got capacity upgrade quite regularly... so I wouldn't say dr 1 bus travellers are not given bus improvements.. </p>

              <p>Yes, exactly what you pointed out. That's why when I said that Sv 39 needs 20mins to get from my stop (the stop before the Community Centre one) to the end of PSR Dr 1 / PSR Dr 12 during AM Peak..idk why there are some who didn't believe my words..</p>

              <p>I think like this everyone can make complain. sv 53 has got

              <p>I stay in Pasir Ris, and right along Sv 53's route. So I think I
              can provide some feedback on this issue (although personally, I
              think she's kicking up a big fuss over something small..)<br> <br> Anyway, the reason why it's such a problem for the Airport
              employees, mainly boils down to the fact that their crunch period
              (eg, their reporting for work timings &amp; end work timings)
              typically don't fall within the normal Peak Hours of most workers
              working elsewhere. <br> <br> And this is a slight problem for many of the Airport-bound svcs
              (not just Sv 53 actually), because typically, SBST deploys more
              buses during Peak Hours (the BSEP &amp; BSRF schemes, additional
              S-shift buses for eg). But the "Peak period" for the CGA workers
              does not fall within the typical Peak Period of most of us working
              elsewhere. </p>
              <p>So it's super common to see packed Sv 53 buses to &amp; from CGA
              from 8pm onwards..and this happens typically everyday, including
              weekends.<br> And this 8pm-12am block is also the period in which you'll see the
              15-20mins waiting time start to appear (the same 20mins wait she
              mentioned in the article), because quite a few of the S-Shifters go
              off-service after 8pm, and IIRC, the BSEP ones also.</p>
              <p>AM Peak isn't that bad though. </p>

              <p>This happens to 27/34/858 too...</p>
              <p>So something we can all take is, this type of long hybrid routes like 53 isnt gonna work anymore... Its just gonna cause those at the end of the svc to suffer...</p>
              <p>I guess thats what they all say...</p>

              <p>I think it is justifiable that Svc 34 is stuck along Ave 7 traffic. So yeah, I can say the reliable service is 27..</p>
              <p>As for 53... I think it is also due to traffic congestion.. If let's say all buses are out already towards Changi Airport, there are some of the buses are travelling back to Bishan but got stuck at TPE exit (Loyang Ave/Tampines Ave 7 Exit) as such there is a delay..</p>
