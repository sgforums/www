              <p>Thats why I said... LTA still living in the 80s... And refusing to do something about their "Great Wall of China" routes... Just ytd i waited &gt;30 mins for two bus 5 to come at Simei Stn towards PSR... These routes are still not gonna work in the long term...</p>
              <p>So the best way is to address the routes themselves... By making sure that there isnt too much a reliance on too many sectors on one single route...</p>
              <p>In today's fast-paced society, it should no longer be a "one-service-fits-all" solution towards bus svc, but rather to seek for alternatives and attempt to use the element of CHOICE to displace the weight on heavily utilised train lines and long bus routes...</p>
              <p>P.s. 290A is not the faster version. It is introduced together with 290 and passes through heavily-disputed ç§€é † areas so that 290 can eventually become express, to shut the Sai Kung and KT council members up. </p>

              <p>I hear 53 is doing quite okay from a friend living in Pasir Ris.. Was out for drinks yesterday and mentioned to him coz he lives on the end of Pasir Ris Dr 1 towards Tampines side... And he takes sv 53 often to Pasir Ris Central or Loyang Ave though not to CGA..</p>
              <p>Here is what he said:</p>
              <p>-- It takes around 8 mins to Pasir Ris Central, and around 18-20 mins to Loyang Ave... so was saying he thinks you would be at CGA in 30 mins (during peak). </p>
              <p>-- He said it is irritating bcoz there are many stops, but not that it takes 40 mins to cross entire Pasir Ris. </p>
              <p>-- Frequency he said is quite okay though he does admit sometimes it takes 14-15 mins for bus to come, but he has not faced an issue with boarding even when bus is late, but says it is maybe coz it is first stop along dr 1. </p>

                          lives on the end of Pasir Ris Dr 1 towards Tampines side... And he
                          takes sv 53 often to Pasir Ris Central or Loyang Ave though not to
                          CGA..</p>
              <p>Here is what he said:</p>
              <p>-- It takes around 8 mins to Pasir Ris Central, and around 18-20
                          mins to Loyang Ave... so was saying he thinks you would be at CGA
                          in 30 mins (during peak). </p>
              <p>-- He said it is irritating bcoz there are many stops, but not
                          that it takes 40 mins to cross entire Pasir Ris. </p>
              <p>-- Frequency he said is quite okay though he does admit
                          sometimes it takes 14-15 mins for bus to come, but he has not faced
                          an issue with boarding even when bus is late, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but says it is maybe
                          coz it is first stop along dr 1. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Although admittedly, 40mins is indeed an exaggeration to cross the entire PSR Dr 1 stretch. But 20-30mins to cross the entire PSR Dr 1 is definitely quite a common thing, esp during Peak Hours (I experienced that before, multiple times). </p>
              <p>Anyway my point is to be more rational and consider the perspectives of different people staying at different stops along the stretch of PSR Dr 1. I wouldn't even say that my views are the same as those who stay in the later part of Dr 1 towards PSR Dr 12. </p>

              <p>And above all, it only makes sense for it to be there to be 18-20 mins away from Loyang (whether is true anot is open to debate)</p>

              <p>Your full explanation here does not stand true because you are assuming the end to be from Loyang Ave. Sorry my mistake as Tampines end can be assumed to be both Tampines Ave 7 and Tampines Ave 10... I meant the latter... But from my explanation shouldn't you already guess that he is saying 18-20 mins to cross all of Pasir Ris Dr 1 to Loyang Ave. Hence, he finds seats and standing space even though there are no downroutes from this end. </p>
