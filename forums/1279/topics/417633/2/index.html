              <p>Seriously what's good abt communism?</p>
              <p>The society ends up no productivity (all being equal), efficiency or rather the spur to improve.</p>
              <p>Well you can say they're doing well, but there's totally no freedom, no criticism of the state, nothing.</p>

              <p><br>There's no state ever called RPC.</p>
              <p>If no one criticises or suggest anything, there's no improvement to things. In fact, I've no idea how would Nobel peace prize could end up wallopped into politics by China.</p>
              <p>Maybe let me put it, the Korean issue. Of course China will want to look good, '6 party talks' because any war or whatever occurs, there would be refugees running into China. That's not wat they want.</p>
              <p>To me now the 6 party talks is just nothing but PR for cardboard.</p>
              <p>There's nothing abt big or small country. It's how it's managed, enforced and how the power chain of command is passed.</p>

              <p>Ah. One more thing. A bus - stop at the bus stop. The next bus (same service) rushed to the next stop via the current bus. Sometimes the Bus Captain may get angry and tried to drive after it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually from my experience, if an bus is overcrowded, the bus driver would not stop even if the the bus should stop at the next bus stop. And you think that the china man who laugh at the passenger is rude ? Nowadays Singaporean is even worst than him.For example in an foodcourt, I have seem an injured guy with a crutch holding his drink asking if he can join to empty seat for his drink, although there are at least 3 empty seat, the occuiped people who had taken the table for their lunch just said the table is being "taken" and the poor guy with the crutch just walked away with his injured leg.And worst I even seem an coffee-girl laugh at him for walking funny with his injuried leg and his drink 's cup pouring out a little which he is holding together with his crutch, seriously you think missing an bus case is more worst than the incident above ?
