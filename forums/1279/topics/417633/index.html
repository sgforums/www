              <p><br>actually tis matter have knew long ago</p>
              <p>it isn't just driving buses, lots of industries are surfacing tis.</p>
              <p>long working hours, cost of living is much higher than wat they experience in the suburban areas, etc.</p>
              <p>problem is diff from M'sian, as they've knew abt e env and cost of living since young.</p>

              <p>aiya...let him have a good laugh la.....aren't Sg quietly laughing at people in their hearts but hypocritically doesnt admit it?...at least he is outward about it....he should have restrained laughter than make it known so loud....LOL</p>
              <p>some other examples of sg quoting others being rude in jobs are the classic security industry....security guards trying to check visitors from entering estates have often been complained that they r rude..no doubt they r doing the right thing...these visitors can post educated reasonings and theories telling the world how the security guards should be improved just because of their frustration and inconvenience of being checked at the entry points...."last time dun follow law kena scolding...now follow law oso kena scolding"</p>
              <p>life life life...what can i say ay ay ay ay.....</p>

              <p>Agreed with this statement. Saw this a lot of times already, if happened to meet those kind SL, those selfish people will happen to board the bus &amp; let them press bell/ for last minute. If bad SL, too bad, they have to wait next bus. Imagine when they don't want to raise hands for 926, 963R, god luck for them as interval keep 20 to 30 mins.</p>

              <p>A polite message to all Chinamen who wants to continue to be assholes in our countries:</p>
              <p>Go back to your communist dictatorship and suck their asses.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>The rest of Singapore.</p>
              <p>To clarify:</p>
              <p>I don't mean all China nationals here, just the ones that are assholes. I have met some Chinese nationals who are actually quite great people; there was once a bus driver with Woodlands Transport, who regularly drives the Sembawang Shopping Centre shuttle bus, and he was extremely polite and friendly. The lady delivering Yakult in my area is also from China, and she's also one extremely polite and friendly madame.</p>
              <p>It's just these kind of assholes, the idiots, the snobs, the criminals, the murderers, that we need to weed out. How did they even get to set foot on other countries in the first- wait, I know: corrupt Chinese Communist government.</p>

              <p><br>u dun understand how could they make profits.. it's all because of efficiency.</p>
              <p>more for SMRT, they're not saddled w/ MRT cost at all! If SMRT is made into a BOT, dun think they would be posting profit until at least 2015.</p>
