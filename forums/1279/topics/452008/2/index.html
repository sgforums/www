              <p>I don't think the point is about paying, people are stranded at train stations and it is important that the crowds are dispersed as soon as possible safely. Both are public transport operators and they share the some responsiblity to a certain extent to help out. This is evident in the current approach in case of breakdowns.</p>
              <p>However having said that, if i was SBST, i would also have declined to help even if the company wanted to. Firstly, there's limited staff and of those available, none of the BC have been trained the route to travel beforehand, and neither have they been told their responsibilities. It's of the company's best interest to not do something risky like this but instead to strengthen the remaining routes that ply near MRT stations.</p>
              <p>The issue lies very much with how the public transport regulators have failed to mandate any contingency plans to cope with such situations until the Dec breakdowns. LTA and PTC very well knows SMRT does not have enough buses to cope with any large scale breakdowns, yet they did not bother with the issue and assumed the worst wont happen.</p>
              <p>LTA and PTC are the only govening bodies that can ensure both companies are cross-trained to cope with such situations, and also to ensure communication between both companies in times of need. They have however failed to do so in the dec breakdowns. Of course, if sbst have to be roped in to help, it is natural that they are compensated for use of their buses, but their bc and staff must be trained first.</p>

              <p>Clear cut their train breakdown big time.They still need to run bus ops my dear friend.The only option is to rent several private bus companies for their buses at a discount rate.Im pretty sure the private bus driver knowledge of routes is much better than SMRT SLs .Thats the option if SBST won't help them,You think if SBST help no need pay meh??</p>

              <p>yup. no precedence. and not willing to set a precedence. that's why LTA recently set one for both PTOs to follow.</p>

              <p>However having said that, if i was SBST, i would also have
              declined to help even if the company wanted to. Firstly, there's
              limited staff and of those available, none of the BC have been
              trained the route to travel beforehand, and neither have they been
              told their responsibilities. It's of the company's best interest to
              not do something risky like this but instead to strengthen the
              remaining routes that ply near MRT stations.</p>
              <p>The issue lies very much with how the public transport
              regulators have failed to mandate any contingency plans to cope
              with such situations until the Dec breakdowns. LTA and PTC very
              well knows SMRT does not have enough buses to cope with any large
              scale breakdowns, yet they did not bother with the issue and
              assumed the worst wont happen.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yup that's why I feel that the most ideal situation is for the regulating bodies to ensure this kind of co-ordination between the two bus companies.</p>
              <p>However I still feel SBST should render whatever help and resources possible in such situations. There may be stranded commuters who may not be clear of which bus routes lead to their destination and such.. I feel that bus bridging services should still be placed as the higher priority in such emergencies. In a way, they get to their destination from station to station faster too since, unlike regular bus services, they skip bus stops. This can save these commuters from further delaying their travelling journey.</p>
              <p>Of course, the down side is the BCs aren't trained and may not know the best routes to take. This is when I feel that since SMRT had asked SBST for help, they should also provide them a laydown on how the bus bridging services is being done, from pick up point to the routes and so on.</p>
              <p>In the future, the situation should be furthered improved when the regulating bodies step in and take some measures in ensuring the co-ordination of the two transport companies in the case of such emergencies.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents' worth</p>

              It is not like SBST isn't doing anything right? They try to redeploy double deckers for bus routes along the affected area and probably more frequent buses for some services. And like one member mentioned, SBST did deploy some buses for the bridging services. 
              SBST has even more problems to solve, they are still recruiting BCs because they do not have enough manpower to cater for even the needs of the basic services.
              And planning bridging services is not so easy. SBST is not the operator of the line, they will not be the first to know of such incidents. By the time they know, they need to plan the manpower to come, plan the timings and routes for the bridging services and what buses they can use for the bridging services. By the time all the BCs are recalled, buses drove to the scene, it is already hours passed. You think there are still people waiting for the bridging services? Most of them would already use the reguler bus routes or other means of transport to disperse.
              
              It still boils down to SMRT because they do not have a standard SOP for such major incidents. They fail to work with LTA and SBST to come up with a standard efficient procedure in times of crisis like this because they are so arrogant and irresponsible and too complacent, to think that such thing will never happen in their rail operations.
              
              I think it is time that LTA and the govt to reflect their thinkings on the public transport network. Rail should NOT be the backbone of the system but a comprehensive bus network throughout the island should be the backbone of Singapore public transport system. In case of such major incident again, bus routes and the whole bus system will still operate as usual to ferry millions to their destination even if the rail line doesn't work for hours or even days. They should encourage faster bus strips by building guided bus systems seperated aay from road traffic for major roads instead of wasting money building inefficient, land wasting LRT systems. So much money being wasted building the LRT system, which in the end, buses proved more realiable. Over reliance of an inflexible system will result in more problems instead.
              We pay millions to these ministers yet giving more problems instead.

              Although SMRT's incompetency is still to blame, but it is still not fully their fault. 
              I still disagree that LTA should use the rail system as a backbone for the public transport system. Buses should since they are more flexible and can still run at regular intervals even if a bus broke down or met an accident.
