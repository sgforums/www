              So you expect people to help when the whole place is not managed properly?
              
              SBS has it's own QoS to settle.

              <p>In the article, the OCC personnel mentioned 5 difficulties they faced, of which include:<br><br>1. Some MRT shuttles were caught in traffic jams and were unable to arrive on time at the affected MRT stretch.</p>
              <p>2. SMRT Buses has over 2000 service leaders and not all of them are familiar with the MRT shuttle routes.</p>
              <p>3. Limited personnel to guide MRT shuttle drivers.</p>
              <p>4. SBS Transit declined to render help.</p>
              <p>5. SMRT Buses only operates 25% of the bus routes in Singapore and thus unable to deploy enough buses for MRT shuttle.</p>
              <p>Reading through the above points, it makes me wonder that if SMRT SLs are not familiar with the routes, what difference would it make if SBST steps in other than being able to pump in some buses? The situation would still be equally chaotic with SBST BCs awaiting instructions from SMRT side.</p>

              <p>What I feel is that as long as the SBST BCs know which stations are closed, they can simply run the routes on their own. They only take instructions from the people on the ground when to depart from the affected mrt station.</p>
              <p>And by fact - SBST drivers are more familiar on the roads than SMRT drivers. partly cos of the coverage of the routes of SBST services except the north, as well as coverage of SMRT routes in certain parts of the island where its mostly SBST.</p>
              <p>its down to market share la. You cant possibly imagine SBST being unable to handle an MRT breakdown cos most drivers keep getting lost and yet controls 75% of the scheduled bus routes here.</p>

              Funny, SBST also needs to run its bus services as well. 
              
              You screw up your own work and you expect other people to clear up your own mess while they have even more work to do?
              SMRT sounds like a crybaby, such a shame. 
              Be glad that SBST still runs its frequent bus services along your screwed MRT line while your train breaks down.

              I guess memories of the SBS peak hr scene in the pre-MRT era is fading away.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually calling SBST to help SMRT will only result in more bus jams outside affected MRT stations. As you know, <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>SBST currently only operates NEL, which service 80 plys past most of the stations. SBST's BCs are only trained to operate NEL Shuttle and perhaps DTL Shuttle soon. Since it happened in peak hours also, SBST also having it's own bus services to operate, it is obvious for SBST to decline help. Because SBST drivers will also got caught in the maze especially on the AMK to TPY MRT station stretch. Got 1 driver on regular service already got lost while trying to nagivate through Bukit Timah Road. Now, imagine it on NSL. It will only make it more worse since there is also bendies doing the shuttle. You can imagine all the buses blocking the way to enter Braddel MRT Station.</p></div>
