              <p>I want to clarify something about service 242 (1989-current).</p>
              <p>In the start the second service 24l2 was introduced between Boon Lay Way (Lakeside MRT) to Jurong West St 91. <strong>Note: Service 242 had been calling at Jurong West St 72 &amp; Jurong West Ave 5 since that time.</strong></p>
              <p>I believe everyone should know 242 is amended to Boon Lay Interchange when it opened. <strong>The second point that everyone should know, is that there are two amendments for 242 in the Jurong West Neighbourhoods in the 90s.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The first amendment, is when 243 is introduced in 1991, service 242 was amended to skip Jurong West St 72 &amp; Jurong West Ave 5 and ply Upp Jurong Rd (the current Jurong West Ave 4).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The second amendment is in 1994, when 243 was amended to ply Jurong West St 81 &amp; 75 instead. Service 242 was amended back to ply Jurong West St 72 &amp; Jurong West Ave 5 (This amendment is not in June 1992!)</strong></p>
              <p>The other amendments everyone knows about it, so I'm not continuing from here.</p>

              <p><br>1) Services 192 &amp; 193 uses the OF1413s/ 1417s and then MB O405 NACs later.. Sv 193 was FAC in 1995 and reverted back to PAC in 1998 when 193 was amended to Tuas Ter. Both services received their LO2x in 1999 followed by the replacement to VO2x in 2003.<br><br>2) Service 27 was under BNDEP and Scania N113CRBs were used.<br><br>3) Somewhere around 1985-1986. Bedok to Ghim Moh route used to have DDs. If you are referring to the current era, Sv 13 gets DDs in July 2007.</p>
