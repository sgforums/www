              <p><br>Ya, that was one of the more serious accident during the chain of accidents involving SBS buses in the 1990s. Then SBS was so concerned about this chain of accidents that they called engineers from Mercedes Benz, Volvo and Scania to have a thorough checks on all their buses and install more safety features as well to enhance the safety standards of these buses.</p>

              <p><br>Personally I'm not into the Tridents.</p>
              <p>The suspension is too soft, the aircon is barely there and in general the mainteinance is found wanting.</p>
              <p>The way many Trident BCs drive is testimony to how little confidence they have in this bus. 2/3 of the rides will involve the BC lifting their foots on the pedal intermittently as they move. Its likely due to the combination of the Trident bouncing and its pretty neat acceleration that's causing this.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You ask me to recommend Trident rides, and I would say sv89 is more likely to give you a decent ride although there's no guarantee of that.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Speak of nostalgia, I also missed the flaps that could beÂ closed in many SBST bus AC outlets (the circular ones).</p>
              <p>The one where you twist the knob in the centre and the flaps close.</p>
              <p>Works the same way as the MKIV squarish types, which I like also.</p>
