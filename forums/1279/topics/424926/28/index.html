              <p>I believe the first 242 here had been withdrawn by this point of time, because before the bus interchange is closed, there's already a second 242 introduced from Lakeside MRT and loop at Jurong West St 91.</p>
              <p>And I would like to ask, did service 10 ever terminate at Boon Lay before?</p>

              <p>At Jurong Bus Interchange, during its 12 years of operation, its
              concourse was upgraded in 1987, with a canteen located upstairs and
              opened to the general public. A self-refilling point was also
              installed at Jurong Bus Interchange.<br> <br> Service 192 was introduced from Jurong Interchange to South Canal
              terminal but was subsequently withdrawn.<br> <br> In Jan 1988, there were feedbacks about the Jurong Bus Interchange
              that is located out of the way, when Boon Lay / Jurong West housing
              estates were partially developed and furthermore, there would be an
              MRT station constructed nearby (which is the present Boon Lay MRT
              Station). The feedbacks draws out positively and proves to be true
              and Jurong Bus Interchange would move out on 30th June 1990.<br> <br> With the Jurong West New Town development was ongoing, those
              relying on feeders will have to travel all the way down to Jurong
              Bus Interchange to transfer to other bus service or utilise the
              nearest bus stops for a faster destination. A feasible &amp;
              convenient bus interchange is called on, during its development

              <p>Thanks, but my main point is that those amendments and changes to Boon Lay Bus Services (mainly feeders and services that served the industrial area like 79, 192, 193, etc.) was very confusing in the 1990s and 2000s. The services has major route changes which I couldn't find anywhere, that's why I need someone's help to find out the routes of the continuously amended services.</p>

              <p>I believe 154 is amended to Eunos either before or on the day it was amended to Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>And did anyone know how did 192 and 193 get their routes today?</p>
