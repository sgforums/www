              <p>I apologise in the first place, but do you even read my quote properly? I was referring to whether the OF1417s was loaned to SS1 or SS7, since the one who replies is saying 1990s, by then SS1 is no longer existent.</p>

              <p>SS1 was merely a service from YCK MRT to Yishun. I remember Khatib and Yishun MRT were opened in late 1988.</p>
              <p>Believe SS1 was withdrawn somewhere around that time.</p>

              <p>1. Heh heh heh. There are no buses registered with such regos at all.</p>
              <p>2. This service uses your own buses, not SBS buses.</p>
              <p>3. I think you are referring to London service 450. Yes.</p>

              I wanted to clarify:
              
              1) When did service 385 converted from NAC status to PAC status?
              
              2) What are the other buses, are not reflected there that are registered before CSS177P?
              
              3) 402 i forgot to mention Stamford Road to Race Course Road, which buses did they use?
              
              4) Which buses did they use for 3 and 168 before converting it to fully air-con?
              
              5) I want to clarify the conversion list from STC to SBS. Which are the regos for 1xxx, 2xxx, 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx and 6xxx, if it is pre-SBS era?

              Ford R226 did on 172 and 175 before it converted to Volvo B57 and Mercedes-Benz O405.
              
              Did 172 and/or 175 uses Leyland Olympian 2-Axles too?

              <p><br>172 &amp; 175 have no DDs at all. This is because their roads in the rural areas of Choa Chu Kang &amp; Jurong are very narrow &amp; cannot accommodate double decker buses. Also, some trees along these areas does not have any height clearence for double deckers too.<br><br>For 172, even though they widened Choa Chu Kang Rd a little, it still cannot deploy DDs due to the TAB nearby.</p>

              <p><br>1) 385 was converted to PAC in 1999, when a few of their Mk2 perms were converted to CAC.<br><br>2) Bedford SB &amp; MB O309 minibuses. CSS1L to CSS177P were 1st Gen CSS buses and the regos are assigned differently under 2 CSS bus companies, NTUC Comfort &amp; SSB.<br><br>3) Albion Viking<br><br>4) Service 3 uses CRBs, UDs, Renault (SBS30P), Re-bodied CAC Leyland Victory buses.<br><br>Service 168 uses the MB O303s from former SABS. 8 buses were deployed (SBS1Z to SBS8E)<br><br>5) 6XXX are mostly from STC areas.

              <p>I remember Leyland Olympian 3-axles, Volvo Olympian 2-axles
              &amp; Volvo Olympian 3-axles perming 190 at some point of time.
              Later O405s and MK3s joined in. When is it?</p>
              <p>By the way can you answer the rest of the questions if you know
              anything?</p>
