              Before 359 was merged, 351 and 355 were shorter feeder services which their individual demands didn't require double deckers. When 359 was merged, demand picked up due to the connected links between different parts of Pasir Ris, then 359 warranted the use of double deckers.

              <p><br>TIB665P had been with 160/980 since new in Feb 1996 regardless of AMDEP or WLDEP controlling it. Started off with perm AMDEP 160 followed on to 980. After which transferred to WLDEP and became perm 167 for some time. Returned to perm 980 again under WLDEP in Jan 2001 due to duty transfers. Note that TIB665P was not affected despte duty transfers between AMDEP and WLDEP.</p>
              <p>TIB666L ever did perm AMDEP 980 before in 1999 and it also transferred to WLDEP 167. Back to perm 980 again under WLDEP in Jan 2001 till Sept 2004, after which it became perm 963 followed by 178. Returned to perm WLDEP 980 again last Nov.</p>

              <p>I remember service 87 when newly introduced in 1999 was also a PAC service, not sure which NAC buses did 87 then. Similar to service 88, it was also converted to FAC within 1-2 months.</p>
              <p>Think the 2002 bus guide also indicated as PAC for Sengkang feeders 371 and 372. Not sure whether the info is accurate or not.</p>
              <p>In 2005-2006, NAC MK2s made a sudden appearance on service 82, and it was rather unusual to have NAC buses passing thru Sengkang and Punggol estates then.</p>
