              MK2 CACs did 172 before. I took one before. 
              It was of the Alexander PS body type but didn't remember the rego.
              Most likely a cameo.

              <p>I want to point out something about the history of Dec 1990 bus rationalisation.</p>
              <p>Someone might be confused about 13's history, when it become a Eunos - Yio Chu Kang service from a Bedok - Ghim Moh service. However, I shall make it clear.</p>
              <p>13 was first shortened to Eunos (not sure when is it), making it Eunos - Ghim Moh service. In Dec 1990, it was then shortened to Yio Chu Kang from Ghim Moh. On the same day it was made FAC.</p>
              <p>On the same day, 20, which also plied between Bedok and Ghim Moh, was withdrawn. With the withdrawal of service 20, service 100 and 111 were amended to Ghim Moh from WTC and Buona Vista respectively.</p>
              <p>With the amendment of service 111, service 191, which plied between Ghim Moh and Portsdown Rd, was amended to Buona Vista Terminal.</p>

              <p>So that means the three WLDEP Striders perms were indeed replaced by the U31RCNs when 160 was re-numbered to 980.</p>

              <p>Can say so. In fact these 3 UDs already started doing 160 just 1-2 weeks before it got renumbered to 980.</p>
              <p>Good riddance to the 3 UDs when 980 came under full AMDEP and started getting Lances in Jul 1999.</p>
