              <p>I remember service 87 when newly introduced in 1999 was also a PAC service, not sure which NAC buses did 87 then. Similar to service 88, it was also converted to FAC within 1-2 months.</p>
              <p>Think the 2002 bus guide also indicated as PAC for Sengkang feeders 371 and 372. Not sure whether the info is accurate or not.</p>
              <p>In 2005-2006, NAC MK2s made a sudden appearance on service 82, and it was rather unusual to have NAC buses passing thru Sengkang and Punggol estates then.</p>

              <p><br>Townlink 265 is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></strong> the merger of Feeder 265 and Feeder 266. 265 is just extended to Ang Mo Kio Depot and becoming a Townlink service because it plied two ways between Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange. Feeder 266 was withdrawn itself.</p>
              <p>Feeder 269 was amended to ply Ang Mo Kio Ave 4 instead of Ave 6 to cover up the withdrawn sectors of Feeder 266 with the deleted sectors replaced by service 138. Note that 269 did not ply Yio Chu Kang Rd back then. Only then in late 2002 was 269 extended further to ply Yio Chu Kang Rd and Ang Mo Kio Ave 5.</p>
