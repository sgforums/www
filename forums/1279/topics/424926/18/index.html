              <p>&gt; Kallang Gasworks (Junction of Kallang Rd/Crawford Street..) In the late 80s/early 90s, part of Crawford Street was closed due to something, therefore buses were diverted to a certain road before continuing their journey to Crawford St and so on. Was the road called 'Kg Bugis'? And why was Crawford Street closed?</p>

              <p>852 was under KJDEP control (regardless of full or partial) ever since it was introduced till June 2000 when it became full AMDEP. Went back to be KJDEP controlled in Jan 2001, this last for 3 years till Jan 2004, and this is the last time 852 was KJDEP control.</p>
              <p>855 was also under KJDEP control, I'm not sure what time is it, but the thing I know is that 855 was no longer under KJDEP control sometime before it was made AMDEP/WLDEP controlled in 1998 (or maybe 855 was redeployed from KJDEP to WLDEP that time) then in Jul 1999 become full AMDEP controlled.</p>

                  Went back to be KJDEP controlled in Jan 2001, this last for 3 years
                  till Jan 2004, and this is the last time 852 was KJDEP control.</p>
              <p>855 was also under KJDEP control, I'm not sure
                  what time is it, but the thing I know is that 855 was no
                  longer under KJDEP control sometime before it was made AMDEP/WLDEP
                  controlled in 1998 (or maybe 855 was redeployed from KJDEP to WLDEP
                  that time) then in Jul 1999 become full AMDEP controlled.</p>

              <p>852 was all the while full KJDEP whereas 855 was minority KJDEP.</p>
              <p>All these depot operations changed when WLDEP opened in late 1998, 852 became KJDEP/WLDEP whereas 855 became AMDEP/WLDEP.</p>
              <p>Another major depot shift took place again in 1999 due to SBS/Tibs swop. 855 became full AMDEP, whereas 852 came under partial AMDEP for the first time (KJDEP continue to control the other half). Eventually 852 became full AMDEP when Tibs began to take over Bt Batok services.</p>
