              I need to answer the questions since it goes unanswered for 16 days.
              
              1. Did LA perm on 2, 7, 10, 14, 22, 23, 25, 30, 33, 51, 61, 63, 65, 106, 111, 166, 169, 178, 189 and 190? If so what are the regos you might probably see?
              
              2. Did O305 perm on 81, 97, 111 and any other service. If so what are the regos you might probably see?
              
              3. When is service 174 in Bukit Batok Depot before 1988, if terminate at NTU?
              
              4. Where is the service 175 depots and fleet were, throughout the years?
              
              5. Where is the service 188 depots and fleet were, throughout the years?
              
              6. Where is the service 169 and 178 fleet were, throughout the years?

              <p>If you realised closely as to why Service 192 &amp; 193 were amended to cover Jurong West St 64 &amp; Jurong West Ave 4 is because it provides more coverage for residents living in Jurong West who wants to head to the Jurong /Tuas Industrial Estate.<br><br>Also, not just the above reason alone, but the cut off of part of the sector of Upp Jurong Rd. Part of Jurong West Ave 2 &amp; 4 is part of former Upp Jurong Rd.<br><br>The current Jurong West Ave 2 is also part of the ending sector of PIE (34km mark), and thereafter it leads to Upp Jurong Rd (the current Jurong West Ave 2 &amp; 4 and the junction of Corporation Rd)</p>

              <p>Basically PIE ended at JJC junction... I think the actual Upp Jurong Rd/ Jurong Rd divider should be Jln Bahar/ Jln Boon Lay junction.</p>
              <p>Which is why Jurong West Ave 4 the roads are 3 lane per direction and w/ semi expressway speed limit.</p>

              <p>According to the SBS Busway newsletter (There was a section in the newsletter with route amendments/withdrawal/introduction details), 242 was withdrawn on March 1990 due to route duplication with services like 187, 199 and 240 etc.<br><br>However on the April 1990 and May 1990 editon of the newsletter there was no mention on new service 242 being introduced as a service between Lakeside MRT and Jurong West Street 91. But then on the Jun/July 1990 joint edition of the newsletter when there was a feature of the new Boon Lay Interchange it mentioned that 242 was 'moved' to the new interchange instead of 'introduced as a new service'.</p>

              <p>If I'm not wrong, service 50 terminated at the new (and current) Eunos Bus Interchange just before its withdrawal. Before it used the new DM MK2s, it has a fleet of Mercedes-Benz OF1413 and Mercedes-Benz OF1417.</p>
