              <p>I need some ans..</p>
              <p>1- When did Bedok Int start operation ? Is it 1977,78 or 79?</p>
              <p>2- A lot of posts state that svc 225 has never been amended. But I heard when it first came abt, the route/bus stops were slightly different. Any Bus Guides to confirm?</p>
              <p>3-Any info regarding Special svc 777 (was it 767 or 757) somewhere in 1988-90 Singapore Airshow? Plied Xilin Ave, Changi Coast Rd..</p>

              <p>Just sharing some info regarding my previous curiosities etc regarding Bedok bus services in the past...</p>
              <p>2-Answering my own qn.- SVC 225 was a one direction only svc (existing White plate route) when 1st introduced. (from BG79-80). Was made to ply 2 directions (White-Green plate) later (from BG80-81). No change of route till present.</p>
              <p>**SVC 33 was the bus that plied Chai Chee St/Dr in the opposite direction of<br>existing SVC 222 (from BG77). That shows why we can see signs of bustops there.<br>SVC 33 - Old Upp Changi Rd (Track 6) - Pasir Panjang Rd. Track 6 was somewhere <br>ard blks 41-44. (Old Upper Changi Rd was renamed Chai Chee St/Dr)</p>
              <p>**SVC 228 when 1st introduced was plying one direction : Bedok Int, BN Ave 1, BN Rd, Bdk Resvr Rd, BN Ave 3, BN St 1 &amp; Bedok Int. When SVC 226 was introduced, SVC 228 changed route to the other direction : Bedok Int, BN St 1, BN Ave 3, Bdk Resvr Rd, BN Rd, BN Ave 1 &amp; Bedok Int. (from BG82)</p>
              <p>SVC 228 was later extended to Bdk Resvr Rd Loop (From BG85).</p>
              <p>Somewhere in late 80s I tink, SVC 226 &amp; 228 was slighlty amended when Bedok Resvr Rd Loop was changed to a one-way road.<br>SVC 228 - No change of route till present.<br>SVC 226 was integrated with SVC 385 to form SVC 60 somewhere during late 90s?</p>

              <p>2-Answering my own qn.- SVC 225 was a one direction only svc
              (existing White plate route) when 1st introduced. (from BG79-80).
              Was made to ply 2 directions (White-Green plate) later (from
              BG80-81). No change of route till present.</p>
              <p>**SVC 33 was the bus that plied Chai Chee St/Dr in the opposite
              direction of<br> existing SVC 222 (from BG77). That shows why we can see signs of
              bustops there.<br> SVC 33 - Old Upp Changi Rd (Track 6) - Pasir Panjang Rd. Track 6
              was somewhere<br> ard blks 41-44. (Old Upper Changi Rd was renamed Chai Chee
              St/Dr)</p>
              <p>**SVC 228 when 1st introduced was plying one direction : Bedok
              Int, BN Ave 1, BN Rd, Bdk Resvr Rd, BN Ave 3, BN St 1 &amp; Bedok
              Int. When SVC 226 was introduced, SVC 228 changed route to the
              other direction : Bedok Int, BN St 1, BN Ave 3, Bdk Resvr Rd, BN
              Rd, BN Ave 1 &amp; Bedok Int. (from BG82)</p>
              <p>SVC 228 was later extended to Bdk Resvr Rd Loop (From BG85).</p>
              <p>Somewhere in late 80s I tink, SVC 226 &amp; 228 was slighlty
              amended when Bedok Resvr Rd Loop was changed to a one-way
              road.<br> SVC 228 - No change of route till present.<br> SVC 226 was integrated with SVC 385 to form SVC 60 somewhere during
              late 90s?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Feeder 226 was merged with Feeder 385 in 2002.</p>
              <p>By the way I remembered DDs doing 385 before. Can anyone confirm?</p>

              <p>Feeder 323 still plies Hougang Ave 7 &amp; 5 after merger with Feeder 329. It was only in June 1992 that it was amended to use Tampines Rd. </p>

              <p>Even if 61 and 173 were made WLDEP controlled earlier, they will still be redeployed back to KJDEP in 2008. So what's the purpose of redeploying them to WLDEP?</p>

              Other than bus rego info:
              1) Service 540 is former Svc 306 (Blue Arrow). Do you know when service 540 started operating to Hillview ?
              2) Did service 450 operates after 1990, to Pasir Laba Camp? Buses use include O405, Leyland Olympian, Enviro400, Dennis Trident 2/Plaxton President and Scania K230UB. Even before Leyland Olympian, MCW Metrobus were deployed.
              3) When did service 180, 194, 201, 204, 206, 208, 211, 212, 213, 216, 217, 230, 245 was withdrawn?
              4) Did you know what are the regos for STC, all those bus companies pre-1973 (incl. SH and SZ series)?
              5) When did service 197 and 198 receive changes?
              6) When did service 194 re-intro to Bird Park?
              7) On SGWiki, you only show histories post-1979? Can you lend the histories of pre-1979?
              Can you also show it on SGForums Buses, and start from 1900s?
              8) When did bus lanes were introduced in all other roads. I only find histories in -
              1974: Victoria Street, Hill Street, Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road, North Bridge Road, South Bridge Road, Orchard Road, Bras Basah Road, Stamford Road &amp; CBD
              1977-1978: Serangoon Road
              1985: Thomson Road, Upper Thomson Road
              1993: Jurong Town Hall Road
              can u find histories of how did started for bus lanes in Upper Bukit Timah Road, Changi Road-Geylang Road, Sims Avenue-Sims Avenue East, Jalan Eunos-Eunos Link-Hougang Avenue 3-Hougang Avenue 2-Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and Yishun Avenue 2?
              9) When did service 179 actually withdrawn and kena re-introduced?
              10) When did service 177 was actually refined to become Bukit Batok - Bukit Panjang service?
              11) When did service 101 (Serangoon Garden Circus - New Bridge Road) withdrawn. Is it due to the MRT rationalisation, or actually merged with service 103?
              12) Can you actually find former bus deployments of other bus models other than listed above?
              13) When did SBS bus actually started converting to OPO operation, first bus route?
              14) Service 39 is BNDEP. This bus route anyhow transfer to AMDEP. Should stay in BNDEP?
              15) Service 139 is AMDEP until 1999. Then comes to a 12-year hiatus. Should they stay in AMDEP for Double-Decker Buses?
              16) SBS &amp; Tibs Handover Exercises, are quite screwed. Shouldn't all services stay in SBS while Tibs can refine 864, 865 and 866 into specific services?
              17) When did service 97 actually started? in 1982 or 1983?
              18) When did service 74 actually get fully air-con buses?
              19) Which bus routes get fully air-con earlier than 1998?
