              <p>To answer this question over Sv merger and cancellation</p>
              <p>There was 2 main reason for rt merger and cancellation, in fact 3 even..</p>
              <p>1) CBD Rts: They wanted to reduce the no of buses inside the CBD and even the roadside terminals aft the MRT commenced.</p>
              <p>This clause saw Svs like 20 removed, M2 was introduced w/ the MRT &gt; feeder concept.</p>
              <p>2) Buses became bigger: Bigger buses meant more capacity, I guess some Svs were removed. Some examples was CSS 6 that duplicated with 65.</p>
              <p>3) MRT: Some long distance routes were simply shortened as there's no point in creating long dist rts... Sv 2 was shortened to just ply CBD - Changi Village instead of plying all the way to Buona Vista.</p>

              <p>Yes, it was used as a 1-year trial. His information were all false, like the years of introduction and de-registration, and also the models.</p>
              <p>In one of your posts you replied me, it says that SBS1518T-SBS1616T is the same model (Mercedes-Benz OF1417) but with two bodyworks overall. Only SBS1519R-SBS1524A were bodied by Soon Chow, the rest are all Hawke bodied.</p>

              Some questions of deployments and past history:
              
              (Second time, like Volvo Olympian 2-axles)
              QR-Code on today's news is meant to snap in Mega 13-15.
              
              1. What buses did bus route 450 use from 1978 to 1990?
              
              2. When did route 10 removed Leyland Atlantean (Alexander R)?
              
              3. What are the bus regos for Leyland Atlantean - Service 169 and 178 deployments?
              
              4. Sentosa i think got AEC Regent IV if i am not wrong. Guess is before 1991.
              
              5. Why did Sentosa Leyland Olympians were deployed on Green Route and not on the Red Route?
              
              6. Why did Sentosa never buy Ayats Bravo City in 2005?
              
              7. When does 173 withdrew part from Clementi to New Bridge Road?
              
              8. Did route 28 use LA in the past, and did route 30 use LA in the past?
              
              9. I thought Upper Thomson Road/Mandai Road is enclosed with Tibs boundary. Do you know why?
              
              10. When did route 171 had their origins from. I know 170 got origin from Green Bus Route.
              
              11. Can you tell me the history of buses in 2xxx - 2000 to 2356, 3xxx - 3000 to 3398, 4xxx - 4000 to 4687, 5xxx - 5009 to 5324 and 6xxx - 6000 to 6493 (when did it de-register and introduce service).
              
              12. Can you get histories in SGWiki - 1975 to 1978, 1984, 1987 to 1990, 1995, 1997 to 2002, and beyond 2005.
              
              13. When did Scheme B route 626 started operation and ended operation?
              
              14. Did service 640 use Dennis Trident 2 in 1999?
              
              15. Did service 647 and 656 use East Lancs Lolyne or Plaxton President in 1999? Even though got Volvo Olympians or MCW Metrobus it is still possible?

              <p>4. Sentosa i think got <span>AEC</span> Regent IV if i am not wrong. Guess is before 1991.</p>
              <p>5. Why did Sentosa Leyland Olympians were deployed on Green Route and not on the Red Route?</p>

              <p>7. When does 173 withdrew part from Clementi to New Bridge Road?</p>
              <p>8. Did route 28 use LA in the past, and did route 30 use LA in the past?</p>
              <p>9. I thought Upper Thomson Road/Mandai Road is enclosed with Tibs boundary. Do you know why?</p>
              <p>10. When did route 171 had their origins from. I know 170 got origin from Green Bus Route.</p>

              <p>12. Can you get histories in SGWiki – 1975 to 1978, 1984, 1987 to 1990, 1995, 1997 to 2002, and beyond 2005.</p>
