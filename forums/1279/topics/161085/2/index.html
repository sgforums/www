The real Sentosa B7RLE don't have a rear window.<br><br>It is probably an existing model in the manufacturer's lineup but painted in the colours of the Sentosa bus; just like what SBS did for their 25th Anniversary model. This is much more faster and cheaper than to produce a scaled down model of the real thing, whereby the manufacturer will have to design and make the mould for casting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just visited the jotus website. Interesting new way to buy models instead of physically flying there to buy !

Also this maker Creative Master Northcord, never heard of them before but how you find the model's quality ?? In terms of sharpness of edges, accuracy of details, paintwork finishing ? Also since it's die-cast (metal hence !) @ only 1:76 is the sharpness &amp; accuracy as good as on the high quality plastic models like Herpa of 1:87 scale ?<br><br>I also note they only make 1000 pieces this model. It seems the regular 3-door red colour version is more popular as the 2000+ pieces were all sold out !<br><br>Overall of that model website, i notice they cater mainly to RHD models used in Hong Kong &amp; England ?

            <div class='col-md body'>If you havent noticed,<br>Most of the buses produced by Corgi and Creative Master Northcord for the hong kong buses are based on this 1:76 scale.<br>I have never bought any plastic buses before, as i find the model too "unreal" due to the weight and paint. Quality is alright compared to Corgi models.<br><br>Also, the model may be sold out in jotus, but may still be avaliable elsewhere.<br><br>Also try http://www.80mbusmodel.com/<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hseochin:</div><div class="quote_body">I've just visited the jotus website.
