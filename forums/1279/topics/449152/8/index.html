              <p>Take the MRT on both EWL &amp; the Changi line, you'll
              definitely see it if you look in the direction of the Newater
              Visitor Centre.</p>
              <p>That Changi bus park is still not in operation as of today. No
              buses parked there. Only spotted a road-roller smooth-paving the
              new road leading to the bus park.</p>
              <p>On another note, think BNDEP is having a severe space crunch
              already? Their intake of Citaros lately has been more than their
              outgoing number of awaiting-de-reg Mk4s..resulting in the Citaros
              being parked everywhere. Sv3's parking lot is now mixed with the
              new SP &amp; BSEP Citaros &amp; the Sv3 permers at night. Then the
              area in front of the refuelling pumps, parking is now in the form
              of triple-stacking (three buses parked side-by-side, the one
              furthest from the outside road is the closest to the pump if anyone
              don't get what I mean), used to be at most double-stacking late at
              night.</p>

              <p>No buses spotted there yet as of today (31 Jan). One thing I noticed is that it seems to lack even a bus washer or something like that? I don't think it's obstructed (my view that is from the MRT) cause it's just one big plot of land with lots of tall lamp posts &amp; clearly-marked 12m bus lots). But yeah, it just seems like one big open-air carpark you would find in your typical HDB neighbourhood. No sign of any refuelling pumps too cause the newly-built slip road leads directly to the entrance of the new bus park, just straight in. </p>
              <p>Which implies possibly that the buses are gonna refuel &amp; wash everyday at BNDEP then BCs drive to that new bus park in Changi to park? I might be wrong though, but it seems so for now. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>

              <p>I don't think the new bus park in Changi has fuel and adblue pumps and bus washers, the new bus park besides WLDEP doesn't have them, just an office, thats all. ARBP and BRBP has a bus wash and fuel/adblue pumps AFAIK (self sustaining, no need to rely on parent depots except for major maintenance)</p>

              <p>They should have had fueling and washing services at the depot
              rather than toggle the buses between depots. So quickest route for
              bus from BNDEP would be to come out on Simei Ave and go left on
              Expo road. Actually, not too far, may be 1 -1.5 km</p>

              <p>People as in what type of people? <br><br>I don't think it would be like how BRBP is to AMDEP, or ARBP is to BBDEP for that matter. Like what 'carbikebus' mentioned, BR &amp; AR both have their own bus washers &amp; refuelling pumps. So they are sort of a semi-independent depot, just that their buses can be exchanged within AM &amp; BB respectively by the starters.</p>
              <p>I'm more inclined to think that this new Changi bus park is like an additional plot of land of BNDEP, like an extension of BNDEP, just that it's not located right beside BNDEP but 1km+ away. Something along that line. So I guess finding out which services park in Changi doesn't matter much, since they will still go to BN for maintenance &amp; refuel. Unless some services like Sv 16 or 48 gets minority control under BN when the bus park open.</p>

              <p>I think 48 may finally get some duties transferred to BNDEP after the Changi bus park opens. Think they wanted to switch initially when they made Sv48 terminate at BNDEP, but BNDEP already had a parking space crunch when Sv48 changed terminating points with the Mk4s still not going off &amp; mass-intake of Citaros &amp; Wrights. That's why that plan was shelved I believe.  Like I mentioned before, BNDEP even resorted to 3-wide parking beside the refuelling pumps nowadays, which is not alot of space to begin with so it speaks alot abt their tight space.</p>
              <p>Think 16 can actually remain full ARBP in my opinion. Sv 7 on the other hand, they had a reason why they made Sv 7 full BBDEP now when they were initially majority BBDEP but minority BNDEP control a few years ago. Think it has something to do with the off-service journey time to the depots from Bedok, I can't remember exactly why. </p>
              <p>I think the most likely candidates that get switched to Changi when it opens would be the services like Sv 36, the CGV services (Sv 2 &amp; 109), Serangoon, Yishun &amp; Punggol services (Sv 3, 39 &amp; 81) etc which are more easily accessible to reach their terminals by using the ECP then switch expressways, instead of going by Upp Changi Rd East or something. Almost certain Sv 36 would switch to Changi, cause Changi bus park is way closer to CGA than BNDEP is, plus that new bus park is much closer to the entrance of ECP to go to CGA.</p>
