              <p><br>As per my loading analysis, 61 has high loading only upto Ngee Ann from Bukit Batok which is 20% of its route. 61 loading drops significantly thereafter and has 166 in parallel from Alexandra road to City hall area. If you notice even 166 loading is not high in this part of its route, and 4 DD slots of 166 have been downgraded to SD over the last few months.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">LTA might help SMRT to rival sbst bus services. And you might see more DD buses on the road by smrt. if they get the tender for the up coming new hdb towns where some of them might not have driect MRT link or operated by SBST.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">One way is to provide semi-express service to city area. again smart plaining needed for those semi-express or express bus service.  </span></p>

              <p>My next batch of analysis.</p>
              <p><strong>sv 167 - 190</strong></p>
              <p>sv 167</p>
              <p>3 DDs, 19 SDs. AM peak DDs towards Bukit Merah, PM peak towards Sembawang. With further development around Sembawang Road and Upper Thomson, sv 167 is getting very crowded until it reaches Thomson Plaza area from where there are other services that share the load. SMRT will be able to get 80+ loading between Sembawang Road and Thomson Road.</p>
              <p>sv 169</p>
              <p>19 DDs, 2 SDs. Yes I am suggesting massive capacity upgrade for sv 169. Will be fully operated by WLDEP as AMDEP cannot accommodate DDs. 169 has a consistent high loading pattern. Very high loading from Woodlands to Admiralty, Seneko Industrial areas. From Sembawang Road to Yishun. From Yishun MRT to Upper Thomson. Also afternoons and PM peak huge loads from Republic Poly. The loading is also bi-directional justifying the high number of high capacity buses.</p>
              <p>sv 171</p>
              <p>No need for DD or articulated buses as current fleet is managing the loading well.</p>
              <p>sv 172</p>
              <p>8 DDs, 6 SDs. Long distance travellers and during peak hours loading exceeds 70 pax. Even if loading is around 60 pax almost 3/4th bus travels from Boon Lay right upto CCK. Hence, more high capacity buses makes complete sense.</p>
              <p>sv 173</p>
              <p>12 SDs. One bus added to improve frequency. No bendies or DDs required</p>
              <p>sv 176</p>
              <p>6 SDs, 20 Bendies. Capacity of articulated buses enhanced as now SMRT will have those buses to give to sv 176. 176 also sees one of the highest loading and is unique in many ways with very low duplication with other services. Hence, if someone misses the bus, they dont have an option but to wait for next 176. Also like 172, most people use this bus for traveling long distances.</p>
              <p>sv 178</p>
              <p>17 SDs. No need for DD or bendy as current fleet managing the loading well. Loading on most part of route between 50-55 pax.</p>
              <p>sv 180</p>
              <p>12 DDs. Full fleet DD. Again most people on this service travel long distance once they board the bus. Hence, DDs make sense with higher seating capacity.</p>
              <p>sv 184</p>
              <p>16 Bendies OR 16 DDs OR mix of DDs + bendies, but SMRT should take full advantage of its enhanced fleet and make 184 full high capacity. Consistent high loading in both directions and also will give good competition to SBST services 52, 154, 154B.</p>
              <p>sv 187</p>
              <p>12 DDs, 12 SDs. As you see the high capacity buses are increased by more than double given the high loading on this route. I have consistently seen people missing this bus because of high number of rigids that are not able to manage the loading. Also good competition to SBST sv 98 from Lakeside.</p>
              <p>sv 188</p>
              <p>16 DDs, 8 SDs. The 8 SDs will be mostly for the opposite side of peak hour rush. The peak hour direction will see consecutive deployment of DDs. Loading on this service is 100+ on certain sectors and 70+ very often.</p>
              <p>sv 190</p>
              <p>40 buses: 34 DDs, 6 SDs. Does anyone want to argue why 190 is getting 34 DDs!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              178 &amp; 187 sure tio Wldep &amp; Wedep..I think Amdep wait for LTA to built a bus park nearby...hehehe.Hougang by then sure have a sub bus park near Sengkang or Punggol if they get to control Bidadari side..Not being optimisitic here but just bus discussion.
              Ayer Rajah also need relocate as there is redevelopment at Ayer Rajah Cres in future.West Coast best place?Also when Tuas West MRT is up im sure the Terminal will be relocated or more svc will starts there.Joo Koon depend on how SBST wanna extend few of Boon Lay Svc there.Best also SBST take back Jurong Island svc and reroute and enhance some of the svc.If a new depot is built for Ayer Rajah then Bbdep can also control Jurong East svc.

              <p><br>The downgrade from SMRT side is more because they didnt have high capacity buses and had to give them to more needy services. sv 61 loading has dropped a lot over the years with more routes in parallel now. Hence, to me, full rigid on sv 61 is also good. Giving DDs should not be a priority until other major high loading service needs are fulfilled. Then SMRT can think about it, how SBST allocated to sv 125, 130 etc. once they had more than enough DDs.</p>
