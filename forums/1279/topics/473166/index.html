            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE â€“ SBS Transit on Tuesday reported second-quarter profit plunged 30.6 per cent from the corresponding period a year earlier, as the transport operator was hit by rising staff costs as well as higher repair and maintenance costsNet profit for the three months ended June 30 was S$31.6 million, down from S$4.55 million in the previous corresponding period, even as revenue rose 6.7 per cent to S$209.3 million mainly because of higher ridership on its buses and trains.Revenue from bus operations rose by 7 per cent to S$159.6 million due to the increase in average daily ridership of 3 per cent and an increase in other operating income, partly offset by the decrease in the average fare.Revenue from rail operations rose by 7.1 per cent to S$36.4 million, with an increase in ridership partly offset by the fall in the average fare. Average daily ridership for the North-East Line and the two Light Rail Transit systems went up by 5.9 and 9.8 per cent, respectively, from the previous corresponding period.SBS Transit declared an interim cash dividend of 0.9 cent per share, down from 1.35 cents a year ago</div>

              <p>107 has very very low demand during off peak hours. But the peak hour load also not very high, just average. Maybe if a DD come, the upper deck is hardly fully seated and lower deck maybe a few standees or fully seated. I think 107M should operate from hougang central interchange to geylang bahru (loop) and operate during off peak hours while 107 can operate during peak hours. Whats the use of 107M to suntec city tower two when there are no people taking it from there?? </p>
              <p>As for 75, also same thing as 107.</p>

              <p>The peak hour service should not only apply to the industrial
              services. It should be implemented on some of the current services
              too. Services like 75 and 107. </p>

              <p>might as well put all bus services on peak hour service instead? SBST will be happy cos they dun have to find more drivers to do am/pm shift and do not have use empty DDs during off peak hour...  SBST earning mostly came from peak hours loading only...</p>
              <p>you know what, there are some ppl who say that during off peak hour, demand are not there, so all DDs should be rest at depot and deploy only SDs during off peak.... i do not want to say who say that, but do you think it is logical at all? So SBST must buy more SD/DD? 1st trip 5am -off peak -use SD, then quickly off service back to Depot to change to DD and after am peak, go back to depot change back to SD to continue ply until pm peak, then go back to depot change DD again?  this is what some kids are thinking when they say that the DDs are empty/useless during off peak hours.</p>

              <p>should just remove Sv95 since it is useless... lol... anyway, speaking of sv95, was in NUH area on wed morning.. 9.45am saw at the bus stop outside NUH, full of paxs waiting for shuttle buses/sv95... the whole bus stop is full... two sv95 SDs came in 5 mins and still left behind so many ppl as the students keep coming out from the station.. no sign of NUS internal shuttle.. at 11am, also same situation... have to depend on sv95 to relief the load... so soonest or later, the student council will complain to SBST again....</p>

              <p>Ah the perennial problem of internal shuttles. This year they changed some routes and some of us got lost when we returned to study (myself included).</p>
              <p>And here we have people who say things like 95 has double-deck = useless since nobody goes to upper deck. etc etc</p>
              <p>I will have them know that people do move to the upper deck even for a few stops in the case of 95.</p>
              <p>As for the wider argument for the intra-town DDs, people do move to the upper deck as well. People who argue against the wisdom of DDs must be blind in other words.</p>
              <p>lol</p>
              <p>And there are people who also say, some routes can have bendies, some routes can have DDs, some routes can have SDs, so bendies still remain relevant here.</p>
              <p>Guess these are people who buy 7 side cai png with 3 strands of morsels for each side. lolol <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Its akin to those who argue that DDs are useless for off-peak hrs and the fleet should therefore be 160% with excess!</p>
