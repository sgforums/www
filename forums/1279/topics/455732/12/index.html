              <p>Bendy blocking bendy, which in turn was blocking the road. Why? Because of WRI SLs' habit of leaving the bus at the bay while reporting to the control station. It's a common scene across most interchanges, but particularly bad at WRI as practically EVERY SL does that. The result? This picture shows a bus held up by such an act, the SL who was blocked was furiously honking away as honks came from the buses behind that were blocked.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Think this is an isolated case of how troublesome bendies are? Think again. The flash of bus at the extreme right is from a bus that is inching its way past the bendies. Low lighting at night meant that any small movement = blur = appears fast. If anything, look at how the bendy that was blocking the way cooperated by parking as close as possible to the 1st bus, and how tight the space was left for the 3rd bus to pass.</p>

              <p>The SL hogging bus-bay problem had always been there since day 1. But the problem has gone out of control with the influx of bendies (1999 saw only box bendies) and the increased fleet size and crowds. Mind you, the last picture was taken at 9pm. There were plenty of bus-lots outside, but nobody wants to walk the 200m to and 200m fro to the main part of the interchange, hence all the haphazard parking.</p>

              <p>Bendy blocking bendy, which in turn was blocking the road. Why?
              Because of WRI SLs' habit of leaving the bus at the bay while
              reporting to the control station. It's a common scene across most
              interchanges, but particularly bad at WRI as practically EVERY SL
              does that. The result? This picture shows a bus held up by such an

              <p>If you delve deep into the inquiries and literature review, which I'm not sure you have full access to, then you'll see that the pattern of operation leading up to that accident followed pretty much the same moral path.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>Network Rail was to run into more problems such as its ambiguous position as public/private company....suggesting that the "third way" for public transport, between nationalisation and privatisation, might be less viable. Viabilitiy on the other hand, can be tweaked somewhat by having the proper institutions. That will take a bit of time.</p>
