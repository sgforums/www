              <p>Pictures of bendies  from me. And stories to tell from my
              visit to where I used to live at.</p>
              <p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e1pdHQHdKHA/UCEsfKJGYHI/AAAAAAAAAkY/ArympylY6e8/s1600/07082012149.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
              <p>Bendy blocking bendy, which in turn was blocking the road. Why?
              Because of WRI SLs' habit of leaving the bus at the bay while
              reporting to the control station. It's a common scene across most
              interchanges, but particularly bad at WRI as practically EVERY SL
              does that. The result? This picture shows a bus held up by such an
              act, the SL who was blocked was furiously honking away as honks
              came from the buses behind that were blocked.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AWw9do2jmFQ/UCEsgmAfIiI/AAAAAAAAAko/pc9Y6UZQw5Y/s1600/07082012153.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
              <p>Think this is an isolated case of how troublesome bendies are?
              Think again. The flash of bus at the extreme right is from a bus
              that is inching its way past the bendies. Low lighting at night
              meant that any small movement = blur = appears fast. If anything,
              look at how the bendy that was blocking the way cooperated by
              parking as close as possible to the 1st bus, and how tight the
              space was left for the 3rd bus to pass.</p>
              <p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IE2X5HHUbAU/UCEsgA21hNI/AAAAAAAAAkg/eCBtvhpRhRY/s1600/07082012150.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
              <p>Bendies bendies everywhere. Parked here there everywhere. I
              lived at Woodlands till 1999 and I was appalled at what had
              happened to WRI. Chaos everywhere.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> </p>
              <p>The SL hogging bus-bay problem had always been there since day
              1. But the problem has gone out of control with the influx of
              bendies (1999 saw only box bendies) and the increased fleet size
              and crowds. Mind you, the last picture was taken at 9pm. There were
              plenty of bus-lots outside, but nobody wants to walk the 200m to
              and 200m fro to the main part of the interchange, hence all the
              haphazard parking.</p>
              <p>******</p>
              <p>And then my 169 came, I was glad. I looked forward to a ride on
              0405, but I regretted it almost immediately.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsyMM8Xk3Go">SMRT woes</a></p>
              <p>I left the bus, 812G, at Yishun because I was very sure that the
              bus wasn't going to make it to AMK. It's very normal for many buses
              to make grinding sounds with the driving axle, but this one was
              grinding and making intense vibrations that suggest that something
              was EXTREMELY wrong with the axle.</p>
              <p>The gears were failing to engage all the time, and you guys like
              the ZF yowling right? Maybe you would love this bus. The cat-calls
              indicate gear-switch, and this one was whining, screaming, howling
              all the time as the gearbox hunted all the gears and then failed to
              engage ANY of them.</p>
              <p>I honestly feared for my life as the bus went up a hill and
              friggin lost its gear and started slowing all the way to a crawl
              before the SL who was desperately feathering his throttle to coax
              the bus to move on managed to engage 2nd.</p>
              <p>I have sat in lorries with problematic gearboxes that went from
              60 to -10 and this was a repeat of a nightmare. I had enough and
              alighted at Yishun to take the video posted above. I am sorry that
              my video cut off half-way due to lack of memory, but listen at the
              end. First the bus failed to engage 1st. Then the bus failed to
              engage 2nd and the RPM sky-rocketed.</p>
              <p>And what was more amazing, the SL did not declare break-down! By
              comparison, SBST BCs usually declare break-down because this is
              potentially dangerous.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>P.S: To add insult to injury, I pressed the bell, and it did not
              work. I pressed another bell and it didnt work either.
              smlj.....luckily it was Yishun Int and many people needed to get
              down anyway.</p>
              <p>Kinda reminded me of my experience with bells on the OC500,
              except I was at the front, and there was NONE. I got fed up and
              told the nice SL that I wanted to get down at the next stop
              instead.</p>

              <p>Even if SMRT stop using bendies, the situation will be the same. SLs will still anyhow park their buses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The situation has always been there.</p>
              <p>But clearly made worse, a lot worse by bendies.</p>
              <p>Just 2 bendies in front, and a 168 DD caused my bus to be stuck within the bowels of the interchange.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr311/SBS1908B/IMG_5982.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in WRI, reversing out of the saw-tooth berths to leave upon embarking passengers is the norm there because bendies in the next berth frequently block the bus behind from leaving. Ultimately, bendies and DDs also have only 1 entrance, and it takes forever to load the crowd taking 900, to cite one popular service. It gets more complicated when 2 bendies arrive, as is common, for a single berth. Common practice is for the 2nd bendy to leave a gap to allow bus from the preceding berth to leave, but that causes blockage for the main road. How then?</p>
              <p>I never said that bendies are terrible, but the infrastructure does not support such buses and it really is in the interest of the public to phase them out, as SBS saw back then.</p>
              <p>I haven't seen any further acommodation for bendies and I can safely say that there won't be any more bendies.</p>
              <p>Generally, LTA's plans do not materialise overnight. The hub-spoke system for example, was already the aim for many years and even decades, before it was further ratified one more step, with the distance-based fare. These can in fact, be all be traced back to the building of towns, revolving around MRT and bus interchanges, and best exemplified in vertical integration, with the WRI arrangement. </p>

              <p>Do you know what is the Hatfield accident?</p>
              <p>Do you know "Network Rail"?</p>
              <p>If you delve deep into the inquiries and literature review,
              which I'm not sure you have full access to, then you'll see that
              the pattern of operation leading up to that accident followed
              pretty much the same moral path.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>Network Rail was to run into more problems such as its ambiguous
              position as public/private company....suggesting that the "third
              way" for public transport, between nationalisation and
              privatisation, might be less viable. Viabilitiy on the other hand,
              can be tweaked somewhat by having the proper institutions. That
