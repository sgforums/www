              <p>Since when hating bendies is practical? The creater of this thread (not me) is only 13 years old,and so what if he is childish? You can't even read still say we are childish and we can't accept facts.We find your fantasy of SMRT getting DD's is childish too,but we never said it.</p>
              <p>We can't stop people to be displeased with bendies,but please hate on them somewhere else.</p>
