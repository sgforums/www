              <p><br>singapore's bendies are actually more stable. swinging maybe people complained due to the bounciness of the back of the rear section, but lateral swinging i think its rare. rear wheel drive bendies like our O.405's tend to have a heavier rear section, with the axle, engine and gearbox all at the rear. hence, the rear end tends to be steadier, unless we're talkin about slippery ice roads, then any bus wouldn't stand a chance at all. bendies that tend to swing are mostly those with the driving force in the middle axle, and the engine up front (B10m), leading to a very light rear section, and so, has more tendency to swing. then again, the buses in singapore rarely travel fast enough to make the rear end swing, and even if it were to be a B10M, or any other bus with engine and drive in the front section, from what i see all over the net, such cases rarely happen unless:</p>

              <p>Frankly this is what drivers should be trained for. But on a practical sense, these training are very expensive to hold. I understand that Scania has training camps which include defensive driving and such for coach and truck drivers but for citybus drivers I guess the cost to train one with these skills is still high (and maybe unnecessary?)...</p>

              <p><br>Actually if wanna compare, bendies can turn better than any DDs around. I still think bendies are much better, and it really benefits SMRT, as I still dun think SMRT will be getting DDs in near future, and more rigids will mean more drivers needed, I think LTA will somehow lift the ban one day.</p>

              <p>This also applies to truck and trailer applications dude. Does that mean these trucks &amp; trailer are to be banned as well? A smart driver will know not to approach these vehicles when they are turning or cornering, or to approach with caution. Most long vehicles have a wide turning radius and drivers should know this. The back of the bendy bus have a long vehicle sticker. The driver should take caution when approaching them.</p>

              <p>can take caution, but the bendies's speed is not controlled when turning it causes havoc as well. dun forget, our lanes are very narrow, even experienced drivers would also end up having to slow down esp right turn into YIS Int w/ right lane being e fast lane beside filter lane</p>
              <p><br>I think it all boils down to e skill of e driver. We can end up drivers driving bendies as if it's a SD</p>
              <p>those driving 20ft or 40ft TEU trailers, tat's their daily cari makan job. you can see how well they can steer the trailer safely</p>
              <p>so it's to get rid of e bendies to reduce safety hazard since there are alternative DDs.. as for 20ft and 40ft, get rid of them, then our PSA should handover 30m of containers of biz to M'sia?</p>

              <p>I like bendies for the fact that they can take on and offload pax at a very fast rate. One example would be service 184. When approaching Clementi MRT stop, the bus is packed to the door during peak hours. Meanwhile the amount of people waiting to board 184 at that stop will take up 3/4 of the bus. The time taken for this exchange of passengers is roughly 2-4mins, which is really fast. Not sure of the exact time, might have to check again when i got time.</p>

              <p>According to the Basic Theory Test book (Or Advance, cant rmbr as i read my friend's book. I havent taken the test yet), even if you are on the fast lane, its your responsibility to check for hazards and beside you when the road narrows down. If need be, you should slow down. A bendy bus's rear portion would not petrude alot into the lane, more or less only 1/10th of the lane, which isnt alot. Also, when approaching junctions you should slow your speed a little. This slowing can help you notice this hazard when the bus is turning, therefore if need be, the driver will signal first then check side mirrors and blindspot and change lanes if need be.</p>
              <p>You havent seen trailer drivers who drove haphazardly. These monsters can be more deadlier than bendy buses.</p>
