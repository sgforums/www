            <div class='col-md body'>In this world, nothing is perfect. We see people complaining aircon buses too cold on rainy days, yet some "have aircon like no aircon".<br><br>Let me try to have a neutral stand here. Service 265 is a Townlink service, but how many passengers take from end to end? The most is you are in the bus for 20 minutes. I know because I was a regular on 265.<br><br>Sidetrack a little, yet again, we see people urging for fully aircon fleet for bus companies, yet they don't want fare hikes. They want this and that features on the bus, but fare hike is a no-no. Sometimes we need to understand, when the bus co are trying to meet demands for commuters, they have to invest in money. No pain no gain, in this context, no hike no improvement.<br><br>Bus deployments are also determined by travel pattern throughout the day. If the service you take doesn't consist of many aircon buses, or only have aircon buses during certain periods, all I can say is too bad. So don't complain about this service no aircon that service so many new aircon buses. The world doesn't revolve around you. Sometimes they have to make tough decisions like this, not because they like it, but they have constraints.<br><br>For those who are wealthy enough, take a cab. For those who aren't as fortunate, get a life and live with it. Be glad you have buses to ferry you around. Wait till the day when a road is closed and no bus to ply a particular route, I can foresee loads of complaints again.<br><br>Bus companies can NEVER satisfy and pacify every single passenger.</div>
