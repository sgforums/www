            <div class='col-md body'>You guys could alwayz take a Taxi if you feel that you dont deserve a NAC bus... Theres only one thing that i can say.. itz not the fact that SBST is trying to pamper some of the services over another service.. But the fact that you guys are the one who are over-pampered.. i do not see a problem of a NAC bus yrs ago.. But why now.. ? Reason is simple.. Singaporeans are over-relying on a thing called Aircon.. Must we have AC for wherever that we go ? No.. we dont need that actually.. itz the fact that singporeans are getting more and more demanding and not trying to give anything in exchange.. itz like what some people says.. If you wan the other party to respect you.. you respect the other party 1st.. dont expect the other party to respect you when you dont respect the other party.. Think about it.. will riding a NAC bus for 30mins kill you.. ?? Come on.. if thats the case.. how have you lived in singapore for that past 10 or even 20yrs ?? If you cant even bear with the heat that we have.. i do suggest that you migrate to some other countries..  Yes.. i do agree with what striderz_0405 had said.. they do have their own restriction.. You people complained about NAC buses on service like 265.. okay.. think of another way.. SBST take out all the NAC buses on 265 and put them on let say.. Service 130.. Would you be happy ? The answer will alwayz be a N-O NO.. correct? or you would like to see it on service 130 ? (i could alwyz feedback to SBST regarding to that..). No matter what service that teh NAC gonna be on, Singaporeans will alwayz bound to complain.. Im not surprise that we are being labelled as a country whereby people makes complain during their free time.. you guys complain that buses are arriving infrequently (e.g.15mins). Once again.. will 15mins of wait kill ?? bear in mind there are some developed countries whereby people have to wait for up to 2hrs for a bus.. I know how do you people feel regardin the fare hike and all that stuffs.. but for me, i still do consider that the Bus fare is cheap.. take HK for example.. their fares are usually S$0.8-S$4.. yes.. they do have modern and newly buses as compared to Singapore.. but bear in mind.. HK transport system started much more earlier as compared to singapore.. Just give SBST/SMRT more time to improve and buy in new buses..</div>

It is through the aircon monthly stamps, as I have checked, there are no longer NAC stamps on sale. Those svs that are majority NAC, though adult passenger pay less, SBS can ean add $10 per mth on each student or NSmen as they take NAC buses daily... Next, such buses often ends up overloaded, meaning collecting higher fares than it should.<br><br>So think again when SBS decides on a fare hike... The 1 cent can mean millions of dollars a year<br><br>Also, bus brunching though it is strictly a no no, yet time and time Svs esp like 8 and 23 have 3 ADDs arriving together (Either front is packed, behind is empty or all are totally empty)... Such svs are running at a loss! Though the drivers wages are fixed, dun ever forget the fuel...

This is a bus forums whereby peopel come in here and exchange or share their knowledge for buses.. Singapore Forums -- Bus Forums is NOT a place where you people come in here for complain.. if you are not happy with the service that SBST/SMRTB/SMRT is providing, go ahead and complain/feedback to their respective companies and NOT at this very forums.. this is Singapore Buses Forum.. NOT Singapore Bus Complain Forums.. THInk about it... So what if you complain over here ? theres nothing that we can do about it.. the bus still have to stay on that particular service.. If you really hate the NAC bus on 265.. Go ahead and take a cab.. By scolding a fellow bus fans inside here shows that you are someone who dont respect other people.. you are like those kinda people that ive said before.. You dont respect other people while you expect other people to respect you all the time.. What do you think this place is ?? a place where you can flame our fellow forumates just because you dont like the NAC bus on 265.. ? Do not treat this place whereby you can do whatever that you like.. Go take a Cab or buy a car.. Suggest that you take bus the next time when you go out.. since you dont like the NAC bus..</div>
