Furthermore, Tibs pulled out quite a few services following the WDL extension (but were forced to partially reinstate 950). The takeover of the northern region (from BPJ toSKG) in a way was to "compensate" for losing some WDL routes when the future MRT extension was open.<br><br>Also note that PGL was hived off from SKG and given its own route group in 12/2003 with SBST in charge. Even though SBW developed earlier than these 2 estates, it still doesn't have its own bus interchange (but could have it by Christmas). In a way, SBST seems to be doing a better job with north-east routes. It is likely Tibs preferred a slow approach to SKG and PGL (like what they did in SBW) so as not to overtax themselves, but the government's decision not to have a subway monopoly spoilt all their plans.</div>
