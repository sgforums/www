Similar trains as those on the existing lines could have been deployed. The NEL fares may have been more similar to the existing fares as the cost of running the system would be lower than a fully-computerised one as it is now.<br><br>Anyway, if Tibs were the landlord at SKG Int, it would be built to accommodate articulated buses, just as WDL and BPJ were.</div>

Similar trains as those on the existing lines could have been deployed. The NEL fares may have been more similar to the existing fares as the cost of running the system would be lower than a fully-computerised one as it is now.<br><br>Anyway, if Tibs were the landlord at SKG Int, it would be built to accommodate articulated buses, just as WDL and BPJ were.</div></blockquote>Who knows?<br><br>Anyway... Dun ever think they custom build SKG Int for the operators, dun forget, the bldg is built by pte developers.. And they based on the design of majority of the buses i.e thats SD and DD as they are more common on SG roads</div>
