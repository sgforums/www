            <div class='col-md body'>On sunday 01 Feb, I boarded a service 145 bus (SBS 181L) heading towards Buona Vista. At 7.45pm, when the bus reached the junction of Telok Blangah Rd and Henderson Rd, the driver kept switching on and off the lights and air con inside the bus. The passengers were wondering what happened, then the engine went off and on again, phasing at the junction for a while when the traffic lights have turned green.<br><br>Upon reaching the stop along Henderson Rd, the driver on and off the switch again numerous times, after which he got off the seat and announced to the passengers that the air con broke down, and he want all of us to alight and transfer to the next bus.<br><br>However, a few passengers including senior citizens told the driver that they are alright without the air con and the driver should just continue with the journey, also they don't want to spend time waiting for the next bus as they said the frequency is very poor. So the driver announced that he will not pick up any passengers for the rest of the trip, then he removed the front and side destos. When the bus stopped at a junction, he will open the front and rear doors for short ventilation.<br><br>So I was in this "off service" 145 bus to Queenstown, which only has alighting activities. The passengers at the bus stops, inside the buses opposite along the route all looked at the bus when they saw a bus with no desto but with passengers inside.<br><br>A question, when the driver switchs off and on the air con, why are the lights inside the bus affected too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the air-con and lights are all under one switch, which prob is the control for all 'electrical' equipments in the bus as well.. as we can recall, there was no air-con controller on these O405s with a LCD screen stating the temperature so it is prob integrated with the rest of the 'electrical circuit'.. the interesting thing is that the TVMobile has its own switch as we see on the right of the driver (doors' switches area) as it was added on later..</div>

That goes the same for many other trees in Singapore, and some of them is right in the heart of the City area. Tree conservation is not about where it was planted, but more to when it was planted. We are talking about historical value rather than location.<br><br>Remember the uproar stirred when a construction company chopped down a 100+ year-old tree along Upper Changi Road North? The said tree is said to be the last one standing in Singapore's soil. That tree species gave Changi its name.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Superbus:</div><div class="quote_body">Changi is not a nature reserve, but a large number of trees there has been marked for conservation. That goes the same for many other trees in Singapore, and some of them is right in the heart of the City area. Tree conservation is not about where it was planted, but more to when it was planted. We are talking about historical value rather than location.<br><br>Remember the uproar stirred when a construction company chopped down a 100+ year-old tree along Upper Changi Road North? The said tree is said to be the last one standing in Singapore's soil. That tree species gave Changi its name.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div></blockquote>Talking about Changi, services 2, 9 and 89 can use DD to ply the area, esp. for service 2 along Upp Changi Rd North as the trees are very near to the road. I think NParks has trimmed them to let a DD pass safely.<br></div>

If they can do it at Changi, no reason why they can't do it at other places. Trimming branches which posed hazard to the general public, even on a precious tree, cannot be compromised. But then again, we are talking about trimming trees for DDs to pass.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>
