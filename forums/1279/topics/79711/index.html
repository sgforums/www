SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Bedok Bus Interchange</strong><br>- I have passed by this bus interchange, but havent actually visited it, sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Bishan Bus Interchange</strong><br>- Hmmm... The bus interchange is really big, but it seemed that it hadnt been put to actually good use. Only 5 bus services terminate here when there should be more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wholly SBS Transit.<br><strong>Boon Lay Bus Interchange</strong><br>- Hmmm... This bus interchange seriously needs a bit of expansion, because sometimes I do see insufficient bus parkings over there, for it's very busy bus interchange <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Do wonder what's the empty site beside the bus interchange going to be used for? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Bukit Batok Bus Interchange</strong><br>- I'm feeling neutral about this bus interchange, no comments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wholly SMRT Buses.<br><strong>Bukit Merah Bus Interchange</strong><br>- Hmmm... It certainly looks better after renovations <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No comments <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Individual control rooms for the two bus companies. SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange</strong><br>- The bus interchange is unique in the means that, the interchange looks simple and that the control room stands behind the bus parking lots, and not in the main building itself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Wholly SMRT Buses.<br><strong>Buona Vista Bus Terminal</strong><br>- BlessingSatan, it's supposed to be a terminal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Feeling neutral about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wholly SBS Transit.<br><strong>10 Changi Airport Terminal 1 Bus Station</strong><br>- Hmmm... It's conveniently located. It's beside NTUC, where passengers could purchase items before they proceed to the bus station. Locating beside the entrance makes it conveniently for those arriving at the airport by bus <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Changi Village Bus Terminal</strong><br>- I havent visited this bus terminal, sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Wholly SBS Transit.<br><strong>12 Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange</strong><br>- Hmmm... This bus interchange's okay, with a NTWU canteen beside the control room itself. I've been in the service captains' lounge before, and it's quite spacious! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Wholly SMRT Buses.<br><strong>Clementi Bus Interchange</strong><br>- Hmmm... It seemed to me that the bus interchange's too small for its intended amount of passengers during peak hours... Wholly SBS Transit.<br><strong>Eunos Bus Interchange</strong><br>- The bus interchange is spacious, but have only a few bus services plying this bus interchange... SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Ghim Moh Bus Terminal</strong><br>- I havent visited this bus terminal, sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>16 Harbourfront Bus Interchange</strong><br>- BlessingSatan, it had already been converted into a bus interchange when the NEL started operations <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, this bus interchange's unique in the means that it doesnt have multi-bus service booths but individual ones. In addition, there're individual control rooms for the two bus companies.

SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Lim Chu Kang Bus Terminal</strong><br>- Well... Before I visited this bus terminal, I thought it would've been better than what I thought. In fact, I'm disappointed because the Service 175 buses didnt even have proper parking lots! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Wholly SMRT Buses.<br><strong>Lorong 1 Geylang Bus Terminal</strong><br>- Hmmm...

The control room is in the centre of the bus terminal, jointly shared by the SBS Transit and SMRT Buses' timekeepers. The SBS Transit buses parked on the side near the entrance of the bus terminal, and the SMRT Buses parked right inside, extremely near the control room entrance. SBS Transit domination.<br><strong>Sims Place Bus Terminal</strong><br>- Counted as a roadside bus terminal, with the control room in a container.

Couldnt they just construct some more booths for future use? Anyway, it's a unique bus interchange because it's under a MRT station and without aircon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> With two control rooms, one at the parking lots and another in the main building.

Needs expansion to accomodate the large numbers of JIS buses there. Or maybe can reroute some JIS services to Jurong East or Bukit Batok?<br><br><strong>Bedok Int</strong><br>Big, busy, and dirty. Needs upgrading. Very well linked. Perhaps even the best linked of all interchanges.<br><br><strong>Bukit Merah Int</strong><br>For a quiet neighborhood, the Int is relatively busy. Large parking space but not enough berths / space for pax.<br><br><strong>Bukit Panjang Int</strong><br>Good sized interchange. But needs more links than only to western / city area.<br><br><strong>Bukit Batok Int</strong><br>Quite quiet, but nice interchange. Can do with a few more services.<br><br><strong>Choa Chu Kang Int</strong><br>Not bad an interchange. Just needs more services.<br><br><strong>Clementi Int</strong><br>Too crowded, cramped and small. Dirty and very bad on rainy days as well. Needs the most upgrading out of all interchanges!<br><br><strong>Eunos Int</strong><br>Huge but a real ghost town. Needs much more services. Maybe some Bedok services can be shortened to Eunos?<br><br><strong>HarbourFront Int</strong><br>Pleasant interchange, quiet and bright. But needs more space / berths.<br><br><strong>Hougang Ctrl Int</strong><br>Now very busy and bus parking always crowded since the closure of Hougang South, but a bright and spacious interchange.<br><br><strong>Jurong East Int</strong><br>Big but very underutilized. Bright, spacious and clean.<br><br><strong>Pasir Ris Int</strong><br>Quite small but just sufficient for the number of services there. Maybe it needs expansion if more services are diverted / created @ Pasir Ris.<br><br><strong>Punggol Temp Int</strong><br>Nice interchange, but underutilized. It could do being the perm interchange of Punggol already. Very quiet.<br><br><strong>Sengkang Int</strong><br>Small, dark and cramped. Far cry from Toa Payoh.<br><br><strong>Serangoon Int</strong><br>OK interchange, quiet and lots of space, but a little too dark.<br><br><strong>Tampines Int</strong><br>The best or second best (to Woodlands) of the "Big 4" (Woodlands / Tampines / Bedok / Boon Lay), busy and bright and reasonable space. Berths too few for the large number of parking spaces available though, maybe its because most services in Tampines do not need too much space. Maybe to make more berths they can change the 3 fixed berths (23, 8, 81) to a set of 9 queue lines (3 lines per berth).<br><br><strong>Toa Payoh Int</strong><br>Aircon, bright, spacious, and very well connected. I daresay its my favorite interchange. Very good for a relatively small town like Toa Payoh.<br><br><strong>Yishun Int</strong><br>Lots of space, not too noisy, and bright. Nice interchange. Its connections to the rest of Singapore is OK.<br><br><strong>Woodlands Reg Int</strong><br>A little too big for my comfort, but it has lots of space and bright enough. Good interchange. I like the basement design also.</div>
