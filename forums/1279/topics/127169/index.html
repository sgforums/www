            <div class='col-md body'>What i can remember is that Svc 4 was originally from Bedok Int - St Michael's Ter. Afterwards, it merged with Svc 19 (originally plying between Bedok Int - Pasir Ris). Then it's route got cutback to ply from Tampines Int instead, together with Svc 8 (originally Pasir Ris - Toa Payoh)</div>
