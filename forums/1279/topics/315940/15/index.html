              <p><br>Oh.i didnt know if SBS303C's lifespan was extended before its accident.and i didnt know this at first before someone explained in this forum how SLBP Merc can even cameo on svcs on the day before they are going to be deregistered and how AMDEP lay up their Merc very fast a few weeks before their lifespan expiry date due to their large amount of taking in kubs and that why SLBP has so many SP Mercs is that is has shortage of buses.that is how i got to know this depot stunts.i get to know all this info from this forum not by myself.</p>
