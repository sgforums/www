              <p>Dunno ley...Maybe cuz I was in uniform bah... No lah, I actually planned to take a N113 on 58 full route to Pasir Ris then back to Toa Payoh.. Then waited for very long only got Striders and Mark 4's.. So in the end the DM3500 was the one I took lor.. Then reaching Pasir Ris then saw the N113 going back Bishan -.- By that time alr wait very long since you know 58 freq like 25 mins one bus mah.. So boh bian no time to joyride full route and I saw 59 on the route that coincide with 6 and first time didn't press cuz I didn't see then I press second stop lor.. I think is because that stop nobody alight one and besides, 6 mostly serves for the workers in the Loyang district so maybe they thought why student siao gina take 6 for what... (Assuming they didn't know there were bus-fans and this bus was gonna be scrapped soon)</p>

              <p>Edit: I saw one N113 on svc 28 today... The back got a green colour ad and I think it was on svc 58 (the one I saw heading back for bishan) what ish the rego no?</p>

              <p><br>Its SBS3681R.look at the anything unsual on the road thread.i posted it there also.QX179R posted it also.BTW,i and scania lov3r took 182M that day.and the bus was packed with foreign workers all speaking different languages.and most of them were staring at us since we were the only boys on the bus.and we felt so weird since they were all staring at us.i know they were stunned to see two boys on 182M which is more worse than 6 as it goes almost everywhere inside tuas and almost touches malaysia.we were joyriding on 182M as the merc buses are also going off.BTW,182M middle part of the route runs on the borderline of malaysia and it u-turns at tuas checkpoint.and majority or all of its passengers are all foreign workers.so you can imagine the stares you will be getting if you take 182 or 182M.</p>

              <p><br>Yah.what to do.a lot of people including me are going to miss the merc and scania N113CRBs.this buses power are irreplaceable and will be greatly missed by a lot of people including non bus fans.even my father says old buses are very powerful and strong.even in my class,all my non bus fan friends said that they love the mercedes benz 0405 and scania N113CRB buses because of their true power and fantastic perfomance.no matter what,new buses cant replace that power and perfomance of old buses.this is what my friends,father and i all beleive.but to bad.LTA controls all this.scrap means must scrap.sadly,we cant do anything.but not to worry.we still got another 2 years to enjoy this merc buses before they are scrapped.enjoy them as much as you can now.</p>
