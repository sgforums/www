            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, when more K230s are placed on the services or any re-deployments to replace the existing n113s, most of the Scania N113s based at BNDEP were also placed on lay up before de-registering (the same case like AMDEP O405s)..Some of the buses turn to Spare Buses I must say for a short while, before they gone to lay up.. Majority of the NACs acquired for Training Buses based at HGDEP were also gone for lay up and de-registered, leaving some Training Buses behind like SBS3590U, till its lifespan expiry.. For SBS3689U, its life cut short to 2 years when the bus met an accident happened along Holland Rd in 1992 and it was an NAC bus at that time.. NAC to CAC conversion for n113s only starts somewhere only in 1997 onwards..</div>

              <p>You're right, I've rode on this bus very often and the engine sounds like it'd stall everytime the bus slows down and when it accelerates from a standstill.</p>

              <p><br>Go take SBS75K.that bus engine sounds very cool.it is quite unique.it is very loud and it sounds like as if something is stuck and rattling inside the engine.i took it that day on 19.it sped non-stop all the way along Tam ave 7 from the stop after Tam JC until the stop before Tam Int.it also overtook a CAC N113CRB on 38.and the engine was giving a totally different sound unlike its usual engine sound.as i was seating all the way at the back,i could feel the heat rising in my body as the bus sped more and more.and the feeling was great.i must say it was the most exciting and fantastic N113 ride i ever took.aircon is also good.</p>

              <p><br>Haha.but the BC driving SBS3635A the day we took it,was a quite young BC with spiky hair.skin looks quite tanned.but he is a nice BC.he was the same BC who drove SBS8031J,while SBS8031J was perm 6.he immediately smiled at us when we put the coins and took the ticket.and he drove SBS3635A very fast too at loyang.the bus sped quite fast at loyang ave too.and the weather was very hot when we took SBS3635A at around 10am.a few hours later it started to rain heavily.luckily we caught that bus at 10am.it was a nice ride.</p>
