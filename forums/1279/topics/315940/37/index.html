              We (bus fans)  over here wanna thank all N113CRBs for doing very good job and good bus among SBS and SBS Transit for 20 years in Singapore roads.
              
              We will be missing N113CRBs (interior, engine sound and the exterior), aircon and non-aircon bus as N113CRBs go to heaven, we will always remember N113CRBs in our memories..
              
              So long and have good rest in peace. We always be there for N113CRBs..
