The services are as follows:<br><br>SBS Transit: 40, 228, 265, 268 and 506<br>SMRT Buses: 173, 180, 184 and 189<br><br>With the introduction of this feature, bus drivers no longer need to update the fare stages manually, and this will eradicate human error in the updating of fare stages and hence, ensure accurate fare deduction. The automated updating feature will be introduced on all buses progressively.<br><br><strong>How are bus fare stages updated automatically?</strong><br><br>The system which allows for the automated updating of fare stages is the Vehicle Location System (VLS) - a satellite-based bus tracking system developed by LTA, which makes use of a combination of technologies, including Global Positioning System, to determine the position of the bus.<br><br>VLS determines the fare stage by matching the bus' actual location on the road against a pre-programmed set of data in the system. When a bus has travelled a certain distance, the system will compare this information with the data and automatically determines the fare stage.<br><br><strong>Ensuring accurate updating of fare stage</strong><br><br>Under VLS, fare stages are updated as the bus travels to the next bus stop. Therefore, the ez-link Card readers will only be activated when the bus is 100 metres away from the next bus stop, after the fare stage has been updated.<br><br>When the bus closes its door and leaves the bus stop, the readers at the exit will be de-activated. The readers at the entry will remain active for another 30 seconds after the door closes, to give commuters who have boarded the bus enough time to tap their ez-link Cards.<br><br>When the readers are activated, commuters will able to see the fare stage displayed on the LCD screen. Commuters should tap their ez-link Cards only when the readers are activated.<br><br>Readers that are not activated will have the sign displayed on the screen. Commuters should not tap their cards on the readers when they see this sign. Please see attached <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Write-up%20on%20VLS.ppt" rel="nofollow">write-up</a> for details.<br><br>Stickers at exit doors of buses and posters at bus interchanges will remind commuters on the changes to how the card readers operate.<br><br><strong>Rigorous testing conducted</strong><br><br>Since the VLS was installed on the buses in December 2003, LTA, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses have been conducting extensive tests to verify the updating of fare stages and fine-tune the system to ensure accuracy. Tests were carried out on individual bus routes and buses to ensure the system is robust and reliable before implementation.<br><br>In the event of a system error, the bus drivers will manually update the fare stages. Bus operations will not be affected and commuters can tap their ez-link Cards as usual.<br><br>SBS Transit and SMRT Buses will monitor the performance of the system and roll out the services progressively.<br><br>For queries, members of the public can call the following hotlines:<br><br>SBS Transit Customer Service Hotline : 1800-287 2727<br><br>SMRT Information Centre : 1800-336 8900<br><br>LTA Customer Service Line : 1800-225 5582<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read <a href="http://www.ezlink.com.sg/FAQ/VLSfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">this</a> from EZ-Link Pte Ltd.<br><br>mirror:<br><br><strong>Q1  :  What is the Vehicle Location System (VLS)? How does it work?</strong><br>The Vehicle Location System (VLS) is a satellite-based bus tracking system. It makes use of a combination of a few technologies, including the Global Positioning System (GPS), to determine the position of the bus.<br><br><strong>Q2  :  How does the fare stage get updated using VLS? What happens if the bus does not stop at certain bus stops? Will the fare stage still get updated? </strong><br>VLS operates through employing four main components on the bus:<br>i) A GPS Receiver, which provides vehicle location co-ordinates via satellite signals;<br>ii) A Distance Converter, which converts odometer pulses into distance travelled based on the odometer calibration constant;<br>iii) Configuration Data, which contains tables on fare stages of each bus stop, bus stop surveyed co-ordinates, inter-bus stop surveyed distance, odometer calibration constant and radius of certainty; and<br>iv) A Central Processing Unit, which compares the actual readings on the roads against the Configuration Data.<br><br>The fare stage of a bus is determined first by the distance travelled. This is carried out by the distance converter which converts the pulses recorded by the odometer to distance travelled. This data is then matched against the<br>pre-programmed set of Configuration Data in the system. If the actual readings match those in the Configuration Data, the fare stage will be updated accordingly.<br><br>When the bus pulls over at the next bus stop and opens its doors, VLS will also check the co-ordinates of its location, via the satellite signal received from the antenna mounted on the rooftop of the bus, against the Configuration Data. If the actual readings match those in the Configuration Data, the fare stage will be adjusted accordingly.<br><br>As the GPS signal serves as a secondary means of confirming the fare stage, VLS is able to allow accurate fare stage updating even if the bus does not stop at every bus stop.<br><br><strong>Q3  : Why do we need VLS? What are the benefits of VLS?</strong><br>VLS tracks the location of the bus, which in turn determines its fare stage. This means bus drivers need no longer update fare stages manually. It eliminates human error, thereby reducing the chances of charging commuters the wrong fare.<br><br><strong>Q4  : Will the implementation of VLS resolve the problem of over-charging completely?</strong><br>VLS will ensure accurate fare deduction. Commuters will still need to tap their ez-link Cards when they are alighting to ensure the correct fares are deducted.<br><br><strong>Q5  : How does VLS affect the operations of the ez-link Card system?</strong><br>No, the VLS is unlikely to affect the operations of the ez-link Card system. On the other hand, it is the introduction of the ez-link Card system that has allowed us to develop the VLS to ensure correct deduction of fares. This was not possible in the past without the ez-link Card system.<br><br>However, some commuters may take some time to adjust to tapping their cards for exit only when they are near the bus stop they intend to alight at. We have tried to mitigate this by activating all the readers, both at the entrance and exit doors, a good 100 metres before the next bus stop. This should give commuters ample time to tap their cards.<br><br>For entry processing, we do not foresee any problems as the majority of commuters tap their ez-link Cards while the bus is at the bus stop, so they are unlikely to be affected by these changes.<br><br><strong>Q6  : Why did the VLS take so long to be implemented?</strong><br>VLS is a complex system that affects the entire bus operation. LTA and the operators have to conduct extensive tests on individual bus routes and buses to ensure the system is robust and reliable before implementation.<br><br>The first trial started as early as June 2003. Over four weeks, 200 students tried out the system on buses along 17 service routes. Another round of testing involving 35 service routes was carried out in April this year. Results from both tests have enabled us to fine-tune the system and verify the Configuration Data, such as route distances and bus stop co-ordinates.<br><br><strong>Q7  : How reliable is the VLS? What are the procedures in place to ensure that the operation of buses is not affected when there is a VLS or GPS failure?</strong><br>We have conducted comprehensive tests on the VLS to ensure that the system is robust and reliable before implementation.<br><br>In the event that there is a failure with the VLS or GPS, bus drivers will manually update the fare stages. Bus operations will not be affected and commuters can tap their ez-link Cards as usual.<br><br><strong>Q8  : Will there be any public education or publicity on VLS?</strong><br>There will be stickers placed at the exit doors of buses to inform commuters of the changes to the operation of the card readers. Posters will also be put up at the bus interchanges to familiarise commuters with these changes.<br><br><strong>Q9  : Currently, commuters can tap their ez-link Cards at the exit doors at any point in time while on the bus. With the implementation of the VLS, they will not be able to do so any more. Will this not slow down alighting time? </strong><br>Commuters who wish to tap their cards in advance to exit process can continue to do so with the implementation of VLS. There is ample time for them to do so as all readers are programmed to allow processing 100 metres before reaching the next bus stop.<br><br>Commuters may also continue to entry or exit process at the front readers, and exit process at the readers at the exit doors while the bus is at the bus stop.<br><br><strong>Q10: How would commuters know when they can start tapping on the card readers to exit process? </strong><br>Commuters can start tapping their cards after the "Reader Disabled" logo on the readers goes off 100 metres before the next bus stop. Alternatively, they can tap their cards after the bus stops at the bus stop and before they alight from the bus. The latter is already the most common method used by commuters today. There will be no change to this even after the launch of the VLS.<br><br><strong>Q11: How many buses will be involved in this first phase of rollout? </strong><br>We will roll out VLS on nine service routes this Sunday, 1 August 2004. They involve a total of 88 buses.<br><br>41 buses are from SMRT Buses. They ply service numbers 173, 180, 184 and 189. The remaining 47 buses are from SBS Transit. The buses ply service numbers 40, 228, 265, 268 and 506.<br><br><strong>Q12: Wouldn't it be less confusing for commuters if VLS is rolled out on all buses at the same time? </strong><br>LTA and the bus operators have decided to roll out VLS in phases to better manage the implementation process. This is a cautious approach which will allow us to monitor the performance of VLS in actual operations before rolling it out on more buses.<br><br>Commuters will not experience much change, except that the ez-link Card readers will be de-activated until the fare stage gets updated 100 metres before the bus calls at the bus stop. Hence, we do not expect or foresee any major problems with the implementation of VLS.<br><br></div>

What happens if the bus does not stop at certain bus stops? Will the fare stage still get updated?<br>"VLS operates through employing four main components on the bus:<br>i) A GPS Receiver, which provides vehicle location co-ordinates via satellite signals;<br>ii) A Distance Converter, which <strong>converts odometer pulses into distance travelled based on the odometer calibration constant</strong>;<br>iii) Configuration Data, which contains tables on fare stages of each bus stop, bus stop surveyed co-ordinates, inter-bus stop surveyed distance, odometer calibration constant and radius of certainty; and<br>iv) A Central Processing Unit, which compares the actual readings on the roads against the Configuration Data.<br><br><strong>The fare stage of a bus is determined first by the distance travelled. This is carried out by the distance converter which converts the pulses recorded by the odometer to distance travelled.</strong> This data is then matched against the<br>pre-programmed set of Configuration Data in the system. If the actual readings match those in the Configuration Data, the fare stage will be updated accordingly.<br><br>When the bus pulls over at the next bus stop and opens its doors, VLS will also check the co-ordinates of its location, via the satellite signal received from the antenna mounted on the rooftop of the bus, against the Configuration Data. If the actual readings match those in the Configuration Data, the fare stage will be adjusted accordingly.<br><br>As the <strong>GPS signal serves as a secondary means of confirming the fare stage</strong>, VLS is able to allow accurate fare stage updating even if the bus does not stop at every bus stop."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the SMRT circular regarding VLS Phase 1 to Bus Captains, these few special points are mentioned:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> BCs should increase the farestage manually (by using Up and Down keys) to 1.5 then back to 1.0 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the boarding berth</span> before start of a new trip at the interchange/terminal. tis causes the VLS to use GPS to try to re-synchoronise the location of the bus. tis is important as some boarding berths are under shelter or underground e.g. WRI, YI, SKI, and the GPS unit may not be able to receive GPS signals.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Note: In case u dun understand wat is going on, the driver may start a new trip on the IDFC (which takes a while as it involves synchronizing info with the ez-link base station at the interchange wirelessly, and is not done at the berth) while the bus is not under shelter (like WRI, YI). the GPS using surveyed co-ordinates will confirm it is at the interchange and set the stage to 1.0. however, after the bus has a run a distance (esp. WRI) out to the underground or sheltered berths, the readings start to look go haywire: while the odometer thinks it travelled from 1.0 to 1.5, the GPS signal suggests it is at the interchange (conflict) or the GPS may have gone offline due to the shelter (set to 1.5 or not?).</span></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If manual updating is required when a bus reaches a bus stop, this should be done before the door has opened to enable the bus to re-synchronise the GPS signals when the doors open. If doors has already been opened, BCs must not close the doors within 3 seconds or else the VLS system will revert the farestage to the earlier (and wrong) one.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Note: It suggests that VLS will ask the GPS unit to re-synchronise whenever the door is open to re-confirm the location of the bus and this information will take up to 3 seconds to fetch.</span></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If BCs have consecutively skipped 10 bus stops, they are required to stop at the 11th bus stop and open the doors to allow the GPS to re-synchronise so as to correct any drift that may occur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Note: It appears the GPS unit (not the whole VLS) will only work effectively if the bus is stationary or travelling at low speeds (like walking). This could explain the need for an odometer.</span></span><br><br></div>
