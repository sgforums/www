All Bishan services are single-depot operated, Sv. 88 used to be operated by BNDEP and AMDEP till Sv. 87 was extended and handed back to BNDEP from HGDEP. Depot transfers are a very complicated affair, as seen from Sv. 159 and Sv. 163<br><br>When Sv. 159 was first extended to SK, HGDEP took over partial control of Sv. 159, explaining the DM3500 Mk IVs and Mk IIs and other Volvo buses not found inside BRAM. However, when Sv. 163 was extended, control of Sv. 159 was fully taken over by BRAM/AMDEP again and Sv. 163 was totally handed over to HGDEP.<br><br>A big mess, huh?</div>

Before Svc 163 was extended to Sengkang, the bus fleet was full of 38xx  39xx buses and Svc 159's fleet was a mixture of 5xx and 28xx buses.<br><br>After Svc 163 was extended, it went the direct opposite. The newer buses in 159 were given to 163 while 159 took all the ex-163 buses. That was back when they initially implement this. As for now, i can see Mk 3 running in 163. Svc 159 still has not much change in the bus fleet which is full of 1xx 2xx 5xx.</div>
