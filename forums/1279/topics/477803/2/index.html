              <p>Otherwise, what else can be done to ensure low fares and affordability of Public Transport?</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Actually, this may be the reason why for a period of time, SMRT emphasized a lot on building 'Xchange's at MRT stations and investing a lot on retail, because the Public Transport business is not making money and they are under pressure to not raise fares. To remain profitable as a company, SMRT invested in Retail. Now, it is investing in its Taxi business, by purchasing luxury vehicles and charging high cab charges.</span></li>
              <li>If SMRT only does Public Transport, it would have to raise PT fares to remain profitable, making PT less affordable to us.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Are you sure you want the Operators' trains and buses divisions to make profits? This would result in higher PT fares, you know?</p>

              <p>Much as I appreciated the thought put into this post, there is still a need to point out several things.</p>
              <p>1. CDG is not formerly SBS. Please google for more info.</p>
              <p>2. There is nothing wrong with cross-subsidising. In fact, cross-subsidising was what allowed Samsung to absorb years after years of huge loss-making in the DRAM market in the 1980s. The rest is now history, but few realised Samsung did not have an easy time in the earlier decades. </p>
              <p>3. Both SMRT and CDG have been cross-subsidising, especially for the bus and LRT lines. Maybe you have not realised it. The foreign markets and the engineering arms have helped in that respect.</p>
              <p>4. As a paying commuter, I want the cheapest and best where reasonably possible. Period. Why think so much? All I need is a good explanation of why fares are going up while service levels have stagnated or gone west.</p>

              <p>im not that interested in fares being affordable and cheap if the service isnt up to scratch (ie low frequency, poor maintenance etc). What matters more is that the service is up to scratch, then we talk about fares. To use very simple analysis (heck accounting maath here), if the PTOs are unable to make ends meet through simply revenue via buses/trains, they will need to scour elsewhere for money, and that will be bound to distract them especially if the other means of revenue becomes a cash cow. </p>
              <p>simply put, i will pay for buses and trains as long as the service is up to scratch. if they are corporations and need to make a profit, so be it. its a win-win situation y'kw. </p>

              in the earlier decades. </p>
              <p>3. Both SMRT and CDG have been cross-subsidising, especially for
              the bus and LRT lines. Maybe you have not realised it. The foreign

              <p>2 and 3. as for x-subsidizing, im firmly against it because it violates the principle of balancing the books (for the division thats in the red at least).

              <p>4. fully agree with you that recent rising fares should be explained in more detail. i like the way you look at it simple, but if u ask me, as long as they can convince me that rising fares can bring their books back into the black and set things straight, im okay with that as well. given how the PTOs run, im willing to forgo the cheapest fares if they wont fix the situation. </p>

              <p>Yes. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">As I mentioned yesterday, SBS Transit and SMRT are actually both owned by the Government of Singapore, just that the former is owned by Ministry of Manpower, while the latter is owned by Temasek Holdings.</span></p>
              <p>The illegal strike in 2012 is a good example that shows how related the two operators are. When SMRT faced a shortage of bus drivers due to the strike, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SBS Transit "loaned" their drivers to SMRT</span><em>. Meanwhile, there were also a few drivers from the private bus industry(probably also related to the government; upcoming 3rd public bus operator) who were also temporarily "loaned" to SMRT</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make up for the shortage of bus drivers it faced</span>.</p>
              <p>Another example is when the Downtown Line trains were delivered to Singapore in 2012. Despite the DTL belonging to SBS Transit, it was the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMRT workers</span> who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loaded the Downtown Line trains onto the track at Kim Chuan Depot</span>.<img style="float: right;" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/197593_390064507730458_496228837_n.jpg" alt="" width="914" height="608"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I also mentioned yesterday, the purpose for having two operators, despite both owned by the Government, is probably to <strong>ensure the sustainability of the Public Transport industry</strong>, and to <strong>help lower fares</strong>. </p>
              <p><em>Analogy: It is better to put your eggs in more than one basket than to put all of them in just one basket.</em></p>
              <p>Anyway, are you guys not tired?

              private bus industry(probably also related to the government;
              upcoming 3rd public bus operator) who were also temporarily
              "loaned" to SMRT</em>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to
              make up for the shortage of bus drivers it faced</span>.</p>
              <p>Another example is when the Downtown Line trains were delivered
              to Singapore in 2012. Despite the DTL belonging to SBS Transit, it
              was the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SMRT
              workers</span> who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loaded
              the Downtown Line trains onto the track at Kim Chuan
              Depot</span>.<img style="float: right;" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/197593_390064507730458_496228837_n.jpg" alt="" width="914" height="608"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I also mentioned yesterday, the purpose for having two
              operators, despite both owned by the Government, is probably to
              <strong>ensure the sustainability of the Public Transport
              industry</strong>, and to <strong>help lower
              fares</strong>. </p>
              <p><em>Analogy: It is better to put your eggs in more than one
              basket than to put all of them in just one basket.</em></p>
              <p>Anyway, are you guys not tired? I think we have already
              discussed enough on the topic of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nationalising Public
              Transport</span>. *sian* <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>

              <p>to clarify things, SMRT and SBST are NOT OWNED by the Govt of Singapore. They are listed companies, and it so happens that their major shareholders are either Temasek Holdings / GIC. having a controlling stake DOES NOT imply ownership, but more influence and control over the company. </p>
              <p>the concept of a duopoly would apply well to singapore's transport system, and having 2x PTOs WILL NOT help to reduce fares but instead further encourage fare alignment to prevent destabilization of the market should demand to swing to either PTO, theoretically.But, given that the local PTOs dont duplicate their routes, there isnt a real duopoly of sorts but localised monopolies that WILL NEVER HELP to being costs down. </p>

              <p>Personally I feel that just subsuming the operations under a single entity is better.</p>
              <p>One reason why SMRT's cost of operations is significantly higher has to do as well with its disproportionately higher number of feeder services in its route bundle. </p>
              <p>And this has to do with the way the core areas were apportioned.</p>
              <p>Cost-savings from having less start-stop operations is no small amount especially at fleet-level.</p>
