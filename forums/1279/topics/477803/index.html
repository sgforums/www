            <div class='col-md body'><p>It's a well-known fact: SMRT runs their trains far better than their buses, and SBS Transit runs their buses far better than their trains. If both of these companies merge, there would be no competition and buses and trains would run much more smoothly (not sure about SMRT Taxis though). What do you guys think?</p></div>

              <p>True, but frequency is the least of our worries because the quality for bus services will be higher (especially for prior-SMRT services) with a higher (albeit only slightly) margin of maintenance on trains and buses alike as a company. They'll probably wait till the people complain again to improve frequencies which is possible with a larger fleet at their disposal. Or not.</p>

              <p>True, there will be cons attached, but if you recall November 1973 when SBS was formed, it made things a whole lot better as far as we can see.</p>

              <p>That seems like a legit explaination, though now the fleet for SMRT is becoming more similar to SBST's, since they are purchasing DDs and as of now, they have Citaros similar to SBST.</p>

              <p>Exactly! SBST and SMRT competition isn't like how London's transport competition is.<br>And yes, I'm a commuter in CCK. We actually don't have a choice... Bus freq is still not very good. Downroute buses... heh.. boliao</p>

              <p>Even if SMRT and SBST were to merge, can you be certain that their profit-centric behaviours are going to disappear and behave like proper PTOs?! Absolutely not!</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The problem as id see it is getting corporations to provide public goods like public transit (which require subsidy and arent as profit making as expected). Pervertedboy has stated the econs case against nationalising the transport system, but to swing to the other extreme (as is the case now) isnt beneficial as our PTOs can and may cut corners to keep their books in the black (which is as, or even more impt than having the buses and trains run ontime).</span></p>
              <p>For profit-centric organizations to grasp the social implications and dimensions of their provision isnt something i want to touch on, but is something that the LTA and PTOs need to appreciate because using taxpayers dollars to bail out profit-centric PTOs (as was the case with BSEP) isnt the best way to use public funds, nor the best way to improve bus services because the govt has to absorb losses from non-profiting BSEP routes while the PTOs are just tasked to provide the buses at the prescribed frequencies. I would go as far to suggest that the PTOs take the lead to improve bus services because they know their fleet and pax better than LTA does, and to have LTA initiate all the improvement in services... hell the PTOs are getting away too easily.</p>

              <p>can you support that claim? by saying that youre suggesting that the PTOs should do MORE retail and leave their CORE COMPETENCIES to rot/die.</p>
              <p>Also, what do you mean by 'let public transport be a loss-making business?' As a division manager (retail) of a transport company, is it FAIR that my division's profits GO TO a LOSS-MAKING train/bus section? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Cross-subsidying suggests and implies that something is DEAD WRONG with a division in terms of cost management/revenue generation, and can reflect deeper and more chronic issues within the said division. As a paying commuter, Im not interested in whether the PTOs are in the black, but WHETHER their trains and buses divisions can make profits RESPECTIVELY.</p>
              <p>Onto a little history, SBST is OWNED by CDG which was formerly SBS. Bus operations of SBS were spun off to form the subsidary SBST, and SBS eventually changed name to CDG and went listed. </p>
