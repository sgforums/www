              <p>Please understand that SBST's attitude towards scheduling is different compared to SMRT's attitude towards scheduling. SMRT's schedules are as tight as possible and that is why the driver has to (dangerously) speed and go very fast, in the process breaking speed limit laws. On the other hand, SBST tends to be much more relaxed in their scheduling, the drivers do not have to drive flagrantly fast in order to keep up with schedule. Comparing SBST's DDs and SMRT's bendies speeds on highways is comparing chalk and cheese. And it occurs to me SBST does down-tune the engines of their buses in order to prolong the service life of the transmission.</p>

              <p>For all the talk about who drives faster and what....its a fact that 965 and 969 have got rubbish frequency compared to 161 and 168.</p>
              <p>Of the 4 services, the slowest driving 161 is actually the most reliable. The worst is 965.</p>
              <p>And yes.</p>
              <p>There are times when 25 goes faster than 854, but quite frankly its not that often.</p>
              <p>What happens more often with 854 is the SL speeding and not picking up angry pax.</p>

              <p>You did say bendies are the best. Go and look at what you write on your home page of userid TIB501D. Though you never claimed it properly, it still means bendies are the best. Now I understand why SBS1000U disagress with you. Plus there's no need to deploy bendy or DD when the loading is high. It's just a matter of which high capacity buses they use. Even after so long, you still dont understand why SBST cant buy bendies and why SMRT cant buy DDs. And how are you 100% sure people would take 969 instead of 39. 39 is there to help 969 tank the load in the first place. If 969 is full, people wouldn't want to waste their time to wait for the next 969. They will take 39 instead. And 39 is slow because it's using buses with low hp. Just kick out those low hp buses and kick in those high hp buses, and the matter is solved. Simple as that. </p>

              <p>You did say bendies are the best. Go and look at what you write
              on your home page of userid TIB501D. Though you never claimed it
              properly, it still means bendies are the best. Now I understand why
              SBS1000U disagress with you. Plus there's no need to deploy bendy
              or DD when the loading is high. It's just a matter of which high
              capacity buses they use. Even after so long, you still dont
              understand why SBST cant buy bendies and why SMRT cant buy DDs. And
              how are you 100% sure people would take 969 instead of 39. 39 is
              there to help 969 tank the load in the first place. If 969 is full,
              people wouldn't want to waste their time to wait for the next 969.
              They will take 39 instead. And 39 is slow because it's using buses
              with low hp. Just kick out those low hp buses and kick in those
              high hp buses, and the matter is solved. Simple as that. </p>

              <p>Okay, I did say bendies were the best based on personal likes or dislikes, but I did not mean that bendies are the best PRACTICALLY.</p>
              <p>My userid homepage was intended to be a joke, not reality, and that is also based on personal preference and not how practical it is.</p>
              <p>Plus, I actually wanted for both companies to remain using their own type of high capacity bus in future, but then again... if I type this on the DD4SMRT topic, I will get blasted by people that wanted to say that there is no rule that SMRT cannot buy DDs, then I had no choice but to follow suit with their way of thinking that SMRT should have both high capacity buses, basically to avoid getting flamed by others.</p>

              <p>Not everything can be taken as a joke.</p>
              <p>Like that John Cheng, before his <em>getai</em> performance, he lied about his heart attack, etc. And during the procedure of the <em>getai</em>, he died of an heart attack.</p>
              <p>This is a forum, and facts are presented here. Even if you lied, it is a FACT that you want to lie.</p>
