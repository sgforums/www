              <p>Both effeciency(speed) and safety(speed control) play a part.
              What if a service is considered "safe driving" but is terribly
              slow? That's how service 161 is... 161 and 969 travel roughly the
              same distance, but 161 is pathetically slow in that sense. 168 is
              faster because of the route and not the bus type or bus chassis, as
              969 passes by WDL, Gambas Ave and YIS before turning left to
              SLE.</p>
              <p>I don't expect every bus to like "die die must speed above 70",
              because safety also plays a part in this. However, have you ever
              experienced the <span style="color: #0000ff;">snail paces</span> of
              services <span style="color: #ff0000;">23, 39, 72, 81 and
              161</span>? Ouch! My butt hurts whenever I ride these services(full
              journey or at least 3/4 of the journey), worse than standing all
              the way onboard 965 or 969... <span style="color: #008000;">At
              least I like 168 which has both effeciency and safety, and also at
              the same time proves to be a very reliable service.</span></p>
              <p>Have you ever observed the boarding and alighting of service 222
              at Bedok Stn, or even 154 and 183 holding up all the buses behind
              at Clementi Station. Even if you use 3 doors DD, still have to
              climb down the steep and narrow stairs...</p>

              <p>lets be very very clear.... SBST's scheduling for highway services is better in the way they do not require the drivers to exceed speed limits or drive flagrantly fast. no such thing for SMRT, the schedules are tight enough to make the SL exceed the legal speed limit. Maybe driving at 80km/h is wonderful for speed demons like you but is not desirable in the name of safety, we don't need large flying bullets on the already dangerous highways. i have observed that most if not all of the SMRT buses on the highways exceed the speed limit, there can only be one reason for this, that the tight schedule is to be met. it is disappointing some people disregard safety in the name of 'speed' and 'effeciency'. the 161 and 168 DDs always keep to 60km/h on the highways, so the only reason that other buses such as 969 bendy buses could overtake those DDs like nobody's business was because it was driving flagrantly fast. and who needs so much horsepower for the bendies when the speed limit is only 60km/h....</p>

              <p>Do note the fact that SMRT buses also speed at non highway places. The SBST buses are not in tight schedule, so they keep up to around 50 - 60km/h on the normal roads.</p>
              <p>For the highways, SBST will only run at 70km/h, whereas you'll notice that SMRT speed at over 80km/h</p>

              <p>And when the scheduling was so tight that it took a VSO to be stopped by traffic police on the highway before they did something about speeding.</p>

              <p>903 should be alright for DDs actually. 900, 911, 912 and 913 are impractical for DDs while 901 and 902 can use it. However, 901 and 902's commuters are also mostly short-haul, like 912 and 913.</p>
              <p>For YIS, 800, 804, 811, 812 are impractical while 806 is DD-friendly. 806's commuters are mostly long haul, but it uses bendies due to fast alighting at Yishun MRT, as seen in TIB1218R's video. It took only one minute for all the pax to clear.</p>
              <p>CCK on the other hand, 302 is something like 912 and 913, so no DD. 307 is due to CCK St 62 and Teck Whye Lane so no DD, and 300 might not get DDs due to either CCK Ave 2 or the CCK Ave 5 roundabout.</p>
              <p>If SMRT gets DDs, put it on 190 and 106, and probably only on 903. 188, 851, 854 and 963 can use DDs while 169 and 969 can still stick with bendies.</p>

                              <p>If you want 161 to fly, you can go back in time during the early
              2000s.</p>
              <p>When 161 had a fleet of only 9, with a frequency of 20
              minutes.</p>
              <p>And when the scheduling was so tight that it took a VSO to be
              stopped by traffic police on the highway before they did something
              about speeding.</p>
              <p>And where strange antics by 161 BCs desperate to further
              increase the speed included the bizarre act of putting the bus in
              neutral downhill. That allowed the bus to accelerate to speeds you
              guys can scarcely believe.</p>
              <p>To what end?</p>

              <p>The 161 back then was unreliable, SD dominated fleet, and
              speeding everywhere the bus went.</p>
              <p>Is that what you guys want?<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
