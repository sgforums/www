            <div class='col-md body'>I had a rathar exciting bus ride on New Year's Eve. I was riding on sv. 154, heading to Dunearn Rd where I need to change to sv. 74 to get to my workplace. I was running late when I saw a no. 74 bus in front of my bus. Not wanting to wait for another one, which could take ages, I embarked on a "hot pursuit" in the hope of being able to overtake the no. 74 bus so that I could catch it at the next stop. Dunearn Rd after 10 pm was quite deserted and we passed a number of empty bus stops which made the chase even more difficult. Then my bus was caught at a traffic light and I thought it was all over. As I contemplated my next move, my bus caught up with that no. 74 bus and the chase resumed! But I lost out when my bus failed to overtake before Adam Rd. So I continued my journey to Whitley Rd and took a Leyland Olympian on sv. 132, my final bus ride of 2003.</div>
