You are NOT entitled to blame the transport provider if the problem is in no relation to the transport company providing the service.<br><br>Each service in Singapore got its own market of commuters using the service, be it old folks (33 147), working adults (36 100 196), students (31) or even foreign construction workers (23 66 67). Transport companies are there to provide the links between places. How these links are created are very dependent on the market that they are serving.<br><br>I wish that I could have your understanding on this matter.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

WHo says that 147 is useless.. ?? If you bever board it doenst mean that it is Useless.. Every route is there for a purpose. And.... DO you Know that 147 is The only Service into town from Hougang other than 107.. ?? Alot of people depend on 147 to get to their destination. most people in hougang would rather take 147 than the NEL is because it saves them the trouble from transferring from one mode of transport to another mode of Transport. AND.... If you take away 147, Do YOU KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS MOVES.. ?? In the NorthEast Region alone, 147 Passes by PeiCai Sec, ZhongHua Pri, Bowen Sec, XinMin Sec, XinMin Pri, Monfort Junior, Monfort Sec, Punggol Pri. And students from other school also depend on this service. And.. i dont think SBST WOULD W/d this service in the very first place.. Do you know that 147 is one of SBST's CashCow Service.. ?? I bet You DONT know this in the very first place.. If not, Why do you think SBST wuld wanna deploy 37 buses to this service in the first place ?? HAVE YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THIS OR NOT.. ?? Reason is simple.. Because this route is Ultra HIGH demand in a sense that even if you board this bus in the middle of the day.. lets say 3pm, you still can see that the 147 buses are usually 60% Full... Mind YOU.. 60% FULL DURING OFF-PEAK Hours Is not something which all other service can achieve.</div>

HG Ave 8 is quite far away from any NEL stations, even at Blk 400s and 500s also need to walk about 500m to reach Hougang station. There is still demand for 147.<br><br>In green: Serangoon Sec and Parry Pri Sch<br><br>It's just my 2 cents thought, afterall its the rationalism of SBST, what can we do?
