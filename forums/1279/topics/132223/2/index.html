I think it also occures at my school's bus stop. I just finish school, so I walked towards the bus stop to board 74 home. Just stepping out of school, I saw 74, so I ran and tried to catch the bus. I saw alot of students boarding. And I nearly reach the bus stop, the bus door had closed and waiting for the traffic to clear. I went over and tapped the door, but the BC waved his hand to me and then drove off. I think maybe the waiting time is up, because alot of students is boarding, and so wasted alot of time, so behind schedule.</div>
