(not including the known height restriction routes)</div></blockquote>My views.<br><br>Generally, the deployment of the type of buses of certain routes depends on:<br>1. the commuter profile<br>2. the popularity of the route (actually most accurately the revenue that can be generated)<br>3. the bus type's maintenance costs<br>4. weekday/weekend<br><br>1. For a route like 36, Mk IV's are the permers but not Mk III's. This is because it is the only bus link between city and airport, and hence the better buses.<br><br>2. Popular express buses tend to get better buses (Merc on 502 &amp; Mk 4's on 51<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> as the higher revenue can justify using better buses being deployed. (Don't count cameos).<br><br>3. One example of this is why 2888T is deployed on 518. Being the only express service in BNDEP, it is the best place to generate more revenue as we noe, the L94UB's maintenance cost is higher than most buses owned by SBST.<br><br>4. For some less popular or "student" routes, buses on weekends tend to be better than tat on weekdays, with more air-cons and better buses.<br><br>For special requirements (other than height restrictions), i can think of:<br>- 42 and 92 using Dennis Darts<br>- 61, 106, 970 for slope at Holland Ave (this one not too serious so cameos may still appear on 61 &amp; 106)<br>- 167 not using Bendies as the roundabout at Sembawang Park is not Bendy-friendly (there was a trial and the bus can use the roundabout but they decided not to do it)<br>- 858 for using MB O.405's as they need powerful and low-maintenance buses to take the stress of plying the whole of TPE</div>

Therefore they are usually on town or high load factor svcs like 105, 154, 174, 242, 243 &amp; 502. Also, there is the concensus within SBST that O.405's are jus as suitable as the DD's in load handling (or something along those lines), probably cos of its powerful engine. 183 is an exception now, of cos, until it gets extended to science pk 2 in due time.<br><br>And all O.405's are the same. Probably cos AMDEP has more O.405's, thus a higher number of them is expected to have some problems even though proportionately it may be the same as SLBP.
