Look at CCK, currently, the situation there is not fair. It has 67,172,188,190 going to SBS T areas but no SBST services there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>CCK and Bt Batok used to be SBST's towns.<br>They were exchanged for Seng Kang and Punggol (which used to be under TIBS).<br>Thus, alot of the routes there still run into SBST's territories. Also, if u have noticed, several SBST's services do ply by BB.<br><br></div>
