              <p>I have used 139 DD around 7pm from Toa Payoh to River Valley. So I can give you a count on that. 139 had high loading (around 70-80 pax) till Jalan Bahagia, where at one stop around 40 ppl got down. The loading after that was reduced to 30-35 pax through the route. So I can see why 139A makes sense, and I am sure they will ply the DD for this route. </p>
              <p>139 in morning peak on the contrary gets full at Jalan Bahagia and has high loading till Dhoby Ghaut (around 70-80 pax) after which the pax goes down to around 40 pax. </p>

              <p>So that would mean 43A would have a frequency of 20-25 mins if only one bus is used. Do you know which is the bus # deployed on 43A.</p>
              <p>I suspect 70B to have 2 DDs for the route to have a frequency of 12-15mins. The main loading for 70 is between Blk 965 (one stop before Buangkok Green) to Serangoon Station. Here, if a bus stops for 2 mins at Blk 953 or Greenhaven Academy, the potential is to have a DD with 110pax</p>

              <p>the peak load point for 70B is likely to be at Yio Chu Kang Rd (Opp Seletar Hills Estate), and the remainder of the route to help 43.</p>
              <p>70B helps to clear ppl at the stop above so that people further down the route can board 70 easier.</p>

              <p>As a resident in Seletar Hills Estate, I strongly welcome the introduction of service 70B. The amount of load from this area may not be as heavy as the densely-populated urban centres like Serangoon where it would supplement as well, but it is still significant enough for an extra service to be introduced to help supplement the frequency of service 70.</p>
              <p>However, one key gripe with the introduction of 70B would be the time - it would be better if it were started at about 0600hrs instead.</p>

              <p><br>True. Residents would prefer taking 70 to 103, as 103 goes via Boundary road to Upper Serangoon road, which is an additional 4 traffic lights (quite long ones) to enter the Serangoon interchange. Even otherwise, people have to get down on the opposite side and crossover which is not the best.</p>
              <p>In evening peak though, you will see a queue at Serangoon Interchange, where some people might prefer to use 103 at the interchange than wait at the stop on Serangoon Central. Even yet, I think the loading at 103 is between 50 - 70 pax during peak loading, around 30 pax otherwise.</p>

              True. Residents would prefer taking 70 to 103, as 103 goes via
              Boundary road to Upper Serangoon road, which is an
              additional 4 traffic lights (quite long ones) to enter the
              Serangoon interchange. Even otherwise, people have to get down on
              the opposite side and crossover which is not the best.</p>
              <p>In evening peak though, you will see a queue at Serangoon
              Interchange, where some people might prefer to use 103 at the
              interchange than wait at the stop on Serangoon Central. Even yet, I
              think the loading at 103 is between 50 - 70 pax during peak
              loading, around 30 pax otherwise.</p>

              <p>Not so if they're transferring to NEL or 107. That's why we built that additional bus stop 62189 next to Exit D.</p>

              <p>I guess for 70, SBST will reduce the frequency at YCK Int. Now during the morning peak, a bus leaves the interchange every 05-08 mins. 2 buses might be taken out to 70B, which I think is fine considering the main loading is the route of 70B. So this way the frequency on 70 would be 09-10mins and that on Serenity - NEX route would be 05-07 mins.</p>
