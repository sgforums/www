I agree!  The Scanias, Mercs, M.A.Ns, UD's and the Leylands are the most reliable buses.  The old Volvo B57's were also very reliable.  Throw in a few computer gadgetry, and a few other fancy stuff, and you get an increased margin for error, and hence, a greater chance of breakdowns and failures.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SBS9818A:<br><strong><br><br>Well, if Windy were to set up a bus manufacturing company, IMO he would be [b]MORE STRINGENT</strong> than Volvo, making sure the buses do not <strong>BREAK DOWN</strong> or <strong>SCREW UP</strong> within a month of deployment![/b]</blockquote>Yeah, unlike our mates at SBST who see themselves fit to tinker around with the chassis, bringing down a good quality chassis, to a hulk of scrap metal moving along the roads at a snail's pace.<br><br>Enjoy!!</div>
