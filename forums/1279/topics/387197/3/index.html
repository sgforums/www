              Junction Drill means BC must slow down at junction. Defensive driving.
              
              Loose running time takes into account buffer for traffic incidents....... whereas tight running time can cause drivers to run late due to minimum breaks for drivers before turning back at an interchange or terminal. Drivers will come under more stress to drive quickly and might not get enough rest.

              <p>Lol. There are clutches within the gearbox. However, the main connection between the engine and the gears isnt the clutch like the manual gearbox, but rather, the torque converter. And its impossible to stall an auto vehicle unless the gearbox is gone case. The solenoid/mechanical valves will downshift in a manner that the engine's rpm is ALWAYS higher than the output speed. Even if the output speed is higher than the engine's rpm, the engine will not stall.</p>
              <p><br>Lets take this for example: A fan(A) blowing a max speed at about 1800rpm against some fan blades(B). The B started moving and spins at 1600rpm(due to power loss, their speed will NEVER be the same). However B is attached to this high speed motor. Now B is turned by the motor at 2000rpm, however, A remains at 1800rpm. I dont know how to explain this physics and mechanics behind these, but its nearly impossible to stall an auto vehicle.</p>
              <p>Another scenario is , vehicle's tire loss traction and gained traction suddenly. In a manual vehicle this normally leads to a engine stall. My cousin last time park car in carpark encountered this situation, and his engine ALWAYS stall, due to drivetrain system shock when the tires gained traction suddenly, which the engine isnt designed to withstand. Try taking a VO3x on svc 25, 22, etc. when they enter AMK Int on a wet day.</p>
              <p>There this row of steel gratings on the road which becomes extremely slippery when wet. So whenever it rains and the VO3x slowly enter, the bus will stall abit when the driving wheels went over these gratings as the tires spin uncontrollably. However when the tire hits the concrete surface the tire is forced to slow down to normal speed ALMOST instantenously. In a manual vehicle this would have stalled the engine. However, in a VO3x, theres a strong rattling coming from the engine and drivetrain, which i know it suffered some shock within the system.</p>

              <p>The lock-up clutch connects the gearbox and axle when the bus gets up to speed.</p>
              <p>This way saves fuel and cuts efficiency loss of the torque converter to zero upon connection.</p>
              <p>Ever heard of the VOs or MKIVs whose lock-up clutch has been disabled? That's what you were referring to. Utterly horrible to listen to. And no...its not 1800 and 1600, the difference is really more in the range of 2100 and 1700 for VOs.</p>
              <p>Yes. You can stall the auto bus if the clutch doesnt react to road conditions fast enough. I've experienced that on emergency brakings for buses twice already.</p>
              <p>The VOs at AMK won't stall bcos by default, the clutch for the ZF4 usually disengages rather early, unlike the later generation gearboxes which emphasise engine braking, the application of which is only possible because of the presence of the clutch. You can't do that with a torque converter only auto vehicle. Personally I don't like the use of engine braking for the new buses, they make for jerky and noisy rides, especially for the already jerky K230UBs, but they reduce the reliance on contact braking, together with the retarder. But I'm also pretty sure we'll be seeing higher incidences of worn-out clutches, so that should negate the advantages somewhat.</p>

              <p>I think even if their service is lousy or the SL had made u injured due to overbraking etc (Any unpleasant incident in SMRT), this is not the right way to say. I am not saying that bus company is 100% the best or correct but, neither is this an apporpirate way to say things.</p>

              <p>I do understand that there's no 100%.  But eversince they took over the bus services in the area I'm staying, I've encountered numerous bad experiences them.  I'm also not the only one who feels it this way.</p>
              <p>To nenepokey...this is just my opinion....i'm not talkin cock here or stirring up trouble.  I agree with you wholeheartedly.  Me alone, there's nothing much I can do vs a big organization.  However, the numerous experiences that I've gone through is really frustrating.  I've sent them feedback on the same problems but sadly, it still exists.  I do understand that there's no perfection but they ought to brush up their service and not merely paying lip service.</p>
              <p>To SMB66X - I apologise if my choice of words is overly strong, but this is merely my opinion.</p>

              <p>Being a multi-modal transport co that means they Lan Lan have to run Bus and Taxi operation set by Govt.Ditto for SBST they have to run rail services also.Both co set priority to their main bussiness ie Train and buses.Both are not perfect either,Cant discuss here though.It will invite more flame wars..</p>
