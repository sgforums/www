            <div class='col-md body'><p>Having worked as a BC / SL for SBST &amp; SMRTB respectively here's my honest opinion.Yes i fully agreed that SBST bus service are slow but not all of them.About 25% of the services especially 27,34,168 run on a bit tighter schedule due to less break time at direction 2 Interchange.So the BC must have at least 3-5 mins earlier upon reaching so that he got ample time to park and rest.Secondly about competition.If 965 can take you from WRI to Punggol in less than 32mins why bother to take 161 which take 40 mins?So the gap has to be minimal.Take note that SBST has large fleet of buses as it is the main Public bus operator while SMRTB is just like small group of public bus operator.Their main bussiness is still Trains.I have to admit that many SBST BCs crawl until a lot of complains were send to HQ.SMRTB schedule are tight,Yes trust me i've even whack 70kmh at TPE driving 969 on my second last trip to WRI due to heavy passenger loading at TMP.Most of all the driver judgement,skills,alertness and braking is the factor.So far i've not received any complains while i was over the limit.Some pax even commend me for reaching their destination on time or not faster.So in conclusion i feel there are reasons for all this.SBST got many buses so no point for them to rush like mad when the freq is good while SMRTB have to run a bit faster just to perform the freq.Remember 3000 buses versus 850 buses.No point saying who is good nor bad.Both got their advantages.We as a commuter should be grateful.</p></div>

              <p>this reminds me. i ever took one 190 before and i was in front (a lot of pax). the speedometer read 90 km/h on the PIE (towards CCK). &lt;3</p>
              <p>but sometimes the SL no choice. i ever took a 302 and some old auntie was complaining "why so fast and so jerky" (it was a smiley bendy) den the SL was like "the schedule v tight, i also don't want to chiong". FOR A FEEDER SERVICE! haha.</p>
              <p>but I think the Merc O405 are in quite pristine condition! Considering they are the main fleet and by right supposed to be lao pok...</p>
              <p>SBS Transit used to be famous for their seats having no leg room (think of the B10M MK IIs). hated it when I was a student (I always had to bend my knees / sit slanted).</p>
              <p>kinda miss them now =(</p>

              <p>i was on 8272E that day, after a long period of not riding any buses. and i noticed a huge difference between now and when the scanias were first delivered. when driven normally, the acceleration was pathetic. when pushed hard (bc was flooring the accelerator along yck rd), the acceleration doesn't seem to get any better.</p>
              <p>notice how the buses start to feel shitty after just one year.</p>

              <p>Hi Bus Fans,</p>
              <p>I would like to have your opinions with regards to the
                                      following:</p>
              <p>Personally, I find that SBS bus drivers are damn slow drivers as
                                      compared to SMRT bus drivers. Some SBS drivers can be found driving
                                      at a speed of 40km/h, whereas most SMRT bus drivers are actually
                                      driving quite fast, I would say at least 60-70km/h. I would like to
                                      know why is this so.</p>
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I beg to differ. If you have taken 22 or 24, you should know how fast they zoom. That was my experience.</span><br>
              <p>Secondly, I do not understand why is there a need for the SBS
                                      bus drivers to purposely slow down until almost to a halt at almost
                                      every red light junction especially when it is obvious that its not
                                      going to change to red anytime soon (because the opp green man is
                                      not even flashing). SMRT bus drivers will usually bo hiew and drive
                                      thru, whereas th SBS drivers like to slow down at every
                                      junction.</p>
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I do agree on this. But then again, some taxi drivers do slow down at red light junctions too. Obviously this is for safety reasons. BUT, on another note, I have experienced bus drivers that dashed red lights(specifically svc 82)</span><br>
              <p>Also, SBS drivers like to enter each and every bus stop, when
                                      its obvious that there is either no body at the bus stop or there
                                      is no one flagging for the bus to stop. SMRT drivers on the other
                                      hand, would not enter the bus stops unneccessarily.</p>
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I suppose they have a schedule to follow. If they are way too ahead of their schedule, they might be pinalized or something...I'm not too sure.</span><br>

              <p>The first acceleration is not at normal operation, kickdown is obviously activated and fuel consumption would shoot up in such a scenario.</p>
              <p>New generation of buses focus on low emissions and fuel consumption, while this is the focus, engine rpms are to remain at a low range. Sad for power enthusiasts (I am one of them), but this is the case. Any engine rpm above 1500 would generally mean dirty emission and high fuel consumption, for these engines.</p>
              <p>Now, an OC can do that without activating kickdown.</p>

              <p>this reminds me. i ever took one 190 before and i was in front
              (a lot of pax). the speedometer read 90 km/h on the PIE (towards
              CCK). &lt;3</p>
              <p>but sometimes the SL no choice. i ever took a 302 and some old
              auntie was complaining "why so fast and so jerky" (it was a smiley
              bendy) den the SL was like "the schedule v tight, i also don't want
              to chiong". FOR A FEEDER SERVICE! haha.</p>
              <p>but I think the Merc O405 are in quite pristine condition!

              <p>SBS Transit used to be famous for their seats having no leg room
              (think of the B10M MK IIs). hated it when I was a student (I always

              <p>Hi Bus Fans,</p>
              <p>I would like to have your opinions with regards to the
              following:</p>
              <p>Personally, I find that SBS bus drivers are damn slow drivers as
              compared to SMRT bus drivers. Some SBS drivers can be found driving
              at a speed of 40km/h, whereas most SMRT bus drivers are actually
              driving quite fast, I would say at least 60-70km/h. I would like to
              know why is this so.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Generally true, but exceptions are. some SBST services can choing very fast, i got 60 kph full ride speed before........</span></p>
              <p>Secondly, I do not understand why is there a need for the SBS
              bus drivers to purposely slow down until almost to a halt at almost
              every red light junction especially when it is obvious that its not
              going to change to red anytime soon (because the opp green man is
              not even flashing). SMRT bus drivers will usually bo hiew and drive
              thru, whereas th SBS drivers like to slow down at every
              junction.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Company policy. 5- 15 -30 rule, 5 kph in bus bay, 15 kph when approaching BS, 30 kph at junction</span></p>
              <p>Also, SBS drivers like to enter each and every bus stop, when
              its obvious that there is either no body at the bus stop or there
              is no one flagging for the bus to stop. SMRT drivers on the other
              hand, would not enter the bus stops unneccessarily.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Too much time</span></p>
              <p>The only good thing about SBS buses is that their bus frequency
              are better than SMRT, other than that, SMRT wins hands down.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lesser bus, service 190 quite punctual</span></p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to share with you guys my experience... On
              this particular day, I was going to McRitchie Reservoir. I could
              have taken 93 or 855. SBS 93 came first, but I did not board it. I
              waited around 5 minutes later and SMRT 855 came. Therefore, 93 had
              a so called 5 minutes head start. Then it was just after farrer,
              the 855 caught up with the 93. And then the ultimate stunt came!!
              The bus 93 went into an empty bus stop. It was obvious no one was
              alighting (I can see clearly) and no one was boarding (I can see
              that too). Then the SBS bus driver pulled his hand out from his
              window and signalled the SMRT 855 to please move ahead!!!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Service 25 v 854</span></p>
              <p>This tells me how slow can SBS drivers be. Fancy stopping just
              to let the buses behind him to go ahead first. If I was on that bus
              93, I would definitely have been pissed off to the max.</p>
              <p>Anyway, when I reach my destination, I turned back and I saw
              absolutely no trace of that bus 93!!</p>

              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I beg to differ. If you have taken 22 or 24, you should know how fast they zoom. That was my experience.</span><br>
              <p>Secondly, I do not understand why is there a need for the SBS bus drivers to purposely slow down until almost to a halt at almost every red light junction especially when it is obvious that its not going to change to red anytime soon (because the opp green man is not even flashing). SMRT bus drivers will usually bo hiew and drive thru, whereas th SBS drivers like to slow down at every junction.</p>
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I do agree on this. But then again, some taxi drivers do slow down at red light junctions too. Obviously this is for safety reasons. BUT, on another note, I have experienced bus drivers that dashed red lights(specifically svc 82)</span><br>
              <p>Also, SBS drivers like to enter each and every bus stop, when its obvious that there is either no body at the bus stop or there is no one flagging for the bus to stop. SMRT drivers on the other hand, would not enter the bus stops unneccessarily.</p>
              <span style="color: #3366ff;">I suppose they have a schedule to follow. If they are way too ahead of their schedule, they might be pinalized or something...I'm not too sure.</span><br>
