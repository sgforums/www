              <p>Hi Bus Fans,</p>
              <p>I would like to have your opinions with regards to the following:</p>
              <p>Personally, I find that SBS bus drivers are damn slow drivers as compared to SMRT bus drivers. Some SBS drivers can be found driving at a speed of 40km/h, whereas most SMRT bus drivers are actually driving quite fast, I would say at least 60-70km/h. I would like to know why is this so.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I do not understand why is there a need for the SBS bus drivers to purposely slow down until almost to a halt at almost every red light junction especially when it is obvious that its not going to change to red anytime soon (because the opp green man is not even flashing). SMRT bus drivers will usually bo hiew and drive thru, whereas th SBS drivers like to slow down at every junction.</p>
              <p>Also, SBS drivers like to enter each and every bus stop, when its obvious that there is either no body at the bus stop or there is no one flagging for the bus to stop. SMRT drivers on the other hand, would not enter the bus stops unneccessarily.</p>
              <p>The only good thing about SBS buses is that their bus frequency are better than SMRT, other than that, SMRT wins hands down.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to share with you guys my experience... On this particular day, I was going to McRitchie Reservoir. I could have taken 93 or 855. SBS 93 came first, but I did not board it. I waited around 5 minutes later and SMRT 855 came. Therefore, 93 had a so called 5 minutes head start. Then it was just after farrer, the 855 caught up with the 93. And then the ultimate stunt came!! The bus 93 went into an empty bus stop. It was obvious no one was alighting (I can see clearly) and no one was boarding (I can see that too). Then the SBS bus driver pulled his hand out from his window and signalled the SMRT 855 to please move ahead!!!</p>
              <p>This tells me how slow can SBS drivers be. Fancy stopping just to let the buses behind him to go ahead first. If I was on that bus 93, I would definitely have been pissed off to the max.</p>
              <p>Anyway, when I reach my destination, I turned back and I saw absolutely no trace of that bus 93!!</p>

              <p>To ensure safety on the road. Took TIB742A on 187 today. the male BC slowed down at the Woodlands Ave 3 red light junction as he knew the traffic light was starting to turn red.</p>

              <p>1. For me, OC versus Merczs. On 22th December I boarded TIB426M on 852 home from YCK. The bus before TIB426M is SMB94P (on perm 851) But when TIB425R reached Marymount Road, it started to chiong (there is no people alight at that stop) whereas SMB94P needed to stop at there and let people board and alight. It chionged in the maximum speed in order to pass the red-light junction between Marymount Road and Marymount Lane before it turned red. After TIB426M managed to pass the traffic light, I turned back and looked: I could not spot SMB94P at Marymount Road.</p>
              <p>2. Anyway, it is usual for 852 to overtake 157 at night while travelling on Lornie Road (Towards Farrer Road direction) When 852 reached last Bukit Batok bus-stop, I had to wait for around 5 minutes for 157 to come and go home.</p>
              <p>To conclude for 1) the BC who drove TIB426M on 852 chionged all the journey, as if it was lambated for around 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

              <p><br>Yes. If the schedule is tight, the SLs or BCs will have to rush throughout the entire journey. That is also why most of the time you see SMRTB SLs rushing around most of the time because SMRTB's schedules are more tighter than SBST's schedules. </p>
              <p>Next time if you see a SMRT/SBST bus rushing down a road, please try to think in an alternative way. While safety is an important factor, the SL/BC is trying his/her best to do their job well. Unless it gets really reckless, we have nothing that we can do but have to trust on the drivers skills, for they have been driving the same route and know the road's traffic conditions much better than anyone of us. And also take into account how demanding their job can be (e.g. sitting in the bus at full concentration at all times, stress caused by other motorists on the road etc.). In other words its not easy for them as well ... ...</p>

              <p>I prefer SBS. SMRT buses, especially the O405s, are in such bad condition. I took TIB 758E sometime ago and to my horror, I found a seat which was broken at 2 ends. Also, SBS introduces K230UBs, which is way better than the OC500LEs as they are much more quieter. SBS uses double decker buses, which occupies less space on the road then the articulated buses that SMRT uses. SMRT also bought China made buses. In addition, SBS uses all their new buses to Changi Airport while SMRT uses O405s. Tourists will definitely have a better impression on SBS.</p>

              <p>Hi Bus Fans,</p>
              <p>I would like to have your opinions with regards to the following:</p>
              <p>Personally, I find that SBS bus drivers are damn slow drivers as compared to SMRT bus drivers. Some SBS drivers can be found driving at a speed of 40km/h, whereas most SMRT bus drivers are actually driving quite fast, I would say at least 60-70km/h. I would like to know why is this so.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I do not understand why is there a need for the SBS bus drivers to purposely slow down until almost to a halt at almost every red light junction especially when it is obvious that its not going to change to red anytime soon (because the opp green man is not even flashing). SMRT bus drivers will usually bo hiew and drive thru, whereas th SBS drivers like to slow down at every junction.</p>
              <p>Also, SBS drivers like to enter each and every bus stop, when its obvious that there is either no body at the bus stop or there is no one flagging for the bus to stop. SMRT drivers on the other hand, would not enter the bus stops unneccessarily.</p>
              <p>The only good thing about SBS buses is that their bus frequency are better than SMRT, other than that, SMRT wins hands down.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to share with you guys my experience... On this particular day, I was going to McRitchie Reservoir. I could have taken 93 or 855. SBS 93 came first, but I did not board it. I waited around 5 minutes later and SMRT 855 came. Therefore, 93 had a so called 5 minutes head start. Then it was just after farrer, the 855 caught up with the 93. And then the ultimate stunt came!! The bus 93 went into an empty bus stop. It was obvious no one was alighting (I can see clearly) and no one was boarding (I can see that too). Then the SBS bus driver pulled his hand out from his window and signalled the SMRT 855 to please move ahead!!!</p>
              <p>This tells me how slow can SBS drivers be. Fancy stopping just to let the buses behind him to go ahead first. If I was on that bus 93, I would definitely have been pissed off to the max.</p>
              <p>Anyway, when I reach my destination, I turned back and I saw absolutely no trace of that bus 93!!</p>

              <p><br>I agree to the point. Find that the seats of the Merc 0405s have very little cushion and my butt tends to ache after a long journey. Also those furry seats attract too much dust already, they ought to be replaced.</p>
              <p>I would say that the seats for the newer WAB buses for SBST and SMRT are about the same.</p>
