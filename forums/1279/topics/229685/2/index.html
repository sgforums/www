Obviously you dont like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Actually i also agree with you initially, why buy the K124IB in the first place when it isn't wheelchair friendly and is used mainly for intercity services. And also, the Opticruise is 12-speed, and is a waste when installed on a city bus. 6-speed already got people say wasteful. Manual you dont even have to say, its not useful when used for city buses, because since the constant stopping and moving off experienced by city buses will cause the clutch to wear out very quickly, which is a reason why city buses uses auto gearboxes and some garbage trucks also use it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
