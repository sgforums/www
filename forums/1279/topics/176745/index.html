And for the 3 days during morning peak near south buona vista road, they were bendies and having less than 15 on board.<br><br>And on most days, I had to wait for more than 15 minutes, my rotten luck? Anyway it took me 15 minutes to walk to AYE, and I believe in future I would walk to AYE to take SBST198. In fact some of my colleagues doing the same thing too.<br><br></div>
