There is no legal reason for him to refuse your coins as long as you have shown your card.<br><br>Cash payment is a legitimate form of payment for public transport. Stand up for your rights. The quality of service and manners of our BCs are going to the pits, with rude drivers and abusive behavior becoming very common. Sometimes, I wonder if they get an orgasmic thrill out of going that far beyond their duty scope to perform a narcissistic witchhunt on a commuter when it has been proven and witnessed that the commuter was in the right.<br><br>If Singaporeans do not stand up to abusive BCs, then they deserve the crap that is being doled out to them.<br><br>I have had a BC who had the nerve to pick an argument with him when I gave him a tongue-lashing when he stopped his bus frequently along the road and in the middle of a traffic junction and used language that was frankly verbal outrage of modesty, on a middle aged lady, asking to do a body search on her without reasonable proof other than his wild yelling and swearing.</div>

Ideally, thats supposed to be the case. However, the BC might not be cooperative enuff to cancel your trip. So you need to go thru the tedious process of complaining and claiming and things like that. Hence, to be on the safe side, I rather NOT tap on the ezlink card reader.</div>

They are super rude, for example one BC on 143 (SBS 9819 Y)   However, those Service 65 BC's are polite [majority](More on the AR Side). Rarely do i see they check ez-link card and can answer passengers questions when asked. </div></blockquote>hmm... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> well, i hvae been approached by some 147 &amp; 156 bus drivers before, and they are certainly not from AMDEP/BRAM. So i guess you cant just generalise that those BC's that check cards are from BRAM/AMDEP.<br><br>Do you know why those bcs have such atrocious attitude? This is because they were successful in their attempts to squeeze money from those innocent paxs and somehow or other, they can just derive joy from it.  So, to curb such a problem, you should never let the BCs "win", so long as reason is on your side, so that they will think twice before they pick up trouble again. Dont let them get what they want, then feel very sore over it, thats doing disservice to yourself.</div>
