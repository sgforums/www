            <div class='col-md body'>I happen to read this article on Lian He Wan Bao few days ago and saw SBST reply to this reader after like 3 weeks.<br><br>Background:<br><br>The reader wrote in to request for more aircon buses on service 74.<br><br>Reply (Part 1):<br>SBST replied saying that they would consider adding more aircon buses into service 74's fleet.<br><br>Reply (Part 2):<br>The reply ended by saying as the demands of aircon buses has risen over the years, the buses that are accquired now are all aircon buses.<br><br>With regards on part 2, I was wonder what has this got to do with the request of the person who wrote in. Yes, so what if they accquire all the aircon buses in the world but not confirm adding in more aircon buses for the requested service (i.e. service 74)???</div>
