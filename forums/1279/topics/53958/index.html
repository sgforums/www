This may sound like kind of subversion, but my experience stems from at least 200 km travelled per week, and more than at least 7 hours in the bus, and of which a minimum of 60% logged during the morning peak. And I have taken TIB1003 to TIB1016, with the exception  of TIB1002.</div></blockquote>I never say I take Sv. 851 back home right? I said any service from Cat High in general.</div>
