              <p>cyclists shouldn't cycle on pavement. the careless ones can cause injury to those who walk.</p>
              <p>i cycle on a regular basis. i must say most sbs drivers are cool. perhaps they are trained. most actually filter out to pass me and my group of cyclists. on our part, we keep to our line as much as possible. we do not weave in and out but be as predictible as possible. of course, we keep ourselves well `lighted' up. we cycle mostly at night weekdays, doing the mandai - new tee loop.</p>
              <p>16/f/lonely is correct. there has to be mutual respect for all road users, regardless of vehicle type one uses. when i drive, i try to give way to cyclists/motorcyclists as much as possible when the situation calls.</p>
              <p>for a life to be lost due to an impatient driver would be tragic.</p>
              <p>having said that, singapore has a long way to go to being a cycle friendly nation. perhaps it is the humid weather....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i cycle on the roads too.<br><br>it's impossible to cycle on the pathways.<br><br>just look at the park connector, bicycle track, under the MRT viaduct between Tampines &amp; Simei stations, pedestrians are on the bicycle track just so they are away from the Sun. granted they want shade, who will be at fault for "causing the inconvenience"?<br><br>i cycle up loyang ave towards changi village. at the uphill part when the bus driver filters out from bus stop, they give way to me but i'll always check behind to see if it's clear for him. if it is, i'll rather wave and let him go ahead. slow me cant accelerate up the steep loyang avenue. :)<br><br>cycling in CBD is also not a problem. my experience, bus drivers will give a bit of leeway.. but i havent done much cycling along shenton way since the full day bus lanes kicked in...<br><br>i'm more towards thinking that the cyclists in the article are those "professional" cyclists with racing bikes that take up the entire lane when they cycle, especially so with their friends in tow.</p></div>
