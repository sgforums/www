            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, i wudnt want the proposed CT38. if you see clearly, these CT services only ply mature estates where there are more of the older adults (more than 40yrs old) who would go to Chinatown regularly. these "older adults" wouldnt want to go to the usual Tampines Mall or Junction 8 to shop. they would rather do so at the heart of Chinatown itself. and this is what makes CT 8, 18 and 28 have pretty good loads over the weekends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

IMO, there is a bigger need for CT Services to serve Boon Lay/Jurong East.<br><br>CT28 should REALLY be extended to Boon Lay as the current route to Clementi is only a waste of $$$ and resource. The loads of CT28 are very poor. I belief that CT28 would have good loads like CT8/18 if it was extended.</div>
