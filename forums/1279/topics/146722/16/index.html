Besides the customer service hotline should be closed during the weekend.  Besides, the cust svc hotline may not have enough information to provide you with.  Please wait for the official press release be up at ALL the bus stops.  I believe they will be up by Monday or latest Tuesday.  So kindly be patient and by then you will have all the route details.</div>

Of course we get "enthusiastic" about such things.

Reacting over-excitedly doesn't reflect your enthusiasm, rather it reflects childishness and stupidity.<br></div>
