            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely SBST....esp after how SMRT had pissed me off severely with their frequency and their operations these years, while SBST had pleased me with their deployment of alternative services that I take.<br><br>Also, I personally find that SBST drivers are more skilled in their handling of the bus and much less reckless than SMRT drivers ( my heart went up to my mouth when the driver on 0938 almost ploughed the bus into a traffic pole at 50kmh today... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ). They are also less likely and tempted to 'choke' the bus than SMRT drivers. ( ie stepping up the accelerator and releasing it to kick down the gear right after the gear had moved up, producing heck lots of impulse that jerks the bus back )</div>

SMRT is a company, only thinking about money and extremely low-class service. Despite the fact that many lives were taken in the jumping-into-the-railway incident, they just did nothing. Furthermore, a glance at the SMRT website will give people the first impression that how rundown SMRT is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i will prefer SMRT den SBST.. SMRT bus captains seems to be more friendly and courteous den SBST i supposed, cos for every ride tat i took for SMRT, i see bus captains signaling/communicating with each other from a distance when they passes thru each other as i dun think SBST bus captains will do tat bahz.. Besides, SMRT buses are quite well maintained, even the old Nissan Diesel U31RCNs were well maintained..  I took SMRT Buses most of the time since i've moved to Bukit Panjang in 1997 when SBS(now SBST) was about to hand over Bukit Panjang Bus Terminal(now as Interchange) to TIBS(now SMRT).. and SMRT now even equipped fully with AC Buses rather den SBST(I understand tat SBST has so many NAC buses to be converted and i can't just expect SBST to be like SMRT to convert all NAC Buses to AC Buses, by the time maybe SBST even scrapped or withdrawn all NAC buses by then maybe after 5 yrs? 10 yrs?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
