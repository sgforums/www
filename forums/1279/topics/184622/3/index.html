Imagine my surprise when I saw folks at PSR Dr 12 flagging the bus down with 9632T in the background (rear hatch open).<br><br>Also, this would be the 3rd time 9632T has broken down since last year. The first time, bus broke down at AMK, 2nd time, at PSR Int, apparently refused to start from parking lot. Coincidentally again, at that time 3607G was sitting 20m away with smoke billowing from the rear, and a worried BC was using an extinguisher to put out the flames. 9632T is problematic, 3 years ago, I took it and it refused to close rear door at HG, dunno what's wrong with it.</div>
