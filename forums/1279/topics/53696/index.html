            <div class='col-md body'>On Monday 7 July 2003 morning 8am++, I witnessed a commotion on bus 76 as I was on board that bus enroute to work. The Crowd is tremendous and the bus driver had stand up and shout "Oei, pls move back!!!" as there are lots of "statues" in the bus who refused to budge. There was an old lady who clinged on to the pole tightly which was near to the front door. She "zapped" her e-zlink card(Cash card for paying the bus fares) and there was a "de de de" meaning error. Then she zapped again. Error. Then the young 20+ male bus driver told her to zapped again. ERROR. Then the old lady said that she has enough money, how come there's an error. Then the bus driver told the old granny whether she had zapped the card or not and she said she did. The old lady patiently zapped again and again. There is another man seated 2 rows in front of me at the left hand side on the seat advised the old lady not to zapped again as it will double charged or start a new journay<br>fare again.<br><br>Then the old lady snapped back in mandarin and refuted the driver(very long)<br><br>"Which eyes did you see me that I did not zapped the card. Don't<br>anyhow say ok? You did not see my zapped the card and said that I did not zapped the card. Don't think that I'm dressed like that I don't have money. Not every Singaporeans who dressed expensively have money. Those who dressed raggedly have the most money. People so eager to kidnapped me for ransom ok! My sons and daughters are university graduates. You despised me is it because I dressed so simply is it? You look down on me because I don't have much education is it? I have lots of cars at home. My sons and daughters are selling cars. You young people don't anyhow say ok? I will call people to beat you up. You want to one on one is it? You come down from your driver seat and we go to one side and fight it out................"<br><br>And the rattling goes on. My stop is here and I alighted from the bus. At time the bus is very crowded and how can the bus driver see whether the old lady has zapped the card? Ahysterical old lady or just a pure misunderstanding? Is the driver's fault or the illiterate old lady fault for "zappng" the card too fast?<br><br>What does this tell us?............</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a literal metaphor. Some trunk service drivers had even faced instances where for example, I was running late and a man decided to teach and scold the poor indian driver, wwho was driving a HAbit on svc 851. Well, the Indian driver was late in the first place, and went over the limit, which in my opinion, was damn good, hub reduction was super, but one pax was dozing and as a result, missed his bus stop, which was YCK MRT. He decided to stay on and scolded the bus driver like siao, using derogatory remarks like "...your father's bus ah?..." and other obscene and racist remarks that are better left unsaid. Worse of all, he is very inconsiderate, and held up for 5 minutes at the Bus bay. Those who travel frequently on svc 851 during morning peak should know the result.<br><br>The bus driver could not rebutt of course, ( Rule 101 of TIBS - Customer always right,even guys who threaten to blow up the bus ), and I pity him like siao. Anyway, the guy got sick of scolding and alighted 2 stops over, but stood up and lectured him at each bus stop for speeding. I am very sure that the guy is not a TIBS, SBST or LTA or PTC employee, from my instution. None of the pax spoke up, this being singapore. Luckily, the driver looked relieved when he alighted and accelerated hardly of, spraying a good amount of exhaust in the guy's face, which I think he earned it. I was not late that day due to the &gt;60kmh driving for the next few stops, and I could only hope that the guy did not write a complaint to TIBS about the driver.</div>

If the driver is stuck at home on bed rest it definitely is a case of cardiac arrest, luckily he didn't pass away, it would have been a waste.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>Back in the 1980s, I agree that many Spore bus drivers have poor driving skills and rude. But now is the opposite, poor bus drivers have to contend to rude and unreasonable passengers! Worse still, the public bus companies are ever ready to punish their drivers heavily for complaint from passengers.<br><br>Bus drivers tend to make mistakes at times because they are human-being too! Why can't some passengers be more forgiving for minor mistakes made by the drivers? They have to dutifully work long-hours, be alert at all times, work at irregular times regardless of day and night, public holidays!!<br><br>Its common knowledge that many Sporeans "siam" being a bus driver, cause of inadequate pay, long-hours and abuse from passengers that bus companies have no choice but to employ M'sians which make up 2/3 of the employees!!!<br><br>I'm a Sporean. During my current 3rd year stay in Melbourne(Australia), I realised that many Aussie passengers respect their bus drivers. It's a norm for us to greet the bus driver first when we board and say Thank You when we alight!!<br><br>what a shame in Spore...its all right if we don't go to the extent of greeting bus drivers, but we should at least appreciate their services and put ourselves in their shoes!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, I fully agree.

Well, at least some friendly bus drivers do know how to 'relieve anger' in some frustrated customers by going the extra mile to say 'Good Morning', 'Good Evening', etc.<br><br>But it only works on some people. Those staying in my Yishun Area should know what I mean, a "W S Leong" greets his commuters every morning when they board his 804/806 (Usual is TIB 1164 L). However, I've noticed that some unappreciative people either just sway past and pretend not to notice, or else cast 'high and mighty' look at him and just move to the rear.<br><br>Perhaps such behaviour is a little too unfriendly, I mean, at least, we ought to at least smile or give some kind of positive response?</div></blockquote>Is Mr W.S. Leong skinny? I've seen this skinny driver of service 806 serving route 804A the other time. He is an ex service 859 driver (then svc 859 was with AMKDEP) and he's one of my favourite driver.</div>

But now is the opposite, poor bus drivers have to contend to rude and unreasonable passengers! Worse still, the public bus companies are ever ready to punish their drivers heavily for complaint from passengers.<br><br>Bus drivers tend to make mistakes at times because they are human-being too! Why can't some passengers be more forgiving for minor mistakes made by the drivers? They have to dutifully work long-hours, be alert at all times, work at irregular times regardless of day and night, public holidays!!<br><br>Its common knowledge that many Sporeans "siam" being a bus driver, cause of inadequate pay, long-hours and abuse from passengers that bus companies have no choice but to employ M'sians which make up 2/3 of the employees!!!<br><br>I'm a Sporean. During my current 3rd year stay in Melbourne(Australia), I realised that many Aussie passengers respect their bus drivers. It's a norm for us to greet the bus driver first when we board and say Thank You when we alight!!<br><br>what a shame in Spore...its all right if we don't go to the extent of greeting bus drivers, but we should at least appreciate their services and put ourselves in their shoes!! </div></blockquote>True. The roles have been reserved. Wait till the passengers experience how it is like to be a bus driver, and see if they still are unreasonable. I must agree that many bus drivers are Malaysians.</div>
