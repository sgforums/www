If you are one of the few few batches of people going out of the stadium, you should have no problem boarding the stadium direct. The stadium Direct is more or less on a Demand based service. The more demand you have, the more runs the service you will find. If not, usually there will be only 1 run for the night after the event.</div>

Its evident that they're working on it, even amdep finally gives in in deploying doubledeckers for her stadiumdirect on such a major occasion. of course i do agree that more can be done to further improve it. after saying so much, my main point is that one should direct one's complaints and feedback directly to sbs crc to see the actions being carried out.</div>

The Max Capacity for National Stadium is only 55,000. From what i see, it was only 3/4 Full. Talking about SIngapore Indoor Stadium next door, since there was a concert going on, the MAX number of ppl there would at most be 8,000. Again, i doubt that it was filled to the brim of 8,000 people. Do your maths. How could it ever be reached to the number of 70,000 people in that area as claimed by you ? Would you be kind enough to explain. ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stadium direct is operated based on demand<br><br>the buses will lie in wait or the folks to stream out. usually got TI armed with walkie monitors situations on ground. once a huge crowd has gathered at the indoor stadium bus stop  other TIs will suddenly have laminated paper  like signbaords n start waving etc.<br><br>by then some 4 BCs will have driven their first STD buses over. Got Bedok,AMK,BNLand tampines ones. usually they prepare only two buses per service.<br><br>the 4 buses will line up at the bus stop and TI will start waving/yelling pp linto right bus using the signs.once a bus is filled to the door and sardine packed. TI will signal driver to move off. (it is possible that both buses were filled up by the time u got there and both went off liao)<br><br>incidentally last i took, each STD dir has a SS1 to SS4 service no. printed on ticket<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>
