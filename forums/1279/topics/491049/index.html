                  <p>In a confessions page, the administrators would usually interact with the participants and respond to confessions.</p>
                  <p>It would be good if FrenchFries, Tomato and the other moderators can actively participate in this thread.</p>
               <p>This thread can be a platform for the forum moderators to engage with the forum users. It can help to create new bonds and strengthen existing bonds, among the users and the moderators.</p>

              <p>If you didn't notice, the confession pages on Facebook and Twitter (?) are moderated by one person (or small committee), with submitted anonymous entries. </p>
              <p>We don't really have that here, all posts are logged to our accounts, and pretty many of us may know each other in some way offline / in real life. This decreases the willingness for us to share some of our so-called secrets, or "confessions".</p>
              <p>FireIce said she wouldn't want to operate such a "Confessions" thread. Tamago isn't frequently online. If we were to nominate someone else from the forum to manage submission entries, there may be trust issues involved.</p>
              <p>This is just my own comment on your initiative. I am neither in favour of nor against it.</p>
