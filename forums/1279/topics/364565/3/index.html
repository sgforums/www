Having boarded the bus at 7.50pm, it arrived at my destination at 8.55pm. The normal travelling time is 45mins but it took 1 hour 5mins on this day.

The penalty fine of a few thousands each quarter hardly deter bus operators at all. On the other hard, it makes the governance of our public transport a laughing stock.<br><br>With the looming H1N1 threat, can we afford public transportation to be overly congested? Do we want to increase the stress of living in Singapore with bad public transportation? We are currently promoting Singapore to be a city of the future and to attract people from around the world to live here. I heard that elections maybe coming soon and there maybe job rotation in the Transport Minister position. But please do ensure that the objectives which was set out 2 years ago are met. Public transportation is what millions of commuters in Singapore has to undertake each day.</p>

              <p>Complaints by public can be taken as feedbacks by the bus companies.</p>
              <p>As for the fares, It also revolves around the world's economy. If they don't raise the fares when needed they will be making losses and won't be able to run the transport company. FYI SBST and SMRT are not running the bus routes for free.</p>

              hardly deter bus operators at all. On the other hard, it makes the
              governance of our public transport a laughing stock.<br> <br> With the looming H1N1 threat, can we afford public transportation
              to be overly congested? Do we want to increase the stress of living
              in Singapore with bad public transportation? We are currently
              promoting Singapore to be a city of the future and to attract
              people from around the world to live here. I heard that elections
              maybe coming soon and there maybe job rotation in the Transport
              Minister position. But please do ensure that the objectives which
              was set out 2 years ago are met. Public transportation is what
              millions of commuters in Singapore has to undertake each day.</p>

              <p>You don't expect the transport system in Singapore to reach your expectations so quickly. You should actually be already satisfied as compared to other countries which have a more inefficient transport system. Having a waiting time of 22 mins is just coincidental and thus, happens only once a while. We have an average waiting time of 10-15 mins and that's considered quite remarkable as our transport system has improved since the last few decades.Your appointment was just a coincidence and that is so happened that the bus did not arrive on time. These only happen occasionally. You should be more flexible about these things.</p>

              <p>Public transport has come a long way in Singapore alredy.</p>
              <p>When pple complain, is it because they have come to expect so much more? Back in those days when there was no MRT, no 12 min bus frequency, no Iris and lack of connectivity, how did those pple get by? Did they also go the route of private transport?</p>
              <p>For the 99% of the time that we get to our destinations safely and on time, do we show our appreciation? Yes, it can be damn frustrating when the wait for the bus is long and when the train breaks down, but at the same time, I am sure there were just as many times, if not more, when the bus/mrt comes on time. Why issit then there are only pple complaining of the lack of improvements in SG public transport?</p>

              <p><br>Rubbish, TS incident is just the ice tip of all kind of ridiculous bus arriving time. I still remember a thread abt waiting more than 45mins. So many reply, people curse and swear. I go to many forum, plenty of reply cursing stupid Sg public bus service. It not as I malign abt public bus in spore. Its a real live fact that Sg public bus is not really worth what u pay and the worry of so many people held ramsom by public transport. </p>
              <p>When u talk abt what non efficient transport system in other countries. U must remember we pay more than them for personal transport.</p>

              <p>quite sure everyone has their fair share of unhappiness toward the service standard of the buses at times. i am not saying to not complain. complaining can be a form of constructive feedback to improve certain areas.</p>
              <p>my point in my earlier posts is to say that a single shot to blast tthat there is no improvement in singapore's private transport is just unfair. like all singaporeans, if i see something not right, i also will complain mah. Just that i won't say that that there are no improvements outright. just as we complain abt the many faults, we must also recognise and appreciate the plus points of our public transport system.</p>
