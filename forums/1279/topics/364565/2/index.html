              </ul>
              <p>Fact : Some people do not wish to have/do not have their personal transport hence they rely on public transport. And yes to some even if they do own car, they hope that public transport, including buses can be their alternative to cars! For example they can take a bus for the day to save on their petrol cost, or not wanting to find a parking space in a full parking lot in the peak hours for the day. My mum always rely on buses as her mode of transport around Singapore because she st does not own a car/bike. That is why LTA is mandating improvements to the public transport.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Why cannot huh?  I find it so funny people can take taking bus as an hobby. And think Sg bus like heaven. Hahaha.. It's a joke man. In singapore, public bus is a even a greater joke!</strong><br><br>Precisely, it u bus enthusiatic that makes SBS and Tibs do a great job since they can attract people taking bus as an hobby.</li>

              <p>I sent this to our Transport Minister today. Hopefully he can
              look into it and improve our buses efficiency one day....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir,<br> <br> It has been almost 2 years since the master plan in improving our
              Singapore's public transport has been announced to the general
              public. Since then, I have been looking forward to the day that our
              buses can indeed be our real alternative to a car. Last year April,
              based on a feedback I have given to the PTC, they assured me that
              by June last year (email dated 14th April 2008), the average
              frequency of the buses will be 12mins and by August this year, it
              will be 10 mins during the peak season.<br> <br> I have been overseas the last one year and has got back to
              Singapore a few months back, looking forward to the changes that
              our public transport has undergone.<br> <br> Nevertheless, I am in for a surprise this month alone when I took
              public buses to my destination. It seems to be in the same state as
              it was 2 years back, or even 10 years ago.<br> <br> Take for example when I was on my way to work via bus service 55 on
              the 4th June (Thursday). Having boarded the bus at 7.50pm, it
              arrived at my destination at 8.55pm. The normal travelling time is
              45mins but it took 1 hour 5mins on this day. It resulted in me
              being late for work and have to receive a penalty for being
              late.<br> <br> On another occasion today, I checked out Iris next bus in ensuring
              that the waiting time at bus stop is kept to a minimal. It
              indicated that the next bus will be arriving at 6.14pm. I got to
              the bus stop at 6.10pm and started waiting. It finally arrived at
              6.32pm, with a waiting time of 22mins. I have to cancel my
              appointment in the evening as a result.<br> <br> With Singapore buses being one of the main transportation backbone
              in moving people around Singapore, it is hardly reliable for us to
              put our trust in it.<br> <br> Please allow me to also share my disappointment with Singapore's
              public transport in our local online forums. Hopefully it will
              gather enough attention for our citizens to decide whether should
              further action be done to ensure quality and checks on our buses
              are in place. The penalty fine of a few thousands each quarter
              hardly deter bus operators at all. On the other hard, it makes the
              governance of our public transport a laughing stock.<br> <br> With the looming H1N1 threat, can we afford public transportation
              to be overly congested? Do we want to increase the stress of living
              in Singapore with bad public transportation? We are currently
              promoting Singapore to be a city of the future and to attract
              people from around the world to live here. I heard that elections
              maybe coming soon and there maybe job rotation in the Transport
              Minister position. But please do ensure that the objectives which
              was set out 2 years ago are met. Public transportation is what
              millions of commuters in Singapore has to undertake each day.</p>

              <p>just my opinion..</p>
              <p>true, bike is ur own personal vehicle so u can get to anywhere wif it. but spare a thought for others who can't afford a vehicle. if everyone drives their own vehicles, there'll be congestion everywhere. i'll rather my guy to be sum1 who is familiar wif using e public transport (e.g bus hopping in getting to desired places) instead of some dumbass who knows nth and take me to e wrong places all e time.</p>

              <p>i can bet with u that almost 30% of bus fans have gf / wife. You paid for a costly bike, haha u dumbass u owe the bank $$$ while for us we take public transport everyday we pay cheap and we still get to our destination that we want and also we spend on more things that we want while you the dumbass who owe the bank $$$ have to spend wisely and thrifty.</p>
