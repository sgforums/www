              <p>I sent this to our Transport Minister today. Hopefully he can look into it and improve our buses efficiency one day....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Sir,<br><br>It has been almost 2 years since the master plan in
              improving our Singapore's public transport has been announced to the
              general public. Since then, I have been looking forward to the day that
              our buses can indeed be our real alternative to a car. Last year April,
              based on a feedback I have given to the PTC, they assured me that by
              June last year (email dated 14th April 2008), the average frequency of
              the buses will be 12mins and by August this year, it will be 10 mins
              during the peak season.<br><br>I have been overseas the last one year
              and has got back to Singapore a few months back, looking forward to the
              changes that our public transport has undergone. <br><br>Nevertheless, I am in for a surprise this month alone when I took
               public buses to my destination. It seems to be in the same state as it was 2 years back, or even 10 years ago.<br><br>Take
              for example when I was on my way to work via bus service 55 on the 4th
              June (Thursday). Having boarded the bus at 7.50pm, it arrived at my
              destination at 8.55pm. The normal travelling time is 45mins but it took
              1 hour 5mins on this day. It resulted in me being late for work and
              have to receive a penalty for being late.<br><br>On another occasion
              today, I checked out Iris next bus in ensuring that the waiting time at
              bus stop is kept to a minimal. It indicated that the next bus will be
              arriving at 6.14pm. I got to the bus stop at 6.10pm and started
              waiting. It finally arrived at 6.32pm, with a waiting time of 22mins. I
              have to cancel my appointment in the evening as a result. <br><br>With
              Singapore buses being one of the main transportation backbone in moving
              people around Singapore, it is hardly reliable for us to put our trust
              in it. <br><br>Please allow me to also share my disappointment with
              Singapore's public transport in our local online forums. Hopefully it
              will gather enough attention for our citizens to decide whether should
              further action be done to ensure quality and checks on our buses are in
              place. The penalty fine of a few thousands each quarter hardly deter
              bus operators at all. On the other hard, it makes the governance of our
              public transport a laughing stock.<br><br>With the looming H1N1 threat,
              can we afford public transportation to be overly congested? Do we want
              to increase the stress of living in Singapore with bad public
              transportation? We are currently promoting Singapore to be a city of
              the future and to attract people from around the world to live here. I
              heard that elections maybe coming soon and there maybe job rotation
              in the Transport Minister position. But please do ensure that the
              objectives which was set out 2 years ago are met. Public transportation
              is what millions of commuters in Singapore has to undertake each day.</p>
