              <p>That's so true.</p>
              <p>But I have little complaints for the public transport in general. I still get from Point A to B in a <em>realistic</em> time I project when I leave my house.

Even without the barriers, our roads are getting a little crowded. What happens without the barriers?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I realise that some people on the first page of the topic is seriously not thinking maturely. We have to realise that with us heavily depending on trains, we will face problems if anything happens to the train network. One example, the underground staffs strike in London caused major standstill to London's train network which cause people to take buses. Commuters who usually commute by train and do not have knowledge on the bus services were badly affected. From this, we must learn that we must not have any prejudice on any means of public transport, either buses, taxis or trains because they are basically the means to get around. We must also know the alternatives to trains to avoid unnecessary over-crowding in our train network which I observe is happening in SG.  </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess there are precisely a little or absolutely no improvements to Singapore's public transport landscape. Frequency for services like 963, are irregular during peak hours for the day, becuase of either heavy traffic at the AYE or a higher volume of passengers that are taking the bus beck to their hometowns. A problem is that especially the bus is overcrowding and some people have to wait for another 963 bus back, thus dragging their waiting time by either 10 to 20 mins.<br><br>Sometimes, waiting for a bus during Peak hours can be a fatigue to some passengers (who are running on a tight or hectic schedule), they may either reach home or go to work late and instead took the MRT after alighting from the nearby MRT station to save time and money. The impact with the handling of complains about its bus services from the members of the public is pressurised which signalised that at least a 'drastic' improvement should be made to public transport with ease and without a hassle. Extra buses should be deployed at a certain route of a service, whenever the current fleet of a service do not adequately cater the needs of the passengers especially in the Peak hours.</div>
