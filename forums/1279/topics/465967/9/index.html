              <p>Not only that 851 appearing on 969 WL slot raised an eyebrow for
              me. 46D on 318U slot 95L on 321J slot, 798P on 981B slot. Maybe
              536D replacing 320L also WLDEP since i took 756K wich replace 320L
              just now and its WLDEP.</p>

              <p>when was 95L spotted on 969? </p>
              <p>I took 95L 3 days go, which is 26 March, on 851, it was the 3rd last bus of 851 from SMU to home. The bus had to breakdown at YCK MRT there =X</p>
              <p>i remembered very clearly it was 95L. So it was still AMDEP then? or is already WLDEP 851? haha very confusing.</p>

              <p>Don't think is new buses. Rather, it can be due to WLDEP size increase and to ease overcrowding in AMDEP. </p>

              Now I suspect that one of the full days for 980 (the slot before 157S) got transferred to WLDEP as well. 756K did that slot for 2 days whereas 46D on that slot on Wed. Which means AMDEP now have only 5/11 full day duties.<p></p>

              <p>No choice but to keep sending in complaint letters until they give back 2 of Sv854 bendies. Such a high demand cashcow services and WLDEP dare to pull such stunts. Really nothing to say liao... SMRT goes down is always and always is because of horrible depots like WLDEP.</p>

KJ 190 to NBR also quite far, KJ 970 to Shenton Way i blive is quite far also. 700 also the same even though KJ/WL controlled. Unless all of them start late at around 6.30am for first bus.

              <p>Maybe 858 and 966 need that too coz i have seen both buses off svc from their looping point and its really really far. It may took 1h just to go back WLDEP from CGA or MP. I know some 969 WL bus end at Tamp too maybe that duty that end at Tamp cn go AMDEP.</p>
              <p>KJDEP needs to shift, it a bit inconvenient esp for BB ONP buses who have to go all the way to KJDEP and come back BB for ONP. They can shift somewhere down to around BB or CCK area.</p>
