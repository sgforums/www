              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>For the one that has to overnight park it just means the next
                  day's AM shift can come in later rather than pick up his bus from
                  the depot, so if you save time on the PM it essentially transfers
                  over to the AM portion only. So the difference is very
                  marginal.</p>
              <p>Maybe I stand corrected about WLDEP swapping 2 bendies out, but
                  they have been replacing it with rigids on a fair basis, even
                  swapping out the S shift bendies with rigids too. Freq has been
                  worst (thats the standard trademark of WLDEP controlled services -
                  poor management of scheduling efficiency), but the most awkward
                  thing is the fact that why even go WLDEP in the first place?</p>
              <p>1) On weekdays, several WLDEP AM shifts start their shift by
                  downrouting at Motorola towards Yishun, a bare 100m outside
                  AMDEP.</p>
              <p>2) The rest start off at Yishun, with the majority of AMDEP
                  shifts now going off to Bedok despite the fact that their BCs
                  collect the bus from Yishun itself (Note that previously it holds
                  true too since there is only 1 depot control, half the fleet goes
                  down to Bedok to start but now you have two depot controls, it is
                  supposed to make things easier and not complicated).</p>
              <p>3) Consider that if overnight parking at YII actually is
                  supposed to benefit AM drivers from just collecting their bus at
                  the <em>starting point</em>, then WLDEP buses should theoretically
                  start at Bedok which defeats the whole purpose of transferring
                  control to another depot much much further away.</p>
              <p>4) On weekends, half the WLDEP AM shifts start off at Bedok, and
                  about the same number end off at Bedok as well.</p>
              <p>If you consider so much inconsistencies, why even transfer to
                  WLDEP in the first place? AMDEP is the best midpoint for this
                  service, and giving up partial control to WLDEP just based on the
                  fact that YII is equally close to both depots just does not make
                  sense except for the fact that it is to free up more space. I'd
                  rather they split up other Yishun services like 851 or 855 to KJDEP
                  instead.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>851 and 855 to WLDEP I am fine.</p>
              <p>No are you serious about WLD 854 starters starting their trips near YCK area? It would really be time wasting WLBP-SLE-Jalan Kayu and towards the YCK area I think it would be best if they return some of them to AMDEP seriously or make the AMDEP buses downroute to YCK area not the WLD buses to do these downroutes for them. If WLDEP really do just that they really have nothing better to do seriously.</p>
              <p>Can you list out the duties of WLDEP 854 that end in bedok? Would appreciate that.</p>
