            <div class='col-md body'>From my observations, the delays @ the Causeway or Tuas @ the Singapore are due 50 % to bad road design leading to the complex (especially @ the Causeway !) other 50 % due to plain Singaporean 'deleberate' inefficientcy cleverly disguised / excused on 'security' grounds !!!!<br><br>My belief as why they appear be deliberately slowing everything down<br>(as much as they can) is due to the 'discomfort' caused to some people in Singapore of seemingly too many Singaporeans going frequently over to Johore &amp; spending too much S$ there !! Therefore the unavoidable speculation then is that they try to make it as unattractive as possible for people here to convinently get there &amp; back !!!!!!<br><br>Overall i find the Malaysian approach to checking on people/vehicles the more practical way which offers a superior trade-off between security concerns &amp; human &amp; vehicular traffic flow efficiencies ! The Malaysian side may appear 'sleeping' half the time but in actuality i've ever seen them knowing 'when' to check &amp; when to pass basing on prior experiences of human psychology upon having seen so many thousands (many familar even !) of faces crossing daily. When they indeed do check it tends to be quite a 'good hit' ! Such 'victims' were most obviously surprised as i saw the look on their faces ! Therefore i observe that although on the surface the Malaysian side appears less competent or more lax etc., it's highly not advisable to 'take advantage' of that. Indeed they seem to know the human psychological aspects much better than what many 'stuck-up' Singaporeans seem to think that they're bodoh inside &amp; try to take advantage of that !<br><br>The Singapore side i prefer to believe likes to put up plenty of 'show' for people to see, even from miles away while the Malaysian side tends to be more 'discrete' so people think they're 'sloppy' compared to the Simgapore side. But in ultimate reality i have to conclude that afterall don't be too surprised that the 'nett effect' of the different approaches taken need NOT yield any significantly different outcomes !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Apex-LW'21:</div><div class="quote_body">It's NOT processing of passports, there are now stringent security checks in Singapore, thr ICA officers trained to look out for any items like cigarettes to be smuggled to Singapore or any suspicious character.

            <div class='col-md body'>things in JB may not be cheaper after considering the time and hassle. But hey! Singaporeans, sundays and PH, and lopng weekends always like to go to JB Shopping + food. To many,. sundays are boring, same for chinese new year. CNY ppl go to Bangkok, HK etc etc. Sundays to JB.<br><br>so why go JB to shop? as said, to kill time,  second is the thinkn ing that JB goods are dirt cheap. not anymore.</div>
