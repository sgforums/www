Handal Indah should start learning how to THINK OUT OF THE BOX or exercise some LATERAL THINKING if it wants to salvage CW3 or else it's on the brink of extinction. Already there are rumours (well, my friend heard from one the staff whom she's quite pally with..) that HI is currently not even able to cover CW3's operational cost but 'the boss' (whoever that is...) is still trying to see how he can sustain CW3. I hope 'the boss' brain can BE MORE CREATIVE to tackle whatever problems CW3 is facing. HI shouldn't be too conventional but be more contemporary! As the saying goes, "IF THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A WAY". If the route can be shorten yet benefitting many more passengers at the same time, then maybe the MYR ticket price from JB side can be slightly reduced too.<br><br>Indeed HI should target all the Tamans within Gelang Patah's reach.<br>Obviously, we all know it's so stupid to have its starting base &amp; terminal at Kotaraya... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  For Tmn Perling-Bkt Indah route, they can start from Perling Mall.

That is, one CW3 travels from Gelang Patah, through Bukit Indah, Taman Perling, Perling Mall, Taman Tampoi whatever, Kip Mart, Taman Sri Yakoob, Best Mart, Taman Sutera Utama, Taman Ungku Tun Aminah, Lima Kedai, and back to Gelang Patah.  Another travels in the opposite direction.  At the same time, get rid of 666, part of whose route is taken over by CW3.  This helps link the western and north-western housing estates together, besides linking them to Gelang Patah and hence Jurong East.  The inter-housing estate passenger traffic may help increase revenues.<br><br>To reduce losses, the off-peak frequency of the Jurong East-Gelang Patah service can be reduced to, perhaps, one departure per hour, but following strict departure times, not intervals that result in unpredictable departure times.<br><br>Obviously, I have no idea on the amount of work behind the scene that is needed to achieve these.  Anyway, Handal Indah was already given the URL and topic name of this discussion on 2005-10-10.  So, it can assess suggestions that interest it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As i've said, it definitely is possible to reduce the frequency during times of low passenger loading so long as puntuality is enhanced. People would ultimately still know of CW3's existence whether it runs say once every 15 minutes or every hour or even every 12 hours !! They have to make sure their buses are there @ the stated times with not more than say +/- 15 minutes accuracy then people know they're reliable &amp; people would then be able to plan their time accordingly &amp; still find it attractive to patronize them in the long run.<br><br>Only increase the frequency back later on if demand increases as in the meantime i see absolutely no sense to drive near empty buses around frequenly during low load times just for publicity purposes, which regular media advertisments would be a far more cost effective method instead to keep people informed of their presense !!<br><br>[BTW, i find it a far bigger laughing stock seeing those Citybuzz in Singapore running around largely empty with typically 0 to 5 passengers !! for many months already....so you see, merely running near empty buses around with high frequencies like here does not tend to make economic or practical sense.]<br><br>I certainly don't think HI would incur greater potential of losses by focusing it's services on mainly the market which presently forms most of its passenger base i.e. regular commutors between JB &amp; SGP during the daily peak hours. In fact i'll even say it makes great sense to do just that ! Afterall, it's wiser to do all the possible to satisfy whatever existing customers you have now 1st than to try to plan too far ahead 'to conquer the moon in 1 shot' by trying to reach out to the other largely yet non-existent type of customers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">I think Handal Indah is s-t-r-u-g-g-l-i-n-g (or barely surviving...) in trying to earn any little profit from its running of CW3. First of all, 2nd Link is not a popular route during off-peak hour but HI is trying its best to maintain an image of consistency so that the public knows there'll always be CW3 buses traveling to and fro JB-S'pore via 2nd Link round the clock the whole day, everyday, whether peak or off-peak, many or few passengers, rain or shine. But in doing so, it is suffering a loss because ferrying less than 10 or even less than 5 passengers whether from GP or JE during off-peak definitely cannot cover the operational cost.<br><br>A passenger ever told me that she normally boards the CW3 in the mid-morning which is during off-peak as she has a totally different working hour from us. And there was once she waited 1&amp;1/2 hour at Gelang Patah for the S'pore-bound bus. She was so turned-off that she decided sheÂ’ll no longer board CW3 when going to work, except only when returning from SÂ’pore. So it does seem that it is very difficult for HI to meet the needs of the few passengers during off-peak without resulting in losses on its end. It also causes HI to lose more and more passengers as people began to discover that it is not very ideal to take CW3 to SG during off-peak.<br><br>So what is the implication if HI decide to only run CW3 during the peak hours or fix a certain service timing, say between 5.30amÂ–12nn &amp; 5pm -11pm and weekends round the clock? Will HI suffer greater loss if it pours in more concentrated efforts to meet only the needs of the working class during weekdays?</div></blockquote></div>

What a hellish experience... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hmm... the bus which I boarded from Tmn Perling on 18-Oct also went 1/2 the roundabout just as you've described but I can't remember whether on that day I caught the 0710 or 0740 JE-bound CW3 from GP.... 'Coz these days, I decided to stick to either one of these 2 time slot as both are fine with me. If I want to play safe, of course I always hope that my bus get to meet the 0710 JE-bound CW3 on its way out of GP so that I get to swap. But if I'm late and I only get to catch the 0740 bus is also fine with me because by then the jam at 2nd Link has almost cleared and I can still reach JE by 0830.<br><br>In the past, I used to be kiasu, waking up in the wee hours of the morning, trying to catch the 0640 JE-bound CW3 from GP. That was because I used to start work at 0830 then but since my company is quite flexible, so recently I changed it to 0900 when I discovered that taking the 0710 or 0740 bus is a far better choice! The 0610 &amp; 0640 JE-bound CW3 is getting is extremely packed these daysÂ… itÂ’s becoming a very stressful ride to work with all that crowd running out of immigration and pushing each other. And since I was already experiencing lethargy due to waking up so early, I told myself it isnÂ’t worth my money if I have to suffer like this every morning.<br><br>So now I find it very relaxing to board the 0710 or 0740 JE-bound CW3Â… except of course when some folks from Tmn Perling-Bkt Indah missed the 0640 JE-bound and ended up on the 0710 bus. But even if that happens, the crowd is not as terrible as the 0640 one...<br><br>But anyway, recently I also realised that CW3 has altered the timing of the 0710 JE-bound bus... for this whole week, I noticed that it only departs GP at 0720.... I'm beginning to sense that CW3 is trying to subtlely change the schedule again...<br><br></div>

CW3 drivers are mainly Malay men except for one chinese "uncle" called TONY (driver of 3105). Hehe...<br><br>Tony's a nice chap. Do you know that it was because of him that CW3 started driving in to Bkt Indah?? He was the only driver who started exploring Bkt Indah last time... but other staff at GP used to comment that he too "kay-poh".... At one time, he stopped doing so because his superior didn't like the idea but after a while, Handal Indah decided to give it a go. So all thanks to Tony! He changed the course of CW3's history. Haha... When you see him, smile and say hi.</div>

And since nobody answered, only then did he feel justified to drive straight to Jalan Layang.<br><br>Honestly, isn't it rather confusing when sometimes the driver goes to roundabout first, then Bkt Indah while other times Bkt Indah first, then roundabout? Whether it's heading town or GP, most drivers do it according to how they like it. It's all impromptu or led by their mood swings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

All he said was, "I dunno... for this matter, you'll need to check with JB side..." Then he dialled his mobile phone and pass it to me to pour out my grievances to his colleague at JB.<br><br>If he's @ boss or managerial position, then he sure didn't seem like he knew how to tend to the passengers' needs and problems. He actually re-directed my complaints to another colleague! If he's uniformed, I'd understand that some of the things we're unhappy about are not within his control but the fact that he seem to behave like he's the "boss" yet he didn't know how to tackle CW3's shortcomings.<br><br>Once I saw him at Tuas checkpoint sitting down to chat with the time-keeper. His manner was like someone who cared &amp; wanted to find out how are things with his subordinate.

This was the man who ordered the fat Malay driver of svc. 666 to drive us back to Bkt Indah-Tmn Perling one evening.<br><br>It's funny, an UN-uniformed man going round acting like the boss doesn't know how to tackle situations when there are lack of buses but the uniformed staff who's apparently of lower rank could instead "boss" around the drivers, and apologised to the passengers for making us wait.<br><br>Like the title of an old sitcom "Who's the Boss?" - I see HI staff playing reversed roles.</div>
