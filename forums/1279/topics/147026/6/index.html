            <div class='col-md body'>The standard gearbox is M-B 6-speed manual, which i think is cheaper than an  automatic. Maybe they targeting this chassi @ a wider market so they put the lower cost features as standard unless the customer wants an 'upsize' ?<br>HI does use ZF automatic, but mainly on those with kampong roof bodies &amp; as for the contemporary body types (like on CW3) they use both types of gearbox.<br>The automatic gearbox is as usual noisier than the manual, with much whinning  during acceleration but becomes as quiet as the manual once final gear reached.<br><br>BTW, even the O 405 did have manual gear option although the standard item is automatic it seemed.<br><br>From my observations &amp; sensing, there seems to be 3 different engine &amp; chassi models of such M-B new generation (i.e. with 4-spoke steering-wheel) air-suspended charged-cooled bus-chassi in use in Malaysia. Hi may be using 2 out of the 3 models. Transtar the 3rd model with Mtrans coachwork, where the engine sounds more MAN-like &amp; with single tapered-down exhaust pipe as on the Travego &amp; newer OC 500 series. HI's models the single-exhaust pipe is straight out on the rear-right instead &amp; with 2 different sounding engines &amp; 2 different dashboard instrumentation panels.<br><br>The model with the higher end dashboard they only use on the JB-KL express which comes with the more 'resonating' engine. I believe that's the IBC 1632. The other model with the more commonly seen dashboard (also as used by Transtar &amp; few others) they use on CW3 &amp; few other routes within JB. This i believe is the CBC 1725. I won't rule out that the OC 500 may also be in-use in Malaysia now. OC 500 i've been informed is a very 'broad' description which encompasses many models like 1830, 1832 maybe even a 1840 etc. Nowadays the Malaysian market for M-B bus-chassi is moving higher end to the over 300 BHP class.<br><br>A likeable thing about HI is that they give the driver the chance to fine-tune the air-con settings such the level of coolness is more suited to the situation @ hand i.e. not being excessively cold till condensation occurs which mists up the windows &amp; causing discomfort rather than comfort ! Most HI buses i've been on the air-con is set in the 'ok' range &amp; not over done. Only a few cases (like many cases here unfortunately on SBST) were the air-con set ridiculously cold that the driver doesn't know how to adjust &amp; wears jacket instead !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">Sounds very exciting. I'll give it a shot this weekend. For a citybus chassis, I find it interesting that it was fitted with a manual transmission (going retro, perhaps?). I thought it was automatic. Which makes me wonder, is it the same type of chassis as the ones used for the Causeway Link Express?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Maju 262 i recall went into Gelang Patah terminal while on the way to Tuas from Larkin, so naturally the journey should be longer.<br><br>Now with CW3, from Perling Mall to Jurong East Interchange, i recall it takes about 50 mins.<br><br>Of course from Tuas to Jurong East, if going by SBST, it takes much longer than 20 mins. since there's no direct link via SBST &amp; those 2 routes of theirs wind in &amp; out of the factory areas quite some time wastage there.<br><br>I recall there may be public car parks @ Johor CIQ complex. Gelang Patah would seem out of the way to me to park, since then you'll change over to route 666 to reach there from Johor CIQ bus-stop. If you stay in Bukit Indah (which i vaguely recall you once said you have a house there ?) then might as well park in Bukit Indah. Coming from Perling &amp; going pass quite some new housing developments in Bukit Indah, CW3 stops just shortly before turning left onto the expressway heading torwards Tuas. But Bukit Indah seems very big &amp; spread out estate so might be difficult to decide on where best to park there ?! Perling Mall might be convinent since CW3 also stops opposite Perling Mall.<br><br>I don't know where's central town park of Bukit Indah, but i recall CW3 went pass some very new buildings, some looking like condonimiums or houses behind gated compounds with quite high class looking frontage with security sentry for vehicles going in &amp; out of it. But i saw already occupied new looking houses on the right &amp; still under construction shophouses on the left while heading towards Tuas. Maybe there was a Petronas fuel station on the opposite side of the expressway after coming out of Bukit Indah &amp; heading towards Tuas ?<br><br>I think you should be able to make out something from my description since you should know that area better. By the way, are the semi-d &amp; bungalows in Taman Sutera completed yet ??

            <div class='col-md body'>The 3 steps height about same as O 405 &amp; the floor is largely flat, from the entrance till the rear axle where it then rises a little with a raised platform below the seats, also similar to on the O 405. This i classify as entry-level low floor citybus. It's not ultra low-floor though because low profile tyres not used &amp; not zero steps.<br><br>What model ? This uses HI's own bodywork but with the headlamp &amp; rear lampset taken from the O 580 i.e. Travego coach ! They try to copy Travego's front grill but omited the fog-lamps eventhough the 'imprint' was 'stamped' on the bumper.<br>The M-B bus-chassi used should be CBC 1725 in the Malaysian way of describing the model but i believe the more complete model description would be O 500 /1725-CBC i.e. this model from the new generation O 500 series, which it seems how the Australian &amp; Brazilian markets know it as. I believe it's essentially the same as OC 500 series as known in other markets like Germany. I was told 'OC' means 'omnibus chassi' so if they just say 'O 500' then may result in confusion since technically that can mean an integraly constructed coach with original M-B bodywork + chassi. There exist O 404 in chassi form but O 404 tends more associated as an original M-B coach i.e. with coachwork &amp; chassi all from M-B. So i suppose in later time they devised this term 'OC' for the generation after the O 404 like O 500 etc. to make clear OC 500 is only bus-chassi (without the M-B bodywork) for those buying this way. But it seems in Australia &amp; Brazil they tend not use the term 'OC' so they refer to the OC 500 still as O 500 etc. but knowing the background their O 500 cannot possibly be an integral coach or bus but only in bus-chassi form instead.<br><br>The engine model used in CBC 1725 i note is OM 906 LA, which is basically the same engine model as on the Citaro which uses it in OM 906 hLA form i.e. flips it flat instead of standing vertical on the chassi. Other differences seems to be difference in 1 valve per cylinder i.e. in CBC 1725 it's 24-valve engine but in Citaro only 18-valves. Overall looking @ this engine &amp; noting the specs., i see the highest output from this 6374 cc model is 279 BHP with Euro-3 emission standard, which seems quite impressive in view of the small cc. [Volvo in the B9TL would use a much bigger cc engine to match this, which doesn't sound so efficient to me ?!]<br><br>But, with other factors kept constant, a Euro-3 rated model should be more expensive than Euro-2 rated model eventhough otherwise largely the same thing. So they likely specified it only to Euro-2 level for the same engine in CBC 1725 for Malaysian use to keep the price down. But nice to note the potential of having Euro-3 from the same engine + with higher power output as well.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by carbikebus:</div><div class="quote_body">Then what model is this may i know?Is the steps high?Pardon my ignorances <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

They try to copy Travego's front grill but omited the fog-lamps eventhough the 'imprint' was 'stamped' on the bumper.<br>The M-B bus-chassi used should be CBC 1725 in the Malaysian way of describing the model but i believe the more complete model description would be O 500 /1725-CBC i.e. this model from the new generation O 500 series, which it seems how the Australian &amp; Brazilian markets know it as. I believe it's essentially the same as OC 500 series as known in other markets like Germany. I was told 'OC' means 'omnibus chassi' so if they just say 'O 500' then may result in confusion since technically that can mean an integraly constructed coach with original M-B bodywork + chassi. There exist O 404 in chassi form but O 404 tends more associated as an original M-B coach i.e. with coachwork &amp; chassi all from M-B. So i suppose in later time they devised this term 'OC' for the generation after the O 404 like O 500 etc. to make clear OC 500 is only bus-chassi (without the M-B bodywork) for those buying this way. But it seems in Australia &amp; Brazil they tend not use the term 'OC' so they refer to the OC 500 still as O 500 etc. but knowing the background their O 500 cannot possibly be an integral coach or bus but only in bus-chassi form instead.<br><br>The engine model used in CBC 1725 i note is OM 906 LA, which is basically the same engine model as on the Citaro which uses it in OM 906 hLA form i.e. flips it flat instead of standing vertical on the chassi. Other differences seems to be difference in 1 valve per cylinder i.e. in CBC 1725 it's 24-valve engine but in Citaro only 18-valves. Overall looking @ this engine &amp; noting the specs., i see the highest output from this 6374 cc model is 279 BHP with Euro-3 emission standard, which seems quite impressive in view of the small cc. [Volvo in the B9TL would use a much bigger cc engine to match this, which doesn't sound so efficient to me ?!]<br><br>But, with other factors kept constant, a Euro-3 rated model should be more expensive than Euro-2 rated model eventhough otherwise largely the same thing. So they likely specified it only to Euro-2 level for the same engine in CBC 1725 for Malaysian use to keep the price down. But nice to note the potential of having Euro-3 from the same engine + with higher power output as well.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm,Some sort like Malaysian &amp; Australian MAN 18.280 Where the latter uses front disc brakes while the former use drum instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like some Chinese saying, you pay 1 cent get 1 cent of goods !<br><br>But nice to note that overall the differences are minor, because they can<br>subsequently upgrade it themselves just like they replace spare parts in routine servicing later on. It could work out cheaper that they keep the initial OMV down by specifying only the basics when buying the entire vehicle chassis, due to the stupid %-age based nature of some of these taxes. Then later on they 'quietly' buy the upgrade parts as spare parts form (i.e. not as part of a complete bus-chassis etc.) so as to attract possibly lower taxes on the parts since bough seperately &amp; do the modifications during maintenance servicing.<br><br>I believe such practice quite common in the car industry, whereby they import a model in it's most basic specs. (to minimise tax exggerations) then subsequently import the upgrade parts in parts form (not part of any complete car) &amp; overall paying lower taxes hence keeping costs down while still utimately getting the car up to the required higher specs. level.<br><br>BTW, O 405 uses all round drum brakes although O 404 is all round disc brakes, for tour coach use. But i recall once onboard an O 405 the driver did emergency brake from ~ 40 km/h to zero with only ~ 3 meters to a taxi in front !! What happened you think ? The braking force was extremely hard but still managed to dead stop without touching that idiot infront, who didn't get moving eventhough the traffic light was green ! No retarder or other secondary braking seemed to be used (@ such road speeds) so the braking effort would be mostly if not 100 % primary, via the drum brakes. If disc brakes used, i suppose the distance a little lesser, with less heat generated i.e. for citybus use, benefits of disc over drum brakes not tend to be as great as when for tour coach use on highways or mountaineous roads etc.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by carbikebus:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm,Some sort like Malaysian &amp; Australian MAN 18.280 Where the latter uses front disc brakes while the former use drum instead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>About SMRT (TIBS) vehicles, based on my more recent trips aboard their buses, i noted the situation is now more 'down to earth' in that no more condensation on glass areas &amp; air-con blower not excessively windy &amp; more quiet as such &amp; the interior temperatures now within acceptable ranges.<br>The air-con compressor cuts-in only when cooling required again &amp; this also makes for a quieter ride since the compressor (hence drony noise) is not (wastefully) kept ON all the time. That's more like what i experienced onboard HI's buses &amp; most outstation coaches &amp; that's what it should be !<br><br>Don't know if you've noticed how silent the air-con can be on coaches from KL to JB or SGP from quite a few operators ?? That's because they all bother to set it properly i.e. just cool enough &amp; not over breezy the same time as too much wind blowing also no good as it dries up the skin faster causing discomfort of another kind !<br><br>As for writing to THOSE papers, i don't find it too different than if i write it here ! That's because afterall, both are essentially still forums just that it's on paper there while it's paperless here instead. Both would still get read utimately by the public &amp; even their own staff as i'm NOT that naive to believe that NONE ?? of the staff from the major transport operators here would know of the existence of this bus forum &amp; not read the posts here ?!?? Afterall, they are in the bus industry &amp; it's really in their interest to bother to least take some 'glances' @ what's happening in this bus forum so therefore not likely @ all that they can claim ignorance to the existence of this forum &amp; the posted material contained within it.<br><br>Another good reason to me why i dislike writing to THOSE papers is because i value my privacy &amp; as such don't like to disclose my name, IC#, address, phone etc. &amp; etc. just over 1 letter !! I don't need the whole world to know my real name (or who i am for that matter) i'm most glad they just take note of what i've got to say &amp; act (positively) upon it ! That's good enough for me. I reject this idea of theirs that in order for them take one's letter 'seriously' etc. they 'need' to know the real name of the writer !! That's rubbish to me. I expect them to evaluate one's feedback based purely on the merits of the feedback &amp; NOT be sidetracked as to bother WHO is writing the feedback ! As if it's someone 'important' writing then they take it seriously else if it's just some nobody making noise, then they don't take it seriously ?!?

            <div class='col-md body'>I was also somewhat surprised when told of the RM 7.5 fare from Kota Raya to Jurong East Interchange. But they reasoned it by saying they work out the fare on the basis of convertion from S$ fare, which i understand is S$ 3.20 from Jurong East to Kota Raya. Seems they won't be as generous as in CW2 or like SJE &amp; blindly consider the same numerical amount like S$ 2.4 or RM 2.4 in those cases. Understandable in view of the huge distances of this route which i believe is much longer than that covered by CW1, CW2, SJE, SBST 170 or 160 !!<br>Also the higher toll charges of 2nd Link &amp; JB Parkway tolls, which i noted on my trip costs ~ RM 10.30 per bus for JB Parkway alone.<br><br>From my observations, i don't think they expect the bulk of the passengers heading for Jurong East to board from Kota Raya, mainly because they know there's other potentially faster ways to reach Jurong East from Kota Raya under normal traffic conditions. They instead expect most heading for Singapore on CW3 to board somewhere down the route, like from Perling region onwards towards the West side. Therefore the fares they actually pay to Singapore would then be lower, due to the stepped-fare structure.<br><br>If you're @ Perling you're already roughly half-way between Jurong East &amp; Kota Raya so that it then makes much sense to use CW3 instead of finding your way back to Kota Raya &amp; switching over to SBST 160 etc. to get Jurong East.<br>Vice-versa for those from Jurong East heading up to say Perling area.<br>Only in the more exceptional situations would it be expected that people board from Singapore on CW3 &amp; head all the way to Kota Raya end. So i suppose HI won't be too bothered of any complains of the higher fare of RM 7.5 or S$ 3.2 noting the travel profiles of most of their passengers on CW3.<br><br>BTW, what time did you take CW3 from Kota Raya ? How was the Causeway traffic situation then ? How was the 2nd Link traffic too ?<br><br>On my trip to Singapore which was in the evening (clearly off-peak time as such), noted 5 passengers including myself heading for Singapore, most got onboard only after Perling area. Dozen or so got off earlier after getting on from Kota Raya area.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hseochin:</div><div class="quote_body">I recall there may be public car parks @ Johor CIQ complex. Gelang Patah would seem out of the way to me to park, since then you'll change over to route 666 to reach there from Johor CIQ bus-stop. If you stay in Bukit Indah (which i vaguely recall you once said you have a house there ?) then might as well park in Bukit Indah. Coming from Perling &amp; going pass quite some new housing developments in Bukit Indah, CW3 stops just shortly before turning left onto the expressway heading torwards Tuas.  But Bukit Indah seems very big &amp; spread out estate so might be difficult to decide on where best to park there ?! Perling Mall might be convinent since CW3 also stops opposite Perling Mall.<br><br>I don't know where's central town park of Bukit Indah, but i recall CW3 went pass some very new buildings, some looking like condonimiums or houses behind gated compounds with quite high class looking frontage with security sentry for vehicles going in &amp; out of it. But i saw already occupied new looking houses on the right &amp; still under construction shophouses on the left while heading towards Tuas. Maybe there was a Petronas fuel station on the opposite side of the expressway after coming out of Bukit Indah &amp; heading towards Tuas ?<br></div></blockquote>Hmm...  There are shops of a few stories tall surrounding the central town park.  As for gated compounds, there is one beside the show village, also near the central town park.  Other gates visible from the potential routes probably do not look high class enough.  Will have to wait until I have returned home to figure out the route.  Thanks.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I think you should be able to make out something from my description since you should know that area better. By the way, are the semi-d &amp; bungalows in Taman Sutera completed yet ?? Might just want to buy 1 unit there for self occupation later !<br></strong></blockquote>There are new houses and new shops at Taman Sutera Utama.  Should be close to completion now.  I think they are again three-story linked houses, not semi-detached or bungalows.<br><br>The construction of semi-detached houses in Bukit Indah started quite a while ago.  Might complete after another half a year.  They are about five to ten minutes of walk from the show village.<br><br></div>
