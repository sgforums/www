Are they trying to say that they only have 'so few' manpower available to perform security duty that only these few men/women can do the job that that's why they 'need' to squeeze everybody thru the stupid bottlenecks ?!??<br><br>They really have 'no money' to hire more security staff, open more counters, build more lanes etc. to do all the necessary to not only maintain security but ALSO to improve both human &amp; vehicular traffic discharge efficiencies ?!??<br><br>I most honestly cannot believe that ! Surely they cannot just rely on just those 'few' exisiting security staff to man the thousands of people &amp; vehicles passing in/out daily ! They can perhaps learn something from the wide spread out concept used in the Malaysian toll booths e.g. of spreading out the traffic such that everybody is still 'inspected upon' before being 'passed' to go i.e. nobody 'escapes' paying their tolls &amp; what not ? Surely it cannot mean that you must have just 2 or 3 narrow lanes then the security is 'good' else with many more lanes the security 'drops' ?!?? That's nonsense logic because it's not asking the existing few staff to mann many more lanes BUT to hire more new personnel to mann the increased lanes instead ! The nett result in security levels is practically the same except that more can be processed in the same time ! Surely the Singapore Government is rich &amp; competent enough to acquire more such personnel to do the jobs ! No funds is certainly no excuse here, if that's what they thinking of saying !!!! No land here to build more spread out lanes they can resort to building more multi-storey lanes instead. No excuses !<br>It's only money involved, something they are well rich enough to afford !!<br><br>Whatever those few security men/women are now doing surely they can produce more such personnel thru more hiring &amp; training etc. such that each &amp; everyone of them can produce the same standard of work output WITHOUT compromising in overall security 'stringentness' !<br><br>The end result then is that whatever exisiting security levels are maintained if not enhanced AND the same time improving on the human &amp; vehicular processing discharge rates hence processing efficientcies thru their complex.<br><br>I don't think they need to wait for the new giant size Johor complex to set the standard before learning from them ! Singapore is supposed to be more 'advanced' &amp; 'efficient' etc.<br></blockquote></strong><br><br>Yes, much indeed can be done to improve the design of the Tuas checkpoint AND efficiency of the immigration and security check procedures indeed. But have you wondered why the usually efficient and smart Singapore authorities have not taken steps to make this improvement? Why spend money on hiring more manpower and renovating/re-designing the immigration building and improving the workflow when that will encourage more Singaporeans to spend money overseas? Just keep to the same old ways, make it more inefficient and jammed so that'll teach us Singaporeans not to venture over the causeway. Put yourself in their shoes and you'll understand the reason behind all this.<br><br>On the other hand, for Malaysian authorities, there's plenty of reason to improve on their immigration efficiency =&gt; to encourage more Singaporeans to go over and spend their SGD, thereby improving the Malaysian economy.<br><br>Makes sense now, doesn't it?</div>

This is because the second-link bridge is about 2 kilometers long.  When it was full of cars on two lanes, the next car that joined the queues had about (2 lanes x 2000 meters / 4 meters per car = 1000 cars) in front of it.  That car took about 2 hours to get to the other side of the checkpoint.  This implies the checkpoint took about 2 hours to clear the 1000 cars in front of it, giving a clearance rate of about (1000 cars / 120 minutes = 8.33 cars per minute).  If each car was packed with 5 people, then the load on the computers generated by the incoming car users at the Tuas checkpoint was only about (8.33 cars per minute x 5 people per car = 41.67 people per minute).<br><br>It was reported elsewhere that car users at the Woodlands checkpoint also experienced wait times of a similar scale.  So, we can make a simplistic assumption that both checkpoints had similar loads during that period.  Then the total load on the immigration computers for car users was only about (41.67 x 4 = 166 people per minute).  This load seems a little too low compared to the expected capacity of the immigration computer system.<br><br>If we assume 600 people per minute mentioned earlier is a reasonable estimate of the combined car user clearance capacity of the two checkpoints, then the checkpoints were operating at only about 27.67 percent efficiency during that period.<br><br>Therefore, the long wait time experienced was likely to be due to computer system outages, caused by humans intentionally, or because of poor human resource planning.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about security checks, have you noted the average time taken by either Singapore or Malaysian side to check on a car ? From my personal experiences &amp; observations on my car trips over the years i note both sides take about the SAME overall time to perform an inspection !<br><br>That includes time taken to get out of car to show boot contents, some fiddling thru the items in the boot/inside the car etc.<br><br>In both sides, not every car is subject to the same inspections anyway &amp; usually it tends to be a 'pause &amp; go' type of 'check' in both complexes !<br>Only some cars get 'inspected' typically while the rest just pause briefly &amp; continue to drive thru.<br><br>Therefore my conclusion is that overall, the security checking (in itself) of a car etc. is NOT the 'overhelming' factor as to the overall lower perceived levels of processing speed &amp; efficientcy @ the complexes. Rather it's a major factor but as major as other factors (no more no less) like the processing capacity &amp; road design into &amp; out from the complexes.<br><br>What i'm implying is that, even if there's 100 % no car inspection @ all (i.e. all cars just drive thru like those with 'TMJ' or 'Johor' plates), however due to the shortcomings of the road network to/from the complexes, the incidence of slowdown in clearance rates &amp; efficientcy would remain still quite high due to these other contributary causes !! Therefore they must improve on the road capacities to/from the complexes besides enhancing their checking counter capacities thru deploying more counters &amp; staff ! Of course understood also to do any upgrade of the computers used in the processing !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Apex-LW'21:</div><div class="quote_body">As I had mentioned this before, M'sian side of 2nd link is faster, but stuck because Singapore have security checks and some counters were closed (almost half).</div></blockquote></div>

These are the restricted and international passports.<br><br>The Malaysian immigration staff do not really care to check restricted passports, because the immigration department simply does not have the capacity to handle the volume.  People usually use a blue cover for restricted passports, so this kind of passports is easily identifiable.  However, it does mean foreigners who resemble locals can easily enter and leave Malaysia through the causeway and second-link checkpoints without being recorded.  I think the staff also do random checks based on the age, attire and behavior of the passport holders.   Legitimate frequent travelers are usually of a certain age group, wear certain attire and exhibit a certain behavior, making them identifiable to some extent.  Anyway, this kind of passports will cease to be valid within the next couple of years due to the lack of relevant security features.<br><br>New international passports have embedded chips.  They usually have a red cover.  But as far as I know, the readers are only installed at the autogates and counters.  There have been concerns that personal data can be read unknowingly from quite a bit of distance away.  But so far this effect does not seem to have been taken advantage of at the two checkpoints for security and clearance efficiency enhancements.  The holders of this kind of passports need to be recorded by the computer system when going through the checkpoints, though stampings are no longer done.  Stampings are done for old international passports, which do not have embedded chips.</div>
