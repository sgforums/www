            <div class='col-md body'>When i used CW3, i noted the lowest fare charged is RM 1 something, from JBCS to some nearby area before Perling. My observations suggests that CW3 is overall NOT a flat fare based service, but charges step fares based on distance to travel, like CW1 or SBST 170 or 160 etc. Also note that CW3 does call @ a few stops along the route from SGP &amp; MY &amp; vice-versa so therefore it's NOT an express service like SJE.<br><br>I was charged RM 7.5 from Kota Raya to Jurong East &amp; told to keep the ticket to show in case i board another bus if the same 1 missed @ Johor CIQ.<br><br>I do believe fares for CW3 &amp; 666 are charged independently &amp; seperately, just as per normal when you switch from 1 service to another of the same or different operator.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hannwei:</div><div class="quote_body">According to the news article at:<br><br>http://www.chinapress.com.my/content.asp?dt=2005-08-31&amp;sec=local&amp;art=0831lj01.txt<br><br>the fares are:<br><br>Jurong East --(by CW3)-&gt; Johor CIQ : 2.00 SGD  (flat fare)<br>Jurong East &lt;-(by CW3)-- Johor CIQ : 2.50 MYR  (flat fare)<br>Jurong East --(by CW3)-&gt; Kotaraya : 3.00 SGD  (flat fare)<br>Jurong East &lt;-(by CW3)-- Kotaraya : 5.00 MYR  (flat fare)<br><br>Johor CIQ --(by 666)-&gt; Larkin : 5.00 MYR (lower fare for intermediate stops)<br>Johor CIQ &lt;-(by 666)-- Larkin : 5.00 MYR (lower fare for intermediate stops)<br><br>Thus,<br><br>Jurong East &lt;-(by CW3,666)-- Larkin : 2.50 + 5.00 = 7.50 MYR<br><br>May be the bus driver was confused when he or she charged 7.50 MYR for traveling on CW3 from Kotaraya to Jurong East.

            <div class='col-md body'>When i took CW3 from Jurong East recently, noted CW3 went to Gelang Patah station &amp; told to transfer to another CW3 there ! Noted 2 CW3's on standby there. Appears to me then transfers to 666 now takes place @ Gelang Patah instead of Johor CIQ ?<br><br>Maybe that's an exceptional arrangement since it was 9 in the evening, after peak hours ? Or because 2 passengers wanted to get off @ Gelang Patah &amp; since no 666 seen @ Johor CIQ when leaving there, the CW3 driver decided to detour to Gelang Patah to avoid those 2 having to wait for 666 ? But done @ the time expense of the dozen or so other passengers who ended up with a longer travel time of about 20 min. of which 10 min. spent waiting onboard the bus @ Gelang Patah station for nothing ! But in the direction towards Singapore CW3 didn't go into Gelang Patah, which is also expected to be so when returning from Singapore.<br><br>I don't find 666 'useless' though, because it serves those wanting to go more Northwards to Taman Sutera Utama, Taman Tun Aminah etc.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>CW3 &amp; 666 are 2 different services. Both happen to meet @ Johor CIQ stop.<br>So if you intend to use 666 after using CW3, then you only pay the fare for CW3 from Jurong East to Johor CIQ. Then when onboard 666 you buy a new ticket, just like you board any other service anywhere else.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">is there the flexibility of free transfer bet 666/ CW3 at TG Kupang? cos if not, 666 seems useless </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>l wonder whether CW 3 is profitable with the current passenger load. Seems that the service still has more room for improvement from the forum. Only took the service once to Taman Perling and back, and was lucky that the waiting time on both sides were still acceptable. The bus didn't turn into Gelang Patah though during the first Sunday after the launch.<br><br>Nonetheless, l hope that the service would survive as it serves as a good, alternative link to Malaysia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your observations...are these based from your actual personal experiences onboard CW3 or merely just assumptions based on what you appear to see of the Tuas traffic situation from some video cameras ??<br><br>I'm saying this because just recently i actually took CW3 from Jurong East to Kota Raya, just to 'test them out' on the return route to Malaysia. It was evening peak or just after peak time i.e. 20:00 &amp; lanes of cars were jammed on 2nd Link towards Tuas CIQ complex.<br><br>I notice anytime @ Jurong East there's only 1 CW3 vehicle in the parking lot, which would take the next load to JB. I also saw 1 unit just left earlier. So these being the case, common sense would suggest if the 2nd Link commercial vehicle lanes were not moving fast enough or badly jammed, then there wouldn't be those 2 units coming &amp; going @ intervals not longer than during real off-peak time like 9 or 10 later in the evening ?! They not known to keep reserve CW3 vehicles in Singapore somewhere to come out during jam time ?!<br><br>What i can say is that fortunately the road design @ Tuas CIQ is overall better than @ Woodlands CIQ whereby the commercial vehicle lanes do not 'cross over' to the car lanes somewhere down the line i.e. commercial vehicles use the leftward lanes only meant for them while cars use the righter lanes. You don't tend to see that stupid situation @ Woodlands where the bus lane is clear &amp; car lanes choked up &amp; you're on a bus before the traffic junction prior to going up the ramp &amp; the bus cannot proceed simply because its path is blocked by cars &amp; lorries crossing over in front of the bus &amp; blocking it !!!!<br>2nd Link i find traffic is overall more orderly although sometimes can be congested so still higher chance the bus would keep moving into the complex while the cars remain stuck on the stupid bridge !<br><br>These jams i find to be a good showcase of Singaporean inefficentcy in that they have such a big presumbly large capacity modern (white elephant especially @ Tuas operating way below capacity) complex YET still so slow in processing !! All these excuses of 'security' i have to pass off as excuses that's about it because if you really think about it, what's the 'extra' things they do that others don't do that would result in overall so slow a clearance ?!!? The times spent to check passport &amp; vehicles, on per unit basis, i don't find much differences whether in Johor or Singapore side ! Yet the Malaysian side even if supposely 'inferior' run-down facilities almost always manage to clear faster. I'm very eager to use their brand-new CIQ complex opposite JBCS...that should show which side is more efficient in processing clearance ! The Johor CIQ complex appears lower capacity than the big Tuas CIQ complex (with many unused lanes etc.) so understandably should be more congested than Tuas sometimes. I find the Johor side somewhat 'under designed' their CIQ while the Singapore side 'over designed' theirs !

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe i'll take some time before any profits start to surface &amp; i believe HI has the financial capacity to 'tahan' any initial risks of failure or other unpredictabilites of the business. Even overheard an SBST inspector @ Woodlands saying 'Malaysia have money one' as a new CW2 MAN 18.280 drove by !<br><br>As i observed @ Larkin, the off-peak demand for their JB-KL express (as with almost all the other operators there too) on say Tuesdays or Wednesdays @ 21:00 can be so bad that with only 0, 1 or 2 passengers !! Even saw them diverting the 1 or 2 such passengers to another operator's coach as i don't think HI wants to waste their new M-B 1632's on only 2 passengers ! HI then switched off the interior lighting on their coach &amp; drove it away.<br><br>Yet despite such setbacks from time to time, i see also 100% loading cases both to &amp; from KL too. So overall i figure they'll somehow still survive !<br><br>Now soon to launch next is the SGP-KL route from IMM !!<br>I think HI is thinking long term i.e. whether or not any profit right now, they take some calculated risks &amp; still take the plunge &amp; see how they eventually survive ?!? I suppose having a larger capacity bank account is especially helpful in such situations !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by i_love_blacky:</div><div class="quote_body">l wonder whether CW 3 is profitable with the current passenger load. Seems that the service still has more room for improvement from the forum. Only took the service once to Taman Perling and back, and was lucky that the waiting time on both sides were still acceptable. The bus didn't turn into Gelang Patah though during the first Sunday after the launch.<br><br>Nonetheless, l hope that the service would survive as it serves as a good, alternative link to Malaysia.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hah, just got back from johor.<br><br>Took CW3 from johor (perling mall) to Jurong east. Cost RM3.20, and journey was 1.5hrs. Expected it to be faster really, since it was 9am (off-peak already)on the highways and the Tuas CIQ situation is so much less chaotic than the woodlands one.<br><br>Btw, the Tuas CIQ appears to be quite deserted, it's just like the woodlands one with almost as many lanes but only 2 were open and no-one except the 10 people on my CW3 bus was passing through - the security personnel was no less though, with the result that there was this bunch of ICA staff and guards staring at the few of us dribbling through the security gates. Weird.<br><br>Anyway, the CW3 route can potentially be much faster and smoother, I think under an hour should be no prob. The reason for the delay is that there's just too much waiting time, and the drivers take their own time of day to get on with the ride. The bus from perling had to stop at gelang patah and everyone transfered to another CW3. And since there were only 3 of us, we had to wait for another bus load (of 7 pple!) to arrive and fill up more seats. During the wait the driver decided to go off for tea and we sat there waiting for him, and then another passenger decided to go to the loo, but the driver came back while he was gone and we took off without him. Poor fella (but more of him later).<br><br>So onwards to Tun Abdul Razak checkpoint... dropped off and had my passport stamped, then got on again. The bus was waiting for us, but don't know if this is routine or just because our dear driver went on another of his jaunts, to the loo this time, and again we sat there waiting for him for about 10 mins. And then who should come wandering up but the fella left behind at Gelang Patah; he got on but had lost his ticket, thus ensued a I-paid-No-you-did-not conversation betw him and the ticket inspector. I did see him get on and pay at Perling so I told the inspector so and he finally decided to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. I found out later that the poor fella, stranded at Gelang Patah, had actually caught a taxi to the Checkpoint to catch up with us (which totally defeats the purpose of taking the bus!).<br><br>After that the journey was smooth. Got off at Tuas CIQ and then on again; the bus waited for everyone, and on to Jurong East via AYE and Jurong Town Hall Rd. The actual travelling bits were great, smooth and quick; it's just the incessant waiting that spoils it. Nice view from the 2nd link too, keppel club is just so obvious.<br><br>The price is actually not bad (for my journey), considering that if I went by woodlands I'd have to take a bus from perling down to jb town, then 170/160/CW1 across to SG, which adds up more or less to RM3 anyway. Good for all those needing to go from Perling to Jurong East. I'm quite sure CW3 charges stepped fares, cos I've taken it from Perling to jb town and it's only RM1.90. Not sure about the frequency though; it was the first bus i saw when I arrived at the bus stop so i just got on (lucky me). From a chart on the bus should be one every 20 mins. No proper bus stop and signages in jb though; basically have to know where the bus stops and just stand by the road. The good thing is that in the residential areas the buses usually stop wherever you wave them down.<br></div>

It was evening peak or just after peak time i.e. 20:00 &amp; lanes of cars were jammed on 2nd Link towards Tuas CIQ complex.<br><br>I notice anytime @ Jurong East there's only 1 CW3 vehicle in the parking lot, which would take the next load to JB. I also saw 1 unit just left earlier. So these being the case, common sense would suggest if the 2nd Link commercial vehicle lanes were not moving fast enough or badly jammed, then there wouldn't be those 2 units coming &amp; going @ intervals not longer than during real off-peak time like 9 or 10 later in the evening ?! They not known to keep reserve CW3 vehicles in Singapore somewhere to come out during jam time ?!<br><br>What i can say is that fortunately the road design @ Tuas CIQ is overall better than @ Woodlands CIQ whereby the commercial vehicle lanes do not 'cross over' to the car lanes somewhere down the line i.e. commercial vehicles use the leftward lanes only meant for them while cars use the righter lanes. You don't tend to see that stupid situation @ Woodlands where the bus lane is clear &amp; car lanes choked up &amp; you're on a bus before the traffic junction prior to going up the ramp &amp; the bus cannot proceed simply because its path is blocked by cars &amp; lorries crossing over in front of the bus &amp; blocking it !!!!<br>2nd Link i find traffic is overall more orderly although sometimes can be congested so still higher chance the bus would keep moving into the complex while the cars remain stuck on the stupid bridge !<br><br>These jams i find to be a good showcase of Singaporean inefficentcy in that they have such a big presumbly large capacity modern (white elephant especially @ Tuas operating way below capacity) complex YET still so slow in processing !! All these excuses of 'security' i have to pass off as excuses that's about it because if you really think about it, what's the 'extra' things they do that others don't do that would result in overall so slow a clearance ?!!? The times spent to check passport &amp; vehicles, on per unit basis, i don't find much differences whether in Johor or Singapore side ! Yet the Malaysian side even if supposely 'inferior' run-down facilities almost always manage to clear faster. I'm very eager to use their brand-new CIQ complex opposite JBCS...that should show which side is more efficient in processing clearance ! The Johor CIQ complex appears lower capacity than the big Tuas CIQ complex (with many unused lanes etc.) so understandably should be more congested than Tuas sometimes. I find the Johor side somewhat 'under designed' their CIQ while the Singapore side 'over designed' theirs ! But on overall perception of clearance &amp; facilities utlilsation efficientcy, the Malaysian side i see clearly performs better.<br><br>Whether SBST 160 faster also depends on where one is heading from Jurong East.

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on nett driving time (when i took CW3 to SGP) from Perling Mall to Jurong East should between 50 min. to not &gt; 1 hour. So if 1.5 hours that means 30 mins. is the 'excess fat' that HI have to trim off in order to bring the service to its optimal level of performance, i'll say ! They ready need to find ways to trim off that 'extra' 30 mins. ! The most tolerable would be say 10 mins. extra for a quick detour into &amp; out of Gelang Patah station i.e. 5 mins. from highway to that station &amp; vice-versa back to highway with just circling once round the station to check if anyone boarding from there then go off. Based on my return trip from SGP when CW3 detoured to GP station i noted nett driving time from highway to that station only ~ 5 mins. per way.<br><br>This idea of waiting @ Gelang Patah station is plain stupid !<br>I won't mind it so much if it's only stopover to pickup/dropoff passengers &amp; even if need to switch bus, least they must have the connecting vehicle ready to go &amp; waiting instead for the incoming bus such that it's a smooth &amp; quick transfer for the passengers without this stupid wait onboard.<br><br>Wonder why the transfer point changed to Gelang Patah station instead of Johor CIQ ?? Because no parking space @ Johor CIQ to park only 2 buses &amp;/or due to more toll expenses due to 2 buses instead of 1 going to &amp; leaving there ?? Toll charges maybe but parking space should not be a problem since the CIQ area is so big !<br><br>If it's due to insufficient vehicles available &amp;/or insufficient passenger loading per vehicle, then they might as well lower the frequency say to 1 or even 2 hours per bus ?!? It boils down to a matter of time planning for the passengers i'll say because if they reduce the frequency as such BUT ensure that vehicles come &amp; go punctually (within slight tolerable time differences say +/- 15 mins.)<br>then the passengers can also plan their activties to suit their schedules.<br><br>Nowadays with many people having handphones with SMS, perhaps HI can even send SMS of latest updated next vehicle arrival times to interested regular customers so to minimise on any misses &amp; further unnecessary waiting as such if lower frquencies are used ?!<br><br>They should also do headcount of passengers alighting @ CIQ's to ensure noone left out before driving off, just as practised by the outstation coaches from MY to SGP. Of course in exceptional cases with only 1 or 2 passengers delayed @ CIQ (for longer than say 5 mins.) then some understanding would be appreciated from these people to take the next bus so that the majority are not made to wait for a few. Doing headcount would also ensure no need to wait for say 10 mins. @ CIQ before driving off because as long as everybody back onboard no more reason to wait.<br><br>Those 10 passengers to SGP, how many already onboard when you boarded @ Perling ? 10 appears quite ok to me considering it's off-peak &amp; during other off-peak times i've noted typically 5 arriving @ Jurong East.<br><br>As for taxis, i don't think currently there's any taxi which plies the 2nd Link ?<br><br>Bus-stops in JB (or i believe in MY as a whole) are both visible &amp; invisible !!<br>The visible ones you can see so it's more obvious. The invisible ones tend to be those where you see a group of people always standing @ the same spot.<br>In SGP it seems only the Bus Plus &amp; private operators use invisible bus-stops as well.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kharim11:</div><div class="quote_body">Hah, just got back from johor.<br><br>Took CW3 from johor (perling mall) to Jurong east.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>You seem confused yourself because you start by asking where have 'bus lane' in 2nd Link then next line you say people use the 'bus lane' in 2nd Link !?!<br><br>If you read carefully my posts (my writing tends to be more precise instead of vague) you'll note that nowhere e.g. have i said of the existence of 'bus lanes' like the type you see in CBD etc. with road markings in yellow colour.<br>BUT what i ever said is that @ Tuas CIQ the commercial vehicle lanes (so this implies lanes for PSV's like buses &amp; coaches besides goods vehicles) on the left side while those for cars on the righter side ! As such there's NO sharing of lanes between cars &amp; buses when they enter the CIQ complex area. Same also @ Woodlands CIQ complex.<br><br>I find the road layout on 2nd Link @ Tuas CIQ better than on Causeway which results in much less chances of e.g. cars &amp; lorries criss-crossing the path of buses &amp; coaches which also means you don't get that stupid situation like an empty lane for buses on the ramp leading to the CIQ complex with the car &amp; truck lanes left to it jammed up BUT no bus can manage to use the empty lane simply because their path are blocked by vehicles criss-crossing from the right side over to the left !!!! Of course too the yellow box is normally ignored when the traffic gets heavy on the Causeway, which adds to the buses inability to use the empty lane meant for them !<br><br>On the 2nd Link however, due to the better road layout before reaching the Tuas complex such a stupid situation far LESS if not NIL chances of happening !<br><br>Of course on the 2nd Link bridge highway itself, cars can wander about from leftmost to rightmost lane while approaching the CIQ complex &amp; as such momentarilly cutting into the path of buses &amp; trucks etc. who normally stick to the more left lane in preparation to enter the commercial vehicles lane @ Tuas CIQ complex.<br><br>You're of course wrong by saying i've never seen 2nd Link jammed up, simply because i've ever seen it before, while taking CW3 towards Johor ! On the day of my trip, the CW3 buses came &amp; left Jurong East terminal as usual while the Tuas CIQ arrival side was jammed with cars spread over many lanes ! CW3 buses not known to reach JE via any other way from Johor.  I've also mentioned it in another post in this forum maybe under another topic.<br><br>Coaches still do use the Causeway but not as often as before if i suppose they know the Johor CIQ for coach passengers up the ramp is experiencing heavy traffic already since tour coaches do not tend to use the same lane below as the regular public buses. On Woodlands CIQ ramp, i've seen (occasionally though) cars even trucks straying onto the lane for buses trying to jump queue, only to be horned away by approaching bus/coach !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sbst275:</div><div class="quote_body">2nd Link jam where got bus lane one? You have never seen 2nd Link jammed situation. Dun share? You know ppl @ 2nd Link use the 'bus lane' to cut into and there are 4 lanes instead of the 3 indicated on the road lane marking?<br><br>As for WDL, there was NO tour bus using WDL Checkpoint. Neither was there any car using the bus lane</div></blockquote></div>
