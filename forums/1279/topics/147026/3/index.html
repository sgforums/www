            <div class='col-md body'>I've not heard of any such poor after-sales service between SBST &amp; Daimler.<br>But i do believe C&amp;C M-B in Singapore thinks that their (i.e. C&amp;C M-B) pre-sales service is better than the after-sales service !<br><br>Anycase, i also do believe nowadays Daimler is more 'busy' serving the Malaysian market than Singapore. Maybe they're learning something from MAN i.e. since the Singapore market is so small &amp; especially with SBST already 'pre-occupied' with Volvo (since Delgro is Volvo's distributor here) Daimler might as well focus more on Malaysia instead !!<br><br>I observe the newer generation of air-suspended charged-cooled M-B's are becoming popular in Malaysia in the last few months. Transtar, HI &amp; now Nadi (Transnational) seem the larger Malaysian operators buying them in larger volume. I sense in Singapore there's 'something in the pipeline' but it seems to be a private transport operator buying instead, prefering the M-B's over Scania ! But volume-wise Daimler can expect to sell more in Malaysia than Singapore with the long term sales potential seeming better than in Singapore.<br><br>BTW, anyone taken any photos of the dashboard instrumentation panel of these new M-B's used by HI &amp; Transnational ?? I don't think they are Travegos in bus-chassi form eventhough the LCD/LED panel with twin-circular dials look similar to the Travego's. But the 'eye lid' part seems taken from the O 405 !<br>Rest seems brand-new in design &amp; styling.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iveco:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm, I overheard in ShoutBox last month that SBST &amp; Daimler-Chrysler had some kind of dispute regarding poor after-sales service.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I've found the model for our Mercedes bus. It is either a CBC 1725 or an IBC 1632. I think it is the 1725 (17 000 kg GVW, 250 hp. Just nice!)
