Because no parking space @ Johor CIQ to park only 2 buses &amp;/or due to more toll expenses due to 2 buses instead of 1 going to &amp; leaving there ?? Toll charges maybe but parking space should not be a problem since the CIQ area is so big !<br><br>If it's due to insufficient vehicles available &amp;/or insufficient passenger loading per vehicle, then they might as well lower the frequency say to 1 or even 2 hours per bus ?!? It boils down to a matter of time planning for the passengers i'll say because if they reduce the frequency as such BUT ensure that vehicles come &amp; go punctually (within slight tolerable time differences say +/- 15 mins.)<br>then the passengers can also plan their activties to suit their schedules.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yeah, man... the only reason I join this forum was to look for an outlet to vent my anger &amp; frustrations abt CW3 stopping @ Gelang Patah!!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, i consider this forum as some electronic paperless newspaper forum.<br>Therefore in this day &amp; age, i'll reasonably expect people to be aware of its contents without the need to trouble myself to go any further to reach them.<br><br>I notice this forum is not as 'obscure' as i initially thought it to be. Because<br>assuming you're someone who didn't know this forum existed, all you can do is to enter a search parameter like 'CW3 Jurong East-Kota Raya' or something  similar &amp; the search engines would lead ultimately to the posts in this forum !<br><br>I do believe that Handal Indah is somehow aware of the need for improvements which must be implemented in time to come in order to keep their customers &amp; get new ones as well. A basic difference i'll say between operating a transport outfit in Singapore &amp; Malaysia is the big differences in the areas to cover literally, which puts far greater strain on scare resources &amp; also makes things more difficult to manage, compared to operating on a smaller area where everything is nearer &amp; easier to monitor etc.<br><br>Big boss of HI known to be in the bus bodybuilding industry for some time till 1 day he was approached by someone in Malaysia who proposed to him to start a transport service to link MY &amp; SGP. I suppose he being a Malaysian Chinese businessman, he then took it as an opportunity to serve the community this way &amp; raising their material well-being same time by providing vehicles of a grade never before existed in MY &amp; even SGP.<br><br>Somehow i see some parallel between TIBS &amp; HI not only in the brand of vehicles &amp; seats used &amp; colour of vehicles but also in the broader corporate vision towards striving towards new levels of standards in omnibus transport here. Among the various operators in JB now, i'll consider HI as the premier operator there, in terms of both the hardware &amp; service !<br><br>I even consider Handal Indah as the Lavender (confectionary business) in the transport services sector in MY. Notice how outstanding the quality of their concept &amp; service is compared to the rest (even long standing ones) there !<br><br>As for use of SMS, i find that MY seems more advanced in innovative uses of such new technology compared to SGP. Look @ live video broadcasting of TV programs like news on handphones from DiGi, offered @ a time when no phone operator seems to offer it in SGP yet ! For me, i use 2 handphones (1 MY &amp; 1 SGP based) so i'm able to 1st hand sense the superior cost:benefit ratio &amp; the more advanced level of sophistication from the MY operator over the SGP one i happen to use !! So i'm not surprised if such SMS notification services be available in MY before even being talked about or heard of in SGP.<br><br>From my most recent trip on CW3 to Johor from Jurong East, i notice<br>the Tuas CIQ processing was more inefficiently slow than usual that the bus driver even fell asleep while waiting for people to return ! 10 minutes longer than normal wasted @ Tuas as such. The 2 counters usually opened in the largely under-used complex were lined with almost 1 bus-length of people each row when we arrived yet they can't be bothered to open just 1 more counter for a few minutes to separate the processing from the slower 'tourist' crowd there !! The ticket inspector did headcount before waking up the driver to move off. Upon reaching Gelang Patah the transfer was the quickest so far i've experienced on CW3 i.e. within 5 minutes all passengers from the incoming CW3 transferred onto either another CW3 or 666 &amp; both left that station ! I notice now they have a short 'shuttle bus' plying between Bukit Indah &amp; Gelang Patah station, likely an M-B OF chassi like that used in 112.<br><br>The quick 5 mins. transfer @ Gelang Patah was however 'compensated' by much slower 'tortise crawling' on the expressways later where instead of the usual 110+ km/h, the bus was only dragging along @ around 75 km/h only &amp; overtaken all over by other vehicles while the driver seemed distracted by a SFO (small flying object) inside the bus which he can't get rid off !! So it was a rather impatient slow ride (for me) all the way to Bukit Indah in fact all the way to JBCS, where i ended my 'test ride'. Hope that's strictly exceptional rather the norm ! Therefore overall time from Jurong East to Wong Ah Fook that afternoon barely below 2 hours, longer than my previous rides !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">Haha!

Therefore under those circumstances, it's justifiably practical if not even  necessary for the drivers to release the impatient passengers so that least overall human traffic flow does not come to a dead stop just because of vehicle jams ! Those walking hence don't need to waste more time waiting till when ?! They also have alternative choices of transport once they leave the CIQ complex.<br><br></div></blockquote>You are not a driver...

But speaking of public transportation, in terms of reliability, consistency, efficiency &amp; punctuality, it still seems like a real struggle on M'sia side. I know it's not right to say that in SG (whether it's SBST or TIBS), that the service quality is near perfect, but we can't deny that overall, it's a far more pleasant experience compared to M'sia.

That of course, would boil down to the leadership.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, in terms of service quality, generally speaking, public transport in SGP has the edge over that in MY. But i attribute that firstly to the fact that compared to MY, SGP really has no choice but to jackup the standard in public transport as unlike in MY or many other countries with plenty of land, those there not happy with public transport there can take the relatively cheap &amp; easy way out by buying their own car. This unfortunately tends not so likely in SGP due to the perpetually much higher costs of cars here. My stand has always been that the Government here owes it to the people to provide a top class transport system since the alternative of cheap private cars would never tend to materialise given the land shortage problem in SGP. Secondly, when it comes to managing almost anything SGP, due to the much smaller size over MY, i consider has the 'natural' advantage in that it'll always tend to be easier to manage a small plot of land over a much bigger one. In MY, due to the vastness of the country, it would always remain more challenging to run almost anything there compared to in SGP. More manpower, more delegation, more need for competent top management etc.<br><br>Therefore taking into account the more challenging environment in MY due to the lesser physical proximity, the far more competitive environment among bus operators in MY, amongst various other resource constrains etc., my impressions of HI so far, from its performance in operating CW 1 &amp; 2 over the past year &amp; now CW3 so far, is still overall on the favourable side of things.<br><br>I notice that HI pays its staff like drivers a fixed salary [which i consider a good thing eventhough it means the company may have to take a higher risk in so doing in case the revenue not as high as expected etc.] compared to some other MY operators where it tends to be too profit oriented to the extent that those other operator's drivers overtake others to fight for passengers (like some taxi drivers) or refuse to pick up certain passengers etc. because their salaries tend to be tied very directly to the day's revenue !! So far i've not encountered such undesirable behavior from HI's drivers, which i have to regard as among the better ones in MY as a whole ! If you read some of my other posts in this forum, you'll should be able to understand why i hold such impressions.<br><br>I've even enough confidence to predict better things to from HI in time to come. To my mind, HI has embarked on something which is most unlikely that it would lose or want to give up on.<br><br>This idea of mine of SMS info service on demand of EAT for interested regular passengers, is of course only an idea for now &amp; may not even be eventually needed if other solutions are deemed sufficient to make their service reliable &amp; prompt enough. Implementing such a facility is of course more easily said than done, as with almost anything else in such a much bigger country compared to in SGP.<br><br>As regards serving the market, i'll put it that firstly, the company must be able to find it financially viable to exist &amp; run the services. Having advanced beyond this 'basic corporate need', then it can look into the more qualitative aspects of service excellence &amp; customer care etc. If there's not enough money to even 'eat' in the 1st place, then not realistic to expect it to provide anything more.<br><br>As for judgement on CW3 service levels, i'll consider it highly premature to jump to conclusions of HI's inability to perform satisfactorilly simply because it's charting new territory since it's closest 'ex-competitor' [Maju on route 262] didn't go to Jurong East. In situations like these, i not surprised even HI themselves right now are still doing various trial &amp; error fine-tuning of their operational logistics as noone in the history of SGP &amp; MY has ever operated Jurong East to Kota Raya or Larkin public bus service before CW3 existed.<br>Therefore i'll reserve any perceptions of sloppiness say to the day when there's another operator plying exactly the same route since it's only then that one can really gauge if 1 operator is more sloppy over another etc. as an apple to apple to comparison always tends to be more accurate than apple to say orange comparison.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah, I agree with you on that too.

End up passengers standing along Tmn Perling &amp; Bkt Indah will hv to wait for the next bus that comes 20mins later, causing us to feel anxious because the bus which we usually board at a particular time did not turn up. It has happened a few times before and this morning was another classic example. And to think that some of the HI drivers at GP were quite surprised how come the bus that picked us ALL up were pretty packed, which was not the norm. I overheard their conversation. Staff A asked our driver "Wah, so many people. Where are they from huh? Bkt Indah izzit?" Our driver answered, "No, these are the ones I picked up who were supposed to board the bus prior to mine..."<br><br>It's funny how come the staff @ Gelang Patah didn't realise why there was no local bus from Kotaraya coming in to fill up the 1st bus departing for S'pore at 6.30am today?? I bet the 1st bus that left for JE (no. plate 3105) was very empty this morning because the only ones who managed to hop onto it were the ones who drove to GP. And none of the HI staff sensed something was wrong??? I believe they knew..... but again, not sure what to do.... just pretend it's okay.</div>
