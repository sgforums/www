Not much practical point to me, only aesthetical !<br><br>In TIBS case, i believe back in 2000 when the Habit was launched here, they probably found the O 405 GN too expensive so decided to stick with O 405 G while the habit body may have been done with O 405 GN in mind instead. So Hispano might have then simply 'blanked out' the excess glass area as the O 405 G is only a normal 3-step low floor citybus &amp; not ultra-low floor with zero steps.<br><br>Anyway, this black glass effect only makes the bus appear lower than it actually is during daytime only, because during nitetime with the interior lights on the higher actual height of the window stills become so obvious that it's a normal higher height bus.<br><br>As to no low floor buses in Malaysia, i don't think so.<br>What's low floor in the 1st place ? I consider the O 305, O 405, N113, Lance etc. as low floor citybuses as the step count @ normal step height does not exceed 3 steps. Ultra low floor those with zero step or just 1 step from the road to get in. Anything &gt; 3 steps @ normal step height (like the OF &amp; OH series etc.) these then are not low floor vehicles.<br><br>For a bus to be classified as a (purpose built) citybus, the basic requirement is low floor as mentioned above. Low profile tyres too i'll say. Higher height buses used as citybuses are NOT real citybuses as such &amp; should not technically be classified as such.<br><br>The 1st low floor bus in Malaysia i'll consider as the MAN SL 252, with roughly similar dimensions as the M-B O 405, both of which ARE purpose built citybuses &amp; the 3-step floor low enough to be classified as a low floor bus. It's of course NOT ultra low floor though since there's &gt; 1 step onboard from the road !<br><br>As for HI's new M-B like those with the kampung roof bodywork &amp; that unit shown in your photo, the floor height is low enough &amp; step count &amp; step height all low enough to be classified as a low floor hence 'real' citybus chassis. Of course NOT ultra low floor though. Same as with the O 405 G with Habit bodywork here. Not surprising then to note of M-B's new model normenclarature like CBC, which stands for 'citybus chassis' while IBC for 'intercity bus chassis' etc.<br><br></div></blockquote>So HseoChin,Im MY Those Dennis Dart/Lances,MAN SL252 &amp; Scanias are considered low floor with steps right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not just in MY, even in 1st world countries in Europe the criteria for classification as low floor bus is the height of the floor from the road i.e. must not &gt; than certain preset guideline limit. How many steps or height of each step needed to reach the floor height from the road then becomes of secondary importance. Another criteria is the height of the 1st step from the road, which depends on the tyre size used i.e. whether it's low profile citybus tyres or not.<br><br>Those with even lower floor heights then considered as ultra low floor buses, which have become more popular in recent years in Europe &amp; slowly in SGP.<br>Few days ago i was walking along Jalan Pudu in KL, noted they also have citybus with 2 shallow steps, like some in JB. Those i defintely classifly as low floor although not ultra low floor.<br><br>The higher floor height bus-chassi seems cheaper so that should explain why the majority of buses in MY used as citybuses are not 'purpose built' citybuses yet.<br><br>M-B O 405, O 405 G, MAN SL 252, Scania N113, Dennis Lance/Dart are low enough to be 'entry level' low floor buses.

[But due to it's lousy suspension ride comfort, there's many other better choices around still]<br><br>Some drivers may like the B10M due to the weight distribution being more in front (because the engine is quite close upfront) which can provide more steering traction especially in wet weather driving. But what's appealing to the driver need NOT be appealing to the passengers, who tend to be more concerned about the suspension ride comfort especially those seated @ the extreme rear who WILL find the B10M terribly uncomfortable (for an air-suspended bus !) even @ slower road speeds.<br><br>In overview i consider the B10M below the 'entry level' low floor category (which those like O 405, N113 belong to) i.e. B10M not low enough to consider as a low floor bus although when compared to OF or OH series, B10M lower in floor height than these due to the horizontally mounted engine. That's why i say B10M 'in the middle of nowhere' ! In modern times, not a model of bus or coach worth considering anymore.<br><br></div></blockquote>Seriously say,Those B10Ms are not suitable for modern days citybuses!If given a choices,Then i would definately choose MAN SL252 OR Even Dennis Lance in addition to O 405 &amp; N113CRBs fleets.(I don't understand why they prefer B10Ms over Lances which is similiar in prices <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of distance (i.e. how many km ?) what's the respective route distance for CW3 &amp; SBST 160 ?? Take that divided by time taken get average travelling speed, in order to better gauge who's faster.<br><br>If CW3's route distance is longer (i.e. they serve a wider area) then even if their time taken is longer, overall it'll still be inconclusive if they are really slower. Comparing apples with oranges, the conclusions would never be too reliable ! As i've mentioned in previous posts, i consider CW3 not being in direct competition with SBST 160, just close competition only since they don't use exactly the same route, hence they don't serve exactly the same market.<br><br>Nevertheless, i'm curious to find out myself who's faster just from Kota Raya to Jurong East Interchange &amp; by what time difference &amp; also the quality of vehicles used by HI in CW3 besides the fares.<br><br>If the fare is only S$ 3 then i'll find it reasonable since SJE is charging S$ 2.40 &amp; you get lousy old MAN's quite often ! If HI's fleet is 100 % brand-new air-suspended charged-cooled M-B's or close to that, then 60 cents extra is definitely worthwhile for a better class of travelling experience !<br>SBST 160 ? i won't bother to mention it again. Yes their fare is lower BUT by how much only ?? The most by S$ 1.50 ? You save only around there but end up in some old Volvo B10M Mk.3 only with their famous lousy suspension ride comfort for say 1+ hour journey ?!?? Based on their vehicles used, i'll put it the most @ 50:50 SBST's competitive appeal for someone going from JEI to Kota Raya or vice-versa.<br><br>It's something like you choose between a modern M-B taxi or a old lousy non M-B taxi with a some fare &amp; time difference, the cheaper &amp; lousier vehicle then becomes NOT automatically the prefered choice !<br><br>I agree with you though on that unless you're in the Western region of Singapore going to JB, CW3 would tend to be less attractive then.

I'll give it a shot this weekend. For a citybus chassis, I find it interesting that it was fitted with a manual transmission (going retro, perhaps?). I thought it was automatic. Which makes me wonder, is it the same type of chassis as the ones used for the Causeway Link Express?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>No, i don't use '!' to show anger as i'm basically not an angry person !<br>My style of using this '!' rather is to draw attention or emphasize certain areas which i sense people tend to ignore or overlook so as to draw their attention to take note of something. Got the idea of using '!' this way from the exclamation mark symbol used in the vehicle breakdown warning triangle. Just 1 of my style of expression. You don't have to like it, agree with it, or read it.<br><br>Well, i agree that to many a 'normal' person i.e. not a bus or coach related researcher, engineer or enthuisast, these people would find all engine sounds boring because they don't have the passion to go for those things as their interest lie elsewhere !<br><br>Just like if you try to tell me about warships, fighter aircraft or battle tanks i'll most certainly go to sleep instead, or play my audio recording of bus engine sounds which i recorded as far back as 15 years ago. But i know there's quite some people with interests in those above mentioned things which i don't &amp; vice-versa.<br><br>As for not caring about technical details of the buses they use, i understand because not many of them have the know-how to make sense of such details !<br>Yes, SJE still get almost full-load on their lousy old MAN's sometimes but that's when those commutors don't see another superior model coming behind yet &amp; they don't know when that's coming &amp; don't always want to wait so they just put up with what's there then. I've been thru those situations many times especially when i'm in a hurry so i can understand. BUT the interesting thing will be that if there's a better model parked next to a lousier one somehow i observe even such 'normal' persons seemingly ignorant about technical stuff would tend to know how to board the better model !<br><br>I recall some 13 years ago when i was working in Sumitomo in Jurong here.<br>The factory chartered private buses to transport its staff to various regions on this island. Those days the OH 1318 was still very new here &amp; to my surprise &amp; agreement, i even came across 1 housewife type production worker who spoke out that she prefered that model over another Hino. All she seemed to able to say was 'that one better' &amp; that she looked forward to taking that bus again.<br>So that's tells me that out there, there's seems a silent majority of such 'normal' people who may not know much of the technical aspect of bus engineering etc., yet these people know how to go for a better model, but only when they see 1 available next to another. Otherwise, they just put up with what's on the table till the next time the better 1 comes along ! That's the mentality i observe applicable elsewhere too, like with SJE @ Ban San terminal.<br>If i'm @ Jurong East Interchange say &amp; waiting for route 105 &amp; there's O 405 &amp; B10M available, i'll prefer to take the O 405 but if the B10M starts to go 1st, then i might just put up with it if i'm more in a hurry, sort of thing.<br><br>Talking about fastness, based on my travel experience with CW3, i'll put it ~ 40 mins. between Taman Bukit Indah &amp; Jurong East Interchange under normal traffic. The passenger loading from Singapore direction seemed higher than from Johor direction towards Singapore. If going by other ways (i.e. non CW3) then typically it takes 40 mins. between Kota Raya &amp; Bukit Indah alone + the time taken to Kota Raya from Jurong East Interchange via Causeway, which is more prone to jams than 2nd Link. So in such situations, CW3 can be faster towards Johor Baru from Jurong East.<br><br>Interesting to see the effect of the Causeway jams on the passenger loading for CW3. HI has a potentially good trump card with CW3, especially when the new administrative region in Johor is ready &amp; more activity shifts there from the over congested JB bandar area. Also the availability of many new houses in Bukit Indah &amp; Bandar Nusajaya &amp; nearby regions there will indirectly create more demand for quicker access to Singapore without going thru the famous Causeway bottleneck !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alex_cai92:</div><div class="quote_body">aiyo, will a normal person care how the engine sounds like...to them all are boring....and they dun care so much about the details and technical side....as long as they tink tat it is fast can liao.....altough SJE uses lousy MAN buses, but they still gt plenty of commuters....<br><br>and can u stop putting so many !!! question marks in ur posts...it makes u sound as if u r very angry and work up and makes reading uncomfortable...</div></blockquote></div>
