            <div class='col-md body'>I do observe many passengers nowadays do pay attention to the model of vehicle, just that they don't have the 'know-how' to articulate their preferences. I'll say they appear to not care what model quite simply because<br>they know for certain routes e.g. only certain models are allocated to serve that route so choices can be limited to them &amp; they end up blindly taking what comes along !<br><br>But when you have a situation (like SJE &amp; CW2) where much is the same &amp; only the models deployed differ, then i've consistently observed that there's quite some people who would stay behind &amp; let others behind the queue board 1st &amp; they patiently wait for the next bus who turns out to be the preferred model !<br>I myself of course also do that..as long as i'm not in too much hurry &amp; can wait a little more if i see e.g. the OH 1627 L coming in a distance behind &amp; just let the MAN go !<br><br>As the population living standards &amp; individual material expectations rises (which would also have to include the quality of buses they use &amp; by which the models tend to be quite an accurate gauge as such !) i do believe a growing silent majority in Singapore (maybe not yet in Malaysia) do pay attention to the bus model they use, just that there may be limited avenues for them to select which they prefer so they just put up with whatever that's there only !<br><br>Similar observation in taxis, i note !!<br>I've seen (more than a few times) people who would ignore which taxi is in front of a taxi queue &amp; prefer to take their prefered taxi behind the queue or another who just happen to drive by ! Not every time you'll meet up with a preferred driver &amp; the vehicles are all air-conditioned nowadays (although many other details differ which comes about from the differences in the vehicle) so it boils down largely to the difference in model/make of vehicle which causes the commutor to prefer 1 over another.<br><br>As for driver's customer service quality, of course that's important.<br>But from using public buses in Singapore for many years, i don't find many drivers more outstanding than the rest so as a commutor, the driver is just another 'item' like air-con whereby people take air-con over non air-con etc.<br>Most drivers seem the 'same' &amp; they should be as otherwise they wouldn't have been hired if they don't make the grade to be driver !<br>Talking about air-con, there's time (during night) where people can actually prefer non air-con to aircon.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by carbikebus:</div><div class="quote_body">Well majority passengers don't heck care whatever model they deployed as long there are buses running around,Air-Conditioned and most important is the Driver's customer service skills(Bonus) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Period!</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose they can go to ~ 85 km/h if 'pushed'.<br><br>But those sitting behind won't have a very comfortable ride, mainly due to the relatively poor suspension ride comfort which gives quite sharp spine jarring 'pokes' from one's backside even when going over rough patches of roads with potholes @ much slower speeds ! Among SBST, TIBS, SJE &amp; HI, i can't think of another model of bus presently in service with ride as lousy as the B10M (all Mks.) ! I notice (among the B10M's only) the Mk2 is slightly more comfortable with less such hard shocks even @ the extreme rear. I suspect SBST knows about their poor ride &amp; thus i've observed a few Mk4 with much 'softer' suspension BUT these few are grossly overdone, unfortunately. I can sense the efforts made to try to emulate the standard on the O 405 but have to conclude so far it's an 'overkill' because whenever it bounces up it takes too long a time to settle down again i.e. too long to damp !, unlike the O 405 where the damping is so well coordinated that it offers almost just the precise combination of damping efficacy versus the ability to absorb the road shocks !<br><br>Those sitting in the middle &amp; front regions of the B10M may not be so prone to such discomfort BUT the drawback here is the relatively noisy &amp; vibrasive engine of the Mk3 which seems only slightly lower in NVH over the Mk2 with the Mk4 the lowest among the B10M's here.<br><br>In all the other models of bus used by the above 4 operators the suspension is far more comfortable irrespective of location inside. The most comfortable region being around the front axle region, where the engine is furthest away behind &amp; hence being able to get a quieter less vibrasive more comfortable ride the same time. Also they just as fast if not faster &amp; accelerate quicker too !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sbst275:</div><div class="quote_body">Some MK3 can chiong like siao</div></blockquote></div>

(Sounds a bit confusing and ridiculous, but most bus drivers followed the rule strictly) That's why those buses stopped for a long time opposite City Square.

            <div class='col-md body'>I won't mind saying openly i do have preference for M-B over most others,<br>because of it's history, achievements, global ranking in the omnibus industry,<br>but most importantly to me, all the overall positive experiences i've so far had from using their vehicles over the last 30 years.<br><br>I don't 'blindly' select M-B over others though. I do have high regard for certain models from other makes as well.<br>There's 1 M-B model currently in use here which i honestly have to condemn, so much so i've even communicated my extreme displeasure to the makers in writing &amp; of such to date they've apparently 'taken it all in' &amp; not given any 'rationale' for the existence of that model. I do believe if there's indeed 'no substance' in my feedback they would not likely have 'kept quiet' ! Fortunately the operator only has maybe 3 or 4 of that model in its fleet &amp; i notice that model not very well received in Malaysia as well, say the least !!<br><br>The problem with choosing the bus which looks 'nicest' is that it can be very superficial just like judging a book only by its cover !! The bus-chassis is like the pages of literary content inside a book while the cover is like the bus body only ! It's fine if such a 'book cover' &amp; the contents within it are done to the same exacting standards BUT the state of the bus industry here is such that they cut-corners by not sourcing the 'book covers' from the same source as the rest of the contents within it so to an observant mind, the disparity in quality is obvious 'inconsistent' &amp; 'unreliable to accept' !<br><br>Take KKKL's coaches e.g. to get some idea of what i mean.<br>The coachwork in their case can be way above-average in finishing, style<br>i.e. looks quite nice overall BUT when the vehicle starts moving then you'll sense the negative other side of the vehicle as a whole !<br><br>I of course ever selected KKKL as it appeared 'nice' as mentioned above BUT when the journey ended i got off their vehicle with very negative overall impressions largely because of things about it which cannot be seen but sensed instead which turned out most disappointing !<br><br>In Singapore currently only TIBS buses (not all but most) are of overall (i.e. chassi &amp; body) of basically acceptable standards to me. As for much of the rest here, only the bus-chassi part is commendable while the body part simply doesn't measure up because the 2 not up to the same standards !!<br><br>It appears to me many people in this part of the world have still 'not arrived' to a class which can appreciate &amp; hence go for makes like Setra, Neoplan &amp; of course, the M-B integral class of buses &amp; coaches !!<br>They still seem stuck in the M-B &amp; various other makes bus-chassis class only !<br><br>I envision good long term potential for improvements overhauling such mindsets as such.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alex_cai92:</div><div class="quote_body">from all your post, i see that u really really favour MB alot.....anyway, replying to the last few posts, i think most ppl will choose the bus which look 'nicest', as they tink nice so it looks good, so it looks new, so it is good.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to start off, this is Singapore not say Malaysia or some other less developed country with plenty of land for many cars &amp; where private cars are cheap &amp; whereby people who don't like the quality of service in the public transport can take the cheap &amp; easy way out &amp; buy their own car !!<br><br>That is the situation i'll say in Malaysia but certainly NO longer the case in Singapore ! What does this mean for the future of transport within Singapore ??<br><br>To me it means simply that the quality of public transport in Singapore cannot be anything less than 1st class, now &amp; into the future, seriously speaking !<br>Otherwise, how to best 'compensate' people here for foregoing the benefits of having their own private car &amp; the use of it ?<br><br>There's been plenty of talk in recent years about getting more people to use more public transport &amp; less private car transport in Singapore. The key appeal of a private car comprises not just door-step convinence, but also the comfort issue etc. Therefore, to best emulate the private car, the public transport vehicles have to also pay attention to not just reliability, which is 'basic' &amp; 'understood' pre-requisite but also equally important, in today's world &amp; into the future as well, the comfort issue as well !<br><br>Gone are the days where only reliability &amp; economy are important &amp; the other issues less important, or worse regarded as 'not important' !<br><br>Modern public transport vehicles in a place like Singapore have to score EQUALLY well not just in reliability, but also in the safety, performance &amp; comfort aspects ! No more &amp; certainly no less !! All have become of equal importance.<br><br>Therefore only the finest buses &amp; taxis in the world really do deserve a place in Singapore, not only due to the land shortage here but also because only the finest vehicles would best be able to emulate the appeal of a private car !!!!<br>Which in turn is the best chance of getting more people here to use public transport more &amp; private cars less, if @ all so as to achieve the objectives of reducing dependence on private car usage here due to land constrains.<br><br>My stand has always been that the people in Singapore do deserve THE best class of public transport here BUT only pay 'nominal' fares to use them, with the rich Government subsidizing the bulk of the costs ! Therefore the bus operators can then go for the best buses even if it's also the more expensive ones (unfortunately so) &amp; get the Government to help out with part of the costs such that even the toilet cleaner get the chance to ride in a top class bus or taxi &amp; pay not very different fares compared to in a lousier class of vehicle !<br><br>This is already happening i observe with the latest taxis here, which i find is a most welcome development. Nowadays here you flag down a taxi on the roadside, you roughly pay similar fares whether you ride in a modern top class taxi or a much lousier model ! In buses here too, i notice a similar situation, although the disparity is less obvious.<br><br>So that's the way to go ! One cannot afford to cut any more corners by going for 2nd or 3rd class vehicles anymore here. By the way, where did you get this impression that M-B spare parts cost double that of Volvo's ??!?? Overall i certainly do NOT consider it so, as otherwise the OMV of an M-B bus would also be double that of a Volvo, which cannot be so, for a similar GVW class of model of broadly similar specifications. You may be shocked to note there's even 1 model of M-B 16t GVW bus-chassi with air-suspension &amp; charged-cooled engine in-use here whose OMV is even lower than a Volvo or MAN, being around that of Dennis Lance only !!<br><br>Therefore in Singapore, it only makes sense to have as majority the best class of buses anywhere, with a smaller number of the cheaper &amp; not so good models to serve as some yardstick of comparison &amp; also in case 1 make goes on strike etc., then there's 1 or 2 other makes to fall back on. Issues like spare parts costs &amp; servicing costs etc. would have to take a backseat with the main priority increasing being doing the maximum possible (almost irregardless of cost !) to reduce the dependency on the private car here for as many people as possible.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by carbikebus:</div><div class="quote_body">True,But ever heard of the greatest engine built,the messier when comes to breakdown.I don't mean to go againts you but IF i'm the director for a public bus companies i will go for the cheaper but reliable buses more and a few top brand buses the second things UNless if i'm operating a sight-seeing coaches comapnies <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Same cases for SBST,They have the cash for purchasing more mercs but to think that the spare parts cost as much as twice than the Volvo fleets.Not to mention when it goes for major overhaul <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>
