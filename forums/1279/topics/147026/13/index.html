            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever Mr. Singh was so fed-up with, it was wrong of him to throw insults at the passengers. And itÂ’s not right of him to give such a lame excuse that drivers are throwing in the towel because theyÂ’re annoyed with our complaints. In first place, if their service had been satisfactory, we wouldnÂ’t have voiced anything negative. In fact, if it had been exceptionally good, weÂ’d have even heaped praises on CW3 and its fame would have spread far and wide.<br><br>I know when he said, Â“Sebab kamu tak faham masalah kami..Â”, he meant that many a times delay of buses is caused by events beyond their control like a massive traffic jam at the start of Tmn Perling, the bus broke down or had a tyre punctured, driver on MC, driver have to buka puasa, etc. etc. But thatÂ’s THEIR PROBLEMÂ… the management staff who run this businessÂ… werenÂ’t they taught in business school about MurphyÂ’s Law which says Â“If anything can go wrong, it will.Â”? These sort of problems are nothing new. In fact, the solutions should have been there even before the problem starts. The management should have come out with a better SOP (Standard Operational Procedure) in tackling all these foreseen hiccups.<br><br>Yesterday, the bus we boarded from JE was also the same bus that drove us back to Bkt Indah-Tmn Perling but the driver said heÂ’d drove up to Perling Mall only, then make a loop back to Gelang Patah. Yup, that should be it! That should be the way to do things... Thumbs up for that! CÂ’mon, if they already know full well thereÂ’s gonna be a heavy jam coming in to Tmn Perling from Bandar during the peak hour, then they should station one CW3 at Perling Mall beforehand. I donÂ’t see any harm or disadvantage in thatÂ… In fact, itÂ’s better that during peak hour they shorten the route for CW3, make it Perling Mall-Gelang Patah loop service.<br><br>And if knowing full well that buses may break down, then HI should ensure regular maintenance of its fleet. ItÂ’s just like the airplane. You canÂ’t afford to have it break down when itÂ’s already up there in the sky, right?<br><br><span style="color: brown;">What I cannot tolerate is when Mr. Singh said Â“Ini bukan salah kami dan bukan salah officeÂ…ini semua pasal kamu banyak sangat complainÂ…Â” With this kind of attitude, Â“Patutlah pekerja and syarikat masih mundurÂ…Â”</span><br><br>If Mr. Singh felt sandwiched between the management and the passengers, then there should be a better way to handle the pressure rather than throw it the people whoÂ’s paying his salary. Since our 3 dollar is peanut to him, then he should quit and go drive his taxi full-time!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think so... I think those of us who hv been woking in SG but living in JB have given in alot and hv learned to get used to the different working culture of both countries.<br><br>Concerning CW3, most of us passengers hv mellowed down a lot compared to the initial period where we really blew our top whenever there's no buses at GP in the morning. You can't blame us cos we had to get to work but were 30-45mins behind time. We're the ones who had to face our bosses' unhappy faces when we reach office.<br><br>But nowadays, passengers of CW3 are already familiar with its schedule as well as its temperaments. In the morning, we are getting pretty good at estimating the bus' arrival time. It's almost as if we have a certain telepathy with the bus. We know it's going to reach our bus stop either 10mins earlier or 10mins later. And if it doesn't appear, we know when the next one is coming &amp; how late we're going to be. It's the same thing with the buses that depart Jurong East in the evening. I've come to realise that it doesn't have a fixed time. It's all up to the time-keeper at the booth who's observing the crowd. He's the one giving orders to the drivers. Anyway, we've have learned to accept the fact that M'sian buses are so unique that they give us new adventures almost everyday...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I donÂ’t think MÂ’sian bus services are of lower standard. Hseochin always say compare apple with apple and orange with orange. In my opinion, MÂ’sian busses can do so much better because the resources and potential is thereÂ… but itÂ’s just that we donÂ’t see much improvement because the mentality of the people is very different. Singaporeans are kiasu, always want to be the best or number one and time is moneyÂ… but MÂ’sians are more relaxedÂ… to them thereÂ’s no need to hurryÂ… they are not mastered by time... as for money, well, what they can earn for the day is good enough... work and life is viewed from a different perspective. What is Â“successÂ” to a SÂ’porean chinese is not the same to a MÂ’sian bumiputera.<br><br>ItÂ’s a paradox. On one hand, we know we have to bear with things and get used to the seemingly lower standard of service but how can we not complain when we donÂ’t think itÂ’s justifiable to make us wait 30mins or more at GP. It was the same case again last night. Every time also like thatÂ… how can we not fed-up? We rush to JE to catch an earlier bus but ended up going home the same time with those who took the later bus. CÂ’mon, itÂ’s not as if HI is so poor that it does not enough buses or drivers. After all, the taukay Mr. Teo very kaya what, right? Can build such a big companyÂ… buy so many brand new buses, equipped with latest technology some moreÂ… but <strong>who cares how beautiful, how shiny, how cantik, how lawa, how advanced, how high-tech or how modern the buses are if the staff are pea-brained people</strong>? Even if thereÂ’re limited buses or drivers, itÂ’s all a matter of learning how to schedule buses in a wiser and more productive way. This is something I cannot understand why it cannot be done.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No real need to wonder about that, as comparing SBST 160 to CW1 is approx. enough 'valid' comparision since from Kranji to Kota Raya both operate on largely similar routes !<br><br>As i've mentioned to someone before in this forum, CW3 is 'uncharted territory' compared to CW1 &amp; CW2, where long established Singaporean competition exist.<br><br>CW1 &amp; 2, i personally observe, have overall done reasonably well &amp; i have to state their service level is not too different from the other operators plying roughly the same routes. Many times i've seen they are more prompt in showing up compared to the others ! Also their buses are the superior class of vehicle compared to those on SBST 160 &amp; 170 although still inferior compared to the finest models used by SJE.<br><br>Therefore going by the service levels from CW 1 &amp; 2, even if SBST say were currently operating the same route as CW3, i would overall NOT expect to see much improvements, if any.

The former probably exceeds 75 minutes only under very exceptional circumstances that do not appear more than a few times a month.  The latter, even with the usual congestion at Perling Interchange and the occasional jam along Jalan Skudai and Jalan Tun Abdul Razak, probably hardly exceeds 90 minutes.  If Handal Indah just wants to care about the convenience of terminal users, it just needs to assume a worst case traveling time y, which can be x + 20 minutes, and ensures a connecting bus is ready for departure since z, which may be x - 20 minutes.  The terminal departure time 0 has an absolute daily minimum (the start time of operation), and has a fixed gradient (depature internal/number of departures).  Just that these may require it to stay away from the "just-in-time" strategy that may not be very suitable for the current CW3 routes, and to deploy a few more buses.<br></div>

11<br>Biggest deviation of traveling time (maximum deviation accommodated) : 3<br>Rest time (rest time for driver and bus) : 1<br>Tolerance (wait time of the connecting bus for its latest arrival time and earliest arrival time of the "connected bus") : 5  (I think the value 1 also needs 6 buses)<br></pre></div><br><br>To convert the values above to minutes, just multiply it by 60 and then devide by

            <div class='col-md body'>My basic point is that from the demonstrated performance of operating CW1 &amp; CW2, it already gives a certain clear enough picture of the competence of the management via that from the other players also offering roughly similar routes.<br><br>Therefore it's the 'same brain' also running the CW3 route so it is most logically &amp; reasonably to be expected that any 'shortcomings' of the CW3 service (versus CW1 &amp; 2) would NOT in much likeihood be due to shortcomings in managing it but more due to other factors which even if the other players were to operate an identical route as them now, these other players would end up NOT performing any differently when faced with the same operational constrains.<br><br>Your solutions do seem much more easily said in theory than done in reality, however. I'm afraid the more difficult physical operating environment within Malaysia would continue to give any operator there some 'natural excuses' over any service shortcomings !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah, I ain't complainin abt CW1 / CW2.

Just because the landscape is different, doesn't mean that is an excuse to make us sit for 30mins almost every other evenings.</div></blockquote></div>

I have never boarded the first bus, but I heard the first bus to Jurong East departs from Gelang Patah at around 0600 or 0610.  So, the first CW3 and 666 from the town should reach Gelang Patah around 0545 till 0610.  It usually takes about 50 to 70 minutes to get from Gelang Patah to Jurong East Interchange.<br></div>
