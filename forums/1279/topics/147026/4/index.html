If the engine's are of different cc, the model # expected to be different.<br><br>I note both engines featured are of 4-valve head design i.e. both are 24 valve engines, which very much would account for the higher performance efficiency compared to the O 405, which only uses 2-valve head design.

In JB departure checkpoint, there's a big signboard written in Malay that says passengers are not allowed to purchase ticket inside or outside bus, by order of JB Mayor, but who cares about this rule? Most of CW1's passengers board the bus from JB checkpoint, only a handful of them board CW1 from the going-to-be-ghost-town Kotaraya Terminal. If CW1 follows the rule strict, their business will have to fold. On the other hand, if SBS follows the rule, CW1 will benefit, but I doubt SBS will do it.<br><br>In the competitive business world, they don't care who's right, they only care who's left.</div>

I've written @ quite some length why that is so on another post relating to similar feedback pertaining to SJE vehicles. Therefore i won't even consider it worth the bother to mention about anybody not complying with such 'artificial' requirements of questionable worth !<br><br>About the issue of standing passengers, sometimes people have simply got to be practical &amp; use their head instead of blindly following whatever they are supposed to have read, understood or signed ! In the real world out there almost anywhere, rules are really meant to be broken, but of course on a selective basis ! Why that's so simply because the power of the written word doesn't seem powerful enough to cover with 100 % satisfaction all the possible situations encountered in real life so selective judgement would ultimately still need to be used. Only a dumb nut would blindly apply rules without thinking simply they are 'rules' !!<br><br>Anycase from personal observations, this issue of standing passengers for the short stretch across the Causeway is practised not only on CW2 from time to time but also on SJE as well. Understandly so. Therefore no real justifications or point to make any fuss out of such technical breaches of legality.<br><br>The practical hence really more important &amp; worthwhile things which i'll be looking into in such situations instead would be like can the vehicles concerned take the additional load of passengers ? (answer: certainly no problems since the bus-chassi are of broadly similar specs !) Are there sufficient grip points provided by the bodybuilder such that even with some standing passengers all concerned can still manage to find something to hold securely onto inside the vehicle ? It's obvious to me there are some provisions for such requirements although understandly not as much as on a citybus body. So that'll be the limiting factor of the number of standing passengers in excess of those seated i'll say. So in all practicality, it definitelly is feasible for the vehicles to take in somewhat more than the no. of seated passengers but of course these are last resort measures only to be taken under non-normal operating circumstances !<br>If they are clever enough, i'm not surprised if they can get their lawyers to add in some such 'exceptional' clauses to cater to such occasional breaches !<br>A matter of how to play with words &amp; still get things done not incorrectly.<br><br>On the whole, i must say HI have done reasonably well not only in Singapore but also in Malaysia, where low load factors seem more prevalent than in Singapore, where competition is not as keen as in Malaysia ! As such, i won't even find it worth the bother to pick on such issues to talk about them, as from personal observations even SBST &amp; SJE while in Malaysia do not comply fully with the requirements there while the local vehicles there comply with ! I understand the constrians in the actual situations on the roads etc. as such i don't even find it worth the bother to pick on them too as such !!!!<br><br></div></blockquote>I tends to agreed with you on this,Imagine driving 60 km/h on expressways which can be very irritating at some times,I always drive exceed those speed limit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 'ultra low floor theme' that appears to me as to why both the Habit here &amp; HI's bodywork adopted this black glass section, so as to make the vehicle appear lower than it really is. Not much practical point to me, only aesthetical !<br><br>In TIBS case, i believe back in 2000 when the Habit was launched here, they probably found the O 405 GN too expensive so decided to stick with O 405 G while the habit body may have been done with O 405 GN in mind instead. So Hispano might have then simply 'blanked out' the excess glass area as the O 405 G is only a normal 3-step low floor citybus &amp; not ultra-low floor with zero steps.<br><br>Anyway, this black glass effect only makes the bus appear lower than it actually is during daytime only, because during nitetime with the interior lights on the higher actual height of the window stills become so obvious that it's a normal higher height bus.<br><br>As to no low floor buses in Malaysia, i don't think so.<br>What's low floor in the 1st place ? I consider the O 305, O 405, N113, Lance etc. as low floor citybuses as the step count @ normal step height does not exceed 3 steps. Ultra low floor those with zero step or just 1 step from the road to get in. Anything &gt; 3 steps @ normal step height (like the OF &amp; OH series etc.) these then are not low floor vehicles.<br><br>For a bus to be classified as a (purpose built) citybus, the basic requirement is low floor as mentioned above. Low profile tyres too i'll say. Higher height buses used as citybuses are NOT real citybuses as such &amp; should not technically be classified as such.<br><br>The 1st low floor bus in Malaysia i'll consider as the MAN SL 252, with roughly similar dimensions as the M-B O 405, both of which ARE purpose built citybuses &amp; the 3-step floor low enough to be classified as a low floor bus. It's of course NOT ultra low floor though since there's &gt; 1 step onboard from the road !<br><br>As for HI's new M-B like those with the kampung roof bodywork &amp; that unit shown in your photo, the floor height is low enough &amp; step count &amp; step height all low enough to be classified as a low floor hence 'real' citybus chassis. Of course NOT ultra low floor though. Same as with the O 405 G with Habit bodywork here. Not surprising then to note of M-B's new model normenclarature like CBC, which stands for 'citybus chassis' while IBC for 'intercity bus chassis' etc.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The Habit bodywork was designed for low-floor buses, hence the deep windows and the provision of wheelchair bays (but used by TIBS as standing bays on the O405G).

            <div class='col-md body'>From your manner of writing, my impression is that you have not got the message i was driving across with regard to the subject of rules ! I shall not repeat myself much.<br><br>Very simplistically speaking, my approach to having rules is to set a sort of yardstick or reference standard for people to refer to such that they know if they are deviating from it or not &amp; if so, by how much. That to me answers why the need to have rules in the 1st place. Certainly NOT 'no point' as such !<br><br>My stand has always been HOWEVER that one, in real life, CANNOT always blindly comply with whatever set rules &amp; details etc. like some dumb nut down to perfection ! The ideal world of 100 % compliance would NEVER tend to exist anywhere whether in SGP or MY ! That IS &amp; will remain reality !!!!<br><br>SBST, TIBS, HI, SJE etc. so many others in SGP &amp; MY (too many operators especially in MY) ALL have had their fair share of NON-compliances @ some time or another, over some issues or another.

Please do wake up to take notice.<br><br>This issue of buying tickets upon boarding @ checkpoint etc., i've touched on it in another post recently &amp; have stated my case why that has to be allowed for, if people have any common sense @ all !<br><br>Overall therefore, really pointless to make noise on HI (or any other operator for that matter) over any such non-compliances !
