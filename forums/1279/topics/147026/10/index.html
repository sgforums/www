I think you didn't back-track to read our earlier postings properly, that's why you're confused and blur.<br><br>First of all, please note that CW3 is split into:<br>a) LOCAL ROUTE (Black signage on the bus):<br>Kotaraya -&gt; Tmn Perling -&gt; Bkt Indah -&gt; Gelang Patah<br><br>b) SINGAPORE ROUTE (Blue signage on the bus):<br>Gelang Patah -&gt; CIQ -&gt; Tuas Checkpoint -&gt; Jurong East<br><br>At the same time, HI svc 666 is going by:<br>Larkin -&gt; Tun Aminah -&gt; Gelang Patah<br>(*Once at Gelang Patah, passengers from svc 666 will transfer to CW3 SGP route).<br><br>The SHUTTLE BUS which I mentioned was initially HI's TRIAL SERVICE to pick up passengers from WITHIN BKT INDAH -&gt; Gelang Patah because at first CW3-Local route did not enter Bkt Indah's residential estate, merely passing through the roundabout &amp; immediately hit the highway towards GP.<br><br>Secondly, please understand that there is a B-I-G DIFFERENCE in the number of passengers travelling by Causeway with 2nd Link. Probably about 80-90% of people travelling in-and-out of JB-S'pore daily still opt for the Causeway, due to the fact that many are not staying anywhere near Tmn Perling, Bkt Indah, Gelang Patah or Tun Aminah.<br><br>Therefore, CW3 does NOT have the same service frequency as that of CW1 or CW2. Todate, CW1 has abt 30 buses, CW2 = 20 buses while CW3 only about 6-8 buses. CW1 operates at a frequency of every 5 minutes between Kranji-Larkin during peak hours while CW3 is every 30mins between Gelang Patah-Jurong East. See the difference?<br><br>So because of that, CW3's procedure is that of a "TYPICAL EXPRESS BUS" where it's "supposed" to WAIT &amp; HEAD-COUNT for everyone of its passenger before leaving Tuas checkpoint. It cannot afford to operate like CW1 because it does not have long queues of passengers like Woodlands Checkpoint. Morever, Tuas Checkpoint is not assessible by foot due to tight security. It does not have crowds of people coming in-and-out of it constantly.<br><br>But at times due to an unfortunate long queue at the immigration caused by another crowd of tourist, CW3 will not wait till all its passengers are aboard the bus because it has to abide by a strict schedule, which is monitored by the HI Time-keeper.<br><br>The incident of the 2 bus loads of ppl dumped together sometimes happen due to different scenarios. It could be:<br><br>a) The local route bus which was supposed to pick up passengers from Tmn Perling-Bkt Indah at a certain time (e.g. 6:10am) did not turn up, so we ended up boarding the next bus that came 20-30mins later and reaching Gelang Patah at 7:00am instead of 6.30am. So that explains passengers from 2 different time slot ended up on one same bus, which in turn causes the bus departing GP @ 7:10am to be much more FULLER THAN USUAL.<br><br>b) CW3 left some passengers at Tuas Checkpoint who were delayed at the immigration. So these passengers have to board the next oncoming bus. Again, the next bus also becomes fuller than usual.<br><br>c) CW3 experienced a tyre puncture after leaving Jurong East when it was nearing Tuas checkpoint (it was an unfortunate incident that really took place, believe me, I was there...), so once it reaches KSAB CIQ, it decided that it will not continue with the journey to Gelang Patah. So we had to wait to board the next bus coming from Jurong East. And of course, the next bus became a "2 bus loads of ppl dumped together" thingy....<br><br>Get it??</div>

From JE is still SGD3. I thought both sides also increased. Wrong conclusion. Anyway, I'm starting to feel the pinch paying 4.50MYR from Tmn Perling because I no longer get to experience the sort of "comfort" ride when CW3 first started. In the past, everyone of us passengers will get a seat and get to sleep throughout the journey. It was so relaxing... But now, we've started to push, race with each other upon exiting the immigration to the bus and fight or claw our way to get a seat.... and some still end up having to stand... sigh..<br><br>With such a hefty price yet still having to suffer a certain "mad rush", I'm starting to seriously think abt going by causeway again...</div>

Some of these incidents were what I experienced and some were testified by other passengers themselves:<br><br>1. On the first day of CW3's operation (29-Aug), our driver was not familiar with the route to Jurong East upon leaving Tuas Checkpoint. He kept asking another male passenger, "Is it this turn? Or the next turn? Where huh?.. Here?" Imagine what would have happened if no one had directed him. We'd hv gone on a Singapore round-trip.<br><br>2. Once during the early stage of CW3's operation, we were all waiting for the Singapore-bound bus in the morning but it was very late in coming. What we heard was that the driver was not familiar with the highway route so he lost his way trying to find the exit to Gelang Patah.<br><br>3. Not only was there a driver who did not know how to enter Gelang Patah, there was also one who did not know how to get back to the highway towards Tuas! My friend told me there was once her SG-bound CW3 made a wrong turn and was back heading towards Bkt Indah. Hah!<br><br>4. Then another time during the initial stage, a Johor-bound CW3 left its passengers at Johor CIQ and made a U-turn back to Singapore WITHOUT the knowledge of the passengers nor the HI Time-keeper himself!<br><br>5. Another hilarious one... my friend told me she heard from her friend that there was one morning, everybody waited for 10-20mins at Tuas checkpoint before they realised something was amiss. Passengers started to get curious and one by one they went into the immigration office to ask "Where the heck is our driver?!" Apparently the driver's permit has expired and he was being detained and barred from entering Singapore. Hah! And so they had to wait to board the next bus.<br><br>6. The incident reported by hannwei abt the driver who lost his autopass at Tuas checkpoint one morning...<br><br>7. Johor-bound CW3 had a tyre punctured while heading towards Tuas Checkpoint...<br><br>8. Last Friday evening, passengers going home to Bkt Indah-Tmn Perling who took the 1700 &amp; 1730 from JE were stranded together at Gelang Patah because there was no Kotaraya-bound bus. Instead, 3 buses of HI 666 were all parked there (white elephants!). Eventually one of the HI Chinese staff ordered his 666 driver to drive to Larkin via Bkt Indah-Tmn Perling with him onboard to direct the way. So all passengers goin to Bkt Indah-Tmn Perling acutally got home on 666! And it sure puzzled many people at that area to see svc 666 instead of 111.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Either the numbers were keyed in wrongly or it went haywire. So because of the error in the computerised system, it became the standard fare rate for the day. Hah!<br><br>CW3 is full of lunacy at times...</div>

First of all, 2nd Link is not a popular route during off-peak hour but HI is trying its best to maintain an image of consistency so that the public knows there'll always be CW3 buses traveling to and fro JB-S'pore via 2nd Link round the clock the whole day, everyday, whether peak or off-peak, many or few passengers, rain or shine. But in doing so, it is suffering a loss because ferrying less than 10 or even less than 5 passengers whether from GP or JE during off-peak definitely cannot cover the operational cost.<br><br>A passenger ever told me that she normally boards the CW3 in the mid-morning which is during off-peak as she has a totally different working hour from us. And there was once she waited 1&amp;1/2 hour at Gelang Patah for the S'pore-bound bus. She was so turned-off that she decided sheÂ’ll no longer board CW3 when going to work, except only when returning from SÂ’pore. So it does seem that it is very difficult for HI to meet the needs of the few passengers during off-peak without resulting in losses on its end. It also causes HI to lose more and more passengers as people began to discover that it is not very ideal to take CW3 to SG during off-peak.<br><br>So what is the implication if HI decide to only run CW3 during the peak hours or fix a certain service timing, say between 5.30amÂ–12nn &amp; 5pm -11pm and weekends round the clock? Will HI suffer greater loss if it pours in more concentrated efforts to meet only the needs of the working class during weekdays?</div>

In small towns, though the frequency might be a bus every hour, the bus always departs at, say, 1000, 1100, 1200 etc.  The passengers can plan their journeys quite accurately with little frustration, which in turn helps maintaining passenger loyalty, and the bus company can reduce the number of loss-making trips during off-peak periods.<br></div>

It's kinda ridiculous to begin from Kotaraya actually 'coz those who are already at JB town will enter S'pore by causeway. Isn't it??<br><br>CW3 can make Gelang Patah its main station or HQ and from there provide shuttle buses ferring passengers from nearby residential areas like Tun Aminah, Tmn Perling, Bkt Indah, etc. Wouldn't it be wiser to shorten its route and increase the frequencies?<br><br>Or maybe CW3 should aim at the northern region of Johor, e.g. Ulu Tiram, Masai, Skudai, etc. for the 2nd Link route.</div>

The residential areas add on to the revenue as it is a very costly route (because of the tolls at the 2nd link).
