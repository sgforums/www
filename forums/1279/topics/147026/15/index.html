Goods which costs noticibly cheaper in MY over SGP tend to be food, houses, land, cars i.e. usually the 'big-ticket' items instead, instead of the more lower valued 'basic' items.<br><br>Back to issues of buses &amp; transport, the costs of acquring these &amp; the fares charged of course cheaper in MY compared to SGP, adjusting for the same grade of vehicle &amp; class of service.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hannwei:</div><div class="quote_body">Since the hypermarkets are far from the town center, I suppose most visitors from Singapore drive.

It is sold at around 220 MYR in Johor Baru.  at Sim Lim, it is about 120 to 140 SGD.<br><br>As for DDR RAM, the price in Johor Baru is about 96 MYR for a single piece of 256 MB capacity (Kingston).

            <div class='col-md body'>Their so-called 'stringent' security checks i observe to be not much more than a big load of hot air for show purposes ! Good disguise for 'intentional inefficientcy' that's really about it !! So that some people here get their needed doses of 'superior security' here.<br><br>If one were to observe the design of the checkpoint complex &amp; the roads leading into &amp; out from it, much indeed can &amp; ought to be done to improve on them to increase traffic discharge efficientcy (they can perhaps get some hints from the giant size new Johor complex coming up just next door !) while maintainng whatever perceived existing levels of 'stringent security checks' !<br><br>They don't need to cramp all cars, buses, trucks into just a few narrow discharge lanes before 'releasing' them onto the highways here ! Are they trying to say that they only have 'so few' manpower available to perform security duty that only these few men/women can do the job that that's why they 'need' to squeeze everybody thru the stupid bottlenecks ?!??<br><br>They really have 'no money' to hire more security staff, open more counters, build more lanes etc. to do all the necessary to not only maintain security but ALSO to improve both human &amp; vehicular traffic discharge efficiencies ?!??<br><br>I most honestly cannot believe that ! Surely they cannot just rely on just those 'few' exisiting security staff to man the thousands of people &amp; vehicles passing in/out daily ! They can perhaps learn something from the wide spread out concept used in the Malaysian toll booths e.g. of spreading out the traffic such that everybody is still 'inspected upon' before being 'passed' to go i.e. nobody 'escapes' paying their tolls &amp; what not ? Surely it cannot mean that you must have just 2 or 3 narrow lanes then the security is 'good' else with many more lanes the security 'drops' ?!?? That's nonsense logic because it's not asking the existing few staff to mann many more lanes BUT to hire more new personnel to mann the increased lanes instead ! The nett result in security levels is practically the same except that more can be processed in the same time ! Surely the Singapore Government is rich &amp; competent enough to acquire more such personnel to do the jobs ! No funds is certainly no excuse here, if that's what they thinking of saying !!!! No land here to build more spread out lanes they can resort to building more multi-storey lanes instead. No excuses !<br>It's only money involved, something they are well rich enough to afford !!<br><br>Whatever those few security men/women are now doing surely they can produce more such personnel thru more hiring &amp; training etc. such that each &amp; everyone of them can produce the same standard of work output WITHOUT compromising in overall security 'stringentness' !<br><br>The end result then is that whatever exisiting security levels are maintained if not enhanced AND the same time improving on the human &amp; vehicular processing discharge rates hence processing efficientcies thru their complex.<br><br>I don't think they need to wait for the new giant size Johor complex to set the standard before learning from them ! Singapore is supposed to be more 'advanced' &amp; 'efficient' etc.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Apex-LW'21:</div><div class="quote_body">SG side has stringent security checks.</div></blockquote></div>

Therefore the unavoidable speculation then is that they try to make it as unattractive as possible for people here to convinently get there &amp; back !!!!!!</div></blockquote>YES, I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU!!! Singaporeans can be very efficient if they want to, but this appears to be a deliberate attempt to discourage Singaporeans from visiting Malaysia. Imagine that only 4 to 6 counters out of the total 32 counters are open to a long meandering queue. It takes 40 minutes to 1 and 1/2 hours to clear the stupid immigration at Tuas!!! Look at the way the immigration officers work when they're checking your passports. They insist on looking at you to compare your face with your photo in your passport. And this can take some time especially if you do not resemble your old passport photo. As for the security checks, they like to go through everything in your boot and car. Imagine how long that takes!!!<br><br><strong><blockquote>The Singapore side i prefer to believe likes to put up plenty of 'show' for people to see, even from miles away while the Malaysian side tends to be more 'discrete' so people think they're 'sloppy' compared to the Simgapore side. But in ultimate reality i have to conclude that afterall don't be too surprised that the 'nett effect' of the different approaches taken need NOT yield any significantly different outcomes ! </blockquote></strong><br><br>As you said, it's FOR SHOW ONLY. The consequence of the SHOW will help to meet the objective of discouraging Singaporeans from going over to Malaysia.</div>
