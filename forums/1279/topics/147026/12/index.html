            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i consider it tolerable as long as it does not result in any noticable delays on the trip overall for the passengers.<br><br>I've even seen a (fare paying) passenger benefitting from such detours when a CW2 driver modified his route to Larkin after leaving the Causeway to pass along Menera Tower to drop off an off-duty driver. This passenger who boarded @ Causeway took advantage of the situation by alighting @ Menara too ! Saved quite some walking compared to if alighting along Wong Ah Fook etc.<br><br>If managed properly therefore can be a win-win situation for the passengers too as they then get a more personalised &amp; tailored level of service (like on the CityLink minibuses here) eventhough they not supposed to be taking a 'premier' service &amp; paying the higher fares !<br><br>So they do 'think out of the box' there afterall !<br><br>In Singapore of course there's ever such happenings too among the public bus operators like SJE (no detours seen but they do pickup &amp; alight 'known people' like off-duty drivers as they like) or SBST, although here seems the passengers don't seem to know how to take advantage of such situations ! People here seems too 'rigid' &amp; inflexible in their thinking since that appears to be how they are 'conditioned' here, unfortunately. Only on SBST 170 here it seems that lately they have shown some 'flexibility' by making unannounced detours sometimes @ Woodlands area. They have to 'learn' otherwise they'll ultimately  lose out.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by purplecrazed:</div><div class="quote_body">Yah, only in m'sia we have bus drivers making detours for their own personal interest &amp; agenda.<br><br>There was once a CW3 drove past Bkt Indah all the way to Tmn Tan Sri Yacob.
