              <p>No, no, no!</p>
              <p>Yours truly was appalled at your comprehension of my post. But good try anyways. </p>
              <p>I was replying to TIB1234T's "OT" post, which was on how the GOVERNMENT keep adding new INFRASTRUCTURES to JE and BPJ. So it's not only on buses here. In fact, I have no intend to touch on on buses. </p>
              <p>Just for some examples, look at Tampines. Hot pie in the past! New int, new malls, more publicity, which is what made the place so crowded now. It was great, but then they suddenly gave up Tampines and moved on. How is that so? Well, JE master plan included new hospitals, new malls, and a "hub of the 21st century". Why JE? Tampines alr have some buildings to give a good start. And near to airport somemore. </p>
              <p>And god, look how they favourite JE so much nowadays. Closed down my favourite Prologue in Orchard just for a new "Borders" to open in JE. JE! I mean, why would us East residents want to go there then. So far. </p>
              <p>Given the above this hints that balanced developments do the best, and not just taking away the privilege of all just to develop a specific area. I can't move there due to my location of occupation, and neither can I drive coz the COE is so bloody high. </p>
              <p>So I am good with JEM, in fact I appreciate and loved it, but if it means all our privileges in the east are slowly gonna shift to the west then this may be just ridiculous. </p>
              <p>Punggol was, well, somewhere between the Tampines and JE/BPJ era. Watertown was a major hit, and so is the Punggol Waterway; but future plans just include more and more HDB rising from leisurely empty patches. </p>
              <p>As for my place of residence, Sengkang, it's quite sad to say the era is way over. Just some flats and schools. But a turnaround came when the hospital was announced so that is a good job by the government. </p>
              <p>All in all, it is just plain favouritism in some places. Tell you what, hardly will you ever see Punggol, Sengkang or Tampines in the news nowadays. But what about JE? I can foresee more and more developments and more of my favourite weekend landmarks to disappear...</p>

              <p>When you start developing an area, you want to build all the infrastructure so that people are tempte to move as far as Tampines in the east, Punggol in NE and Jurong in the West. Have you seen Jurong East infrastructure before government did something? Rubbish. You have such a high population density but so little malls/cinema/hospital.</p>
              <p>I am sure when Tengah and Simpang are developed, they will put in a lot of focus on developing these towns, and then you will hear more of development in these towns and not in JE/BPJ. Makes sense?</p>

              <p>Punggol is not fully developed yet. Once it is, expect more services. For now, there are good # of services with good frequency. I agree there should be a CBD service and strongly encourage merging 82 and 107 to ply Punggol - Shenton Way.</p>

              <p>It's great when there are developments. In fact, the government should be praised for this. </p>
              <p>But when the government overdo it and pay so much attention to it, and thus FORCING the people from other parts of Singapore to head to that place, then it is favouritism. By shifting the resources from the central to the west, and also making all developments and asking all businesses to stop investing in other parts of Singapore completely, the government is depriving the shared advantages of all and giving them to another place that is so hard to access. Would you want the residents in the east/north-east to take an hour by train just to go to his/her favourite place which have shifted to such a faraway place? I dont think so.</p>
              <p>And this means the development aren't balanced. From what I can comprehend in the news JE is now regarded as a hub, which means they expect workplaces there. I heard from some of my friends some major companies are planning to shift their HQ from the city to the west since it makes them "more exclusive". How are the residents in the east gonna go to work easily? </p>
              <p>So not to say JE do not deserve new infrastructures, but what the government is doing now is showing favouritism and adding good stuff to JE without a single thought of the rest of Singapore. </p>
              <p>And fine, Tampines do have enough. But all the new features (eg Hotels, flagship stores) are going to JE! Why not have a few in the other areas? Why all to JE? I know people will start saying "coz is MRT interchange what!" but the location is not strategic as to the CBD and some other areas! What about Bishan? MRT interchange and right in the middle of Singapore but why is it still using an old bus interchange? Why for the next 10 years all the good stuff belongs to JE? Is JE going to be the new CBD? Do we then have to take an hour to get to places we need to go?? Again I'm not trying to say that JE don't deserve it but don't you think all those developments is too much for that particular area? Can't we share it across the island?</p>
              <p>Favouritism or not, I leave it up to you.</p>

              <p>Might be likely... Which mean only 920 will be the last Bukit Panjang feeder to do Bukit Panjang Ring Road and Bangkit Road, but LTA could amend 972 to do Bangkit Road in both directions (which means new bus stops in the directon of Orchard), so those living near Bangkit Road can use 972 instead of 190 along Bukit Panjang Road and also use 972 to get to Bukit Panjang Int (now temporary). </p>

              <p>Nope. It would've been withdrawn instantly if 972 is non BSEP. But BSEP is to allow commuters to have more choices, more buses, reaching destinations quicker and improving the existing network, so yeah 922 would stay. </p>
