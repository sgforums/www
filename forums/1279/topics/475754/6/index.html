              <p>As mentioned by SMB128B, I would agree with him that SMRT is unlikely to operate any direct services that replicates their train lines. LTA might do so in the form of BSEP, but it seems like they would pour their resources elsewhere currently.</p>
              <p>So perhaps the next closest solution would be to feed YT residents to somewhere with direct access to town instead, which BPJ seems to be a nice solution.</p>

              <p>That is something I don't hope to happen with HK anytime soon. HK currently do have partial fare and tapping out on some services, but implementing distance fare would in my opinion cause the entire system to collapse into sg's less than functional state.</p>
              <p>What makes HK buses fast and efficient (although it may cost a little more for long distance services) is that they run on a stepped fare scheme, with little transfer rebates. <br>The huge implication that this brings is that on long distance trunk services, (e.g. any of the XHT services), there would be almost no pax boarding after halfway as comparable fares on "local" services is a dollar or two cheaper. This greatly reduces the travelling and runtime of long distance trunk services as pax would only alight, whereas in SG most of the trunks would act as feeder halfway through the route, causing a significant slowdown.</p>

              <p>How 700 becomes redundant? If you extend 972 to Shenton Way, their routes are similar from Whitley to Shenton Way. Moreover, most pax on 700 come from BPJ Ring Road, who will now take 972.</p>
              <p>The only exclusive part for 700 will be Petir Road.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, expected. Even evening peak load not bad. It provides direct connection to the numerous HDB hubs in BPJ Ring road, more than 190/700 does. The way to having more people take buses is by providing services as much as possible directly to their homes - not possible everywhere.</p>

              <p><br>This reminded me..last saturday at around 4.05pm the queue at 190 berth was crazily long too..queue till close to 67 berth..SMB342Z was spotted parkeing in the int with 190 EDS on..as i boarded 307 soon after, didnt managed to see how long the pax eventually waited and not sure if SMB342Z really did 190...</p>
              <p>So thats 3 days out of 4 days of weekend possible... hmm...</p>

              When I took 190 today frequency still looked okay.. load still the same.
              
              972 seems to be doing well in terms of loading though. SMB3090E and SMB3091C passed within 5 minutes of each other in the opposite direction at around 2.30pm at Bukit Panjang Road after Block 223 bus stop. No standees but seats were filled. Besides that's after the bus have unloaded passengers at the Block 223 bus stop

              <p><br>No resources are taken away from 190. I can assure you that. In fact, extra trips on weekends. It may be traffic that delayed the bus.</p>
