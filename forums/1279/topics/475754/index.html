              <p>190 may still have a high load, due to using Bukit Panjang Road, without any detours. 972 might not have a very high loading due to routing around Bukit Panjang Town, but I see the load coming from the LRT areas: Bangkit , Fajar, Segar and Jelapang, though it does duplicate 922 and 971E a lot. Anyway, thanks for loading up the poster here!Â <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png?1212956094" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>I think that the route will only take away 190's loading at Blk 270 along Bukit Panjang Road, before going to Whitley Road. I actually think they should make 972 use Bangkit Road (with new bus stops in direction of Orchard) after Bukit Panjang Ring Road, so people don't need to walk to take 190 to the city at Blk 270.</p>

              <p>I suggest re-routing 700, skipping orchard and straight to Downtown. In that case its load won't be eaten by 972/190 and DTL. To make up less stops and to allow CCK residents to head to Suntec and other places quickly I second extending it to CCK like what 23ispolo had suggested.Â </p>

              <p>And that's what I said. 972 will eat into 700's loading more than 190. But 700 express on Orchard road will also do no good because weekday loading between Shenton and Orchard is not heavy. Bus will run into loss. Maybe can parallel route to 960 to relieve some loading there.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said 29 new buses under the Governmentâs S$1.1 billion Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) have been added to services that ply Bukit Panjang, reducing congestion and waiting times during peak periods.</p>

The LTA said this stretch currently experiences âhigh traffic volumeâ, especially at key junctions and intersections during peak hours.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The authority laid out these measures as Bukit Panjangâs transport infrastructure came under the spotlight recently, after a video taken by a commuter, who said she was unable to board Service 190 13 times on Oct 4, became widely circulated online. Public transport operator SMRT announced last week that it would be launching a new bus service between Bukit Panjang and the city on Nov 17.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Mr Liang Eng Hwa, the constituencyâs Member of Parliament, said âthe challengeâ faced by Bukit Panjang is that it is âa matured town that is still growingâ. Bukit Panjang is currently home to more than 110,000 residents, with another 10,000 more expected to move to the estate over the next few years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Mr Liang said âthe main problemâ is that there is presently no MRT line serving the town. âHence, residents primarily rely on the public buses and LRT as the main modes of transport.

The 52-year-old said she has to take the feeder bus to Bukit Panjang Plaza in order to change buses to get to her workplace. âI prefer to walk because it only takes me about 10 minutes. Iâll spend more time waiting if I take the bus,â she said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Mr Liang said the location of the current interchange is also not ideal for the major trunk routes, with a bus hub â a longer bus stop that allows more buses to pick up commuters at the same time â along Bangkit Road serving as the default interchange for bus services for residents.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">âIt is so long that you do not know at which point of the extended bus stop the bus will come to a halt for commuters to embark. Hence, it is quite a common scene to see commuters racing along bus stop to (board) the bus which could be stopping at the other end of the bus stop,â he added.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The public transport situation could change in 2015 when a new integrated transport hub â comprising a new bus interchange integrated with an LRT station and an upcoming Downtown Line MRT station â is completed. The part of the Downtown Line running through the estate is scheduled to be completed in mid-2016.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Beyond public transport, residents also suggested more slip roads to nearby expressways.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">âMore slip roads can be built towards the Kranji Expressway to filter the traffic away from Bukit Panjang Ring Road. That area is quite packed, especially before and after school hours,â said Mr Keith Tan, 33.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">There are three schools within the Senja area, but most motorists prefer to use the same road, Bukit Panjang Ring Road, to access the area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The LTA said it is studying if Bukit Panjangâs accessibility to the nearby expressways could be enhanced. With the road widening and improvement work along Upper Bukit Timah Road and Woodlands Road scheduled to be completed by the end of 2015, motorists can expect shorter journey times by using the new flyovers to bypass two traffic junctions at Bukit Panjang Road and Dairy Farm Road, it added</p>

              bus stop the bus will come to a halt for commuters to embark.
              Hence, it is quite a common scene to see commuters racing along bus
              stop to (board) the bus which could be stopping at the other end of
              the bus stop,â he added.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The public transport situation could change in 2015 when a new
              integrated transport hub â comprising a new bus interchange
              integrated with an LRT station and an upcoming Downtown Line MRT
              station â is completed. The part of the Downtown Line running
              through the estate is scheduled to be completed in mid-2016.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">Beyond public transport, residents also suggested more slip roads
              to nearby expressways.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">âMore slip roads can be built towards the Kranji Expressway to
              filter the traffic away from Bukit Panjang Ring Road. That area is
              quite packed, especially before and after school hours,â said Mr
              Keith Tan, 33.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">There are three schools within the Senja area, but most motorists
              prefer to use the same road, Bukit Panjang Ring Road, to access the
              area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-family: 'Benton Modern RE', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">The LTA said it is studying if Bukit Panjangâs accessibility to the
              nearby expressways could be enhanced. With the road widening and
              improvement work along Upper Bukit Timah Road and Woodlands Road
              scheduled to be completed by the end of 2015, motorists can expect
              shorter journey times by using the new flyovers to bypass two
              traffic junctions at Bukit Panjang Road and Dairy Farm Road, it
              added</p>

              <p><br>but if you go to see - even BPJ was not covered well for so many years. Yes, they added buses to BPJ Interchange but bulk of people in BPJ live along BPJ Ring Road. They had no direct service for so many years except few time slots of 971E. It is only now that 972 is launched. My friend tells me AM/PM peak quiteÂ a hazard to take LRT. It is bursting. No good bus alternative as 920/922 frequency very poor.</p>
              <p>So only people who really lived along BPJ/Petir road got benefited. If someone from BPJ ring road takes LRT to BPJ Int, it is same like taking LRT from CCK to BPJ.</p>
