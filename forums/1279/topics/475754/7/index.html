              A child asked her dad when bus 972 is coming to the YMCA bus stop, and he replied that he's only 8% sure it is coming. 
              <p>
              She then said she's 100% sure its coming because the bus has a hair "like an elephant" and she just spotted it from far @ looping point

              <p>I think one point to clarify here is that BSEP services/enhancements as what SMB128B has mentioned are meant to improve bus connectivity and frequencies.</p>
              <p>They are not expected to be profitable (otherwise the bus co. would be operating it and not be labeled as BSEP nor using BSEP equipment). LTA pays SBST and SMRT whatever amount it <strong>costs</strong> to run the BSEP routes (and enhancements) and all of the fare revenue goes back into the 1.1bil funds, making it profit neutral for both SBST and SMRT.</p>
              <p>Since the goal is to improve connectivity, there is no need for any explainations why some of the loads of BSEP services such as 120 do not have sustainable (or breakeven) loads.</p>
              <p>The exceptions to this are the CityDirect services which are tendered out to pte bus co. which receives a fixed sum of money for running the routes. These are rather expensive to run since they are not running at cost, but at a profit to the pte co. I believe a fellow forumer previously did an analysis showing that each trip costs nearly $500 to run for CityDirect 651.</p>

              <p>Ok let's put it this way, when svc 50 was introduced, 163's load took a huge blow. But a question: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Was svc 163's fleet touched a single time at any time between the day svc 50 was born, and today?</span> Despite 163's load drop, why aren't some of the DDs being cut? Even its huge load demand at Fernvale are slowly drifting away, though there are other high loading sectors but not comparable to the load it used to exist on 163's Fernvale leg. Why no fleet cut?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you another truth of 700A that nobody here has mentioned. During weekends, one of the biggest crowds of people who would be commuting within the city centre would be those going to Suntec/Esplanade from Orchard Rd. There are two services, 36 and 700A that can bring the 50-70 pax load to their destination. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither of these services have gotten any BSEP add as of now</span>, and not counting 700's add as it does not do 700A. So on what grounds are you to say 700A's load will be affected? It's rigids are seen packed to the door and some even have to wait for bus 36 (which will again be packed), so why will its bendies go? </p>
              <p>972 is introduced as a mean to RELIEVE the congestion; not everyone will take 972, they take it at their own convenience. I can tell you, for example residents at BPJ City Centre, they won't want to ride 972 through numerous HDB estates before going onto BLE, correct? If it is meant to IMPROVE, why REVERSE it by taking away 700's bendies? Anyway the buses are paid by the govt what. </p>
              <p>As for 700, never underestimate the loading at the office areas. During PM peak, Tanjong Pagar alone receives more than 30 pax, and an additional 30 would board before it crosses over to Raffles City, where more pax would board. As it reaches Orchard, some would alight for dinner, but some who have happened to want to go back to BPJ would want to take the first bus they see, and in this case 700. By the time it departs Ngee Ann city the bus would have been full of standees. I know this becoz I take it sometimes from my friend's office at TP during PM peak with him to Ngee Ann City for dinner. </p>
              <p>So what does this show? It's not a must 700 would receive downgrades, I believe it won't for now, not sure when DTL comes in, but for now it should remain as it is. </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Ok let's put it this way, when svc 50 was introduced, 163's load
              took a huge blow. But a question: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Was svc 163's fleet touched a single
              time at any time between the day svc 50 was born, and
              today?</span> Despite 163's load drop, why aren't some of the
              DDs being cut? Even its huge load demand at Fernvale are slowly
              drifting away, though there are other high loading sectors but not
              comparable to the load it used to exist on 163's Fernvale leg. Why
              no fleet cut?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you another truth of 700A that nobody here has
              mentioned. During weekends, one of the biggest crowds of people who
              would be commuting within the city centre would be those going to
              Suntec/Esplanade from Orchard Rd. There are two services, 36 and
              700A that can bring the 50-70 pax load to their destination.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neither of these services
              have gotten any BSEP add as of now</span>, and not counting 700's
              add as it does not do 700A. So on what grounds are you to say
              700A's load will be affected? It's rigids are seen packed to the
              door and some even have to wait for bus 36 (which will again be
              packed), so why will its bendies go? </p>
              <p>972 is introduced as a mean to RELIEVE the congestion; not
              everyone will take 972, they take it at their own convenience. I
              can tell you, for example residents at BPJ City Centre, they won't
              want to ride 972 through numerous HDB estates before going onto
              BLE, correct? If it is meant to IMPROVE, why REVERSE it by taking
              away 700's bendies? Anyway the buses are paid by the govt
              what. </p>
              <p>As for 700, never underestimate the loading at the office areas.
              During PM peak, Tanjong Pagar alone receives more than 30 pax, and
              an additional 30 would board before it crosses over to Raffles
              City, where more pax would board. As it reaches Orchard, some would
              alight for dinner, but some who have happened to want to go back to
              BPJ would want to take the first bus they see, and in this case
              700. By the time it departs Ngee Ann city the bus would have been
              full of standees. I know this becoz I take it sometimes from my
              friend's office at TP during PM peak with him to Ngee Ann City for
              dinner. </p>
              <p>So what does this show? It's not a must 700 would receive
              downgrades, I believe it won't for now, not sure when DTL comes in,
              but for now it should remain as it is. </p>

              <p><br>That will not happen. Sv  190 load is here to stay. If loading drops on any service with introduction of 972, it is sv 700. Most people would take LRT/feeder to BPJ Int and change to 700 to city. With 972, they don't need to do that.</p>

              <p><br>My view is if 700 load goes down, and people prefer taking 190/972 compared to 700, SMRT should give the bendy to 190 and replace it with rigid. Anyway, this is if it happens and is in the future. I suspect the loading to fall.</p>
