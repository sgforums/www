              <p>I remember the wayangs long ago,They tried hard to impress the world that theyre open to competition but again its a long long same old story..After this Loyang SMRT might win again and Mandai goes to SBST..Wakakaka..If they guaranteed the two incumbents 80% of the route why bother to tender the 20% when the two giants can bid also?The 20% should let other companies bid la no matter what the cost right?</p>

              <p>Tne answer would be covered under one of the clauses of the Bulim contract, which itself is under NDA. Provided one of the incumbents win, we should know the answer once the winner begins executing the contract.</p>

              <p>Honestly, I do not understand. Why are we doubting them when they say they can deliver a certain service within a certain low amount of money?</p>
              <p>Is the amount below market rate? If so, why is the bid not rejected? </p>
              <p>In a similar context, when the government request for tender, there are instances where they reject bids that are too low. Not sure if it is land sales or another kind of product.</p>
              <p>That's why I say they should analyse the components of the costs. If there are components that are below market rate, then perhaps the LTA should reject the concerned bid.</p>

              <p>It is a difficult for LTA to draw lines in this matter. Our incumbants, SBST and SMRT have been running the show for the past 30+ years and no matter how much people might say they suck or whatsoever, lets not miss the point that they have been providing a decent public transport network in Singapore. Yes these days the buses and trains are so packed but it was not entirely their fault. Due to migration policies, our population has sharply risen over the past 10 years. Our incumbants have not had a easy jouney keeping up with these trends because they also need to buy new buses to add capacity, amidst the government's policy to move towards a full WAB fleet.</p>
              <p>LTA probably wants to introduce a few foreign players in the market to give more competition and push our incumbants to a first world standard and rather learn what we are lacking in SIngapore. Their plan definitely is not to bring in new players and drive the incumbants out. So I would feel that it is logical that most of the contracts still go to incumbants. If we ourselves dont support our local incumbants, who will? Also tell me a country which contracts out majority to a foreign company and leave the leftovers for the local companies. Lets also not forget the fact that our incumbants know our local situation better. Lastly, foreign operators always have risks involved - If they screw up they can just drop and run...</p>
              <p>So before saying LTA is putting up a show to the public etc., please understand the objectives of the contracting model. 1st contract highly likely will be incumbant because IMO LTA will play safe first and not do something risky that will make people criticise the whole GCM. Plus now incumbants have the lowest bids.  </p>

              <p>seriously, no one know what kinds of service standard that SMRT have promised in its proposal.... so if 7 other operators are bidding at 125 mil and above and one particular operator bid 20 mil below, there should be some areas of big difference in the service standard... maybe SMRT is proposing only 10 maintaince staff, while other  are using 20 or so.. nobody know... </p>
              <p>weird that SMRT can bid so much lower, while in the past few years, its bus operation suffered higher losses than SBST with much lesser fleets and all the while operating lesser higher capacity buses.....</p>

              <p>If SMRT made the shortlist, then its bid should fulfil the basic tender requirements, at least on paper. The question is whether it can actually do the job in practice at a reasonable standard, while remaining financially viable. There are several reasons why their bid could be so low:</p>
              <p>- SMRT is currently using part of Bulim depot and already has eqiupment and personnel set up there.</p>
              <p>- SMRT plans to squeeze out as much revenue as possible from advertising on buses and shop rental at interchanges, and believes the extra revenue is enough to cover costs.</p>
              <p>- SMRT has a much lower cost estimate for certain component(s), eg manpower, maintenance etc. We don't know the contents of the bids, but they must have convinced LTA that their cost estimates are reasonable for fulfilling the requirements if this is so.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>My opinion is SMRT does stand a reasonably good chance at winning the Bulim contract.</p>
              <p>The bid amount SMRT has given is a Godsend to LTA. The whole point of moving to GCM is to lower the costs of operations. A 25% reduction in costs is not unrealistic but it is better than the <a href="https://audit.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1997-Insert-BusReform.pdf">20% cost reduction Transperth achieved</a> back in 1993 during the initial period, when the Western Australian government moved to GCM. This level of reduction in costs may eliminate the need for the government to provide subsidy in operating Singapore's public buses.</p>
              <p>SMRT also made high-profile changes in the last few years to demonstrate that they are a quality operator. They have launched double-decker buses, a new livery and branding, dedicated training processes (driving simulator), NEC Telemetrics, onboard next bus indicator, roadshows and carnivals. SMRT should have emphasized these initiatives in their bid. Factors that may hurt SMRT include the Chinese drivers strike, recent MRT/LRT breakdowns, and QoS results.</p>
              <p>Both incumbents are giving the foreign operators a run for their money, which I deem to be a good thing. A foreign operator does not necessarily mean a better operator than the local incumbents. Our operating environment may be indeed unique in itself and the foreigners have yet to fully understand.  A transition between local operators is a lot less painful process as well, and helps to set the first steps right in moving to the GCM.</p>

              <p>It can be argued this way as well, though I am more inclined to call it an area contract because of the natural monopoly it grants over a given area, especially for its feeder routes. The operator still makes itself known to the community within the area, i.e. you have to call the operator's customer hotline directly (not LTA) to make a feedback.</p>
              <p>The concept of an area contract is made more obvious in Perth, where most areas of the city are served exclusively by one operator. In this case the Public Transport Authority does all route planning as well, but every new route would go to whoever was given the territory for that area. Therefore if you don't like the operator in your area, the only remaining option is for you to drive.</p>
              <p>By comparison, London operates on route contracts as each route is individually tendered out and operators have the option to bundle them up if they wished to.</p>
