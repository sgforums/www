              Currently, there are around twenty-six towns in Singapore. By 2030, there would be around four new towns (Tengah, Bidadari, Bukit Brown, Tampines North), making it thirty towns. 
              
              In the GCM, there are twelve packages. I believe these packages take into consideration of the new towns by year 2030, or even by year 2050 (including Seletar, Paya Lebar, etcetera). I assume the provision is for thirty-six towns, since thirty-six is a multiple of twelve and it is greater than thirty.
              
              Each GCM package would serve around three towns. From the first two packages in Bulim and Loyang, it can be seen that the number of bus services is around thirty-five. 
              
              In the case of Bulim package, it would begin with 367 buses on 26 bus services. With a capacity for 500 buses, this means there can be up to thirty-five bus services (26 / 367 x 500).
              
              Assuming the future new towns are factored in, this means some GCM packages will have the full number of around thirty-four bus services, while some GCM packages will have around twenty bus services, and some GCM packages may have around ten bus services only.

                                  <p>but, it's really coincidental...</p>
                                      <p>anyway, what I really want to write is that the implementation of GCM is a very long process, like the implementation of WAB.</p>
                                      <p>WAB started implementation in 2006. It's probably going to take another five years before all bus services are WAB. Total around fifteen years.</p>
                                      <p>GCM begins this year. The transition to GCM would probably be completed only around year 2027. Total around eleven years.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>after Bulim and Loyang, the third GCM would be the one in Sungei Seletar, followed by the fourth GCM in Ulu Pandan.</p>
                                      <p>Sungei Seletar Bus Depot will be ready in 2017 and Ulu Pandan Bus Depot will be ready in 2018. I guess Sungei-Seletar GCM will begin in 2018 and Ulu-Pandan GCM will begin in 2019.</p>
                      <p>I guess it's going to be one new GCM implemented a year, from year 2018 to year 2027.</p>
                  <p>Soon Lee Bus Depot tenure is until 1 April 2030. By 2027, it would only be three years before SLBP tenure ends, so it's quite likely that the tenure will end earlier in favour of a new bus depot by then.</p>

                      <p>what? that's all? if like that then might as well don't interview, just hire straight away.</p>
                  <p>actually, I was expecting some office-style interview, with around two rounds of interview. first round is about technical knowledge, second round is then about when you can start work, etcetera.... I was not expecting them to be so relaxed with the interview. well, this means they are really desperate for drivers, that they do not really care much.</p>
                      <p>by the way, just wondering, in the application form, did they ask you what's your poly/uni GPA, A lvl uni score, O lvl L1R5/L1R4, PSLE score, etcetera? or did they only ask you what's the highest driving license that you have?</p>

                                      <p>Actually, if like that, it is very clear which bus services would be in the third package..</p>
                                      <p>Yio Chu Kang Terminal has 6 basic bus services. Ang Mo Kio Interchange has 16 basic bus services. Total 22 basic bus services already.</p>
                                      <p>If include Yishun Interchange's 7 feeder bus services, that's 29 basic bus services. If include 6 of Sembawang Interchange's 8 bus services, that's 35 basic bus services already - full capacity. :)</p>
                                  <p> </p>
                                  <p>Woodlands Interchange's 29 basic bus services and Sembawang Interchange's remaining 2 bus services makes 31 basic bus services already. If the future GCM's depot location is good, we can include Choa Chu Kang Interchange's 4 feeder bus services to make a total of 35 basic bus services - full capacity. :)</p>
                              <p> </p>
                              <p>As for Yishun Bus Interchange's remaining 14 basic bus services, it can combine with Seng Kang Bus Interchange's 10 basic bus services and Pasir Ris Bus Interchange's remaining 5 basic bus services to make 29 basic bus services. We can have reserved capacity for 6 future basic bus services in Seletar, etcetera.</p>
                  <p>actually, the North area is quite easy to guess how the routes would be packaged.</p>

              <p>what? that's all? if like that then might as well don't
              interview, just hire straight away.</p>
              <p>actually, I was expecting some office-style interview, with
              around two rounds of interview. first round is about technical
              knowledge, second round is then about when you can start work,
              etcetera.... I was not expecting them to be so relaxed with the
              interview. well, this means they are really desperate for drivers,
              that they do not really care much.</p>
              <p>by the way, just wondering, in the application form, did they
              ask you what's your poly/uni GPA, A lvl uni score, O lvl L1R5/L1R4,
              PSLE score, etcetera? or did they only ask you what's the highest
              driving license that you have?</p>
