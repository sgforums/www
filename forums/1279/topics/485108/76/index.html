              <p>Maybe 12 new packages plus 1 new one that supplement some package..hahaha</p>
              <p>If LTA really want competition then the ratio should be:Tower Transit 3,Go Ahead 3,SBST 3 and SMRT 3 which i would think impossible.I think after 2022,SBST will get 6 packages,SMRT 3 and left with only 1 foreign operator which combine operation get 3 also.</p>

              <p>I feel that the government wants the incumbents to focus on the transition first, while attracting new operators to come in. This may explain why the incumbents will get negotiated contracts.</p>
              
              <p>The incumbents may be deliberately omitted from the first few tenders as the government wants new operators.</p>

              <p>I guess the strategy is to give the first few contacts to new
              operators first, to test the new operators - since they no prior
              experience.</p>
              <p>The first two contracts will expire around 2021-2023 and the
              next two will expire around 2023-2025. The negotiated contracts
              will expire at around 2021 - some may expire later, in 2023, 2025,
              etc.</p>
              <p>The real competition is after the new operators have their track
              records, like SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>
              <p>By then, the operators that meet expectations will be in the
              "director's list", while those that fail to meet expectations will
              be "blacklisted".</p>
              <p>This is how I think the competition is like: First give the new
              operators chance to present themselves, then cherry pick the best
              operators to do the job.</p>
              <p>So, yeah, the fourth package is likely going to be won by a
              foreign company.</p>
              <p>Hopefully not Tower Transit or Go Ahead, but another new foreign
              company, so that we can analyse more candidates later.</p>

              <p>But more operators means more competition, which is key for cost competitiveness, maximum utulization of taxpayer dollars and more efficiency, which is the point of GCM.</p>
              <p>if we don't have enough players, the incumbents will slack, other companies will be turned off from bidding and costs will rise because less competitive bids will be put as these companies are less pressured to be competitive. of course, the more is not always merrier</p>

              <p>Bus bidding is not a playground or an international tournament.</p>
              <p>What Malaysian, Indonesian or Taiwanese companies do you propose bid to run our services, in a way that would (seemingly) improve our service levels? They (including failed Chinese and Korean companies) don't have much experience in running public buses on a big scale in super high density areas like London.</p>
              <p>If Hong Kong companies like KMB or NWST were interested, they would have bid already. So I think its pure fantasy they would come in despite having the experience, unless of course they change their mind.</p>

              <p>None of the operators from these countries are interested for a simple reason.</p>
              <p>In all cases, they manage the fare revenue directly.</p>

              <p>And they are not experts at filling out the tender paperwork, either.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons why TT has won is because they have been doing that for over 20 years under Transperth's GCM.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third bus package put up for tender</span></strong></p>
              <div>
              <div>SINGAPORE: A third bus package under the Government Contracting Model was put up for tender on Tuesday (Jun 7), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced in a news release.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The Seletar bus package comprises 24 existing services and two new services, which will be announced later. The bus services will be operated from the Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang and Yishun Bus Interchanges, and will be supported by the new Seletar Bus Depot located off Yio Chu Kang Road, which is scheduled to be completed by the third quarter of 2017.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The existing bus services in this package are: 24, 70, 76, 130, 133, 135, 138, 162, 261, 262, 265, 268, 269, 800, 803, 804, 805, 806, 811, 812, 850E, 851, 852 and 860.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The package consists of about 420 buses, growing to about 500 buses in 2023 in tandem with new developments and projected growth in ridership, LTA said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The successful tenderer will also operate, manage, and maintain the Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchanges and the Seletar Bus Depot.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Both local and foreign bus operators can bid for the right to operate the package. All tender submissions will be evaluated through a two-envelope process for quality and price, with more weightage given to the quality proposals submitted by the tenderers, LTA said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The operator which successfully bids for the package will operate the bus services for five years, with the possibility of a two-year extension for good performance.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“The implementation of the bus services in the Seletar bus package will be carried out in two tranches from the first half of 2018, to allow sufficient time for the operator to build up its resources, such as recruitment and training of bus captains and technicians,” LTA said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The first bus package – the Bulim package – was awarded to London-based Tower Transit after 11 bids were received. The second bus package – the Loyang package – was awarded to another UK transport operator, the Go-Ahead Group, after 10 bids were received.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>UNION IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AFFECTED STAFF</strong></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>To safeguard the welfare of bus employees, the Public Transport Tripartite Committee will engage various stakeholders during the transition, LTA said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In a Facebook post on Tuesday, National Transport Workers’ Union (NTWU) executive secretary Melvin Yong said the union has been working closely with the committee to ensure that the concerns and feedback from the affected bus captains are taken into account.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The union, together with LTA, SBS Transit and SMRT, has conducted more than 10 engagement sessions with affected staff, he added.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“Through these sessions, we addressed their concerns, clarified their queries and sought their feedback regarding the latest changes,” he said.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>“While we will continue to engage the relevant stakeholders to ensure that workers are able to have a smooth transition to the new model, we also urge all bus operators to continue to work with the NTWU. This is so that we can all enjoy a harmonious, constructive and win-win industrial relations climate that will benefit both companies and workers.”</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>UK-based bus operator Tower Transit indicated interest in the latest bus package. Mr Andrew Bujtor, MD, Tower Transit Singapore told Channel NewsAsia: “We most certainly have our sights set on the Seletar package. There are significant economies and efficiencies that we can unlock by operating on a larger scale. We’re certain this will allow us to offer LTA a very competitively priced bid backed firmly by our local experience of running what will soon be a fleet of about 370 buses and 26 services.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>We’ve brought innovation to everything we’ve done in Singapore, set new industry standards in many areas, and now we’re focused on delivering the best possible service in order to present the best possible case for Tower Transit to be awarded the Seletar package.”</div>

              <p>Note that I have mentioned "LTA" rather than TTS...because TTS is simply a puppet of LTA uh..so is SMRT/SBST/Go-Ahead...</p>
              <p>Recently, there's plenty of complains over the 10km/hr speed on bus 77..even the bc is pissed when the BOCC ask them to slow down even more...check out the TTS fb page. I think if TTS is given full control of the frequency, maybe they will perform better. </p>

              <p>Note that I have mentioned "LTA" rather than TTS...because TTS
              is simply a puppet of LTA uh..so is SMRT/SBST/Go-Ahead...</p>
              <p>Recently, there's plenty of complains over the 10km/hr speed on
              bus 77..even the bc is pissed when the BOCC ask them to slow down
              even more...check out the TTS fb page. I think if TTS is given full
              control of the frequency, maybe they will perform better. </p>
