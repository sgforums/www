            <div class='col-md body'><p>The w.ay LTA carves out its packages, Dead mileage seems inevitable at the moment because there is only 1 bus depot per package and the services under the package is full control under that operator. Dead Mileage puts greater servicing requirement on buses and eventually increases operations costs. The only way dead mileage can be reduced is LTA taking into consideration the previously allocated packages and giving out the newer packages to operators in a way that they can do partial control between 2 depots that are operating</p></div>

              <p>Regarding the long-distance routes which would only operate from one depot at one end, I feel that to prevent or reduce mileage wastage, one possible solution is to have the last few buses of the day run fresh from the depot at one end, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>park over night at the interchange at the other end</strong></span>, and run to and fro both ends, until when the bus does not have enough fuel to run both directions (complete one cycle) already, then stop at the end where the depot is, and return to depot to re-fuel and maintain.</p>
              <p>I believe buses are allowed to stay over night at bus interchanges. If yes, then there should not be the problem of mileage wastage. </p>
              <p>Unless, the bus breaks down along the route. If it breaks down nearer to one end, where the depot is at the other end, there may be a service disruption. To solve that, one possible solution is to always <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">have one bus on stand by at the bus interchange at other end without bus depot for the bus service</span></strong>. </p>
              <p>But to bring the faulty bus all the way back to the bus depot is going to inevitably consume quite a significant amount of resources. Unless, there are external workshops at the other side that the bus operator can have contract with to send their buses for repairs, if there is any.</p>
              <p>Well, there should be solutions to every issue. I believe whichever proposals that can address these long-distance issues well would have an edge over other proposals.</p>

The interchange on the other end is not under the management of the current winner of the 1st package. Plus I dont believe bedok interchange has overnight parking currently. If do overnite parking there, there is also a need for security right? Cant just leave the buses there unguarded mah. And in future bedok interchange might be operated by a different winner.

              <p>Hmm I think most services will be full control under a
                  particular depot leh. For example look at Bulim Package tender. It
                  says operator manage Bulim Depot, Clementi, JE and BBT interchange.
                  Doesnt this mean all the bus services under Bulim Package will be
                  parked in Bulim irregardless of where the other end of the route
                  is? Because if the nearest depot to the terminating interchange is
                  managed by another operator, there wont be a partial control
                  right. </p>
              <p>For eg. Sv 66 Bedok to JE. JE side park at Bulim but Bedok side
                  if the depot is managed by another operator how can that operator
                  do a partial control? </p>

              <p>If 66 is majority SLBP, then it falls under JUE contract. If BN majority, then it is better for it to be under BDK.</p>
              <p>Look at 147 &amp; 165. They both start from HGN and end @ CLE, but since the former is majority BBDEP, I consider it part of CLE route group, while 165 being majority HGDEP should fall under HGN route group.</p>
              <p>Long distance routes like 14, 51, 61 &amp; 67 should get more than one operator if all sectors get carved up. In fact, right now 61 needs joint control. It should have happened back in 2007.</p>

              <p>If LTA were to follow closely to Perth's model, there are two approaches to this issue:</p>
              <p>1. 66 will operate under single depot control first. The winner for Bulim may then use it as an advantage in future tender (e.g. Loyang). They can propose a lower bid because they are able to factor in cost savings for operating out of two depots. This will continue until either the package containing the route is lost, or the other package involving the second depot is lost (e.g. Swan/Tower Transit losing <span class="st">Kalamunda).</span></p>
              <p>2. LTA decides to allow dual operators to run 66. In Perth, 99 (Circle Route, 3.5 hr either direction) is operated by all 3 operators. Superbus 950 has been given to two incumbent operators, of which passengers have a choice which they can board (although a normal passenger will not recognize which operators as livery across operators is uniform).</p>

              actually, for route 66, I have a feeling that it will be shortened to serve only between Jurong East and Jalan Jurong Kechil when the entire Downtown Line opens, because the entire Downtown Line (excluding stage 1) seems to duplicate route 66.

              <p>But based on its location at Lentor Avenue/Seletar Expressway, it is quite likely that it will operate bus services at Yio Chu Kang Bus Terminal and Yishun Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>These two combined already have around twenty five bus services. If not, can include Seng Kang Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Well, just guessing.</p>
