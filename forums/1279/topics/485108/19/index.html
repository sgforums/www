              <p>Personally, in my opinion, I feel that LTA should consider setting a limit in how many bus packages a bus company can operate at any one time.</p>
              <p>Because there may be a possibility that one bus company will always be better than the other bus companies, or it is always the same two bus companies winning bus contracts. If so, wouldn't we see a monopoly forming, or continue to have a duopoly in our public bus industry?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am only against monopoly. I am alright if there are only two bus companies operating bus services under the Government Contracting Model, because even so, there will still be (greater) competition, unlike today.</p>
              <p>My prediction for the first package: either SBS Transit or SMRT, or any other local bus company, will win. Local bus company may stand an advantage over foreign bus companies, since they already have experience in operating bus services here. </p>

              <p>agree the LTA livery on the LTA cars and pickups are freaking
                  ugly and also they look like police cars. if use this kind of LTA
                  livery and LTA logo are used on public buses then its a big
                  disgrace. better get a creative professional rebrand
                  completely.</p>

              <p>It seems that the concern is only on the livery.</p>
              <p>I have a suggestion:</p>
              <p>LTA can organise a drawing competition on livery design, and adopt ideas/concepts from the best entries into the common LTA livery.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, LTA can consult SOTA, NAFA, the Design schools in our Polytechnics, etc. on how to design the common LTA livery.</p>
              <p>Either suggestion would at least ensure that the common LTA livery looks nice. If very well designed, it may become our national identity, similar to the iconic red livery at London.</p>

              <p>This is where it gets worrying. The training period by the two incumbents were comprehensive to make sure they cover most ground.</p>
              <p>Would training time be sacrificed to put more drivers on the road more quickly, especially for new operators who have to create local training programs from scratch? Inadequate training can result in serious operational problems:</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>some foreign transport consultants criticised saying the bus routes should be kept up to max 18km only to ensure service reliability. I disagree. If a short bus route ends up in traffic bottleneck; it will still cockup the bus schedule no matter what. Will a short bus route bring greater customer satisfaction? i dont think so. what we need is a series of semi-express buses from mid to relative long haul. Semi-express buses to avoid traffic bottlenecks whenever possible or kept to a minimal to ensure better reliability. how about building flyover bus lanes above busy roads and expressways? </p></div>
