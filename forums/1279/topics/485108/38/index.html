              <p>One very one-size-fits-all solution that can be used to address

              <p>Introduce a Certificate course at the ITE, and/or introduce a
              Diploma course at the Polytechnic, to train people to drive
              buses.</p>
              <p>Right now, isn't there already a new Diploma on transport
              management? Maybe in future, we can have new diploma or certificate
              courses on driving buses.</p>
              <p>Maybe entry level as technicians, to familiarise with the
              components. Then rise to be bus drivers, to drive the bus. then
              rise from single to double decker. Thereafter, with technician and
              bus driver experience, rise to traffic controller. Thereafter, to
              supervisor. Etcetera...</p>
              <p>Rise until top already, then promote to work for LTA. within
              LTA, rise, rise, rise,... rise... rise until top of LTA already,
              then promote to work for the transport ministry.</p>

              <p>really ah, I think hor, if want to attract Singaporeans to be bus drivers, one of the best way is to introduce a bus driver course at the ITE and the Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>at least bus driver is not like fast food. not any tom, harry or dick can be bus driver. no such thing as part-time driver, right? see? bus driver all full time de. some more there is a certain barrier to entry to be bus driver. must have a certain driving license then can be bus driver.</p>
              <p>so, why not have a bus driver course? (instead of some low demand high supply course... shall not say here... but you probably know a few... high cop, no choice then study de... those few...) cop can be set very high..... dont need maths and science also can do.... so long as english or mt good can already....</p>

                      (S$26) per hour</span></strong> and they can choose
                      to work extra hours if they want to
                      earn more money. They typically work
                      about eight hours per shift.</p>
              <p>Mr Balkin noted that Sydney has
                  high cost of living and tax rates. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There
                  is also a strong union presence. Labour

              <p>Drivers’ benefits:
              BBQs and presents
              Transit Systems employs 324 drivers.
              Of these, nine are full-time female
              drivers. About 11 per cent — or 35 — of
              the drivers work part-time.
              “At present ... most employees are
              looking for full time employment,
              but we attempt to provide flexibility
              within the needs of the business,” said
              MrBalkin. All their part-time drivers
              go through the “same comprehensive
              training programme” as their fulltime
              counterparts.
              Mr Sergio Fiorenza, 51, who owns
              a business, drives the bus part-time.
              Describing working conditions as
              “pretty good”, he said: “If you tell them
              you need to do this on a certain day,
              then they’ll change your shift, especially
              if you’re someone who always
              helps them. It’s a give-and-take, I’ve
              never had a problem.”
              He added: “No matter how trivial
              you think the matter is, if they think
              you deserve the day off they’ll give it
              to you.”</p>

              </span></p><h1>Bus contracting model will benefit commuters and transport workers</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The new bus contracting model, in which routes are tendered out for operators to bid for, will benefit both commuters and transport workers, Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said on Saturday.<br><br>"Competition for skills... people to do the jobs will intensify," she said. " From that perspective, we see the bus contracting as providing that opportunity for operators - present and future - to think about how they could step it up to a different level."<br><br>With the potential for more players to enter the market, bus companies must not only ensure operations are well run, but also step up their recruitment, staff training and career development, she added.<br><br>The inaugural tender under the Government contracting model was awarded to London-based Tower Transit on May 8. The firm beat seven other bidders including incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>

              <p>JUST MY THOUGHTS..</p>
              <p>Will S'poreans consider joining TT? Or any operators? Given that the package will be up for bid every 5years, how to encourage more ppl to join? </p>
              <p>Isn't it telling them that you may or may not lose your job in 5 years time. Govt. say they will help to "transfer" them over to new enviroment, but how successful will that be? Different company have different guidelines + salary + standard leh..</p>

              <p>based on SBST/SMRT bus fares revenue for 2014, they collected around 1 billion in fare revenue from bus operations..</p>
              <p>so based on the current tender price of 115 mil x 12 tenders = 1.38 billion, LTA is going to lose 380 million per year by having this GCM... and this does not even include the cost of building bus depots/buying buses... so how much they are going to increase the fares? </p>
