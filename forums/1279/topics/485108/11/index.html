              <p>Yes, the bus fares will increase, but I think only in
              short term (within the first five years), because LTA has to pay
              SBS Transit &amp; SMRT for buses, depots, interchanges &amp;
              terminals, and apply a common LTA livery &amp; design on them
              thereafter. LTA will incur a higher amount of costs, thus
              it is inevitable that bus fares has to increase during this
              transition period, otherwise it is our tax that will

              <p>so after 5 years no need to pay for new buses? and dun forget that LTA wan to improve the frequency further, that mean more buses and more drivers and thus more empty return trips.</p>

              <p>960 is managed pretty well. There are many other services under SMRT belt that need severe improvement, of course one of them is 190... there is also 169/854/857.</p>

              <p>Also I am okay with 960A only if it is fleet add and not at the
              expense of taking buses away from 960 as there is huge demand

              <p>Since 960A is very much to cater for the workers, its best to be operating on:</p>

              <p>sorry. what i meant was that in this 5 years (2016-2021), LTA will incur an expense that is larger than usual because besides buying new buses and other assets and incurring other new expenses, it has to buy over the existing assets from SBS Transit and SMRT. </p>
              <p>beyond 2021, LTA will be the one buying &amp; replacing the assets. it has to pay for new assets, except the expenses will not be as large as during the initial 5 years.</p>

              <p>Not everytime it's smooth sailing, but it is possible to have

              make a U-turn where svc.23 loops at, possible to start return trip

              <p>On your point, svc.960 is still alright for maybe 70-75% of its frequencies since it has 2 BSEPs... The rest of % is just playing with your time... If it happens to BSRF next time round, it'll probably be like 50-50 pass and fail...  </p>
