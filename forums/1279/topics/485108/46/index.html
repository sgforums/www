              <p>Some analysis:</p>
                          <p>First package announced in April 2014, open in October 2014, closed in January 2015 (3 months later), awarded in May 2015 (4 months later) and will begin in June 2016 (13 months later) at <strong>Bulim</strong>. Total 26 months.</p>
                          <p>Second package announced in March 2015, open in April 2015, closed in August 2015 (4 months later). Based on the first package, the second package should be awarded in December 2015 (4 months later) and begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 2017</span></strong> (13 months later) at <strong>Loyang</strong>. Total 22 months.</p>
                          <p>I guess the LTA wants to award the second package first, before they announce the third package.</p> <p>So, I guess the third package will be announced in January 2016. If based on the second package timeline (refined from the first package timeline), third package should open in February 2016, close in June 2016 (4 months later), awarded in October 2016 (4 months later) and begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 2017</span></strong> (13 months later). Total 22 months.</p>
                          <p><strong>Sungei Seletar </strong>depot will be ready in 2017 Q3, and Ulu Pandan depot will be ready in 2018 Q1. I guess the third package will use Sungei Seletar depot.</p>
                          <p>Since Ulu Pandan depot will be ready in 2018 Q1, I guess they may want to start the fourth package now and use Ulu Pandan depot, rather than wait until 2021/2022.</p>
                                          <p>Hence, the fourth package may be announced in November 2016, open in December 2016, close in April 2017 (4 months later), awarded in August 2017 (4 months later) and begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">September 2018</span></strong> at <strong>Ulu Pandan</strong>.</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>Thereafter, the subsequent packages may begin only from around September 2021.</p>
                          <p>If the fifth package begins in September 2021, it should be announced in November 2019, open in December 2019, close in April 2020 (4 months later), awarded in August 2020 (4 months later) and begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">September 2021</span></strong> (13 months later).</p>
                          <p>If the sixth package is announced in September 2020, awarded in June 2021, it should begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2022</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Likewise,</p>
                          <p>Seventh package announce in July 2021, awarded in April 2022, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 2023</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Eighth package announce in May 2022, awarded in February 2023, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 2024</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Ninth package announce in March 2023, awarded in December 2023, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 2025</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Tenth package announce in January 2024, awarded in October 2024, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 2025</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Eleventh package announce in November 2024, awarded in August 2025, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">September 2026</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Twelfth package announce in September 2025, awarded in June 2026, begin in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2027</span></strong>.</p>
                          <p>Changi depot will be ready in 2024 and Kim Chuan depot in 2025. I guess <strong>Changi</strong> depot will host the ninth package while <strong>Kim Chuan</strong> depot will host the tenth package.</p>
                          <p>There’s six depots not yet announced.</p>
                          <p>Taking reference to Ulu Pandan depot, which was announced in April 2015 and will be ready in 2018 Q1, it takes three years from announcement to ready.</p>
                          <p>The six not-yet-announced depots will be needed in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2026 and 2027. Hence, I expect a new depot to be announced in year 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024.</p>

              <p>Assuming these are only guesses ... I am not confident in the reliability of the dates from the fifth package onwards. Lots of other major transport events (e.g. train problems) and national events (e.g. GE) may deter the scheduling, or bring them forward. There could also be major transport technology revolutions in ten years' time, who knows? </p>

              under SBST, or they are about to be re-registered from those SBS

              <p>Those already with SG plate should be brand new. Saw a photo of SG5003Y (B9TL) and it had headrests on the priority seats, like the Batch 4 B9TL buses.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Bus drivers hired by Tower Transit, which will run 26 services from 2016, will get a monthly basic starting pay of S$1,865, the London-based transport operator said on Thursday (Nov 12).</p>
              <p>Women drivers will get 26 weeks of maternity leave, more than the current 16 weeks of Government-paid leave. All staff can also upgrade their skills, including applying for sponsorship to enrol in degree courses.</p>
              <p>Their jobs will be redesigned as well, taking away the need for drivers to refuel, clean and park buses at the end of the day. A separate team from Tower Transit will take over these duties, and bus drivers can save up to 1.5 hours per day, the firm said.</p>
              <p>The new employment terms were developed by Tower Transit together with the National Transport Workers Union.</p>
              <p>So far, Tower Transit has interviewed nearly 400 prospective staff. </p>
              <p>The London-based operator was awarded the first deal under the new Government contracting model for the bus industry. Tower Transit will operate buses which serve the Bukit Batok, Clementi and Jurong East interchanges. The transition of the bus services to Tower Transit will take place over three tranches from mid-2016, said the Land Transport Authority.</p>

              <p>You have to consider the cost of living as well ... take the ratio of the median income, or the price of an average meal (for example), against the public transport fares. The idea is relative affordability. Simply applying based on exchange rates is not very accurate.</p>

              <p>problem is the revenue collected wont be enough to cover the cost of the total cost of 12 packages under the GCM model.... so if dun raise bus fares, Gov will have to raise GST or other taxes to recover back the shortfall..... </p>
              <p>already mention before that each package cost $100 mil yearly x 12 packages will be 1200 million that LTA have to pay to the operators... but revenve for SBST/SMRT from bus operations is around 1000 million yearly.. so there is shortfall of $200 mil yearly. further, LTA still have to pay for the cost of buying buses/building depots etc....</p>

              <p>problem is the revenue collected wont be enough to cover the
              cost of the total cost of 12 packages under the GCM model.... so if
              dun raise bus fares, Gov will have to raise GST or other taxes to
              recover back the shortfall..... </p>
              <p>already mention before that each package cost $100 mil yearly x
              12 packages will be 1200 million that LTA have to pay to the
              operators... but revenve for SBST/SMRT from bus operations is
              around 1000 million yearly.. so there is shortfall of $200 mil
              yearly. further, LTA still have to pay for the cost of buying
              buses/building depots etc....</p>
