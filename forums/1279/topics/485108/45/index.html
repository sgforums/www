              <p>That is long overdue. It is a problem the industry has continually denied for years. And nobody is willing to admit that they should be paying higher fares to cope with the costs of buying new buses and recruiting sufficient bus drivers.</p>
              <p>Also, it makes no sense to me when LTA is <a href="http://www.marketing-interactive.com/pitches-market-nac-lta-looks-agencies/">contracting a marketing agency to create recruitment ads</a>!</p>

              <p>I hope so...the lobbyists have a very different idea on the livery.</p>
              <p>As far as I know, Transit Systems never had their own livery design on bus operations anywhere else. Their standard practice is to stick the logo/name above the door/driver cab (photos above).</p>

              <p>That has the potential to get messy, unless they adopt a unified fleet numbering (as in Perth and Sydney, photos above).</p>

              <p>Sorry lor. You think the government do not know there will be
              people who will take advantage of this, by not applying to the new
              company early and only apply when the new company decides to
              increase the salary?</p>
              <p>Even if increase, there is also a limit to it.</p>
              <p>If there is not enough manpower for the new company, the
              government would probably intervene and force the existing company
              to transfer some of its people to the new company.</p>

              <p>In other words, LTA should lenient the license Class listing and since most of the big public buses are using Auto gear, they should also consider special license permit for those holding Class 3A, so that in the worst case scenario, there is still some hope from this 3A group.</p>
              <p>Suggesting the a special permit license, listed as Class 4B(Only for Class 3A holders). Same rules apply as to Class 4A, which means this special license has to be returned upon leaving the company.</p>
