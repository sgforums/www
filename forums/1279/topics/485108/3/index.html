              <p>Since all the bus assets are gonna be owned by the government
                              from 2016 onwards, meaning SBST and SMRT may soon go into
                              history. </p>
              <p>The companies will still be there, but there will be a unified
                              LTA livery if im not wrong. Which means to say, whether it is SBS
                              or SMRT buses, depending on tender, you may see the current SBS
                              buses doing SMRT services and vice versa. </p>
              <p>Correct me if im wrong here. </p>
              <p>Actually, if u take a closer look about it, isn't this very much
                              like nationalising public transport? </p>

              <p>In short, yes. It is possible for current SBS Transit buses to run on current SMRT Buses routes in future, and vice-versa.</p>
              <p>There is indeed a lot of comment from the public that this looks like a nationalisation of public transport, and the timing is too coincidental (election year).</p>
              <p>On a related (or unrelated) note, SMRT intends to sell its rail assets of the two oldest MRT lines back to government:</p>

              <p>For bus enthuasists, this is effectively GAME OVER. This is
              almost similar to the Transperth model.</p>
              <p>In Perth, Public Transport Authority has secured a contract to
              buy Volvo buses with Volgren bodywork exclusively for a decade
              (taking over from Mercedes-Benz). If LTA also decides to take up
              only one supplier as PTA does, tough luck.</p>

              <p>The Australian cities in which the government order buses for the bus network are Adelaide (Scania) and Perth (Volvo). Melbourne and Sydney allow operators to choose the buses they want to use.</p>

              so i guess we'd be seeing SBS,TIB,SMB rego buses operated by others soon. 
              would there be 1 common uniform for bus captains? salary issued by LTA?; since LTA collects all the revenue. hopefully LTA can further raise their salaries comparable to average taxi driver earnings to attract more locals to join. hope LTA buy more bendies for SBST operated feeder routes.

              <p>nope. i read the newspapers today and i saw that they might adopt the london system where common livery across all buses. that is also the reason why the downtown line was not painted SBS Transit livery in the first place, although operated by SBS Transit. </p>
              <p>Hence, i think the livery will all be changed to common LTA livery. </p>
              <p>80% of the routes will be under sbs/smrt until 2022, as first 3 packages(20% of the routes)  of bus services will be tendered out from 2016, and these bus services may or may not stay under sbs or smrt. </p>

              <p>No, payroll is still under operators. The operators will receive a sum for the contract from LTA, and the operator will sort out the HR.</p>
              <p>It is unlikely that they will have a common uniform because that is a visible method to differentate between operators. You must remember that Transperth and London Buses come from the other direction (from a nationalised entity to a privatised industry), and Transperth's common uniform is actually a legacy component. Their staff badges are prominently different and large to reflect this operator differentation.</p>

              <p>It is all about money. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is because SBS Transit and SMRT are suffering monetary losses in the current model, that's why the Government wants to replace it with the Bus Contracts Model. </span></p>

              <p>Therefore, I shall take back my opinions that both SBS Transit and SMRT may wind down and merge with other companies. Nope, I doubt they will close down. Instead, SBS Transit will simply scale down its business to reduce costs and make profits, while SMRT may follow suit, and perhaps improve the service standards at the remainder of its business - including bus. I do not think SMRT will give up its bus business. Rather, I think it will only scale down. -<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> before making a comeback in future </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">by bidding for more bus routes (and if it wins the bus contracts). </span></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that through buying<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> the vehicles (probably at net book value/costs price after depreciation, to ensure that this is fair to the people paying tax money) from SBS Transit and SMRT, the government is actually reimbursing money to the two companies, which would help the two companies reduce their losses and accelerate their loss-recovery process, so that they can quickly turnover and make profits, to push for service improvements.</span></p>
              <p>Well, it may seem that the government is giving our tax money away to SBS Transit and SMR<span style="line-height: 1.231;">T to buy their buses</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, but if you think about it, this way is actually cheaper than if the government buys its own buses as a start-up to this bus contracts model. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(<em>in fact, who is one having majority shares in SBS Transit and SMRT, and has all along been contributing most to the funding</em></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em> of bus purchases?)(so isn't this just a transfer of money from one pocket to another, which would have no impact on our tax money?</em>) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The actual costs is actually just the</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> money spent on re-painting buses, re-fitting bus interiors, etc. - which can be recovered through other aspects</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> such as making more spaces available for advertising, instead of tax.</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, moving on in this bus contracts model, the government will be the one <span style="line-height: 1.231;">paying for the new buses in future, using the tax we pay.

              <p>Haha I agree. SBS Transit and SMRT could have find other alternatives themselves way back already as they are making losses year after year. I think they are just waiting for the government to take this step so that they can be relieved from these losses and can answer to the shareholders. </p>
              <p>However, as much as i think the government is making a good move, it comes way too late. It seems like the BSEP spendings are unnecessary now and wasted money. They could have acquired all bus operations in 2011 and start doing their own bus planning and resources allocation from there then and things may not have escalated so much. While I understand the bus routes are currently binded by contracts still Aug 2016. Well, in anyway, its all about timing, elections coming, really. And the implementation of the this contract system is gonna happen in 2016, coincidentally, the election year. While I dont want to speculate if this has anything to do about elections, you guys judge yourself. </p>
              <p>Regarding fares, i highly doubt it will be lower. You know, fares will only go up or stay the same. =D</p>

              <p>The government also has to be vary of the sustainability of the operators bidding for these packages.</p>

              <p>It is all about money. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It
              is because SBS Transit and SMRT are suffering monetary losses in
              the current model, that's why the Government wants to replace it
              with the Bus Contracts Model. </span></p>
              <p>Actually, if Comfort Delgro wants to merge SBS Transit's bus
              business with its other subsidiary (comfortdelgro bus) or with
              itself (the main company), to make it more financially viable to
              t<span style="line-height: 1.231;">he comfortdelgro
              company, </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">it would
              have done it long ago, since SBS Transit's bus business has all
              along been suffering losses. B</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ut somehow, it does not want to do
              it. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Likewise, SMRT
              could have already sold off its bus business to other companies,
              but it did not.</span> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I guess
              this is because both SBS Transit and SMRT know that the losses they
              suffer now in their bus business is only for now, and that their
              bus business will soon make profits when the current model is
              replaced with the new Bus Contracts Model.</span></p>
              <p>Therefore, I shall take back my opinions that both SBS Transit
              and SMRT may wind down and merge with other companies. Nope, I
              doubt they will close down. Instead, SBS Transit will simply scale
              down its business to reduce costs and make profits, while SMRT may
              follow suit, and perhaps improve the service standards at the
              remainder of its business - including bus. I do not think SMRT will
              give up its bus business. Rather, I think it will only scale down.
              -<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> before making a comeback
              in future </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">by bidding
              for more bus routes (and if it wins the bus
              contracts). </span></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that through buying<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> the vehicles (probably at net book
              value/costs price after depreciation, to ensure that this is fair
              to the people paying tax money) from SBS Transit and SMRT, the
              government is actually reimbursing money to the two companies,
              which would help the two companies reduce their losses and
              accelerate their loss-recovery process, so that they can quickly
              turnover and make profits, to push for service
              improvements.</span></p>
              <p>Well, it may seem that the government is giving our tax money
              away to SBS Transit and SMR<span style="line-height: 1.231;">T to
              buy their buses</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, but if
              you think about it, this way is actually cheaper than if the
              government buys its own buses as a start-up to this bus contracts
              model. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(<em>in fact,
              who is one having majority shares in SBS Transit and SMRT, and has
              all along been contributing most to the
              funding</em></span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><em> of
              bus purchases?)(so isn't this just a transfer of money from one
              pocket to another, which would have no impact on our tax
              money?</em>) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The
              actual costs is actually just the</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> money spent on re-painting buses,
              re-fitting bus interiors, etc. - which can be recovered through
              other aspects</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> such as
              making more spaces available for advertising, instead of
              tax.</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, moving on in this bus contracts model, the government
              will be the one <span style="line-height: 1.231;">paying for
              the new buses in future, using the tax we pay. So
              since </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">we would be the
              one paying</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> for the
              buses (through tax)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, I
              believe the government will only charge us bus fares to pay for the
              petrol/diesel, electricity and wages, among the other costs besides
              those spent on buying the buses. Thus, we can somehow expect lower
              bus fares in future. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>In the <a title="press release" href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=28fca09a-bed6-48f4-99d4-18eeb8c496bd">press release</a>, LTA say that under the Bus Contracts Model, the bus companies "will be paid fees to operate the services, while fare revenue will be retained by the Government". <span style="line-height: 1.231;">In today's edition of The Straits Times, there are two articles which mentioned that "the revenue, however, is likely to fall short" (page A1) as taking reference from City Direct, "the LTA has been able to recover only 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the contract cost throguh fare collection" (page A6), thus the government may "have to increase the amount of subsidies it currently puts into public bus services" (page A1). </span></p>
                      <p>Personally, I feel that there are other ways the government can do to recover the contract costs that is not recovered in fare collection. For instance, since LTA will be taking over the bus interchanges, terminals and depots, it can lease the retail spaces in the facilities to collect rental, and create spaces in the facilities (walls, floor, exterior, etc.) for advertising to collect advertising fees. It can also allow people to paste advertisements on the public buses, then collect advertising fees from them, since LTA will own the buses. Collecting/Increasing subsidies is not the only way to recover whatever that is not recovered in fare collection. In fact, I feel that collecting/increasing subsidies (and increasing bus fares) should be done only at last resort, if after it has tried all other means to recover whatever that is not recovered in fare collection the costs is still not recovered. #justsaying</p>
