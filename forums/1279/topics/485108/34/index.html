              <p>personally, I am worried about feeder bus services that currently operate at frequencies lower than 6-8 minutes.</p>
              <p>For instance, 241, 243, 334 and 285 in Jurong West, Jurong East and Clementi.</p>
              <p>Likewise, about trunk bus services that currently operate below the maximum frequency of 15 minutes (during peak hours). </p>
              <p>For instance, 179. Apparently, only 179. I cannot seem to find any trunk bus service that operates at frequency below 10 minutes. Well, maybe the other one is 181. but, it's really very few la... so, maybe the best is to introduce new bus services to patch up a bit? :/</p>
              <p>whereas for the feeder bus services that may be affected, maybe should also introduce new feeder bus services to patch up.</p>

              <p>Yes, but the scoring for the quality aspect is subjective and more variable. The shortlisted tenderers, including SBST and SMRT, would have at least fulfilled the basic svc requirements (under quality aspect), but the fact that SMRT didn't win suggests that the criteria is likely more skewed towards the quality aspect. Anyway, proposals on paper and track records are one thing, but we'll have to wait and see how Tower Transit actually manages the bus svcs.</p>
              <p>I believe the buses to be used for the Bulim Package would all come from BSEP buses currently under SBST and SMRT, and would be re-deployed from BSEP svcs and BSEP fleet adds. These are already LTA's assets and can easily be handed to the new operator, while non-BSEP buses would be re-deployed on SBST and SMRT BSEP routes, with ownership transferred to LTA. This fleet standardisation (A22s, Citaros, Wrights, possibly Enviros) would also be easier for the new operator rather than having to deal with older models as well, e.g. the KUBs and OCs.</p>
              <p>With regards to the livery, we could have something similar to the DTL trains' livery, with LTA corporate colours and logo, although these are less obvious on the underground MRT line. LTA may also opt for a less direct approach by using Transitlink as a unifying name for public bus svcs.</p>
              <p>Buses for other bus packages (including the 9 to be operated by SBST/SMRT for the time being) are likely to get the new livery when their transition comes. This essentially means that SMRT's new livery and corporate colours were a short-lived PR exercise to assert their ownership while they could.</p>

              <p>This is just an interim measure, they have sped up the process for restickering buses into the new PTV livery, its not just Transdev's fleet which has been restickered, but Ventura, CDC and several regional Victorian operators. How else do you want them to present their buses when the takeover (and transition to contract based system) has just occurred. Furthermore, while livery serves as an identifier for buses to the public, the main concern is still the operation of the buses, and it would take a while before relivery is completed. </p>
              <p>Admittedly they took slower than expected to resticker their buses to the new livery but there are no more bubble buses in Transdev's fleet with the Ventura blue livery, and most of the fleet has been done.</p>
              <p>Expect the same thing to occur for this Jurong East package.</p>
