              <p>You're referring to the intratown routes in Yishun and Woodlands, namely 811, 812, 911, 912 and 913. Similar to SBST's townlink svcs (in AMK, Pasir Ris, Tampines etc), these bus routes were formed by combining 2 feeder svcs that serve diff parts of the estate together, thus providing connections from one end of the estate to another (eg Woodlands checkpoint to Admiralty area), without the need to transfer buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. That's partly why LTA introduced the peak period short services, though another reason is to further test the feasibility of contracting bus routes to pte operators. Since these P svcs are likely to be subsumed under the contract for the routes in the respective area, they may be repackaged as shortworking trips for these intratown/townlink svcs.</p>
              <p>2. Agreed, another reason why some of the P svcs only serve one loop for the intratown/townlink svcs, instead of both loops.</p>
              <p>3. This is a legacy issue, a result of the former bus terminal being located at Woodlands checkpoint, before the new Woodlands regional interchange opened.</p>

              <p>obviously u did not go see the real situation at the interchange on how they deploy these intratown buses.... how often does WDL and YIS have traffic congestion??</p>
              <p>and based on your point 3, all these buses should not call at interchange as well since it is a duplication of resources?? u did not see the crowds that are travelling on 911/912/913 to woodland checkpoint??</p>

              <p>I do not know about Woodlands and Yishun areas, but from my experience in Jurong West where there is a high number of commuters travelling intra-town, to Bukit Batok, Clementi, Choa Chu Kang and Tuas, I guess there are many commuters travelling intra-town from every town in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Well, w<span style="line-height: 1.231;">hat I meant is that the </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">two-in-one feeder bus services at Woodlands and Yishun should be split into two, and the two large groups (feeder and intra-town) of commuters should be separated - with a 100% feeder bus service for commuters going to MRT and a 100% intra-town (trunk) bus service for commuters travelling intra-town.</span></p>
              <p>Benefits of splitting a two-in-one feeder bus service into two feeder bus services:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First</span>, <strong>there can be better allocation of buses</strong> as it would be more clear which area needs more buses. As mentioned, this would prevent wastage of bus resources as only the area that requires more buses would have more buses.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second</span>, there can be better management of buses, since the coverage is smaller and there are less buses to manage per feeder bus service. <strong>It is easier for the bus company to manage the frequency and reliability of the feeder bus service</strong> when the route is shorter.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>Benefits of separating two large groups (feeder and intra-town) of commuters apart:</div>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First</span>, this would reduce the number of commuters on board a feeder bus and improve the feeder bus connectivity for commuters who only want to commute to a MRT station and continue their journey on the MRT, as <strong>the chances of getting onto a feeder bus would be higher</strong>.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second</span>, for the commuters who travel intra-town, besides having a higher probability of getting a seat on the bus, <strong>commuters travelling intra-town can get to their destination in a shorter time</strong>, as they would not have to stop at the bus interchange along the way.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third</span>, since this would increase the number of commuters on board intra-town bus services and reduce the number on board feeder bus services, it would mean that LTA can generate more revenue and reduce the reliance on subsidies (which part of it comes from the tax we pay) to recover the costs of operating public bus services that is not recovered by the revenue generated.</span></li>

After the event, I was to go to somewhere else in Yishun, so I commuted on a bus service - but in the wrong direction. Instead of bringing me directly to a particular destination in Yishun, the bus went around another area and made a stop at Yishun Bus Interchange, before going to that particular destination in Yishun. It was bus 811, by the way. It was because of this experience I had that's why I feel that the two-in-one feeder bus services at Yishun and Woodlands should be split into two. (I know, this is not related to the 5 reasons I gave, but it is this that I realised the bus services at Yishun may not be as good as in Jurong West, and I am suggesting how it can be improved.)</p>

              <p>There is a recent case study in Macau to explore the possible mistakes of a competitive bus tender system. Under this system, ownership of buses were retained by the companies but fare revenue was taken over by the government. This system was implemented on August 2011 (and resulting in the addition of a new operator, making a total of three operators). What has happened since?</p>
              <p>- Many of the existing fleet were retired on August 2011. Some buses as young as 8 years old were out of the fleet altogether.</p>
              <p>- Many routes switched hands. Because all changes took place in one day,
               there was chaos on day one. Reolian had a shortage of drivers, 
              resulting in disruption of services and the other two companies were 
              pulled in to help.</p>
              <p>- Because the main consideration was costs, the three operators bought China buses. It is possible that the operators tried to undercut each other to get the contracts. Almost all public buses in Macau are now Chinese brands. Residents particularly did not like the design of Reolian's minibuses, and this affected their perception of the operator.</p>
              <p>- The public considered the system negatively, and in particular saw the newcomer Reolian to be the worst amongst the three. The drivers were deemed to be dangerous and unprofessional. Some commuters found that their choice of operators actually reduced (now being served by one operator only, and though stuck with Reolian were very unhappy). Commuters were unwilling to switch to public transport.</p>
              <p>- Reolian was forced to increase wages by 30% to attract sufficient drivers. However they were inadequately trained and pushed onto service quickly.</p>
              <p>- The new third operator, Reolian, eventually went bankrupt in October 2013. The government had to take over operations. (Classic case of <span class="st">privatizing profits and socializing losses</span>).</p>
              <p>A Masters thesis <a href="http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/182290">was dedicated to this subject</a> (which some of these information was derived from) and makes for very interesting reading.</p>

              <div class="st2014-byline">By Bruno Wildermuth For The Straits Times</div>
              <div id="st2014-content" class="st2014-content">
              <p>In the past, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) had 
              failed to properly separate the regulatory function from its other 
              functions, such as building the rail systems.</p>
              <p>Instead, it had often held the operators responsible for 
              faults that were clearly the result of poor quality control during 
              construction and a clear lack of stringent acceptance-testing 
              procedures.</p>
              <p>With the new bus-contracting model, a good way to separate 
              the two functions will be to have the regulatory function assigned to 
              another, independent entity, such as the Ministry of Transport.</p>
              <p>One missing feature that can be incorporated into the 
              bus-contracting model is published and strictly adhered-to timetables 
              for the bus services.</p>
              <p>All major cities in the world operate bus services on 
              published timetables. This requires that 100 per cent of the services be
               performed.</p>
              <p>Currently, the LTA lets operators get away with performing only 96 per cent of the scheduled trips without a penalty.</p>
              <p>As a result, operators do not have any standby drivers in 
              case one of the scheduled drivers reports sick or otherwise fails to 
              show up. Instead, the scheduled frequency is then adjusted for the 
              reduced number of buses operated.</p>
              <p>In order to properly monitor timetable adherence, timing stops need to be identified and strictly monitored.</p>
              <p>This can be done with the analysis of the ez-link database and does not require any costly, high-technology systems.</p>
              <p>Examples of this approach can readily be found in Australian cities visited by the Ministry of Transport.</p>
              <p>The MRT was originally designed to provide basic service for
               the heavy movements in major corridors where rail service is far more 
              efficient than bus services. To that extent, even improved bus services 
              will not be able to replace the MRT.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the lack of proper attention by the LTA to 
              the upgrading needs of the original MRT North-South and East-West lines,
               such as the long overdue replacement of the outdated signalling system,
               have caused the MRT's current lack of adequate capacity and hence 
              popularity.</p>
              <p>The LTA will have to prove its capability to plan for more 
              appropriate bus services, given that the current routes are anything but
               efficient and often far too long to operate reliably. The LTA needs to 
              find the relevant talent to plan better bus services.</p>
              <p>With the LTA planning the bus routes and presumably the 
              required frequency of service, who will be responsible for determining a
               realistic and achievable timetable and hence the required number of 
              buses?</p>
              <p>Will it be the LTA or the bus operator bidding for the route?</p>
              <p>This is an important issue that does not seem to have been addressed by the LTA's announced changes.</p>
              <p>If the LTA establishes the timetable, which then turns out not to be achievable, then who will hold the LTA responsible?</p>
              <p>If the task is to be part of the bus operator bidding for 
              the contract, then the LTA will need to provide all the necessary data 
              available to establish a realistic and achievable timetable. A clear 
              indication of the process is required from LTA.</p>

              <div class="st2014-byline">By Park Byung Joon For The Straits Times</div>
              <div id="st2014-content" class="st2014-content">
              <p>AS A long-time advocate of the implementation of a full
               operating subsidy model for the public bus services in Singapore, I was
               delighted to read that the Government is moving to a bus-contracting 
              model.</p>
              <p>Under this model, the Government takes over the ownership of
               buses and assets, and contracts the running of bus routes to private 
              bus operators for a fee. Fare revenue goes to the Government.</p>
              <p>This is different from the current public transport model 
              where the Government pays for and provides the infrastructure, such as 
              railways and bus depots. The Government thus subsidises capital spending
               in public transport, especially for the MRT train system.</p>
              <p>But these assets are held by the public transport operator, 
              which has to pay operating expenses and the cost of depreciation for 
              trains and buses. The operator recoups these in the form of fare 
              revenue. In this way, it is ultimately the commuting public that pays 
              these costs.</p>
              <p>But commuters could expect only a level of service that the 
              fare revenue could pay for. It has become increasingly obvious that the 
              public demands a higher level of service than what is available with the
               current fare levels.</p>
              <p>The concept of public transport has also evolved. No longer 
              regarded simply as a service for people who do not own private vehicles,
               public transportation is also vital for the nation's economy and social
               integration. Once this latter concept is accepted, the idea that the 
              Government should fund public transport whenever necessary should be 
              embraced.</p>
              <p>There are many ways that taxpayers' money can be used. One 
              is to simply inject public money into private operators and hope, or 
              pray, that they will spend the money wisely.</p>
              <p>Another way is to nationalise public transport. In this 
              model, the Government does not just own infrastructure and assets. It 
              also takes on the responsibility of operating public transport on a 
              daily basis.</p>
              <p>Among the models available to policymakers, I believe the 
              full operating subsidy model - known in Singapore as the government 
              contracting model - is the best approach.</p>
              <p>Under a nationalised public transport scheme, the Government
               must prepare daily operation plans, maintenance schedules, the 
              recruitment of bus drivers and so on.</p>
              <p>Some criticise this model on the grounds that it leads to 
              the undesirable intrusion of Big Government. An equally important issue,
               perhaps, is whether it is practicable. It is always better if the 
              relevant minister does not have to worry about whether there are enough 
              bus drivers to run the system on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>Under the government contracting model, however, the 
              Government only needs to set the desired service level for the bus 
              service and to evaluate the chosen operator based on the pre-specified 
              quality standard. The details of running bus services will be the 
              responsibility of the operator which offers the best price for 
              delivering the service level specified by the Government.</p>
              <p>If we believe in the power of the free market, we can be 
              reasonably confident that competition among operators from all over the 
              world will give the Government, and eventually Singaporean taxpayers, 
              the best service and best price (or at least, something very close to 
              it).</p>
              <p>At the same time, however, it is important that local 
              officials have the tools necessary to ensure that the system works 
              smoothly.</p>
              <p>The role of the Public Transport Council (PTC) may need to 
              be expanded beyond setting fares. After all, the service level required 
              of bus operators will be higher than what can be afforded by fare 
              revenue alone. The difference between the two will have to be borne by 
              the Government.</p>
              <p>If commuters pay lower fares, taxpayers will have to pay 
              more to cover higher public subsidies. Through the fare adjustment 
              exercise, the PTC will determine the portions recovered via fare revenue
               and taxpayers' top-up.</p>
              <p>A fundamental truth in life is that we get what we pay for. 
              The bill that taxpayers have to pick up could be huge. There must 
              therefore be a mechanism by which a consensus can be reached on the 
              desired level of service and how it will be financed.</p>
              <p>In addition to the fare adjustment exercise, the PTC may 
              have to take on the vital role of striking a balance between the desired
               service level and the price people have to pay.</p>
