              Dunno why but Scania suit with Voith gearbox best..The old N113CRB with Voith also accelerate well..Less vibrate...probably its 5 cylinders nature...

              <p>A couple of months back, we touched on the new model and why this should hypothetically result in <a href="http://blog.moneysmart.sg/opinion/heres-why-singaporeans-should-demand-lower-fares-with-the-governments-new-transportation-restructuring/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">lower bus fares across the board</span></span></a>. Or at least, this is something commuters should demand and expect. The recent discussion in Parliament highlighted concerns on whether or not this new contracting bus model will be financially sustainable and how much taxpayers’ money it will require to run.</p>
              <p>Just an extremely quick summary for the few that are unsure of what is going on: The Singapore Government is going to purchase all bus assets and infrastructure and contract out the services of operating the bus routes to outside contractors. Prior study of other systems in London and Australia have shown that this system has proven successful in increasing standards of bus service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>That’s What He (Lui) Said</h4>
              <p>Addressing the concerns raised in Parliament, Lui Tuck Yew mentioned that in order to make the new model sustainable, regular fare increases would be needed and new routes cancelled if there aren’t enough passengers after some months.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui said: <em>“The eventual amount of subsidy will crucially depend on whether fares and bus service standards are set realistically. Regardless of industry model, the cost of the overall bus system has to be paid for either by commuters in the form of fares or by taxpayers in the form of Government subsidies.”</em></p>
              <p>He also mentioned: <em>“There is surely no free lunch… The Government is committed to ensure the affordability of public transport fares. However, regular fare adjustments are still necessary to ensure the overall financial sustainability of the public transport system.”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Lui also added that a new route could be tested for a few months and if the required passenger volume is not met, then the authorities may have to “sometimes make the painful decision to cut that route and eliminate it”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>What We Think</h4>
              <p>The few times that I’ve been to an event with an MP around, I’ve not seen anyone run up to them and point a gun to their head insisting that they create a bus route that brings them from obscure point A to obscure point B. If transport routes need to be cut due to a lack of sustainability, is anyone really going to lose their head over that as opposed to fares increasing across the board?</p>
              <p>Also, whenever this debate on “financial sustainability” goes up, am I the only one who thinks they’re really talking about “financial profitability”?</p>
              <p>Face it, Mr Lui. People are ALWAYS going to ask for more bus routes. When I was young, I wanted a slide from my bedroom window that led into the swimming pool (except I didn’t have a swimming pool). The look on my parents’ face led me to conclude that 1. It was a stupid suggestion and 2. It was never going to happen because of various logistical and, more importantly, financial barriers.</p>
              <p>I’m not saying that requests for bus routes are stupid, but if they hamper the overall financial sustainability (NOT profitability) of the system, how hard is it to put that on hold? Also, here’s another suggestion which we’ve made plenty of times: How about GETTING THE DAMN TRAINS TO WORK? Or actually completing a new MRT line on time?</p>
              <p>We’re going to take a look at Singapore’s public transport system as a whole and see how it compares to other countries in a cute little infographic, so <a href="https://www.facebook.com/moneysmartsg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">follow us on Facebook</span></span></a> as we release that later this week!</p>
              <p style="color: #000000;">Mr Lui said: <em>“If you operate more and more new routes and the ridership is low, the Government and, indirectly, the taxpayer, take on the burden of making sure it is financially sustainable,”</em></p>
              <p style="color: #000000;">So I’m supposed to pay for your inability to say no? No thanks.</p>
              <p style="color: #000000;"> </p>
              <h4 style="color: #000000;">A Question of Necessity vs Sustainability</h4>
              <p>Now, we definitely have no perspective on how the Land Transport Authority (LTA) assesses routes or how they determine whether a route should survive or not. Heck, we don’t even know if they are really assessing routes on a measure of sustainability or a margin of profit. But the fact remains that there may be some routes which are a necessity to a significant amount of people, but not an amount significant enough to make that route sustainable.</p>
              <p>What happens then? The bus route gets cancelled, while the people who end up suffering are also taxpayers supporting this entire transportation machine? And if fares get hiked and their particular bus route gets cancelled, then they end up paying higher fares overall for the same, longer bus route that they had to take originally.</p>
              <p>A potential solution to that would be to increase the fares for that particular route, ala Express buses, in accordance or at least pegged to a certain degree to the cost of taking a more convoluted route. The bottom line is that we are sick of hearing transport companies turn huge profits at the expense of the consumer, while we have to spend 1 hour on a crowded bus hoping that our phone battery lasts long enough to entertain us for the duration of the miserable trip.</p>
              <p>The eventual ideal is that LTA gets their act together and sorts out the MRT lines sooner rather than later, and buses primarily serve as feeder services and <em>then </em>LTA can look at more obscure routes to help those in need of a more optimised service.</p>

              <p>Bro, i written v much earlier in this thread tt in the bus contracting model, fares will go up, there was nev a chance fares stay stagnant.</p>
              <p>Cost pressures in SG will always lead to increase in price. Furthermore there is an artificial min wage in the cleaning sector wic has also been implemented in the public transport sector.</p>
              <p>There is inefficiency in bus operations in SG now, on weekends, there are a number if services still running at v high freq w low ridership during the day, eg, sv10,76,196 runs at 9/10mins. If PTOs still dun now how to manage, they have themselves to blame for not managing well.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui, sadly inherited this mess from his predecessors, Mssrs Yeow,Mah and he has to clean up. This lack of foresight is inherent in most MIW policies... Just look at the Lift upgrading programme for older estates and rising medical costs and the cap in number of medical students enrolled at NUS, shortage of hosital beds, ramp up construction of HDB flats which is being sold at a higher price and many other policies</p>

              <p>It is similar in most cities. Buses in peak hours are expected to be at least completely seated. There is no free ride. I am not saying it has to be fully seated end to end, but buses that just take 20-25 pax in peak hours are a waste of resources. Either you change the route to better utilize those resources or give it to another deserving service. That is the big flaw in the BSEP that it has failed to identify and correct inefficiencies in the bus network.</p>
              <p>to list a few: multiple buses having same route while people in other estates have very limited options.</p>

              <p>Acx1688, nice thoughts. But if people are not prepared to see up
              to 25-min headways on such services on off-peak hours like what
              KMB, CTB and NWFB is doing, then there is no cost to be cut. In
              fact, if the utilisation rate does not justify a trip in HK, they
              would rather park the bus at the bus interchange. Trip supply is
              tightly tied to trip demand, and every trip should at least be
              fully seated.</p>

              <p>Seems like SBST knows why all their routes have a purpose in running... 120 already okay, no need to withdraw. I still see some people (around 6 - 7) taking the bus from Telok Blangah Hts to Alexandra Road and so on at around 9p.m... And connections are important when you have bus routes, that's why it makes sense when you say 18 should stay. Because you mentioned the connection and why it justifies its existence...</p>

              <p>Not really.. U have 168 w/ very good frequency to get you to Bedok. For some blocks along ave 7 walking distance to 168 or a quick transfer to 28 or 168. If you observe Sv 18 it has a frequency of 15-18 mins, when people can find better travel option. Also see the loading. Around 25-30 pax in peak hours (most of who can also take Sv 8 or av 21 to Bedok Reservoir rd from ave 7. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, withdraw sbs 18 and sbs 115??? Bedok north rd and bedok nth ave 2 residents lost a service sbs 18 just like this? You want the aged residents there to suffer by walking? Sbs 115 is only limited hours and timing is quite short. You want the residents at hougang ave 1 and 3 to suffer too? Many are elderly who cannot walk far. You got see the demographic patterns of those living in these 2 places? Don't just blindly say withdraw. Some bus services are meant to have lesser loadings than others. You cannot expect loadings to be high or medium for all services. Sbs transit realized the needs for these 2 services and has adjusted frequency to meet the needs of certain residents. They will not be so dumb to have super high frequencies for these 2 bus services. Sbs 18 is about 15 to 18 min for 1 bus and sbs 115 is about 30 to 50 min for 1 bus. Some elderly know the timings for sbs 115 and waited patiently about 10 min beforehand for sbs 115. You really want to withdraw? Cheers.</p>

              <p>Why would anyone <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">except the elderly who find it far to walk there and people who are lazy to walk opp to take 113 would</span></em> wait for 115 when there's a 113 coming frequently at hg ave 1?? Even the foreign workers would take 113 from their dorms at ave 3 to kovan and back instead of waiting for 115. Cheers~ </p>
              <p>115 will have a fleet add this coming week and there's only 1 bus bay at hg st 21 terminal. </p>
              <p>As for Sv 18's deployment can cut 1 bus and adjust runtime~ Yes it cannot be withdrawn but still it can be amended~</p>
