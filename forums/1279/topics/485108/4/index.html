Introduction<br>Londonâ€Ÿs bus network is unique in the mainland United Kingdom in that it is regulated. This enables Transport for London to plan, procure and manage a network of services in a consistent and co-ordinated manner. This system, along with adequate funding and collaborative working with other organisations has lead to increased service levels, improved quality of services and significant increases in patronage. Bus operators compete for contracts to provide specified services for up to seven years, and are rewarded for exceeding defined targets to improve the service to our passengers. Their role is crucial to the current and future success of bus transport in London. The tendering and contracting arrangements are designed to deliver value for money, balancing the expectations of our passengers against the costs of improvements. A London Assembly Transport Committee scrutiny of bus contracts in March 2006 recognised that the London bus network represents value for money. Transport for London is committed to promoting fair and sustained competition to provide bus services in market that is dynamic and unique. This document explains our bus service tendering and contracting process and we look forward to further developing and building on its already proven success.<br>Page 4<br>2. The Market in London – overview<br>London Bus Services Limited (London Buses) is part of Transport for London (TfL) which is one of the organisations responsible for delivering the Mayor of Londonâ€Ÿs Transport Strategies. London Buses manages bus services in London. It plans routes, specifies service levels and ensures service quality. It is also responsible for bus stations, bus stops and other support services. The bus services are operated by privately owned operating companies, which work under contract to London Buses. Every weekday over 7,000 scheduled buses carry over six million passengers on approximately 700 different routes. Over 100 of those routes run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The network is dynamic and responds to London's growth and changing transport needs. Every year up to a fifth of the total bus service is re-tendered, with around half of the network subject to some level of review. Buses are widely recognised as the best option for increasing public transport capacity in the short-term. Many initiatives are in place to make journeys as easy, reliable, quick, convenient, comfortable and affordable as possible. The following figures demonstrate how much the bus network has developed in the last few years: Bus ridership has grown by 68% per cent between 1999/2000 and 2007/08 Buses in London now carry the highest number of passengers since 1962 In the year to March 2008, there were 2.18 billion passenger trips on the network Bus kilometers in London is higher than at any time since 1957, with 468 million km operated in 2007/8<br>Page 5<br>3. Purpose and Structure of key organisations in London’s bus tendering process<br>3.1. Historical and Political Situation<br>When London's urban public transport was brought together in 1933 with the support of the London Passenger Transport Board, bus services covered a vast area. At the time, they served much of what is now Greater London, as well as areas in many of the adjacent counties, up to around 35 miles distance from Central London. From 1970 to 1984, London Transport (LT) came under the direct control of the Greater London Council (GLC) and the area for which LT was legally responsible was also reduced to the present 1,580 sq km (610 sq miles). Cross boundary links were retained and the GLC and county councils took decisions on the funding of those services. Under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, LT was again brought under central government control. The Act required LT to set up subsidiary companies to run both buses and the Underground. It also stipulated that, where appropriate, competitive tendering should be introduced to ensure LT operated economically and required less financial assistance from public funds. In 1986, bus services outside London were deregulated. This meant that any licensed operator could decide to run a new route even if another company already ran a service along the same roads. Although London was exempted, it was intended that once bus services in the capital had become less dependent on government assistance and steps had been taken to encourage greater competition between operators, deregulation would be extended to include London. In 1985, LT set up a subsidiary known as London Buses Limited (LBL) to run its bus services. However, route planning and fare structures remained the responsibility of LT. In the same year, LT set up the Tendered Bus Division to begin the process of competitive tendering. This required LBL to compete against privately owned operators for the opportunity to run individual bus routes on behalf of LT. The routes were awarded to the operator which could run the best service at the most cost-effective price, and about 40% of the initial contracts were awarded to private companies rather than LBL. It also led to another change as buses began appearing on London's streets in liveries that were not traditional LT red. As a step towards the planned deregulation of services, LBL created 13 locally based subsidiary companies, each with its own commercial remit.<br>Page 6<br>These companies conducted their own wage negotiations, took appropriate steps to reduce their overheads and competed against each other, as well as private companies, for the contracts to run LT bus routes. The subsidiaries became increasingly successful in competing for routes. In December 1992, the government announced that the LBL operating companies would be sold into the private sector ahead of deregulation. However, a year later, it decided to postpone deregulation until after the General Election in May 1997, although the sale of the operating companies to the private sector was completed in 1994. The Labour government, elected in 1997, was committed to reintroducing a strategic governing authority for London. In July 2000, London Transport was replaced by a new organisation called Transport for London (TfL).<br>3.2. Legal and Statutory Framework<br>Transport for London and London Bus Services Ltd (London Buses) are required to comply with a number of UK and European statutes and regulations. Some of the key obligations for the provision of bus services are detailed in this section. The Mayor and the Greater London Authority have a duty to develop and implement policies for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities to, from and within Greater London under Section 141 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (GLA Act). Transport for London has functions conferred or imposed on it by the GLA Act which facilitate the implementation of the duties imposed on the Mayor and Greater London Authority under Section 141 of the GLA Act. London Buses, as a subsidiary of TfL, has powers under Section 169(2) of the GLA Act to enter into transport subsidiary agreements with any person for the provision of any public transport services. Agreement to operate any bus routes within Greater London must be in accordance with Section 182 (1) of the GLA Act. London Buses and TfL also have obligations under other more general Acts of Parliament, including the Transport Acts and the Disability Discrimination Act, and under European Union legislation.<br>3.3. The Mayor &amp; Greater London Authority<br>The Greater London Authority (GLA) is made up of the elected Mayor of London, the 25 elected London Assembly Members and a team of support staff. The Mayor draws up policies for Londonâ€Ÿs social, economic and environmental development in addition to transport.<br>The London Assembly examines the Mayorâ€Ÿs activities, scrutinising decisions and policies, approves the Mayorâ€Ÿs proposed budget before it is finalised and<br>Page 7<br>investigates issues of importance to Londoners. It then uses this information to make proposals and recommendations to the relevant organisations. The GLA is responsible for a range of services that affect all of London and those that need strategic London-wide planning. These include policing, fire services, economic development and transport. The Mayor sets their budgets and appoints the board members.<br>3.4. Transport for London<br>Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated body responsible for the Capital's transport system and is a functional body of the Greater London Authority. TfLâ€Ÿs primary roles are to implement the Mayor of London's Transport Strategy and to manage transport services across the Capital. TfL is responsible for: London's buses, the Underground, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Rail, Croydon Tramlink and London River Services The Public Carriage Office, Victoria Coach Station and London's Transport Museum The red route network, Congestion Charge, and London's 4,600 traffic lights Supporting a range of other ways of moving around the city, including cycling and walking<br>TfL is directed by a Board whose members are chosen for their understanding of transport matters and appointed by the Mayor of London, who chairs the Board. The policies are implemented by the Commissioner for Transport.<br>3.5. London Buses<br>London Bus Services Ltd (London Buses) is part of Surface Transport within TfL. London Buses implements relevant sections of the Mayorâ€Ÿs Transport Strategy, and delivers against passenger expectations. It is the organisation that plans bus routes, specifies service levels and monitors service quality. It is also responsible for bus stations and stops, and other services that support bus services on the road - around the clock. The bus services are generally operated by private operators, which work under contract to London Buses.<br>3.6. London TravelWatch<br>London TravelWatch (LTW) is the official watchdog organisation representing the interests of transport users in and around the capital. Officially known as London Transport Users Committee, it was established in July 2000.<br>LTW is independent of the transport operators and TfL, although it is sponsored and funded by the London Assembly, which is part of the Greater London Authority. It can assist with complaints about bus services in London where the service provider has not satisfactorily resolved them. London Buses is required by law to consult with LTW regarding proposed changes to bus services, however in practise London Buses consults LTW on a much wider range of issues.<br>Page 8<br>4. The History of London Bus Contracts and Tendering<br>4.1. The introduction of Competition<br>Up to 1985 London Transport operated nearly all bus services in London via its wholly owned subsidiary London Buses Limited (LBL). Whilst bus services in the rest of the UK were deregulated in the 1980s, regulation was retained in London but competition was introduced through tendering for individual routes as Gross Cost contracts. A separate unit called the Tendered Bus Division was set up within London Transport to manage the tendering process and initially the competition was between private companies and subsidiaries of LBL. The operators tendered on the basis of all the costs required to operate the specified service, including vehicle, staff and overhead costs, and London Transport retained the fares revenue. At this time, an unsatisfactorily large number of scheduled journeys simply did not operate - often due to lack of staff or serviceable vehicles. Under the new contracts operating companies were not paid for cancelled journeys within their responsibility (as detailed in Section 6.3). New standards for safety and reliability were also introduced, and contracts could also be terminated for poor performance. Three distinct types of contract have been tendered since 1985: Gross Cost Contracts, between 1985 and 2000; Net Cost Contracts, between 1995 and 1998; and Quality Incentive Contracts, from 2000 onwards<br>which are detailed further below.<br>4.2. Privatisation<br>In preparation for the proposals of the government of the time to privatise LBL, the company was divided up geographically into 13 subsidiary companies. The subsidiaries competed with private bus companies for tendered contracts. To allow for a controlled programme of tendering, until routes were tendered the subsidiary companies were funded by a „block grantâ€Ÿ agreement to cover the net cost of those services. To allow for privatisation, it was necessary to put in place formal contracts for each route. This meant that after privatisation the tendering programme could continue, allowing all routes to be subject to competition. Government policy at the time was to transfer risk to the private sector, so it was decided that these “block grant” agreements should be on a net cost basis. This shifted the revenue risk to the operators but it also gave them the incentive to generate more revenue by increasing the quality of the service provided. These net cost contracts were initially not subject to competition as the routes were allocated to each subsidiary and the terms of the contracts were agreed by negotiation. The length of these contracts varied, to give each company a reasonable forward order book, and to allow the network to be tendered over a reasonable timescale. This process is still represented by the current tendering programme.<br>Page 9<br>The process of transferring risk to the private sector continued from 1996 with the introduction of tendered Net Cost contracts, which whilst similar to the Gross Cost contracts (described in Section 4.1 above) transferred the revenue risk to the operator. Contracts were awarded under both Net Cost and Gross Cost terms to deliver the best value to London Transport. In 1994 the LBL subsidiaries were privatised, either through Management Buyouts or through sales to larger bus operators from outside London. The Tendered Bus Division was merged with other sections such as the LT Planning bus sections to form London Transport Buses. Following the creation of devolved government for London in 2000, under the Mayor and the Greater London Authority, London Transport Buses became London Bus Services Limited (London Buses), a part of Transport for London (TfL).<br>4.3. Present Contracts<br>In 2001, Quality Incentive Contracts were introduced to replace Gross Cost and Net Cost contracts as routes were tendered. These contracts are a development of previous contracts, but with direct financial incentives for operators linked to the quality of service. The contracts are an extension of the gross cost model insofar as TfL retains the revenue. By the late 1990s, the proportion of the scheduled mileage being operated had become more satisfactory. However reliability of all services – the regularity of buses on high frequency routes, and the adherence to the published timetable on low frequency routes - was still a cause for concern. Whilst each route already had a reliability benchmark called the Minimum Performance Standard (MPS), the older Net Cost and Gross Cost contracts had no financial incentive to achieve those targets. Further details of how Quality Incentive contracts work are given in Section 6.<br>4.4. Tendering and Contracts - Key Features<br>The key features of London Busesâ€Ÿ tendering and contracts system can be summarised as follows: Contracts are designed to provide incentives to operators to improve quality Routes are generally tendered individually, but often at the same time as other routes in the same area to facilitate service changes. Contracts are normally for 5 years, with a potential 2 year performance related extension available to the operator It is a continuing programme of tendering, with between 15% and 20% of the network typically tendered each year. Tender evaluation is based on best value for money, taking into account quality and safety as essential features Contract payments are related to the mileage operated and overall reliability of the service Comprehensive quality measurements are used across all aspects of delivery.<br>Page 10<br>5. The Tendering System In London<br>London Buses reviews every route prior to tender, and takes into account views from statutory consultees including London TravelWatch, London boroughs and other interested parties. This information is used to provide a service specification, which details: the route the buses will take (including the terminal arrangements), the frequency of the service at different times of the day &amp; the week (including the first and last bus times), the type and capacity of vehicles to be used the Minimum Performance Standard.<br>Operators are then asked to provide a schedule to deliver the level of service specified, and the total cost plus profit margin for providing the service to the specification.<br>5.1. European Procurement Directives<br>Bus service procurement activities are subject to the European Unionâ€Ÿs Procurement Directive 2004/17/EC of 31st March 2004 for utilities contracts. This directive has been implemented into UK law via the Utilities Contracts Regulations SI 2006 No. 2911. These regulations are principally concerned with ensuring that the procedures followed allow for fair competition within the EU. LBSL complies with the EU Directive and UK Procurement Regulations.<br>5.2. Approved Contractors<br>London Buses operates a pre-qualification system to maintain an approved supplier list and routinely publishes advertisements in the Official Journal of the European Union (www.ojeu.com) seeking expressions of interest. Once a potential operator has expressed an interest, we will make contact with them, discuss the situation and then issue a pre-qualification questionnaire. When a completed questionnaire is returned, a „desk-topâ€Ÿ evaluation is undertaken. This includes an assessment of areas such as the financial stability of the company, health and safety and previous experience in the transport or services sector. Where appropriate visits and meetings are arranged. If the initial assessment is acceptable, the organisation will be added to the approved supplier list for bus services. This does not necessarily mean that the organisation meets all of the requirements to be awarded a contract, but that it meets the basic conditions to be considered further. The organisation may then be able to submit a dummy bid, which will be assessed using standard evaluation principles and feedback given to assist future genuine submissions. The approved operator will be issued with a Bus Services Framework Agreement which includes full details of the contractual requirements, and a Master Invitation To Tender which includes a guide to submitting tenders. Award of any contract is conditional on the signing of the Framework Agreement.<br>Page 11<br>When approved, the operator will be notified of all bus service tendering opportunities, and asked to confirm if it wishes to be issued with the documentation for each tender on a route by route basis.<br>5.3. Tendering Programme<br>London Buses has a continuous programme of tendering with Invitations to Tender (ITT) being issued throughout the year. The rate of tendering is about 15% to 20% of Londonâ€Ÿs bus network each year (circa 90-120 routes, depending on the number of performance related extensions) with ITTs typically issued every 2-4 weeks. The annual tendering programme for each financial year is issued to all approved suppliers, and the latest version is available on the TfL website.<br>5.4. Types of Route Tendered<br>Services range from routes which require only one bus, through low frequency midibus routes up to high frequency 24-hour double deck routes. There are also dedicated school bus routes. Rail replacement services are secured on behalf of London Underground – you can find more information in Section 5.9 below. Route size varies significantly, with Peak Vehicle Requirements (PVR) ranging from 1 to over 50. Services are classed as either High Frequency (5 buses or more per hour throughout much of the week) or Low Frequency (4 buses per hour or less), and about 82% of the network is High Frequency. The highest frequency routes have a bus every 2-3 minutes, and the lowest frequency have a single return journey per day. Most routes operate from about 0430 until after midnight, but an increasing number of routes run 24 hours per day. Some additional „nightbusâ€Ÿ services only operate between about midnight and 04:30.<br>5.5. Types of Vehicle Utilised<br>Vehicles used on contracted services range from small midibuses through to 87 capacity double deck buses, depending on the specific requirements of each route. London Buses specifies the minimum requirements for the vehicles within the tender documentation. The operator may choose the vehicle manufacturer as long as the vehicles meet all of the criteria in the vehicle specification.<br>5.6. Service Specification<br>London Buses specifies the terminals, routeing, frequency and operating times of the route. It gives an indication of current running times and any significant problems identified with these running times. It also provides current performance &amp; minimum standards required by the new contract. Compliant tender submissions are evaluated against this specification.<br>5.7. Tender Information and Response<br>All tenders are submitted on a sealed bid basis with all the relevant information that is required by London Buses for the evaluation. Each submission must have a compliant bid, but operators may put forward alternatives that they believe would have benefits to passengers and/or<br>Page 12<br>London Buses. Alternatives may include options such as use of existing vehicles or variations to the service structure such as routeing or frequency.<br>5.8. Tender Evaluation<br>The overriding principle applied throughout the tendering process is one of fairness to all parties. Contracts are awarded with the intention of achieving the most economically advantageous outcome within the resources available to London Buses. The criteria used include (in no particular order, and are not limited to): Price Ability to deliver quality services - to at least the levels specified in the ITT Staffing – ability to recruit, train and retain staff of a suitable calibre Premises – status of depot, and/or ability to obtain a suitable depot Vehicles – type proposed and any additional features offered. This includes ability to maintain vehicles in an acceptable condition through the life of the contract Financial Status – the resources to fund the start up costs and provide stability over the contract term Schedules – compliance with the specifications Health and Safety Policy and records Sustaining competition for tendered routes<br>Tender evaluation is lead by the Contracts Tendering Manager and is carried out by a small team of skilled technical and commercial staff. Recommendations for contract awards are discussed and approved by the Tender Evaluation Committee, which is comprised of the directors of London Bus Services Ltd. During the evaluation, Contracts Tendering managers may contact bidders to clarify any areas of uncertainty and if considered necessary for commercial or technical reasons may enter into further negotiations with shortlisted tenderers. Unsuccessful tenderers are offered a debrief to explain why their bid was not successful.<br>5.9. Rail Replacement Bus Services<br>London Buses procures rail replacement services on behalf of London Underground. Planned services range in scope from one or two vehicle early morning and late evening journeys through to weekend closures requiring 50+ vehicles, and longer term arrangements during major upgrades of lines and stations. Over one hundred contracts are tendered in a typical year, most of which are for weekend closures so buses used on the main bus network during the week are generally used. The tendering process is similar to that used for network bus services. A separate Framework Agreement exists for rail replacement contracts, but they are tendered under the same legislative procedures as bus services. The prequalification procedure is similar to that described in Section 5.2.<br>Page 13<br>To ensure high standards, contracts for most rail replacement services are operated by companies that also operate London Busesâ€Ÿ main network contracts. Sub-contracting to operators that are not pre-qualified is not normally permitted. London Underground identifies the scope of the specific rail closure and a strategy for rail replacement is agreed with London Buses. Where a dedicated rail replacement service is required, a specification is produced and pre-qualified operators are invited to tender for one or more periods of closure. If the same closure occurs again within a year of the original tender, London Buses may invite the successful tenderer to operate the service again at the same cost. Emergency London Underground rail replacement services following major service disruption are also managed by London Buses. National Rail operators, London Overground and DLR make their own arrangements for replacement services.<br>Page 14<br>6. Quality Incentive Contracts<br>Quality Incentive Contracts were introduced in 2001 and have delivered significant improvements in service quality and passenger numbers. These contracts are based on gross cost contracts but also contain incentive provisions in the form of performance payment bonuses &amp; deductions and the option of a two year contract extension. The routes/contracts are tendered for an initial period of five years and when awarded contain a specific Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) which will generally be fixed for the life of the contract and which reflects the particular characteristics of the route. The contract price is adjusted each year in respect of inflation on the anniversary of the deadline date for tender submission. A formula which is designed to be representative of the actual movements in the cost base using a number of indices (e.g. labour rates, the Retail Price Index and fuel costs) is used to calculate these adjustments<br>6.1. Incentive Provisions<br>In addition to the requirement to operate the scheduled mileage three further incentive provisions exist within the Quality Incentive Contract. The original two provisions are performance payments based on the reliability of the service and contract extensions. From 2008, a second generation of performance payments has covered driving quality and is expected to be extended to cover vehicle condition from 2009.<br>6.1.1. Reliability Performance Payments<br>These are calculated on an annual basis by comparing the Operatorâ€Ÿs annual reliability performance on each route against the contracted MPS. Payments are based on a graduated scale with an increase or decrease in the payment for every whole 0.10 minute change in Excess Wait Time (EWT) for High Frequency routes and every whole 2.0 percentage point change in percentage On Time for Low Frequency routes. Bonus payments are paid at a rate of 1.5% of the contract price for each step above the standard. Deductions are made at a rate of 1% of the contract price for each step below the standard. Bonus and deduction payments are capped at 15% and 10% respectively of the contract price.<br>6.1.2. Contract Extensions<br>Under the terms of the contract an Operator is entitled to an automatic two year extension of the contract if it meets or exceeds the reliability “Extension Threshold” criteria set in the tender documentation for that route. This reliability threshold is slightly higher but related to the reliability MPS. Where a route qualifies for an extension, it is offered on the basis of the current contract provisions. The operator can choose to accept or reject the contract extension. If the operator declines to accept the extension, the route is tendered in the usual manner. If the extension is offered, the route is withdrawn from that yearâ€Ÿs tendering programme, and is tendered two years later.<br>Page 15<br>A small minority of routes are not operated under full incentive mechanisms (e.g. stand alone night routes, school services and other very low frequency services) because the resources required to monitor the reliability are out of proportion with the scale of the route. Furthermore some routes may operate under partial incentive provisions e.g. Performance Payments may be applicable but contract extensions may not be available for routes funded by some third parties. These are detailed in each ITT.<br>6.1.3. Quality Performance Payments<br>Building on the success of the earlier reliability incentive schemes, a second generation of payments based on driving quality (including customer service) and the presentation of vehicles (internally and externally) is being introduced. A combination of Mystery Traveller Surveys (whilst the bus is in service) and vehicle inspections (at terminals) throughout the day assess these aspects of service, and provides scores for each bus garage. These scores lead to payments or deductions against a network wide standard rewarding those companies which achieve higher levels of performance.<br>6.2. Minimum Performance Standards<br>The primary objective of bus operators is to safely operate all of the scheduled mileage and adhere fully to the level of service shown in the published timetable. London Buses sets specific MPS in respect of the quality of service to be provided. The measurement criteria for reliability used depend on whether the route is designated High or Low frequency, and are detailed further in Section 7.4. The specific reliability standard for each route depends on a set of consistently applied criteria, including the length and average journey time of the route, the type of areas it serves (such as congested town centres) and recovery time available at termini. The standards for driver quality and vehicle presentation are London wide.<br>6.3. Payment Adjustments for Service Reliability<br>Whilst operators are expected to operate the full contracted service this is not always possible for various unpredictable reasons, including mechanical breakdowns, staff sickness, roadworks, road closures and other incidents on or near buses. London Buses specifies an acceptable minimum performance standard for mileage operated for each route. Any mileage that is not operated can be split into two categories: “Deductible Lost Mileage” (mileage not operated but considered to be within the Operatorâ€Ÿs reasonable control i.e. staff absences, mechanical breakdown); and “Non Deductible Lost Mileage” (beyond the Operatorâ€Ÿs reasonable control i.e. adverse traffic conditions).<br>Operators are not paid for any mileage not operated under the category of “Deductible Lost Mileage”, and a deduction is made in proportion to the<br>Page 16<br>annual contract price and scheduled mileage. Deductions are not made for “Non Deductible Lost Mileage”, although poor performance in this area is kept under review.<br>6.4. Contract Payments and Revenue<br>London Buses operates on the basis of 4 week accounting periods, with 13 periods each year running from April to March. Contract payments are made by BACS. 75% of the contract price is paid during the relevant period. The balance, less deductions for Deductible Lost Mileage, is paid at the end of the following period. Payments (and deductions) under the reliability incentive scheme are made annually, and for the more recently introduced driving and vehicle quality incentive schemes quarterly.<br>6.5. Summary of Responsibilities<br>The contractual and tendering system places responsibilities on both London Buses and operators. London Buses, or its third party contractors: Determines and runs the tendering programme Determines the route Specifies the frequency Sets and monitors quality and safety standards Sets vehicle capacities and minimum standards Agrees the schedule prepared by the operator Sets fares and retains the revenue Supplies and maintains ticket machines Provides revenue protection (on-bus revenue protection inspectors) Supplies and maintains radio and vehicle tracking equipment Provides and maintains bus network infrastructure (bus stops, stands and bus stations) Provides an emergency communication facility (CentreComm) 24 hours a day Provides roadside staff to deal with diversions and major incidents 24 hours a day Markets the bus services to the public Manages liaison with local authorities and other stakeholders Coordinates public customer service contacts – complaints, comments and compliments Invests in major network and infrastructure projects.<br>The Operators: Develop and submit bids Develop timetables, schedules and staff rotas – timetables must be agreed with London Buses Provide and maintain premises and vehicles Recruit, train and mange sufficient staff of a suitable calibre Manage the day to day operation of routes<br>Page 17<br>Provide day to day supervision of routes, to maintain quality and deal with disruption Control the use of passes and collect any cash revenue on buses Comply with UK statutory and regulatory regimes, including Operating Licenses Provide data that is reasonably required by London Buses.<br>Page 18<br>7. Measuring Quality of Performance<br>7.1. Targets<br>The Mayor and the TfL Board set performance targets for London Buses within TfLâ€Ÿs Business Plan.<br>7.2. Monitoring Systems<br>Londonâ€Ÿs Buses have seen a considerable increase in quality standards since 1990, and continually seeks to maintain year on year improvements to the service provided to passengers. To do this, there are a number of performance monitoring systems in operation, in addition to any other system operators may use for their own management processes. The data obtained by London Buses is normally shared with the appropriate operator, and network level data is also published for many measures, and is normally available on TfLâ€Ÿs website. London Buses tries to avoid duplicating the monitoring systems of other UK organisations. The current measurements and monitoring are as follows:<br>7.3. Mileage Operated (excluding traffic and other non deductible losses)<br>This measure is used as an incentive by London Buses, as deductions from contract payments are made for mileage that is lost for reasons that are reasonably within the control of the operator. These include non availability of staff and vehicles not being mechanically fit to be used on the road. This has shown a vast improvement over the last 10-15 years.<br>7.4. Reliability<br>This forms part of the assessment of an operatorâ€Ÿs ability to schedule, control and adjust services. It also forms the basis of financial bonuses and deductions on incentivised contracts. The roadside surveys to collect this data cover approximately 3-5% of the service, although it is anticipated that vehicle tracking technology will gradually replace the current human observations. The measurements are different for high and low frequency routes:<br>7.4.1. Regularity on High Frequency services<br>On services that are defined as High Frequency – five or more buses per hour throughout most of the week – London Buses measures the interval between buses and compares it to the advertised frequency. The aim is to ensure that the buses are evenly spaced, and that on average a passenger should not have to wait for longer than half of the advertised frequency. On High Frequency routes, it is considered that passengers can “turn up and go” as the waiting time should be relatively short and the timetable is less important. The measure is expressed as “Excess Wait Time” (EWT), which is defined as the extra time that passengers have had to wait above the expected waiting period. The objective is to reduce EWT to zero.<br>Page 19<br>Additionally, „long gapsâ€Ÿ in service are measured, which tend to indicate more fundamental problems such as cancelled buses, curtailments and poor service control leading to „bunchingâ€Ÿ.<br>7.4.2. Punctuality on Low Frequency services<br>On Low Frequency routes - four buses per hour or less throughout most of the week – London Buses measures how close the departure time from the stop is to the advertised timetable. On these routes, the timetable is more important as passengers are more likely to rely on the published departure time when planning their journey. The measure is expressed as a percentage of departures that are “On Time”. On Time is a window from 2½ minutes earlier than expected to five minutes later than expected. The objective is to increase “On Time” departures to 100%. Additionally the percentage of journeys running “Early” is also monitored, where early is defined as a bus departing between 2½ and eight minutes ahead of the schedule. It is normally considered that there is little excuse for early running, as passengers may not have arrived at the stop.<br>7.5. Driver and Vehicle Quality Monitoring<br>The Driver and Vehicle Quality Monitoring Programme provides robust and actionable data on which to base financial incentives to bus operating companies to improve performance (as detailed in Section 6.1.3 above). The programme builds on earlier Mystery Traveller Surveys and objectively monitors service quality and compliance with contractual requirements utilising auditing and „mystery shoppingâ€Ÿ survey techniques to measure pre-defined, key aspects of service delivery. The research is conducted on London Busesâ€Ÿ behalf by a leading market research agency, and comprises two compatible surveys: Static audit of buses in service assessed at bus stands to evaluate „fixedâ€Ÿ aspects of service delivery (e.g. etching, graffiti, structural damage and in-grained dirt). Around 17,000 surveys are carried out per annum. Mystery shopping surveys whilst the vehicle is in service to assess vehicle handling, customer interaction and aspects of the vehicle affected by buses being in service. Around 33,000 surveys per annum are carried out.<br>The data is collated and following a quality assurance process is shared with the operators so that they can take action to address any areas of weakness that are identified. The results are used by London Buses to generate the payments (or deductions) under the driving and vehicle quality incentive regime.<br>Page 20<br>7.6. Driver Quality Monitoring<br>This is a separate independent survey carried out by London Busesâ€Ÿ specialist contractor which covertly undertakes over 6,500 assessments each year across the London Bus network to assess driving skills. It differs from the assessments detailed in Section 7.5 by focussing as much on the technical ability of the driver – such as use of mirrors and lane discipline - as it does on passenger consideration. For each assessment, a driver receives a graded score for a series of measures such as speed, road position and braking and there are over twenty categories per assessment. This level of monitoring is rare, in that most employers of professional drivers undertake no such monitoring of their staff, and manage their professional drivers solely on the basis of claims or accidents. A combination of initiatives has led to a steady improvement in the scores in the recent past.<br>7.7. Engineering Quality Monitoring<br>London Busesâ€Ÿ independent contractor undertakes regular checks on the maintenance procedures and mechanical condition of the vehicles used on its contracts. This is undertaken by a thorough examination of about 25% of each operatorâ€Ÿs fleet throughout the year, similar to an „MOTâ€Ÿ test for cars. The examinations are conducted by trained staff working to the same criteria. Any defects are noted and given a score, with higher scores for more serious defects. The key measure is the average number of points per vehicles, with a target of zero. The monitoring also includes the maintenance procedures, and the operatorsâ€Ÿ vehicle pass rate at annual test.<br>7.8. Customer Satisfaction<br>There are three London Buses Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS), focusing on Bus Services, Night Buses and Bus Stations which have been undertaken since 1997. These enable London Buses and bus operators to monitor customersâ€Ÿ satisfaction with the quality of services provided and identify areas for improvement. Face-to-face interviews are conducted with passengers alighting from buses. Questions relate to the journey that has just been made including overall satisfaction with journey just made, information, safety and security, cleanliness, reliability and staff behaviour.<br>7.9. Public Correspondence Data<br>London Buses collates all public communications made by phone, email or letter. This data is analysed at route level on themes including driving standards. This helps London Buses to understand and address specific concerns.<br>7.10. Contract Compliance Audits<br>To ensure that operators comply with the specifications in the contract, London Busesâ€Ÿ Contract Compliance team make regular visits to all operating garages. These audits help to ensure that: there are sufficiently rigorous administration systems in place to handle and account for on-bus revenue and London Buses owned or managed equipment. They also ensure that lost<br>Page 21<br>mileage is reported correctly so that the correct contract payments are claimed; and that drivers comply with working time and driving time legislation.<br>7.11. Other Sanctions and Remedies<br>Operatorsâ€Ÿ performance is regularly reviewed by senior London Buses staff. They examine a range of indicators, including mileage operated, reliability, driving and engineering standards as well as the measures detailed above. Unsatisfactory performance is discussed with individual operators, and if necessary operators may be required to produce and implement action plans to resolve performance issues. Current and past performance is taken into account in the evaluation of tenders and recommendation for award of new contracts. London Buses usually resolves any performance issues through normal contract management. However if performance continues to be poor and it is considered that it cannot be resolved by other means, as an ultimate sanction London Buses retains the right to terminate any contract.<br>7.12. Safety<br>A range of data is used by London Buses as part of the assessment of an operatorâ€Ÿs ability to provide a safe service and failure can result in the loss of a contract. Unsatisfactory performance can also lead to the failure to win new contracts. The incentive is not directly related to payments/deductions due to the importance of avoiding the suggestion that safety of operation is in any way a negotiable trade off against cost. Safety is not generally measured against „front lineâ€Ÿ passenger experience, but from an insight into an operatorâ€Ÿs standards. Much of the work is based on visits to operating premises and interviews with operational staff. These include checks on policies, procedures and risk assessments. These visits are followed by a report highlighting areas of concern and an action plan. This plan is then reviewed and forms the basis of the next inspection. In addition to Driver and Engineering Quality Monitoring, as described above, operators provide data regarding all accidents and incidents which occur whilst a bus is in service. This information is collated and analysed by London Buses.<br>7.13. Passenger &amp; Staff security<br>The entire London Bus fleet is fitted with CCTV and recording equipment. This is used to identify individuals who commit offences, against both other passengers and the vehicle. It can also be used to assist in the investigation of injury and insurance claims.<br>London Buses operates a central communications facility, CentreComm, and each bus is fitted with a two-way radio system which allows drivers to issue an<br>Page 22<br>emergency call if they require assistance. The radio system is otherwise used to communicate information about disruptions to service. TfL funds the Transport Operational Command Unit, a dedicated team including staff from the Metropolitan Police which is in place to deal with surface transport related policing issues, which includes enforcement of bus lanes, supporting revenue protection operations and investigating and prosecuting fare evaders.<br>Page 23<br>8. Environment<br>8.1. London Buses and the environment<br>Environmental issues are of increasing concern in London, with much of the debate focused on transport. TfL is committed to minimising harm to the environment. The provision of a comprehensive, safe and efficient public transport network in Greater London (including the bus network) is an important element. TfL complies with the relevant environmental legislation, and follows the Mayorâ€Ÿs Air Quality Strategy, which specifies key objectives for Londonâ€Ÿs bus fleet.<br>8.2. Lowering emissions<br>Tenders for bus services specify that new vehicles should be to the latest legal European emissions standards, and operators are encouraged to introduce higher standards sooner than required. Buses on the London Bus network have a minimum standard of Euro 2, and are fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters which reduce the levels of fine particles, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons in exhaust gases by over 90%. It is also recognised that driving techniques can reduce emissions, and this is included within the BTEC training for bus drivers (see Section 9.3). London Buses is also trialling the latest advances in vehicle technology, including hydrogen fuel cell buses which have no polluting emissions on the road. Diesel-electric hybrid buses (which are powered by batteries that are charged by regenerative braking and smaller engines, which produce lower emissions than a full size diesel engine) are being trialled more widely, and if successful will be phased in across the bus network from 2012.<br>Page 24<br>9. Current and Future Initiatives<br>9.1. Smartcards and Cashless Buses<br>Oyster is TfLâ€Ÿs travel smartcard. Passengers can put their period “Travelcard” or “Bus Pass” season ticket on it, add electronic travel value to pay as you go, or have a combination of both. Oyster cards are also reusable. This means that when the season ticket expires it can be replaced on the same Oyster card, and when electronic travel value runs out, it can just be topped up. London Buses is attempting to reduce the number of cash transactions on buses, to speed up boarding and improve security and driversâ€Ÿ safety. A number of busy routes and areas already have cashless boarding – passengers need to have a season ticket, an Oyster card or to purchase a ticket from the roadside ticket machine before they board the bus.<br>9.2. Bus Priority<br>The bus priority team develop and deliver highway and traffic management schemes to improve journey times and service reliability for bus passengers. These schemes include bus lanes, junction improvements and traffic signal priority. This involves working with other parts of TfL Surface Transport and the London boroughs. Some schemes are individual local projects to deal with a specific local problem. In other cases schemes for entire bus routes or network corridors are introduced. These measures improve bus reliability, protect bus passengers from excess delays and facilitate improvements capacity of bus services.<br>9.3. Bus Driver and Service Controller Training<br>Raising training standards and achieving greater consistency in the training of front line bus operating staff is a key objective for London Buses. To help achieve these aims, London Buses commissioned two bespoke BTEC qualifications in consultation with bus operators, training providers and trades unions. The two qualifications (one aimed at drivers, the other aimed at service controllers) were developed in conjunction with Edexcel, the examinations award body. Both qualifications have been designed so that the staff taking them are able to demonstrate their ability to do their job competently and to a consistent standard across the London bus network. The degree of assessment required and paperwork associated with the qualifications has been kept to the minimum, but it still allows staff to show what they are capable of and what they understand about the industry they work in. Responsibility for delivering the training rests with the individual bus operators. At the end of the training, provided the candidate has successfully met all of the assessment requirements, they will achieve their BTEC qualification.<br>Page 25<br>9.4. iBUS<br>iBus is the latest radio and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system for buses. It ensures that the service controllers at garages know the exact location of all buses fitted with the system at all times. Using a combination of technologies, including satellite tracking and GPRS data transfer, iBus keeps track of where Londonâ€Ÿs buses are, allowing bus controllers to regulate services to make them more reliable. Thanks to on board „next stopâ€Ÿ audio-visual announcements, passengers know where their bus is, even if theyâ€Ÿre on an unfamiliar route. They will also benefit from more reliable real-time information on Countdown signs at bus stops. CentreComm – London Busesâ€Ÿ 24/7 Emergency Command and Control Centre – will be able to use the on-bus PA system to communicate directly with passengers in the event of an emergency. Another benefit to passengers is that in case of the driver making emergency radio contact following an accident or emergency, CentreComm will immediately be able to pinpoint the precise location of a specific bus, so any necessary assistance can be despatched immediately.<br>9.5. Countdown<br>Countdown is the name of the real-time display information at 2000 selected bus stops that predict the arrival time for buses. As the iBus project unlocks the full potential of Countdown, displays will be replaced and additional displays installed at more stops across the network.<br>Page 26<br>10.

              1. Introduction<br>
              Londonâ€Ÿs bus network is unique in the mainland United Kingdom in
              that it is regulated. This enables Transport for London to plan,
              procure and manage a network of services in a consistent and
              co-ordinated manner. This system, along with adequate funding and
              collaborative working with other organisations has lead to
              increased service levels, improved quality of services and
              significant increases in patronage. Bus operators compete for
              contracts to provide specified services for up to seven years, and
              are rewarded for exceeding defined targets to improve the service
              to our passengers. Their role is crucial to the current and future
              success of bus transport in London. The tendering and contracting
              arrangements are designed to deliver value for money, balancing the
              expectations of our passengers against the costs of improvements. A
              London Assembly Transport Committee scrutiny of bus contracts in
              March 2006 recognised that the London bus network represents value
              for money. Transport for London is committed to promoting fair and
              sustained competition to provide bus services in market that is
              dynamic and unique. This document explains our bus service
              tendering and contracting process and we look forward to further
              developing and building on its already proven success.<br>

              2. The Market in London â€“ overview<br>
              London Bus Services Limited (London Buses) is part of Transport for
              London (TfL) which is one of the organisations responsible for
              delivering the Mayor of Londonâ€Ÿs Transport Strategies. London Buses
              manages bus services in London. It plans routes, specifies service
              levels and ensures service quality. It is also responsible for bus
              stations, bus stops and other support services. The bus services
              are operated by privately owned operating companies, which work
              under contract to London Buses. Every weekday over 7,000 scheduled
              buses carry over six million passengers on approximately 700
              different routes. Over 100 of those routes run 24 hours a day,
              seven days a week. The network is dynamic and responds to London's
              growth and changing transport needs. Every year up to a fifth of
              the total bus service is re-tendered, with around half of the
              network subject to some level of review. Buses are widely
              recognised as the best option for increasing public transport
              capacity in the short-term. Many initiatives are in place to make
              journeys as easy, reliable, quick, convenient, comfortable and
              affordable as possible. The following figures demonstrate how much
              the bus network has developed in the last few years: Bus ridership
              has grown by 68% per cent between 1999/2000 and 2007/08 Buses in
              London now carry the highest number of passengers since 1962 In the
              year to March 2008, there were 2.18 billion passenger trips on the
              network Bus kilometers in London is higher than at any time since
              1957, with 468 million km operated in 2007/8<br>

              3. Purpose and Structure of key organisations in Londonâ€™s bus
              tendering process<br>
              3.1. Historical and Political Situation<br>
              When London's urban public transport was brought together in 1933
              with the support of the London Passenger Transport Board, bus
              services covered a vast area. At the time, they served much of what
              is now Greater London, as well as areas in many of the adjacent
              counties, up to around 35 miles distance from Central London. From
              1970 to 1984, London Transport (LT) came under the direct control
              of the Greater London Council (GLC) and the area for which LT was
              legally responsible was also reduced to the present 1,580 sq km
              (610 sq miles). Cross boundary links were retained and the GLC and
              county councils took decisions on the funding of those services.
              Under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, LT was again brought
              under central government control. The Act required LT to set up
              subsidiary companies to run both buses and the Underground. It also
              stipulated that, where appropriate, competitive tendering should be
              introduced to ensure LT operated economically and required less
              financial assistance from public funds. In 1986, bus services
              outside London were deregulated. This meant that any licensed
              operator could decide to run a new route even if another company
              already ran a service along the same roads. Although London was
              exempted, it was intended that once bus services in the capital had
              become less dependent on government assistance and steps had been
              taken to encourage greater competition between operators,
              deregulation would be extended to include London. In 1985, LT set
              up a subsidiary known as London Buses Limited (LBL) to run its bus
              services. However, route planning and fare structures remained the
              responsibility of LT. In the same year, LT set up the Tendered Bus
              Division to begin the process of competitive tendering. This
              required LBL to compete against privately owned operators for the
              opportunity to run individual bus routes on behalf of LT. The
              routes were awarded to the operator which could run the best
              service at the most cost-effective price, and about 40% of the
              initial contracts were awarded to private companies rather than
              LBL. It also led to another change as buses began appearing on
              London's streets in liveries that were not traditional LT red. As a
              step towards the planned deregulation of services, LBL created 13
              locally based subsidiary companies, each with its own commercial
              remit.<br>
              Page 6<br>
              These companies conducted their own wage negotiations, took
              appropriate steps to reduce their overheads and competed against
              each other, as well as private companies, for the contracts to run
              LT bus routes. The subsidiaries became increasingly successful in
              competing for routes. In December 1992, the government announced
              that the LBL operating companies would be sold into the private
              sector ahead of deregulation. However, a year later, it decided to
              postpone deregulation until after the General Election in May 1997,
              although the sale of the operating companies to the private sector
              was completed in 1994. The Labour government, elected in 1997, was
              committed to reintroducing a strategic governing authority for
              London. In July 2000, London Transport was replaced by a new
              organisation called Transport for London (TfL).<br>
              3.2. Legal and Statutory Framework<br>
              Transport for London and London Bus Services Ltd (London Buses) are
              required to comply with a number of UK and European statutes and
              regulations. Some of the key obligations for the provision of bus
              services are detailed in this section. The Mayor and the Greater
              London Authority have a duty to develop and implement policies for
              the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and
              economic transport facilities to, from and within Greater London
              under Section 141 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (GLA
              Act). Transport for London has functions conferred or imposed on it
              by the GLA Act which facilitate the implementation of the duties
              imposed on the Mayor and Greater London Authority under Section 141
              of the GLA Act. London Buses, as a subsidiary of TfL, has powers
              under Section 169(2) of the GLA Act to enter into transport
              subsidiary agreements with any person for the provision of any
              public transport services. Agreement to operate any bus routes
              within Greater London must be in accordance with Section 182 (1) of
              the GLA Act. London Buses and TfL also have obligations under other
              more general Acts of Parliament, including the Transport Acts and
              the Disability Discrimination Act, and under European Union
              legislation.<br>
              3.3. The Mayor &amp; Greater London Authority<br>
              The Greater London Authority (GLA) is made up of the elected Mayor
              of London, the 25 elected London Assembly Members and a team of
              support staff. The Mayor draws up policies for Londonâ€Ÿs social,
              economic and environmental development in addition to
              transport.<br>
              The London Assembly examines the Mayorâ€Ÿs activities, scrutinising
              decisions and policies, approves the Mayorâ€Ÿs proposed budget before
              it is finalised and<br>
              Page 7<br>
              investigates issues of importance to Londoners. It then uses this
              information to make proposals and recommendations to the relevant
              organisations. The GLA is responsible for a range of services that
              affect all of London and those that need strategic London-wide
              planning. These include policing, fire services, economic
              development and transport. The Mayor sets their budgets and
              appoints the board members.<br>
              3.4. Transport for London<br>
              Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as the integrated
              body responsible for the Capital's transport system and is a
              functional body of the Greater London Authority. TfLâ€Ÿs primary
              roles are to implement the Mayor of London's Transport Strategy and
              to manage transport services across the Capital. TfL is responsible
              for: London's buses, the Underground, the Docklands Light Railway
              (DLR), London Rail, Croydon Tramlink and London River Services The
              Public Carriage Office, Victoria Coach Station and London's
              Transport Museum The red route network, Congestion Charge, and
              London's 4,600 traffic lights Supporting a range of other ways of
              moving around the city, including cycling and walking<br>
              TfL is directed by a Board whose members are chosen for their
              understanding of transport matters and appointed by the Mayor of
              London, who chairs the Board. The policies are implemented by the
              Commissioner for Transport.<br>
              3.5. London Buses<br>
              London Bus Services Ltd (London Buses) is part of Surface Transport
              within TfL. London Buses implements relevant sections of the
              Mayorâ€Ÿs Transport Strategy, and delivers against passenger
              expectations. It is the organisation that plans bus routes,
              specifies service levels and monitors service quality. It is also
              responsible for bus stations and stops, and other services that
              support bus services on the road - around the clock. The bus
              services are generally operated by private operators, which work
              under contract to London Buses.<br>
              3.6. London TravelWatch<br>
              London TravelWatch (LTW) is the official watchdog organisation
              representing the interests of transport users in and around the
              capital. Officially known as London Transport Users Committee, it
              was established in July 2000.<br>
              LTW is independent of the transport operators and TfL, although it
              is sponsored and funded by the London Assembly, which is part of
              the Greater London Authority. It can assist with complaints about
              bus services in London where the service provider has not
              satisfactorily resolved them. London Buses is required by law to
              consult with LTW regarding proposed changes to bus services,
              however in practise London Buses consults LTW on a much wider range
              of issues.<br>
              Page 8<br>
              4. The History of London Bus Contracts and Tendering<br>
              4.1. The introduction of Competition<br>
              Up to 1985 London Transport operated nearly all bus services in
              London via its wholly owned subsidiary London Buses Limited (LBL).
              Whilst bus services in the rest of the UK were deregulated in the
              1980s, regulation was retained in London but competition was
              introduced through tendering for individual routes as Gross Cost
              contracts. A separate unit called the Tendered Bus Division was set
              up within London Transport to manage the tendering process and
              initially the competition was between private companies and
              subsidiaries of LBL. The operators tendered on the basis of all the
              costs required to operate the specified service, including vehicle,
              staff and overhead costs, and London Transport retained the fares
              revenue. At this time, an unsatisfactorily large number of
              scheduled journeys simply did not operate - often due to lack of
              staff or serviceable vehicles. Under the new contracts operating
              companies were not paid for cancelled journeys within their
              responsibility (as detailed in Section 6.3). New standards for
              safety and reliability were also introduced, and contracts could
              also be terminated for poor performance. Three distinct types of
              contract have been tendered since 1985: Gross Cost Contracts,
              between 1985 and 2000; Net Cost Contracts, between 1995 and 1998;
              and Quality Incentive Contracts, from 2000 onwards<br>
              which are detailed further below.<br>
              4.2. Privatisation<br>
              In preparation for the proposals of the government of the time to
              privatise LBL, the company was divided up geographically into 13
              subsidiary companies. The subsidiaries competed with private bus
              companies for tendered contracts. To allow for a controlled
              programme of tendering, until routes were tendered the subsidiary
              companies were funded by a â€žblock grantâ€Ÿ agreement to cover the net
              cost of those services. To allow for privatisation, it was
              necessary to put in place formal contracts for each route. This
              meant that after privatisation the tendering programme could
              continue, allowing all routes to be subject to competition.
              Government policy at the time was to transfer risk to the private
              sector, so it was decided that these â€œblock grantâ€� agreements
              should be on a net cost basis. This shifted the revenue risk to the
              operators but it also gave them the incentive to generate more
              revenue by increasing the quality of the service provided. These
              net cost contracts were initially not subject to competition as the
              routes were allocated to each subsidiary and the terms of the
              contracts were agreed by negotiation. The length of these contracts
              varied, to give each company a reasonable forward order book, and
              to allow the network to be tendered over a reasonable timescale.
              This process is still represented by the current tendering
              programme.<br>
              Page 9<br>
              The process of transferring risk to the private sector continued
              from 1996 with the introduction of tendered Net Cost contracts,
              which whilst similar to the Gross Cost contracts (described in
              Section 4.1 above) transferred the revenue risk to the operator.
              Contracts were awarded under both Net Cost and Gross Cost terms to
              deliver the best value to London Transport. In 1994 the LBL
              subsidiaries were privatised, either through Management Buyouts or
              through sales to larger bus operators from outside London. The
              Tendered Bus Division was merged with other sections such as the LT
              Planning bus sections to form London Transport Buses. Following the
              creation of devolved government for London in 2000, under the Mayor
              and the Greater London Authority, London Transport Buses became
              London Bus Services Limited (London Buses), a part of Transport for
              London (TfL).<br>
              4.3. Present Contracts<br>
              In 2001, Quality Incentive Contracts were introduced to replace
              Gross Cost and Net Cost contracts as routes were tendered. These
              contracts are a development of previous contracts, but with direct
              financial incentives for operators linked to the quality of
              service. The contracts are an extension of the gross cost model
              insofar as TfL retains the revenue. By the late 1990s, the
              proportion of the scheduled mileage being operated had become more
              satisfactory. However reliability of all services â€“ the regularity
              of buses on high frequency routes, and the adherence to the
              published timetable on low frequency routes - was still a cause for
              concern. Whilst each route already had a reliability benchmark
              called the Minimum Performance Standard (MPS), the older Net Cost
              and Gross Cost contracts had no financial incentive to achieve
              those targets. Further details of how Quality Incentive contracts
              work are given in Section 6.<br>
              4.4. Tendering and Contracts - Key Features<br>
              The key features of London Busesâ€Ÿ tendering and contracts system
              can be summarised as follows: Contracts are designed to provide
              incentives to operators to improve quality Routes are generally
              tendered individually, but often at the same time as other routes
              in the same area to facilitate service changes. Contracts are
              normally for 5 years, with a potential 2 year performance related
              extension available to the operator It is a continuing programme of
              tendering, with between 15% and 20% of the network typically
              tendered each year. Tender evaluation is based on best value for
              money, taking into account quality and safety as essential features
              Contract payments are related to the mileage operated and overall
              reliability of the service Comprehensive quality measurements are
              used across all aspects of delivery.<br>
              Page 10<br>
              5. The Tendering System In London<br>
              London Buses reviews every route prior to tender, and takes into
              account views from statutory consultees including London
              TravelWatch, London boroughs and other interested parties. This
              information is used to provide a service specification, which
              details: the route the buses will take (including the terminal
              arrangements), the frequency of the service at different times of
              the day &amp; the week (including the first and last bus times),
              the type and capacity of vehicles to be used the Minimum
              Performance Standard.<br>
              Operators are then asked to provide a schedule to deliver the level
              of service specified, and the total cost plus profit margin for
              providing the service to the specification.<br>
              5.1. European Procurement Directives<br>
              Bus service procurement activities are subject to the European
              Unionâ€Ÿs Procurement Directive 2004/17/EC of 31st March 2004 for
              utilities contracts. This directive has been implemented into UK
              law via the Utilities Contracts Regulations SI 2006 No. 2911. These
              regulations are principally concerned with ensuring that the
              procedures followed allow for fair competition within the EU. LBSL
              complies with the EU Directive and UK Procurement
              Regulations.<br>
              5.2. Approved Contractors<br>
              London Buses operates a pre-qualification system to maintain an
              approved supplier list and routinely publishes advertisements in
              the Official Journal of the European Union (www.ojeu.com) seeking
              expressions of interest. Once a potential operator has expressed an
              interest, we will make contact with them, discuss the situation and
              then issue a pre-qualification questionnaire. When a completed
              questionnaire is returned, a â€ždesk-topâ€Ÿ evaluation is undertaken.
              This includes an assessment of areas such as the financial
              stability of the company, health and safety and previous experience
              in the transport or services sector. Where appropriate visits and
              meetings are arranged. If the initial assessment is acceptable, the
              organisation will be added to the approved supplier list for bus
              services. This does not necessarily mean that the organisation
              meets all of the requirements to be awarded a contract, but that it
              meets the basic conditions to be considered further. The
              organisation may then be able to submit a dummy bid, which will be
              assessed using standard evaluation principles and feedback given to
              assist future genuine submissions. The approved operator will be
              issued with a Bus Services Framework Agreement which includes full
              details of the contractual requirements, and a Master Invitation To
              Tender which includes a guide to submitting tenders. Award of any
              contract is conditional on the signing of the Framework
              Agreement.<br>
              Page 11<br>
              When approved, the operator will be notified of all bus service
              tendering opportunities, and asked to confirm if it wishes to be
              issued with the documentation for each tender on a route by route
              basis.<br>
              5.3. Tendering Programme<br>
              London Buses has a continuous programme of tendering with
              Invitations to Tender (ITT) being issued throughout the year. The
              rate of tendering is about 15% to 20% of Londonâ€Ÿs bus network each
              year (circa 90-120 routes, depending on the number of performance
              related extensions) with ITTs typically issued every 2-4 weeks. The
              annual tendering programme for each financial year is issued to all
              approved suppliers, and the latest version is available on the TfL
              website.<br>
              5.4. Types of Route Tendered<br>
              Services range from routes which require only one bus, through low
              frequency midibus routes up to high frequency 24-hour double deck
              routes. There are also dedicated school bus routes. Rail
              replacement services are secured on behalf of London Underground â€“
              you can find more information in Section 5.9 below. Route size
              varies significantly, with Peak Vehicle Requirements (PVR) ranging
              from 1 to over 50. Services are classed as either High Frequency (5
              buses or more per hour throughout much of the week) or Low
              Frequency (4 buses per hour or less), and about 82% of the network
              is High Frequency. The highest frequency routes have a bus every
              2-3 minutes, and the lowest frequency have a single return journey
              per day. Most routes operate from about 0430 until after midnight,
              but an increasing number of routes run 24 hours per day. Some
              additional â€žnightbusâ€Ÿ services only operate between about midnight
              and 04:30.<br>
              5.5. Types of Vehicle Utilised<br>
              Vehicles used on contracted services range from small midibuses
              through to 87 capacity double deck buses, depending on the specific
              requirements of each route. London Buses specifies the minimum
              requirements for the vehicles within the tender documentation. The
              operator may choose the vehicle manufacturer as long as the
              vehicles meet all of the criteria in the vehicle
              specification.<br>
              5.6. Service Specification<br>
              London Buses specifies the terminals, routeing, frequency and
              operating times of the route. It gives an indication of current
              running times and any significant problems identified with these
              running times. It also provides current performance &amp; minimum
              standards required by the new contract. Compliant tender
              submissions are evaluated against this specification.<br>
              5.7. Tender Information and Response<br>
              All tenders are submitted on a sealed bid basis with all the
              relevant information that is required by London Buses for the
              evaluation. Each submission must have a compliant bid, but
              operators may put forward alternatives that they believe would have
              benefits to passengers and/or<br>
              Page 12<br>
              London Buses. Alternatives may include options such as use of
              existing vehicles or variations to the service structure such as
              routeing or frequency.<br>
              5.8. Tender Evaluation<br>
              The overriding principle applied throughout the tendering process
              is one of fairness to all parties. Contracts are awarded with the
              intention of achieving the most economically advantageous outcome
              within the resources available to London Buses. The criteria used
              include (in no particular order, and are not limited to): Price
              Ability to deliver quality services - to at least the levels
              specified in the ITT Staffing â€“ ability to recruit, train and
              retain staff of a suitable calibre Premises â€“ status of depot,
              and/or ability to obtain a suitable depot Vehicles â€“ type proposed
              and any additional features offered. This includes ability to
              maintain vehicles in an acceptable condition through the life of
              the contract Financial Status â€“ the resources to fund the start up
              costs and provide stability over the contract term Schedules â€“
              compliance with the specifications Health and Safety Policy and
              records Sustaining competition for tendered routes<br>
              Tender evaluation is lead by the Contracts Tendering Manager and is
              carried out by a small team of skilled technical and commercial
              staff. Recommendations for contract awards are discussed and
              approved by the Tender Evaluation Committee, which is comprised of
              the directors of London Bus Services Ltd. During the evaluation,
              Contracts Tendering managers may contact bidders to clarify any
              areas of uncertainty and if considered necessary for commercial or
              technical reasons may enter into further negotiations with
              shortlisted tenderers. Unsuccessful tenderers are offered a debrief
              to explain why their bid was not successful.<br>
              5.9. Rail Replacement Bus Services<br>
              London Buses procures rail replacement services on behalf of London
              Underground. Planned services range in scope from one or two
              vehicle early morning and late evening journeys through to weekend
              closures requiring 50+ vehicles, and longer term arrangements
              during major upgrades of lines and stations. Over one hundred
              contracts are tendered in a typical year, most of which are for
              weekend closures so buses used on the main bus network during the
              week are generally used. The tendering process is similar to that
              used for network bus services. A separate Framework Agreement
              exists for rail replacement contracts, but they are tendered under
              the same legislative procedures as bus services. The
              prequalification procedure is similar to that described in Section
              5.2.<br>
              Page 13<br>
              To ensure high standards, contracts for most rail replacement
              services are operated by companies that also operate London Busesâ€Ÿ
              main network contracts. Sub-contracting to operators that are not
              pre-qualified is not normally permitted. London Underground
              identifies the scope of the specific rail closure and a strategy
              for rail replacement is agreed with London Buses. Where a dedicated
              rail replacement service is required, a specification is produced
              and pre-qualified operators are invited to tender for one or more
              periods of closure. If the same closure occurs again within a year
              of the original tender, London Buses may invite the successful
              tenderer to operate the service again at the same cost. Emergency
              London Underground rail replacement services following major
              service disruption are also managed by London Buses. National Rail
              operators, London Overground and DLR make their own arrangements
              for replacement services.<br>
              Page 14<br>
              6. Quality Incentive Contracts<br>
              Quality Incentive Contracts were introduced in 2001 and have
              delivered significant improvements in service quality and passenger
              numbers. These contracts are based on gross cost contracts but also
              contain incentive provisions in the form of performance payment
              bonuses &amp; deductions and the option of a two year contract
              extension. The routes/contracts are tendered for an initial period
              of five years and when awarded contain a specific Minimum
              Performance Standard (MPS) which will generally be fixed for the
              life of the contract and which reflects the particular
              characteristics of the route. The contract price is adjusted each
              year in respect of inflation on the anniversary of the deadline
              date for tender submission. A formula which is designed to be
              representative of the actual movements in the cost base using a
              number of indices (e.g. labour rates, the Retail Price Index and
              fuel costs) is used to calculate these adjustments<br>
              6.1. Incentive Provisions<br>
              In addition to the requirement to operate the scheduled mileage
              three further incentive provisions exist within the Quality
              Incentive Contract. The original two provisions are performance
              payments based on the reliability of the service and contract
              extensions. From 2008, a second generation of performance payments
              has covered driving quality and is expected to be extended to cover
              vehicle condition from 2009.<br>
              6.1.1. Reliability Performance Payments<br>
              These are calculated on an annual basis by comparing the Operatorâ€Ÿs
              annual reliability performance on each route against the contracted
              MPS. Payments are based on a graduated scale with an increase or
              decrease in the payment for every whole 0.10 minute change in
              Excess Wait Time (EWT) for High Frequency routes and every whole
              2.0 percentage point change in percentage On Time for Low Frequency
              routes. Bonus payments are paid at a rate of 1.5% of the contract
              price for each step above the standard. Deductions are made at a
              rate of 1% of the contract price for each step below the standard.
              Bonus and deduction payments are capped at 15% and 10% respectively
              of the contract price.<br>
              6.1.2. Contract Extensions<br>
              Under the terms of the contract an Operator is entitled to an
              automatic two year extension of the contract if it meets or exceeds
              the reliability â€œExtension Thresholdâ€� criteria set in the tender
              documentation for that route. This reliability threshold is
              slightly higher but related to the reliability MPS. Where a route
              qualifies for an extension, it is offered on the basis of the
              current contract provisions. The operator can choose to accept or
              reject the contract extension. If the operator declines to accept
              the extension, the route is tendered in the usual manner. If the
              extension is offered, the route is withdrawn from that yearâ€Ÿs
              tendering programme, and is tendered two years later.<br>
              Page 15<br>
              A small minority of routes are not operated under full incentive
              mechanisms (e.g. stand alone night routes, school services and
              other very low frequency services) because the resources required
              to monitor the reliability are out of proportion with the scale of
              the route. Furthermore some routes may operate under partial
              incentive provisions e.g. Performance Payments may be applicable
              but contract extensions may not be available for routes funded by
              some third parties. These are detailed in each ITT.<br>
              6.1.3. Quality Performance Payments<br>
              Building on the success of the earlier reliability incentive
              schemes, a second generation of payments based on driving quality
              (including customer service) and the presentation of vehicles
              (internally and externally) is being introduced. A combination of
              Mystery Traveller Surveys (whilst the bus is in service) and
              vehicle inspections (at terminals) throughout the day assess these
              aspects of service, and provides scores for each bus garage. These
              scores lead to payments or deductions against a network wide
              standard rewarding those companies which achieve higher levels of
              performance.<br>
              6.2. Minimum Performance Standards<br>
              The primary objective of bus operators is to safely operate all of
              the scheduled mileage and adhere fully to the level of service
              shown in the published timetable. London Buses sets specific MPS in
              respect of the quality of service to be provided. The measurement
              criteria for reliability used depend on whether the route is
              designated High or Low frequency, and are detailed further in
              Section 7.4. The specific reliability standard for each route
              depends on a set of consistently applied criteria, including the
              length and average journey time of the route, the type of areas it
              serves (such as congested town centres) and recovery time available
              at termini. The standards for driver quality and vehicle
              presentation are London wide.<br>
              6.3. Payment Adjustments for Service Reliability<br>
              Whilst operators are expected to operate the full contracted
              service this is not always possible for various unpredictable
              reasons, including mechanical breakdowns, staff sickness,
              roadworks, road closures and other incidents on or near buses.
              London Buses specifies an acceptable minimum performance standard
              for mileage operated for each route. Any mileage that is not
              operated can be split into two categories: â€œDeductible Lost
              Mileageâ€� (mileage not operated but considered to be within the
              Operatorâ€Ÿs reasonable control i.e. staff absences, mechanical
              breakdown); and â€œNon Deductible Lost Mileageâ€� (beyond the
              Operatorâ€Ÿs reasonable control i.e. adverse traffic
              conditions).<br>
              Operators are not paid for any mileage not operated under the
              category of â€œDeductible Lost Mileageâ€�, and a deduction is made in
              proportion to the<br>
              Page 16<br>
              annual contract price and scheduled mileage. Deductions are not
              made for â€œNon Deductible Lost Mileageâ€�, although poor performance
              in this area is kept under review.<br>
              6.4. Contract Payments and Revenue<br>
              London Buses operates on the basis of 4 week accounting periods,
              with 13 periods each year running from April to March. Contract
              payments are made by BACS. 75% of the contract price is paid during
              the relevant period. The balance, less deductions for Deductible
              Lost Mileage, is paid at the end of the following period. Payments
              (and deductions) under the reliability incentive scheme are made
              annually, and for the more recently introduced driving and vehicle
              quality incentive schemes quarterly.<br>
              6.5. Summary of Responsibilities<br>
              The contractual and tendering system places responsibilities on

              7. Measuring Quality of Performance<br>
              7.1. Targets<br>
              The Mayor and the TfL Board set performance targets for London
              Buses within TfLâ€Ÿs Business Plan.<br>
              7.2. Monitoring Systems<br>
              Londonâ€Ÿs Buses have seen a considerable increase in quality
              standards since 1990, and continually seeks to maintain year on
              year improvements to the service provided to passengers. To do
              this, there are a number of performance monitoring systems in
              operation, in addition to any other system operators may use for
              their own management processes. The data obtained by London Buses
              is normally shared with the appropriate operator, and network level
              data is also published for many measures, and is normally available
              on TfLâ€Ÿs website. London Buses tries to avoid duplicating the
              monitoring systems of other UK organisations. The current
              measurements and monitoring are as follows:<br>
              7.3. Mileage Operated (excluding traffic and other non deductible
              losses)<br>
              This measure is used as an incentive by London Buses, as deductions
              from contract payments are made for mileage that is lost for
              reasons that are reasonably within the control of the operator.
              These include non availability of staff and vehicles not being
              mechanically fit to be used on the road. This has shown a vast
              improvement over the last 10-15 years.<br>
              7.4. Reliability<br>
              This forms part of the assessment of an operatorâ€Ÿs ability to
              schedule, control and adjust services. It also forms the basis of
              financial bonuses and deductions on incentivised contracts. The
              roadside surveys to collect this data cover approximately 3-5% of
              the service, although it is anticipated that vehicle tracking
              technology will gradually replace the current human observations.
              The measurements are different for high and low frequency
              routes:<br>
              7.4.1. Regularity on High Frequency services<br>
              On services that are defined as High Frequency â€“ five or more buses
              per hour throughout most of the week â€“ London Buses measures the
              interval between buses and compares it to the advertised frequency.
              The aim is to ensure that the buses are evenly spaced, and that on
              average a passenger should not have to wait for longer than half of
              the advertised frequency. On High Frequency routes, it is
              considered that passengers can â€œturn up and goâ€� as the waiting time
              should be relatively short and the timetable is less important. The
              measure is expressed as â€œExcess Wait Timeâ€� (EWT), which is defined
              as the extra time that passengers have had to wait above the
              expected waiting period. The objective is to reduce EWT to
              zero.<br>
              Page 19<br>
              Additionally, â€žlong gapsâ€Ÿ in service are measured, which tend to
              indicate more fundamental problems such as cancelled buses,
              curtailments and poor service control leading to â€žbunchingâ€Ÿ.<br>
              7.4.2. Punctuality on Low Frequency services<br>
              On Low Frequency routes - four buses per hour or less throughout
              most of the week â€“ London Buses measures how close the departure
              time from the stop is to the advertised timetable. On these routes,
              the timetable is more important as passengers are more likely to
              rely on the published departure time when planning their journey.
              The measure is expressed as a percentage of departures that are â€œOn
              Timeâ€�. On Time is a window from 2Â½ minutes earlier than expected to
              five minutes later than expected. The objective is to increase â€œOn
              Timeâ€� departures to 100%. Additionally the percentage of journeys
              running â€œEarlyâ€� is also monitored, where early is defined as a bus
              departing between 2Â½ and eight minutes ahead of the schedule. It is
              normally considered that there is little excuse for early running,
              as passengers may not have arrived at the stop.<br>
              7.5. Driver and Vehicle Quality Monitoring<br>
              The Driver and Vehicle Quality Monitoring Programme provides robust
              and actionable data on which to base financial incentives to bus
              operating companies to improve performance (as detailed in Section
              6.1.3 above). The programme builds on earlier Mystery Traveller
              Surveys and objectively monitors service quality and compliance
              with contractual requirements utilising auditing and â€žmystery
              shoppingâ€Ÿ survey techniques to measure pre-defined, key aspects of
              service delivery. The research is conducted on London Busesâ€Ÿ behalf
              by a leading market research agency, and comprises two compatible
              surveys: Static audit of buses in service assessed at bus stands to
              evaluate â€žfixedâ€Ÿ aspects of service delivery (e.g. etching,
              graffiti, structural damage and in-grained dirt). Around 17,000
              surveys are carried out per annum. Mystery shopping surveys whilst
              the vehicle is in service to assess vehicle handling, customer
              interaction and aspects of the vehicle affected by buses being in
              service. Around 33,000 surveys per annum are carried out.<br>
              The data is collated and following a quality assurance process is
              shared with the operators so that they can take action to address
              any areas of weakness that are identified. The results are used by
              London Buses to generate the payments (or deductions) under the
              driving and vehicle quality incentive regime.<br>
              Page 20<br>
              7.6. Driver Quality Monitoring<br>
              This is a separate independent survey carried out by London Busesâ€Ÿ
              specialist contractor which covertly undertakes over 6,500
              assessments each year across the London Bus network to assess
              driving skills. It differs from the assessments detailed in Section
              7.5 by focussing as much on the technical ability of the driver â€“
              such as use of mirrors and lane discipline - as it does on
              passenger consideration. For each assessment, a driver receives a
              graded score for a series of measures such as speed, road position
              and braking and there are over twenty categories per assessment.
              This level of monitoring is rare, in that most employers of
              professional drivers undertake no such monitoring of their staff,
              and manage their professional drivers solely on the basis of claims
              or accidents. A combination of initiatives has led to a steady
              improvement in the scores in the recent past.<br>
              7.7. Engineering Quality Monitoring<br>
              London Busesâ€Ÿ independent contractor undertakes regular checks on
              the maintenance procedures and mechanical condition of the vehicles
              used on its contracts. This is undertaken by a thorough examination
              of about 25% of each operatorâ€Ÿs fleet throughout the year, similar
              to an â€žMOTâ€Ÿ test for cars. The examinations are conducted by
              trained staff working to the same criteria. Any defects are noted
              and given a score, with higher scores for more serious defects. The
              key measure is the average number of points per vehicles, with a
              target of zero. The monitoring also includes the maintenance
              procedures, and the operatorsâ€Ÿ vehicle pass rate at annual
              test.<br>
              7.8. Customer Satisfaction<br>
              There are three London Buses Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS),
              focusing on Bus Services, Night Buses and Bus Stations which have
              been undertaken since 1997. These enable London Buses and bus
              operators to monitor customersâ€Ÿ satisfaction with the quality of
              services provided and identify areas for improvement. Face-to-face
              interviews are conducted with passengers alighting from buses.
              Questions relate to the journey that has just been made including
              overall satisfaction with journey just made, information, safety
              and security, cleanliness, reliability and staff behaviour.<br>
              7.9. Public Correspondence Data<br>
              London Buses collates all public communications made by phone,
              email or letter. This data is analysed at route level on themes
              including driving standards. This helps London Buses to understand
              and address specific concerns.<br>
              7.10. Contract Compliance Audits<br>
              To ensure that operators comply with the specifications in the
              contract, London Busesâ€Ÿ Contract Compliance team make regular
              visits to all operating garages. These audits help to ensure that:
              there are sufficiently rigorous administration systems in place to
              handle and account for on-bus revenue and London Buses owned or
              managed equipment. They also ensure that lost<br>
              Page 21<br>
              mileage is reported correctly so that the correct contract payments
              are claimed; and that drivers comply with working time and driving
              time legislation.<br>
              7.11. Other Sanctions and Remedies<br>
              Operatorsâ€Ÿ performance is regularly reviewed by senior London Buses
              staff. They examine a range of indicators, including mileage
              operated, reliability, driving and engineering standards as well as
              the measures detailed above. Unsatisfactory performance is
              discussed with individual operators, and if necessary operators may
              be required to produce and implement action plans to resolve
              performance issues. Current and past performance is taken into
              account in the evaluation of tenders and recommendation for award
              of new contracts. London Buses usually resolves any performance
              issues through normal contract management. However if performance
              continues to be poor and it is considered that it cannot be
              resolved by other means, as an ultimate sanction London Buses
              retains the right to terminate any contract.<br>
              7.12. Safety<br>
              A range of data is used by London Buses as part of the assessment
              of an operatorâ€Ÿs ability to provide a safe service and failure can
              result in the loss of a contract. Unsatisfactory performance can
              also lead to the failure to win new contracts. The incentive is not
              directly related to payments/deductions due to the importance of
              avoiding the suggestion that safety of operation is in any way a
              negotiable trade off against cost. Safety is not generally measured
              against â€žfront lineâ€Ÿ passenger experience, but from an insight into
              an operatorâ€Ÿs standards. Much of the work is based on visits to
              operating premises and interviews with operational staff. These
              include checks on policies, procedures and risk assessments. These
              visits are followed by a report highlighting areas of concern and
              an action plan. This plan is then reviewed and forms the basis of
              the next inspection. In addition to Driver and Engineering Quality
              Monitoring, as described above, operators provide data regarding
              all accidents and incidents which occur whilst a bus is in service.
              This information is collated and analysed by London Buses.<br>
              7.13. Passenger &amp; Staff security<br>
              The entire London Bus fleet is fitted with CCTV and recording
              equipment. This is used to identify individuals who commit
              offences, against both other passengers and the vehicle. It can
              also be used to assist in the investigation of injury and insurance
              claims.<br>
              London Buses operates a central communications facility,
              CentreComm, and each bus is fitted with a two-way radio system
              which allows drivers to issue an<br>
              Page 22<br>
              emergency call if they require assistance. The radio system is
              otherwise used to communicate information about disruptions to
              service. TfL funds the Transport Operational Command Unit, a
              dedicated team including staff from the Metropolitan Police which
              is in place to deal with surface transport related policing issues,
              which includes enforcement of bus lanes, supporting revenue
              protection operations and investigating and prosecuting fare
              evaders.<br>
              Page 23<br>
              8. Environment<br>
              8.1. London Buses and the environment<br>
              Environmental issues are of increasing concern in London, with much
              of the debate focused on transport. TfL is committed to minimising
              harm to the environment. The provision of a comprehensive, safe and
              efficient public transport network in Greater London (including the
              bus network) is an important element. TfL complies with the
              relevant environmental legislation, and follows the Mayorâ€Ÿs Air
              Quality Strategy, which specifies key objectives for Londonâ€Ÿs bus
              fleet.<br>
              8.2. Lowering emissions<br>
              Tenders for bus services specify that new vehicles should be to the
              latest legal European emissions standards, and operators are
              encouraged to introduce higher standards sooner than required.
              Buses on the London Bus network have a minimum standard of Euro 2,
              and are fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters which reduce the
              levels of fine particles, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons in
              exhaust gases by over 90%. It is also recognised that driving
              techniques can reduce emissions, and this is included within the
              BTEC training for bus drivers (see Section 9.3). London Buses is
              also trialling the latest advances in vehicle technology, including
              hydrogen fuel cell buses which have no polluting emissions on the
              road. Diesel-electric hybrid buses (which are powered by batteries
              that are charged by regenerative braking and smaller engines, which
              produce lower emissions than a full size diesel engine) are being
              trialled more widely, and if successful will be phased in across
              the bus network from 2012.<br>
              Page 24<br>
              9. Current and Future Initiatives<br>
              9.1. Smartcards and Cashless Buses<br>
              Oyster is TfLâ€Ÿs travel smartcard. Passengers can put their period
              â€œTravelcardâ€� or â€œBus Passâ€� season ticket on it, add electronic
              travel value to pay as you go, or have a combination of both.
              Oyster cards are also reusable. This means that when the season
              ticket expires it can be replaced on the same Oyster card, and when
              electronic travel value runs out, it can just be topped up. London
              Buses is attempting to reduce the number of cash transactions on
              buses, to speed up boarding and improve security and driversâ€Ÿ
              safety. A number of busy routes and areas already have cashless
              boarding â€“ passengers need to have a season ticket, an Oyster card
              or to purchase a ticket from the roadside ticket machine before
              they board the bus.<br>
              9.2. Bus Priority<br>
              The bus priority team develop and deliver highway and traffic
              management schemes to improve journey times and service reliability
              for bus passengers. These schemes include bus lanes, junction
              improvements and traffic signal priority. This involves working
              with other parts of TfL Surface Transport and the London boroughs.
              Some schemes are individual local projects to deal with a specific
              local problem. In other cases schemes for entire bus routes or
              network corridors are introduced. These measures improve bus
              reliability, protect bus passengers from excess delays and
              facilitate improvements capacity of bus services.<br>
              9.3. Bus Driver and Service Controller Training<br>
              Raising training standards and achieving greater consistency in the
              training of front line bus operating staff is a key objective for
              London Buses. To help achieve these aims, London Buses commissioned
              two bespoke BTEC qualifications in consultation with bus operators,
              training providers and trades unions. The two qualifications (one
              aimed at drivers, the other aimed at service controllers) were
              developed in conjunction with Edexcel, the examinations award body.
              Both qualifications have been designed so that the staff taking
              them are able to demonstrate their ability to do their job
              competently and to a consistent standard across the London bus
              network. The degree of assessment required and paperwork associated
              with the qualifications has been kept to the minimum, but it still
              allows staff to show what they are capable of and what they
              understand about the industry they work in. Responsibility for
              delivering the training rests with the individual bus operators. At
              the end of the training, provided the candidate has successfully
              met all of the assessment requirements, they will achieve their
              BTEC qualification.<br>
              Page 25<br>
              9.4. iBUS<br>
              iBus is the latest radio and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL)
              system for buses. It ensures that the service controllers at
              garages know the exact location of all buses fitted with the system
              at all times. Using a combination of technologies, including
              satellite tracking and GPRS data transfer, iBus keeps track of
              where Londonâ€Ÿs buses are, allowing bus controllers to regulate
              services to make them more reliable. Thanks to on board â€žnext stopâ€Ÿ
              audio-visual announcements, passengers know where their bus is,
              even if theyâ€Ÿre on an unfamiliar route. They will also benefit from
              more reliable real-time information on Countdown signs at bus
              stops. CentreComm â€“ London Busesâ€Ÿ 24/7 Emergency Command and
              Control Centre â€“ will be able to use the on-bus PA system to
              communicate directly with passengers in the event of an emergency.
              Another benefit to passengers is that in case of the driver making
              emergency radio contact following an accident or emergency,
              CentreComm will immediately be able to pinpoint the precise
              location of a specific bus, so any necessary assistance can be
              despatched immediately.<br>
              9.5. Countdown<br>
              Countdown is the name of the real-time display information at 2000
              selected bus stops that predict the arrival time for buses. As the
              iBus project unlocks the full potential of Countdown, displays will
              be replaced and additional displays installed at more stops across
              the network.<br>

              <br>
              But i sure have lots of experience in London, Franchised bus
              operators are horrible, betcha SG government officials went to
              visit Metroline, but all there saw the goodside of Metroline but
              din see the street, LIVE version of Metroline...<br>
              <br>
              Metroline 390 runs fairly ok during the days but when it comes to
              night ops, it fails terribly, have to wait more than 20minutes at
              times, commuters really give up and transfer buses or walk further
              to take the TUBE and it would be more terrible if you are waiting
              in the cold winter...<br>
              <br>
              Tfl says bus operators must ensure bus arrival times are strictly
              adhered to... try telling tt to the driver driving from the bus, if
              you would not want to walk to where the bus is standing, ie if
              there are 2 buses(2 different routes) at the bus stop, chances of
              the 2nd bus stopping in front of you is practically zilch, it will
              just zoom past as it has a timeline to meet...<br>
              <br>
              On another occasion on 390, i have let fellow passengers alight and
              was the last to alight, bloody driver slam the door on me, i have
              to force myself out through the partially closed door.<br>
              <br>
              There are many untold horror stories untold on London buses and the

              Exactly. Perth has its fair share of horror stories. Probably not far from what is happening in London.

              <p>LTA could use some experience from rail where they procured rolling stock. Fleet procurement will have to go through <a href="http://www.gebiz.gov.sg">GeBiz</a> which is somewhat more transparent.</p>

              <p>If this is the case it would be funny if the buses do not have a standard livery. 1 bus route can have sbs and smrt buses because all buses belong to lta lol</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i guess standard livery will take place as soon as 2016. Which means to say smrt may have just wasted money to paint new livery on the new buses</p>

              <p>Remember purchase and ownership of buses under the London contracting system falls under the operators, not Transport for London. There are many mid-life buses that are cascaded to other regions within by operators the UK when the contract is lost or requirements change during renewal. A review of the system in 2009 for Transport for London suggested that this method is not seen as being sustainable in the long-term by operators. This is especially true for the NBfL.</p>
              <p>Transdev Melbourne had to bear the legacy of previous operators' choice of fleet purchasing when they took over 500 buses, consisting of no less than 25 different bus models!</p>
              <p>Dealing with so many different models is going to be a nightmare to whoever is in charge of maintenance, and drive up costs (which this government is seeking to reduce under the competitive tender model). Training is going to be a major issue as well.</p>
