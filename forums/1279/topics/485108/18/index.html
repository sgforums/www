              <p>My initial comments:</p>
              <p>Pretty obvious the government wants to keep the lobbyists out.
                                                  Prospective operators must sign the NDA before they are allowed to
                                                  receive a copy of the tender documents.</p>
              <p>Having previously seen a copy of a Transperth parcel tender and
                                                  the level of detail it contains, I can fully understand why the
                                                  government is insisting on a NDA.</p>
              <div id="post-body-11034804" class="body">
              <p>The area tendered is too large in my opinion...this effectively
                                                  grants the winner a mandated monopoly for a period of at least 5
                                                  years. The "wooing a girl" analogy is a pretty poor example given
                                                  by LTA in the video. Where is the competition <em>after</em> the tendering process?</p>
              <p>I have to remind everyone that a new operator does not
                                                  necessitate a better operator. I know of Australian bus operators
                                                  who are more than ready to throw you off the bus for anything they
                                                  do not like and they <em>are</em> bidding for this parcel
                                                  tender.</p>
              <p>On the aspect of customer service, I am very disappointed with what I am seeing in the tendering model. LTA must take on a greater role in customer service and
                                                  have a part in investigating complaints, or else the passenger
                                                  basically has little recourse because the operator is free to act
                                                  like a Mafia.</p>
              <p>The current situation of bumping complaints to the
                                                  operator will be inadequate under the new model. The operator will be free to filter off complaints that are not escalated to LTA and treat them lightly, which is already happening right now. I am worried that given the winning operator has to set up their own customer management system, this might actually be the case.</p>

              <p>- At least 6 interested bidders<br>- SMRT is a confirmed bidder (of course, it involves their territory)<br>- SBS Transit "keep its cards close to the chest" (as usual)<br>- More London/UK operators express interest: Arriva, Transdev, RATP<br>- Existing operators likely to make recruitment of drivers of prospective foreign bidders difficult, to hinder the chances of their bids succeeding.</p>

              <p>Hmm, correct me if Im wrong. </p>
              <p>Looking at the bus contracting model, I believe all the bus assets, bus stops/interchange/depots and panels will be under LTA. Hence, my interpretation is that all the buses will be changed to LTA livery and bus number plates will be all changed to the LTA colours. The buses to be used on the routes tendered out will be the current bus assets that SBS and SMRT have, but managed by LTA now to be given to the bus routes regardless of operators. So, we probably will not really know which operator is managing which bus routes...</p>
              <p>In 5 years time, I believe, it will mark the end of seeing the iconic SBS Transit and SMRT liveries. </p>

              <p>Hmm, correct me if Im wrong. </p>
              <p>Looking at the bus contracting model, I believe all the bus
              assets, bus stops/interchange/depots and panels will be under LTA.
              Hence, my interpretation is that all the buses will be changed to
              LTA livery and bus number plates will be all changed to the LTA
              colours. The buses to be used on the routes tendered out will be
              the current bus assets that SBS and SMRT have, but managed by LTA
              now to be given to the bus routes regardless of operators. So, we
              probably will not really know which operator is managing which bus
              routes...</p>

              <p>Summary of Today's article:</p>
              <p>- At least 6 interested bidders<br> - SMRT is a confirmed bidder (of course, it involves their
              territory)<br> - SBS Transit "keep its cards close to the chest" (as usual)<br> - More London/UK operators express interest: Arriva, Transdev,
              RATP<br> - Existing operators likely to make recruitment of drivers of
              prospective foreign bidders difficult, to hinder the chances of
              their bids succeeding.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For the last point regarding recruitment of drivers, there is apparently a large enough supply of people willing to be bus captain, but most are being held back by red tape and lack of resources.</p>
              <p>From what I understand from a friend, the current next training slot for sbst drivers starts 3 months away in december, while smrt recruitment is overloaded with applicants that the lead time from application to contract signing is at least a month.</p>

              <p>I see your point on customer feedback and I think that's a good point to make on the upcoming parcel tender system.</p>
              <p>It makes more sense that all feedback are routed through LTA and issued a specific case number. At least all feedbacks (be it nonsense or useful) can be tracked and replied within a baseline service standard as well. They could also review these to get a feel of what's on the ground.</p>
              <p>I am disappointed too if this path is taken.</p>

              <p>The applicants currently are mostly non locals (majority from our neighbour up north), but i'm surprised too to see that the bottleneck is now not with limited supply of drivers and rather with the HR/training.</p>
              <p>It can't be totally blamed on the current PTOs too, since new bus captains have to undergo a ~30 days training with sbst and ~7 weeks with smrt regardless whether they have a CL4/5 license and/or Bus Driver Vocational License and/or speaks acceptable amount of english.</p>

              <p>My initial comments:</p>
              <p>Pretty obvious the government wants to keep the lobbyists out.
              Prospective operators must sign the NDA before they are allowed to
              receive a copy of the tender documents.</p>
              <p>Having previously seen a copy of a Transperth parcel tender and
              the level of detail it contains, I can fully understand why the
              government is insisting on a NDA.</p>
              <div class="">
              <p>The area tendered is too large in my opinion...this effectively
              grants the winner a mandated monopoly for a period of at least 5
              years. The "wooing a girl" analogy is a pretty poor example given
              by LTA in the video. Where is the competition <em>after</em> the
              tendering process?</p>
              <p>I have to remind everyone that a new operator does not
              necessitate a better operator. I know of Australian bus operators
              who are more than ready to throw you off the bus for anything they
              do not like and they <em>are</em> bidding for this parcel
              tender.</p>
              <p>On the aspect of customer service, I am very disappointed with
              what I am seeing in the tendering model. LTA must take on a greater
              role in customer service and have a part in investigating
              complaints, or else the passenger basically has little recourse
              because the operator is free to act like a Mafia.</p>
              <p>The current situation of bumping complaints to the operator will
              be inadequate under the new model. The operator will be free to
              filter off complaints that are not escalated to LTA and treat them
              lightly, which is already happening right now. I am worried that
              given the winning operator has to set up their own customer
              management system, this might actually be the case.</p>
