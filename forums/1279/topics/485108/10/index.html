              Wanted to feedback to SBS Transit. But without photographic evidence. I am not sure if SBS Transit will believe me. By the time I saw the EDS and took out my phone, the bus has already skipped the stop or if I do manage to snap, the photo will likely be very blur and unusable.
              
              This incident was not the first time. Years back, there was a 10e BC who did this (9636H) mid route (after suntec bus stop). He did this repeatedly. So I managed to grab a shot and sent it in. Never seen that BC on 10e afterwards.

              They can investigate through eds data diagnostic tool..Got several case involving SMRT BCs..
              
              Side note i see the 3rd player will have a big share of pie over SMRT bus in 5 years time.
              Happen everywhere if Gov body interfere..just like airport..The one who suffer d most is long service employee with cut in bonuses and allowances.Usual practice bosses will hire more China drivers.

              <p>Bro, you will know the standard reply/template LTA will give.</p>
              <p>(1) Aware of the high demand on this route, operator has injected additional xx number of trips since DD/MM/201XX. Will closely monitor the situation and adjust accordingly to the number of trips. Never answer that the current fleet is sufficient to cope with the load.</p>
              <p>(2)Sharing you with the future plans, like the DTL in 2016 and constructions of high flyers at junctions of CCK /Bt Panjang and woodlands. Which will smooth the traffic flows.</p>
              <p>(3) Offer alternatives like the NR3 which costs $4.50 (not too sure how much it costs per trip now). Somemore NR services only available on eve of PH and Sat.  Other services like Sv700,960,972. As if I dont know. If a person is heading towards Teckwhye and CCK area, these are not an options.</p>
              <p>(4) Seeking your patience to have the plan implemented. Guess must wait for another seven more years.</p>
              <p>(5) Operator commercial decision to decide what last bus timings</p>

              <p>1800-CALL-LTA and talk to the human operator the moment you see this. Tell them you will escalate the matter to the press if they do not give you an adequate reply.</p>

              <p>Well, I think bus fares will be lowered instead. Because when LTA takes over the depots, buses, interchanges &amp; terminals, it will have more sources to cover operating costs. For instance, it can lease wall, floor &amp; bus spaces for people to paste advertisements, &amp; create commercial spaces for people to rent &amp; do business, to collect advertising fees &amp; rental, to help cover operating costs.</p>

              <p>Yes, the bus fares will increase, but I think only in short term (within the first five years), because LTA has to pay SBS Transit &amp; SMRT for buses, depots, interchanges &amp; terminals, and apply a common LTA livery &amp; design on them thereafter. LTA will incur a higher amount of costs, thus it is inevitable that bus fares has to increase during this transition period, otherwise it is our tax that will increase.</p>

              <p>In addition, before anyone can work in LTA, they must have attained some kind of mastery and qualifications in Human Geography (in particular, in transportation)(on travelling patterns, trends, etc.), Management (on how to allocate resources effectively and obtain the best value from the resources deployed), Mathematics/Accountancy (on how to set transport fares, etc.), etc.</p>
              <p>Prior to joining LTA &amp; when they are in LTA, they study case studies, research, reports, etc. from all around the world. They should know the benefits and consequences of various measures and using the knowledge they have, apply the measures in Singapore that would solve the problems and improve the conditions in the transportation here.</p>
              <p>I am confident they know what is best for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Well, we have to understand that many things do not happen overnight. It takes time to review, plan and execute measures. I am sure LTA attends to every feedback that we make, but it takes time for them to read everything.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, when you feedback something to them, maybe they are already working on it, but they cannot tell you anything, because things are still in planning stages and nothing is confirmed. So they just give you a vague respond.</p>
              <p>Well, I think the issue here is only about how LTA responds to our emails, nothing else. If LTA improves on its Customer Relations, I think everyone will be happy already.</p>

              <p>And the PTOs usually refuse to budge, unless they know what avenues actually attract the attention of PTOs to fix the problems (of which, one of them is through the media).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, to my knowledge it is the bus lobbyists who know these avenues and have been using them very often to fuel their self-interested motivations.</p>

              <p>Well, I think bus fares will be lowered instead.
              Because when LTA takes over the depots, buses,
              interchanges &amp; terminals, it will have more sources
              to cover operating costs. For instance, it can lease wall,
              floor &amp; bus spaces for people to paste
              advertisements, &amp; create commercial spaces for people to
              rent &amp; do business, to collect advertising fees &amp;
              rental, to help cover operating costs.</p>

              <p>I do not think fares will go down. LTA is already facing a shortfall of fare revenue to cover the costs of operation. Also, many in Singapore are captive commuters to public transportation (i.e. they do not have a viable alternative form of transport).</p>
              <p>Many state and city governments around the world, especially conservative ones, do not like to use their coffers to subsidise commuters; they rather raise fares. The only notable exception I am aware of is China.</p>
