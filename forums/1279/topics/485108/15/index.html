              <p>Hi mr sbst191, why not? The elderly are less mobile. They walk lesser from hougang st 21 kovan hawker centre to take sbs 115 to their home in hougang ave 3 and vice versa in both directions. Sbs transit realized this. Sbs 113 does not go to hougang ave 3 directly although it is within walking distance from hougang ave 1. Nothing to do with foreigner workers. Moreover, the resources on sbs 115 is so little that it does not warrant the removal of this service. Public bus service is for all residents not just for majority of residents. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, sometimes when you read others saying withdraw the bus services when there are people using it, you will feel angry too. Either they just base on their own biased thinking or they never really go and analyse the loadings. Sbs transit has already adjusted sbs115 timings to 30 min to 50 min 1 bus to cater specially for it yet people still just want it withdrawn. Oh my goodness. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, so did the majority of the bus services in Singapore cater to the majority of residents? Then what is there to complain when 1 or 2 buses are used to run sbs 115 to cater to a special group of people? All bus services must cater to all types of residents, be it majority or minority. Did you get this point? </p>
              <p>Let's be realistic. Sbst and smrt increase fare is not related to bus services catered to a a special group of people. All those people who spit on their ez link cards still use back their cards to take public transport, right? To protest against increase in bus fares is ok. To think that increase is related to wasting resources on a bus service is not ok. By the way, sbs 115 got sufficient ridership to maintain its 30-50 min frequency. Moreover, removal of 1 or 2 buses for sbs 115 is not going to save enough resources for sbs transit not to increase fares.</p>
              <p>Sbs transit is reasonable. They want withdraw sbs 115 initially but MP steps in. What's wrong? Reasons given by residents to MP to clear the doubts with sbs transit are valid. If reasons are not viable, sbs transit will have already removed it irregardless of reasons. </p>
              <p>Did anybody protest when sbs transit cancels sbs 409 a non-basic service for the parks in end march 2014? When this service is gone, bus fare still increases now right? Cheers.</p>

              <p>** clap clap **</p>
              <p>your remarks here have started annoying me to no end bcos it is full of double standards.</p>
              <p>answer my below questions.</p>
              <p>1. The whole stretch of Haig road does not have old people? Not a single service plying this road while Tanjong Katong gets all the services. Can't one of the service between 43/76/135 be routed via Haig road. Is it going to really inconvenience or provide a major relief to Haig road residents? Let me answer. Your response will be launch a new service. Is funds endless when the job can be done by simply re-routing one of the services?</p>
              <p>2. Sv 115 provides link between HG ave 3 and Kovan MRT (only in one direction). Why has LTA not yet re-routed the service to cater to more people needs. I am sure lot of people around HG ave 3 will prefer to take bus from Kovan to ave 3 rather than take 51/151 from HG interchange. No proper effort made here.</p>
              <p>3. Sv 18 is important for providing link for tampines ave 7 residents? This service is redundant today but you justify it. Ave 7 is already pampered with around 10 services.

              relief to Haig road residents? Let me answer. Your response will be
              launch a new service. Is funds endless when the job can be done by
              simply re-routing one of the services?</p>
              <p>2. Sv 115 provides link between HG ave 3 and Kovan MRT (only in
              one direction). Why has LTA not yet re-routed the service to cater
              to more people needs. I am sure lot of people around HG ave 3 will
              prefer to take bus from Kovan to ave 3 rather than take 51/151 from
              HG interchange. No proper effort made here.</p>
              <p>3. Sv 18 is important for providing link for tampines ave 7
              residents? This service is redundant today but you justify it. Ave
              7 is already pampered with around 10 services. On contrary ave 9,

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, thanks for the clap clap. </p>
              <p>Your thread also annoys me but I am still taking it positively. </p>
              <p>1. What makes you so sure that tanjong katong road will not be inconvenienced? What makes you think another new service cannot be introduced. Not everytime most bus services need to be loaded to medium or high or extremely high. What is wrong with getting another service to ply haig road and provide some link or loop? Your concept of using up most of the seats to the maximum is good but it does not work all the time. With MRT around, buses are just to supplement it. </p>
              <p>2. Sbs 115 currently brings people from hougang st 21 kovan bus terminal to hougang ave 3. So your point is out. Shucks man. </p>
              <p>3. Sbs 18 is important for bedok north rd and bedok north ave 2 residents as per my earlier email. Since when did I say it is important for tampines ave 7 residents? Do not anyhow say I say when you read carelessly. Shucks man. </p>
              <p>4. Since when sbs 27A and sbs 36B have come to imply double standards? Shucks man. Anyhow link idea just to rebut???</p>
              <p>Now we know who is the one who anyhow links stuff and claims objectives when the points given are totally no coherence and linkage. I am totally disappointed with such a total lack of ideas in such article which is more of an indirect attack. Over to you, man!</p>

                  <p>As for sbs 18, earlier you say it can be withdrawn. Now you say
                  it cannot be withdrawn but still it can be amended. Please make up
                  your mind. Do not cover all angles for yourself in just less than
                  20 min. Withdrawn, amended all you say it! Cheers. </p>

Why do you need a new service? When either sv 43/76 that duplicate all the way upto AMK Ave 3/YCK road junction? Haven't you heard/read/observed so many instances when 43/76 are together and then one of them does not get well-utilized. Routing through Haig road will provide relief to the people around those areas without using precious resources when one of these two can do the job. So very typical LTA answer, again stressing on my point, LTA just does not want to take concrete steps. Seems like only interested in spending the pool of money it has on new services when with some tweaks existing services can be re-routed.</p>
              <p>2. Should 115 not also serve as Kovan MRT connection to HG Ave 3 residents? Didn't you read what I mentioned? You can add 2 more buses under BSEP (will really help elderly/commuters) and just start service from HGDEP instead of maintaining 1-bay terminal at HG St 21. Don't you have 48 from BNDEP, 185 from SLBP? </p>
              <p>I have to go now, but you answer me on these 2 and I will come back on the other 2 points. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Old 28 route? Not bad le, but should ply to the Esso station near Tamp Eco Green Park, then turn to Ave 7. Current 18 route feels like a support route for 8 at AM peak. Wonder who gives the DDs and Bendies to 18 last time.</p>
              <p>26 can divert to ply Chai Chee first. And if 115 is for elderly, they should deploy Citaro instead (supposingly more elderly friendly)</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, i am afraid you have short memory. </p>
              <p>1. Haig road issue was already discussed in an much earlier thread a few months back. I do not see any need to repeat everything all over again and again. I dont work for LTA and i dont get a cent from them. So do not link me to them.</p>
              <p>2. Yes you can amend and modify sbs 115 route. I am fine with it. What sbst191 was suggesting to remove completely. So what double standards do I have???Your point is an extension of his point which i rebutted sensibly. Nothing to do with modification of route at that time when he simply suggested to remove.</p>
              <p>Shell station ideas on sbs 18 has nothing to do with your initial claims of tampines ave 7 which was just accused on me when i did not say so. I have merely said sbs 18 is needed for residents of bedok north road and bedok north ave 2 which is important when sbst191 wanted to remove. So your claims are just an illustration that i practised double standards on this? Shucks man! Anyhow want to remove service just like this without any amendment from other service? I also know how to propose routes to reduce duplication for sbs 18 and sbs 28. But at that point of time, that was not the crucial issue. </p>
              <p>In all cases, when people want to remove bus services, please take care to substantiate it. Do not do what you do by lumping many unrelated cases and just treat as me having double standards. Go through the specific cases wholeheartedly and re-read through the scenarios at that specified point of time which leads to those accusations.</p>
              <p>I have always understood you as a person whose points for buses and routes and loadings are well thought of and reasonable and very knowledgeable. However, after this incident which i never do anything to provoke you, i begin to think otherwise. I rest my case. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, i also know how to propose route amendments to benefit commuters. At that point of time, this is not the crux of the issue. The issue is people attempting to suggest remove service completely without providing alternative for bedok north ave 2. Do not attempt to link 2 separate issues together. See my other mail.
