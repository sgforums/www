              <p>I have checked the bus arrival times for bus service 106, at around 8:30pm.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>In the direction towards Shenton Way, the bus waiting time is around 5 to 15 minutes, until Napier Road where waiting times exceed 15 minutes.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>In the direction towards Bukit Batok, the bus waiting time is around 3 to 34 minutes.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>By right, the frequency at this hour should be 10-11 minutes (to Shenton Way) and 10-13 minutes (to Bukit Batok).</p>
                                      
                                      <p>I guess there are three reasons why the actual frequency is lower.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Firstly, there may be a traffic jam at Orchard area.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Secondly, there may be a bus on service 106 that was taken out of service.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Thirdly, Tower Transit may not have spare buses to introduce along the route or replace withdrawn buses, yet.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>Well, today is only the first day. I believe Tower Transit will improve their bus services, as they gain more experience and receive more buses from the LTA.</p>

              <p>So is it safe to say that service has gotten worse or is the LTA app just wonky? Because I just checked some TT services (106, 173 &amp; 77) and frequency is akin to buses in Malaysia. </p>

                              <p>Whereas for 106's case of traffic jam at Orchard area, why they never do impromptu route change to skip the congested area?</p>
                              
                      <p>Maybe it's because today's their first day, that's why they haven't started these practices yet, or even introduce fresh buses along the route like how SBS and SMRT do.</p>

              <p>That depends on whether you agree with their practices and policies. That is not for me to comment.</p>
              <p>All I am saying is that they take a very different approach to running bus services as compared to our two incumbent bus operators.</p>

              <p>All i can say that most UK drivers must gone through traffic police profiency test before they were allowed to drive service bus after they complete their trainings.London got a lot of narrow roads and cyclists,So from there you can roughly gauge how good is their driving skills.UK bus drivers focus more on road and passenger safety than runtime.</p>

              <p>I have checked the bus arrival times for bus service 106, at
                  around 8:30pm.</p>
              <p>In the direction towards Shenton Way, the bus waiting time is
                  around 5 to 15 minutes, until Napier Road where waiting times
                  exceed 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>In the direction towards Bukit Batok, the bus waiting time is
                  around 3 to 34 minutes.</p>
              <p>By right, the frequency at this hour should be 10-11 minutes (to
                  Shenton Way) and 10-13 minutes (to Bukit Batok).</p>
              <p>I guess there are three reasons why the actual frequency is
                  lower.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there may be a traffic jam at Orchard area.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there may be a bus on service 106 that was taken out
                  of service.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Tower Transit may not have spare buses to introduce
                  along the route or replace withdrawn buses, yet.</p>
              <p>Well, today is only the first day. I believe Tower Transit will
                  improve their bus services, as they gain more experience and
                  receive more buses from the LTA.</p>

              <p>When I observed in the afternoon, the departure frequency was about 12 mins from Bukit Batok interchange, though some buses departed a little later due to some difficulties (IDFC system/EZ-link card readers, EDS etc) encountered when starting service. I was onboard SG5017H (106) which departed a little later due to the BC not being familiar with how to change the direction of the EDS, but he drove at an average speed and along the way SG5026G caught up with it. The BC then started driving faster (I believe SG5026G slowed down as it wasn't in sight after that and the interval increased to around 4 mins). Later it caught up to SG5003Y, and the BC started driving very slowly. Overall the problem seems to be caused by how the BCs pace themselves along the way, instead of following their schedule they seem to just average themselves inbetween the front and back bus (perhaps they are not allowed to overtake the front bus?).</p>
