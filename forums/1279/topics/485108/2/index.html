              <p>I would suggest that u go read the press release again. N at the
              same time go look at the individual capacity of each bus depot
              before commenting.   N did u take into consideration of those
              dual depot service ? So sv7 will be operated maybe by sbst from
              bndep n maybe smrt from bbdep??? If not all services will switch to
              single depot instead??? </p>

              <p>actually, I am also wondering this. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">like how will the bus operator run bus service 174 (from Boon Lay to Outram Park) if the buses are supplied from only one depot?</span></p>
              <p>well, I am sorry for missing out the part of the press release which mentioned " the Government will own all bus infrastructure such as depots" (<a title="3rd paragraph" href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=28fca09a-bed6-48f4-99d4-18eeb8c496bd">3rd paragraph</a>).</p>
              <p>I think we can only wait until next week when LTA announce more details (CNA just now say that LTA will announce details on the 3 packages next week) , then we will have a clearer understanding on how the bus contracts model will be implemented.</p>
              <p>but I think most likely the bus depots will be shared, along with the buses, among bus companies, which means most likely in the bus depots, certain bus services will be allocated certain spaces in the depot and every depot will be seperated into different parts for bus companies to book and use, based on which bus services they operate. #justsaying </p>

              <p>This raises an interesting point for routes with dual depot deployments. There are three possibilities:</p>
              <p>1. The operator runs only from one depot. This will be inefficient given that there will be a lot of dead milage.</p>
              <p>2. If the contract does not explicity specify that a certain route must be operated out from any specific depot, the operator may choose to operate out of any two depots that it has access to. If the operator loses one of the contract that leads to the loss of one depot, it will revert to (1).</p>
              <p>3. If the packages are put out at the same time, operators may choose to submit a combined bid covering more than one package that involves dual depot deployments and lists out the possible cost savings. If LTA accepts the proposal, the operator operates the contracts together under that agreed arrangement.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>If the route is too large for a single operator to manage, there is always the option of having two or more operators (from their respective packages). This is practised in Perth and Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>even though it is open up for contracts model tendering, I think the government will definitely reserve around one or two packages for the incumbents, since they are local bus operators. I think they will ensure that while there is competition, the competition will not kill any of the incumbents. just make sure that the incumbents do not get "freehold lease" on any package and that they will kinda (somehow) rotate around the island once every five years. #justsaying</p>

              <p>For bus enthuasists, this is effectively GAME OVER. This is

                  buy Volvo buses with Volgren bodywork exclusively for a decade

              <p>I don't think LTA will secured a single contract from a single bulider or supplier for long term as other dealers will file complain to WTO or worse LTA purchasing department kelonging. remember the npark bicycles case? perth is local government that purchase the buses for operators not the centre government. Singapore is different from them. From What i see more or less the buses model will come from 3 or 5          main suppliers like now. </p>

              <p>I don't think LTA will secured a single contract from a single

              <p>Nobody mentioned anything about single contract.</p>
              <p>But for sure fleet homogenization will be the way forward.</p>
              <p>One simple reason is that the IBMS has to be catered for each specific models, and the last thing you want would be to have the odd buses here and there.</p>
              <p>The even simpler reason is that it so much easier to manage when the fleet is homogenized.</p>
              <p>Certainly the days of demo-ing may now be over.</p>

              <p>As I mentioned previously, Aljunied GRC, Hougang SMC and Punggol East SMC are the opposition candidates commonly and collectively owned from the GE2011, BE2012 and BE2013.</p>
                  
                  <p>I guess the various constituencies that are going to lose (Pioneer, Potong Pasir, Hougang, East Coast, Nee Soon, Moulmein-Kallang and West Coast) are their first ones to get contracted out into opposition parties.

              <p>Transport for London does <em>not </em>own the buses, the operators in London do. A possible alternative is for operators to lease the fleet from a private company (as what UK rail operators and even <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/amedeo-to-grow-a380-portfolio-and-become-types-primary-399443/">Singapore Airlines</a> is doing).</p>
              <p>This is the main difference between the London system and LTA's proposal.</p>
              <p>That is why LTA's proposal is closer to the Transperth model.</p>
