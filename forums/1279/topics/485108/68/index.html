              <p>I guess the following bus routes may be in the Ulu Pandan package:</p>
                              
                  <p>Jurong East - 51, 52, 105, 197, 506.</p>
                  <p>Clementi - 7, 14, 99, 147, 156, 165, 166, 175, 196.</p>
                  <p>Ghim Moh - 92, 100, 111</p>
                                  
                                  <p>In total, there are 17 bus routes.</p> 
                                  <p>Currently, these routes use up to 397 buses.</p>
                  <p>In GCM, they will use 455 buses.</p>
                  <p>There will be spare capacity for 45 buses (39 buses in today's context), which means there can be around 4-8 new bus routes in future. This should be enough for future developments in Jurong East, Clementi and West Coast.</p>

              <p>Costs in this industry is soaring (especially labour). Even if they did, they will aim to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/25/spending-review-transport-deepest-budget-cut">reduce their subsidy</a> on bus services once cost savings are realized (and use it to fix the MRT, for example).</p>

              <p>GCM operators do not care. They receive a fixed basic sum. It does not finanically matter whether they pick up an extra passenger or not (this is also the same model for Transperth until very recently).</p>

              <p>the cost will have to bear by someone... either all the paxes, or all the taxpayers...</p>
              <p>total revenue from bus operations is around S$1 billion per year,<br>estimated cost of GCM = S$100m x 12 packages = S$1.2 billion (this is just cost that pay to the operators),excluding cost of buying buses/building of depots etc.. so basically LTA will be losing money... </p>
