              Transit hold Morley and take back Wanneroo, Swan Transit to get

              <p>One of the more recent Transperth bus contracts included a clause on patronage, which I think LTA should consider including.</p>
              <p>PTA would pay out an extra fixed amount per passenger (probably a few cents) the operator has transported on their buses in every trip.</p>
              <p>In a way, this discourages drivers from skipping bus stops (especially for Circle Route and 950 where there is more than one operator).</p>

              <p>When bus services are taken by government, I am sure if service
              27 drivers continue this attitude, they will be punished. At
              Hougang Interchange, I saw a service 27 bus SBS8721B departing.
              Just a minute later, another service 27 bus (SBS6727Z) departing,
              when it is supposed to depart 5 minutes later. This caused the two
              buses to bunch up at Sengkang East Avenue towards Changi Airport,
              less than 2 kilometres into the route. I guess the 2 buses
              travelled together most of the route. What kind of attitude is
              this?</p>

              <p>well, there is a possibility that the one or a few new operators will come from neighbouring countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, etc.</p>
              <p>benefits of having new operators from neighbouring countries:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">they are familiar with our climate and weather. hence they</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> should know very well how to maintain the equipments and infrastructure. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br></span></li>
              <li>we are similar to them and they are similar to us. hence they should be more able to ensure good communication across operations and coordinate things better.</li>

              <p>ASIG don't own any aircraft hangers in Changi, so how do they do "engineerings" [sic]?</p>
              <p>And aircraft refueling and washing are just part of normal ground handling activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point i'm trying to bring across is that it does not mean European/Australian companies will run operations better in our local context. Swissport is by far the largest ground handling company with operations at over 260 airports worldwide, yet they managed to leave SG with a 50 mil loss in 4 years.</p>
              <p>What matters is how familar a company is with the type of operations performed (be it ground handling or bus service, or even taxi services) and how closely it relates to the needs in SG.</p>
              <p>How many bus companies in the world are familar with operating bus routes with over 30 bus stops, and each within 400m, within such a densely built city, and with such high passenger turnover within 1 trip? Almost none I would say (apart from maybe Taiwan), even KMB dont have stops that close together and few routes in hk have so many stops!</p>

              <p>The point i'm trying to bring across is that it does not mean

              company with operations at over 260 airports worldwide, yet they
              managed to leave SG with a 50 mil loss in 4 years.</p>
              <p>What matters is how familar a company is with the type of
              operations performed (be it ground handling or bus service, or even
              taxi services) and how closely it relates to the needs in SG.</p>
              <p>How many bus companies in the world are familar with operating
              bus routes with over 30 bus stops, and each within 400m, within
              such a densely built city, and with such high passenger turnover
              within 1 trip? Almost none I would say (apart from maybe Taiwan),
              even KMB dont have stops that close together and few routes in hk
              have so many stops!</p>

              <p>Arriva could be a possible competitor for the routes, considering they have operations all around the world especially across most of europe. Their most similar operations would be with Arriva London. However, i am still not very confident with their overseas contracts, especially after their recent withdrawl from Malta (and the vehicles they bought for the contract).</p>
              <p>Don't have any experience with Transdev buses, so i cant comment on this.</p>
              <p>The unfortunate thing is many european companies have previously withdrawn/divested their bus operations in east asia (e.g. First from NWFB, Stagecoach from Citybus, Veolia/RATP from Reolian), and I am uncertain if they will bring about success here.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know if any bus operations in east asia is still being operated/jointly operated by european bus co?</p>

              I know that cause currently i drive SATS airport buses too..and Dnata is under Emirates.What i meant why SATS use the engineering title?Probably now they also have pushback,lavatory,Aircon &amp; electrical supply?
              By the way one factor euro co cant have much sucess here probably due to connections..Its not who you are but whom you known.Temasek got stakes in both Sats and Dnata thus their survival..and Dnata Sg is former PSA found CIAS

              <p>The average cost of each bus the government is prepared to buy works out to be $350,000 to $500,000. Given the recent purchases by the two operators including BSEP, the bus models are likely to be limited to:</p>

              <li>Volvo B9TL (Wrightbus)</li>
              <li>Mercedes-Benz Citaro</li>

              </ul>
              <p>and their successor models after 2017 which are not expected to deviate significantly from the current fleet above.</p>
              <p>The other two possible models are:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Scania K250UB (provided that LTA acquires the existing K230UB fleet)</li>

              I hope to see K250 in WA as well. They'd look great with the Optimus body. Hope they replace the O405NH (1140-1230, 1300-62, 1501-90, 1700-70, 1820-53).
