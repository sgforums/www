              to standardise seat covers since all using vogelsitze the system

              <p>The Citaros have proven that you don't need to have the same seat to standardise seat covers. The earliest opportunity I can see LTA doing any sort of standarising of interior fittings will be during a mid life refurbishment, usually after around 10 years of service. They can choose not to do so if they don't think its worth it.</p>

              <p>thanks. i forgot the citaro diff seat but common seat cover with the wrights. yeah MLR is a possibility for changing the covers. but thing is those other parts, sometimes got influence by company colors, like how the wright and citaro grabpoles is purple and seats is reddish. i rmb someone said b4 that it sortof reflects company colors, so will it be awkward lol if LTA buys new GCM wrights that go straight to say TT then interior is very sbs spec</p>

              <p>The grabpoles are painted/stickered over, so they can remove the colours if they want to. Seat covers can be changed easily too, if they want to prevent wastage they can remove and return the seat covers to SBST/SMRT and LTA could then get a new set of seat covers for the GCM buses.</p>

              <p>Interior colour scheme may not matter as much.  Easier to get away with, say, one company operating a bus with another's colours.  For livery, also it's pretty clear-cut since it can only go 3 ways:</p>
              <p>1) Two existing incumbent liveries retained.  Tower Transit takes in SBS-spec buses in SBS livery with TT logo and etc for SMRT.</p>
              <p>2) Common livery with only logos to differentiate.</p>
              <p>3) SBS, SMRT and TT each own livery, meaning that there will be repainting/restickering when buses are transferred.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Why not just continue to use SBS Transit livery  (and SMRT livery for Enviro500 and MAN A22 and their Citaro), except with the LTA logo and the new operator logo?</p>
                              <p>Next time, when new buses come in, just use the same SBS Transit livery and colour scheme. Settle. :)</p>
                              <p>After all, this is just the appearance; Not important. What matters is the standard and quality of the bus service.</p>

              <p>Easier to speculate on matters like appearance mah...  lol.</p>
              <p>So what you are going for is basically Option 1, then.  But in the long term it doesn't work really, imagine if you have 4 foreign operators all using buses with the liveries of 2 companies, who may or may not even win any tender in the hypothetical situation...  </p>
              <p>I'd imagine that some may be unhappy that SBS and SMRT get more 'exposure' so to speak in terms of livery.</p>

              <p>Actually, SBS and SMRT both used the same livery previously before they use the livery they are using now. </p>
                                              <p>White-top and Red-bottom.</p>
                                              <p>Maybe we can revert to this and use this as the common livery.</p>
                                          <p>To think about it, besides Singapore, which country has used before (or is using) this livery, where the top is white and bottom is red?</p>
                                  <p>I know have la... a simple Google search can find so many buses in red-white livery. But, which other company actually use (used) mostly white and only have a red colour stripe at the bottom?</p>
                  
                  <p>This is probably something which I think only Singapore can relate to.</p>
                  
                  <p>If want, we can add a black colour stripe at the bottom like SMRT livery, and some double red colour lines below the window like SBS livery.</p>
                  <p>a uniquely Singapore livery. :)</p>

              <p>Yes, I think bus companies operating the bus services in the GCM
              (Government Contracting Model) are allowed to use the BSEP (Bus
              Services Enhancement Programme) buses to generate advertising
              revenue. If I remember correctly, they are also allowed to
              advertise a larger portion of the bus than what is allowed in the
              current model.</p>

              <p>Actually, SBS and SMRT both used the same livery previously

              <p>Maybe we can revert to this and use this as the common

              <p>To think about it, besides Singapore, which country has used
              before (or is using) this livery, where the top is white and bottom
              is red?</p>
              <p>I know have la... a simple Google search can find so many buses
              in red-white livery. But, which other company actually use (used)
              mostly white and only have a red colour stripe at the bottom?</p>
              <p>This is probably something which I think only Singapore can
              relate to.</p>
              <p>If want, we can add a black colour stripe at the bottom like
              SMRT livery, and some double red colour lines below the window like
              SBS livery.</p>

              <p>It is true, especially for what they call Cross-Harbour routes.  Since the bus companies are based in either Hong Kong Island's side or Kowloon's side, the routes that cross the harbour are often operated jointly by both sides' bus companies.  For example Citybus on the HK side and KMB on the Kowloon side, Citybus has routes in Kowloon and KMB has some routes in HK, but for routes such as 619, they operate the route together.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't recommend it for Singapore.  It is too complex and too much stuffs to handle, especially when they hand over the packages to different operators at the end of the contract.  Allocation of resources and revenue sharing are some problems but not the only problems.  There will be problems with dispatch timings, but at least not as bad as Hong Kong since we are under GCM.  In Hong Kong, they worry about things like their version of iris will not work well with 2 different companies' buses.  Here, we do not need to worry since stop arrival times are synced with LTA.  Still, I think joint operation is too much for us to handle just yet.</p>

              <p>It occurs to me that dead mileage might not be such a big problem to PTOs after all (although right now the number of services with that problem is not that many, some examples include services 13, 48 and 969).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am quite sure that the cost of dead mileage is a factor that must be taken into account in all bids under GCM.</p>

              <p>The much-anticipated common livery will be unveiled in the "A Bulim Carnival Day" event to be organised by the Tower Transit on Sunday, Dec 6, 2015, 10:00 am to 04:00 pm, at the Bulim Bus Depot.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if it's only to see the common livery, do not bother going. It's probably going to be shared on leading websites and Facebook pages about bus services anyway. So what for waste time go there?</p>
              <p>By the way, "Bus Wrap" means bus advertisement. Do not be fooled by the word. It's only the advertisement, not the livery.</p>
