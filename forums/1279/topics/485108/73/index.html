                                                          <p>as third-party apps like uber and grab taxi emerge, more and more people are becoming taxi drivers. But the demand for taxi services is only so much... I do not think we actually need so many taxi drivers.</p>

                                                          <p>if bus and taxi salary is about the same, then taxi drivers would have a choice on whether to drive taxi or drive bus. Then they can have some income secrurity, and we can also have more local bus drivers; win-win. :)</p>
                                              <p>as for the concern on whether the bus operators are able to sustain the higher salaries, well, I believe when they decide on the salary, they would do some kind of financial analysis.</p>
                                          <p>Tower Transit can pay so high probably because they do not have shareholders to pay. Whereas for SBS Transit, I guess it is because they are making huge profits every year, and they feel that they can afford to pay more, that's why they increase their pay.</p>

              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) who join SBS Transit as Bus Captains can draw a monthly gross salary of about $3,460, which represents an increase of more than 15%. They will also receive a sign-on bonus of $3,000.</p>
              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">The revised salary package, which is the result of close consultations and negotiations with the National Transport Workers Union (NTWU), is covered under the SBS Transit - NTWU Collective Agreement. It benefits close to 10,000 SBS Transit employees, of which 6,500 are bus captains.</p>

              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;"><span style="color: #665a4a;">Under the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF), which involves 25 bus services on trial until August 2016, Bus Captains receive an incentive if they achieve the set targets. </span><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">With bus services coming under the new Bus Contracting Model starting September 2016, the reliability incentive will eventually be extended to all Bus Captains.</span></strong><span style="color: #665a4a;"> In addition, the amounts for performance, productivity and safety incentives will also be adjusted upwards.</span></p>

              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">With overtime, adjustments in salary and incentives and the new reliability incentive, new local hires can earn a gross salary of about $3,460 a month in their first year of employment with SBS Transit. The salary package will come with new and enhanced benefits. These include two weeks of paid paternity leave, free travel on all train and basic bus services, free annual health screening and the roll-out of a new flexible benefits scheme with an annual credit value of $500.</p>

With structured training programmes to develop the professionalism and competency of our Bus Captains, we also offer attractive career progression opportunities where they can move up to executive and managerial positions in Operations, Management and Training. In all, we have put together a package that offers an attractive career in the Bus industry."</p>

              <p>In my opinion, I feel that the bus depots owned by SBS Transit and SMRT may serve as "interim depots" before the new bus depots are ready.</p>
                                              
                                              <p>There may be a re-shuffle of bus routes across depots, as routes are grouped into packages. In the process, some routes may change operator.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>By the end of this year, we may know how all the bus routes are packaged.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>As for the buses, I foresee that the Volvo B9TL Wrights, Mercedes Citaros, MAN A22s, MAN DDs and ADL Enviro500s purchased by SBS Transit and SMRT will eventually be purchased by LTA. By then, the netbook value will be lower, so it's cheaper. :)</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Meanwhile, I foresee that the Scania K230UBs and Mercedes OC500LEs will be used until they reached their maximum lifespan, because their lifespan expire around year 2024-2027. By then, all the new depots would be ready. So, it's either an early retirement or just nice de-register when the lifespan is up.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Anyway, it's good that they are implementing the Bus Contracting Model on all bus routes now. Otherwise, by when are they going to implement everything sia?</p>
                      
                      <p>So, yea... :)</p>

              <p>I don't understand why the same bus lobbyists who actively voted and supported for TT green livery previously would then go on to whine and complain about it now when it turns out that it will be applied to all public buses!</p>

              <p>Maybe the balance of J East service,Majority of Clementi,Kent Ridge and Buona Vista too,Who knows after stringent rules set up by LTA SMRT maintenance and operation will improve after losing Bt Batok and Yishun.After the Sungei Seletar package the remaining package will be run by the two incumbents on nego terms until 2022.</p>

              <p>Actually its good when complains like this goes to LTA,They can slightly ask the operators to reduce the runtime and possibly tune the bus pick up to a certain satisfactory level.If you compare SMRT SMB Citaros and SG Citaros acceleration its a world apart..Imagine with full loadings.</p>
