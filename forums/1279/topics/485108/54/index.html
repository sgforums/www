              <p>I think if Sg Selatar package is to include majority Yishun services, it might be awarded to SMRT because they are the only Bendy operator in Singapore. Besides, if SMRT loses yishun, its share in the bus industry will become alot smaller so I dont think LTA will do it.</p>
              <p>Thats why I believe that Sg Seletar Package may contain AMK, YCK and Sengkang instead of Yishun. Some of the Yishun Services that are SD or SD/DD only may be included but the feeders will be probably left out due to the Bendy buses. Unless Bendys are included in that package.</p>

              <p>As the new year arrives, there is still a lot of optimistic selling 
              about the GCM. Those who buy the marketing that GCM necessarily brings a 
              guaranteed improvement in services and fail to moderate their 
              expectations may be in for a rude shock once reality sets in.</p>
              <p>1. 
              Go-Ahead intends to bring the concept of timed stops from London to Singapore. 
              Tower Transit may also follow, as Swan Transit (Tower Transit Perth) 
              already practices this in Australia for several years.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/london-bus-quality-systems-en-route-here">http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/london-bus-quality-systems-en-route-here</a></p>
              <p>How is this different from the current operators?</p>
              <p>Bus
               drivers will no longer attempt to regulate their speed while the bus is
               in motion. Instead, the bus will park at a designated bus stop and wait
               out any excess time in the timetable. For example, if a route 66 bus is
               early for 8 minutes along Bukit Timah, it will stop and park at Little 
              India bus stop for 8 minutes before continuing its journey.</p>
              <p>2. Another practice in London (and many parts of the world) is ad hoc early termination of service. This is<a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/the_rules_of_terminating_buses_e"> legal in London</a>. This is not the same as a shortworking service, where advance warning has already been given.</p>
              <p>If
               the bus is excessively late, the OCC may call the driver and ask him to
               end the bus service early (likely a shortworking point), get all 
              passengers already on the bus to alight and take the next bus.</p>
              <p>This
               can happen especially if three or more buses are bunching together. It is immaterial if that particular bus has previously advertised on its 
              EDS to be operating the full journey.</p>

              <p>It is not known if either operators intend to implement this second practice in Singapore.</p>
              <p>If you are used to these Western practices, all is good. However if you are one of those confused commuters who asked why LTA is frequently modifying bus stops/services to the point where they do not know where to board or forced to walk the distance...</p>

              <p>These concepts, implemented over the long term, will pan out better than the current system. It is a question of whether commuters/motorists will respond maturely if these changes come.</p>
              <p>These ideally should go and hand in hand with chopping up those long legacy bus routes which not only gives the OCC extra work in controlling the headways, but also runs contrary to the concept of depot-centric packages.</p>
              <p>I am afraid these are painful steps that people may not be willing to take. That being the case, we can just go on the same path with little real improvements.</p>
              <p>As for the ad-hoc termination of service, that has been done before, but the practice stopped because commuters didn't like it (obviously). This probably epitomises yet again the painful steps we need to take if we really want to improve reliability.</p>
              <p>On the topic of holding buses at bus-stops, the infrastructural issue will bite: can the bus-stop bay hold buses without disrupting traffic? If this proves otherwise, LTA may not allow it, or I would guess that the incumbents may lobby against it as it affects their operations.</p>

              <p>"Improvements" can be quite a subjective matter to everyone. Let me explain why.</p>
              <p>How is the man on the street going to respond is where I am concerned. There are some pioneer generation people I spoke to who greatly resent changes because these changes inconvenience them - even moving a bus stop 100 away from the previous one (e.g. 920/922/979 at Bukit Panjang MRT Station). Some have weak legs, others less willing to make personal sacrifices. One elderly lady I spoke to asked "why bring in all 
                                      these fancy foreign practices with little consideration of local needs/culture for an old lady".</p>
              <p>There are then those who will ignore large banners and signs telling them this bus stop is for alighting only and still question the driver why they wouldn't allow them to board. The only but major flaw with these signs is that they were all in English. Some follow the crowd with a herd menality and groan when the driver refuses boarding at the bus stop. Others criticise why the boarding and alighting points are arranged in such a confusing manner.</p>
              <p>I think the negative response will come largely from the commuters than the incumbent operators. Not everyone in Singapore understands English, and even if they do, appreciate all these concepts. New GCM practices, if not explained properly, can result in irate commuters who do not appreciate them. Passengers who frequently get kicked off a late bus without explanation may interpret it as buses "frequently break down much more often than before the GCM". Timed stops makes regulating services much more visible than current practices, and may cause some passengers to think that "GCM is causing me to be late and buses to be slower than before".</p>
              <p>These are some of the challenges LTA and the new operators will have to anticipate in advance. For timed stops, traffic can be another possible issue and LTA may have to consider building dedicated bays/parking lots to accomodate these buses waiting out their timetable.</p>
