              <p>I do think the current distance-based fare system is unfair towards operators and benefits mainly only commuters. Operators have been losing out. But then again, it seems to fit our highly hub-and-spoke route network...</p>

                                                  <p>$12 for two-way public transport is about the same as the fare for one-way taxi ride. So, it's still cheaper than taxi.</p>

                                                  <p>But, is the general public willing to pay $360 a month for public transport?</p>
                                      <p>The lowest income people earn around $1,200 per month. $360 to them is 30% of their salary. Are they able to afford to pay $360 every month, while pay other things like electricity, water, food, rental, town council charges, etc?</p>
                                      <p>So, we have to be very careful when we increase the fares.</p>
                                      <p> </p>
                                      <p>While the fare revenue should increase to recover the costs for buses, we have to be mindful that not everyone can afford to pay higher fares.</p>
                                      <p>Of course, we can introduce concession pass for the lowest income people, among other measures. Actually, this is what we are doing now.</p>
                                      <p>Personally, I think the current method is the best. We set the fares low so that everyone can afford. At the same time, we set progressive taxes where rich pay more tax and poor pay less tax.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>So, there's nothing much to debate, actually.</p>                       
                          
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>In terms of money, this contracting model offers the best value for money solutions, so we can gain more from the same amount of money. </p>
                          <p>But that's on the costs, not the fare revenue.</p>

              <p>In FY2015,</p>
              <p>SBS Transit bus operations made $645.785 million of fare
                                      revenue. (620.657 card + 25.128 cash)</p>
              <p>SMRT buses made $238.1 million of fare revenue.</p>
              <p>The total fare revenue collected from public bus services was
                                      $883.885 million. (645.785 + 238.1)</p>
              <p>Singapore has around 430 bus routes. So, on average, each bus
                                      route generated around $2.056 million. (883.885 ÷ 430)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tower Transit will get $111.2 million per year to run the 26 bus
                                      routes. (556.0 ÷ 5)</p>
              <p>The 26 bus routes should generate around $53.456 million of
                                      revenue per year, in FY2015 context. (2.056 × 26)</p>
              <p>This translates to around $57.744 million of loss per year, in
                                      FY2015 context. (53.456 - 111.2)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, the fare revenue alone cannot recover the costs.</p>
              <p>If we want to recover costs solely by collecting fare revenue,
                                      fares must increase by around 192.57% (111.2 ÷ 57.744). This means
                                      we have to pay three times the bus fares we are paying now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the problem is that the current fare model is
                                      integrated for bus and train services.</p>
              <p>While our bus services is making losses, our train services is
                                      making profits.</p>
              <p>In FY2015, SBS Transit's train services collected $213.403
                                      million of fare revenue and spent $209.703 million of costs
                                      (213.403 revenue - 3.7 profit).</p>
              <p>Whereas for SMRT, its trains services collected $654 million
                                      (644.2 mrt + 9.8 lrt) of fare revenue and spent $644.4 million of
                                      costs (654 revenue - 13.4 MRT profit + 3.8 LRT loss).</p>
              <p>Total fare revenue collected in FY2015 for train services was
                                      $867.403 million (213.403 sbs + 654 smrt), and total costs spent on
                                      train services was $854.103 million (209.703 sbs + 644.4 smrt); our
                                      train services made a profit of $13.3 million (867.403 revenue -
                                      854.103 cost).</p>
              <p>If we increase the fares by two times just to recover the costs
                                      of our bus services, we will enable our train services to make two
                                      times more profit.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, as distance-based fare system offers the cheapest
                                      fare combination, we have to make do with this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, most of us spend around $4 on public transport per
                                      day.</p>
              <p>If we increase fares by two times, we would spend $12 on public
                                      transport per day; $360 per month (12 × 30).</p>
              <p>$12 for two-way public transport is about the same as the fare
                                      for one-way taxi ride. So, it's still cheaper than taxi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, is the general public willing to pay $360 a month for
                                      public transport?</p>
              <p>The lowest income people earn around $1,200 per month. $360 to
                                      them is 30% of their salary. Are they able to afford to pay $360
                                      every month, while pay other things like electricity, water, food,
                                      rental, town council charges, etc?</p>
              <p>So, we have to be very careful when we increase the fares.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the fare revenue should increase to recover the costs for
                                      buses, we have to be mindful that not everyone can afford to pay
                                      higher fares.</p>
              <p>Of course, we can introduce concession pass for the lowest
                                      income people, among other measures. Actually, this is what we are
                                      doing now.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think the current method is the best. We set the
                                      fares low so that everyone can afford. At the same time, we set
                                      progressive taxes where rich pay more tax and poor pay less
                                      tax.</p>
              <p>So, there's nothing much to debate, actually.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of money, this contracting model offers the best value
                                      for money solutions, so we can gain more from the same amount of
                                      money.</p>
              <p>But that's on the costs, not the fare revenue.</p>

              <p>Under such conditions in other cities, people will buy a car and drive because it is cheaper and faster. Australian operators will tell you to drive anyway if you are not willing to put up with their service (and several cities have adopted the Transperth model).</p>
              <p>But because this is Singapore, taxi and ride sharing will make a roaring business. Their pricing would act as the de facto cap on public transport fares.</p>
              <p>At some point it might be cheaper for a group to take Uber or Grab than to take public transport.</p>
              <p>Adjustment to public transport fares traditionally has a substantial impact on prices of other daily necessities (such as food).</p>

                                  <p>Is it because the gradient at Toh Tuck Road is steep, that's why you do not think DDs can ply Toh Tuck Road?</p>
                                  <p>Actually, I think DDs still can run along Toh Tuck Road. The gradient is about the same as that at Nanyang Drive. If DDs can run along Nanyang Drive, DDs should be able to run along Toh Tuck Road.</p>
                      <p>as for Sixth Avenue, why you say DD cannot? the gradient looks okay what. it's a bit like Jurong West Avenue 4 between Pioneer Road North and JW Street 61/71.</p>

                                  <p>I think it's because of insufficient loading, that's why 77 does not have high capacity buses. 77 is private houses all the way, only at Bukit Batok and Beauty World area then have HDB. most of its target audience do not take public transport. single deckers are good enough.</p>

              <p>Is it because the gradient at Toh Tuck Road is steep, that's why
              you do not think DDs can ply Toh Tuck Road?</p>
              <p>Actually, I think DDs still can run along Toh Tuck Road. The
              gradient is about the same as that at Nanyang Drive. If DDs can run
              along Nanyang Drive, DDs should be able to run along Toh Tuck
              Road.</p>
              <p>as for Sixth Avenue, why you say DD cannot? the gradient looks
              okay what. it's a bit like Jurong West Avenue 4 between Pioneer
              Road North and JW Street 61/71.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it's because of insufficient loading, that's why 77 does
              not have high capacity buses. 77 is private houses all the way,
              only at Bukit Batok and Beauty World area then have HDB. most of
              its target audience do not take public transport. single deckers
              are good enough.</p>
              <p>The "77" in the LTA poster is probably just an illustration.</p>
