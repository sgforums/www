              <p>Remember purchase and ownership of buses under the London contracting system falls under the operators, not Transport for London. There are many mid-life buses that are cascaded to other regions within by operators the UK when the contract is lost or requirements change during renewal.

              <p>Transdev Melbourne had to bear the legacy of previous operators' choice of fleet purchasing when they took over 500 buses, consisting of no less than 25 different bus models!</p>
              <p>Dealing with so many different models is going to be a nightmare to whoever is in charge of maintenance, and drive up costs (which this government is seeking to reduce under the competitive tender model). Training is going to be a major issue as well.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To save training costs for the subsequent bus companies, I think LTA should ask SBS Transit and SMRT to ownself assign their respective bus drivers and technicians to only one particular bus model and give LTA a list of names to use to re-assign bus drivers and technicians to if their bus model has been re-assigned to other bus services, so that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">whoever is driving and maintaining whatever bus model now will continue to drive and maintain the same bus model that he is driving or maintaining</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>To make things simple, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I believe the existing buses being used now would remain in their respective bus services and even if not, the buses would be re-deployed to other bus services within the same package area</span></strong>. Likewise, the bus drivers driving and the technicians maintaining the affected buses would also be re-deployed. Being in the same package area would enable the bus driver and technician to keep their job as they would not be geographically inmobile to their workplace (which is usually in the same area as where they stay), while allow the bus company to save on training costs, as the existing buses would be driven by the same bus drivers that are driving them now and be maintained by the same technicians.</p>
              <p>With this, training is only required for the usual groups:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>new bus drivers and technicans.</li>
              <li>drivers selected to drive and technicians selected to maintain new bus models.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>While this would enable the new bus company to save on the training costs, it would also shorten the transition process to new bus operator, thus benefit the commuters.</p>
              <p>Of course, if halfway through the contract period LTA replaces existing bus models with new bus models, whichever company that has the contract would have to train the bus drivers and technicians to drive/maintain them.</p>

              <p>Under the new centralised ownership of assets by the government, 
                      would the government be responsible for the maintenance of the bus

              <p>I do believe a way of making operators more efficient is to allow them to buy their own buses, based on what they think is best for them, and not create inefficiencies through bad purchasing decisions, unlike western countries, the fares here are very cheap, any bad fleet decisions by a agency which knows nothing about fleet management can mean a more than proportionate increase in public spending on transport, which is not what any government wants.</p>
              <p>Cue: O.500LE CNGs when the Transperth contrct was held by Mercedes Benz, and they can't back out in just a short time as that contract was valid for a number of years.</p>

              <p>I do believe a way of making operators more efficient is to

                                                              in public spending on transport, which is not what any government

                                                              contract was valid for a number of years.</p>

              <p>Even so, a different set of issues can arise from operator made fleet decisions. I think it is almost certain LTA will have the final say in fleet decisions.</p>
              <p>a) How can one be so sure that an operator, especially foreign,
                                                              will get it right the first time? What if they decide to get new
                                                              buses in small quantities during the term of their contract?
                                                              Operators can still make bad fleet purchase decisions, particularly
                                                              if the new foreign player has little experience in understanding
                                                              the dynamics of Singapore's public transport.</p>
              <p>If bad fleet decisions were made by the operator, LTA ultimately
                                                              is the one stuck with these buses. Either the next operator will
                                                              inherit the problem (or colourful) fleet the previous operator has
                                                              left behind resulting in continued inefficiency, or LTA has to
                                                              clean up the mess.</p>
              <p>b) If LTA (and consequently, the taxpayers) foots the initial
                                                              bill and tells the operator they can buy any bus they want, the
                                                              operator is certain to buy the latest and most expensive buses from
                                                              the market to impress (well they aren't paying anyway, why not?).
                                                              The public already isn't very happy with the fact that they will be
                                                              paying for future new buses, and they last thing they want is to
                                                              pay more out of their own pocket.</p>
              <p>c) Alternatively the operator could undercut and propose to buy
                                                              lower quality buses, knowing that they would be out in five years
                                                              (or earlier if they go bust, look at a few MRT contractors). At the
                                                              end of the contract, LTA ends up getting stuck with these
                                                              substandard buses and eventually has to dispose of them. Furthermore, what if the operator operating a unique fleet suddenly went out of business and someone else has to take over on short notice? Remember that after the SMRT China driver strike, SBS Transit BCs had to be re-trained to drive on SMRT's bus fleet and that takes time.</p>
              <p>LTA is the one who will face the long-term consequences of any
                                                              fleet purchase. Therefore, they need to have a decent knowledge on
                                                              bus procurement regardless whether the LTA or the operator is doing
                                                              the choosing. If there is anyone who can stop the operator from choosing something stupid or impractical, it would be LTA. Remember
                                                              the contract lasts for five to seven years, but the buses need to
                                                              last for at least 17 years.</p>
              <p>To prevent the above scenarios from happening, I would think LTA
                                                              would want to have the final say over fleet procurement and I
                                                              believe that they will be take a rather conservative approach,
                                                              looking at BSEP so far.</p>
              <p>As for long-term contracts, I made it clear that it is an *if*
                                                              situation in my first reply and it is up for debate.</p>

              <p>To save training costs for the subsequent bus companies, I
              think LTA should ask SBS Transit and SMRT to ownself assign their
              respective bus drivers and technicians to only one particular
              bus model and give LTA a list of names to use to
              re-assign bus drivers and technicians to if their bus model has
              been re-assigned to other bus services, so that
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">whoever is
              driving and maintaining whatever bus model now will continue
              to drive and maintain the same bus model that he is driving or
              maintaining</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>To make things simple, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I believe the existing buses being
              used now would remain in their respective bus services and even if
              not, the buses would be re-deployed to other bus services within
              the same package area</span></strong>. Likewise, the bus drivers
              driving and the technicians maintaining the affected buses would
              also be re-deployed. Being in the same package area would enable
              the bus driver and technician to keep their job as they would
              not be geographically inmobile to their workplace (which is usually
              in the same area as where they stay), while allow the bus company
              to save on training costs, as the existing buses would be driven by
              the same bus drivers that are driving them now and be
              maintained by the same technicians.</p>
              <p>With this, training is only required for the usual groups:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>new bus drivers and technicans.</li>
              <li>drivers selected to drive and technicians selected to maintain
              new bus models.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>While this would enable the new bus company to save on the
              training costs, it would also shorten the transition process to new
              bus operator, thus benefit the commuters.</p>
              <p>Of course, if halfway through the contract period LTA replaces
              existing bus models with new bus models, whichever company that has
              the contract would have to train the bus drivers and technicians to
              drive/maintain them.</p>

              <p>I think Volvo has a high chance of securing the contract for new buses in the future. This is because currently Volvo has all 3 types of buses in the market, the B9L, B9LA and the B9TL and all of them uses the D9B engine. This would make training and maintenance much easier for LTA as well as the operators. Not to mention that LTA would also inherit a large fleet of Volvo buses from SBS Transit, so it would make sense that Volvo will be chosen.</p>
              <p>Scania might have a chance too, if they continue producing KUD buses. If I'm not wrong I read somewhere that Scania has stopped producing KUD buses since the demand isn't very high?</p>
              <p>MAN and Mercedes-Benz will have a small chance if they can produce a 12m dd unit within this 2 years and gain enough trust from the SG and HK operators.</p>
              <p>ADL has a chance too if LTA does not want to buy articulated buses anymore. The Enviro 500 will have to prove itself during these 2 years.</p>
              <p>I am also not ruling out the possibly that the other manufacturers (such as Iveco/Irisbus, VDL as well as the China manufacturers) would also want to supply public buses.</p>

              <p>I do believe a way of making operators more efficient is to
                  allow them to buy their own buses, based on what they think is best
                  for them, and not create inefficiencies through bad purchasing
                  decisions, unlike western countries, the fares here are very cheap,
                  any bad fleet decisions by a agency which knows nothing about
                  fleet management can mean a more than proportionate increase
                  in public spending on transport, which is not what any government
                  wants.</p>
              <p>Cue: O.500LE CNGs when the Transperth contrct was held by
                  Mercedes Benz, and they can't back out in just a short time as that
                  contract was valid for a number of years.</p>

              <p>Frankly I think you just can't bear to let go of the thought of having a homogenized fleet purchased by govt (read not single-type fleet).</p>
              <p>1. Like I have already mentioned before, the IBMS is not something you can just stick onto a bus. If you have 3 types of buses, you will have to have 3 kits to deck the bus out. If you have 20 buses......well, too bad, 20 kits then. The contractor will charge LTA more for that. </p>
              <p>2. Trying to purchase different buses for this and that was never the style of the govt. In any case, a "one-size-fits-all" approach does have advantages as well. See point 1 for an example.</p>
              <p>3. The mantra of the competive tendering approach as applied here involves "leveling the playing field". Which was the driving force behind point 1 as well. If buses are to be leased out to market players as in this case, having a homogenized fleet will serve the cause better.</p>

              LTA would also inherit a large fleet of Volvo buses from SBS

              <p>Scania might have a chance too, if they continue producing KUD

              <p>MAN and Mercedes-Benz will have a small chance if they can
              produce a 12m dd unit within this 2 years and gain enough trust

              <p>ADL has a chance too if LTA does not want to buy articulated

              <p>I am also not ruling out the possibly that the other

              <p>dude, its not that straightfwd as 2601D has mentioned. im not going to go into the mechanics of his argument, but to make the key point - whatever LTA (or whoever else the central procument authority for buses in the future) deems the most "value for money" should be selected for procurement. youre adressing the peripheral points that make up the "value for money" idea behind procurements, which is there but not quite there yet. how you want to interpret "value for money" is your call. </p>
              <p>Onto single source procurement that 2601D mentioned in an earlier reply, it is in some ways ideal givenn commonality in training/spares etc, but its only effective if these maintenance are done in-house rather than at the dealership. before i go on further, its UNLIKELY that any bus company would invest too heavily in inhouse vehicle maintenance, and that gives them alot more flexibility in procurement (considering that investment in maintenance is an investment of sorts). </p>
              <p>as to what LTA would procure after 2016, its pretty much anyones guess, but im looking at least a few of the following points: <br>**cost (the cheaper the better, since buses in the sg context are loss-making)<br>**maintenance package attrativeness (unlikely LTA would maintain the buses inhouse, rather by signing a maintenance package with purchase) <br>**delivery commitments (should be quite self explanatory)<br>**accessibility vs capacity argument (dont forget that LTA did not instill a moratorium on LE or LF ONLY)<br></p>
