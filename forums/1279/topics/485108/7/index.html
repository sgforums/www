              <p>Hi mr pervertedboy, sbs 49 will not be extended to jurong east interchange. Neither will it cover most sections of sbs 143M and sbs 98M. It will also not replace them. To begin with, sbs 49 and sbs 143M serve different routes. So how to replace??? A more probable reason is to have different operators compete against one another. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hope that the government will improve the maintenance of the buses, especially the older buses which tend to require more careful maintenance to run properly. Some aspects I expect to see with this move:</p>
              <p>1. Better maintenence (cleaner interior and interior properly in place)</p>
              <p>2. Better allocation of frequencies (management over the frequency of services, especially those with low (&gt; 15 mins) and high (&lt; 5 mins) frequencies)</p>
              <p>3. Better connections of bus routes (enhancements to current routes to improve connections without the need to introduce new routes and waste resources)</p>

              <p>I refer LTA control the recruitment of drivers will be better, as LTA keep the bus fare, it will be better for LTA to give the driver the salary. I think if LTA can recruit drivers and training them, LTA and NTUC can setup a bus drivers training school, i think it will attact local and malaysia drivers to driver public buses with better pay. and also just in case the contracted company cannot make it there will no stopping of bus operation suddenly. </p>

              <p>you are wrong to think this way. the bus operator tender with fix amount of money to operate the service. if at the end of the day the operator cannot make it , they just lost the contract only. the bus driver should not be worry about lost of jobs. they just driver of the bus which is own by LTA. it nothing to do with the operator competitive. Also it will save time and money for the opeators to look for manpower. how about the present batch of drivers where they go?  I think it better for LTA to employ the drivers. LTA provide the bus and driver. operators just operate the service. If not then make the operator to share a percentage of salary paid to the drivers.</p>

              <p>Wrong.</p>
              <p>Human Resource one of the largest components making up the total costs of operation, and is what makes or breaks an operator. Getting the manpower aspect right also allows the operator to gain a comparative advantage over others.</p>
              <p>Training is one example. A competitive operator can improve the productivity of its drivers by investing into training for drivers to be familiar with more routes. This allows the operator to become flexible with its day-to-day operation and increase its overall efficiency. If LTA has control and decides to redeploy drivers whenever they deem fit, the operator has no incentive to invest in additional training because there is no manpower stability.</p>
              <p>Another example is the policy on rostering and shift hours. SBS Transit and SMRT Buses at one time have very different 
                      policies on the number of shift days and the number of working hours per day (though there is a legal limit defined by MOM). If the drivers have a uniform 
                      contract with LTA then such differences is hardly possible in the 
                      first place.</p>
              <p>Renumeration policies is also a major source of incentive or disincentive for drivers. If LTA has control over renumeration of drivers, then it is very difficult for operators to change the behaviour of drivers through changing the components of monetary compensation (such as safety bonuses, bonus for KPI, skills based allowance, etc.). An attractive renumeration policy will also allow operators to lure prospective drivers away from the private sector, or even rival operators.</p>
