              <p>Hi sgbuses, thanks for sharing with us this valuable information. :)</p>
              <p>In layman terms, the LTA wants to take back the buses bought by the Government for SBS Transit, by 31 December 2015. I believe the same goes for SMRT.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the new buses after 31 December 2015, I think there would be buses taken back by the LTA, as part of the purchase may be funded by the Government.</p>
              <p>Well, that means the initial bus fleet for bus routes in the Government Contracting Model for bus services would consist of the following models:</p>
              <ol> </ol>
              <div>Double-decker buses<br></div>
              <ol> </ol> 
              <ul>
              <li>Volvo B9TL Wright</li>

              </ul>
              <ol> </ol>
              <div>Single-decker buses</div>

              <li>Mercedes-Benz Citaro</li>
              <li>MAN A22</li>

              <p>Would that mean services like 4, 20, 50, 116 will have to be operated by SBS then considering it will give BSEP buses back? In turn, given Jurong East / Clementi will be given to Tower Transit, SBS will have excess of buses as well.</p>
              <p>My challenge is BSEP is more SDs than DDs... while Clementi/Jurong East services are majority DD than SD... how is LTA going to manage this? It has to either make bulk registration of DDs now... or some services will have their capacity downgraded.</p>

              <p>It was mentioned before somewhere in this forum that the LTA would initially use buses with the Emission Standard of Euro 5.</p>
              <p>Euro 5 is on new buses made after October 2008.</p>
              <p>The Volvo B9TL Wrights, Alexander-Dennis Enviro500s, Mercedes-Benz Citaros and MAN A22s deployed on our public bus routes have the Emission Standard of Euro 5.</p>
              <p>Likewise for the Mercedes-Benz OC500LEs and part of the Scania K230UBs that are on our public bus routes.</p>
              <p>I guess the LTA would buy the buses of Euro 5 Emission Standard that were bought by SBS Transit and SMRT. After factoring depreciation, it would cost less than to buy new buses. :)</p>
              <p>Whereas for the buses made before October 2008 (without the Euro 5 Emission Standard), they would be replaced with new buses with Emission Standard of Euro 5 and above.</p>
              <p>Likewise for the MAN A24s, if the LTA does not want to use Articulated buses.</p>
              <p>I do not think there would be re-deployment of buses. Only replacements.</p>
              <p>List of bus models made before October 2008 that will still be in service in 2016:</p>
              <ol>

              <p>If LTA has done its planning, the quantity of buses ordered under BSEP for the two incumbent operators would commensurate at least with the requirements for Bulim parcel tender.</p>
              <p>Also recall that in one business news article, LTA faces a unique problem - they do not wish to unjustifiably give both incumbent operators a windfall by buying up the rest of their older fleet (many of which have already fully deprecated). The most plausible way to accomplish this while maximizing the lifespan of the older buses is to let them run until 2022, and then tender all the remaining parcels.</p>

              <p>Well, of the nine models (or 1457 buses) we have that do not have Emission Standard of Euro 5 and above, seven (or 757 buses) are not wheelchair accessible.</p>
                      <p>The aim is for 100% of public bus services to be wheelchair accessible by year 2020. One year replace around 151.4 non-wheelchair accessible buses. Eventually, all public buses would be wheelchair accessible.</p>
                      <p>Whereas for the buses that are wheelchair accessible, yet have Emission Standard of Euro 4 and below, we can re-deploy them to "special" bus routes.</p>
                   <p>We can use the 500 Scania K230UBs Single-Decker buses for bus routes that connect to Johor Bahru. At least they are wheelchair accessible, and are only one standard (Euro 4) below the Emission Standard (Euro 5) in majority of our public buses by then.</p>
                      <p>The 199 first generation of Volvo B9TL and that 1 Scania K310UD Double-Decker buses can be used for the City-Direct bus services, training of new bus captains, etcetera.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
                  <p>Well, if 276 buses (1358-1082) are replaced in one year, it would take 3.92 years after 2016 to replace the remaining 1082 buses that do not have the Emission Standard of Euro 5 and above; by year 2020, all would be replaced.</p>
                  <p>However, I feel that it would be a waste to replace the Scania K230UB Euro 4 Single-Decker buses and the Volvo B9TL Euro 3 Double-Decker buses. They are still new (since year 2006 and year 2008), and are wheelchair-accessible.</p>

              <p>Either way still have to spend money to buy buses.</p>
              <p>If the LTA does not buy the "used" (Euro 5 and above) buses from SBS Transit and SMRT at a lower price (after factoring depreciation), or at the selling price when bought, it has to spend more money (considering inflation) to buy new buses.</p>
              <p>Unless it is cheaper for the LTA to buy new buses, than to buy from SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>

                                                  <p>I guess the High Capacity buses currently deployed on bus routes in the Bulim and Loyang bus packages are mostly the Volvo B9TL Wrights and the Alexander-Dennis Enviro500s. I think we can focus our resources on replacing the non-Euro5 Double-Decker buses and the (at least the non-Euro5) Articulated buses, so that when the bus packages are implemented, the High Capacity buses would all have the Emission Standard of Euro5.</p>
                                                  <p>Each time focus on one area. Now focus on Bulim and Loyang. Next focus on Mandai and Ulu Pandan. Thereafter, to the subsequent bus packages as they are being implemented.</p>
                                      <p>Actually, if there is a problem, it is with the Single-Decker buses. The ones on SBS Transit bus services are mostly the Scania K230UB, which only around 4/9 are the (Emission Standard) Euro5 edition. For the around 5/9 that are the Euro4 edition, I think we have to exchange with the Euro5 editions from other areas.</p>

It says that the "LTA will negotiate with the incumbents to run the nine packages under the contracting model, for durations of about five years when their BSOL expire on 31 August 2016. After these negotiated contracts expire, more bus services will be gradually tendered out.".</p>
              <p>I guess this means SBS Transit and SMRT would continue to operate the nine remaining packages until around September 2021. By then, the public buses with Emission Standard of Euro 4 and below would probably all be replaced.</p>

              <p>I guess the new buses bought by the LTA would continue to be of the same model as the ones bought by SBS Transit and SMRT, if it is the same type of bus.</p>
              <p>Well, I hope to see new models. If everywhere is only Volvo B9TL Wright (and Alexander-Dennis Enviro500) and Mercedes-Benz Citaro (and MAN A22 and Scania K230UB), it feels very boring.

              <p>Hi sgbuses, thanks for sharing with us this valuable
              information. :)</p>
              <p>In layman terms, the LTA wants to take back the buses bought by
              the Government for SBS Transit, by 31 December 2015. I believe the
              same goes for SMRT.</p>
              <p><strong>Whereas for the new buses after 31 December 2015</strong>, I think there
              would be buses taken back by the LTA, as part of the
              purchase may be funded by the Government.</p>
              <p>Well, that means the initial bus fleet for bus routes in the
              Government Contracting Model for bus services would consist of the
              following models:</p>
              <div>Double-decker buses<br></div>
              <ul>
              <li>Volvo B9TL Wright</li>
              <li>Alexander-Dennis Enviro500</li>
              </ul>
              <div>Single-decker buses</div>
              <ul>
              <li>Mercedes-Benz Citaro</li>
              <li>MAN A22</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>With reference to your third line, LTA is taking back buses up until those registered in June 2015...Those registered after July 2015 is not affected for now. Guess by the time Tower Transit take over those bus services, SBS Transit and SMRT will have already completed replacement for those being taken back...the rotting MANs should be for such purposes.</p>
