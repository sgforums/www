              <p>Hi mr SG5001C, yes you are right. But others are thinking the 12 contracts will be tendered out based on competition right away. Anyway after yr 2022, I believe foreign operators may not be that keen on this tender because they may feel it is not that lucrative as what they have initially thought to be. I foresee some withdrawals by them after yr 2022. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hoping that the next two depots requires considerable time for the transition of the SBS and SMRT's buses to the GCM's Tower Transit and Go-Ahead in 2016, before deciding the probable bids for Seletar and Ulu Pandan. By the time the expanded BSEP will cover the requirements for Sungei Seletar and Ulu Pandan, whereas the other buses in Singapore will still keep under the negotiated SBS and SMRT's schemes.</p>

              <p>if they are going to use the current BSEP buses, it is possible.... cos SBST have only around 667 BSEP buses (based on the press release)... unless they placed new order or bought over more citaros/B9 under the current SBST order...</p>

              <h1 class="news_title">Go-Ahead Group takes over Loyang Bus Depot</h1>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) on 
              Friday (Dec 11) said it has handed over Loyang Bus Depot, located off 
              Loyang Avenue, to UK transport operator Go-Ahead Group.</p>
              <p>According
               to LTA, the handover of the depot enables the operator to prepare for 
              operations, as well as recruit and train bus captains and technicians, 
              to support a smooth transition.</p>
              <p>Developed and funded by the 
              Government, the Loyang Bus Depot is leased to Go-Ahead Group under the 
              bus contracting model. The provision of bus depots, among other bus 
              assets, lowers the entry barriers for new operators, which in turn 
              facilitates greater competition in the public bus industry.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead
               Singapore transition director Nigel Wood said: âThe large, well-located
               depot is ideal for our bus services from Pasir Ris, Punggol, as well as
               Changi, to other locations such as Tampines, Bedok, and Sengkang.</p>
              <p>âWe
               plan to enhance it further with interior refurbishments to create an 
              excellent working environment for our employees, and to equip it to also
               house a recruitment and training centre."</p>
              <p>Loyang Bus Depot, which
               spans 8.3 hectares, can accommodate about 500 buses. Similar to Bulim 
              Bus Depot, it is equipped with facilities for daily bus operations, such
               as refuelling and washing, bus repair and maintenance, and amenities 
              for bus captains to rest or eat.Â </p>
              <p>Go-Ahead buses are a familiar 
              sight on London's roads, as the groupâs fleet of 2,300 buses account for
               about 25 per cent of the capital's bus services.</p>
              <p>Its <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/second-uk-transport/2285760.html">service will be heading to Singapore from September next year </a>on
               several existing and a few new routes, after the Group won a five-year 
              contract last month. The deal will see the Britain-based company 
              operating 25 bus routes in Loyang from the third quarter of 2016. It has
               said it will need 900 employees.</p>
              <p>The company is the second UK transport operator to have won a bus package contract here, after London-basedÂ <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tower-transit-unveils/2254530.html">Tower Transit</a>.</p>

              <p>Cross-boarder Bus Services are harder to manage because it is harder to determine how long it takes for the bus to go over to the other side and come back.</p>
              <p>I guess they will be in the same package? I do not know.</p>
              <p>If cross boarder bus services are also operated in the other countries where bus services are tendered out in contracts, perhaps we may want to learn from them on how they do it.</p>

              <p>That is quite natural if you imagine it. Â We are likely the first city-state, or at least one of the first, to implement a GCM for our bus transport (most city-states have nationalised or private bus systems). Â The models we are basing our system on are those of capital cities, or major cities, in large countries, so it is logical that they have no cross-border services - hence we will be setting the precedent ourselves as to cross-border buses in a GCM, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>correct me if I'm wrong</em></span>. Â I<span style="line-height: 1.231;">f anyone knows of existing GCMs with cross-border services, do let me know! Â I'd be interested to hear about it.</span></p>

              <p>109 go to Loyang GCM just nice. To free up more space at AM (&amp; BNDEP) 21 also should go to LYBP. 136 can remain with the incumbent until the next round of tendering.</p>

              <p>Thanks sgbuses and iveco for the info! The read about route 84 is interesting.</p>
              <p>However, as relevant as they may be, those examples are merely examples of routes which stretch beyond the GCM's territory. Still relevant as a reference ('Ã¥ï¿½âÃ¨â¬Æ') for how to handle a route that extends beyond for longer than most others, but I wonder how LTA is going to handle 160, 170, 950 which require the crossing of an international border. Registration with SPAD/LPKP/whatever they call themselves when the time comes... third brake light... company details...</p>
              <p>I seem to recall that when SBS operated 170 and rebranded to SBST, the perm 170 buses apparently were the last to repaint, due to regulations and approval/permit from LPKP, or whatever they were called then. Not sure if similar reasons caused the SMRT A22s on 950 to be repainted late, although I hear a repainted A22 has made its way onto 950.</p>
              <p>If and when the cross-border services come into GCM, LTA will have to liaise a lot with SPAD, and explain to them the system, I'd imagine...? Or perhaps there's another way? I'd like to hear your thoughts. :)</p>
