              <p><br>No one is saying to remove sv 18 but re-route it to become more useful. You have many alternatives from Blk 302 to SAFRA. You have sv 8/59 with majority DD fleet coming at under 10 minute interval in peak hours. If sv 18 goes st 21 or ave 9, it will still ply this stretch.</p>
              <p>To Tamp Int from Tamp Ave 7 you have so many services - residents here are totally pampered. You have 4, 8, 18, 19, 37, 38, 81 direct to interchange + 21 to Tampines MRT as well. If sv 18 does not ply ave 7, will it really matter? Answer is NO.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, once again please mind your words. I am not spokesperson from LTA or MOT. I do not get a cent from them. Please wake up your idea. How many times must I say? When can this get into your mind? If you want to reply to me, please get your thinking cap on. Supply us with your knowledge instead of all the nonsense accusations earlier on. We are all fellow forumnites on this bus forum. I urge you to show some respect for people. When a person tells you not to link him to LTA and has countless times told you, please respect the person ok? This is basic adult responsibility. Once again, if you continue to do so, shame on you man, mr BusAnalyser!</p>
              <p>I always write to others without provoking people. Most of my mails from the time I come here always have the words 'cheers'. My tone is always very mild to others. Even if you provoke me, I also take it mildly at first. I am afraid I only get this kind of response from you only as seen here. There is no other person. Do not anyhow link when you are the person at fault obviously. Cheers</p>

You need to read my note to you properly. I am telling you that you need to watch the way you speak to others, by telling each person, x is not possible and y is not possible supporting every move of LTA. If you do that, people will call you names and associate you with LTA/MOT. Wake up!! It is NOT ME who identified you from LTA/MOT first. There have been many others here, who have done that, and for a good reason. So instead of giving me a lecture, you go figure out, why you get flamed everytime.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, one final time. I am not from LTA/MOT. Please respect people when people tell you this. My opinion is purely my opinion. I don't support LTA in any way. You do not have any right to lord over the way that people want to respond in any manner. There is no need for you to be nanny to other people emails manners. I am not rude in any sense in my emails. This is my form of assertiveness. Sbst191 replied back to my emails to and fro. Nothing wrong with it until you step in and accuse people of double-standard with poor reasons. For me, I never go offend people or antagonize others until people do it first to me. Please do not link LTA to me irregardless of whether you are the first person or what. Thank you very much. Cheers.</p>

                      Haig road. Is it going to really inconvenience or provide a major
                      relief to Haig road residents? Let me answer. Your response will be
                      launch a new service. Is funds endless when the job can be done by

              <p>I agree with re-routing a bus service, especially if there are insufficient buses/drivers. The supply of bus drivers is not infinite.</p>
              <p>Here are some factorsabout recruitment of bus drivers:</p>
              <p>1: The driver may not be suitable for the job and may leave.</p>
              <p>2: The driver may not be comfortable with the long working hours and may leave.</p>
              <p>It would take more drivers to introduce a new service than to re-route an existing service, so which is more feasible?</p>

              <p><br>The buses that these operators have are horrible. There will be quite sometime until they understand operations and that could not be in interest of commuters. Also, these private operators are solely operating for profit, even more so than SBST/SMRT.</p>

              <p><br>That is only the buses part right? How about other services:</p>
              <p>- managing BCs, training, maintenance for a huge fleet of buses</p>
              <p>- website</p>
              <p>- monitoring bus arrival/scheduling times</p>
              <p>- appropriate bus deployment</p>
              <p>and many more... Hence, there needs to be a strong urge from the operator and a proper plan. Otherwise it will be like SMRT taking the operations from TIBS and providing not-so-good service even after getting many things from TIBS.</p>
              <p>It is only now that SMRT operations are improving (still not at SBST standards). If you compare SMRT operations 5 years back, 2 years back and now, they have improved - but it has taken a long time and provided discomfort to many for long time in the process.</p>

              <p>The bus industry is smaller than you think. Some employees and ex-employees do move around and take their knowledge with them. I do not expect private operators to be completely clueless.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, many of the existing systems would transition to Trapeze ITS when it is ready. Incumbents have to relearn the new system as well, so the footing is a little more equal at the initial stage. A few PPSS and CityDirect operators would have a rough idea of what they can expect from LTA and what to provide for LTA.</p>
              <p>There are some remaining components which prospective operators are on their own, and hopefully LTA will base these components to judge the quality of their bids.</p>
