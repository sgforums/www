              <p>Perhaps instead of having individual companies train bus
              captains, more could be done to provision for a organisation to
              manage bus operations. This should be seperate (but fully owned) by
              LTA.</p>
              <p>My idea is that this organisation shall provide driver training
              courses (either self funded or contracted by the new PTOs) to all
              who are keen to be omnibus drivers/captains. The course should
              involve training in the two most used single deck bus types, as
              well basic maintaience training, fare equipment training, customer
              service, english language courses, as well as other necessary
              training.</p>
              <p>In the case of a new applicant having taken up the course
              him/herself, the PTOs shall provide an additional incentive as well
              fully backpaying the amount the trainee paid for the course. This
              ensures that there is always a pool of drivers to tap on, similar
              to the current private bus driver vocational license scheme; and
              also could provide flexible training (shorter, part time, etc) for
              new captains who already have some form of experience (e.g. have
              class 4, BDVL, etc).</p>
              <p>Further training is then undertaken by indivdual PTOs for
              company specific ops, as well for different routes.</p>
              <p>Additional roles this organisation should undertake includes
              some functions which TfL is currently performing, such as placement
              of diversion signs during diversions and bus interior
              specification, design, and in the case of SG also procurement of
              buses and management of routes.</p>
              <p>This could be carved out of the current bus section in LTA.</p>

              <p>Driving schools? But they are not great in their current form.</p>
              <p>In Perth, permanent signs are placed at junctions that direct drivers to the correct routes. However, drivers still lose their way (they either ignore them or aren't aware of their existence).</p>

              <p>Early indications show that new entrants intend to take the easy way out - that is to give substantial raises to existing remuneration packages to lure qualified local and Malaysian bus captains away from the incumbent operators.</p>
              <p>If such a strategy is adopted, it will be a step closer for the fictional case study scenario I have written that may become a reality. I have updated the scenario by adding an extra sentence, as presented below. (Disclaimer: Merlion Transit is a fictional name and does not exist.)</p>
              <p>I will be very surprised if the incumbents do not respond in kind and rather risk QoS failure due to worsening bus captain shortage, which in turn will seriously jeopardize their prospects of winning future parcel tenders (or lose more territory, depending on your perspective).
                                          Otherwise I would expect the extra manpower costs to be passed on, which will result in significantly higher fare raises.</p>

              <p>Revised version of the fictional case study. This is based on previous
              incidents around the world (e.g. Macau, UK) and is meant to encourage planning for such contigencies:</p>
              <p><em>Merlion Transit, owned by Transport Tycoon, was set up to
              bid for the first parcel tender. The owner is an experienced
              overseas operator that has businesses in different parts of the
              world. Merlion Transit is able to use its expertise and knowledge
              to meet the quality aspects of the bid. However knowing that the
              first parcel tender was vital to setting a foothold as a Singapore
              operator given that the government is likely to limit the number of
              operators and competition is extremely fierce,  Merlion
              Transit decided to undercut everyone else for the first parcel
              tender thinking that it would be able to recoup the amount when it
              gain other parcel tenders in the future.</em></p>
              <p><em>In 2015, Merlion Transit won the first two parcel tenders
              and is set to become the third major bus operator in Singapore. To
              attract drivers over Merlion Transit promised to offer a high
              remuneration package, $300 more than the incumbent operators.
              However, just before the handover of routes to Merlion Transit the
              incumbent bus operators announced a $500 salary raise to all BCs to
              encourage them to stay rather than to go over to the new operator.
              Merlion Transit faced difficult questions from new prospective
              drivers who are much less inclined to accept the lower salary, and
              had to comply with the government framework to have the BCs not
              worse off than their current situation. Not wanting to cause a
              industrial dispute, Merlion Transit raised the salaries of BCs by
              $600.</em></p>
              <p><em>In November 2017, about a year after the general elections
              where the ruling party won comfortably after touting how the new
              competitive tender system brought benefits to public transport and
              resolved the bad times since 2011, Merlion Transit found itself to
              be in serious financial trouble. They realized that the current
              salary they were paying was unsustainable, and they had serious
              underestimated the running costs when they first bid for the
              contract. Furthermore, diesel prices have soared due to world
              events and while they were given the latest fleet of buses to
              operate, they realized that they have been assigned the powerful
              320hp and 360hp gas guzzlers. Other rival operators have raised the
              salaries of the drivers further to entice them to stay, as the
              industry as a whole still lacked drivers. Merlion Transit has not
              given a substantial increase since then and were pressured by their
              staff to do so. Unhappy with the disparity in remuneration, the
              staff threatened to take industrial action.</em></p>
              <p><em>On 15 December 2017, Merlion Transit had no more cash flow
              to continue operations and pay BCs their monthly salaries. The
              government has refused Merlion Transit's plea for increased
              subsidy. Transport Tycoon refused to bail the company out, knowing
              that he is going to exit the bus business in Singapore anyway.
              Merlion Transit declares bankruptcy. None of the services
              contracted to Merlion Transit operated that day, affecting 25% of
              the island's bus services.</em></p>

              <p>Revised version of the fictional case study. This is based on
                  previous incidents around the world (e.g. Macau, UK) and is meant
                  to encourage planning for such contigencies:</p>
              <p><em>Merlion Transit, owned by Transport Tycoon, was set up to
                  bid for the first parcel tender. The owner is an experienced
                  overseas operator that has businesses in different parts of the
                  world. Merlion Transit is able to use its expertise and knowledge
                  to meet the quality aspects of the bid. However knowing that the
                  first parcel tender was vital to setting a foothold as a Singapore
                  operator given that the government is likely to limit the number of
                  operators and competition is extremely fierce,  Merlion
                  Transit decided to undercut everyone else for the first parcel
                  tender thinking that it would be able to recoup the amount when it
                  gain other parcel tenders in the future.</em></p>
              <p><em>In 2015, Merlion Transit won the first two parcel tenders
                  and is set to become the third major bus operator in Singapore. To
                  attract drivers over Merlion Transit promised to offer a high
                  remuneration package, $300 more than the incumbent operators.
                  However, just before the handover of routes to Merlion Transit the
                  incumbent bus operators announced a $500 salary raise to all BCs to
                  encourage them to stay rather than to go over to the new operator.
                  Merlion Transit faced difficult questions from new prospective
                  drivers who are much less inclined to accept the lower salary, and
                  had to comply with the government framework to have the BCs not
                  worse off than their current situation. Not wanting to cause a
                  industrial dispute, Merlion Transit raised the salaries of BCs by
                  $600.</em></p>
              <p><em>In November 2017, about a year after the general elections
                  where the ruling party won comfortably after touting how the new
                  competitive tender system brought benefits to public transport and
                  resolved the bad times since 2011, Merlion Transit found itself to
                  be in serious financial trouble. They realized that the current
                  salary they were paying was unsustainable, and they had serious
                  underestimated the running costs when they first bid for the
                  contract. Furthermore, diesel prices have soared due to world
                  events and while they were given the latest fleet of buses to
                  operate, they realized that they have been assigned the powerful
                  320hp and 360hp gas guzzlers. Other rival operators have raised the
                  salaries of the drivers further to entice them to stay, as the
                  industry as a whole still lacked drivers. Merlion Transit has not
                  given a substantial increase since then and were pressured by their
                  staff to do so. Unhappy with the disparity in remuneration, the
                  staff threatened to take industrial action.</em></p>
              <p><em>On 15 December 2017, Merlion Transit had no more cash flow
                  to continue operations and pay BCs their monthly salaries. The
                  government has refused Merlion Transit's plea for increased
                  subsidy. Transport Tycoon refused to bail the company out, knowing
                  that he is going to exit the bus business in Singapore anyway.
                  Merlion Transit declares bankruptcy. None of the services
                  contracted to Merlion Transit operated that day, affecting 25% of
                  the island's bus services.</em></p>
              <p><em>What would the government do?</em></p>

              <p>Personally, I do not think the bus companies will increase the salary without considering factors such as costs. They will surely review their operations before adjusting the salary, otherwise it is not sustainable.</p>
              <p>If they are not able to raise the salary without affecting their operations, I think it is only wise that they either raise salary and scale down (give up packages) or maintain the salary and improve other areas such as fringe benefits (eg. more comfortable seats for drivers, better engines, better jacket against cold, discounted bus rides, etc.).</p>
              <p>If at any point of time the bus company starts showing signs of financial difficulties, I think the government should intervene and take actions.</p>
              <p>First is to provide loans to trigger the bus company to turnover and recover. If the first action fails, second is to shorten the bus company's contract term and open the package for bids and let other bus companies take over the bus contract and operate it.</p>
              <p>A bit similar to how the taxi industry is reviewed annually and how a taxi company was asked to close down last year.</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that similar to the taxi industry, when the bus contracts model is implemented, the government should do regular reviews on the bus contracts to check if the bus companies are operating healthily.</p>
              <p>This should prevent the scenario of bus services not running because a bus company declares bankrupt due to financial losses.</p>

              <p>I think its hard to deny the fact that monetary incentive is the best tool to get workers when there is a shortage. No matter what welfare you give, money is what feeds the family. Money also naturally brings more workers into this industry.</p>

              <p>The government can plan, can give a number. But at the very end, where are the bus captains going to come from? They don't simply appear out of thin air, especially not forgetting the training required.</p>

              <p>Agree... at least on SBST side... there are so many SP WEGs and Citaros from BSEP... that SBST/LTA does not know which services to give to. </p>
              <p>Also all new services launched are short-haul.. taking fewer buses and not needing WEGs... it would have been more effective if sv like 50/972 were launched...</p>

              <p>In response to this post: <a href="/forums/1279/topics/486959">http://sgforums.com/forums/1279/topics/486959</a></p>
              <p>There are enough articulated buses and double-decker buses as a whole to go around. The only problem is that this ratio is disproportionate in both incumbent operators.</p>
              <p>I am thinking if the government is willing to take a bold step to ditch this restriction of bus fleet divided along operator's lines under the new contracting model.</p>
              <p>That is, certain feeder routes currently under the purview of SBS Transit to use articulated buses under the new contracting model, and SMRT Buses trunk routes currently using articulated buses substituted with double-decker buses under the new contracting model.</p>
              <p>Of course, this is provided that the transport planners at LTA deem the operation of articulated buses as appropriate in the long term. It is possible that LTA may have already made their intentions known (or even plan to implement this very idea) in the tender documents. At this point I am making speculations, as these documents are not available for public access for legal reasons and I do not know what its contents are.</p>
              <p>Fleet exchange is not going to happen between operators in the meantime. The only way for this to happen is when the entire fleet comes under one common ownership.</p>
