              <p>Some buses can be deployed out of their contract areas too. I have seen buses from Gosnells on Route 527, which belongs to Canning GCM and the responsibility of Canning Vale depot.</p>
              <p>Shenton Park occasionally does City Beach routes, which are under Marmion. In the past, we used to see the odd Wanneroo bus on these routes back when Path Transit had a monopoly of the northern suburbs bus routes.</p>
              <p>Technically Route 36 can be run from Bayswater, although it is officially with Kalamunda, as Bayswater depot is closest to Midland. Provided they have enough buses, of course.</p>

              <p>That is what causes the problem. Because the GCM operators do not have to use their money for maintenance (not even the money paid by LTA), so they can offer ridiculously cheap advertising.</p>

              <p>They are not exactly guaranteed profits. Yes, they will have profits if they manage the payouts carefully while fulfilling all agreed standards within the contract. Even better if they exceed and receive incentives. Less or no profits or even losses if they are regularly fined for poor performance and have money deducted from their fees.</p>
              <p>Judging from their performance yesterday and today, what do you think?</p>
              <p>and are you sure operators do not need to pay to maintain the buses? who says? LTA buys and owns the buses but it is the operators who maintain the bus and the equipment onboard using the fees they are being paid. maintenance costs as a result of their proposals are covered by the fees. again they will have to use the fees wisely.</p>

              <p>Saw this article (<a href="http://www.channel8news.sg/news8/latestnews/20160530-sg-tower-transit/2829602.html?cid=ch8news-fb#.V0xHJ8A8D84.link">"Tower Transit é¦–å·¥ä½œæ—¥é¡ºåˆ© å¢žåŠ å·´å£«æ•°é‡�è‡³94"; 30 May 2016</a>) on Channel 8 news, which I find it quite interesting.</p>
                          <p>The news reporter commented that Tower Transit "æ•´ä½“è¿�ä½œç›¸å½“é¡ºåˆ©ï¼Œä¸�è¿‡è¿˜éœ€å¤šè§‚å¯Ÿä¸€é˜µå­�ï¼Œä»¥ç¡®ä¿�çŽ°æœ‰å®‰æŽ’å…·å�¯æŒ�ç»­æ€§ã€‚" (overall operations quite smooth, but need to observe for a while to ensure that existing arrangements can continue.)</p>
                          <p>A professor from NUS felt that "ä¸€äº›éƒ¨åˆ†å°†éœ€è¦�æ—¶é—´è®©ä¸€åˆ‡ç¨³å®šä¸‹æ�¥è®©è½¦é•¿ç†Ÿæ‚‰æ–°ç³»ç»Ÿï¼Œè®©ä¹˜å®¢ç†Ÿæ‚‰æ–°æ¨¡å¼�ã€‚" (some parts need time to let everything settle down to let drivers familiarise with the new system, and let passengers familiarise with the new model.)</p>
                          <p>One passenger noticed that "å�¯èƒ½è¿™æ˜¯è½¦é•¿é¦–æ¬¡é©¾é©¶ï¼Œæ‰€ä»¥ä»–ä»¬æ¯”è¾ƒè°¨æ…Žï¼Œè½¦é€Ÿæ¯”ä¸€èˆ¬çš„æ…¢ã€‚" (probably because this is the drivers' first time drive bus, so they more careful and drive slower.)</p>

              <p>Well, my conscious is clear. I do not know why is someone so
              against me, but, the previous posts I wrote actually proved his
              claims otherwise. I have been reading press releases and annual
              reports. Personally, I feel that there is no point stirring shit to
              encourage people to write in the forum.</p>
              <p>Anyway, today, I was on bus services 106 and 173, from around
              12:30pm to 1:30pm. Both were late by 1-2 mins. The LTA mytransport
              app say 106 will arrive in 3 mins, but the bus arrived 5 mins
              later. The app say 173 will arrive in 9 mins, but the bus arrived
              10 mins later.... but gotta give TT benefit of doubt, cuz as far as
              I know, SBS also got buses that do not come on time, so actually TT
              quite good already. :)</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, there is a picture on (buses[in]gapore!) Facebook
              page which shows a green MAN A22 on bus service 925... I guess it
              may be related to the third GCM package.</p>
