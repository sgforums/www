              <p>I agree, it is difficult to manage a joint-operated bus route.
                   This HK wikia page breaks down how it is done in HK (in
                  Traditional Chinese):</p>
              <p><a title="http://hkbus.wikia.com/wiki/%E8%81%AF%E7%87%9F%E7%B7%9A" href="http://hkbus.wikia.com/wiki/%E8%81%AF%E7%87%9F%E7%B7%9A" rel="nofollow">http://hkbus.wikia.com/wiki/%E8%81%AF%E7%87%9F%E7%B7%9A</a></p>
              <p>I wouldn't recommend it for Singapore.  It is too complex
                  and too much stuffs to handle, especially when they hand over the
                  packages to different operators at the end of the contract.
                   Allocation of resources and revenue sharing are some problems
                  but not the only problems.  There will be problems with
                  dispatch timings, but at least not as bad as Hong Kong since we are
                  under GCM.  In Hong Kong, they worry about things like their
                  version of iris will not work well with 2 different companies'
                  buses.  Here, we do not need to worry since stop arrival times
                  are synced with LTA.  Still, I think joint operation is too
                  much for us to handle just yet.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Perth seems to be doing well where joint operator control is concerned. The Circle Route 98/99 has input from 3 contractors from 3 depots, and Route 950 falls under 2 contract areas belonging to different operators.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if anything, Route 61 should have been made joint SBS/SMB years ago. 61 could be BUDEP majority and BNDEP minority. SMB supplies artics while SBS provides DDs. BUDEP can have 20/32 buses, 10 of which are rigid and 10 artic. BNDEP can have 12/32 buses, 8 of which are DD and 4 SD.</p>

              <p>The much-anticipated common livery will be unveiled in the "A
              Bulim Carnival Day" event to be organised by the Tower Transit on
              Sunday, Dec 6, 2015, 10:00 am to 04:00 pm, at the Bulim Bus
              Depot.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if it's only to see the common livery, do not bother
              going. It's probably going to be shared on leading websites and
              Facebook pages about bus services anyway. So what for waste time go
              there?</p>
              <p>By the way, "Bus Wrap" means bus advertisement. Do not be fooled
              by the word. It's only the advertisement, not the livery.</p>

                      <p>"The event will be an activity-filled one for both adults and children. Other than joining a walking tour of the depot and taking a bus ride through the bus wash, there will be carnival games, mini-exhibitions by Tower Transit Singapore and LTA, <strong>a display of bus livery</strong>, and food and drinks. There will also be a design competition, where the winner will have their design featured on an actual bus. For the children (and the children at heart), bouncy castle, airbrush tattoos, a photobooth and balloon-sculpting are activities that will keep them occupied! Participants who are at the event between 11AM and 1PM will also be able to watch the official opening ceremony of the Bulim Bus Depot."</p>

              <h2 class="news_brief">Go-Ahead Group is currently the largest bus operator in London. It put in the lowest bid of $497.7 million for the five-year contract to run the Loyang bus package.</h2>
              <h2 class="news_brief">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: London's largest bus operator Go-Ahead Group has won the bid to operate bus services in Pasir Ris and Punggol, announced the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Monday (Nov 23).</p>
              <p>The Loyang bus package is the second contract put up for bidding in the Government's new bus contracting model. Go-Ahead Group is the second bid winner from the UK, after <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tower-transit-unveils/2254530.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">London-based Tower Transit</span></span></a> won the bid for the first bus package in May.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead will operate the new Loyang bus depot from December. The company will run 25 services from Changi Airport and Changi Village bus terminals as well as, as well as the Pasir Ris and Punggol bus interchanges. The services will terminate at Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Sengkang, Tampines and Yishun bus interchanges as well as New Bridge Road and Upper East Coast bus terminals. These services will be rolled out in two tranches from the third quarter of next year.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead will receive about S$497.7 million from LTA over the five-year contract period. Australia's Busways Group submitted the highest bid of S$631.4 million, while local operators SBS Transit and SMRT Buses submitted bids of $545.9 million and $598.1 million respectively.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead currently runs 24 per cent of London's bus routes with about 2,300 buses and about 7,000 staff.</p>
              <p>In a news release on Monday, LTA said Go-Ahead was awarded the contract as it had the highest score for both quality and price.</p>
              <p>"Go-Ahead demonstrated a thorough understanding of ground conditions and strong ability in developing strategies to manage specific scenarios for each bus route," LTA said. "At the same time, Go-Ahead also emphasised in its proposal a stringent bus maintenance regime for bus assets and infrastructure."</p>
              <p>The tender for the Loyang bus package was launched on Apr 15, and closed on Aug 14. Depending on Go-Ahead's performance, LTA said the contract can be extended by two years.</p>

              <h1>Second UK transport operator wins bid to run bus
              services in Singapore</h1>
              <h2>Go-Ahead Group is currently the largest bus operator
              in London. It put in the lowest bid of $497.7 million for the
              five-year contract to run the Loyang bus package.</h2>
              <p>SINGAPORE: London's largest bus operator Go-Ahead Group has won
              the bid to operate bus services in Pasir Ris and Punggol, announced
              the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Monday (Nov 23).</p>
              <p>The Loyang bus package is the second contract put up for bidding
              in the Government's new bus contracting model. Go-Ahead Group is
              the second bid winner from the UK, after <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tower-transit-unveils/2254530.html"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">London-based Tower Transit</span></span></a> won
              the bid for the first bus package in May.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead will operate the new Loyang bus depot from December.
              The company will run 25 services from Changi Airport and Changi
              Village bus terminals as well as, as well as the Pasir Ris and
              Punggol bus interchanges. The services will terminate at Ang Mo
              Kio, Bedok, Sengkang, Tampines and Yishun bus interchanges as well
              as New Bridge Road and Upper East Coast bus terminals. These
              services will be rolled out in two tranches from the third quarter
              of next year.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead will receive about S$497.7 million from LTA over the
              five-year contract period. Australia's Busways Group submitted the
              highest bid of S$631.4 million, while local operators SBS Transit
              and SMRT Buses submitted bids of $545.9 million and $598.1 million
              respectively.</p>
              <p>Go-Ahead currently runs 24 per cent of London's bus routes with
              about 2,300 buses and about 7,000 staff.</p>
              <p>In a news release on Monday, LTA said Go-Ahead was awarded the
              contract as it had the highest score for both quality and
              price.</p>
              <p>"Go-Ahead demonstrated a thorough understanding of ground
              conditions and strong ability in developing strategies to manage
              specific scenarios for each bus route," LTA said. "At the same
              time, Go-Ahead also emphasised in its proposal a stringent bus
              maintenance regime for bus assets and infrastructure."</p>
              <p>The tender for the Loyang bus package was launched on Apr 15,
              and closed on Aug 14. Depending on Go-Ahead's performance, LTA said
              the contract can be extended by two years.</p>

              <p>Wasn't there a batch of Wrights &amp; Citaros with the SG xxxx regoes in Bulim previously? I suppose there should be a batch like that for Go-Ahead.</p>
              <p>There's already like 5x new Wright B9TLs &amp; at least 14x new Citaros parked in Loyang Depot as of today. But those 19+ buses were in SBST livery. </p>

              <p>For that Pasir Ris package, cash-cows definitely Sv 2, 12, 36
              &amp; 518. Maybe 34 &amp; 43 also. But apart from Pasir Ris (&amp;
              i think Punggol), at least they left the other services at CGA
              &amp; CGV with SBST still. <br> <br> Just a pity that Sv 2 is going to Go-Ahead after so many decades
              with SBST. </p>
              <p>I think LTA is giving out those solely BN/HG services though.
              That's why 88, 72, 59 &amp; 21 are excluded (Sv 21 even though it's
              split AM/BN)</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, system has changed. No more cash-cows or whatsoever. Govt takes all revenue earned from all services and just paid them a sum of money over 5 years. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>HAHA. Dude. I was replying to his earlier comment (wsy1234) about which are the services with higher-demand from this package.

              <p>72 under TAM route group. That will come under another package. Every dog will have its day. Just a matter of time.</p>

              <p>SBS lost JUE, now PSR &amp; PGL too. SMB only lost BBT. I sense a breakup of SBS near monopoly.</p>

              <p>Makes sense for TT to get Ulu Pandan (likely BBDEP replacement) and GAG to take Kim Chuan (possible HGDEP replacement)</p>
