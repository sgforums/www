              <p>IMO, I think Loyang Depot closer to Punggol than Hougang Depot (slightly). Tampines cannot include all services, but can take in a few which is convinient enough so its end point is not too far. Putting 136 under Loyang is a dumb move though.</p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, your facts are wrong. Punggol is nearer to Hougang depot than Loyang depot by distance. By geographical position, tampines is nearer to Loyang depot than punggol and should have provided bulk of its service. Punggol and sengkang should have come under the new seletar depot in future. Quite bad of a decision! Cheers.</p>

              <p>I think Punggol to Loyang depot may be a bit faster than to Hougang depot since it's via TPE direct. Anyway according to URA's master plan (https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/), Hougang depot and the surrounding areas may be redeveloped in future. Kranji depot and Ayer Rajah bus park also gone, although BB, BN, AM, BR, WL and SL still there. May not be accurate though, since the land for Loyang depot is still shown as industrial area "subject to detailed planning".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just realised the LTA press release says Loyang Depot will be completed in June this year, but the operator will only take over in second half of 2016. So will it be sitting empty until next year, or will SBST use it temporarily, like how SMRT is using Bulim depot now?</p>

              <p>If no replacement for Ayer Rajah, next nearest is Braddell. There is a very high chance Braddell will run out of space because it needs to take in so many loop service in CBD. After Braddell is Bukit Batok, AMK and Hougang. The trend is that they are trying to shift (reasonably) as many service as possible out of these depots first (Clementi/JE moved t<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">o Bulim, Punggol moved to Loyang), as the most problematic depots will be Ayer Rajah and Braddell. There is only so much these two can take in under GCM, and priority is most likely given to Central/South loop services.</span></p>
              <p>Mandai is too far to replace Bukit Batok</p>

              <p>Hi mr proudtobeme, haha not an issue of crowdiness. You must not

              and pasir ris drive 3/Loyang avenue area connecting to Loyang

              <p>What are the chances of services being caught in a jam on these two roads between 11pm - 5am? (The time where most buses travel to and from depots) By the time the jam started, most of the buses reached and deployed already.</p>
