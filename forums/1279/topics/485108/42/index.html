              <p>stop comparing with HK all the time. They are different cities altogether. HK is much larger that warrants even more express services. The dynamics are different. You make it sound like SG public transport is shit. It is awesome. There can be improvements and that's what we discuss here. Don't be little the public infrastructure.</p>

              <p>The thing about Singapore is that we are not like Johor Bahru or Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>The 20-km bus routes at Johor Bahru and Hong Kong take around thirty minutes to complete.</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree we need bus routes to complement the MRT.</p>
              <p>I guess the limitation is on the travel time.</p>
              <p>If an express bus route is very long (more than 30km) and travel time is around thirty minutes from one end to the other, I think we can consider it. :)</p>

                          we plan and build our rail lines, making sure it serves future housing

                           network to 360km in 2030. This means that Singaporeâs rail network 
                          density will be comparable to cities like London, New York City and 
                          Tokyo. More households will be served directly by rail networks, and 
                          commuters can hop on to different train lines to get to their

              <p>South Island line is okay as population of South HK Island isnt large to begin with... As compared to the entire HK population</p>
              <p>But comparing population of the entire East Shore and entire Thomson area to the SG population, and they STILL had the audacity to use four car trains...</p>
              <p>And "higher freq" is nothing but an excus to get away with the problems... Coz no matter how many trains you buy if you cant sustain or, worse still, wont sustain thr dense freq the trains are gonna end up sleeping in the depots anyway... This could clearly be seen on the CCL...Â </p>
              <p>I also dk what they were thinking when they were doing white paper... Clearly there isnt a strong coordination between the ministries, LTA included...Â </p>
              <p>I could not imagine the Bishan stn in the coming years... It is as if population is directly propotional to number of trains, with k being the constant... Meaning that the crowds today are not gonna be allevated, if not worse...</p>

              <p>So they say they need to be clever in using our limited land resource. So instead of using some land temporarily to build MRT with longer trains, they choose to make more people unable to board the trains and end up driving instead, utilizing even more land resource... What a joke!</p>

              <p>About the new livery...</p>
              <p>I believe the new GCM livery may be already hinted from those
              Better Ride LTA posters... someone mentioned before, white front
              half and orange rear half, which has been seen on graciousness
              posters and in the LTA FB videos. And also the Off-Peak Pass BSEP
              ad follows that colour.</p>
