              <p>Hi. There will be a new bus depot at Ulu Pandan, by 2018. Similar to the earlier new depots at Sungei Seletar, Loyang and Bulim, it will accomodate around five hundred buses.</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2015: Bulim (West)</span></li>

              <p>Of the twelve packages, so far, we already know five of them.</p>
              <p>This is the second new depot in the West. Apparently, of the twelve depots (one depot one package), it seems that there will be four in the West, four in the East, four in the North.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">Based on the location of Ulu Pandan Bus Depot along Boon Lay Way, I think it will manage bus services of Clementi Bus Interchange.</span></p>

              <p>So far, in the West, two have been announced, one at Bulim and
              one at Ulu Pandan.</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bulim manages Jurong East and
              Bukit Batok. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Ulu Pandan may manage
              Clementi and ..... Boon Lay?</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whereas for the remaining
              two, I think one is definitely for Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Panjang,
              with the depot probably somewhere along Woodlands Road, near Kranji
              Expressway.</span></li>
              </ol>
              <div>... okay.. I'm sorry... was writing halfway and I cannot think
              anymore...</div>
              <div>Seriously, besides Clementi, is there another bus interchange
              in the vicinity that is not under any existing GCM? If this new
              depot at Ulu Pandan manages Boon Lay Bus Interchange, then really,
              I think it is in the wrong location... but where else is possible?
              somemore Clementi area the roads very congested...  well, at
              least it is next to both expressways... okay la... Boon Lay is
              likely... but in that case, I think Joo Koon is better, because it
              is nearer to expressway.... maybe it will manage Clementi and Joo
              Koon, while manage some of the bus services surrounding it, such as
              185, 502, 506...</div>
              <p style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;"> just now I say of
              the two remaining new bus depots that is likely to be built, one of
              them may be for CCK and BP. if the UP depot manages Clementi and
              Joo Koon, then I think the second remaining new bus depot may be
              for Tuas and Boon Lay....</p>
              <p style="line-height: 26.2613315582275px;">well, just my two cents
              worth.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It should swap route packages with Bulim.</p>
              <p>But it could also replace Bukit Batok and/or Ayer Rajah</p>
              <p>If Ulu Pandan manage the two ares you mention, then what is the point of Soon Lee?</p>
              <p>Oh, and you forgot Mandai, so that is 6 confirm.</p>

              <p>I think the trend is that every new depot will manage up to 26 bus services, with around 23 existing and 3 future.</p>
              <p>I believe eventually, every existing depot built before 2013 will be replaced.</p>
              <p>Bulim takes up 4 of Clementi, 13 of Jurong East and 9 of Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>Ayer Rajah may manage the remainder of Clementi (14 - 5 = 9), remainder of Jurong East (19 - 13 = 6) and the remainder of Bukit Batok (11 - 9 = 2). This constitutes to (9+6+2) 17 bus services. </p>
              <p>Whereas for the other (23 - 17) six existing bus services, it may either originate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange or Buona Vista Bus Terminal.</p>
              <p>Well, this is just my two cents worth.</p>

              <p>I thought the routes/services allocated to a GCM depot is already finalised when it is announced to public? </p>
              <p>So, there's no likelihood that bus services at Bulim GCM depot will be reallocated to the Ulu Pandan GCM depot. It's not going to happen.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, every bus depot built/owned by the operators themselves will be replaced with new bus depots built/owned by the government.</p>
              <p>What happens when a bus depot has been totally replaced? Well, the operator can either use it for other purpose, or sell away. Simple.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Notice every new depot built by the government can accommodate between five hundred to five hundred and fifty buses? On the assumption that the twelve packages will be hosted by twelve depots, this means eventually, there will be around six thousand buses on the roads.</p>
              <p>On a less complicated side, notice every new bus depot built by the government can accommodate around twenty five bus services? When there are twelve such depots, this means three hundred bus services.</p>
              <p>According to the statistics, in 2011, there are already three hundred and forty four bus routes. With BSEP, there will eventually be eighty new bus routes and in total, there will be four hundred and twenty four bus services.</p>
              <p>In order to have 424 bus services, we need around seventeen bus depots each with capacity for 25 bus services. Twelve may not be enough.</p>
              <p>Yes, I know of the 80, not all is run by public operators. Around 30 will be city direct or PPSS, so it's actually around 50 new public routes. Nonetheless, even if 50, total is 394. </p>
              <p>394 divide by 25 is 15.76, round up is 16. Still larger than 12.</p>
              <p>With that, we can expect some packages to use two depots. It's either this way, or there are actually more than twelve bus packages.</p>

              <p>NiteOwl and NightRider will depend on both operator and South area GCM. They also do not require too much buses to operate.</p>

              <p>Notice every new depot built by the government can accommodate
              between five hundred to five hundred and fifty buses? On the
              assumption that the twelve packages will be hosted by twelve
              depots, this means eventually, there will be around six thousand
              buses on the roads.</p>
              <p>On a less complicated side, notice every new bus depot built by
              the government can accommodate around twenty five bus services?
              When there are twelve such depots, this means three hundred bus
              services.</p>
              <p>According to the statistics, in 2011, there are already three
              hundred and forty four bus routes. With BSEP, there will eventually
              be eighty new bus routes and in total, there will be four hundred
              and twenty four bus services.</p>
              <p>In order to have 424 bus services, we need around seventeen bus
              depots each with capacity for 25 bus services. Twelve may not be
              enough.</p>
              <p>Yes, I know of the 80, not all is run by public operators.
              Around 30 will be city direct or PPSS, so it's actually around 50
              new public routes. Nonetheless, even if 50, total is 394. </p>
              <p>394 divide by 25 is 15.76, round up is 16. Still larger than
              12.</p>
              <p>With that, we can expect some packages to use two depots. It's
              either this way, or there are actually more than twelve bus
              packages.</p>

              <p>For the NightRider / Nite Owl services, they just give to a operator who share buses with normal routes (such as 518/4N in Loyang) and (such as 106/NR5 in Bulim). Bedok North can go to NR7, thus freeing up 6N. The Sungei Seletar will be NR1 &amp; NR6.</p>

              <p>Interesting insights there!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, only Ayer rajah bus park and SMRT amk depot need replacement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rest are quite strategically located and in fact much better location than the new depot LTA are building.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well unless the govt has plans to redevelop the land currently occupied by the SBST and SMRTB depots. Which i doubt so...because most are in established industrial estates...what else can they build there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, the Ulu Pandan depot is going to be a multi storey one? I cannot seem to find such info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it is, then it will certainly be good news and a good direction for the future.</p>

              <div><br></div>
