              <p>i tot SBST/SMRT also implement this previously, but gotten some complains and thus no longer doing it.. buses which are late, will switch EDS to off service after certain bus stop and then just continue to alight passengers but not allowing any paxs to board,</p>

                  <p>Have you even looked at the QoS performance figures? If you take away periodic compulsory retendering then there is no reasonable prospect of a change in the bus operator running in your area in your lifetime!</p>
                  <p>In fact I find 5 + 2 years to be too long. It should have been 3 + 2 years. The longer the contract period is, the more likely the operator will become complacent. The first train operating contract in Singapore was 30 years, and we all know what that outcome was. Stretch that longer and we will be back to square one but with much higher fares.</p>
                  <p>If there is no review by LTA after a set period, then you basically have no recourse if the operators decides to throw you off the bus for any reason whatsoever. Your only alternative is for you to quietly pay COE to LTA and drive to work. If you can't afford that, then you are what transport management textbooks describe as "captive audience" and can be taken with little or no regard.</p>

              <p>Come across this article in Voice page of Today. Quite interesting, in army term is call LPPL.</p>
              <p>Open All bus routes to competition</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/voices/open-all-bus-routes-competition">http://www.todayonline.com/voices/open-all-bus-routes-competition</a></p>
              <p>The Government has introduced the bus contracting model, under which it will own and fund the bus infrastructure while contracting route services out via a competitive tender process.</p>
              <p>It believes this will help raise service standards by increasing competition and creating more flexibility in response to changes in ridership and commuter needs.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Three packages, making up about 20 per cent of routes, will be tendered out first. The inaugural package of 26 routes went to London-based operator Tower Transit. This has been well received, generally (“Foreign bus operators will help push up standards”; May 14).</p>
              <p>The irony is that the remaining 80 per cent will be grouped into nine packages and run by incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT on negotiated contracts under the contracting model for about five years, after their Bus Service Operating Licences expire next year.</p>
              <p>Why the double standards? And if all remaining route parcels end up in the hands of the existing players, the exercise would be futile. If the incumbents could fulfil their roles satisfactorily, why is a new model needed?</p>
              <p>It appears the Government wants competition but also sees the need to protect the existing operators. This will lead to the latter being complacent.</p>
              <p>If it is believed that the competitive tender process will improve service standards, all bus routes should be opened up for tender. This would really shake up the current privatised model.</p>
              <p>Also, all bus fares will go to the Government, which could thus make a possible profit or loss from the bus contracting. It will bear the burden of justifying any fare adjustments.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, it should strive to maintain a break-even position as far as possible and adjust bus fares. Commuters would then benefit further from the new model.</p>

              <p>With Kalamunda the contract period became 8 years. Not sure about Midland and Morley that were tendered last year.</p>
              <p>If CDGE (who already own Swan Taxi) were allowed to participate in future tenders I hope they get something. Rockingham, Southern River, Canning and Claremont, as well as the City CAT haven't been up for a fresh round of tendering, AFAIK.</p>

              <p>Adams Coachlines tried to bid for one of the contracts. If there was a newcomer well-positioned to come in, it would probably be them. They didn't succeed.</p>
              <p>Not sure if ComfortDelgro Cabcharge is interested in Transperth. Their taxis are doing a roaring business though.</p>
              <p>Thinking about this, I am not optimistic at this stage that Singapore would go beyond a third operator. Think about Singapore's telecomms industry, HK's franchised bus industry (the third operator NWFB was also won by tendering in a similar fashion, and nothing much has changed since), as well as Perth and Adelaide public bus industry.</p>

              <p>Come across this article in Voice page of Today. Quite
                      interesting, in army term is call LPPL.</p>
              <p>Open All bus routes to competition</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/voices/open-all-bus-routes-competition">http://www.todayonline.com/voices/open-all-bus-routes-competition</a></p>
              <p>The Government has introduced the bus contracting model, under
                      which it will own and fund the bus infrastructure while contracting
                      route services out via a competitive tender process.</p>
              <p>It believes this will help raise service standards by increasing
                      competition and creating more flexibility in response to changes in
                      ridership and commuter needs.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- inline --&gt;</p>
              <p>Three packages, making up about 20 per cent of routes, will be
                      tendered out first. The inaugural package of 26 routes went to
                      London-based operator Tower Transit. This has been well received,
                      generally (“Foreign bus operators will help push up standards”; May
                      14).</p>
              <p>The irony is that the remaining 80 per cent will be grouped into
                      nine packages and run by incumbents SBS Transit and SMRT on
                      negotiated contracts under the contracting model for about five
                      years, after their Bus Service Operating Licences expire next
                      year.</p>
              <p>Why the double standards? And if all remaining route parcels end
                      up in the hands of the existing players, the exercise would be
                      futile. If the incumbents could fulfil their roles satisfactorily,
                      why is a new model needed?</p>
              <p>It appears the Government wants competition but also sees the
                      need to protect the existing operators. This will lead to the
                      latter being complacent.</p>
              <p>If it is believed that the competitive tender process will
                      improve service standards, all bus routes should be opened up for
                      tender. This would really shake up the current privatised
                      model.</p>
              <p>Also, all bus fares will go to the Government, which could thus
                      make a possible profit or loss from the bus contracting. It will
                      bear the burden of justifying any fare adjustments.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, it should strive to maintain a break-even position
                      as far as possible and adjust bus fares. Commuters would then
                      benefit further from the new model.</p>

              <p>gov want to see the results first mah for the first 3 tenders... let them operate for 5 years first, before deciding to go ahead with tendering of all remaining packages or back to square one...</p>
              <p>imagine, right now all 12 packages tender out and let say 6 operators got it ï¼ˆand SBST/SMRT does not get any or just get one), and after 5 years, all decide that it is not worth the effort to operate it.... and all pull out suddenly, so who will be coming in to take over? Singapore communters are alway complaining and whatever promise that these new operators made wont be so easily fulfilled, esp on buses arriving at bus stop at per timetable...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>further, the bus fares are set to raise further... this writer will then come complain again.... LTA wll just show that the cost of contracts for one year is far far more than the revenue collected....thus need to raise fare... </p>
