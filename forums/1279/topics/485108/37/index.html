So many management position to fill?then need to find another 700 bus drivers?? Now they need to hire bus captain of course say nice nice thing lah. </p>

              <p>when did LTA mention no delay at all? there is one year delay, which was minimize to 3 months..  Govt alway pay on progress... They wont be giving out 500 million to a contractor at start of project..  like that i also want to bid and then run road... LTA's contract consist of lots of penalty for delaying/breaking contract, which can come up to 1million per day of delay...</p>

              company can offer higher pay than now. </p>
              <p>the impact is simple first government slowly remove forginers
              drivers from the sector than in come the new public bus company
              offer pay better benefits. look like suddenly local bus drivers in
              demand. wow. not compare these to other country airline this is not
              airline industry. do you know that in USA the budget airline pilot
              pay lower than a bus driver?</p>
              <p>http://news.omy.sg/News/Local-News/story20150511-345577. this is
              from yesterday chinese news paper. i wonder any english version

              <p>In my opinion, at the end of the day, everything remains the same. People who drive bus will continue to drive bus. People who maintain the bus will continue to maintain the bus. People who control bus services will control bus services. ..... <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is just a change of name, that's all. and, of course, pay.</span></p>
              <p>In my opinion, I do not think pay will keep increasing. eventually, it will be kept constant at a certain level, unless if one or a few other variables experience a fall in costs, then maybe pay will then increase.</p>
              <p>well, in my opinion, I feel that the objective of the GCM is only to work on the management level, to make adjustments to which company manages the bus services, that's all.</p>
              <p>just my two cents worth. just some casual remarks. #justsaying </p>

              <p>they are short of BC now.. and definitely if these BC choose to stay, they can definitely be deploy somewhere, esp with more BSEP buses coming in.... 350 BSEP buses mean at least 500 BC more plus if they have more BCs, they can give the BC a day off each week (for SBST case, as understand that currently some BCs are only having 1 day off every 2 weeks)..</p>

              <p>One very one-size-fits-all solution that can be used to address the shortage of number of people working as Bus Drivers/Captains:</p>
              <p>Introduce a Certificate course at the ITE, and/or introduce a Diploma course at the Polytechnic, to train people to drive buses.</p>
              <p>Right now, isn't there already a new Diploma on transport management? Maybe in future, we can have new diploma or certificate courses on driving buses.</p>
              <p>Maybe entry level as technicians, to familiarise with the components. Then rise to be bus drivers, to drive the bus. then rise from single to double decker. Thereafter, with technician and bus driver experience, rise to traffic controller. Thereafter, to supervisor. Etcetera...</p>
              <p>Rise until top already, then promote to work for LTA. within LTA, rise, rise, rise,... rise... rise until top of LTA already, then promote to work for the transport ministry.</p>
