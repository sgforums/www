              <p>If a foreign operator wins, high chance they might operate like SMRT policy too. SMRT smart- they decide to give up being stubborn and buy DDs just in time before this bus contracting model came about so they are quite diversified. Most of the foreign operators have experience with DDs and articulated buses and I believe they have more experience on articulated buses because they are more commonly used in the world.

              <p>Yes, I would agree that the UK operator will be more inclined to DDs. In London BB were withdrawn because of the fires and because they were hard to drive on the roads. Their roads were just too narrow and so the full length bendy bus was hard to drive. Their replacements are 2axle DD which is of course easier to turn. In sg case, our DDs are 3 axle and so its definitely harder to maneuvre as compared to a bendy bus, especially feeders. Therefore speed and efficiency is compromised. BTW I dont think articulated buses are extinct in UK, they were just withdrawn from london and to what I read before, these operators transferred these bendys to other states (correct me if I am wrong).</p>
              <p>Yes you are right, the need for articulated buses in the Bulim package is not so great except maybe in BBT because SBST has trained people on the DDs all their life. But imo, if an operator is going to better the services there in terms of efficiency,  it would be wise to propose articulated buses for the feeders in that package because for sg context,  articulated buses have performed well in feeders (London had no feeder routes). Whether that proposal is seen as an edge or not over others remains to be seen with LTAs view on Bendys.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, french and china operators are also Bendy/SD I believe</p>

              do not think it is logical for an operator to use a bus that has
              prefix of another operator. By the way, around twenty years ago
              when <span class="">SBS</span> and <span class="">TIBS</span>
              exchanged buses, werenâ€™t those buses re-registered again?<p></p>

              If LTA decides to replace all the bus rego, i hope they only change the 1st 3 alphabets only. eg:
              SBS5012J becomes TLA5012J
              SMB5012T becomes TLB5012T

              <p>True. Even UK is moving towards converting majority of its fleet to 3 axle DD now. I wonder why. As stated before, I would not rely on French and Chinese operators for the reasons mentioned.</p>
              <p>I am secretly hoping that the first package goes to a local service provider. I somehow feel SBST would be more fit given it has experience on Clementi/JE that is bulk of the services in this package. If not, I am rooting for the UK service provider. The service standard in UK buses, whether in London, Aberdeen or Scotland is quite good. </p>

              <p>No... we have to evaluate who has proper strategy and management of operations. The buses and drivers will not change irrespective of who the operator will be as the buses are provided by LTA and drivers will be local+some foreign hired.</p>
              <p>How they carry out their operations, their experience on different types of buses, the number of buses under operation need to be considered.</p>
              <p>For instance, take Paris as an example: it has a robust MRT network, just like Japan has. Buses are very few and mostly operated in the periphary. Would you say they have good experience even with SD/bendies? I would argue yes for France, not suitable for Singapore.</p>
              <p>UK operates a robust bus network just like Singapore, inspite of having a decent tube network. I would say they are better off. </p>

              <p>IMO, LTA might not award it to SBST because SBST is going to be the operator of the upcoming downtown line.

              <p>The first contract should have been experimental, with a smaller number of bus services. for instance: Only Bukit Batok services should have been given out. This way LTA would also learn about early hiccups and how to avoid it next time. How much ever they try, it will be difficult in the beginning like it is for anything that is new. You need time to put the processes and methods in place. By putting some of the high loading service from JE in first package, LTA is in risk of severe backlash. Lets hope for the best.</p>

              <p>Well, to minimize any disruption due to transition, LTA can consider asking the new bus operator to start running services weeks prior to take over - without displaying the numbers or collecting passengers. The new operator can realise and rectify flaws during these weeks, rather than only when it takes over. This way, we can ensure the new bus operator is ready to take over when the ccontract begins. <img style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Yes, I would agree that the UK operator will be more inclined to DDs. In London BB were withdrawn because of the fires and because they were hard to drive on the roads. Their roads were just too narrow and so the full length bendy bus was hard to drive. Their replacements are 2axle DD which is of course easier to turn. In sg case, our DDs are 3 axle and so its definitely harder to maneuvre as compared to a bendy bus, especially feeders. Therefore speed and efficiency is compromised. BTW I dont think articulated buses are extinct in UK, they were just withdrawn from london and to what I read before, these operators transferred these bendys to other states (correct me if I am wrong).</p>
              <p>Yes you are right, the need for articulated buses in the Bulim package is not so great except maybe in BBT because SBST has trained people on the DDs all their life. But imo, if an operator is going to better the services there in terms of efficiency,  it would be wise to propose articulated buses for the feeders in that package because for sg context,  articulated buses have performed well in feeders (London had no feeder routes). Whether that proposal is seen as an edge or not over others remains to be seen with LTAs view on Bendys.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, french and china operators are also Bendy/SD I believe</p>

              <p>In fact, Jinan Public Transportation Corporation has some experience of operating 2 axle DDs, but majority of buses in Jinan are still bendy/SDs.</p>

              <p>Look at the <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/about-lta/our-organisation.html">corporate structure of LTA</a> carefully.</p>
              <p>Safety and Contracts - <span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Provides comprehensive solutions for safety, time cost and environmental management for land transport system. They also oversee areas of safety and environmental management, planning and scheduling, </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">tender and procurement, contract management and administration</span></span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">, as well as cost control and monitoring to ensure that all projects are delivered safely, with excellent environmental management, on time, within budget and are value-for-money.</span></p>
              <p>The tender evaluation is not any-oh-how hamtum you know. With the tender evaluation arm being a distinct entity in itself within LTA, your allegations hardly hold water under typical circumstances.</p>
              <p>Govt slowness in dealing with these sorts of contracts is precisely due to need for "fairness". And what do you do? You accuse them of both being slow <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> unfair. Seemingly contradictory?</p>

              <p>If China can apply, HK surely can right!? HK was a British
