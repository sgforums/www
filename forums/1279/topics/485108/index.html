              <p>Hi mr SBS2601D, yes of course. But it will be minimized. Now we know the intentions of tendering for operators for peak hour services. It is just an experimental step to their bigger objectives. Cheers.</p>

                              still getting whacked by public, vs being able to do something, and
                              try to please the public.</p>
              <p>I think it makes a lot of sense.</p>

                              manage only the public in this model, rather than try to manage the
                              2 incumbents as well.</p>

              <p>So I think the twelve packages will be based on the twelve depots that will be around by the time this bus tendering thingy is completely introduced here, where the depots will be tendered out and whichever company that gets the contracts to operate the depot will run the bus services originating from the depot.</p>

              <p>I would suggest that u go read the press release again. N at the same time go look at the individual capacity of each bus depot before commenting.   N did u take into consideration of those dual depot service ? So sv7 will be operated maybe by sbst from bndep n maybe smrt from bbdep??? If not all services will switch to single depot instead??? </p>
