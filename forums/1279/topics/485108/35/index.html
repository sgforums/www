              <p>This is just an interim measure, they have sped up the process
              for restickering buses into the new PTV livery, its not just
              Transdev's fleet which has been restickered, but Ventura, CDC and
              several regional Victorian operators. How else do you want them to
              present their buses when the takeover (and transition to
              contract based system) has just occurred. Furthermore, while
              livery serves as an identifier for buses to the public,
              the main concern is still the operation of the buses, and it
              would take a while before relivery is completed. </p>
              <p>Admittedly they took slower than expected to resticker
              their buses to the new livery but there are no more bubble
              buses in Transdev's fleet with the Ventura blue livery, and most of
              the fleet has been done.</p>
              <p>Expect the same thing to occur for this Jurong East package.</p>

              <p>"This package may start with about 380 buses leased to the successful tenderer (also known as the “Operator”) in 2016, before growing to about 500 buses in 2021, in tandem with expected ridership growth and the development of Bukit Batok West and Tengah New Town." - <a href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=c645d50b-36ca-4cff-a6f7-38f5bcb5fa49">http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=c645d50b-36ca-4cff-a6f7-38f5bcb5fa49</a></p>
              <p>380 buses. to re-paint the entire 380 buses, I guess it will take around twelve months.</p>
              <p>btw, i am curious, just wondering, why cannot use Scania KUB buses? If so, the Mercedes-Benz OC500LE buses also cannot, since they are introduced at the same year as the Scania KUB buses.</p>
              <p>anyway, why cannot?</p>

              <p>It is a rather complicated process.</p>
              <p>I guess there will be at least one new bus procured by the LTA with the new common livery. I guess this new bus will be deployed to every bus service in the GCM package. When a bus is sent for re-painting, this new bus will be deployed in place of that bus.</p>

              <p>Giving tender to Tower Transit makes absolute sense. If you guys remember, I had correctly predicted this.</p>
              <p>It is not just the price. Tower Transit UK has good knowledge of bus operations, especially with DDs. Majority of its fleet is DD. So it was more obvious for me that it will get the tender than other companies who do not have much experience with DDs.</p>
              <p>SMRT bid was low yet did not make it because of its current standards not so good. SBST was a good contender, but then what is the whole deal with the tender if the current operator got it. I have a strong feeling that next tender Loyang will go to SBST.</p>

              <p>regarding the transition, because this is a new model, this involves a change of depots. </p>
              <p>how will operations of the 26 bus services be transferred to the new depot? on the very last day before this new model starts, will buses be sent to the new depot or the current depots? ....</p>
              <p>okay. I understand already. </p>
              <p>I guess this new contract will start on the night shift on last day of the current contract. at the last day after the buses completed their run, they will be sent to the new depot, where the new bus company will receive them, and begin the GCM contract the next day.</p>
              <p>hopefully, schedules can be arranged in collaboration with the existing bus companies (SBS Transit and SMRT), to ensure that during the week(s) when the transition takes place, the workers switching to the new company can have at least one day off-day.</p>
              <p>whereas for the buses, I guess the transfer of ownership to the LTA wil take place gradually before the transition, from SBS Transit / SMRT to the LTA. Some paper work and transactions here.</p>
              <p>actually, for the buses, my concern is on the feeder bus services. will they use double decker or articulated bus? </p>
              <p>I guess before the very last night when buses move from the current depots to the new depot, there will be new buses there already. To be exact, it's 380 minus 290, 90 new buses.</p>

              <p>I guess it takes around 7 days to remove the existing livery and
              to paint a new livery.</p>
              <p>On the assumption that there is only one paint station, if it
              takes 7 days to re-paint a bus, it would take 2660 days (7.3889
              years) to re-paint 380 buses.</p>
              <p>To re-paint 380 buses in one year (365 days), we need 7.2877 (8)
              paint stations re-painting buses at the same time.</p>
              <p>If 8 paint stations re-paint 8 buses in 7 days, we only need
              47.5 weeks (332.5 days) to re-paint 380 buses.</p>

              <p>Like what carbikebus said, most of the new buses now have stickered liveries. Very few of them (like for a few CDGE B9TLs) are in painted livery. Relatively simple to sticker a new livery now. </p>

              <p>Giving tender to Tower Transit makes absolute sense. If you guys
                  remember, I had correctly predicted this.</p>
              <p>It is not just the price. Tower Transit UK has good knowledge of
                  bus operations, especially with DDs. Majority of its fleet is DD.
                  So it was more obvious for me that it will get the tender than
                  other companies who do not have much experience with DDs.</p>
              <p>SMRT bid was low yet did not make it because of its current
                  standards not so good. SBST was a good contender, but then what is
                  the whole deal with the tender if the current operator got it. I
                  have a strong feeling that next tender Loyang will go to SBST.</p>

              <p>They will worry a lot less. LTA intends to bring in one to two more bus operators.</p>

              <p>good idea. </p>
              <p>maybe we can have different shades of red, from red to white, or from white to red.</p>
              <p>just wondering, would pink colour be a good colour for public bus livery? hot pink colour. bright and positive.</p>
              <p>then inside the interior is pink colour...</p>
              <p>wouldn't it be pretty looking? :)</p>
