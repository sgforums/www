So what if several routes duplicate the CCL for several stations? Do you know that the distance between CCL stations is rather far and dont forget there are people living @ places BETWEEN CCL stations. don't be so myopic as to suggest chopping just because a route duplicates other stuff. like that can chop svc 2 since it runs from outram park mrt right up to Tanah Merah mrt izzit?<br><br>buses serve to complement the rail network and toprovide alternative links to other places. do your homework, visit the CCL areas and think before making comments that are uncalled for.</div>
