Don't think SBS Transit will give a damn about people who want to go from say Hougang Ave 2 to Hougang Ave 9... They'll just force people to take 132 to Hougang Central to change to 72 or 325... Anyway for 151, think once it turns left from Upp Serangoon Rd (i.e. like 72), it'll reach Hougang Ave 3 already... It'll not go through Hougang Ave 2... Also I think 51 likely to go by your suggested 151 amended route because it's already got a long journey and it would be preferable to turn in to Hougang Central ASAP instead of going by a slightly longer route via Hougang stadium and Hougang Ave 10... But then again, it's not confirmed that all these 3 trunk services will be relocated to Hougang Central... The press release said most will probably be, so there's still the possibility that some might be extended to say Sengkang or Punggol (51 very unlikely though).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking if there is enough space to accomodate all the current routes at Hougang South.

This provides a link between Sengkang and MacPherson. It is somewhat like the case of SBST 156's extension from Serangoon Int to Sengkang Int.<br><br>SERVICE 321: Withdrawn.

I think this is very unlikely... If SBS Transit key aim is to provide a link to Kovan MRT from Hougang Ave 2 (from Hougang stadium onwards to before Serangoon North, i.e. near the tunnel), they can just extend 132 to Serangoon instead... In fact, I think SBS Transit would rather get people to take a bus to Hougang Central and take the NEL to Kovan instead of being so nice and providing people along Hougang Ave 2 and Hougang Ave 7 with direct links to Kovan.<br><br>Isn't a bad idea to extend 151 to Sengkang as it also provides NUS students living in Sengkang a direct link...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SBS Transit did promise to help out the shopkeeers and tenants at Hougang South to some extent after the interchange has closed. So i believe that SBST 132 will be the service that will ply the area after the bus interchange has closed down. Why? A lot of the customer base for Hougang South also comes from Ang Mo Kio and a lot of Ang Mo Kio residents do shop at Hougang South (or else they wouldn't have kept SBST 132 there for so long with VOs running), not counting those living on the NEL and taking trains. So i believe that a detour it may be to turn into Hougang St 21, it is still the logical move. A lot were also expecting it to pass by Kovan on its way to Serangoon Int, but i believe Serangoon is too crowded and is not a good "passenger catchment" area until the sub-regional centre is up some years later. so it has to turn back to Hougang Central.<br><br>it is a good thing to hear that there are enough spaces to accomodate, in Hougang Central, the services from Hougang South. but i suppose SBS Transit will make use of this chance to rid the feeder services and remove redundancy. after all, why they pursued so hard to have feeder services' fares be on par with that of trunk services? they got now get ppl to take 62, 72, 74, 82, 88, 159 and so on to get around the town. i suppose if there's 7 spaces available, not extending SBST 151 to Sengkang Int will still mean only 4 out of 7 spaces are taken and that's rather "comfortable" for the Hougang South services to settle down there. but i think one trunk service should end up in Sengkang or Punggol, and SBST 151 is the best candidate for this, even if we have to squeeze jus one more service in the crowded Sengkang Interchange or having to go that extra mile to the far-away Punggol Int. and if it's Sengkang, it could most probably share the berth with 80 and 86.<br><br>regarding the situation of crowding at Sengkang Interchange, they could let services plying the bus stop at Sengkang East Way jus outside Compass Point (SBST 156 and 159), which is sheltered all the way into Compass Point and Sengkang Interchange, to allow boarding only from there instead of inside the interchange.</div>

So i believe that SBST 132 will be the service that will ply the area after the bus interchange has closed down. Why? A lot of the customer base for Hougang South also comes from Ang Mo Kio and a lot of Ang Mo Kio residents do shop at Hougang South (or else they wouldn't have kept SBST 132 there for so long with VOs running), not counting those living on the NEL and taking trains. So i believe that a detour it may be to turn into Hougang St 21, it is still the logical move. A lot were also expecting it to pass by Kovan on its way to Serangoon Int, but i believe Serangoon is too crowded and is not a good "passenger catchment" area until the sub-regional centre is up some years later. so it has to turn back to Hougang Central.</div></blockquote>Well what makes you think SBS will follow up on its promise?
