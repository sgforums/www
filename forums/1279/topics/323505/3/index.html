              <p>Perhaps the bus companies here should take out the unpredictability in taking buses. That would solve many problems. Ultimately the objective is have a very dependable system - such that cars are absolutely not necesary at all.</p>

              <p>Strongly agree with you. I think costs of the cityshopper service is a major impediment to higher demand and utilisation of the cityshopper services.

              <p><br> Disagree. NEL also sees high loading during peak hour. If they want
              people to convert to public transport, they need to minimise such
              peak hour squeeze into NEL trains.</p>
              <p>They should have realised by now, the NEL rationalisation
              exercise of 2003 was much of a mistake. NEL's peak hour loads is
              definitely comparable to NSL's, if not more.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But I disagree with you, NSL has way higher loads than NEL, truth is, I can't board a Northbound train during PM peak at Yio Chu Kang (don't even think of Novena or Toa Payoh) but I can still board NEL (with a bit of squeezing) at Dhoby Ghaut during PM Peak. I must say that the NSL and EWL rationalisation, which saw old services like 3, 4, 8, 28, 104, 134, 140, 141, 146, 148, 163 (scaled back), 168 gone among a host of others (let those older bus fans say cos I dunno all) were greater in terms of impact than the NEL one.</p>
              <p>Also do note that you can start getting seats by the time NEL reaches Kovan, or even Serangoon during PM peak, and for NSL during the same time, forget about it unless you kena a train which is behind a late one.</p>

              <p>actually, there is still along way 2 go before the MRT lines are ready. By the time these MRT lines are ready, many bus services will be introduced and withdrawn. Maybe LTA change plan 2 make more ppl take public transport?</p>
