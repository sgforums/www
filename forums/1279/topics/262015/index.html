            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Tuesday June 19, 12:17 PM</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Many rides, one fare?</span></strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: Fancy paying a flat fee as you hop from buses to trains to get from Ang Mo Kio to Clementi? That could be a reality, if the Government takes up a suggestion mooted to make public transport more attractive to Singaporeans.<br><br>The flat fee Â— or through fare Â— allows commuters to make multiple transfers between buses and trains, saving travel time and cost.<br><br>Describing it as a suggestion Â“to be consideredÂ”, Minister of State for Transport Lim Hwee Hua said a Â“multi-pronged approachÂ” is needed in the ongoing land transport review, in which the Transport Ministry and the Land Transport Authority have organised brain-storming sessions to elicit suggestions.<br><br>And ideas, ranging from the routine to the radical, have poured in from various stakeholders, including members of the public, over the past two months.<br><br>Some suggested raising Electronic Road Pricing surcharges further to ease congestion in the city, while others wanted the Government to build a brand-new expressway over the current Central Expressway.<br><br>On the latter, Ms Lim cautioned against building more roads to accommodate the projected 6.5 million population. Ms Lim said the review Â“still has a few more months to goÂ” and that all the feedback obtained will be looked into.<br><br>More roads, she said, would create Â“a latent demandÂ”, especially in city areas. Roads may seem congestion-free at first Â— and this may lead to even more cars using them. This will, in the end, create further congestion, she said at the wrapup session yesterday.<br><br>Associate Professor K Raguraman, an expert on transport policy at the National University of Singapore, agreed with Ms Lim. Â“Building more roads will only serve a small target group,Â” he said.<br><br>Instead, Assoc Prof Raguraman suggested that more rail lines be laid. He cited Hong Kong and Seoul, where the high public transport usage has led to a developed train network that is the preferred mode of transport.<br><br>Last night, participants also debated the vehicle growth rate Â— which has been 3 per cent annually for the past 10 years.<br><br>Dr Paul Barter, an expert on public transport at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, previously suggested that a Certificate of Entitlement should expire when a vehicle clocks a certain mileage, rather than when it is 10 years old. People would then drive judiciously and minimise congestion, he said.<br><br>Others said taxes for car owners should be revised. Rather than paying a flat road tax, car owners should be taxed according to mileage, they argued. Taxes should also be increased for those who own second or third cars.<br><br>Perennial complaints of long waiting times for buses and taxis also cropped up. Mrs Lim said the review will examine the allocation of resources during peak periods.<br><br>But she disagreed that taxis should pay lower ERP charges. Taxis, she said, are similar to cars as they, too, contribute to congestion. Instead, taxi fares and surcharges can be raised to reduce the demand for them during peak periods, she added.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the fare system we use in ZYXbus is the pure definition of through fare:<br><br>Commuters take up to 5 buses with transfers but pay for one entire bus ride. limit is 5 bus.<br><br>for example u go from Jurong east to boon lay<br>u take bus ZYX335 out then transfer ZYX194. the route u travel is via jurong town hall rd then boon lay way. So u pay for only the route u travelled which in this case should be around 13 stages which is 85 cents rather than 105 cents with the trasnfer rebate of current pay system.<br><br>u cannot cheat the system also because  say u saddist n take<br><br>bus ZYX335 out to chiniese garden then bus ZYX Airport express 57 into yuan ching area.then u go and takeb us ZYX30 headed for bedok out to the highway AYE then take bus ZYX178 back to jurong east.u think u pay 4 stage fare? no lah.<br><br>the system has tracked u trasnferring at those bus stop n will add up the entire route u took...lalalala which is in this case...biggy circle.<br><br>thats through fare lor<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I feel that a system-wide $1.90 fare cap might be good enough. Which means that if one takes a SMRT feeder out to transfer a SMRT train, followed by a SBST trunk would still only cost $1.90. Or a SBST bus - NEL - SBST again also only $1.90. However, I forsee a huge problem in deciding how much each operator gets out of a trip (the split between SMRT &amp; SBST for NEL-NSL/EWL transfers is confusing &amp; mysterious enough).<br><br>Currently only SBST offers that on their basic bus services and its very useful in cutting travel costs (can combine several trips into one journey). While SPH insists that the 1% of the travelling population only depends on it and hence its not worth impementing...</div>
