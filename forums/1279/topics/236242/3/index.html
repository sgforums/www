            <div class='col-md body'>you must acknowledge that not even one entire brand new bus can equate the life of one passenger. The bus is made to protect the most important occupant and that's YOU! The BC is also trained to protect the most important customer and that's YOU! So if he gets scolded for being too slow but drives at the speed he is most confident which ensures your 100% safety, it will be really worthwhile. Although SBST has a profit to maintain, your safety is my business. There are many things despite receiving rude remarks, I still cannot budge. For example the door opening/closing timing &amp; speedlimiter. Because it may benefit that person but jeopardises another person's life.</div>

It is also about the BC and the other road users. When he's slow, probably he's driving through difficult winding places, unexpecting traffic conditions or a jam. The quality of the trip is not only about being quick &amp; on time. It is about being safe. If the BC has to be late &amp; safe or fast &amp; not really safe, I believe the choice is very clear.</div>

Everytime when the bus travels along the mandai area, the buzzer always sound. Wonder how the BC tolerate the buzzer. Wah! Imagine you were the BC and you needed the toilet urgently and you keep hearing the buzzer sound, coupled with the passenger noise and aircon noise, feels like hell! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
