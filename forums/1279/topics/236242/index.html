            <div class='col-md body'>Today I was on SBS 0388H serving on Service 22. I was carrying quite a lot of things: a school bag, a sling bag to put my file, a water bottle and also I was carrying my buy back lunch. Then at the T-junction outside the petrol station and a school in Tampines, the traffic light turned red. The bus suddenly slowed down so fast that I almost fell (again). Wow! It overshot the crossing by just a few metres.<br><br>I also remember getting onto a Townlink 293 bus SBS 0711H, which I mentioned earlier. The BC was so fast that I nearly fell. And that happened for two consecutive days and at the same time of the day.<br><br>SMRT could be even worse. Their BC speed so fast. Just recently I took TIB 0580A on Service 67. The BC can just speed even without knowing that I almost fell. I also remember one, also on Service 67. The BC could speed even at sharp turns, like the one outside Bedok Reservior and a condominium.<br><br>What happened to both bus companies? SBS Transit promised to keep their buses below 60km/h, yet we got fast buses (good for some of you). SMRT is worse, nearly every BC speed. And probably they don't know I'm carrying very heavy things. Somemore I am exhausted carrying heavy things, yet they give us trouble (may not really be).<br><br>Anyone can explain why?</div>
