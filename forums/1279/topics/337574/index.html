              <p>My 3 worst services in no particular order of penalty. I can't think of the other 2 as yet.</p>
              <p>1) <strong>Svc 97</strong>. Direct service from JEC to Vivocity but the bus frequency sucks big time during off-peak hours.</p>
              <p>2) <strong>Svc 30</strong>. A service with lots of looping here and there especially in the Boon Lay area. Imagine you see the bus-interchange in front of your very own eyes but the bus just weave in and out of the minor roads, as if the BC is playing a prank on you.</p>
              <p>3) <strong>Express 506.</strong> Not a very express service<strong>. </strong>There are a significant number of bus-stops the bus has to commit along its routes.</p>

              <p>Mine... Got a few.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SBST Sv. ___:</p>
              <p>15</p>
              <p>Waiting time can vary like mad... It being a long loop service doesn't help!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>23</p>
              <p>Same as 15</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>27</p>
              <p>Should split into 2 sv. One goes exclusive Tp and other Hgang. Capacity crunch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>31</p>
              <p>Morning peak and around 2p.m at Bdok is madness. Other times DD bus can empty one... Schedule has major problems. ITE East after 7a.m got so much people yet still use that (OMG)single-deck Mercz... Walao they mad ah...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>34</p>
              <p>Also morning peak capacity crunch. 20 min interval for an airport plying bus service? No thanks!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>69</p>
              <p>Serves TPoly yet poor choice of equipment. Should have full DD instead of mixed single and double deckers. It also serves Tampines Ave 8 which is not very high yielding(Not many . Route should be amended to serve Tampines St 83(higher density) and Ave 3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>72</p>
              <p>Critical link between Tp Int and Tampines Ave 9. This stretch is packed to the max during morning and evening peak.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Townlink 291</p>
              <p>West loop critically underserved coz of structure of road linkage in Tampines. Lots of people take this service in morning and evening to go to Tp Int. Should deploy DDs on peak periods. Have seen people coz of capacity crunch take sv. 69 instead. Not a good situation, really.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Townlink 293</p>
              <p>West loop. Exact same as townlink 291 and route is weird.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT Sv.___:</p>
              <p>67</p>
              <p>Route is too long and occasional infrequent. Morning and evening peak need higher frequency and more buses between Bedok Reservoir and Bendemeer Road. Short-working service perharps?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>969</p>
              <p>Occasional infrequent and always jam packed by time bus reaches Yishun Station/Khatib station for Tp Int. Higher frequency with more bendies should be used.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Verdict for the 5 most disliked bus services?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SBST sv. 27, 31, 291, 293</p>

              <p>Why you all hate sv 3 so much =(<br><br>One thing is turn here and there. But you have to see, it was extended to Punggol because maybe they wanted a quick link from Pasir Ris to Punggol. Yes there is sv 34 from Tampines to Punggol, which is much faster. Look at 294, it was duplicating too much of 291's east loop, and 357 which at one time was plying Loyang Ave, so why not combine them to ply both routes since they only have 2 roads separating them? (Loyang Ave and Tampines Ave 7)</p>
              <p>Ever since 21 was amended to St Michael's, there hasn't been a direct link to Tamp Int from Pasir Ris Int. 21 has crappy frequency, so to distribute the load from Tampines to Pasir Ris a new service had to be born. Actually from Tampines Ave 7 (opp Tamp JC), a sv 3 bus may only be 1 or 2 mins behind a sv 21 bus if they started out at the same time.<br><br>I know it's biased =P</p>
