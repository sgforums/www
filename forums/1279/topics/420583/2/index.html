              <p><br>It is not wrong to have any discussions as long as sensitive information is not leaked here. But it seems in the previous thread, many of what is not supposed to be leaked are already said. I don't know the rationale of moderator to lock the previous thread but most likely the previous discussion have reached to a point that it might get the threadstarter and other innocent parties into trouble.</p>
              <p>If the moderators say lock, then just stop for the moment. Why is there the need to give the moderators and the forum trouble by being stubborn? This is to prevent other troublemakers to cause trouble to the people who work in the respective companies by leaking whatever information. Maybe threadstarter has no intention to cause trouble, but there are many troublemakers who are just too stubborn. Since the buses are already here and there is a new service amendment to KTPH coming up, these buses will be registered soon. Why not wait till then discuss?</p>

              <p><br>I get really upset when previously somone's kind intentions was regarded as plain stupidity. If you think that someone has been doing the wrong thing, then you can just stop him, instead of giving him trouble and break his ricebowl. Someone wants to be a "good saint" and act smart, do something destructive and instead of being grateful to this kind soul who wants to share information, he gets this person into deep trouble and make his life difficult.</p>
              <p>Now good, everything just have to be monitored more closely now, because of some troublemaker's selfishness, stupidity and irresponsibility. And no more exclusive informations in future because of this. I rarely want to insult personally but that guy must really be a jerk.</p>
              <p>Good, all the moderators must be firm on this issue from now on!</p>

              They spotted it with their own eyes. Is it wrong to post it on

              legally seen and were publicly viewable. Is there anything wrong

              <p>original TS leaked out information on its whereabouts, leading to people snapping it. the company cannot deal with the public, but they can deal with him.</p>
              <p>there is no grey area about this. some things are publicly viewable or published, yet the act of an insider making the viewable become more viewable is still an offensive act.</p>
              <p>TS has been advised to remove the pictures. it may help to mitigate if he gets called up to explain.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">So here's my plan. I'll give you 48 hours for everyone to remove anything and everything that could possibly implicate the former TS. Tell him to remove it, beg anyone else to remove the info, I dont care, just get it done.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">After that, I would expect to be able to discuss about the citaros freely and without anybody thinking that I am trying to implicate anyone else.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There needs to be an end to this, and I am sorry if it seemed that I was out to cause any trouble.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">let's reach a compromise. The only thing we wanted was to discuss about the citaros, but now we cant because some guy decided to leak out info.</p>

              <p>If you are really sincere about this, no discussion of new Citaros until the first day of revenue service.</p>

              <p>Guys, my advise is please stop all arguments. Fact is that Citaros already arrived, and TS saw it when passing by. Previous thread already locked by mod and pics are already advised by mod to be removed. This thread does not have any pics, so why not we just continue to discuss on this topic other than flaming instead? Cool down man.</p>
              <p>2 cents worth. :)</p>
