              <p>No doubt they do have the highest accident/incident records in London, however, u might be surprised to know that the citaro and the citaro g has exactly the same turning circle by specification.</p>
              <p>There's nothing to be said if the drivers arnt trained for the use of the buses, because if keisei bus can use them on roads as narrow as london in chiba, japan, no reason they cant be used in london if adequate training is given. Negotiating a turn with a articulated vehicle is not the same as with a rigid.</p>

              <p>Consider that the city of London is very old, dating back centuries. Most of the roads there were originally build for horse-carts and such; when some of the roads were built, even the simplest motor vehicles seemed like a wild fantasy. The oldest roads probably date back as far back as the 17th century, built after the Great London Fire of <em>1666</em>. Some roads are probably even older than that.</p>
              <p>London's roads were never really built for long vehicles such as a bendy bus. With bendy buses, they sometimes block side roads when stopped at certain bus stops, and the turning radius allowed for some roads and road junctions is just simply too small for such a long vehicle. Many of the roads are probably also very narrow (remember, again - some of these roads were probably built before motor vehicles existed), which can present additional problems for a bendy bus. Cyclists also find it more difficult to overtake a bendy bus because of it's length - I personally have experienced it.</p>

              <p>Hi. Just to clarify, I have publicly asked LTA during a meeting, in the presence of some SMRT staff, if bendy quota is set. However, LTA says that they are willing to permit more bendies if the demand is there. Therefore it has to be like a proposal sent in by SMRT to LTA then there will be evaluations. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>They are planning in future to convert to full single deck fleets for better frequncies and also lesser space crunch in their depots and interchange operations. Moreover, they also planning for the new deployment demands once the Bukit Timah MRT line is ready in future and thus may need lesser or even axe bendy buses after that.</p>

              <p><br>LTA will not approve the Capacity due the length, that's for sure.</p>
              <p>There are many cheaper brands to buy other than Mercedes Benz for bendy buses and SMRT has already spend extra money/budget to get Citaro single deckers. That's why they trial the MAN and Zhongtong, as most likely candidates.</p>
              <p>One thing for sure, LTA has limit the number of bendy buses each company can buy. Even if SBST wants to buy them in future, they can also buy in small fleets. So what for spend so much extra money to buy such small fleets in future? They can spend more money instead to buy more single deckers to improve the frequncies instead, else just go for double deckers.</p>
