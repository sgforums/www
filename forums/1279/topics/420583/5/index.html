              <p>DDs. Believe it or not. Looking at Singapore's current traffic flow, especially Orchard Rd, Eu Tong Sen St and etc, u think LTA would want more bendies to come in to SG? I dun think so. So many SLs are rumoring about LTA banning bendies alr. And yes, I mean MANY.</p>

              <p>I think u have to understand the history before bashing the vehicles, the vehicles got burned down because of a flaw in design which placed fuel lines too near the turbocharger. This flaw has long been repaired and there has been no subsequent fires due to this.</p>
              <p>The reason behind why london is removing bendies is because of politics, and motorists complains about them taking too much road space. Not because of the fires. As of now, there are still Citaro Gs running around london itself. The remaining routemasters are being used on sightseeing/tourist routes only, not on proper services for the general travelling public.</p>
              <p>I would kindly suggest u get the facts correct before posting and misleading other users in this forum.</p>

              this.</p>
              <p>The reason behind why london is removing bendies is because of
              politics, and motorists complains about them taking too much road
              space. Not because of the fires. As of now, there are still Citaro
              Gs running around london itself. The remaining routemasters are
              being used on sightseeing/tourist routes only, not on proper
              services for the general travelling public.</p>
              <p>I would kindly suggest u get the facts correct before posting
              and misleading other users in this forum.</p>

              <p>DDs. Believe it or not. Looking at Singapore's current traffic

              would want more bendies to come in to SG? I dun think so. So many

              I think that the new batch of Citaros doesnt use the OM906 engine as its only Euro IV complied right?The new batch should be OM475HLA 12 litres Euro V/EEV
              
              Seriously i dun think SMRTBuses is interested in buying DDs.The most i should say they sell or scrap their Euro I bendies and buy WAB bendies in small units ie:60 scrap/35 buy..With upcoming rail lines think 25% of the bus paxs sure take rail lines..Discuss with a reliable sources(Not SL/Timekeeper).They will wait and see for the CCL to operate progressively.Think SMRT should reduce their bendies and concentrate more on buying rigids.I feel that in 3 years time there will be numbers of bendies sold/scrapped in huge numbers ie 100 old bendies and probably 50 new bendies/50 new rigids.That way it fulfill LTA demand on reducing bendies.LTA DO NOT BAN bendies its up to the operator themselves...

              <p>The previous mayor of london promoted the use of the bendy buses, however when his term ended, the current mayor declared a "war" on bendy buses. This is politics at work in its clearest form.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't comment if the streets of London are too narrow, but the bus companies have to know which roads are wide enough to put a bendy there before purchasing them in bulk.</p>
              <p>Apologies for not making it clear, what i meant was the routemasters in use for revenue service in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">london</span> are for tourist/heritage routes only (rt 9 &amp; 15). There is however still routemasters in use for revenue service outside of london.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right. I went to London 2 years back and they call bendy buses as killer buses because the roads in London are too narrow for the buses to turn, and these buses usually bang the kerb where pedestrains are waiting to cross the road, killing them instantly.</p>
