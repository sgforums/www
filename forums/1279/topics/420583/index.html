              <p>People spotted the bus on a public road or from a public road. They spotted it with their own eyes. Is it wrong to post it on here? Is there some kind of lockdown of information or something?</p>
              <p>I know some people are stupid enough to leak information out and get themselves in hot soup, but I'm sure there's none of that happening in the present situation at hand. The vehicles were legally seen and were publicly viewable. Is there anything wrong with discussing it here?</p>

              <p>In the first place, he just mentioned he saw the buses in Pasir Panjang harbour but he did not dare to post any pictures. But he shouldn't have said too much about these buses, which cause many of these troublemakers go all the way to the dealer premises, secretly take pictures without permissions. Never mind, they even dare to post them in the open internet and said too much information about the buses, which is not even supposed to say out.</p>
