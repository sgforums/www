              Look at the past posts by TIB868X, dan474 and the rest. Or you are
              half asleep as the moderator. The sole moderator with all the
              power. Read the photos thread two months ago,and since you have
              facebook, look at them too.</p>

              <p>I don't have your Facebook, it's blocked. And I'm not going to take sides between the both of you, lest you accuse me of being partial to any party. I'm just going to make clear that this is almost like backstabbing and these guys should also realise it.</p>
              <p>And I don't have dan474 on my friends' list on Facebook too, as far as you are concerned about this. I definitely welcome it if you would like to argue or trash this one-on-one here, but to involve his social circle is probably too much. How he wants to lead his life, you may have influence but you do not have absolute authority. I think we've gone as far as to leave you alone, please spare a thought for others.</p>

                      <p>Look, given what grudges you think I have against you, anything that is moderated (that does not involve me) can easily to twisted to seem partial to whoever is your opposing side. The best part is, I'm out of touch with what you are doing with your friends and foes, and I do not wish to be involved. This is something you can settle within yourselves, if the Police can help you so be it, I'm not the one who can help in the end. My moderation will not help, and I assure you I read the forums very actively but <b>if there is nothing that cannot be solved amongst yourselves I will let you fight here, rather than to start involving other parties in the argument who are, literally, not a party to it.</b> Impartial enough?</p>

              to do, you should have read me posting a warning regarding

              <p>You're trying to implement a flamewar here. Is that you trying to dash across and snap that MAN A24@ST Kinnetics. Or did you sent someone there and you masterminded the whole thing yourself? It's better you go to jail as you're raging everyone including that 'citaro hugger'. I think we should all take a vote and decide whether to request FireIce to issue a ban to you like ghost_79, which scared us all saying only can take citaro and wright pictures. Or are you him, or SBS1000U? And what nonsense is tamago having, spouting bus nonsense and you're threatening him to report him to the police? Man, you can be charged. I hope ST Kinnetics catches you and sents you to jail, you'll get slapped with another charge. Plus TIB868X can be sacarstic sometimes, but you're the one abusing the power of the internet and cyberbulling instead. Plus you think the police jia ba bo taiji ze, come settle your bus problem? Please lah, police need to write report on cases not like you, only know how to whack here and create problem to let everyone flame.</p>
