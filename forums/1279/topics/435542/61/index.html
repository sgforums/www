              quite dependent on the supervisor also. some drivers really inform minor stuff like minor damage to the bodywork and it was fixed 2 days later. SMRT AMDEP buses are the most horribly maintained buses buses in SMRT's fleet.
              
              from what i heard KJDEP depot supervisor made it compulsory for SLs to clean their buses daily too. the missing readers on bendies case, probably depot waiting for new readers to come in before replacing.
