              <p>Just to let you know how this board is damn inaccurate...</p>
              <p>170 : <br>Bus arrived upon showing 2mins. <br>Another one arrive when the board shows 4mins.<br>Arrival timing shows 2 buses coming at the same time, and yes there's 2 buses at the same time. <br>Above 16 and 31 mins were inaccurate then. At least 2 buses came(for 2 diff directions) and the waiting time isn't up till 16mins.</p>
              <p>856/903 :<br>Bus arrive when the panel shows 2mins.</p>
              <p>912 :<br>Machine was off afterwards, and on again. It shows 4mins for 912, and it stays as 4 mins when 5mins on the clock passes. No changes also.</p>
              <p>913 :<br>Bus arrived when it shows 5mins, thereafter the 5mins changes to 7mins.</p>
              <p>911 :<br>Only saw 1 Arrival accurately, afterwards, the timing wasn't accurate already.</p>
              <p><br> Tbh, this is the worst arrival timing board I've seen, perhaps it's there for only 1-2 days. And no bias against which operators here, because both can't even keep the proper standard, not even SBS Transit.</p>

              Something that I always been wondering... 
              
              I ever waited 12 mins for S911 before at 6pm to Woodlands Centre... The queue was still ok... but along the way, I only saw another 1 S911 at St 13 heading towards the Int... That's the only 911 bus spotted. So where's the 4 - 6 mins headways? 
              
              This is the evening peak hours...
              
              Dun tell me what school bus jamming up the road grandfather story.. that's later towards 7pm... 
              
              So, just where's the jam? Is the school bus problem just amplifying or an cause of it?
              
              As for runtime issue... go look at what happened to KMB when they didn't do the runtime and scheduling properly last year... Which is why you can only have more but not for less...

              <p>You should go study the whole area for months before telling me this. Let alone 911, other buses heading to CIQ also have cockup frequency.</p>
              <p>And you sure school bus jamming starts around 7? Then explain to me why I often see them lining up when it's around late 5pm to around 6:30pm? Let alone the jam, there's also high loading along Wdl Centre Rd, no fixed traffic light from St13 turning to Town Garden.</p>
              <p>Also, during evening peak, there's already like down to 5 911 running for both sides. S201 already converted to 911E, 1 having break. Obviously CIQ side have lesser demands compared to st82/83.</p>
              <p>So how can you even expect a 4-6mins frequency when you're towards CIQ? Further more, I don't even know where you get the value. Don't forget the frequency starts from St83/82 side, not CIQ. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you want to blame, you can only blame the tight schedule. By right, 95% of 911's driver are all on time, except for 1-2 whom drive slowly. </span></p>

              <p>170 :<br> Bus arrived upon showing 2mins.<br> Another one arrive when the board shows 4mins.<br> Arrival timing shows 2 buses coming at the same time, and yes
              there's 2 buses at the same time.<br> Above 16 and 31 mins were inaccurate then. At least 2 buses
              came(for 2 diff directions) and the waiting time isn't up till
              16mins.</p>
              <p>856/903 :<br> Bus arrive when the panel shows 2mins.</p>
              <p>912 :<br> Machine was off afterwards, and on again. It shows 4mins for 912,
              and it stays as 4 mins when 5mins on the clock passes. No changes
              also.</p>
              <p>913 :<br> Bus arrived when it shows 5mins, thereafter the 5mins changes to
              7mins.</p>
              <p>911 :<br> Only saw 1 Arrival accurately, afterwards, the timing wasn't
              accurate already.</p>
              <p><br>  Tbh, this is the worst arrival timing board I've seen,
              perhaps it's there for only 1-2 days. And no bias against which
              operators here, because both can't even keep the proper standard,
              not even SBS Transit.</p>

              <p>Did you know that the owner of (buses[IN]gapore!) and his gang is famous for defaming people publicly on their Page?</p>
              <p>An incident which happened a few weeks ago, when a bus company at Hong Kong bought a MAN NL323F. Apparently the owner of (buses[IN]gapore!) aka Mark Chua Yong Xiang thinks it is right for him to reupload a photo of it on his Page without asking for permission.</p>
              <p>After the owner of the photo, Mr Ying Hang Tin, asked him politely to take it down because Mark did not sought his permission beforehand to reupload, Mark went on to argue why it was okay it reupload the photo and give him credits for it, when the website where the photo is found explictly stated that nobody is welcomed to use any material from the website without seeking permission from the photographer beforehand, in this case, Mr Tin.</p>
              <p>After arguing with Mr Tin, he screenshot the post with Mr Tin's and his comment, and continue insisting that Mr Tin was rude with his comment, when it was Mark Chua arguing back that it is the same as sharing the photo from another Page.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Mark Chua thinks that reuploading the photo to his own Page and give credits, but without permission and sharing the photo from another Page is the same. And the post with the original picture on (buses[IN]gapore!) was promptly removed by Facebook for copyright infrigement.</p>
              <p>Screenshot below:</p>
              <p><img id="preview-img" class="content-shadow" src="https://photos-1.dropbox.com/t/0/AACBxTSNEPmxLk47Jr8qHENaSLoQ0N5hmg-nl42ooBNxwg/12/29999820/png/1024x768/3/1365087600/0/2/Untitled.png/2-q4Xr0Z7nP_lAVjEBHw4ZI1VcM-GYhdvpD11zuRcmc" alt=""></p>
              <p>Another example:</p>
              <p>A few years ago, when Mark Chua and gang apparently was unhappy with another forum group called SPT, they set up a Page called "The SPT Daily, Trivialised", posting extremely crude and defamatory comments about them everyday, until it got deleted by Facebook one day.</p>
              <p>I wished I had screenshots of this dirty act of theirs, unfortunately I do not.</p>
              <p>Well now, he decides to publicly defame Singapore Buses which did nothing to harm or defame (buses[IN]gapore!). They were merely making a comment, but if the shoe fits, fell free to wear it.</p>
              <p>Apparently the shoe fits for Mark Chua.</p>
