              each app has its pros and cons, unfortunately im using android so idk how is the smrt app. but the sbst app sucks, it lags and hangs frequently and rarely determines the correct location. im better off using a third party app which has both companies svcs and much more reliable (rarely hangs, smooth, good UI). stop fanboying over sbst. youre just like aviation fans fanboying about boeing everywhere and slam airbus everytime. 
              <br>
              sure, SBST is better than SMRT in some aspects but they have their own flaws too. stop making baseless assumptions about how shitty SMRT is. check your facts before ypu post. doesnt mean people dont have the same thought as you means that they are wrong and you are correct.

              <p>Other private bus companies might not have a fleet as large as SMRT's at RWS disposal that can cope with the loading. What for RWS wastes money buying 15 buses which they might not need it anymore in the future?</p>
