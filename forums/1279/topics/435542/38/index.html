              <p>One of the trio moderator edited my post regarding on this mess, but not editing or moderating SMB228X and their clones that caused the problem for 6 months. Effective non-existent moderation, allowing the spams and rubbish to continue or moderators are in cahoots with the clone accounts?<br><br>Do not start saying i spike the football on SMB228X and the clones, if you had done your homework, nobody in this forum liked their nonsense and no effective moderation was done. Discussions had to continue with all these trolls.</p>

              Maybe the clones were part of <em>your</em> scheme hence the lack
              of effort to even moderate properly? Making up excuses to cover up
              your ineffective moderating. I am not the person looking after this
              forum, I am sure it is your responsibility to combat the issues

              <p>Well, if I engaged with the trolls we'll see much more posts than this amount you're getting. This problem was never new, but then the root of the problem always involve the people creating them. If there is no unity, you guys will be fighting all the day long in any public forum, and suddenly it seemed like the moderators are the ones responsible for what users say? Moderators are not editors, and nobody is going to lose a hair ignoring trolls and their meaningless speeches. Don't feed the troll.</p>
