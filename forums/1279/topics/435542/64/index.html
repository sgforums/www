              <p>The root of the issue is that the scale of bus ops for SMRT is insufficient to reap cross-subsidisation the way SBST can.</p>

              <p>Cost side, SMRT can quite probably do better in reducing them.</p>
              <p>Again, if it wants to reduce costs, one way is to ditch bendies, because if SMRT is indeed looking to DDs as it makes sense, then there really is little point in keeping bendies in the fleet anymore for the sake of homogenisation.</p>

              <p>I dont know where the higher costs come from also.</p>
              <p>My guess is that its because either the facilities are under-utilised (need more buses to cover per-bus-cost), or the facilities are in fact, over-utilised.</p>
              <p>I only know the figure says that SMRT's costs are higher. It suggests sub-optimal allocation of resources.</p>

              cbb... it's not so easy over routing issue...
              
              LTA now does the routing.. and also, some bus rts to split them can be tricky... like 178... it has to use the new road network to pick up the displaced pax...

              <p>I dont know where the higher costs come from also.</p>
              <p>My guess is that its because either the facilities are
              under-utilised (need more buses to cover per-bus-cost), or the
              facilities are in fact, over-utilised.</p>
              <p>I only know the figure says that SMRT's costs are higher. It
              suggests sub-optimal allocation of resources.</p>

              <p>a few factors i have come up with</p>
              <p>1. too much dead mileage, due to fact that the routes are mostly long haul and where their depot is located.</p>
              <p>2. most of their routes have peakish demand. Direction 1 super packed in AM Peak, but Direction 2 is very very very low. look at those that ply expressways.</p>
              <p>3. depreciation cost higher for buses that are completely build up, and possibly a shorter depreciation period.</p>
              <p>4. most of their catchment in their estates end up taking the MRT, partly due to the routes they ply and the hub and spoke system they have in its estates.</p>
              <p>having high demand or high ridership doesnt mean high revenue. analysing their OD is key.</p>

              <p>Too limited like choice of selection for new depots. Should spread out more, don't be like Woodlands area one, double depot~ Unless they arrange the service well(eg. New one take Woodlands/CCK/BPJ side, Old one tkae Woodlands/Yishun/AMK side).</p>

              <p><br>So SMRT should NOT even be participating the tender in the first place, if it is serious in mind of improving public transport first. But no, they don't put that in mind. They are more concerned about profits than what they are supposed to provide.</p>
              <p>Don't use LTA as an excuse to hide that mistake. If they are serious about their bus services, they should have withdraw their buses to improve their current bus services by their own initiatives and use only their BusPlus buses for RWS till the current contract expires.</p>
