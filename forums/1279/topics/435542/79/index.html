              Might be awesome if Singapore's public buses have this kind of glass windows fitted on the roof - allowing sunlight to penetrate the passenger cabin and also for the passengers to see what's above~

              <p>Don't be a kid. You are a clone and use another account and hide your identity. That's even stupid. You are a clone and spammer. Don't go telling mistakes and hide away. Don't think since you're behind the computer people can't find you. There's something called IP address. The ISP can trace you for that and give the punishments accordingly for spamming and cloning.</p>
