              Back in the days when SBS was undergoing the fleet repainting to SBS Transit, the Leyland Olympian 3 axle (LO3X) fleet had their full red rims painted to sliver before the actual SBS Transit livery was applied - and all of a sudden it was hard to distinguish from far between its Volvo Olympian 3 axles (batch 1) (VO3X) cousins which had sliver rims (but with red hub) all along which was also being repainted to sliver rims &amp; hubs. 
              <p>
              The LO3X and VO3X (Batch 1) fleet were still running around in SuperBus livery with sliver rims as each one of them awaits repainting - to the untrained eye, LO3X might be mistaken as VO3X batch 1. Eventually got used and learnt how to differentiate from the grilles, axle hub and upper deck window - roof space later on.
              </p><p>
              Needless to say, the SBS Transit livery and sliver rims is bold and modern looking, it seemed like it was from a science fiction movie in 2003.

              <p>Sv 3 &amp; Sv 518 will be swapping their boarding berths at PSR Int WEF 06 Apr 13. Posters pasted at PSR Int as of today.</p>
              <p>Sv 3 will move from its current boarding berth B7 at the end of the int (which Sv 3 shares with Sv 88 &amp; 359) to berth B3, taking the place of Sv 518. Sv 3's new berth will be shared with Sv 12, 5 &amp; 403. </p>
              <p>Not a surprise given how practically day-in-day-out almost no one boards Sv 518 from the Int. Sv 3 is the opposite story. 2nd time Sv 3 has switched its berth at PSR Int though. </p>

              <p>We are not stupid. There is an obvious pattern for the clone accounts. One new created, the previous account decommissioned. Either that or the previous account got banned like ghost79. One can wonder how many email accounts you have used up for this bullshit.</p>
