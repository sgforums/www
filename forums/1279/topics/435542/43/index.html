              <p>The popularity of Dennis Lance 245 has fallen drastically.</p>

              <p>980 is the service with the second largest number of Lances of only 5, some of the former 980 Lances are laid up but not replaced by other Lances anymore, but instead replace by 2 OC500LEs (the other OC is used to replace TIB661A even though I dunno why).</p>
              <p>So far TIB908P (Former AMDEP 167) and TIB928G (Former AMDEP SP/961) has been deregistered early due to unknown reasons.</p>

                              <p>The popularity of Dennis Lance 245 has fallen drastically.</p>
              <p>3 months ago, many services such as 167, 852, 855 and 985 no
              longer has permanent Dennis Lances operating (Even if they were to
              operate on these service, they are usually SP)</p>
              <p>A lot of them are now AMDEP SP (All the Lances are at
              AMDEP).</p>
              <p>Dominating these Lances now is Service 853, which so far
              continues to occupy more than 3/4 of the current 853 fleet, and
              haven't really been changed since (other than the deregistered
              Nissan diesel being replaced by 1 OC500LE)</p>
              <p>980 is the service with the second largest number of Lances of
              only 5, some of the former 980 Lances are laid up but not replaced
              by other Lances anymore, but instead replace by 2 OC500LEs (the
              other OC is used to replace TIB661A even though I dunno why).</p>
              <p>So far TIB908P (Former AMDEP 167) and TIB928G (Former AMDEP
              SP/961) has been deregistered early due to unknown reasons.</p>
              <p>What is your view about these lances, which is believed to be
              deregistered in the late 2015 (though rumoured to be earlier)?</p>
              <p>Did you know? TIB919H has a slightly different rear window! It
              is green when viewed from outside, unlike the original black which
              is observed for the other lances.</p>

              I like taking UMW Dennis Lance buses because I like its acceleration, its speed and its engine sound which is full of energy! I'd miss this model.
