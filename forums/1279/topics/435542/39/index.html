              <p><br> You are correct, I was never part of this dicussion until
              today. I remember seeing this facebook page called Public
              Transport Hub which posted a Wright B9TL on 174e, much earlier than
              BIS. And this page called Singapore Buses posting everyday of
              what i believe some people terms as "cameos" daily. Some other
              smaller pages also posts similar contents. If BIS is guilty of your
              nonsense, i am very sure all the other pages are.</p>

              <p>He isn't a moderator dipstick. Look at the mod list before ranting on him, since you're so good at criticising others why don't you do it? And yes, a thread has been posted about this, which had seemingly disappeared, and the Queen has been contacted, so only time can tell for sure. Meanwhile, I would appreciate that, since a thousand others have already ranted about this clone, <strong>you zip your mouth and not add to the amount of complaints we are seeing. Thanks</strong></p>

              <p>I agree that Voith gives far less trouble than ZF.</p>
              <p>By midlife, usually that's when the ZF starts to give all the problems.</p>
              <p>At best, you hear a nauseating CRAAACK as the the lock-up clutch engages.</p>
              <p>At worst, the clutch doesn't even work.</p>
              <p>And you hear all kinds of funny sounds as the gearbox ages further.</p>
              <p>Voith doesn't give as much problems, but as the gearbox ages, the lock-up clutch does seem to take more time to engage and you can hear that from the MKIII in between the 1st and 2nd.</p>
              <p>I have taken a VSO that was stuck in 2nd gear once. And that was on 161, so you can imagine how it felt like on TPE.</p>
