              Your false claim made previously, you entirely forgot?
              FYI the company you alleged in that claim is investigating your false claim. It questions your authentity of whatever you posted.

              <p>you see, all he wanted was to gain popularity of new incoming bus enthusiasts in singapore, that doesnt know what is going on (ie. dan474 etc) . they are successfully fallen for buses[in]gapore due to his oh-so-loyal activity he gave to them. its not that difficult anyway.. it all started when mark leaked information about a particular item that is highly confidential to a large group of (matured) enthusiasts. it is clearly stated that the information must not be spread to other people except within the enthusiasts themselves. of course, people will feel very displeased towards the attitude of his when he leaked the information. the problem was that mark did not dare to own up his silly mistake. a clear, short/long apology could very much satisfy those angered enthusiasts, but no; he started bragging about all other issues not relating/some related to that particular confidential material. he was then banned (natural reaction). in order for him to probably gain back his popularity, he started to set up buses[in]gapore (former TIB1083L/TIB537B) in popular sharing sites such as fb/blog/sgf/msn . the main question is : <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why pinpoint others when you yourself create your own silly mistake without any explanation or apology?</span>  do you feel enraged if you happen to come across this type of person? furthermore his loyal followers that were unknowingly fell into, was told "exclusive" information about a person, causing the new members to feel "xenophobic" and try their best to avoid the targeted person. no shame at all. i have never ever came across this type of singaporean before in my life, as a singaporean myself. selfish, rude, tries to be always positive in that "layer of mask" he is hiding till today.</p>
