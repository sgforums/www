              <p>To all fans of SMRT's Mercedes-Benz O405s,</p>
              <p>Refurbishment of O405s CACs is going on which is good news of course. However, what is happening is that they are undergoing some crazy that you may now have difficulty comparing which O405 is OAC and which is CAC.</p>
              <p>It seems like the CACs are going to have the same fate as TIB792E. The most noticeable change, of course, is the transformation of sliding windows to non-sliding windows found in OAC buses. The only way to differentiate them is probably the air-con ducts now.</p>
              <p>Here is a photo of the refurbished TIB725A, taken from (buses[IN]gapore!)<img style="vertical-align: bottom;" src="http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/534716_432020350171778_638732219_n.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Emergency exit door window changed to tinted one, old one no longer retained (TIB725A)</li>
              <li>Front and rear windscreen, and driver's window also changed.</li>
              <li>The rims are also painted black.</li>

              <p>lol found some old press release on SBS website..<br><br>
              </p><p>13 May 1998</p>
              <p>CONVERSION TO PARTIAL AND FULLY AIRCON SERVICES</p>
              <p>SBS is reviewing its deployment of aircon buses to better meet demand patterns and customers’ preferences for aircon services. To maximise the use of aircon buses to benefit the majority of the commuting public, priority will be given to redeploy aircon buses to serve the Central Business District, Changi Airport and high demand areas. This means that some fully aircon services in non-CBD and low demand areas will have to be converted to partial aircon services.</p>
              <p>Starting from Monday, 18 May 1998, Services 27 and 195 will be converted to fully aircon services while Services 35, 37, 91 and 191 will be converted to partial aircon services. </p>
              <p>SBS is now working towards the minimum 80% aircon bus fleet by year 2000, the deadline set by PTC for meeting the new minimum requirement for deployment of aircon buses. This new guideline was in response to the public’s growing preference for more aircon buses. In the long run, with the injection of more aircon buses, all services will be fully aircon.</p>
              <p>Service 27 plies between Tampines Interchange and Changi Airport PTB 1 and 2.<br>Service 195 plies between Marina Centre Terminal and Commonwealth Avenue(loop).<br>Service 35 plies between Bedok Interchange and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal(loop).<br>Service 37 plies between Tampines Interchange and Changi North Crescent(loop).<br>Service 91 plies between Buona Vista Terminal and Ayer Rajah Crescent(loop)<br>Service 191 plies between Buona Vista Terminal and Portsdown Road(loop). </p>

              </p><p>Another one...<br><br>PRESS RELEASE</p>
              <p>For immediate release</p>
              <p><strong>25 Jul 99</strong></p>
              <p><strong>SBS TAKES OVER BUS OPERATIONS IN SENGKANG</strong></p>
              <p>From today, SBS takes over from Tibs the operation of Services 864, 865 and 866 in Sengkang. The takeover of Sengkang services will enable SBS to provide an integrated and seamless bus and rail service along the northeast corridor. SBS will be a multi-modal public transport operator when the NorthEast MRT and Sengkang LRT start operation in 2002, followed by Punggol LRT 2 years later.</p>
              <p>This will involve SBS taking over the bus services in Sengkang and Punggol in exchange for our services in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok. Under Phase 1 implemented today, SBS gives up Service 190 in Choa Chu Kang.</p>
              <p>MPs for Cheng San GRC, Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Punggol Central) and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Punggol East) joined residents and grassroots representatives in Sengkang town this morning in a ceremony to mark the takeover of Sengkang bus services by SBS.</p>
              <p>In his speech, Dr Michael Lim said that Sengkang residents can look forward to a yet higher level of public transport service as the integration would cover routes, fares, information and facilities. He added, There will be better integration of timings, schedules and routes to further enhance the service level of residents in the NorthEast corridor.</p>
              <p>To mark the takeover of Sengkang services, residents are given a complimentary ride on any of the 3 services today. The first 500 residents who turned up at the ceremony also received a farecard from SBS.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Immediate service improvements by SBS in Sengkang..</span></p>
              <p>More than 30 double deck Superbuses are deployed on Services 864, 865 and 88 to immediately increase the capacity and provide a higher level of comfort for Sengkang residents.</p>
              <p>Starting today, Sengkang residents get a new service. The extension of Service 27 to Sengkang provides residents with new links to Tampines and Changi Airport. Previously, Service 27 plied between Tampines and Changi Airport.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Improved service information..</span></p>
              <p>Commuters of Services 864, 865 and 866 can now pick up a copy of service guide on board the buses. These guides tell commuters all they need to know about the service. It contains information on fares, route details, operating hours, frequency and major landmarks along the route. Service guides are already available on all regular SBS trunk services and at interchanges.</p>
              <p>Service information boards will be strategically placed at 4 locations around Sengkang. Besides displaying route and fare information, we have included an additional feature, a Sengkang Town map, to facilitate travel in Sengkang. Major landmarks like schools, playhouse, community centre and place of worship are clearly shown on the map.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SBS President, Mr Phua Tin How on future bus plans.</span></p>
              <p>Said SBS President, Mr Phua Tin How, SBS will increase the number of services and network coverage in Sengkang in tandem with the growth of the town. We have added one more service today and have plans to introduce three more services by the end of this year, and another four services by end 2000. These services will provide new links to the other housing estates and major centres of activities.</p>
              <p>Service 864 plies between Sengkang and Marina Centre via Upper Serangoon Road.<br>Service 865 plies between Sengkang and World Trade Centre via Orchard Road.<br>Service 866 plies between Sengkang and Ang Mo Kio via Jalan Kayu.</p>

              <p>It's because we Asians got stereotype thinking.In SG generally ppl say Toyota the best hence the higher resale price.They got this thinking passing to next gen even though Toyota ain't invisible nowadays.For trucks n buses ppl think MB,Volvos Scanias are the best.<strong>Imagine with sub standard smrt maintenance the DAF engine still going strong </strong></p>
