              <p>So what if you got into a conflict with him? I'm allowing you to explain your side of the story. When I'm hard on you, you say i'm treating you as an ememy. I'm giving you a chance here. I want to hear from your side also. I don't want to be biased to anyone here. So, it takes both hands to clap. </p>

                      Simply put, buses[in]gapore! /mark chua was banned by SPTinfo.net due to him leaking of restricted info of a SMRT demo not supposed to be known to the public. He was not happy about it, and hence went all the way out to "make everything even" with the aim of SPTinfo.net's utter destruction, at any cost.
                      
                      <p>
                      buses[in]gapore! is now the trendsetter, so we are merely following what he preaches. A harsher stance is the new reality and world order that everyone must accept now, which his young followers like dan474 and gang have difficulty adapting to.

              <p>The restricted info of the SMRT demo came from SPTinfo.net's thread, no less. With the picture in the thread behind permission levels. SPTinfo.net hosted that demo info without permission and the threadstarter was told to remove the photo.
              :)</p> <br>
              
              <p>Why was SPTinfo.net hosting those so much restricted info without permission from 
               company? To catch buses "conveniently" with everything at their fingertips, going as far as to obtain insider info/resources and calling it "exclusive/first hand reliable" info. Remember the letter from TIB1232Z/ oh teng swee? The very tone of the email to kuang
