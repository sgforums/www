            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Zilchster:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, I don't trust LTA planning all the bus routes.  Do they actually know what the passengers want or not?<br><br>Firstly, what would they do with existing bus routes?  Will they be radically be rationalised?  Will direct links between places be further axed?  Do we have to make more transfers from bus to bus, bus to train etc?  Especially with the recent MRT fiasco and the many times train trips have been interrupted?  How exactly reliable can the hub and spoke system be?  We ain't doing a Singapore Airlines at Changi Airport.<br><br>I am happy that the same fares will be charged by distance though.  If this doesn't translate into higher fares.<br><br>And I think the tender is crap.  Bus operators will definitely wanna cherry pick more profitable and viable routes and shun unprofitable ones away.  Unless the routes come in a package.  The bus operator has to operate a mixture of routes that have high and low passenger loads.<br><br>And a third, fourth bus company?  I hope that will materialise?  But I doubt it will happen.  New companies need a substantial fleet of buses to enter the market.  Existing companies might need to re-fit their current buses to meet the current standards?  Which company will wanna invest in a business that does not bring high business yields?  There's no First or Business class in bus services.  And you need a fleet of a few hundred of buses and it has to be Euro 4 and WAB.  All these needs $$$.<br><br>Competition between buses?  Unless buses ply the exact same route, otherwise there is no direct competition.  Crap.<br><br>Actually the best solution is this.<br><br>1) Merge all the transport companies under one roof or the second one is preferred...<br><br>2) Management shakeup at the SMRT and keep the existing status of both companies status quo but integrate the frequencies a bit here and there...but given the irregular frequency of SMRT ... i don't know it this would work.<br></div></blockquote>Agree. I feel that having too many bus companies for "competition" is not suitable for Singapore. Look how small Singapore is. They like to compare with HK, which is don't know how many times larger than us. I also feel that they should go under 1 company. Bus for bus, train for train. Under the same company, depots can come together. You get the cue from here.<br><br>I also agree with you that with future plans already expanding for both transport operators, what happens to extra buses? It really sucks to say this, but I don't want a duopoly or triopoly etc etc etc... monopoly is the best IMO.<br><br>In general, bus routes are axed to avoid duplication of the MRT lines. Coming up we'd see more withdrawal or axing of services. However I feel that that should not do that simply because it acts as a backup in case of any emergency. But then, fuel costs come into place. So I'd say both are not any good solutions either.<br><br>I'm also one of the many who disagree with Ms Saw's arrogant attitude for SMRT. Look at the state of SMRT today because of her. Tibs, originally a good-profiled company, became lousy under her. However I'm not totally anti-SMRT, like what some here are "practicing". I believe the fault lies in Ms Saw and not the rest of the company. I've seen cases whereby people pull in anything related to SMRT and starts crapping bullsheet around. That isn't nice, I must say.<br><br>Zilchster, if you were Mr. Raymond Lim, what would you do? I'd like to hear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

              <p>this is a good idea, especially for trains. saves the need to do repainting all the time when operators switch , which will only become more common  with shorter operating contracts.</p>
              <p>this is how the London Underground and NYC Subway works as well. you dont really know who is the operator unless you inspect the minute details.</p>

              <p><br>NYC Subways is fully operated by their government's Metropolitian Transit Authority, no separate operators. Proof is that trains from all over the system would visit the main maintenance yard a few times in their lifespan.</p>

              <b>Increasing Frequencies of Basic Bus Services, including Feeder Services</b><br>
              <br>
                      16.             To shorten bus journey and waiting times, and reduce crowding, we will enhance the frequency of basic bus services.  In particular, we will put priority on corridors affected by impending ERP expansion, where the bus operators will increase the peak period frequency of all basic bus services from 15 minutes to 12 minutes by June 2008 and 10 minutes by August 2009.<br> <br>
                       
                      17.             Many commuters use feeder bus services to connect to MRT stations and bus interchanges.  To reduce their waiting time, we will increase the frequency of feeder services.  Over and above the minimum frequencies which the Public Transport Council (PTC) specifies for all bus services, the PTC will also be spelling out a separate and higher Quality of Service (QoS) standard for peak hour feeder bus services. The PTC will announce changes after consultation with the public transport operators.<br><br>
                       
                      18.             The bus operators will have to procure additional buses to run the trunk and feeder bus services at higher frequencies.  As this will take time, LTA will in the interim, extend the statutory life span of existing buses to expedite implementation. <br><br>
                       
                  <b>Allowing Basic Bus Services to Duplicate Parts of the Rail Network</b><br><br>
                       
                      19.             Today, trunk buses are not allowed to run routes that are parallel to rail lines. This avoids wasteful duplication of resources, which would increase the overall cost of our public transport system.  However, LTA has reviewed and will relax this rule for  the mature rail lines, namely the North-South and East-West lines, where ridership is high and the scope for expanding rail capacity quickly is limited.  From June 2008, we will allow new bus services to ply along the North-South and East West lines where there is persistent heavy passenger loading during peak hours.  For example, it will now be possible to have a more direct bus that runs parallel to the North-South Line, from Ang Mo Kio to Orchard Road, compared to existing services which have more indirect routes. This would give commuters an attractive alternative to trains.<br><br>
                       
                  <b>Expanding Premium Bus Services to Provide More Choices</b><br><br>
                       
                      20.             We will also expand premium bus services which provide more comfortable and direct journeys.  We currently have 42 services. We will work with the bus operators to increase the number to at least 72 by June 2008, putting priority on routes affected by ERP expansion. For example, premium bus services will provide direct connections from residential areas such as Katong, Holland, Bukit Timah, Choa Chu Kang, Sengkang, Tampines, and Yio Chu Kang to the Shenton Way, Robinson Road, Suntec City and Orchard Road areas.  The operators will also provide return trips in the evening on high demand services.
