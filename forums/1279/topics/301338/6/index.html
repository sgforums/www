The bus company will still have same operational costs (even higher due to fleet renew/ oil prices) and where will this cost saving go to? it must end up somewhere to cover the operational costs or else the bus co. will make losses.<br>My worry is they might end up bringing up the fares for shorter rides to cover this cost saving. Also, will it also end up in another fare hike to cover this cost saving?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Just 2cents of my thoughts... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

BC has to tap the card on the Timekeeper office first regardless on whether he is early or late. For Service 812 buses, sometimes it's just a 10-second wait, sometimes it's a 5-minute wait, because there is only 1 bus on BREAK at any time at Yishun INT.<br><br>However, for 811, when the BC drives in the bus after first round of southern loop, he HAS to wait because the sequence of buses is such that only after he reaches the INT the 2nd bus doing eastern loop will move.<br><br>Let's assume Bus A is on BREAK, while Bus B is doing first round of south loop.<br><br>Only when Bus B reaches the terminal will Bus A move. This is due to their fleet size as well as journey time. Hence Bus B has to wait at the interchange for a sizeable time (8 minutes or more) before Bus B can depart the interchange again for 2nd round of eastern loop. Hence it is actually quite normal to have to wait in the interchange on board 811 for more than 10 minutes (usually). Often when I take 811 to go to Chong Pang for my haircut I experience the same situation.<br><br>The reason why 812 does not have such long waits is because due to the fleet size and it's journey time. Assuming we have Bus A and Bus B again, with Bus B now doing the first round of eastern loop.<br><br>Bus A moves off on Central loop FIRST before Bus B arrives. Hence when Bus B arrives the BC just needs to tap his card and he can move off already. Thus at any time in the interchange there will only be 1 812 bus on BREAK, and when other 812 buses arrive in the interchange USUALLY both the Central and East loop buses arrive.<br><br>So, before these buses arrive there's only 1 812 bus.<br><br>After 812 buses arrive the number will increase to 3 (temporarily).<br><br>The bus doing central loop will move on immediately to do east loop, while the east loop bus we will have to see. If it's only completed first round then the BC taps card at TK office then he is allowed to move off. If he has completed 2 rounds then he drives his bus to park while the bus that has been parking at 812 bendy lots will the proceed to do Central loop. So after both Central and East loop buses leave, the number reduces to 1 again.<br><br>811 is a special case. At any time in the interchange there will be TWO buses; 1 on BREAK (after doing 2 rounds) and another also on BREAK (but after doing 1 round). So the BC that is doing short BREAK after first round has to wait for the next bus to come into INT before he can move.<br><br>804 practically has no breaks for BC. Arrive into BC straightaway continue another round. I think they may have JUMP BUS for it but I'm still unsure of it. Could be BC does a few times before he is allowed to JUMP BUS.</div></blockquote>The logic is a bit not there. Ok maybe i'm too used to how SBST Townlinks operate for the Tampines and Pasir Ris ones. How about you copy either/or an 811/812 weekday timesheet then we analyse from there? Best if you are able to get 2 of each service.<br><br>804 do have breaks and they dont jump bus. They simply do 2-4 trips of 804 before having a break.<br><br>you still have lots to learn my friend.</div>

Turn right out of INT then going past the industrial estate, crosses AVE 2 and heads to Chong Pang. After which, it turns left opposite Yishun MRT Station (instead of right) into AVE 2 and turns right, past the industrial estate, by which turning out after the CC and finally reaches the terminal.<br><br>Waste of time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div></blockquote>It's amazing that you proclaim and market yourself as a Yishun bus fan and did not notice the special bus stop almost directly opposite Yishun MRT which is only served by 811. This bus stop effectively divides the circuitous route into 2 parts, where peeps living in Ave 7/Sembawang Rd just take the bus to this bus stop, alight and cross the road to transfer to the MRT. From Ave 7 it takes no more than 10mins.<br><br>For residents living along Sembawang Rd/Yishun Ave 7, there's always the option of the much shorter 800 or 965 back home.<br><br>If you have bothered to take 811 before, you would have noticed that the bus loads is lowest between the abovementioned bus stop and Ave 7, where it starts picking up workers working in the industrial park and residents back to Yishun Int, where it is at most a 10-15mins ride away for that section.<br><br>Thus effectively the portion of the route is divided into 3 sections serving 2 rather seperate groups -<br><br>Yishun Int-&gt;Yishun Ave 7 (ITE, workers, residents in N3,N2)<br>Yishun Ave 7-&gt;Yishun Ave 5 (opp Yishun MRT) (residents in N7, N1)<br>Yishun Ave 7-&gt;YIshun Int (ITE, workers, residents in N3,N2)<br><br>The connection between these 2 groups serves a small passenger base who will find it a direct convenient link (eg housewives going to Chong Pang market, students studying at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary)</div>

Svc 804 SLs rests for an equivalent of 1-2 trips after every trip, which translate to about 8mins during non peak and 5-7mins during peak hour. Yes, they rest even during peak hours unless they are very late that they appear to do another trip out immediately (not that common).<br><br>I also don't think 804 jumps bus at all; its inherited from TIBS days that SLs are assigned to their own bus which is carried on until now.</div>

This was a regular afternoon arrangement that started in '99 (bendies after '00) to help with the afternoon school crowd.<br><br>Seeing the bendies or even producing a photograph of a svc 804 bendy further down the route or disembarking passengers at Yishun Ave 2/Yishun MRT does not imply that the bus actually did the full route with the 3 point turn!<br><br>The only time when bendy appeared on 804 and did full route was in '99 when they did try with a box bendy and appeared that the bus had much difficulty doing the U-turn and the idea was subsequently dropped to have bendies run full route on 804. It was only after the Yishun St 41 amendment that bendies became permanent on 804.</div>

How can it be fair when a passenger utilizes the public transport system without paying a cent? Instead, he will be either charged the minimum fare, or the system will be smart enough to distinguish that he is traveling to and fro once between his home and the place to buy stuff and in this case, 2 times the minimum fare.<br><br>I believe LTA is modeling the system to work such that a passenger do not get penalized for making multiple transfers between his origin and destination (and between bus / MRT), and this is the only target audience which will really see the benefit in this system. aka distance based fares.</div>
