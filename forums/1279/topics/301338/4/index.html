Turn right out of INT then going past the industrial estate, crosses AVE 2 and heads to Chong Pang. After which, it turns left opposite Yishun MRT Station (instead of right) into AVE 2 and turns right, past the industrial estate, by which turning out after the CC and finally reaches the terminal.<br><br>Waste of time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>811E still ok.<br><br>Actually right, if you want to take feeder/intratown into some parts of Yishun very easy. Yishun is labelled into 3 sections, Central, East and South.<br><br>800 - East crossover to Central (N2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> N7)<br>804 - East (N2 &amp; N3)<br>806 - Central (N4)<br>811 - East (N1, N2, N3 and industrial estate)<br>811E - South (N8 &amp; some parts of N6)<br>812 - Central (N6)<br>812E - East (N1 &amp; N7)<br><br>With this in mind, you won't take the wrong service.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Actually this reminds me of Express 520 which started from Yishun last time. Instead of following other trunk services that are heading towards City by using AVE 2 and Lentor AVE, Express 520 loops around Chong Pang and then turns right at Khatib MRT Station, which was, quite redundant because it was a waste of time.<br><br>Speaking of 800, it's also quite a loopabout service. Turning into Yishun CC outside INT it goes around N2 and then crosses AVE 2 into Chong Pang area and goes around N7. But then it passes by Chong Pang area again and back into N2, before turning out of the CC into the interchange. That's why many people living around the Chong Pang area chose to take 812 to the interchange because it was very direct. Yishun Ring Road  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> AVE 2, excluding waiting time it only takes 5 minutes to get to the interchange. Whereas for 800, it takes around 15 - 17 minutes. I've seen many times 800 came first then followed by 812, 812 reached the terminal first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So, if you are going to the main areas of Yishun, here's my advice:<br><br>South: 811 (Only takes 5 minutes to get to opp. NTUC Block 849)<br>East: 812 (7 mintues to get to opp. Chong Pang CC and 10 minutes to N7 area compared with 20 - 25 minutes to N7 for 800.)<br>Central: 812 for N6 area after SAFRA, 806 for those in N4 and a bit of N3 area.<br></div>

Most feeders/intratowns in Singapore uses this P-loop style whereby they loop after a certain section and eventually end up on the opposite side after doing the loop, forming this P-loop shape route. So it's best to take the bus back to where you came from.</div>

LTA read this!</div></blockquote>The loop is quite big yeah...<br><br>Of all the feeder/intratown services in Yishun, only 804 and 812 are good services. Passenger demand is high and the route is short and simple. But they could use some more buses, especially 804. 6 buses is a bit too little for it's demand.<br><br>800 is quite a redundant service. It goes to N2 (which already has 804 serving it) and takes a long time to go to N7 (which is it's looping point) while 812E goes to N7 in less than 10 mins. Hope LTA can do something to change it's loop to make it short and simple for N7 residents.</div>
