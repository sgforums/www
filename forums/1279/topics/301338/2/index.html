            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jan 18, 2008<br><span style="color: darkblue;">Public bus market to be liberalised</span><br>Govt takes bold initiative to increase competition so as to provide more efficient bus services<br>By Christopher Tan, The Straits Times (Online)</strong><br><br>BUS commuters have long been second-class road users. Not anymore. Transport Minister Raymond Lim on Friday unveiled a slew of initiatives that will make commuting by bus much faster and more comfortable than it is today.<br><br>First off, the Land Transport Authority will assume the role as centralised bus route planner, so that commuters in all areas of Singapore are better served and waiting times are cut.<br><br>'Currently, the two public transport operators plan the bus routes within their areas of operation based on commercial considerations, subject to minimum service obligations,'' the minister said. He said this has led to some services running at intervals of more than half an hour.<br><br>After LTA has taken over as central bus route planner by end-2009, it will open up the bus market to more players. Today, the market is dominated by SBS Transit, with SMRT Buses as much smaller second player. <strong><span style="color: red;">The LTA will invite tenders from any company keen to ply specific 'route parcels' to be drawn up.<br><br>Secondly, fares will be purely distance-based, and the current transfer penalty will be removed.</span></strong> So if a commuter decides to change bus (or go from a bus to a train) so as to get to his destination faster, he will pay the same fare as someone who does not break up his journey.<br><br>This is because the new bus services structure ahead will be a 'hub-and-spoke' system (as opposed to the current system of many direct services), and might require more transfers. 'Transfers are part and parcel of a hub-and-spoke system,' Mr Lim said.<br><br>Then, the Government will roll out measures to ensure that buses get right of way on the road. There will be more bus lanes, with the <strong><span style="color: red;">length of full-day bus lanes trebling from 7km today to 23km by June.</span></strong><br><br>It will be mandatory for motorists to give way to buses exiting bus baysÂ†; and buses will have priority signal lights at major junctions. With these moves, it hopes to raise the average speed of buses to 20-25kmh by next year - from 19kmh today.<br><br>The Government will also build more integrated transport hubs - where bus and rail services meet. There are currently three (Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Sengkang), with two more (Boon Lay and Clementi) coming up in the next couple of years. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Five more will be built over the next decade.</strong></span><br><br>Finally, integrated transport information, which will help commuters plan their journeys as well as let them know when their buses are arriving.<br><br>'By 2015, our target is for 80 per cent of public transport commuters to complete their journeys within an hour, from the point they set off, to arriving at their destination - up from 71 per cent today,' the minister said.<br><br>He added that by 2020, travelling by public transport should not take more than 1.5 times than a journey by car - down from the current 1.7 times. - SPH<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Key changes to improve land transport in S'pore</span></strong><br>Â• Distance-based fares to allow transfers<br>Commuter will no longer be penalised when they transfer from one bus to another while still on the same journey. The fare will be calculated based on the total distance travelled instead and the commuters will pay less for the distance. For example, a trip from Sin Ming in Thomson to the Singapore Management University at Bras Basah will cost $1.09 instead of $1.31 now.<br><br>Â• Buses will get more priority on the road<br>There will be more full-day bus lanes so that buses can have unimpeded travel. It will be mandatory for all other vehicles to give way to buses exiting from bus bays by end of 2008. By June 2008, network of normal bus lanes will be extended from 120 km to 150 km, and full-day bus lanes will treble from 7 km to 23 km. Bus drivers now spend 9 per cent of their time on the roads waiting for others to give way. These measures to give priority to buses will increase bus speeds to 20 to 25 kph by 2009, up from the current 16 kph for feeder buses and 19 kph for trunk buses.<br><br>Â• More competition to operate buses<br>LTA will open up the market and tender out parcels of bus routes to anyone who can deliver the services at the standards it spells out. Cities in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong have moved towars making their bus services more contestable. They found that introducing some form of competition, or even just the real threat of competition, is an effective way to keep bus operations efficient and raise service standards. There are now two public transport operators - the SMRT and SBS Transit - in Singapore running about 3,700 buses on the roads. This has lead to a situation where out of more than 250 bus services, only 35 per cent are run at intervals of 10 minutes or less. Some even run at intervals longer than 30 minutes. The feeder buses make huge, circuitous loops before they get to the MRT station or bus interchange. There is no integrated travel information from the two operators.<br><br>Â• Centralised bus planning<br>The public transport system serves two-thirds of all commuter trips in Singapore, thus, rail and buses must work in close partnership. By 2009, LTA will take on central planning of the bus network so that there will be only one agency handling the land transport planning, which will integrate the bus, rail and the road network.<br><br>Â• Speeding up travel by public transport<br>By 2015, the target is for 80 per cent of public transport commuters to complete their journeys within an hour - up from 71 per cent today. Gap between public transport and car journey times will be narrowed. By 2020, journeys on public transport should not take more than 1.5 times that by car, a drop from the current 1.7 times. At least 80 per cent of bus services must be run at peak frequencies of 10 minutes or less by August 2009, compared with 15 minutest today.<br><br>Â• More niche services<br>Expect more niche bus services like the premium buses from housing estates to the city centre. <strong><span style="color: red;">Over 60 are running and another 40 more are awaiting approval.</span></strong><br><br>Â• Integrated public transport service information<br>Travel information is a missing link in the commuting chain until recently. To reduce the anxiety of waiting and provide more certainty on journey times, dynamic, real-time information will be made available to commuters on the go. To help people plan their journeys better, LTA and Transitlink will come up with an enhanced integrated public transport journey planner, which also has basic map features by July 2008. There will also be an interactive electronic map of the island where commuters can get information on bus service routes, bus stops and rail stations, arrival information and landmarks at a glance - at home or on office computer, and mobile devices.<br><br>Â† finally following australia's lead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>36. As LTA works with the operators to refine the fare system, it will also work towards <strong><span style="color: red;">making available an integrated season pass for travel on both bus and rail regardless of operator.</span></strong><br><br>44. We will therefore embark on a programme to build more integrated public transport hubs as well as upgrade existing bus interchanges. We have already started building two more integrated bus interchanges at Boon Lay (2009) and Clementi (2011) which will be ready in a few years, bringing the total number of integrated bus interchanges to 5 (Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Sengkang).  Over the next 10 years, <strong><span style="color: red;">we will upgrade another 5 interchanges at Bedok, Jurong East, Serangoon, Joo Koon and Marina South</span></strong> in tandem with the re-development in these areas, to better integrate our transport hubs with the surrounding facilities.<br><br>47. Going forward, to reduce the anxiety of waiting and provide more certainty on journey times, we will make available dynamic, real-time travel information to commuters on the go.  Last year, LTA piloted real-time bus arrival information panels at 30 bus stops in the CBD and two HDB towns (Yishun and Ang Mo Kio).

Over the years through my observations, the government seem to always mean what they say, and for most cases, initiate  what they plan. Our government is considered to be quite efficient in these areas...we're not like our neighbours across the causeway; so many plans, do halfway, then suddenly stop work.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Hence, our current bus industry of about 3,700 buses could potentially support more than the current two operators," Transport Minister Raymond Lim said in a speech to announce the results of the year-long review.<br><br>Lim said the intention is for operators to compete periodically for the right to provide bus services, adding that these operators "will have to fulfil service obligations or risk being replaced when their term is up".<br><br>The introduction of competition will be implemented after another year or so of studies, Lim said.<br><br>The review will also change the way bus operators plan their service networks, putting the decision into the hands of the government.<br><br>SBS Transit currently operates more than 2,800 public buses while SMRT has 860.<br><br>The government in 2003 liberalised Singapore's taxi industry by issuing new licenses to private operators, ending the duopoly also held then by government-linked ComfortDelGro and SMRT.<br><br>But ComfortDelGro continues to dominate the industry with about 16,000 of the 23,000 taxis plying the city-state, while SMRT has 3,000 and four other private operators split the remainder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alrite another one of my reviews<br><br>juz watched the news on this issue<br><br>1) LTA to plan bus routes<br>Boo...<br><br>super bad idea. the bus operators will have all the market research survey data and travel pattern data for planning fo bus routes with them and very well established data this is. this means the local bus operators do start satisofactory new routes based on their current data collected.<br><br>there is no need for a refresh of the process and for LTA to take over the work which has been done excellently by sbs. however it woould be best if LTA had smrtbuses under its control.<br><br>2) buses 10 mins per bus<br>yay<br><br>But not enough. given the projected 5.5 million population figure, the freq has to be much better than 7 mins per bus. 7 mins per bus will bring us on par with korea or Hong Kong. however do note that in UK bus freq are on par with Singapore. its a matter of demand. iif they want 70 percent people taking bus then it has to be 7 mins.<br><br>3) bus lanes<br>boo...<br>more bus lanes.  but is it enough? u have to consider the bus start n stopped by traffic light junction. true more B prority lights but point is bus already get stopped by the light.<br><br>in this case I propose converting all T junctions with a full bus lane (first lane) ACROSS the entire junction without a traffic light applying to bus will work better. howwever a traffic lane divider has to built across all junction so cars and vehicles dun stray into the bus lane whilst turning.<br><br>all day bus lanes wun solve the problem unless bus lanes are segregated from mainstream traffic like korea. people simply do not give way to bues here. esp taxis.<br><br>the idea of contra flow traffic bus lanes was not raised. pity<br><br>4) more bus hubs<br>boo...<br>yes more air-con, more food court, more malls. but do we need this?do we have to tear down bedok int? do we want our memeories of old bedok int to be gone with the wind? me? i treasure history so demolishing our history is not the way.<br><br>5)  more next bus arrival panels<br>yay<br>but they will have to notice that the current panels are faint in light and no one can see it clearly. proof is when u see the news and they show the panels u cant see a thing.<br><br>6) more WAb<br>yay<br><br>but pls no more shaking Gemilang bodied buses. try european made models made CBU in europe instead of relying on local bus builder soon chow to output superior products. however not mind if many bus built by Soon Chow as they the best in the region.<br><br>well i give example: MAN Lion's City in integrated Lion's City bodywork made in germany shipped over to Singapore.<br><br>7) more competition, more bus companies.<br>yay<br>maybe can ask well established players like Stagecoach or KMB to run a franchise bus co in Singapore. or redbus or Arriva.<br><br>8  ) more niche routes<br>boo...<br><br>somehow i dun like these expensive, low demanded routes. no doubt Premium to shenton way has good loads but City Shopper...erm erm<br><br>9) throough fare<br>Yay X10<br><br>raised by many through the years. esp by sv 966. whom raised the idea up first. then suppoerted by me and my ZYXbus. today the issue has finally come true. Singapore will be the first country in the world to boast the fairest bus fare payment system _ THE THROUGH FARE SYSTEM (pay for what u travel, the way u travel and the dist u travel) . i wd like to thank sv966 for writing in the Straits times forum for the raising up of this cool fare system.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>
