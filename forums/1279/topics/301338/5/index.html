BC has to tap the card on the Timekeeper office first regardless on whether he is early or late. For Service 812 buses, sometimes it's just a 10-second wait, sometimes it's a 5-minute wait, because there is only 1 bus on BREAK at any time at Yishun INT.<br><br>However, for 811, when the BC drives in the bus after first round of southern loop, he HAS to wait because the sequence of buses is such that only after he reaches the INT the 2nd bus doing eastern loop will move.<br><br>Let's assume Bus A is on BREAK, while Bus B is doing first round of south loop.<br><br>Only when Bus B reaches the terminal will Bus A move. This is due to their fleet size as well as journey time. Hence Bus B has to wait at the interchange for a sizeable time (8 minutes or more) before Bus B can depart the interchange again for 2nd round of eastern loop. Hence it is actually quite normal to have to wait in the interchange on board 811 for more than 10 minutes (usually). Often when I take 811 to go to Chong Pang for my haircut I experience the same situation.<br><br>The reason why 812 does not have such long waits is because due to the fleet size and it's journey time. Assuming we have Bus A and Bus B again, with Bus B now doing the first round of eastern loop.<br><br>Bus A moves off on Central loop FIRST before Bus B arrives. Hence when Bus B arrives the BC just needs to tap his card and he can move off already. Thus at any time in the interchange there will only be 1 812 bus on BREAK, and when other 812 buses arrive in the interchange USUALLY both the Central and East loop buses arrive.<br><br>So, before these buses arrive there's only 1 812 bus.<br><br>After 812 buses arrive the number will increase to 3 (temporarily).<br><br>The bus doing central loop will move on immediately to do east loop, while the east loop bus we will have to see. If it's only completed first round then the BC taps card at TK office then he is allowed to move off. If he has completed 2 rounds then he drives his bus to park while the bus that has been parking at 812 bendy lots will the proceed to do Central loop. So after both Central and East loop buses leave, the number reduces to 1 again.<br><br>811 is a special case. At any time in the interchange there will be TWO buses; 1 on BREAK (after doing 2 rounds) and another also on BREAK (but after doing 1 round). So the BC that is doing short BREAK after first round has to wait for the next bus to come into INT before he can move.<br><br>804 practically has no breaks for BC. Arrive into BC straightaway continue another round. I think they may have JUMP BUS for it but I'm still unsure of it. Could be BC does a few times before he is allowed to JUMP BUS.</div>

Quite simple if one observes enough.<br><br>As for labelling the routes, I've changed to saying the direction of the town the route goes, like East or South loop. However it's rather rare to find 811E bus on the Eastern loop or 812E bus on the Central loop. I've only encountered 2 such cases in my 8 years of taking 812; once which I forgot and another was a Lance cameo which was going to OS after reaching terminal to be sent back to AMDEP. Most cases are due to very rare unforseen circumstaces unlike WDL feeders that may occur often.</div>

All the OS-Shifts are 911Es, so at the non "E" loop we have TIB525K and some service 963 bus doing the duty, and if you want to alight at WL Checkpoint you would have to transfer to another bus that serves the "E" part. I am not sure how many OS-Shifts on the 911E side but there is 1 which I know using any of the perms. Same case, if you want to alight at Street 81 you have to transfer to a non "E" bus.<br><br>This way, the frequencies of the service will be faster, but then I see TIB525K's OS-Shift far to useless because it keeps on bunching up with 465A which is in front of it, and 525K rarely picks up any pax at all, and it arrives to the interchange too early, about 3 minutes after 465A. Now with the addition of the Service 963 bus it seems worse. TIB465A is picking up almost 0 pax from WRI and only picking up the pax who wants to go to the "E" section of the route, making 525K's shift almost useless. To me, 525K seems useful only if you are late on catching 465A <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
