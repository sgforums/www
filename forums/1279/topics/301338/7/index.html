This is clearly stated in point 51 as it is mentioned regarding limited economy of scales for operators above a fleet size of 500 buses. Merging the current two bus companies will make this worse as it calls for a monopoly instead of competition.<br><br>On the other hand, TransitLink is unlikely to provide the distribution of transport services. It is a company owned by both SMRT and SBST on a 50:50 basis, and to provide integrated service information and fare distribution between the 2 companies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In terms of market basics, i wun support a merger. monopolies tend to be very single minded to profits and dun care bout the consumers . although controlled by LTA, a one bus company with over 95 percent routes in Singapore will simply outbid the little small bus companies for bus routes and everything will be dictaorship-ish<br><br>however having said the above, if LTA has much more power than i think they do, they can churn out a success story with just one bus operator. One has to see the exmaple of Sydney's STA. the first customer contact point is their super cool bus website with all bbus information u need. evven searching Sydney buses tickets will bbring u to hat website for all ur bus travelling needs.<br><br>however can the small island support competition? we have seen in the past that competition led to much chaos.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I don't trust LTA planning all the bus routes.  Do they actually know what the passengers want or not?<br><br>Firstly, what would they do with existing bus routes?  Will they be radically be rationalised?  Will direct links between places be further axed?  Do we have to make more transfers from bus to bus, bus to train etc?  Especially with the recent MRT fiasco and the many times train trips have been interrupted?  How exactly reliable can the hub and spoke system be?  We ain't doing a Singapore Airlines at Changi Airport.<br><br>I am happy that the same fares will be charged by distance though.  If this doesn't translate into higher fares.<br><br>And I think the tender is crap.  Bus operators will definitely wanna cherry pick more profitable and viable routes and shun unprofitable ones away.  Unless the routes come in a package.  The bus operator has to operate a mixture of routes that have high and low passenger loads.<br><br>And a third, fourth bus company?  I hope that will materialise?  But I doubt it will happen.  New companies need a substantial fleet of buses to enter the market.  Existing companies might need to re-fit their current buses to meet the current standards?  Which company will wanna invest in a business that does not bring high business yields?  There's no First or Business class in bus services.  And you need a fleet of a few hundred of buses and it has to be Euro 4 and WAB.  All these needs $$$.<br><br>Competition between buses?  Unless buses ply the exact same route, otherwise there is no direct competition.  Crap.<br><br>Actually the best solution is this.<br><br>1) Merge all the transport companies under one roof or the second one is preferred...<br><br>2) Management shakeup at the SMRT and keep the existing status of both companies status quo but integrate the frequencies a bit here and there...but given the irregular frequency of SMRT ... i don't know it this would work.<br></div>
