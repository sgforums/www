              <p>i feel that the govt's decision to open up the bus business for open-bidding by dividing into 4 zones will create tense competition which would result in employees at the suffering end, companies trying to undercut each other to win bids and may even result in operating at losses and drop in service standard or even compromise safety due to poor bus maintenance, exhausted drivers, etc.</p>
              <p>Scenerio: each company got X no. of bus fleets and resources. Each of them are ambitious and wanted to expand and try monopolise the market and hence bid at a low price to try win more than 1 bid; if not, all 4 bids!</p>
              <p>Lets say 'A' company won 2 zones and its resources mutliplied by 2. 'B' and 'C' company won 1 zone each.</p>
              <p>In the next bidding exercise after a few years, 'A' company got to try harder to win back at least 2 zones as their resources are already there. If they win back only 1 zone, the remaining huge resource are gone into waste which they cannot afford to do so! Then, 'B' and 'C' companies are hungry for a bigger pie and bid aggressively too.</p>
              <p>Such intense competition would result in unhealthy price undercuts and eventually result in poor service and non-fulfillment of service standards. Employees are likely to be further pressurised in work, endure even longer work hours, got their salaries further cut etc etc. Note that history had shown how deplorable bus drivers' work conditions used to be, how the drivers even resorted to puncturing the tyres or trying to make the bus breakdown in order to find some rest! and how overworked drivers caused a significant increase of bus accidents.</p>
              <p>Despite a list of regulations and framework for bus operators to follow to safeguard commuters interests, i bet they would not care that much when it comes to bidding as they tend to worry more on whether they can win sufficient tenders to sustain their already available resources. Worse still, the bus market in sg is small and there are only 4 main bids available for tender and yet the amount of resources been expended on just 1 bid is overwhelming. Therefore, I feel that the bus industry is rather different from others such as construction industry and cannot be taken as a learning example when come to issues like bidding.</p>
              <p>I'd still support a duopolistic practice for the bus industry but with a tighter regulatory framework to safeguard commuters interest as well as the operators'.</p>

              <p>Recently, I have a crazy idea of whether different bus companies can operate on a route subjecting to passenger demand.</p>
              <p>For instance, SMRT can let SBS Transit "rent" 190's route from SMRT and they can dispatch their buses to ply the route. However, this is subjected to costs.</p>
              <p>Will that improve the current situation since SMRT is facing a shortage of buses?</p>
              <p> Just a crazy thought.</p>

              <p><br>Let's see...</p>
              <p>1. 1 service to duplicate S2 from Kallang to Tanah Merah<br>2. 1 service to ply between Tampines, Simei, Tanah Merah and Bedok stations<br>3. 1-3 services to ply from Tiong Bahru/Outram Park all the way to Jurong East at least<br>4. 1 service to ply between Buona Vista to Yew Tee via Jurong East<br>5. 1 service to ply between Yio Chu Kang to Novena at least</p>
              <p>That's my views for now.. One thing for sure the west needs more duplication IMO..</p>

              <p>Thus the rent comes about for the company who owns the route to earn the $$$. But then again, who will rent out a good route like 190 to other companies for them to earn the $$$.</p>

              i believe bus infrastructure got to improve as well in order to make public transport more attractive.
              poor examples are the bus-stops along Orchard and Bugis. Busy bus-stops got to be bigger and spacious enough to cater to large crowds esp in rainy weather. and sheltered walkways/footpaths/malls leading to bus-stops too.
              Suntec, Marina Sq (alighting stop for svcs terminating at Marina Ctr), Vivocity are examples of good bus-stop infrastructures.

              customers expect quality service standards yet cheap fares while operators expect profitable returns. Worse still, full fare paying passengers got to fork out more money to "cross-subsidise concession holders". And there are plenty of a group of full-fare paying passengers who earn little wages but yet not entitled to public transport vouchers. With concessions granted to children, students, senior citizens aged 60 and above amist the ageing population, just how many percent of the population are entitled to subsidy?
              
              it'd be ideal if our govt impose part of the taxes on car owners and use it to subsidise public transport. Public transport ought to be affordable and yet convenient to those who cant afford the luxury of owning a car.
