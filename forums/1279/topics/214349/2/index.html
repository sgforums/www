            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Commuters shouldn't be penalised when ez-link system breaks down</strong><br><br>I refer to the letter 'Passengers must use cash to pay fare when ez-link system is down' (ST Online Forum, Oct 13).<br><br>A majority of commuters pay their fares by using the ez-link card. In the event of a breakdown in the system on the bus, they are required to pay the fare in cash instead.<br><br>Commuters end up paying more since the fare is higher for cash payment compared to ez-link for the same fare stages.<br><br>Furthermore, if the passengers don't have coins in the right denomination, they end up paying more when they can't get back the change.<br><br>Hence the question is, will the transport company be motivated to maintain the ez-link system well, since its takings will be higher with cash fares?<br><br>The transport company has a duty to ensure that its ez-link system is functioning properly.<br><br>Commuters should not be penalised in any way as a result of the system's failure.<br><br>It has become a trend that whenever there are problems in public transport, the buck is often passed back to the commuters. This is not right as it is against the public interest.<br><br>This has to stop.

This includes providing its passengers with the option of paying the fares in cash or via the ez-link card.<br><br>The unavailability of the ez-link system on the bus constitutes a failure to deliver the service.<br><br>This should be viewed as a serious lapse on customer service as many commuters may not have the exact fare for the journey. They may have to pay more in cash because of this.<br><br>As SMRT is one of the two companies operating the bus service, the public is at its mercy when the company fails to deliver. This is an intolerable situation.<br><br>It is ridiculous that the public should be paying for the service failure of SMRT.<br><br>For its lapse in service, SMRT actually stands to gain extra revenue rather than lose revenue.<br><br>What incentive is there then for SMRT to ensure that its ez-link service is functioning properly at all times?<br><br>The Land Transport Authority should consider penalising public bus companies and close this loophole.<br><br>Public bus companies should be made to carry the passengers without charging them when it is their fault that they cannot accept a valid mode of payment with the ez-link card.

Otherwise it's unfair to commuters</strong><br><br>Bus commuters have just learned from SMRT that when "the ez-link system on board a bus is out of service, passengers would need to pay the fare in cash based on the number of fare stages they travel" (ST Online Forum, Oct 13).<br>The ez-link system was introduced in 2002 as part of the government's drive towards a cashless society.<br><br>Since then, commuters have been deprived of alternative fare payment methods on buses except by paying in cash.<br><br>But cash payment is not really an "alternative" since commuters are charged a higher fare when they do this.<br><br>For commuters, cash payment is a fallback option when they have problems paying the fare with their ez-link cards. They usually pay with the ez-link cards to avoid paying a higher fare.<br><br>Thus it is wrong for the company to demand cash as a fallback position when the ez-link system on the bus breaks down.<br><br>There is a danger of abuse when the ez-link system is deliberately made to malfunction and this obliges commuters to pay a higher fare with cash. This will result in higher revenues for the company.<br><br>Furthermore, commuters are unjustifiably penalised for a service flaw.<br><br>Commuters are compelled to either pay the higher fare in cash, or suffer productivity loss by waiting for the next bus.<br><br>So where is the responsibility of bus companies to maintain an acceptable level of service standard?<br><br>When the ez-link system is not working properly, the bus should not be deployed. And if the ez-link system breaks down in mid-journey, commuters must be offered a more equitable alternative.<br><br>Bus companies need to be able to handle such contingencies.<br><br>It is imperative that the Public Transport Council addresses this issue with the bus companies.<br><br>Law Sin Ling<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:1106101d6704e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=f832758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:1106101d6704e010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>
