However I think the bus drivers turned off the speed limiter, thus it goes faster. Where is the exact place where they change shift?

In March 2001, I took 170 home (obviously a B10M Mk II) from Woodlands Checkpoint after returning from Cameron Highlands but the bus simply zoomed all the way down as if it's on highway (it was around 2230 when I boarded the bus). No shift changing along the way! As for the other direction, SBS9818A had mentioned in the previous message.</div>

If you observe carefully, there is actually a small indent before the actual bus stop, and it can be quite common to see one or two service 170 Mk IIIs parked there with the desto. It is besides the railway, towards JB, however.<br><br>I agree with you that svc 170 buses like to speed near HCJC,....its very damn near my school, but only provided that there is no jam, unlike in the morning, sigh.....<br><br>I think that the speed limiter is just a dud in many buses, most of them are only good at giving out warning sounds only. If you take service 969 bendies, you would know what I mean. By calculation, I have recorded a 969 Volgren bendy doing 68.5km/h at night during weekdays ( no Kidding! ). Moreover, some Bendies and Lance 245s like to take Sembawang Rd as a scenic race track, and I would bet from experience that the speed exceeds 60 km/h.</div>
