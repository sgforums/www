              <p><br>The purchase of 200 B9TLs in 2006-07 doesn't seemed for any replacement, but rather for fleet expansion. That was also the time when SBST introduced a number of new bus services like 5, 45, 109, 175, 185 etc.</p>

              <p><strong>Order for 300 Volvo double-deck buses in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="intro">Volvo Buses has secured an order for 300 
                      double-deck buses from SBS Transit in Singapore with a value of about 
                      US$ 110 million. SBS Transit has once again opted for environmentally 
                      enhanced Euro V engines.</p>
              <p> SBS Transit is one of Volvo Buses’ most important customers. 
                      Since 1981, Volvo has delivered more than 1,700 buses to the Company. 
                      The last order was for 150 double-deck buses in 2009. With this order, 
                      Volvo has secured its position as the primary supplier of double-deck 
                      buses to meet SBS Transit’s new vehicle requirements into 2012.</p>
              <p>The order is for 300 double-deck buses built on the Volvo B9TL 
                      chassis. The chassis will be produced in Borås, Sweden, while the 
                      bodywork that is to be made by Wrightbus will be mounted in Singapore. 
                      Deliveries will commence in 2011 and be completed by end 2012.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit has opted to equip the buses with engines that comply 
                      with Euro V. It has not yet been decided when these requirements will be
                       introduced in Singapore, but this is the way for SBS Transit to show 
                      its continued commitment to environmental protection in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a first for SBS Transit, the buses will also be equipped with 
                      Volvo’s latest fleet management system, ITS4mobility. This system will 
                      allow SBS Transit to monitor the buses operational efficiency and also 
                      driver behaviour which will assist in reducing fuel consumption and 
                      general running costs.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gan Juay Kiat, said: “We 
                      have been renewing our fleet over the last five years to provide our 
                      commuters with a more comfortable and safer ride. The new buses are also
                       environmentally friendly, which is a key consideration for us.”</p>
              <p>“This order once again underlines the strong relationship built up 
                      between SBS Transit and Volvo Buses over many years of close 
                      partnership,” says Alec Bell, Volvo Buses’</p>
              <p>Area Director South East Asia. “The quality provided by the B9TL 
                      chassis combined with Wrightbus bodywork provides SBS Transit with an 
                      environmentally advanced, solution that is fuel-efficient and reliable, 
                      best suited to Singapores demanding operations. This, together with 
                      Volvo Buses commitment to providing world class service and parts 
                      support provided the winning formula”</p>
