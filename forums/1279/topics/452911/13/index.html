              on the table. I'm sure they'll perform better than the MIC buses
              and be easier to maintain (SMB135E and SMB137A were allegedlly

              <p>I did mention as a reply 3 months back that AdBlue is needed to meet emissions standards for the engine. A Euro 3 engine that is used in a hybrid bus will still be a Euro 3 engine.

              <p>As for buses MIC, all of the demonstrators from china till date have their drivetrain and road components designed and made by western companies such as Cummins, ZF, Eaton or Dana.

              <p>I agree on the old buses point. I still appreciate the LO3X, B10M and VO3X even if they are old. They are certainly the best buses from the 90s that provide us comfortable rides for almost 20 years.</p>
              <p>But the SMRT ones are terribly maintained, even some of the bus models are good.</p>

              <p>yes, which is a diesel unit, i checked the king long website and i dont think its a diesel hybrid... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>update: i checked 1M on Transtar's King Long XMQ6121G, its a diesel unit, no motors unlike SMB137A. assuming its the exact same model as the one SBST got, the SBST King Long XMQ6121G is a DIESEL unit and NOT a diesel-electric hybrid unit</p>

              <p>Here are some things to highlight:</p>
              <p>1. Radiator positioning of the sbst unit is exactly the same as the white king long hybrid which is on the offside. On the Transtar's KL, its on the nearside, and much bigger in size.</p>
              <p>2. There is approximately 50-80cm of storage area between the last seat and the rear of the bus, which results in no rear windows. Again, both sbst's unit and the white king long hybrid shares this feature. The area is likely used to store batteries within. The transtar's KL does not have this storage area, and there are seats installed until the very end.</p>
              <p>3. The white king long hybrid has side panels which can be opened located after the front axle. Their purpose is also to store the batteries. This again is demonstrated on sbst's unit, and non existant on the transtar's examples.</p>

              <p>Everyone is welcomed to verify the facts, and draw upon your own conclusions.</p>
              <p>As for myself, based on the above facts and making an educated guess, i would say it shares enough similarties with the white demonstrator unit to say that this sbst unit is also a diesel-electric hybrid, and not a pure diesel.</p>

              <p>Just to add on to your observations, i saw the side facing seats after the right front wheel mounted on a "box" platform (seats mounted directly on the platform). Might be the batteries. It's still a low entry unit with zero step floor at the front half to exit door. i wasn't able to see if there's any similar box on the side facing seats behind the left wheel.</p>
