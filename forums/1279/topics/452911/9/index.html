                              <p>Why does every fucking discussion have to turn into a
              fight?<br>
              <br>
              Anyway, the XMQ6121G pdf that someone linked looks very different
              from this XMQ6121G.</p>
              <p>The model in the PDF is the exact model that Arriva Malta
              purchased. That is the European market model with all the bells and
              whistles - ZF axles, ZF/Voith gearbox and it comes with airbag
              suspension which is probably an industry standard in the EU by
              now.</p>
              <p>This one here is probably the Asian domestic market model - the
              rear is very different and since Asia does not come with air
              suspension requirements, this probably cheaps out with leaf springs
              instead.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day I highly doubt that this will be the final
              model that is purchased. The air suspension ones ride fine, but
              we're going to take a step all the way back to UD and Hino days if
              SBST were to order this one.<br>
              <br>
              Additionally, I don't see the issue with MIC buses. Have you guys
              taken a ride in them before?<br>
              <br>
              Sure, they make crap like those purple/blue coloured Golden Dragon
              midi-coaches. <br>
              Then again I don't see how Japanese buses are better than these
              actually. The suspension is crap (Japanese buses still using leaf
              springs), the engines are noisy and weak (sounds very Japanese,
              doesn't it?) and the gearbox grinds gears.</p>
              <p>I challenge you to take a ride on the ones that conform to EU
              specifications.</p>
              <p>Those with 10 wheel nuts (10 EU arrangement, not the American
              one; check out Wikipedia or go observe it yourself if you don't
              know the difference), air-suspension and integrated AC instead of a
              roof-mounted pod.</p>
              <p>One does not simply make a sweeping statement that all MIC buses
              are bad, especially when you consider there are King Long coaches
              in Singapore that have Denso A/C units, Italian FAINSA leather
              seating, a 330+ HP Cummins engine which sounds absolutely smooth
              even at the rear and a ZF 6-speed manual box.<br>
              <br>
              And yes, those coaches have self-levelling air suspension as
              well.</p>

              <p>A leaf sprung suspension would not be possible on a low entry/floor bus due to the space required to house the parabolic springs. The bare minimum would be a single step. Of course, do highlight any examples if u find any, as it's a breakthrough for disabled access in many parts of the world if a low entry/floor bus could be developed with just leaf springs.</p>
              <p>Click and expand the image in the first page of this thread. It's very clearly shown in the photo that the axles are by ZF, and thus air suspended.</p>

              <p>The raiser function depends very much on the type of controls installed to control air within the suspension air bellows, a more advanced Electronic Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) will allow a large range of features such as kneeling, ride height adjustments, etc. Otherwise, they could also fallback to a simple version like the O405 that has no controls, just a valve that ensures the bellows have enough air in them. That's right, if there was a raiser they should have used it. But since no one seen the dashboard yet, this will probably remain an unknown till the bus is in service.</p>
              <p>As for the pdf, it will definately look different as it's unlikely this unit completely follows the euro spec. The Malta units are actually XMQ6127G, although the front looks the same. There are only very few XMQ6121G in the world that uses the 6127G front, of the two i know, this is one, the other is the white hybrid.</p>
              <p>There is also a number of rather interesting things with this unit if u look very carefully. The engine area is extremely large and as u have mentioned needs vents at the rear, and even eats into the passenger area just like the double decks do. The only other 6121G example i could find was the taiwanese ones, but those have the airconditiong mounted there. The sides have a number of panels that could be opened, unlike most 6121/6127G elsewhere that does not have this feature. Again, only the white hybrid has them. So what could all this space be used for?</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is not just a diesel bus but the 6121G diesel-eletric hybrid that sbst had agreed to trial a year or two ago. And the spaces are all for batteries. We'll know soon enough...</p>

              <p>The raiser function depends very much on the type of controls
              installed to control air within the suspension air bellows, a more
              advanced Electronic Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) will allow a
              large range of features such as kneeling, ride height adjustments,
              etc. Otherwise, they could also fallback to a simple version like
              the O405 that has no controls, just a valve that ensures the
              bellows have enough air in them. That's right, if there was a
              raiser they should have used it. But since no one seen the
              dashboard yet, this will probably remain an unknown till the bus is
              in service.</p>
              <p>As for the pdf, it will definately look different as it's
              unlikely this unit completely follows the euro spec. The Malta
              units are actually XMQ6127G, although the front looks the same.
              There are only very few XMQ6121G in the world that uses the 6127G
              front, of the two i know, this is one, the other is the white
              hybrid.</p>
              <p>There is also a number of rather interesting things with this
              unit if u look very carefully. The engine area is extremely large
              and as u have mentioned needs vents at the rear, and even eats into
              the passenger area just like the double decks do. The only other
              6121G example i could find was the taiwanese ones, but those have
              the airconditiong mounted there. The sides have a number of panels
              that could be opened, unlike most 6121/6127G elsewhere that does
              not have this feature. Again, only the white hybrid has them. So
              what could all this space be used for?</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is not just a diesel bus but the 6121G
              diesel-eletric hybrid that sbst had agreed to trial a year or two
              ago. And the spaces are all for batteries. We'll know soon
              enough...</p>

              <p>Being a hybrid would not produce any cleaner emissions per liter of fuel used, the engine is still the same engine with the same emissions rating. The savings come from lesser fuel used due to regenerative braking and other optimisations. SMB137A does also come with an Adblue tank and requires it to meet Euro IV emissions standards.</p>

                      <p>Edit: Something interesting though, apparently they did decide to change the aircon to a denso unit on the original demonstrator. It was seen with denso aircon in china sometime back.</p>

              I don't understand why some people till now still discriminate China-made buses. I think its mainly biased. I believe the China bus manufacturers are eager to improve their products hence why our bus operators are still bringing in several models for trails and evaluation. With our bus operators feedback to the manufacturers, I'm sure they will look into their shortfalls and improve as I believe they are eager to do business with them. 
              
              If China-made buses are so lousy, then the private bus operators here wouldn't be buying more and more of them! Bus fare increase you all complain. Why can't our bus operators give them a chance to prove their products worthiness, increase competition among manufacturers and hopefully bring costs down? Already the Euro emission standards are cutting off some bus manufacturers and hence less competition when buying new buses. This was one reason back-then why SBST got to buy 1100 Scania KUB buses to replace their retiring buses.
              
              Aren't we using lots of mic products nowadays? clothes, household &amp; electrical appliances, building materials, solar panels, etc?
