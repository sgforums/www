            <div class='col-md body'>Did u guys realise that at Woodands Int, when 962 buses are at the boarding berth taking in pax, <strong>their exit doors will always be opened and then closed again almost immediately</strong>? This is especially true after the service has been VLS-ed. I do not see this occurence on other buses. So it leads me to conclude that this opening of exit doors is something gotta do with the VLS system? But why only 962?<br><br>And I'm getting irritated with the VLS on this service. When the buses already stop at the bus stops to alight pax, the VLS still have not updated the fare stage and still display the 'No Tapping" sign and thus, I juz have to get off the bus without tapping my ez-link. Wonder how the adult ez-link users are feeling. Luckily i use BCP. Have tried complaining to SMRT but situation is da same...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
