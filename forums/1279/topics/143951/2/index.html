I too follow all the transport news, but I guess I know nothing more than what they published on newspapers and websites.<br><br><blockquote><strong>As far as I know the bus operators are:</strong><br><br>RapidKL (absorbing former Intrakota and Cityliner buses)<br>Intrakota<br>Metrobus<br>Selangor Omnibus<br>Len Seng Bus</blockquote>Metrobus goes to mainly Subang Jaya, Selayang, Ampang, Serdang and Klang. Selangor Omnibus and Len Seng are decades old companies, the former is now serving KL - Kepong - Sri Damansara - Sungai Buloh - Ijok - Batang Berjuntai - Kuala Selangor routes, while for the latter, around Setapak, Jalan Genting Klang and Wangsa Maju only.<br><br>In the previous round merger (around 1995), it was said that 8 bus operators have been merged into 2, namely Intrakota and Cityliner. Sri Jaya and Tong Foong joined Intrakota, while the rest, ermm, can't really remember.<br><br>As for Len Bus (Gombak &amp; Rawang) and Foh Hup (KL - Kajang - Seremban), I think they didn't join Intrakota or Cityliner in the previous round of merger, but were later defunct due to financial constraints.<br><br>There are also other small operators which sometimes I get to see around Central Market (Pasar Seni). There's one Sri Indah that goes to Kajang, a Megacoach that goes to Rawang and Tanjung Malim. These might be long-haul non-express bus.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Intracity Train operators:</strong><br><br>RapidKL (taken over Putra and Star lines)<br>KL Monorail<br>KTM Komuter (well not exactly intracity as their lines go as far as Rawang, Seremban and Port Klang)</blockquote>Yes, basically it's right to say there are 5 rail-based systems in Klang Valley, namely KTM Komuter, Star, Putra, Monorail and Express Rail Link (ERL).<br><br>Among the different system, there are still levels of difference in terms of targeted audiences. KTM Komuter covers the length and width of Klang Valley (as far as where tracks go), Star and Putra are urban LRT, Monorail serves city center while ERL serves airport as well as the new growth corridor in between city center and airport.<br><br>As suburban service, Komuter should have lower frequency but bigger coverage than LRTs. With more fundings coming from the govt to repair the out of order Electric Multiple Units (EMUs), more can be brought back to service, in order to increase the frequency to every 10 minute in the near future, from the current every 15 or 20 minutes usually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>With more systems serving different markets, the integration between systems has become a great issue. I would say that the early plannings were not as thoughtful, but with hubs such as KL Sentral and Bandar Tasek Selatan being built, and more mini KL Sentrals being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">proposed</span> to cater for future expansion, things <span style="text-decoration: underline;">might</span> get better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>The recent takeover of public transport systems by govt involved the 2 LRT lines, Star and Putra, together with 2 biggest bus companies Intrakota and Cityliner, forming the new Rapid KL with a Dutch as CEO.<br><br>Monorail was a private funded initiative, they didn't get much help from the govt at large, with their only supporter in the govt being former Premier, Tun himself.<br><br>They had faced numerous interruption from govt in the process of construction, and their stations which are supposed to be interchanges to existing LRT stations are not located close enough to provide seamless transfer.<br><br>Another complaint about the monorails being, building their stops above roads, some of these stations do not act as a pedestrain crossing for non-monorail passengers. However, they are the most aggressive in terms of advertisement campaign and promotion.<br><br><blockquote>Wanted to put in this list, but I don't think KLIA Transit and Express belongs there. Correct me if I'm wrong.</blockquote>When the urban area expands, there comes big conurbations incorporating several big cities, each comprising different cores and satellite towns. So whether regional services such as Komuter and  KLIA Transit fall under the category "Intracity".<br><br>HK is made up of basically 3 main administrative districts, HK Island, Kowloon Peninsular and New Territory, each with own urban council or local administrative body. HK's MTR and Airport Express crawl thru all 3. Singapore is cut into 5 CDCs too, so is MRT still an intracity system ? (who thinks NE, NW, SE, SW and Central CDCs being separate cities aniwae ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>But that's the definition of city from administrative perspective. From human habitat / settlement perspective, cities are formed when residents choose to settle down close to one another. In that sense, yes, KL, Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Klang, Putrajaya are all separate cities. However, with higher mobility, the concept of "One day commuting zone" has been introduced... So it's common for people to cross borders isn't it ?</div>

There's also a MegaCoach going to Rawang (or maybe Tanjung Malim ?) and a Seri Indah that goes to Kajang.
