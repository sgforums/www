            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe can say something about <strong>KTM Kommuter</strong> services.<br><br>There are 2 lines which will interchange <span style="text-decoration: underline;">around</span> KL Sentral (also Kuala Lumpur, Bank Negara and Putra). The 2 lines runs from Sentul to Port Klang and Rawang to Seremban.<br><br>Commuters will need to know which direction they are travelling to. In addition, at KL Sentral, which has 6 platforms, it is essential to know which platform is the right one. There are LED's to display such information throughout the station and platform.<br><br>While KL Sentral uses the 'island' configuration for platforms, most other stations use the 'side' configuration, with an overhead bridge linking up the 2 sides. Sometimes, the ticketing platform is often on the bridge itself.<br><br>Printed schedules are available for the arrival time throughout the day, and these trains, for the large part, adhere to the schedule very well, with observation deviation of not more than 5 minutes.<br><br>Nevertheless, during peak periods, trains do tend to be late, though i would not suggest arriving late thus. this is because the frequencies of the train lies anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. imagine missing a train or alighting at the wrong stop!<br><br>These air-conditioned trains are often packed due to the longer frequency, but it is their way of maximising returns, maybe. Seats are made of hard plastic with thin layer of 'furry' cushion, like those Vogel-Sitze's.<br><br>They travel at top speeds of nearly 90kph, and practically maintains this speed for most of the journey since the station-to-station distances are pretty far as u move away from KL itself. However, along the way, sometimes the train will slow due to track problems.<br><br>As with other interchanges in KL, they are never quite seamless. You have to exit from one line, walk the exit to another line, queue to buy another ticket and get into the line. In certain cases, you might have to walk up to 500m to another nearby station (Dang Wangi &amp; Bt Nanas) but other alternatives may not be more feasible.<br><br>Machines are available for dispensing of tickets, but other than KL Sentral, expect long queues for these tickets, especially at the interchanges. These machines accept a single note and multiple combination of coins. Change is available, if any. Manual ticketing kiosks are also around. Tickets are of paper with a magnetic strip type, much like the MRT concession passes last time.<br><br>An example. A ride from KL Sentral to Seremban will cost you RM6, and will take you about 90 minutes. (Not much difference from a coach ride). The distance travelled here is about 100km.<br><br>These trains are equipped with handicapped-friendly features.<br><br>You can differentiate these Kommuter trains from their Andarabandar counterparts from their bright yellow-coloured front and their 8-door passenger cabins.<br><br>Some info about other stations:<br>KUALA LUMPUR: The old main station for KL city. Nostalgic.<br>SUBANG JAYA: Alight here to go Sunway Lagoon. There's also Giant here.<br>SEPUTEH: This station is no longer in use. It is replaced by MIDVALLEY station a few hundred metres away, which opened early this year. (This map is not updated.)<br>NILAI: Alight here for a shuttle coach to KLIA, if you prefer the cheap way of not using KLIA Ekspres to get to KLIA.<br>(BANDAR) TASIK SELATAN: The interchange station between KLIA Ekspres, Star Line and KTM Kommuter.<br><br>Image courtesy of Wikipedia.org<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d9/KTMKomuter.jpg/300px-KTMKomuter.jpg"><br><br>KL SENTRAL.

The design and construction is from an Australian company, if I'm not wrong. The rail tracks are also the normal rail types u can find in SMRT, i.e. 2 rails plus a third electrified rail. It is operated by Syarikat Prasarana Negara Berhad (SPNB), which means it now comes under RapidKL, though it still retains its old nice livery.<br><br>Technicalities aside, this train is ultra noisy on the outside. Wherever it is passing by, you can find the ground vibrate. The viaducts and platforms vibrate even more, like as though the tracks are not straight at all or there is a lot of friction. It's nowhere near SMRT's. But interestingly it is relatively quiet on the train itself. It is air-conditioned, of course.<br><br>The line runs from Sentul Timur southwards to Chan Sow Lin, which is a double-platform, 3-track station. This is where it splits to 2 branches, one to Sri Petaling and the other to Ampang. The trains to 2 branches run alternately, thus there is no worry of having to wait too long. Frequencies are not really anything to worry about as the trains come fast, about 3 - 6 mins on non-branched sectors. It is unlikely that you'll ever need to travel to the branches, and they are residential estates anyway.<br><br>If I'm not wrong, fares range from RM0.80 to RM2.60 and they run from 6am to midnight. Machines are available for ticket dispensing (one note, multiple coins) or you can get one by queuing at the station control room.<br><br>To get to Pudaraya Bus station (for intercity coaches, incl those to Singapore and JB Larkin), Chinatown and Kota Raya, alight at PLAZA RAKYAT.<br><br>Image courtesy of Wikipedia.org<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2e/Star.png/300px-Star.png"><br><br><strong>Putra LRT.</strong> This line has since been under the RapidKL umbrella and all its trains have changed to new liveries. The new livery does indeed looks nicer. It was formerly also operated by Syarikat Prasarana Negara Berhad (SPNB). This line was fully operational by June 99, before the final 'piece', the KL Sentral station was opened on 1st April 2001.<br><br>The line makes use of Advanced Rapid Transit Mark II technology from Bombardier. The trains are comfortable but they tend to emit a frictional noise too.<br><br>This 29km line is the third longest fully-automated driverless metro system in the world. There are no branches on this line. 5 of the stations are underground, i.e. Masjid Jamek (interchange with Star), Dang Wangi (interchange with Monorel), Kampong Bahru, KLCC and Ampang Park. Only Sri Rampai remains closed due to undevelopment. A full-directional ride will take you about 45 minutes, but you get to get the full front view like the NEL.<br><br>Other than from Pasir Seni to Masjid Jamek which uses the cut-and-cover method, the other tunnels are bored type (round).<br><br>Here they use magnetic tickets like our old farecards. Fares range from RM0.80 to RM2.60, if my memory doesn't fail me. Like other lines, machines are available for ticket dispensing (one note, multiple coins) or you can get one by queuing at the station control room. Manual paper tickets are also available over the counter, but is losing popularity fast.<br><br>Image courtesy of Wikipedia.org<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/89/Putra_LRT_train.jpg/300px-Putra_LRT_train.jpg"><br><br>My favourite, the <strong>Ekspres Rail Link (ERL)</strong>.<br><br>This line was opened on 14 Apr 2002, with the Transit service commencing on 23rd August on the same year.<br><br>It is also known as KLIA Ekspres, but here can clarify what each means. ERL is the working name for the line, much like NSL and EWL. There are 2 services that run on this line, the KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit. there you see the difference. but many Malaysians like to refer it as the ERL.<br><br>These Siemens Desiro 4-car trains are powered by overhead pantographs and is manually driven. They run at a maximum speed of 160kph, and KLIA Ekspres can get you from KLIA to KL Sentral (or vice versa) in 28 minutes. They leave on the hour, 15th, 30th and 45th minute during peak hours and on the hour, 20th minute and 40th minute during off peak hours (10am - 4pm i think). KLIA Ekspres will skip all stations along the line.<br><br>KLIA Transit will stop at all stops along the route (Bandar Tasik Selatan, Cyberjaya/Putrajaya and Salak Tinggi). The journey will now take 36 minutes and they typically leave 5 minutes after a KLIA Ekspres train has left. Note that it is not cheaper to get from KL Sentral to KLIA (or vice versa) by KLIA Transit so please take KLIA Ekspres at KL Sentral. Salak Tinggi station is actually the depot of the line so no one would really stop there anyway. KLIA Transit trains are also less comfortable, and I think there are no LCD TV's for you to watch. Also, KLIA Transit has its own platform at KLIA, which is further for passengers but more convenient for staff.<br><br>Ticket costs RM35 for adults and RM15 for child under 12 for the KL Sentral to KLIA run. The ticket type is paper with magnetic strip. Note that from KLIA, if your train is leaving very soon, you can board the train first and tickets can be bought at KL Sentral itself as you need a ticket to exit through the gate.<br><br>Image courtesy of New Straits Times<br><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Weekly/TravelTimes/Friday/Destinations/20020920092322/Vocabulary/Images/Destinations/erl.gif"><br><br>Opened on Malaysia's National Day on 2003, the 8.6km, RM 1.2bln <strong>KL Monorail</strong> serves the popular south-eastern suburbs of the KL Golden Triangle. To get to KL Sentral Monorel station, you actually have to take a 200m walk out. These manually-driven trains run at a maximum speed of 55kph, and will bring you in air-conditioned comfort to the shopping and pubbing districts of Berjaya Times Square (Imbi), Bukit Bintang, Raja Chulan and Bangsar. One point to note, Imbi and Bt Bintang are very close to each other, but Imbi was built so as to allow a direct connection to Times Sq. thus, to get between the 2 places, just cross the road and walk through Sungei Wang Plaza.<br><br>Magnetic farecard tickets are only available over the counter, and fares range from RM1.20 to RM2.50. Trains run from 6am to midnight and frequency is erratic, and lies anywhere from 3 - 12 minutes. Platforms use 'side' configuration with a bridge on top or a underpass below the tracks.<br><br>Every station on the line is sponsored by one company for a specific period of time and their advertisements can be spotted extensively on the station.<br><br>Image coutesy of Wikipedia.org<br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/Monorail_Station.jpg/180px-Monorail_Station.jpg"><br><br><strong>TRAVEL PLANNER</strong><br><a href="http://www.putralrt.com.my/travel/plan_trip_from.asp" rel="nofollow">Here</a></div>
