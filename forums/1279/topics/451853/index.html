              <p>If you have taken 123 during Saturday nights in between Orchard Blvd and Queensway you can see that the demand is there.</p>

              <p>Sure. In fact 123 has many alternatives that could lead to less loading at time. Many alternate buses till Queensway Junction (7, 174, 106) and 105 right until Commonwealth. As soon as it turns to Queensway, if there is a 153 before it, the loading will again be poor. </p>
              <p>I think 123's main loading comes between Bukit Purmei Avenue and Tiong Bahru Plaza. </p>

              <p>You are correct about 43 and 88 - those 2 services have high loadage around ~50% of their route.<br>325, however is SD as it is a feeder that doesn't get more than 50 pax on each bus regularly.<br>156 - you are correct. They instead introduced 156A to relieve the Thomson crowd.</p>

              <p>Paya Lebar*, 88*.<br>Yes it is absoloutely true. Morning Peak hours only occur on 88's route to TPY from PSR. Why? NSL. Many people from the North-East Region have to take 88 to reach NSL. 72 otherwise isn't that popular since at Tampines there is already EWL and it reached YCK, not AMK. AMK is also a transport hub for many people to take rest as there is <br>Ang Mo Kio Hub. TPY to PSR has crazy load from AMK to Punggol ONLY. TPY's commuters doesn't usually work at North-Easy regions, therefore the downroute from AMK to PSR.</p>

              <p>88's load is so unbearable that only 3 buses from 88's fleet is
              SD. Yes all 3 are Scanias - Citaros does not perm since the crash
              load is too much of a trouble for citaros to handle.<br> 43 - However can accept citaros but it only gets uncommon camoes on
              weekdays but common on weekends since it is FULL SD on weekends ,

              <p>Moreover 43 has parallel route with 76 right from YCK road to
              Marine Parade and even 70 till Paya Laber. Hence, if either bus
              goes ahead 43 does not have much loading. It might make sense to
              divert one of these routes along the parallel roads. </p>
              <p>I have seen at Toa Payoh that 8 has crazy load - the queue at
              the very first stop is around 60-70 pax but 88 in morning peak does
              not have many takers at the interchange but might be getting full
              later. </p>
