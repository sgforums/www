How can the bus not smell. we are not expecting everyone to wear cologne, but dun wear yr BO to public buses, coz it is an enclosed space. spare some thoughts for other commuters. this is not bomboy or dhaka, where buses have no or just 1 door, and not even air-conditioned.<br><br>these third-world workers should learn some basic hygiene since they are now in a modern clean city like Singapore, and not retain their dirty habit of living everyday as if it is their own country. They should buy deordorant, one bottle is less than $3.00.<br><br>I pity the poor driver, or those who have to travel on this bus to and from work everyday. Simply unbearable. alternatively, these workers should just ride in their own bus hired by their company. all of the same smell packed in one bus... a world of their own, and thank god!<br><br></div></blockquote>You think you are what?! VIP ah?!<br><br>Did you learn how to ride public buses? And did you know what does a bus means?! It means a public vehicle (with regular stops) that is to be shared with everyone, regardless of their backgrounds! You shld learn to bear with it for a short while!<br><br>And this is not a place for you to share about racist thoughts, even if you are not happy with the environment onboard the sv67 bus!<br><br>Finally, in this passage, you "suggested" them to buy DOs......or ride in their own company buses.......This is TOTALLY ridiculous! You think these passengers earn enough $$$ for perfume or hire company bus ah? If they did, then maybe no need to take bus already!!!<br><br>So your posting here is TOTALLY SENSELESS!!! You better learn how to ride buses in an acceptable manner!!!<br><br>I tell you ah, last few years when I did took sv67 buses for many times, there is no such thing as BOs.......I think its your nose that has problem.........to that you "sensed" the sv67 bus "smelly"............do up with ur nose or else better stop complaining here!!!</div>

If you're a racist, chances are you'll not go very far in your life.<br>You think only them who have BO? you can't smell and don't know your own BO  smell btw. You might say they smell but you'll never know that you might smell even worse. What if you are more smelly then them? If others can tahan, why can't you? Maybe your nose-sh*t that smells............ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
