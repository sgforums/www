              <p>   A friend yesterday told me that he had to wait for 1 hr for bus service 502 to reach his bus stop at B04 jurong east avenue 1 . He said that 502 were scheduled to reach at interval of 19 to 26 mins as stated in the noticeboard . But yet on multiple evening this week esp thursday and friday night he had to wait for 502 from 45 mins on thursday to 1 hr on friday . And from what he observed , he said that between 20:35 to 21:35 he saw multiple 502 buses turning left to PIE at the junction before bus stop B04 jurong east ave 1skipping a total of 6 bus stop from bus stop B04 jurong east avenue1 to B06 at boon lay way . Resulting in a few of the passengers including my friend , an elderly malay lady and 2 teenage girls having to wait very long for the bus service 502 at bos stop B04 jurong east ave 1 . After waiting for 45 mins , the 2 teenage girls had to take a cab to their destination while my friend and the elderly malay lady had to continue to wait for the 502 to come as they had to go to work using this bus service very often not to mention the remaining passenger at the remaining 5 bus stop down the road .</p>
              <p>  And finally when the bus 502 finally came at 21:35 my friend question the bus driver what was the interval of the 502 coming out for service , the bus driver replied that the PIE was severely jammed  . Being very familiar with the 502 route , he know that the 502 actual route never uses or even enter the PIE at any part of its journey nevertheless he ask the driver why your bus take so long to come ? The bus driver replied that " they "  ask him to come here to pick them up while other 502 driver just travel " halfway " then they hit PIE . Then trying to make the conversation short , he told the driver that he had waited at the bus stop from 20:25 to 21:35 . This the driver said he don't know . And my friend observed that when the driver reached one of celementi bus stop , the bus driver will deliberately remove the bus number plate from the front and back of the bus and whenmy friend alighted from the bus , he noticed that even the side number plate was also removed making it to be a out of service bus which proves that what the bus driver earlier said about purposely sent to fetch them were true . This happen both on thursday and friday .</p>
              <p> As a result of the delay of the bus , both the elderly malay lady and my friend were terribly late for work .</p>
              <p>  Can anyone explain why this is happening ? Someone from SBST care to answer this ? My friend was fuming mad yesterday when he told me . He said that everyone are paying money for all bus service trusting it to come at usual time to send them to their destination , but this is way too much . Everyone knows that supervisor don't really entertain the excuse of bus coming late as a valid excuse for being late . How can bus driver skip bus stops as and when they like to ? Or is it because they are following instructions from someone " higher up " there whom feel that they can just " modify " any bus route to suit their own pleasures ?</p>
              <p>  I really hope someone can take action to stop this nonsence immediately and give all of the passenger who had to wait 1 hr for the bus service a good reason as to why this is happening ? Particularly the elderly malay lady whom had to wait at a bus stop for 1 hr after that having to rush like hell to her work place after alighting from the bus .</p>

              <p>Such things does not happen on 502 only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, all bus services, if severely late, do reserve a right to make it off service. (As an email by SBST said so, maybe they just entertain me only)</p>

              <p>Ya this is what i find about express 502. When you use iris next bus they will show you the arrival time , but seconds later they will give you another update saying the bus will be delayed. But the bus will never arrive. Is it because SBST is just finding excuese? There was 1 occasion at esplanade when i was waiting for 502 wanting to go to Jurong West , i missed the bus at 5.36pm ( but in the arrival timetable the bus is suppose to arrive at 5.33pm) , i used iris to check the arrival of the next bus , which shows that it will arrive in another 13 mins ( which is what the timetable shows , at 5.59pm) so i waited , but then a 5.59pm the bus didn't arrive , i used iris to check again , i was shocked when it says next bus 11 mins ( expect delay) , the first thing that come to my mind is? Have SBST withdrawn the 5.59pm bus? If yes , why iris doesn't says that , the 5.59pm bus never arrive!! Then i waited till 6.13pm as shown in the timetable , the bus STILL didn't arrive!! i was so irated that i boarded 960 instead , then i realised that 502 was behind , which is the 6.10 bus and there wasn't anymore 502 behind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do understand that this bus is often delayed due to jams at Orchard , but some drivers of 502 really like to keng and when it is delayed , the front bus will arrive together with the bus behind , like once 9016 arrived behind together with 9021. So i'm just wondering if SBST withdraw bus trips for express services as they like?</p>

              my idea is to remove the long loop. have a stopover point for svc 502 in the city area.
              As svc 502 is also going through several bottlenecks and if svc 502 is made to start from Marina Ctr terminal, all buses should not start from the terminal. Some buses should start from Orchard (bypass Orchard Turn/Somerset) in evening/weekend peak. 
              And LTA should address the problematic road layout at Somerset/Orchard Turn area.

              stop down the road .</p>
              <p>  And finally when the bus 502 finally came at 21:35 my
              friend question the bus driver what was the interval of the 502
              coming out for service , the bus driver replied that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">PIE was
              severely jammed</span>  . Being very familiar with the 502 route , he
              know that the <span style="color: #ff9900;">502 actual route never uses or even enter the PIE at
              any part of its journey</span> nevertheless he ask the driver why your bus
              take so long to come ? The bus driver replied that " they " 
              ask him to come here to pick them up while other 502 driver just
              travel " halfway " then they hit PIE . Then trying to make the
              conversation short , he told the driver that he had waited at the
              bus stop from 20:25 to 21:35 . This the driver said he don't know .
              And my friend observed that when the driver <span style="color: #ff0000;">reached one of
              celementi bus stop</span> , the bus driver will deliberately remove the
              bus number plate from the front and back of the bus and <span style="color: #ff6600;">whenmy
              friend alighted from the bus</span> , he noticed that even the side number
              plate was also removed making it to be a out of service bus which
              proves that what the bus driver earlier said about purposely sent
              to fetch them were true . This happen both on thursday and friday
              .</p>
              <p> As a result of the delay of the bus , both the elderly
              malay lady and my friend were terribly late for work .</p>
              <p>  Can anyone explain why this is happening ? Someone from
              SBST care to answer this ? My friend was fuming mad yesterday when
              he told me . He said that everyone are paying money for all bus
              service trusting it to come at usual time to send them to their
              destination , but this is way too much . Everyone knows that
              supervisor don't really entertain the excuse of bus coming late as
              a valid excuse for being late . How can bus driver skip bus stops
              as and when they like to ? Or is it because they are following
              instructions from someone " higher up " there whom feel that they
              can just " modify " any bus route to suit their own pleasures ?</p>
              <p>  I really hope someone can take action to stop this
              nonsence immediately and give all of the passenger who had to wait
              1 hr for the bus service a good reason as to why this is happening
              ? Particularly the elderly malay lady whom had to wait at a bus
              stop for 1 hr after that having to rush like hell to her work place
              after alighting from the bus .</p>

              <p><br>"Express" 502 is not really "Express" as I perceive it to be. There are some trunk routes that are more "Express" than 502. Frankly, 161 and 168 can be considered an Express service, for which it is a trunk service, fortunately, benefitting many more people in cost.</p>

              <p>The route of Service 502 is too long, and it has to transverse
              Orchard Road twice! That explains why it is not as reliable as Service
              518.</p>
              <p>Another reason for the flexibility accorded to the way the
              service is run is because it is not a QoS-able service. Of course,
              homebound passengers from the city will be given higher priority
              because of that.</p>
              <p>However, you can expect an announcement soon on enhancements to this service to improve its reliability.</p>
