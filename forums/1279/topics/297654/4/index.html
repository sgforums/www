Not your grandfather's company. Its [b]main objective </strong>is to deliver higher returns to their shareholders.<br><br>Although you are right to mention that taking the bus is a daily necessity, too bad, at the end of the day, profit is still the main objective. If SMRT were to contract out more frequent cleaning services, its going to put a strain on the company's budget and it might affect their plans for fleet renewals.<br><br>Now now, you certainly dont want that to happen right? Im sure you would enjoy new buses as much as I do. A few layer of dust is unlikely to kill the passengers right?<br><br>So before you ask for more cleaning services, please think of the poor SMRT shareholders who are going to receive lesser dividends all because you want to travel in a dust free environment.<br><br>PS: I think you should buy some SMRT shares, maybe after you do, you wouldnt really mind the dust too much. I went on board 969 today and was shocked at how long the queue was at Tampines Interchange. I also noticed that only SMRT bay terminals were flooded with long queues, strangely, SS transit bays had not many long queues...[/b]</blockquote>long queue because bad frequency, you dont have common sense issit? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
