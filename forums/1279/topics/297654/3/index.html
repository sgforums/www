I was on Orchard MRT bus stop yesterday night, waiting for Service 700A or 190 from 2252hrs to 2300hrs, the following buses in sequence that I couldn't board due to "full house":<br><br>- TIB 595 H<br>- TIB 740 E<br>- TIB 515 P<br>- TIB 1116 B<br><br>Only until TIB 1083 L (Service 190) came then I can board, and by the next stop, the bus became "full house" again and caused a 5 minutes delay at that bus stop due to passengers overflowing<br><br>They should convert 80% of their current split shift bendies to full day or PM shift because the demands at night is simply went too overboard and insane until a passenger boarding the same stop as me, complained to the SL that he waited for half an hour before he can board. -_-</div>

No need to care abt passenger comfort and service reliability if profits are not met<br><br>Yeah it's not my grandfather's co, but if it can't even put commuters 1st, sorry then it should give up running public utility facilities like public buses and MRT.
