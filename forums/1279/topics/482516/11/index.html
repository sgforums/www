              <p>SMB56A (172AM05) left CCK INT late at 0811hrs..and TIB829J (172S106) left CCK INT at 0815hrs (on time). TIB829J BC was driving the bus as though he is flying along CCK AVE 1 and OLD CCK RD. End up TIB829J caught up with SMB56A at Opp Tengah Air Base stop, with less than 10 pax onboard. TIB829J was at least 5 mins ahead of schedule. TIB829J followed behind SMB56A until at the bus stop Opp Nanyang Ave, SMB56A managed to go through the traffic light while TIB829J was held up by the red light.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, there is a jam just before the junction of Jln Bahar and Jln Boon Lay, causing the bus to "pull back the time" to be 1 min late when i got down at Blk 263 bus stop...</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, this is normal occurrence. Nothing to be taken aback. Morning peak hour frequency for this service is 9 min. With this being a looping service and the route being extensive and many crowded industrialized and schooling stations being serviced, I don't find any reason why it will not bunch after the crowds have gone. This is true especially since it is going back to Punggol. I also suspect why they make it looping service is they want the residents in Punggol field to take LRT rather than sbs 62. So by having such unpredictable timings of sbs 62, people will be more inclined to take LRT rather than wait for sbs 62 if they miss 2 buses at a go. I will be more surprised if there is no bunching given the above reasons. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I also do not like to see sbs 62 bunches. This LRT reason is already long confirmed by those residents along Punggol field nearer to the plaza side. To connect to Punggol mrt, there is only the direct sbs 62 and direct LRT. Punggol field is considered a major road in Punggol but why only give 1 service to mrt??? Why? Please discount the fact that sbs 3 and sbs 83 made a big loop to Punggol mrt which people along Punggol field take due to no choice. My reasoning of bus vs LRT is therefore valid and is a long time suspicion of reason for those living there.</p>
              <p>As for residents along upper serangoon road (upper portion), yes I agree they do not have many services there are still flats ongoing construction. While those living on the other side have few services to connect to hougang nearby which has an alavanche of buses. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Your reasoning may be valid, but is not justified. There are many people who take sv 62 back home to Punggol Field from Paya Lebar, Hougang areas and if buses continue to bunch, they have to wait for 15-20 minutes for a bus and then 2 buses come together within 2 minute interval.</p>
              <p>The Punggol Field -- Punggol MRT section of the route is lesser than 10%. It is ridiculous for LTA/SBST to use such stupid logic.</p>

              <p><br>It is normal. The bunching of buses is higher with SD fleets. This is because there are specific stops, where the loading gets very high. You have many people boarding/alighting. At this time, SDs take more time than DDs on a bus stop. Same happens with sv 3. Seen many times in both directions towards Pasir Ris interchange, the loading is heavy. Bus goes like a snail with the bus behind catching up and then they travel together happily after.</p>

              <p><br>Coz it has 3A and 3B. There is no loading between Tampines and Pasir Ris (30-35 pax) and Pasir Ris - Punggol (40-50 pax). The need for DDs is only within Pasir Ris town covered by 3A and 3B.</p>

              <p><br>I would say not more than 50-55 pax... you see more than this... not sure... but maybe with more development coming in Punggol area.. in future most trunk services there might need few DDs... maybe you will agree with this.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, propose a sbs 3e semi-express service during peak hours only. From Punggol direction to pasir ris in morning, Punggol central -&gt; skip Punggol east -&gt; Punggol field -&gt; skip Punggol road -&gt; TPE (express) -&gt; skip all pasir ris (all skip) -&gt; pasir ris bus interchange terminate. In evening peak, pasir ris central (outside pasir ris mrt) -&gt; express until Punggol field and Punggol central and Punggol int. You can charge sbs 89e rates. The short journey can be as long as 45 min if you take sbs 3. Sbs 3e can shorten it to just 15 min. Those who take it very often will understand the agony. Cheers. </p>

              <p>I like your proposal just that I will not skip any stops within Punggol town. It should go express straight to Pasir Ris interchange by fastest route and then go express to Loyang ave and call at 2 stops along  Tampines ave 7 and terminate at Tampines cc along ave 2. PM service from Tampines cc in same way. 3 buses to start with should be okay... More timings can be added if loafing demands. </p>
              <p>i would also be temped to actually make it go via Simei road to Changi business park</p>

              <p>Of course it can have... But it is one of the services that LTA/SBST do not really care about.</p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>15-18 mins frequency</li>
              <li>Full Sd fleet</li>
              <li>No fleet add for at least 2 years in spite of BSEP </li>

              <div>I think they just consider 38 to be an alternative service to 12 and 229. Also now with Sv 20 introduced they have compensated frequency of Sv 38 with a good frequency on Sv 20.</div>
