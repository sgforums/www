              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, of course you are talking about tampines town
              which is conferred as the jewel of the east. It is a mature town
              and furthermore it is one of the major towns as far as east of
              Singapore is concerned. Moreover, tampines ave 7 is super close to
              what else? Singapore changi airport! It is one of the roads that
              leads to the expressway to airport. So it is not surprising to me
              that you can find high traffic even at wee hours in the night.
              Cheers.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Most people rather take 27 from Tampines Ave 4/5, then
                      go directly to PIE non-stop to the airport... If take 34, got to
                      take Tampines Ave 2, before getting onto the TPE, which means a
                      longer running time... Also, better frequency for 27.</p>

              <p><br> What I don't understand is how services leave interchange in
              bunched manner. See example of 333 above your post. It is such a
              waste to do that. Full route travel together and both buses not
              even seated capacity.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, yes first bus for sbs333 must be late already. So 2nd bus still has to leave as it is scheduled on time. It is not easy to withdraw the bus driver on duty at the very last minute for the 2nd bus. Moreover, along the journey, there may be too many people waiting at the bus stops. So when the 2 buses come together, some will choose bus 1 while some choose bus 2. You cannot expect people all flock to bus 1 as people are able to check the bus arrival timings through apps and they will know whether that bus service is being short-changed if it runs 1 bus lesser than normal. People will not understand that the first bus was late. Rather they will think of it as being irregular and point the finger at sbs transit for reducing the frequency if 1 bus is short. Cheers</p>

              <p>Ok if it is a service like 334 - completely agree. A service like 333 where am peak loading is 40-50 pax (on the higher side), bunching should be totally avoided. The easy way out would be since it was am peak to send the 2nd 333 bus off service from jurong townhall, east ave 1 to st 32 and do downroute from there instead of doing whole route. This way would have made up for the delay of first bus also. We need more creative ways of deployment by ground staff.</p>

              <p>Ok agree but i think they are not that reactive enough to every scenario that occurs. In short, they are not very spontaneous. They will just let it go and hope the 2 buses will settle the crowds along the routes and they will even out themselves. This is only possible if the 2 bus captains cooperate. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes this is very normal. Sbs transit expects bus drivers to help smoothen the crowd. In actual practise, bus drivers will not do anything extra. They will rather let it flow. Maybe because they are tired after such a long journey. Or maybe they dont care.</p>

              <p>My view on SBS Transit and SMRT services which have been reported with much bunching up incidents:</p>
              <p>I think 190 and 961 are okay... Not as much bunching up as before. Must say SMRT is improving the frequency manangement for both services... However, 851 still have bunching up sometimes, which is quite normal and there is somehow better control on the frequency now... For SBS Transit, 160 and 170 frequency is worst, very irregular due to WDL checkpoint... 51 is okay, now lesser chances of bunching up, despite the frequency.</p>
