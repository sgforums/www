              <p>All, yesterday 04-11-2016 service 118 8.41am depart from Punggol bus interchange was shit. Hate it when I heard the bus driver get instruction from system on the other line to slow down the bus so that the next bus will not be too far off. Shit lor Go Ahead Singapore.</p>
              <p>The bus driver said he left on time 8.41am and why need to purposely slow down when there are many people on board at this peak hour. The other side just told him to follow. Damn unlucky to be on such a bus when it drives like crawling speed almost all the way. On TPE, also crawling. End result is the next 118 caught up with him. Just damn unlucky to be on this bus.</p>
              <p>Go Ahead Singapore, please wake up la. You purposely tell people to drive super slow. Note many people on board will be affected. Worse another 118 will catch up and bunch. So what is the rationale? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, next time when I take such a bus with special instruction given to the bus driver broadcast, I will alight and take the next bus.

              <p>All, yesterday 04-11-2016 service 118 8.41am depart from Punggol
              bus interchange was shit. Hate it when I heard the bus driver get
              instruction from system on the other line to slow down the bus so
              that the next bus will not be too far off. Shit lor Go Ahead
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>The bus driver said he left on time 8.41am and why need to
              purposely slow down when there are many people on board at this
              peak hour. The other side just told him to follow. Damn unlucky to
              be on such a bus when it drives like crawling speed almost all the
              way. On TPE, also crawling. End result is the next 118 caught up
              with him. Just damn unlucky to be on this bus.</p>
              <p>Go Ahead Singapore, please wake up la. You purposely tell people
              to drive super slow. Note many people on board will be affected.
              Worse another 118 will catch up and bunch. So what is the
              rationale? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>3 weeks ago , I was on board Sv854 to Yishun from bedok. On board the bus I notice that the OCC display was Orange which meant he is late liao buy however the fking bus driver drive so slowly that I alighted and take the one behind it that was 1 min away . BTW the OCC did not call the bus driver to drive this slow but he himself drive this slow . Seating behind the slow poke bus , the driver of  second bus also drive behind the first bus and follow him until yio chu kang road where the second bus I take just overtake the 1st one and Chiong all the way to Yishun . The 2nd bus (slow one ) arrived at yishun 20 mins late . </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, you will not see customized loadings for every bus for SD and DD exactly to what most people want. Sometimes SD gets many people and DD gets few people. There is no such thing as exact loading for exact type of uses. By the way, 43M is here to stay. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
