              <p>Being a Bus Analyzer, indeed full fleet DD is a great way to go. Less space taken up but still with high capacity. Since trunk route so staying at upper deck is more feasible. And ya there are shortworking to address the high demand at little demand. (67W I think). </p>

              <p>Being a Bus Enthusiast, PLS LAH STOP MAKING OUR BUS SERVICES INTO CANCER!!!! I dam sick and tired of full rojak B9TL Fleet Sia. 180 lah. My as well give the service to SBST (ik that's not how the BCM works). Pls lah stop making our trunk routes boring. </p>

              <p>What you are highlighting is "boredom".. I would say count your blessings that 180 is full fleet DD... unlike 969 that gets rigids with 60 pax standing long distance... 180 also used to have a full fleet bendy fleet before, was it not "boring" then?... There are many services that have full fleet Citaro fleet... why are you stuck with 180?? You are complaining about something v trivial. </p>
