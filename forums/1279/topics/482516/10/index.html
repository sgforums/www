              <p>Not really bunching, but my observation today...</p>
              <p>Was queuing for 300 (at around 2.20p.m.) and the queue grew damn long, because no bus came 5 minutes after TIB534J left the interchange! Then, after 8-10 minutes, SMB3050X came into the berth and you know what? TIB887R was actually waiting behind the MAN? But, most of the passengers squeezed into the pathetic MAN and not more than 20 people boarded TIB887R behind!!! I decided to board the bendy, because it would be dumb to be squeezed like mad! Throughout the whole route, TIB887R ended up carrying at most only 50-60 passengers, and the BC (300AM01 BC, his last trip) had to slow down and crawl along Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, to prevent bunching up with SMB3050X (which was practically filled to the brim), although some people spotted TIB887R behind and boarded it (my bus) instead.</p>
              <p>What is this? SMRT doing stupid planning, why let the rigid go first and let the bendy be a backup and go to waste when it can carry more passengers?! The BC said I would only understand this kind of planning when I'm older. Well, not to offend the driver, but can't I tell SMRT to correct their terrible planning, by giving my suggestion about this?</p>

              <p>Ikr... but most of the time from what i observe, the bus/buses behind will just trail behind, sometimes "hide" behind. Blame it on the high number of buses for just a route of 6.3km with 40 mins run time per trip..</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3688Y, this is quite a normal occurrence. One thing I have learnt is when the first bus is usually crowded, it is always better to take the next bus (if you want a comfortable ride with a seat at least). This is true for the winding sbs 3. The second bus tends to catch up with the first. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3688Y, this is quite a normal occurrence. One thing I
              have learnt is when the first bus is usually crowded, it is always
              better to take the next bus (if you want a comfortable ride with a
              seat at least). This is true for the winding sbs 3. The second bus
              tends to catch up with the first. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3004X, frankly speaking, I think the route is not well-planned. Too many turning into those small roads (pasir ris st 71, pasir ris st 21, tampines at 21). Only service plying these roads. So called sacrifice 1 service to do all these connections. No choice! HGDEP controls also may not be useful. Cheers</p>

              theres not enough DD buses to be deployed. also i believe this to be the reason why some sv are still not getting upgrade to DDs.

              but prob is ppl dun know if there is another bus following behind or not. and sometimes the empty bus behind may overtake the front bus and skip that bus-stop.

              <p>I tend to agree to your statement... Hence, you see only few services getting upgrade like 54 but at the same time see more services getting downgraded like 166, 225, 196. Clearly LTA/SBST need to get more DDs as even services like 10 are only getting Sd fleet adds when they should get DDs instead.</p>
