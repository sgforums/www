              <p>Service 28 seems to have bunching issues too. Yesterday was SBS6642J and SBS9422H, and today was SBS9624S and SBS3233B. I've also seen SBS9509S and a Citaro (can't remember which one but it's one of the perm 28 Citaros) bunching on Sundays.</p>
              <p>But yesterday was really bad. Strangely enough, a CDGE (probably a BRBP 88 CDGE) was off-service at the bus stop near SPCA. Then it drove off with service 28 on the EDS. Not sure whether to board or not, so didn't. Half an hour later came SBS6642J and SBS9422H... I would later see a CDGE on 28 in the opposite direction. Likely the same bus as the one that was off-service and then with service 28 on the EDS.</p>
              <p>Bunching seems to be pretty common though. Considering some bus services have such high loading that they have very large fleets for their route lengths... just didn't think service 28 was that bad.</p>

              <p><br>45A has only one DD running in the AM. There are still 6 other DDs that do sv 45 full route. That is because of the massive loading from first stop of Lor Ah Soo near HG Ave 1 towards Serangoon in AM. 45-50 pax can easily board at just that one stop, and with second stop already bus crosses 70 pax. Makes total sense, buddy!</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, bunching of sbs 62 does not mean that there is excess capacity. Others observed the bunching of 3 buses of sbs 62 at one occasion does not mean anything. It is not because of capacity problem. It is more of a scheduling issue for a looping route. If every person in this forum just happens to see bunching and another calls for removal of buses, the situation will become chaotic and many buses from many services will be withdrawn. Surely that is not the right way!!! Cheers</p>
