              <p>This occurrence happens very often on Sv 147 also during am peak. I have spotted multiple times at Bendemeer 3 DDs on 147 back to back.</p>
              <p>in such cases, one of the be should overtake and go ahead and pick pax but no. Most of the times, they will tail the bus in front... Bus in front having high boarding/alighting taking more time, and the buses behind empty. Some BCs are also notorious to keep 1-2 other buses in between so that ppl don't realize there is the bus at the back. I just don't understand this kind of logic.</p>

              <p>172 today met with delays during evening peak. Was waiting for 172 at before Nanyang Ave stop towards cck int at 6.50pm. No bus came until 7.15pm, when TIB715D (172AP03) came into the stop, packed. All pax managed to board the bus but was already to the door. Bus was driven by new driver with mentor onboard kept asking pax to move in, and alight the bus, tap the bus body to signal pax to move in. When i board the bus, it was 40 mins late.</p>
              <p>Soon, SMB5Y (suspected 172AP04) overtook TIB715D at Aft Lim Chu Kang Stop, half full, while TIB1050G overtook TIB715D at opp HTA, with less than 5 pax on board.</p>
              <p>At blk 204 bus stop along CCK Ave 1, all 3 buses bunch together in this order: SMB5Y, TIB1050G, TIB715D...</p>

              <p>3046A bunch with KUB on Sv 64, when turning towards Dhoby Ghaut from Clemenceau. Observed 3046A drove quite fast and took sharp turn on Orchard rd when the signal turned amber. I was wondering why bc didn't wait for signal to turn red and wait for 2 mins rather than sticking to the KUB right in front. KUB had a few standees - must be around 40-50 pax. 3046A was empty. May be 10-15 pax on board. Maybe all the way till a Sims this will be the fate as it is right behind the KUB. </p>
              <p>I wonder if SBST/SMRT give BCs any training on how yo manage the situation when there is a bus of the same number right in front. As per me, bc should either overtake bus in front yo take more pax and help bus in front with loading and timing OR keep 2-3 mins distance with bus ahead to collect some pax at stops rather than going empty.</p>

              <p>But I still see mostly SBST bc not bothering about bunching because I think they feel that even if they don't take pax, there will be a bus behind due to improved frequency.</p>
