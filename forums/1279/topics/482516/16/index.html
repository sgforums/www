              <p>Agree and whenever I have taken 45 I have seen ppl boarding
                      along AMK Ave 10 and taking it to Lor Ah Soo, people boarding at
                      Serangoon alighting around Eunos and Bedok areas. Lot of long
                      distance travelers, so I will not be surprised if sv 45 gets more
                      DDs (at least SD --&gt; DD conversion very much possible). Also, I
                      noticed 45 loading has increased in both directions.</p>

              <p>only svc from NYP, ITE, Anderson JC and AMK Ave 10 to Serangoon.. Also only bus svc from Lorong ah soo to Kaki Bukit.</p>
              <p>I study at NYP and i take 45 daily. DD always come at wrong timings (Where pax can board easily) While SD always comes when the bus stop is already packed</p>

              <p>I have been observing two to three 179 buses come at the same time in the morning at around 7:20am. Sometimes, one or two relatively empty 179A buses drive pass a outside-NTU-campus bus stop, which I feel that it is a waste of resources.</p>

              <p>Bro.. sv 179 has one of the best frequencies ever... you have a bus every 03 minutes that too DDs and most DDs in AM run empty back to Boon Lay (that means enough capacity for Pioneer Rd North residents to Pioneer MRT)</p>

              <p>It is still necessary <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">to operate</span> 179A , especially during the AM Peak. This is to cater the heavy crowd heading into NTU. <br><br>However, I do agree that there is a need to cap the no of 179A trips, in order to cater the heavy crowd along Pioneer Road North (Esp the BS @ Blk 840) during the AM peak. Poor people at this BS, doesn't have any other alternative service and they are seeing empty 179A passing through.Their frustration is definitely understandable compared to some meaningless complain over why there are lesser 179A operated but more 179 operated on that particular day. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Overall, 179A is still short working trip and the main focus should be operating the full route.</span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </span></p>
              <p>I will suggest you to write in to LTA and SBS about this issue, so that they can look into your feedback.</p>

              <p><br>Sometimes due to traffic conditions and heavy pax loading, there might be some instances where several 179A buses bunched together. This result in the pressure on the subsequent 179 buses which operate full route.</p>
              <p><br>Thats why there is no need for this service to receive additional bus under the BSEP scheme. </p>

              <p>Based from observations and also from e-timetable from SBS Transit, there are many downroutes that start from WKWSCI Bus Stop which I felt it is unnecessary as sometimes 2-3 buses might bunch together and result in mostly empty buses and irregular frequency. 179A is still important as mentioned by some, I think more should be allocated to Service 179, if not some of the downroute start at Lee Wee Nam bus stop and still retaining some at WKWSCI Bus Stop to cater students mostly from the South Spine.</p>

              heading into NTU.<br> <br> However, I do agree that there is a need to cap the no of 179A
              trips, in order to cater the heavy crowd along Pioneer Road North
              (Esp the BS @ Blk 840) during the AM peak. Poor people at this BS,
              doesn't have any other alternative service and they are seeing
              empty 179A passing through.Their frustration is definitely
              understandable compared to some meaningless complain over why there
              are lesser 179A operated but more 179 operated on that particular
              day. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Overall, 179A is still short
              working trip and the main focus should be operating the full
              route.</span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </span></p>
              <p>I will suggest you to write in to LTA and SBS about this issue,

              <p>Based from observations and also from e-timetable from SBS
              Transit, there are many downroutes that start from WKWSCI Bus Stop
              which I felt it is unnecessary as sometimes 2-3 buses might bunch
              together and result in mostly empty buses and irregular frequency.
              179A is still important as mentioned by some, I think more should
              be allocated to Service 179, if not some of the downroute start at
              Lee Wee Nam bus stop and still retaining some at WKWSCI Bus Stop to
              cater students mostly from the South Spine.</p>

              <p>to be frank, as a frequent traveller on 179/179A, this timetable is not really strictly followed... I see 179A starting from Hall 1 bus stop or school of CEE...they dun really start at a certain stop though most 179A buses will still start at WKW stop..</p>
              <p>Some of the BCs will see where the demand is at and stop accordingly while some selfish BCs will just hide and follow "secretly" behind another 179/179A...</p>
              <p>And it is definitely necessary to start downroute at WKW for both 179/179A...students from south spine sometimes have to wait for 3-4 buses as they were already packed from LWN and school of CEE stop..this is especially evident between 5-7pm</p>

              <p>During certain time in AM peak, there is a bus every 05 mins to Serangoon. Maybe because of that bunching will be more common.</p>
              <p>I remember 3 years back sv 43 had a horrible frequency of 20-22 minutes with only 17 buses, out of which only 2 DDs. Huge huge improvement since those days!! Now totally 27 buses... </p>

              <p>to be frank, as a frequent traveller on 179/179A, this timetable
              is not really strictly followed... I see 179A starting from Hall 1
              bus stop or school of CEE...they dun really start at a certain stop
              though most 179A buses will still start at WKW stop..</p>
              <p>Some of the BCs will see where the demand is at and stop
              accordingly while some selfish BCs will just hide and follow
              "secretly" behind another 179/179A...</p>
              <p>And it is definitely necessary to start downroute at WKW for
              both 179/179A...students from south spine sometimes have to wait
              for 3-4 buses as they were already packed from LWN and school of
              CEE stop..this is especially evident between 5-7pm</p>
