              <p>During certain time in AM peak, there is a bus every 05 mins to
              Serangoon. Maybe because of that bunching will be more common.</p>
              <p>I remember 3 years back sv 43 had a horrible frequency of 20-22
              minutes with only 17 buses, out of which only 2 DDs. Huge huge
              improvement since those days!! Now totally 27 buses... </p>

              <p>Today, bus arrival towards Punggol from Yio Chu Kang Rd at 1pm was:</p>
              <p>43: Next Bus: <strong>26 min</strong> (WAB) (Unknown, should be non-WAB) Sub Bus: <strong>32 min </strong>(WAB) (SBS3004X)*</p>
              <p>43M: Next Bus: 17 min (WAB) (SBS6499G) Sub Bus: 31 min (WAB) (SBS3434M)*</p>
              <p>The first bus 43 was supposed to arrive at 1:20 pm. The subsequent bus was supposed to arrive at 1.40 pm. One bus early, another bus late. This could be the cause of frequent bunching.</p>
              <p>*Regos are according to schedule. There may be cameos.</p>

              <p>Today PM, two sv 70 buses bunch together along YCK Link towards Serangoon. First was SD that was packed with many standees, followed with WEG that also from outside seemed to have good loading (must be 50-60 pax).</p>
              <p>Was surprised to see that kind of high loading on 2 buses on sv 70 in opposite direction to peak direction. </p>

              <p>This is a classic problem here. Even if you see the same number bus right behind, still everyone want to push and squeeze into the first one. Better what, the BC in bus behind will not overtake the bus in front. Bus 1 will be late, bus 2 will tag along, soon bus 3 will come and kiss them. Classic bunching because of commuter and BC behaviors. I have observed this pattern multiple times during AM peak with sv 147. You see 3 DDs coming together like a small train. </p>

              <p>4 bus bunch on service 199 on 180215 @ 0930 at the circle near to NTU Jalan Bahar entrance towards BL (the circle aft Hall 11 stop)..</p>
              <p>They were in this sequence: SBS9548D, SBS3120T, SBS7402D, SBS3129U</p>
              <p>SBS3070D passed by them in the opposite direction. All 4 BC signalled something to SBS3070D BC. SBS9548D BC signalled a tired expression (probably late), SBS3120T BC smiled, SBS7402D BC used his hand and showed 4 and pointed to the back (possibly meaning 4 buses together), SBS3129U BC shaking his hand (meaning no passengers)...quite funny...</p>
              <p>By the way, SBS3070D should be behind SBS3129U...and all 4 buses were close to empty coz they are exiting NTU in the morning and not many people will take 199 out of NTU in the morning..but SBS3070D is packed...</p>

              <p>Major bus bunching on sv 190 at Somerset MRT between 21.05 and 21.15</p>
              <p>21.05 - SMB1464 (bus came with standee and around 5-6 pax boarded, others went for DD behind)</p>
              <p>21.05 - SMB5033 (18 pax boarded) </p>
              <p>21.06 - TIB894U (this bus was bendy downroute from Somerset MRT, was waiting in the bus lane for 4-5 minutes). There was a lady ground staff at Somerset MRT stop taking notes. She got really angry at BC because could see her telling him that why did he start bus when there was a SD and DD right ahead. I think he said it was his scheduled time. Not a single pax boarded bus, but during conversation one lady went to board, saw bus totally empty and did not. Bus left stop totally empty as there was another bus right behind.</p>
              <p>21.07 - unknown MANA22.. I think number was ending with 33 but could be wrong as it came and there was a 174 that stuck to it very close, so could not read. But 2 pax boarded (incl lady who did not board bendy)</p>
              <p>21.11 - SMB5011X (around 14 pax boarded)</p>
              <p>21.14 - SMB5038U (around 12 pax boarded bus)</p>
              <p>So 6 buses in a span of 09 minutes, that is less than 2 mins frequency between buses.</p>
              <p>I am sure commuters on 190 not complaining anymore. Between all this only 1 972 DD came that seemed to be fully seated and around 8 pax boarded bus.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>What 190 need is convert those 5 SD slots to DD and gradually convert all bendy to DD when the A95 coming in..972 so far excellent,No complain!700 maintain as it was..On the other hand 187 need 8 SD convert to DD.</p></div>

              <p><br>Hmm..true..but could also mean other areas have longer waiting time.. For example: Just now around 8 plus at night at bukit panjang (blk 184), i missed TIB1215Z (fully seated with few standees) and had to wait for around 10 mins before SMB5013R came, fully packed upon arrival and fully seated with few standees upon leaving stop..</p>
              <p>Well, just saying..coz 190 is like that...traffic conditions along Chinatown and Orchard can cause many buses to bunch, similarly may also cause extended waiting time. Also, do realise even though they bunch, the number of pax picked up is still significant..so if the wait is extended, the bus (even DDs) will not be able to take in all pax, esp when the bus reaches Thong Teck Buliding...</p>
              <p>Therefore, i agree with user carbikebus, its not about the number of buses, its the capacity of the buses...SMRT should stop deploying MAN A22 on 190... i will often see 190 buses (bendy or rigids alike) full by the Lot One stop towards NBR, normally if the wait is more than 10 mins (especially Sundays).</p>
              <p>Well, im not complaining though, so cheers :)</p>

              <p>Agree. All I am saying is sv 190 frequency and capacity has been beefed up in a good way. I keep pulling shots at SMRT for lousy operations on 172/187/851/857. But in this case, SMRT has taken serious steps to improve sv 190 and it is visible. </p>
              <p>So a job well done. Expecting it to improve its other services at a faster pace now. Cheers!</p>

              <p>This is picture of 190 at 20.26 hours. 5888H came and was already packed to door. Only 4-5 pax could board. In 02 mins, 3532H came along, which also had standees, but people could board. Bus was full. This was followed by an unknowm MANA22 which has 3-4 standees when it left Somerset MRT stop. Surely by Scotts road, all 3 buses must have been packed to door. </p>
