              <p>now dun have big cardboard hung with cable tie.. those small size cardboard screwed at bus stop pole or just put in the bus stop pole glass panel... i saw the sv76 notice inside the glass panels at some AMK Ave 4 bus stops. not visible at all. last time when they have the bigger size poster, it is easier to see.. and those bus stops along Ave 4 on the return journey (to yck) DOES not have the sv76 notice at all..</p>
              <p>also, the positioning of the bus stop is also weird... at AMK Ave 4 blk 612 bus stop, the pole is on the grass patch (1m from the pavement)... who will go walk on the grass to read the notice on the pole?</p>
              <p>btw, they also did not reprogram the Sv76 EDS after the amendment. Previously, they have YCK to Siglap Road (loop). now they just use back the old EDS which show YCK as the destination for both directions.</p>

              I didn't notice that, maybe someone can check it out. I don't even
              know who made that 315 banner in the other thread. Is the banner
              done by SBST or by LTA on behalf of SBST?</p>
              <p>But I find the distance fare ad at the bus stop pole hard to
              read and basically small on A5 sized board.</p>

              I think the sv 315 banner is put up by grassroots organisations, as the banner is hung along near the other community banners. Now that LTA takes over the route planning, its also involved with grassroots organisations for their inputs.

              <p>I'm disappointed that the SWT route no. is no longer displayed on the new bus-stop plates. I believe this can also be misleading for bus captains who is new to the SWT route, as they can refer to it to make sure they are still on track.</p>
              <p>Look at the former Jln Kayu bus-stops; the old bus-stop plates clearly indicate which directions the bus services are heading to. But look at the new ones; a commuter who is not familar may just board at the wrong bus-stop which takes them in the wrong direction.</p>
              <p>Also, there are no notices at bus-stops to warn passengers to look out for and board the bus heading to the correct direction such as Serangoon Gdn Circus, St Michael estate, Bedok Reservoir; and what the Red/White plate means.</p>
              <p>What is important is <strong>"UNDERSTAND AT A GLANCE"</strong> type of information panels, and not expecting passengers at the bus-stop to cross-reference to the individual route details or the small stickers below the pole to inform about SWT svcs.</p>

              <p>LTA to take over the bus central planning? I guess this is just going to be a start of disaster. They should keep their hands off from the public bus operations and scrap the territory rules and public buses to pay ERP. Just ensure that buses are safe, punctual, reliable and clean, will be enough.</p>
              <p>Let the bus operators be the judge of the routings, timings and demand handlings. </p>

              <p><br>I think the sv 315 banner is put up by grassroots organisations, as the banner is hung along near the other community banners. Now that LTA takes over the route planning, its also involved with grassroots organisations for their inputs.</p>

              <p><br>But I think that the banner is done by SBST, then approved by LTA before grassroots put them up. But putting banner isn't good and informative enough as compared to advertising them on all the bus stops that the old and new 315 plied. At least commuters have direct and first hand news on what the changes when they reach the bus stop.</p>

              <p><br>I think you should feedback to LTA about this. They have simply no clue that they are messing it up and making it worse for commuters to be more informative about the bus routes information.</p>

              <p>How am I going to explain abt bus route planning.</p>
              <p>Those routes you've like 169, 187, 188, 190 were all planned under SBS's hands. Those days if it was a monopoly, still ok.</p>
              <p>But right now, you're facing an issue where you've diff operators, the need to remove circuitous stretches on trunk routes as far as possible, being relevant to developements (i.e. SUTD, Aerospace Park, etc).</p>

              <p>ya, should scrap the territory rules as i think is anti-competition. I hope to see competitors penetrating into the northern area especially. should also scrap the ERP for public buses too, as public buses are in fact helping to reduce traffic congestion, but if they die die want $$, no choice la.</p>

              <p><br>It is in fact anti-competition, which results in residents living in the North having poor links. <br>And years back, a foreign transport consultant already states that ERP for cabs and public buses is stupid. Yet the govt gave another stupid reason to cover their source of extra income.</p>
