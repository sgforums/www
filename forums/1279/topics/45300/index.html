            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, Causeway Link is operational today<br><br>I first tried Queen Street terminal at about 1300 today, but found no Causeway Link buses. After that, I took 960 to Kranji<br><br>At Kranji, I found the Causeway Link buses. They are MAN citybuses, but I could not identify the model. After that, I met Hao Rui at Kranji MRT.<br><br>These buses have a simple front desto that says CW-1 in the middel and Larkin-Johor Bahru to the left and Kranji MRT to the right. Hao Rui suggested that it may be 18.XXX, and the bus was painted basically all yellow, and appeared to be Volgren bodied ( the boxy kind that those Transitlink buses have in JB ). The bus is cooled by Carrier and the AC vents inside are similar to those found in private buses ( those that you can flip open and close ). Hao Rui and I later took the bus to Woodlands custom for 80 cents Singapore dollar, and the receipts issued are similar to those of that in S'pore, but longer in dimensions. The anti-slip flooring is spotted blue in colour, and the vibration is quite audible in the bus<br><br>The gearbox used is the Voith, and the dashboard is very similar to that of the 0405, except that it has more dials and a large bold MAN lettering above the speedometer. However, the gear change sounded more like a ZF gearbox than a Voith one. The noise level is not as low as the company claim, and the engine noise is a cross between the DAF and an 0405.<br><br>The seats are as hard and uncomfortable as those of TIBS, is like those seats found in the Volgren 0405 and Lance 211, but the colour is yellow and blue, and the texture is smoother.<br><br>Interestingly, the speed limit of the bus is given as 90km/h, as seen from the rear sticker, and the speed of the bus  on Woodlands Rd. is noticeably faster than that of the SBST's Mk IIIs.<br><br>The doors are similar to that of the Lance 245, with plastic, grey handrails.<br><br>For those interested to take a Malaysian bus w/o crossing the causeway and get a complimentary 14 days temperature check, it is possible to take the bus from opposite Kranji Mrt to Woodlands Checkpoint for 80cents, and only exact change. If you dare, the fare is $1.30 from Kranji to Larkin. The reverse direction cost the same, except that it is in Ringgit is you board in Malaysia. At Woodlands Checkpoint, just cross the overhead back to the arrival hall. The berth of the Causeway link is using the existing SJE one, but there is a prominant new sign that says CSW-1 in yellow. Buses are frequent at ~10 minutes interval, 0500 - 0030, all round the year.<br><br>It is quite an interesting experience to take a Malaysian public bus in Singapore, as the monopoly held by 170 over the years is now gone. However, the routes to Queen St and Jurong East had not been scheduled to run just yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An intersting observation at Kranji today: SBST sent a lot more of Mk IIIs on 170 today, and on average, there are 3 buses waiting at the bus stop opposite Kranji MRT. These buses are only serving the shortworking sector, and when another 170 arrive from Queen St, that makes 4 at the berth. This is a  far far cary from the times when passengers had to wait 10 minutes for 1 bus, and there were very few people waiting at Kranji today, in fact, nobody was queing, save for a service captain in his lime green uniform, which is no doubt, due to SARS.<br><br>On the other end, at the escalator landing, was the service captain of Causeway Link. It is co-incidence that his uniform looks very similar to the old blue SBS uniform, complete with epaulets. He was there pulling passengers and explaining the fare to the passengers, 80cents to the Caustoms, $1.30 to Larkin, and wasn't very successful as many did not want, or perhaps dare to try the new  service and was loyal to 170. On the other hand, the service captain of SBST was sitting there passively, and chatting with the bus captains.<br><br>MAybe the competition for pax would increase tenfold once SARS blow over and SBST start to lose passengers, in fact, most of the buses today were running on empty when they left Kranji, interestingly, right after a Causeway Link bus departed the bus stop.</div>

I also do not have to prepare change if I take 170, as there is something called the ez-link card.<br><br>However, CW-1 is faster as it turns directly onto CAuseway Dr. from woodlands Rd., unlike 170 that has to make one big round in Woodlands Ctrl before going into Woodlands Custom.

I'd take Causeway Link for the novelty but that's about the most I would do.<br><br>Also, the reason why the MAN has an O405 dash is because MAN and Mercedes-Benz share components. The interior looks rather cheery and bright, compared to SBST(too much purple), however I do find the seats comfortable(after all you likened it to the Volgren O405 seats).</div>
