              <p>Let me explain this.......</p>
              <p>Basicly, 291 buses go in the following way:</p>
              <p>Park - West - East - West - East (T) - Park. <br>(Average 2hr Per 'trip', 30min per loop)</p>
              <p><br>The reason why the waiting time at East Loop is horrible is that the buses going to East Loop all depends on the buses at the West Loop. So, when the buses kena a lot of people from the West Loop, they will be late and thus bunch up with another bus; Hence the bus bunch.</p>
              <p>As this bus parade of late buses go to East Loop, they will kena alot of people from the East Loop as the front buses are late. So in the East Loop, they will bunch together. As some of the buses are in their 1 round, they would not have the 'T' sign and thus go over to the West Loop.</p>
              <p>With the East Loop - West Loop (Crossover) buses already late, they will tend to clash with buses coming out of parking. Hence, continuing the cycle.</p>
              <p><br>Possible Soloutions:</p>
              <p>- Deploy DDs. <br>However, they do take up more time as they need more time to unload people from upper deck. This is the main reason given by 291 BCs (Back in 2006 when there was DDs on 291) why they dont want DDs on 291.<br>If there were DDs, 1 loop could need 35 - 45 mins. And this will extend running time for BCs which is somehow equal to Svc 30 BCs.</p>
              <p>- More buses<br>When there are more buses, they will bunch more and this adds fuel to fire.</p>
              <p>- Shortworking Trips<br>To me, this is the best solution. How this works is that there would be around 3 'spare' buses parking at Tampines Int. When the Q from either loop gets too long, these buses would be deployed. However, they will have the 'T' sign. Hence going back to 'spare mode' after completing a loop.</p>
              <p><br>- Splitting services<br>SBST can just spilt TownLink 291 into two. Mainly feeder 291 and 294. This would ensure no bunching and accurate intervals at the interchange but cause alot of trouble for people from a loop going to the other loop.</p>

              occurs for about max 2 hrs. Not feasible to pay 3 BCs full 8hrs salary
              and keep 3 buses out of revenue service for this 2hrs in the evening.
              Furthermore this will aggrevate the parking problem faced in TMI.</p>

              <p>293's problem is not as serious as this as the east loop has services that duplicates it (28, 29) (That's why everyday you see commuters milling outside 7-11 and not entering any queue)</p>

              <p><br>Reply to the statement in <strong>BOLD:<br></strong>Hopefully throughfare will be implemented, this problem can be eliminated. That's of course by splitting. I agree that direct links will be cut but the good part will be service reliability increased and its frequency stablised. The aim of throughfare is actually to cut duplicates where necessary and to encourage people to transfer. However, this is a balance that LTA needs to work out.</p>
