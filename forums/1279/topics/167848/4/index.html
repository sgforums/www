Cant u see who is the one here that needs some "special" treatment. Seriously, If u can see also, he goes flaming all other ppl, calling them ugly or watsoever. I really dun see a point for him to beat around the bush. he shud just refer to threadstarter and just tell that he has made a pointless thread.

Cant u see who is the one here that needs some "special" treatment. Seriously, If u can see also, he goes flaming all other ppl, calling them ugly or watsoever. I really dun see a point for him to beat around the bush. he shud just refer to threadstarter and just tell that he has made a pointless thread. My point here is that some justice shud be observed at lest.<br><br>Btw im sorry but i just can help to see other forumnites get flamed.</div></blockquote></div>

You should know your own character, go and count how many people you've offended. And stop pointing finger at people when they've done nothing wrong. Go reflect on yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I don't understand but SBS2811P just really look like a little kid who has NOT be tamed after all! The way you carry out yourself in here is just like some Primary 1 kid who is still drinking milk from a milk bottle!<br><br>Another thing... I wonder why you would want to use SBS2811P as your nickname, which does NOT suit your personality at all! Perhaps little_kid would be a better nick.<br><br>PS: I am NOT trying to flame you, but it is a TRUTH based on what I observed in this forum. This is simply irksome and I still don't see you being mature over certain issues. PERIOD!</div>
