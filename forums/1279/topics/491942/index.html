              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The increment will take effect starting May and will benefit more than 700 employees, including bus captains, the transport operator says.<br><br></span></strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: UK-based transport operator and Singapore's third public bus operator Tower Transit on Monday (May 16) announced it will be bumping up the pay of its bus captains and all staff covered under its agreement with the National Transport Workers' Union by 3.5 per cent. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The increment will take effect starting May and will benefit 913 employees, including bus captains on the 26 services being taken over by the company from May 29, it said in its press release. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A junior bus captain at Tower Transit will now receive a basic monthly salary of S$1,930. With overtime and incentives, this will translate to about S$3,440 and above per month, Tower Transit said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The increment is based on national wage data and will mean that Tower Transit’s staff wages keep pace with the cost of living in Singapore, it added.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“By pegging our annual wage adjustments to national wage data, and keeping it separate from performance incentives, we’re making sure all of our staff’s wages keep in step with the cost of living in Singapore," said Tower Transit managing director Andrew Bujtor.</p>

              <p>The starting salary of S$1,930 is the same as the median starting salary for ITE Higher Nitec graduates from Electronics courses.</p>
                          
                          <p>Some say that Tower Transit is able to raise the salary because unlike SMRT and SBS Transit, it does not have shareholders to pay. If so, Go Ahead should also be able to increase its starting salary to around S$1,930.</p>
                          
                          <p>I am happy to know that Tower Transit is setting the standards of starting salary.</p>
                          
                          <p>Currently, the starting salary of S$1,625 at SMRT matches the median starting salary of ITE nitec graduates (post-NS) from nursing courses. Meanwhile, the starting salary of S$1,775 at SBS Transit is slightly higher than the median starting salary of ITE nitec graduates (post-NS) from automotive technology courses (S$1,740).</p>
                          
                          <p>I hope that SMRT can increase its starting salary of S$1,625 to at least around S$1,700, to make it comparable to similar jobs in the engineering industry. By paying a starting salary similar to those in the nursing industry, I feel that SMRT has short-changed its bus drivers.</p>
                      <p>As for SBS Transit, I can see that they are making adjustments to stay in the competition. Recently, they announced that they will use technology on their buses. I think they will increase their starting salary soon, although their starting salary is already comparable to similar jobs in the engineering industry.</p>

              <p>This one I agreed with you,Bus captain responsibilities is greater that many people don't know.Should have start with $1850-2300 depending on what classes license they possess.Should have 2 schemes of basic pay also example those with 2 days rotating weekly off start from $1700-1850 and those one day off weekly start from $2050-2400.This schemes will attract more Singaporeans to work.</p>

              <p>If the incumbent operators do not increase their starting salaries, they will continue to suffer very high levels of staff attrition.</p>

              <p>If they cannot win parcel tenders by 2022, they will have to exit the bus business altogether.</p>
              <p>What we are seeing is wage levels going up to the level of market forces, after being kept low artificially for many years.

              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, I think fares are collected and kept by govt. So they will still control fares after all. However, other sorts of tax support to residents may be reduced to compensate back. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>But it will greatly reduced. No more asking drivers to run that extra trip, collect OT while standing in traffic (due to BSRF), or to come out of off-days to drive. No more hitting the monthly limit.</p>
              <p>Besides, there are standbys as claimed. In the worst case scenario for Perth, managers would rather come out to drive the buses themselves and for good reason.</p>

              <p>To be honest, when I first saw this, I feel that Tower Transit may spoil market by setting the starting salary at S$1,930.</p>
                  <p>But when I look at the median starting salaries earn by ITE and Poly graduates, I realise +/- S$2,000 is normal for ITE graduates in the engineering field.</p>
                  <p>No offence, but now that I look at the pay, I am a bit turned off. When (If) I graduate from Polytechnic, I am expecting around S$3,000 a month, not S$1,930 or S$1,775, or even S$1,625.</p>
                  <p>By the way, how is the starting salary like for poly engineering graduates who join as technician? If the pay and job prospect is good, maybe I still can consider.</p>
