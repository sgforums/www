LTA tries not to acquire land from private land owners unless it is a must..<br><br>.</div></blockquote>I do agree that MRT station are usually built right under a road, however the orientation of Holland station for CCL puzzle me. The station was designed / orientated diagonally across a busy Holland Ave/Holland Road junction. It was neither aligned along Holland Road nor Holland Ave.<br><br>If station alignment depicts tunnel/track alignment, the track seems very likely to go under those Holland V shophouses!!!<br><br>How would you think the MRT track would go from Farrer to Holland to Buona Vista? Along Farrer Road, Holland Road, North Buona Vista Road? or Along Farrer Road, Holland Road and cut through Holland Drive estate?<br><br>Despite much vacant land in nearby Holland V, LTA chose to have it at Holland Ave/Holland Road junction, I interpreted its intention to serve as many commuters. Otherwise the station can always be built along Holland Ave or Holland Road.<br><br>As for Buona Vista station, why wouldn't it be built next to the vacant land near current BV station? Rather LTA had chosen to build at the road divider.</div>

Along Farrer Road, Holland Road, North Buona Vista Road? or Along Farrer Road, Holland Road and cut through Holland Drive estate?<br></blockquote>it is expected that the tunnels will go through Holland Drive Estate direct from Holland station to Buona Vista station.. if u use a ruler and see on a SLA street directory, the tunnels can travel straight out of Holland Village station to reach the junction of North Buona Vista Rd and Commonwealth Ave before turning a little to align with Buona Vista station's orientation.. MRT tunnels can travel straight through the area is because, one, the whole area is state land and the govt have control of what can be built there, two, they know exactly how the foundations of the HDB buildings are and so are able to dig correctly if correct engineering principles are applied, and three, the first blocks of HDB apartments it meets actually resides on a hill which gives the tunnel a safe distance to descend downwards towards Buona Vista station..<br><br>as for Farrer to Holland section, it is expected to cut through from Holland station in the exact orientation until Leedon Rd and align itself somewhat along Leedon Rd before turning under Farrer Court apartments to reach Farrer station.. Farrer station's location is chosen at the lowpoint of its surroundings so its tunnels are as deep as possible to cut through Farrer Court and the private estates in the stretch of land between Holland Rd and Leedon Rd.<br><br><blockquote><br>As for Buona Vista station, why wouldn't it be built next to the vacant land near current BV station? Rather LTA had chosen to build at the road divider.<br></blockquote>Building stations on road dividers is, as i said, developmental control in that underground stations will not be subjected to factors that may disrupt its operations and to save land space.. it is not rare at all in Singapore.. the following stations are built deep and right under the road divider: Bugis, Lavender, Newton, Braddell, HarbourFront, Outram Park, Chinatown, Little India, Farrer Park, Boon Keng, Potong Pasir, Woodleigh, Serangoon, Kovan, Buangkok, Museum, Convention Centre, Millenia, Nicoll Highway, Old Airport Rd, Tanjong Katong, Paya Lebar CCL, MacPherson, Upp Paya Lebar, Bartley, Lor Chuan, Marymount.. the land around Buona Vista is too precious to the govt as it will be used for One North hub.. similar to Paya Lebar, where LTA had to divert traffic and mess up the whole place jus so that they could dig the station box right under Paya Lebar Rd so the land north of Paya Lebar can be redeveloped instead of putting a station there.. and stations that are not under the road divider do not have any built-up areas above them, like Tanjong Pagar (green space), Raffles Place (green space), Dhoby Ghaut (green space), Somerset (Stamford Canal), Orchard (green space).. only Tiong Bahru and Novena (shallowest depth of 11m) have redevelopments coming up right above the station box after the station was built and commissioned..</div>

It just happen that Holland Ave was served by 3 TIBS and 1 SBST services. And I took TIBS services most of the time.<br><br>Regarding my wait for TIBS 106 for a full 35 minutes, it will happen to SBST services as well, as all buses are caught in a massive jam in Orchard Road. Hence my concerns are not directed only on TIBS but to LTA and SBST as well. What actions/measures they have if their buses are caught in a jam?<br><br>Since the route was amended to Suntec for TIBS 106, I had observed a dramatically increase in waiting time for TIBS 106. Of course I had sympathy with TIBS, I took TIBS 106 on a Saturday morning from Capitol to Holland V, the dual carriage bendy bus at any one time have less than 10 commuters, the bus did not pick many passsenger in Orchard. As a public-listed bus company, shouldn't the company explore routes beyond Suntec? Perhaps to Marine Parade....Imagine duplicate most part of its route with TIBS 77 and SBST111.<br><br>I had spent 3 months in Austin, Texas. Though they have few bus routes and the frequency was pretty low, 30 to 45 minutes for each services. I am very satisfied and happy with their services. With a USD15 monthly pass, I had unlimited travels on these buses. All bus stops will indicate the arrival time of all calling bus. And they are very punctual! I need to be at the busstop 2 minutes before the scheduled arrival time. Furthermore, when the buses was packed, the driver will walkie-talkie to their bus companies, and the bus companies will quickly despatch another bus to serve commuters at the downstream...<br><br>Unlike in Singapore, when a bus was packed, or when 2 bus buses running on same routes meet at a bus stop, both buses seems to stick together, shouldn't one of the buses speed up and skip stops when no  commuters alighting? The bus captain should know that commuters at the downstreams probably have waited a long, long time..The bus companies must really come out with a system to resolve those long waiting time.<br><br></div>

And BTW, 106 loops at Suntec, not terminating at Marina Center. It's due to the jams on Orchard Rd and Somerset Rd, such that Bukit Batok cannot dispatch buses since the buses haven't arrived yet!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a question that will be brought up sonner or later: If the line is called the <strong>Circle</strong> Line, then why does it terminate at HarbourFront? A ST article years ago once showed that the Circle Line would most probably make its way back to Phase 1. This will be excellent as the line would then have to pass the new yet-to-be-built Downtown @ Marina and this will bode well as they will be able to 'intergrate' the city with its transport system. The following would be the possible 'Phase 6' of the CCL<br><br><strong>Circle Line Phase 6</strong><br>Shenton Way - the line travels along Keppel Rd and the station would possibly be at the Keppel/Anson Rd junc.<br>Marina Bay - Links with the NSL, this station has been dead for years since its completion while it gets ready to be possibly one of the busiest in the future when Downtown @ Marina is completed.<br>Marina Park - possibly built on the northwest corner of the present Marina City Park.<br>Millenium - the line goes back to Suntec City, where the <span style="font-style: italic;">Circle</span> is now finally complete<br><br>I would also like to suggest the possible route for the BTL and ERL:<br><br><strong>Bukit Timah Line</strong><br><br>Nicoll Highway - Links with CCL, built to the right of it, parallel to the CCL.<br>Lavender - Links with EWL, the line runs along Nicoll Highway, followed by Crawford St<br>Farrer Park - Links with NEL, the large number of exits lead me to determine that this could be a possible interchange station. I believe there is ample space.<br>Newton - Links with NSL, possibly built opposite it at the Scotts Rd and Newton Circus.<br>Whitley - not entirely possible due to space constraints. Although I believe there will be no station in this area, but this station has to be somwhere around here to accomodate for the ERL. (explained later)<br>Adam - Links with CCL, possibly built in the same spot, or between the Dunearn and Bt Timah Roads.<br>Old Turf Club - a minor detour in is possible, possibly at Turf Club Rd/Swiss Club Lk junc.<br>Bukit Timah - possibly built between KTM rail line and Jln Anak Bukit or further on, nearer to Ewart Circus.<br>Hillview/Dairy Farm - possibly built between Jln Asas and Chestnut Drive along Upp Bt Timah Rd.<br><br>From here, I was not sure if the line should terminate at CCK or continue on. I decided that the BTL should stop at CCK as letting it run to Kranji/Woodlands will simply parallel the NSL, which would be a complete waste. Therefore, the final station is<br><br>Choa Chu Kang - possibly built under it, somewhat similar to Sengkang.<br><br>The line is long but there are not many stations, given the fact that the line is passing through an area where there is not much need for public transport, except for educational institutes, much to the fact pointing to the large number of residents being able to afford a car or two. The line, I believe is to provide a quicker link to complement the west branch of the EWL and provide faster access to the northwest.<br><br>However, I quite doubt my predictions as the whole line will be practically running under a canal.<br><br><strong>Eastern Region Line</strong><br><br>MacPherson - Links with the CCL, the area is a bit cramped but a speech transcript says that MacPherson will be a interchange with the ERL. I doubt it a bit but the position isn't so bad.<br>Ubi/Kaki Bukit - a station servicing the two industrial estates is possible but there is almost a lack of space unless they are to pull down some blocks.<br>Bedok Reservoir - at the fringe of it, maybe at the corner of Bedok Resv./Bedok Nth Rd.<br>Bedok North - maybe built between Temasek Poly and ITE Tampines.<br>Simei - Links with the EWL. It could be built ala Sengkang station and both lines at this point will be parallel to each other.<br><br>From here onwards the line travels down towards East Coast and to the proposed Long Island development. There could be around 5 to 6 stations.<br><br>Marina East - At the Fort Rd/ECP junc.<br>Tanjong Rhu - this station could be built anywhere along Tanjong Rhu Rd, possibly near the bridge which connects Tanjong Rhu to the Indoor Stadium.<br>Marina Park - Links with the CCL, this station will be the interchange which connects the southern part of the system with the new line. There will be almost no way to connect this line to Raffles Place, City Hall or Chinatown.<br>Kim Seng - the line passes under Marina Bay, under Merchant and Havelock Rds to Kim Seng Rd/Prom at Great World City.<br>Tanglin? - a station has to be built somewhere around here. Not only does it free up the Orchard station jam but it is also a halfway point between Kim Seng and the next station.<br>Whitley - Links to the BTL, this area is already very cramped so I'm not too sure.<br>Novena - Links to the NSL, the tunnels would have to make an extremely tight turn here. This might be possible.<br>Boon Keng -  Links with the NEL, this is the only link to the NEL but there might be no space to accomodate another station here.<br>Kallang Way - there is space here to build a station to the left of Circuit Rd Estate, but it may be fighting for space with the KPE.<br>MacPherson - returns to the station.<br></div>
