Neglecting waiting time before boarding, but including waiting time for transfer at either RFP or NEL, the travel times are as follows:<br><br>NSL-EWL: 11-17 mins<br>NSL-NEL: 11-17.5 mins<br>ORC-OTP (with 2 stops in between): 7 mins<br>BUS: 13 mins<br><br>Saving just a maximum of 10 minutes at (my) estimated cost of $1-1.2bn (for fully underground) is not worth it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone. I see that there are three types of trains currently in service with SMRT- the older trains, slighly newer trains with greener windows( a e-orh, e-orh sound can be heard when stopping) and the newest trains with the upper portion painted in black. Which is the siemens model and kawasaki model?<br>Are they still getting the newest trains after the gear box problem about two years ago?</div>
