            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>If 28 is to be amended and Svc 93 were to be withdrawn, Bartley road will have no bus services going towards Braddell Rd!<br><br>28 may be kept or amended and Svc 93 may be kept as it acts as the backbone of CCL.<br><br>My speculation: Between 8-13 services will be affected - be it amendment or withdrawal. It will be comparable to NEL Rationalisation. It could be more because CCL is a long train route. It could be less as not many services duplicate CCL for more than 3/4 Stations (except 93)<br></blockquote>The actual load between Braddell Rd, Bartley Rd and Paya Lebar is not high. Most of the load comes from Maris Stella High School and soon-defunct Outram Institute only, which will be replaced by Bartley Station. And Braddell Rd is not very developed to sustain a high load, and services currently plying the area merely do so as it is the shortest route to get from Braddell Rd to Paya Lebar Rd. If you are the unlucky few who wants to get from Braddell Rd to Bartley Rd and Paya Lebar, then take SBST 153 to Serangoon Station and change to CCL.<br><br>As for SBST 93 forming the backbone of CCL, it is unlikely it will be kept as so or else it will result in duplication and an 'empty' backbone. Like what they do now when the MRT breaks down, TIBS buses will ply the full route for free, so you don't need a sort of "backup" system. Unless SBST is interested in letting Svc 93 compete with SMRT/TIBS' CCL, then they might wan to extend to Holland Village, and have more air-con buses in its fleet.<br><br>You are true in saying it does not duplicate too many current services. Who would actually go to Bukit Brown, as far as we can see now in our near future? And I expect it to stop near centres of activity like Queensway and Bt Merah but it chose to go to areas like Pasir Panjang and West Coast so it's kind of stupid. Unless the government has plans for the area that are unannounced or unheard of, else I think Stage 5 is kind of lame.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i was thinking it will link Queen St to Kranji, which will be linked to the future Singapore-Malaysia railway line, if it comes true.. and after all there's not so much space constraint and affected traffic if an interchange station is built at Kranji..<br><br>regarding ERL haven't thought about it.. heh..</div>

LTA tries not to acquire land from private land owners unless it is a must.. as for SCGS, it is safe to do so as it is state land but again we have to consider if the construction is bad for the school.. the front driveway and the field is likely to go, together with probably the primary school section..<br><br>as for The Equatorial, not exactly that case since Bukit Timah Line won't come to you in the near enough future.. so we can't ask them not to proceed with their construction and wait for LTA to build together the whole area.. however, Whitley is a bad place to put a MRT station though not impossible (see Chinatown MRT)..<br><br>and yes, exits will be at two sides of Bt Timah Rd through underpasses, but stations under waterbodies are a bad idea as it is usually reduces its useful life span.. even Clarke Quay had to be built on the river bank but not under the Singapore River itself else it could last 20-30 years shorter than other stations on NEL..<br><br>it is also likely that the current vehicular bridges across Whitley Rd will be reconstructed together with Whitley station, in the process decreasing the width of Bt Timah Canal temporarily.. so the whole area's traffic system is redeveloped..</div>
