            <div class='col-md body'>i realised that the distance between the station till the end point is actually quite short.. If the viaduct is to go downslope right after Jurong West St 64 and reach underground before the carpark, it has to go very steeply down which i don't think will happen... I think that the MSCarpark may really has to disappear somewhere else before the gradual downslope can be formed....<br><br>If they don't want to make this underground pathway, the space above ground they have is looks like quite cramped and maybe some things have to be removed to make way for the viaduct line.......<br><br>Perhaps they can rebuilt part of the viaduct after the boon lay station to turn gradually rightward so as to go past the carpark if they really need it there...but beyond that, if they don't go underground for a while, i don't know how it will be able to squeeze in the viaduct in that area. maybe they can built it on top of the Jurong West St 63 Road but that road is not wide enough, unless they widens it...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jurong West St 63 area seems almost impossible for a MRT viaduct or tunnel. The road only has 2 lanes in each direction, the central divider is narrow, and the open spaces beside the road is not big either.</div>
