There will be almost no way to connect this line to Raffles Place, City Hall or Chinatown.<br>Kim Seng - the line passes under Marina Bay, under Merchant and Havelock Rds to Kim Seng Rd/Prom at Great World City.<br><br>Whitley - Links to the BTL, this area is already very cramped so I'm not too sure.<br>Novena - Links to the NSL, the tunnels would have to make an extremely tight turn here. This might be possible.<br><br></div></blockquote>actually it could interchange with both NSL and CCL at Marina Bay for greater connectivity so the cost of building it is viable.. then it don't have to ply a long stretch across the city via Havelock and Merchant Rds and go deep under the CTE tunnels, which are heavy duty tunnels unlike MRT tunnels.. so from Marina Bay, it could then turn into Cantonment Rd and interchange with Outram Park, with the station built under Outram Rd alongside EWL tracks.. construction is possible, however, only when the SGH delivery base buildings are condemned within 10 years' time.. then it could go straight to Kim Seng station..<br><br>the interchange don't really have to be at Whitley.. Adam station area has a lot of space to accomodate and it won't be so steep.. then from Tanglin station the tunnel can go under Botanic Gardens with good developmental control.. and anyway Novena station area is quite cramped so it may well be built under the junction of Newton/Moulmein/Thomson Rds or at the big island in front of Revenue House..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite interesting read on the guesses on the location of the mrt stations provided by fellow members.<br><br>I have also made some guesses. b4 presenting my version, would like to reply to the topic regarding the position of Holland station.<br><br>If the station is located at the suggested location, ie @ blk 12, it will be too near Buona Vista station and a big portion of their catchment area will overlap.  More importantly, the current location will act as an interchange when a future line the runs through Holland Road is constructed.<br><br>Here's my version<br>1. <span style="font-style: italic;">CCL Phase 6</span><br>Yes. it should be a closed loop.  In fact the line is planned as a 35 station 40km line, of which 29 stations, 33.3km has been announced.  5 of the 6 remaining stations have been revealed in the new downtown plan.  They r <strong>Tanjong Pagar</strong>, East Lagoon, <strong>Marina Bay</strong>, <strong>Bayfront</strong> and <strong>Sheares</strong> (these 2 stations r near both ends of Marina City Park)  and will be linked up @ Millenia station.  The last station should be @ KTM Railway station.  Unlikely to be built until Marina South is very developed?<br><br>2. <span style="font-style: italic;">BTL</span><br>According to the concept plan, the line will be extended to the missing station on NSL, ie NS6 @ Sungei Kadut.  then it will be further extended north towards the causeway, make a u turn back to Woodlands b4 linking up with yet to be revealed Thomson Line.<br><br>The known info of this line is it serves Bukit Panjang, Upper Bukit Timah and Bukit Timah so I shall terminate @ Bukit Panjang<br><strong>Bukit Panjang</strong><br>Hillview<br>Old Jurong Road<br>Toh Yi<br>Maplewoods<br>Sixth Ave<br>The Chinese High School (or whatever name it will be next year)<br><strong>Adam</strong><br>Whitley<br>Swiss Cottage<br><strong>Newton</strong><br>Kampong Java<br><strong>Little India</strong><br><strong>Bugis</strong><br><strong>Millenia</strong><br>I believe the extension will not be constructed in the near future.<br><br>3. <span style="font-style: italic;">ERL</span><br>According to LTA, this line is supposed to be intra and intertown links for eastern regions, namely Tampines, Kaki Bukit, MacPherson, Marine Parade. but according to the concept plan, it looks more like 2 EWLs (1 in the north while the other in the south) running // to the current 1.<br>The other known info is MacPherson will be an interchange.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Southern Route</span><br>If u recall, when Marina Line was 1st announced, it has another leg that comes from Chinatown station.

The govt has announced that ERL and BTL will not be built for the next 10 years. So only the CCL will be built</div>
