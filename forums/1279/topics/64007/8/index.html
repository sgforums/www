Neglecting waiting time before boarding, but including waiting time for transfer at either RFP or NEL, the travel times are as follows:<br><br>NSL-EWL: 11-17 mins<br>NSL-NEL: 11-17.5 mins<br>ORC-OTP (with 2 stops in between): 7 mins<br>BUS: 13 mins<br><br>Saving just a maximum of 10 minutes at (my) estimated cost of $1-1.2bn (for fully underground) is not worth it.

It will be like a steep descending tunnel bending sharp to the right. LTA also will avoid building MRT tunnels under roads as that will mean necessary road diversion and may result in traffic congestion.</div></blockquote>LTA have to build tunnels under the roads as part of development control. If not, it will be difficult to allow new buildings up above the tunnels and this will lead to waste of land. the way the tunnel is built always follow the shape of a road on top, if you have noticed. construction that causes road diversions are stations that are built under a road and cut-and-cover tunnel building (which is only done when there's low traffic flow on the road). tunnel boring does not require roads to be diverted. if you are thinking why paya lebar road between UPL and BLY stations there's diversion of the whole stretch road when paya lebar rd is not a low traffic flow road, it's because of the building of crossovers to Kim Chuan CCL Depot, which is not simple tunnel boring.<br><br>regarding tunneling west of Boon Lay station, i have done my rough measurements and observations, using mainly the cases of Kallang-Lavender (best) and Redhill-Tiong Bahru. Kembangan-Bedok was not used as the road was elevated above the tunnel, which is unsimilar to our case here.<br><br>the distance from the nearer end of a 4.5 metres high elevated station platform to the cut-and-cover tunnel opening is about 400-450 metres, with full descending below ground level by 700 metres. the descend is about 1Â° for this stretch, which is gentler than the gradient of the underground bored tunnel to the next station. also, noise control guidelines stipulate that the distance between the viaduct and the nearest building, be it school or HDB Apt, is 20 metres. let's say we will build a tunnel right after Boon Lay station, and assuming we will close a certain section of Jurong West Street 63 for the construction of the descending tracks, in BNL's case, the descend can only begin after the viaduct had passed above Jurong West Street 64 to maintain a height restriction of 4.5 metres above this road, and the opening of the tunnel is at the junction of Jurong West Streets 63 and 65, and thus the total section of Jurong West Street 63 to be closed will have to be between Jurong West Streets 64 and 61. Jurong West Street 65 will have to be split into two different road sectors at Jurong West Street 63. Note that none of the car park entrances in the vicinity is located on Jurong West Street 63, but mainly at Jurong West Street 65.<br><br>judging from the constraints of the area west of Boon Lay station, i feel it is not feasible to build a tunnel right after Boon Lay station. if we had the viaducts built on Jurong West St 63, we need only to sacrifice 2 lanes, one from each direction. and this meets the minimum requirement of a distance of 20 metres between the viaduct and the nearest building. thus, i expect the descend and tunnelling to start from Pioneer Road North, with the tracks curving southwards while descending along the closed Jurong Rd before descending fully under Jurong Rd.</div>
