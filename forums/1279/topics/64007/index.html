The only duplicate was from Holland Village and Adam Road (Serene Center).<br><br>165 provides connection between Clementi, Holland and Macritchie, Upper Thomson Road. 165 might cut back to run between AMK interchange and Clementi.

But i expected LTA to ask them to walk to Paya Lebar or Aljunied stations, or if u can't walk take Svc 155. Or cut Svc 80 to New Bridge Rd Ter? And I do believe Eunos Int is under-utilized. ^5=)<br><br>The decision on Svc 93 was done considering its relatively low load compared to other services serving the area. It ain't completely duplicating CCL i'll think, so i didn't think about duplication too much when i decided that Svc 93 will be withdrawn. LTA had actually used the new ez-link system to collect data (boarding AND now alighting points data can be collected) to simulate what will happen if a specified group of service(s) were removed and number of passengers affected and stuff so i think the computer will probably throw Svc 93 out. haha..<br><br><blockquote><br>Sv. 28 back to the good old days isn't it?

I'm not sure if SBS Transit is too serious about providing long-distance express services unlike TIBS (they jus introduced 966). I expect LTA will ask passengers to take EWL then CCL to get from Tampines to Upp Paya Lebar Rd and Bishan.<br><br>As for Svc 62 and 70 I'm not too sure, didn't dare to think too far. but it's a gd idea and a possibility.

After all, it's load is not that fantastic (except school term peak) and could easily be diverted to SBST 74 or CCL-NSL.<br><br>As for Svc 855, at first I believe it could be withdrawn, but eventually I came to same conclusion as you. And after all, with Svc 93 and 852 removed, it is the only service left to serve Farrer-Bt Merah-HarbourFront link and YCK-Farrer link. As for PSA Building area currently served by Svc 93, well, take the CCL.<br><br>I was thinking with the relocation of St Andrew's Junior College, will the vacant area (together with the forest area further uphill near Depot Rd) be made to become another technological (and marine) hub since it will have enough land to reach critical mass and the government planning to have a station there jus made it seem like a feasible possibility the area could be redeveloped.
