              The S179 problem reminds me of how KMB in Hong Kong...
              
              In HK a lot of the peak hour special buses also has to incur dead mileages like 301, 43P...
              
              But people are still operating the buses because this arrangement is better than implementing an return leg that makes no sense to run. Quickly turnaround make another trip on another service already [for likes of 43P].
              
              As for what timetabling issues, it's all based on estimation... 
              
              End up now 179... SLBP likes to collect all the 10c, 20c than properly operating the main demand during the PM peak which cost 73c to 103c.
              
              1st time yours truly see people earn revenue by seeing the 10c, 20c business...

              Eh...
              
              There are certain timebelt 2x S179A = 1x S179 dispatch... Which is why the stipulated freq is 3 - 6 mins. 
              
              But in any case, there's still people who would take 179 from Boon Lay during AM peak... All thanks to what the timekeepers did in the past...
              
              Purposely make the 179A queue very long.. ask people to squeeze more.. then the pax who still cannot board.. make them wait another 10 mins for next bus...
              
              The squeeze until during LO3x era.. people can't even alight the bus at the first few bus stops inside NTU... Incur all the additional and waste runtime..
              
              Then 179 over-operate... You can ask around people and they'll tell you SBST operating 179A is a joke.. sometimes no bus at all one... 
              
              In the first place... SLBP people dunno how to manage high demand routes actually.. squeeze this squeeze that... lambat here, lambat there... dunno how to make the bus quickly turnaround and make sure the semi express variant is really semi express...
              
              If SLBP still want to play this.. Might as well they dun operate 179A at all.. All the PM peak 23 buses run as 179 since they like to collect all the 10c and 20c inbound DBTF... Then freq is at 2.5 mins per bus...
              
              Then see later South Spine people will complain or not... 7pm - 8pm mealbreak period S179 still cannot clear the crowd... 
              
              Then at BNL boarding bay... 243G BC will get tulan or not... 
              
              You make money is by making things efficient.. which is the schedulers job... Not going around chut pattern, delay this and that...

              There's a fine line over over-operating buses...
              
              What happens if Pioneer Stn MRT station no train ops? Then people post photo of the bus stop mess.. so many 179 over-operated?
              
              Or 179A duty bus get into RTA while running as 179... How to file report to LTA vocational department?

              S241 PM peak overoperated also... 2 mins effective freq..
              
              Buses obviously pulled over from 179A...

              SLBP's pattern dun think I dunno.... 
              
              The worst thing is S241 BC also dun observe traffic rule... At Jurong West St 91 turning to Pioneer Rd Nth still use left lane to do right turn... Nearly a daily affair...
              
              I think is scared of lambat at Pioneer Stn.. which SBST peeps at Braddell did not account for cos it's not supposed to be there...

              Seriously... Spare the agony..
              
              If SLBP thinks 179 more demand or is because NTUSU or NTU admin staff asking for more 179... Then tell Braddell ppl to plan for 100% 179 ops during PM peak... at 2.5 mins freq with the same 23 buses...
              
              No more 27231 or 27281 downroute.. since SLBP want to pao jiak all the 10c or 20c inbound fare... 10c or 20c more profitable than earning $1.03 or $0.93!
              
              Later at BNL boarding bay, after 243G complete boarding ops... 3x S179 waiting behind if 1st bus was actually lambat by 1 min... Creating blockade at Int driveway...
              
              later at 27211 also block traffic...
              
              later South Spine there crowd cannot clear.. even until 8pm cannot clear...
              
              Then increase runtime for 241 as well... by 3 mins.. because of the Pioneer Stn ops... SLBP BCs over there anyhow alight people all these while.. 4th bus also alight pax cos all dun want to wait...
              
              That's how SLBP say this kind of bus ops is the only way to be profitable... 
              
              Tell people how be content with current ops... make all the other pax suffer only...

              <p>Dude, I don't know what your issues are, but they are <strong>over-exagerrated.</strong></p>
              <p>241 peak is over-operated because there is demand. At Boon Lay itself, 241 bus gets 55-60 pax. By the time it is at Pioneer, maybe few alight but at least 50-55 pax are still on board. Can fit in people? So that people don't have to squeeze in, crossovers from 179 are there to take care of the 7PM+ peak load towards st 91.</p>
              <p>Even AM peak, 241 by the time it comes to Pioneer North road, is already packed to the door. This is with 3-5 mins frequency. If such a service is over-operated, there is a need, and I think you should be happy instead of complaining.</p>

              <p>SLBP is not stupid. If 179A is doing the job and earning more revenue, why will it under-operate 179A?</p>
              <p>It is right on their part to run more buses on s179 because most people don't want to go to Boon Lay. Most people from NTU want to alight at Pioneer. Have you not seen that? Maybe you are one of those who wants to alight at Boon Lay and hence you crib because you don't get 179A as frequently as 179.</p>
              <p>But let me tell you, SLBP is doing the right thing by scheduling more buses on 179. The time taken to just enter Boon Lay interchange at PM peak can be long because of the number of buses turning right. Can take upto 2-3 signals to just enter interchange. In that time, people who take MRT at Pioneer would have already reached Clementi.</p>
              <p>You have a hidden agenda here and that's why you are making such a big scene of it. As a commuter who has taken 179 and seen 179A, I think they are well operated and most times buses have 70-80 pax on board due to the superb frequency in PM peak.</p>

              His issues are as follows:<br>
              Extremely self centred<br>
              Ignorant of society as a whole<br>
              Extremely egoistic causing arrogrance<br>
              <br>
              Which results in him refusing to listen to others and trying to plow his way through arguments. A bigger problem when he is not entirely rational He thinks he has won an argument when people give up, but in actual fact by that stage he would had lost the whole plot. So many years and he hasn't changed at all, in fact he has been more aggressive recently. <br>

              I don't even bother to read once it says 179, which accounts for at least 80% of his recent posts.
