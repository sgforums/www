              That's LTA's cue...
              
              But in reality.. chickenlittle2's statement sounds like SLBP's staff cover up... Cos all along they didn't want to operate 179A though it was stipulated...
              
              So what they did... was come out with 2 patterns... That's why last time ever got timekeeper manipulating PM peak ops part...
              
              1) Underoperate 179A by throwing buses to 179... To feed people to Pioneer... I got a reply from LTA stating SBST feeds 1700 ppl to Pioneer during the peak hrs... eh... 5 - 7 mins, 10 trips of ADD can feed 1700 ppl to Pioneer??? power sia SLBP... 1x ADD can carry 170 passengers!
              
              2) Dun operate 179A at all.. Keep on spamming the buses to 27231... Then report that 179A no people take... Anyhow operate one!
              
              The 27231 downroute acted as a last resort because often in the past, students at South Spine had to wait until after 7pm in order to wait for a bus to get home... That's the reason why in from the beginning, 179A operated till 8pm...
              
              But this created problems for SLBP... That chickenlittle2 may him/ herself may not know...
              
              a) Because of how SLBP's manner of handling 179, often created a lot of problem whenever the spammed S179 buses return to BNL.. There's often an impulse load of 6 S179 jamming up Jurong West St 64 &amp; Jurong West Central 3's driveway... SLBP's claim of traffic jam is excuse because I've observed that if whenever 179 is properly operated, the problematic queue is less or in fact, smooth sailing during certain peak hour timebelt!
              
              b) S179 often couldn't cope... BC become dangerous/ rude drivers... There was ever once the BC just didn't bother to wait for alighting pax at 27231.. Until passengers openly scolded the BC...
              
              BC say why not alighting fast.. I myself blasted the BC... Why no 179A bus to clear the crowd... keep on throwing 179 and underoperated... SLBP asking for it... In fact that very trip was crawling... took 30 mins to get from 27211 to BNL Int...
              
              c) Pioneer - NTU shuttle bus? The bus freq is capped by LTA at 5 mins freq during the AM peak... and how many people can the buses carry?
              
              d) The problem with 179A so called less utilised is because SLBP in the past kept on feeding the trolls.. at 27211 unofficial 179 freq set by SLBP is 3 mins.. so people kept on taking 179... cos got priority in boarding...
              
              leaving 27231, 27251 with only 179A to take... leaving those people who really need 179 being unable to board the bus at all.. bus just fly stop...
              
              e) There was an instance the Pioneer Rd Nth and Jurong West St 63/ Pioneer Stn was congested with the factory buses... But SLBP OCC didn't declare anything... and only 179 was able to be dispatched at 6 mins per bus.. Even S241 also lambat...
              
              But what to do? S179 managed to pull out ghost buses to maintain headways... Is this fair to S241 commuters or not?
              
              So.. SLBP kept on manipulating the bus schedules... Until the whole place's demand mgmt and other bus svs's ops end up so messy...

              chickenlittle2 obviously listen too much to SLBP... People never operate the buses are per stipulated also come with 1 list of excuses... Ask them go work in Braddell as Sv Devt them... so clever to ownself plan the bus schedule...
              
              Until also dunno Braddell HQ stipulated S179 freq for PM peak dun tally w/ SLBP's... 
              
              SLBP dun operate the buses properly all those are excuses.. They created the mess themselves...
              
              Even there was once a TI from Braddell go check on S179's dispatch at 27251 months ago... He kept on shaking head how come he only see S179... no 179A...
              
              SLBP... really atas... ownself is boss though 179A's cue is set by LTA.. the govt...
              
              But seriously... S179 problem reminds me of the past... Everything timekeeper... That's why 179 always buses clusterfark then the next group of bus's headways is 10 mins or beyond...
              
              oh yah... SLBP really clever... 179A dun operate.. Govt fund for bus svs to be operated and improved under BSEP.. and SLBP say suka suka 179A dun operate... power sia...

              They should just take ISB D, whinging about buses which could help the general public instead of students of one particular institution where concession passes could be used and a parallel free shuttle is available shows how pampered some are, it is only fair for the school to pay for more buses to serve the ISB instead of leeching on resources which could help the public.

              <p>As a frequent 179A passenger, I have to say that I prefer taking 179A to school then taking the NTU shuttle even though my classes are in the south spine, meaning I will need to take a big round. The NTU shuttle can take ages to come and the freq can be real bad..the queue is super crazy also..have to wait 2 or even 3 buses before one can board, especially between 8am to 9am. However, no matter how many people queue for 179/179A, I will be able to board the first bus and most of the time I even get a seat. 179A is definitely more reliable than the NTU shuttle.</p>
              <p>I have to agree that during PM peak, 179 may be hard to catch (esp if I am waiting at 27251) and I personally encountered that before. Waited for very long before 3 or even 4 buses come together. Most of the time the buses are already filled at the north spine stop (27211) and therefore it is real hard to board 179. I ever saw 2 buses (179) stopping at 27211 to pick up pax at the same time..the first one left with full pax and the 2nd was waiting at the bus stop to pick up more pax..and I thought the 2nd bus can actually go and pick up pax at the next few bus stops so that others at the next few bus stops can actually board the bus.</p>
              <p>Last of all, from what I observe, about 60-70% of the 179A pax in the morning do not buy concession...</p>

              <p>Hahahaha. Same thoughts exactly. Why would I spend time queuing at Boon Lay and let the bus go through 4 traffic lights and 1 pedestrian crossing when I could just spend 2 extra minute on the train to Pioneer.</p>
              <p>Although, before sbst improved 179 in 2011/12, this will deprive the commuters along pioneer north road to board. But now, buses are never consecutively full to the door in the morning so I guess its fine.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Agree. But the crowd at Pioneer MRT stop in the morning peak is very uncertain. Got a few times I waited and can only barely board the 2nd 179 at Pioneer stop at 8.15am. While waiting, at least 4 179As go past. So from then i go Boon Lay take 179A confirm can board unless its past morning peak or in the afternoon..but then now at times I will see downroutes from Pionner MRT in the morning so i guess that will clear the Pioneer MRT crowd...</p></div>

              <p>That’s <span>LTA</span>’s cue…</p>
              <p>But in reality.. chickenlittle2’s statement sounds like
                                                      <span>SLBP</span>’s staff cover up… Cos all along they
                                                      didn’t want to operate 179A though it was stipulated…</p>
              <p>So what they did… was come out with 2 patterns… That’s why last
                                                      time ever got timekeeper manipulating PM peak ops part…</p>
              <p>1) Underoperate 179A by throwing buses to 179… To feed people to
                                                      Pioneer… I got a reply from <span>LTA</span> stating
                                                      <span>SBST</span> feeds 1700 ppl to Pioneer during the
                                                      peak hrs… eh… 5 – 7 mins, 10 trips of <span>ADD</span> can
                                                      feed 1700 ppl to Pioneer??? power sia <span>SLBP</span>…
                                                      1x <span>ADD</span> can carry 170 passengers!</p>
              <p>2) Dun operate 179A at all.. Keep on spamming the buses to
                                                      27231… Then report that 179A no people take… Anyhow operate
                                                      one!</p>
              <p>The 27231 downroute acted as a last resort because often in the
                                                      past, students at South Spine had to wait until after 7pm in order
                                                      to wait for a bus to get home… That’s the reason why in from the
                                                      beginning, 179A operated till 8pm…</p>
              <p>But this created problems for <span>SLBP</span>… That
                                                      chickenlittle2 may him/ herself may not know…</p>
              <p>a) Because of how <span>SLBP</span>’s manner of
                                                      handling 179, often created a lot of problem whenever the spammed
                                                      <span>S179</span> buses return to <span>BNL</span>.. There’s often an impulse load of 6 <span>S179</span> jamming up Jurong West St 64 &amp; Jurong West
                                                      Central 3’s driveway… <span>SLBP</span>’s claim of traffic
                                                      jam is excuse because I’ve observed that if whenever 179 is
                                                      properly operated, the problematic queue is less or in fact, smooth
                                                      sailing during certain peak hour timebelt!</p>
              <p>b) <span>S179</span> often couldn’t cope… BC become
                                                      dangerous/ rude drivers… There was ever once the BC just didn’t
                                                      bother to wait for alighting pax at 27231.. Until passengers openly
                                                      scolded the BC…</p>
              <p>BC say why not alighting fast.. I myself blasted the BC… Why no
                                                      179A bus to clear the crowd… keep on throwing 179 and
                                                      underoperated… <span>SLBP</span> asking for it… In fact
                                                      that very trip was crawling… took 30 mins to get from 27211 to
                                                      <span>BNL</span> Int…</p>
              <p>c) Pioneer – <span>NTU</span> shuttle bus? The bus freq
                                                      is capped by <span>LTA</span> at 5 mins freq during the AM
                                                      peak… and how many people can the buses carry?</p>
              <p>d) The problem with 179A so called less utilised is because
                                                      <span>SLBP</span> in the past kept on feeding the trolls..
                                                      at 27211 unofficial 179 freq set by <span>SLBP</span> is 3
                                                      mins.. so people kept on taking 179… cos got priority in
                                                      boarding…</p>
              <p>leaving 27231, 27251 with only 179A to take… leaving those
                                                      people who really need 179 being unable to board the bus at all..
                                                      bus just fly stop…</p>
              <p>e) There was an instance the Pioneer Rd Nth and Jurong West St
                                                      63/ Pioneer Stn was congested with the factory buses… But
                                                      <span>SLBP OCC</span> didn’t declare anything… and only
                                                      179 was able to be dispatched at 6 mins per bus.. Even <span>S241</span> also lambat…</p>
              <p>But what to do? <span>S179</span> managed to pull out
                                                      ghost buses to maintain headways… Is this fair to <span>S241</span> commuters or not?</p>
              <p>So.. <span>SLBP</span> kept on manipulating the bus
                                                      schedules… Until the whole place’s demand mgmt and other bus svs’s
                                                      ops end up so messy…</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">What you said about SLBP are serious allegations and you must be prepared to use hard evidence to back them up. For a start, you should be taking down timings and regos.</span></p>
              <p>And I am surprised <span style="line-height: 1.231;">you still did not manage to figure out the real cause of the issue that led to your alleged observations.</span></p>
              <p>It should be an easy fix by LTA. Go talk to them again. This is the only clue I can give. I am sorry but I am not allowed to comment further or point out what this issue is for legal reasons. You will have to figure it out yourself.</p>

              <p>Agree. But the crowd at Pioneer MRT stop in the morning peak is very uncertain. Got a few times I waited and can only barely board the 2nd 179 at Pioneer stop at 8.15am. While waiting, at least 4 179As go past. So from then i go Boon Lay take 179A confirm can board unless its past morning peak or in the afternoon..but then now at times I will see downroutes from Pionner MRT in the morning so i guess that will clear the Pioneer MRT crowd...</p>

              <p>Yes, the only advantage of Boon Lay is that you also get 179A from there. But I have never faced a problem even boarding the first 179 bus at Pioneer. I don't get a seat many times but equally many times I also get a seat.</p>
