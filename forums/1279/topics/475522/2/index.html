              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>That’s <span>LTA</span>’s cue…</p>
              <p>But in reality.. chickenlittle2’s statement sounds like
              <span>SLBP</span>’s staff cover up… Cos all along they
              didn’t want to operate 179A though it was stipulated…</p>
              <p>So what they did… was come out with 2 patterns… That’s why last
              time ever got timekeeper manipulating PM peak ops part…</p>
              <p>1) Underoperate 179A by throwing buses to 179… To feed people to
              Pioneer… I got a reply from <span>LTA</span> stating
              <span>SBST</span> feeds 1700 ppl to Pioneer during the
              peak hrs… eh… 5 – 7 mins, 10 trips of <span>ADD</span> can
              feed 1700 ppl to Pioneer??? power sia <span>SLBP</span>…
              1x <span>ADD</span> can carry 170 passengers!</p>
              <p>2) Dun operate 179A at all.. Keep on spamming the buses to
              27231… Then report that 179A no people take… Anyhow operate
              one!</p>
              <p>The 27231 downroute acted as a last resort because often in the
              past, students at South Spine had to wait until after 7pm in order
              to wait for a bus to get home… That’s the reason why in from the
              beginning, 179A operated till 8pm…</p>
              <p>But this created problems for <span>SLBP</span>… That
              chickenlittle2 may him/ herself may not know…</p>
              <p>a) Because of how <span>SLBP</span>’s manner of
              handling 179, often created a lot of problem whenever the spammed
              <span>S179</span> buses return to <span>BNL</span>.. There’s often an impulse load of 6 <span>S179</span> jamming up Jurong West St 64 &amp; Jurong West
              Central 3’s driveway… <span>SLBP</span>’s claim of traffic
              jam is excuse because I’ve observed that if whenever 179 is
              properly operated, the problematic queue is less or in fact, smooth
              sailing during certain peak hour timebelt!</p>
              <p>b) <span>S179</span> often couldn’t cope… BC become
              dangerous/ rude drivers… There was ever once the BC just didn’t
              bother to wait for alighting pax at 27231.. Until passengers openly
              scolded the BC…</p>
              <p>BC say why not alighting fast.. I myself blasted the BC… Why no
              179A bus to clear the crowd… keep on throwing 179 and
              underoperated… <span>SLBP</span> asking for it… In fact
              that very trip was crawling… took 30 mins to get from 27211 to
              <span>BNL</span> Int…</p>
              <p>c) Pioneer – <span>NTU</span> shuttle bus? The bus freq
              is capped by <span>LTA</span> at 5 mins freq during the AM
              peak… and how many people can the buses carry?</p>
              <p>d) The problem with 179A so called less utilised is because
              <span>SLBP</span> in the past kept on feeding the trolls..
              at 27211 unofficial 179 freq set by <span>SLBP</span> is 3
              mins.. so people kept on taking 179… cos got priority in
              boarding…</p>
              <p>leaving 27231, 27251 with only 179A to take… leaving those
              people who really need 179 being unable to board the bus at all..
              bus just fly stop…</p>
              <p>e) There was an instance the Pioneer Rd Nth and Jurong West St
              63/ Pioneer Stn was congested with the factory buses… But
              <span>SLBP OCC</span> didn’t declare anything… and only
              179 was able to be dispatched at 6 mins per bus.. Even <span>S241</span> also lambat…</p>
              <p>But what to do? <span>S179</span> managed to pull out
              ghost buses to maintain headways… Is this fair to <span>S241</span> commuters or not?</p>
              <p>So.. <span>SLBP</span> kept on manipulating the bus
              schedules… Until the whole place’s demand mgmt and other bus svs’s
              ops end up so messy…</p>

              <p>sbst275, your main complain is only the PM peak right? Apart from the PM peak timebelt, 179 operates way better than many other bus services (incl feeder services). Why ? Because this service is operating at 3-5 mins and 5-7 mins during the noon and night time. <br><br>As I mentioned earlier, I believe every 179A deployed is operating at a loss and it is very difficult to control these short-trip buses even when there is a schedule. It make it worst when the demand and traffic conditions varies everyday. More importatnly,  putting more 179A would just deprive commuter along Pioneer Rd Nth. <br><br>It is seriously unfair to criticise the mangement to that extent when I believe they have been trying their very best. It is not an easy task to transfer a large crowd from Pt A to B during the peak hours. Pls kindly be contented and appreciate the service provided to you now.  </p>

              Dear Chickenlittle2, in the first place... Is it a breach of BSEP QoS that SLBP refused to operate 179A? LTA senior staff have told me that's it not allowed and they have stepped into the matter after knowing what's going on...
              
              Dun tell me be content... SLBP breaching BSEP QoS is already a no no... Service delivery is not simi be content whatever nonsense... 6 - 8 mins headways means 6 - 8 mins...
              
              Are you sure 179 is following the stipulated headways of 5 - 7 mins? Then explain how come 179A kept on running without proper headways?
              
              and in fact your SLBP is making a loss instead... They still dreaming inbound can collect 41c per pax huh? 
              
              179 is no longer profitable w/ distance fare... Even as SLBP abused by throwing all the S179A duties into 179... The inbound PM peak can only yield $3 the most... 
              
              Imagine this... 179A is running at 70% load... The taking is about $80... This is only when bus is 70% loaded... Even if the bus takes in 100 pax, the taking is about $95...
              
              But 179... The inbound can only collect $3, outbound thanks to so many people alighting at Pioneer [avg fare is about $0.75]... Total taking is only worth $93... 
              
              Carry bus until runtime is 30 mins lambat like siao, BC bo chap about alighting pax at South Spine... Only collect less than what 179A can potentially collect in reality...
              
              Dun tell what going express along Pioneer Rd Nth = not making money.... Is it worth to spam so many 179 in the first place? Can SLBP properly manage or not?
              
              Somemore explain why Pioneer Stn just now massive jam until traffic blockade when S179 arrive bunching? While it's free flow entry into BNL alighting bay this evening?
              
              The worst thing is with only 23 buses running around, SLBP kept on underoperating S179 with the way they operated the buses... Made worst is the ops created so much jam at BNL since the buses often bunches up..

              Furthermore 179A was operated to minimise the loss alrdy...
              
              The total runtime is about 42 mins and it could have collected nearly $90 - $100...
              
              179 runtime 50 - 55 mins can only collect $93 the most...
              
              So who is running at a loss???
              
              Dunno how to do up the sums, then say so..
              
              and somemore... Pioneer MRT Stn last Friday got MRT disruption and EWL trains turnaround at Boon Lay... how ar??? SLBP got send TI to 649A bus stop to help out or not?

              I still remember in the past, the AM peak was equally as bad...
              
              The timekeeper too lazy to bother to clear the crowd at BNL... Soon people began to just queue for S179 instead since they kept on over-operating 179...
              
              Ends up people along the way cannot board at all... The 73c or 93c fare that can be collected from along the way pax trying to get into NTU couldn't be collected at all.. And the buses have to face alighting pax along the way [those who didn't want to wait for 241].
              
              That's why SLBP bus rts never make money... Act smart, think like this is more profitable when it's even more loss making... Made worst, S179 didn't even meet QoS in reality.
              
              People at Braddell and Sin Ming made it a point to create 179A to cut down the number of buses and cut down the runtime for most buses in and out of NTU, without compromising the number of bus trips committed to NTU. As if they dunno 179 is not making money... only SLBP very smart...
              
              Very smart until w/o realising how unprofitable S179 inbound actually is during PM peak... Still dreaming can collect 41 cents per pax... 
              
              You cut down on the runtime, you can effectively reduce the number of buses needed and eventually cut down on cost effectively... This is the proper way!
              
              Great.. SLBP very smart on collecting those $3 and dunno how to manage the crowd dispersal in reality... Need me to remind of how I ended up have to blast off the BC for scolding pax for being slow trying to alight from a overloaded S179 bus. 
              
              The best is during exam period... SLBP still throw 179A only as downroute when the exam venues are near 27311, 27211. That's why 179A empty buses ma!
              
              Or SLBP dispatching 179A only at 4pm, 5pm when lesson time ends at 4:30pm, 5:30pm... Act smart, who told your people end lesson at 4pm or 5pm one? NTUSU people? So that can manipulate saying 179A no people take?
              
              Take company's bus resources to be played? SLBP really very clever...
              
              Seriously not I want to reveal, I've been suspecting SLBP staff were contacted by people in NTU asking for more S179 trips to Pioneer instead...

              The ayam still want to refute all this and say SLBP is coping and should be content.... Wait till you yourself get into trouble over QoS... $100k fine.
              
              Then may I ask how come Rts like 251 off peak is unprofitable but SLBP is following the bus schedule dispatch?
              
              Also S241 is unprofitable in the evening in reality... 1x round trip can collect get to collect $15 - $20 the most. Even less yielding that S179 in the evening... No more pao jiak $0.23 per pax. 
              
              But SLBP still operate... Why?
              
              Or is it still thinking this is stage based fare era?
              
              fyi.. Adult fare from 27211 to BNL Int is $1.03 alrdy.. no more $0.93...
              
              Which is why I've always find SLBP's reasons as excuses... Simply either dun want to operate, or act smart or actually NTU people asking SLBP to operate more 179.. Since people at Braddell and Sin Ming have already said NO to more buses at Pioneer due to traffic constraints.

              <p>Operating more 179A doesn't mean things will resolve, in fact it is making more chaos. Your fantastic story is to tell the whole world that 179 belongs to NTU and it should only solely bring pax from NTU to BNL or vice versa.</p>
              <p>Talking about the jam at BNL, u can ask those people in green and u would know that 179A is the real culprit. Imagine following your theory by putting in more 179A, one stupid jam along Pioneer Road North will result in 5-6 179A entering BNL back to back. <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Then take super long to alight. Worst still, it does not help to cope the 179 crowd at BNL, cos it need to go OS back to NTU. In the end, 241 is the one being affected badly. Got to face jam at BNL then still gotta pick up the ppl along Pioneer Road Nth. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Do you the jam at BNL is worst then Pioneer now? It can take more than 7 mins to enter BNL during the evening peak hrs. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Can you kindly tell me what's the diff or how can this be resolve? Tell me, how can those people in HQ understand the real situation that the ppl in BNL are facing? Based on records? </span></p>
              <p>I am quite sceptical on what you mentioned or suggested really benefit the majority of the students or just a fraction of them. Because as most of us do know that most students actually want to get on to the train as soon as possible. I even complaint on SBST not operating enough 179? Is like WTH.. when u run A, u get complain from people not able to board along Pioneer Rd nth and students cant access to the train quickly. So, u tell me, listen to whose complain? delight who first?<br><br>I believe most students would know that taking 179A is almost the same or sometime even increases their travelling time as they are travelling along the same route and experience the same traffic condition, and got to go all the way to BNL. <br><br>I did an observation in the evening ytd and I saw more pax on 179 than 179A again. The first bus 179 - 90% loading, second bus 179A- 80%, third bus 179A- 40%, fourth bus 179 - 90%, fifth bus 179A - 60%.   </p>
              <p>Anyway, did 179 appear in the list of bus services violating the Qos standard?</p>

              <p><br>199 capacity has been upgraded quite a bit. It used to be 4 DD / 4 SD - now it is 6 DD / 2 SD. 199 serves the north leg of the campus that is not as busy as the area where 179 operates. Yet when classes leave 199 can get really packed. On an average each bus will clock at least 55-60 pax on 199.</p>

              <p>Not a bad idea for him to join the transport industry. It will knock some sense into him very quickly and he won't be posting anything online after signing the OSA/NDA, ever.</p>

              <p><br>yes of course 199 can't be compared to 179 as it just serves the north leg. But can tell you when the classes leave, you can have good number of people taking it. Hence, I think they upgraded 2 SD slots to DD. Whenever I have taken it, it has between 65-80 pax.</p>

              In the first place, what's on the e-guide is 5 - 7 mins for S179 during the PM peak. 
              
              Yet today, I still see S179 running at 4 mins.. The next thing was the brunching S179 blocking the road at 27211 because the 2nd bay is occupied by internal shuttle or S179A... That S179 bus was holding up traffic for some 1.5 mins... 
              
              Then BC still want to stop inside zig zag line even after he has already signalled intension to move off... That began my suspicion... How come BC so nice, heck care abt traffic rule to pick up pax... Obviously SLBP manipulating bus schedule again.... only 179 plying 27211.... might as well pick up since next bus is 179 which would end up full... lor...
              
              Oh... S179 overoperated at 4 mins, S179A no bus... Freq at about 12 - 20 mins...
              
              The best is.. some S179 trips even entered NTU empty! Pioneer Rd Nth no passenger to bring in... So how now... Incur runtime and still no pax?
              
              The average over-operated S179 was about 5% loading into NTU... That's like giving only some $0.80 of fare on average.... The outbound was full, average taking should be around $88... That's with 55 mins of total runtime...
              
              The S179A corresponding trip took up about 90 passengers with taking at around $85 also... 42 mins of runtime...
              
              As for the data... Dun tell me what OSA.. The figure was given by LTA via corp comms... So dun jump into conclusion that all these info are sensitive... It's all given openly... 
              
              As for negotiable... Baseless allegation... Alrdy there's 2 incidents of MRT BLE breaking down during the S179A PM peak slot within 1 month... Dun tell me there's totally no loading/ bus stop mess happened at Pioneer Stn where pax of overoperated S179 alight... to find themselves to fight with those originally stranded at Pioneer for a bus to Boon Lay...
              
              This problem is compounded w/ all the factory buses, NTU shuttle bus pax.. All would be fighting for spaces on 179, 241, 255 &amp; 257.
              
              It's just like what happened at Bishan Stn in Dec 2011 when the NSL broke down... The CCL kept on feeding people... The next thing within 20 mins, the Bishan Rd northbound bus stop crowd had spilled over to the left lane...
              
              Furthermore, anti SMRT? Then explain why LTA simply is not re-routing 182 into Joo Koon Stn or Pioneer Stn right now? People work so far, they should be given access to nearest MRT Stn instead!
              
              There's NTU students who has to do IA at Tuas South... So why no one is suggesting to LTA get 182 to ply Pioneer Stn instead?
              
              There's obviously reasons behind all these...
