              <p>Actually, it depends. I will look into the suggestion/request
              made and review the related data (e.g. bus loading) to see if it is
              really the case.</p>
              <p>If it is really the case, I will accept it and work on it.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I will reject him in a kind manner. I would explain
              to him why his suggestions are not feasible.</p>
              <p>If this person keeps making the same suggestion/request even
              after I reject it, it is considered harassment/nuisance.</p>
              <p>If this is at personal level, I can apply for protection from
              that person, as he is harassing me.</p>
              <p>If this is at organisation level, I can ban him from commenting

              <p>Let's try something harder. Assume that every post the 179A lobbyist writes on Facebook is each separate email sent to LTA or/and SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>Ignore whatever allegations he thinks is happening behind the scenes, and assume that every fact about bus arrival is factually correct (i.e. when he said the bus did not arrive for 25 mins, it did in fact not arrive for 25 mins).</p>

              <p>Now, let's throw in a fictional scenario to increase the difficulty further: a fellow lobbyist in Pioneer is irate at 179/A having too many buses, thinking it came at an expense of his own service (e.g. 181/241/242).</p>

              <p>Because I have lived in Perth, experienced their GCM and know
              what is exactly happening. LTA is adopting the Perth/WA model

              the show.</p>
              <p>The 179A lobbyist will ragequit if he were to be studying in UWA
