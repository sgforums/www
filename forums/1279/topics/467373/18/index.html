              <p>Good job to introduce 55B from 7pm onwards. This will give better frequency to NSL people to AMK Ave 10 (south). Those coming from CBD can alight at Bishan and take 55 to their homes than go to AMK and then 261. Will ease the load on 261 with this move.</p>
              <p>AM peak no need because I see people crossing road when they see a 55 coming to take it to Bishan. I think they will have 1 or 2 buses for 55B crossover from 55? Mostly, SDs should be used.</p>

              <p>Yeah weekends loading can be quite low especially off peak.
              Hence, there is a large number of SDs deployed.</p>

              <p>Been more than 1 year since 116 was launched. Pax improved a bit from 14-16 pax boarding at HCI to now 18-21. aM peak though has only 4-5 pax boarding.</p>

              <p>Yes you are trying to act smart. Why were you suggesting route changes to 116? It is BSEP right. So let it be. BSEP is meant to provide more convenience to people and relieve loading in crowded sectors. Let me put some things into perspective.</p>
              <p>1. There is no harm in revising some BSEP services if you realize they are not bring as effective as thought during planning the route. Happens. No one is perfect in estimating loading. </p>
              <p>2. 116 should have called at the stop outside NEX if it truly meant to relieve loading. On way to Serangoon, people also have alternative with 103, 147. In PM peak, the whole crowd waits at NEX, pushing the capacity to max on services like 43, 70. In fact, some people along Serangoon Nth Ave 1 and 4 also don't mind still taking 315 at NEX as travel time is not significantly higher. 116 PM at stop opp NEX takes less than 20pax. Such a waste when opp side buses are not able to cope with the high loading. </p>
              <p>3. You don't need a 116 at HG ave 9 to HG  int. There is a 72 with Frequency of 5-6 mins. People along st 91, 93 are the ones who really need more buses. St 91 could get a new stop. 116 could have gone via st 91, st 51 to HG Ave 8 and then Int. This way you would provided higher connectivity. 116 buses go empty to HG int which is a waste when it could have really helped people along the inner streets instead of plying the ave 9/4 that are already pampered with multiple high frequency, DD services. </p>
              <p>4. If after a year of launch, you still realize that 116 has not picked up, you should modify the route under BSEP to help more commuters. Is there anything wrong with that?</p>
