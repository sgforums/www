              <p>Here is my proposal.</p>
              <p><strong>SBST services that require DD -&gt; SD downgrade</strong></p>
              <p>31 -&gt; can downgrade 2 DDs to SDs. Loading has dropped majorly over the last year, and more so with launch of sv 47. ITE sector is covered by 31A DDs.</p>
              <p>119 -&gt; DEFINITELY need to take out the DDs. I dont think even one trip gets more than 60 pax these days. </p>
              <p>256 -&gt; Make full fleet SD. Please don't waste precious DDs on this useless service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wait and Watch</strong></p>
              <p>41 --&gt; the loading between Toh Guan and Beauty World still remains in 30-50 pax manageable by SDs but frequency is quite poor of 12-19 mins. Maybe more time needs to be given to see if people are changing their travel pattern to use DTL2 from Toh Guan/Toh Tuck</p>
              <p>47 --&gt; the loading is borderline DD for now, hence more time needs to be given before any change is made. Also I am told that a lot of people still hold private bus pass for the year from Tanah Merah to Changi Business Park. </p>
              <p>102 -&gt; as of now DDs are not well utilized but the occupancy of flats along Sengkang West Way remains low, likewise Upper Serangoon Road. </p>
              <p>117 -&gt; as of now DDs are not well utilized but <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">the occupancy of flats along Canberra, Yishun Ave 1, Seletar Aerospace (industrial units) &amp; Punggol West remains low</span></p>
              <p>258 -&gt; loading remains between 40-60 pax during peak hours. The assumption that people would choose Pioneer MRT to travel to st 81/82 hasn't really hold true. People still prefer taking bus to/fro Boon Lay Interchange. Again, more time needs to be given to see if people change their travel habit. Current frequency remains at 12-15 mins.</p>

                          <p>meanwhile, there's very long queues for 193 at Boon Lay Bus Interchange in the evening and night. I think 242 also. I feel that 258 may be re-routed to run along Jurong West Avenue 4. Otherwise, a new bus route may be created.</p>
                          <p>Actually, no matter how low the loading may be, the most is just to downgrade the capacity to use Citaro buses. 258 is there because some bus services are transferred from Boon Lay to Joo Koon. 99 and 258 is to provide the "feeder" bus connection between Jurong West residential area and Joo Koon Bus Interchange. Once again, since 258's role is to complement the other Jurong industrial bus services at Joo Koon Bus Interchange, I feel that we should increase its frequency to match that of 253, 254, 255, 257. If need be, downgrade the capacity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>whereas for 41, most of the areas along the route are private residential apartments. There are only a few HDB flats at Beauty World area. As for the area around Jurong East Central, there are already many bus services. I guess it is not likely that the loading will increase, at least in the next five years.</p>

              <p>All your suggestions are good, though 7 is doing fine for now. 185 is also doing okay. 243G/W has way too many buses and can cut some SDs. Likewise for other feeders like 291/291/222. </p>

              <p>The problem with Gek Poh area is that most people live along Jurong West Street 72, yet all the direct bus connections to Boon Lay Bus Interchange are at Jurong West Street 75. The closest direct bus connection from Jurong West Street 72 is provided by bus 193 along Jurong West Avenue 4. Previously, there was 192 and 193. Now, there is only 193. This explains the very long queue for 193 at the bus interchange in evening.</p>
                  <p>I would like to recommend a new feeder route and an amendment to feeder 243.</p>
                  <p>This new feeder route shall recover the loss of 192 at Jurong West Avenue 4, by plying along Jurong West Street 64 and Avenue 4 in both directions. It can loop via Pioneer Road North, Jurong West Avenue 5 and Street 71.</p>
                  <p>feeder 243 can be amended slightly to run direct on Jurong West Street 71, between Jurong West Street 61 and 81. This would benefit the people living in blks 701-710, as they nolonger need to cross the main roads (Avenue 5, Avenue 4, Pioneer Road North) or only take bus 243W home. This shortens route 243 and reduces the number of buses required.</p>
                  <p>258 can be re-routed to skip Jurong West Street 71, and instead ply Jurong West Avenue 5, Pioneer Road North and Jurong West Avenue 4 - effectively compensate people affected by 243 amendment, together with the new feeder at Avenue 4 and 179/241 at Street 63.</p>
                  <p>Actually, I would want feeder 242 to take shortcut, while have a new feeder to take over Jalan Boon Lay and also take on Jurong West Avenue 3. I suggested this in 2014, and was opposed because apparently there is demand for bus connection between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and the cluster of temples at Avenue 4. So, never mind.</p>
                  <p>I feel that for Gek Poh area, a new feeder at Avenue 4 and amendments to 243 and 258 would be greatly appreciated by the people living here. :)</p>

                                      <p>My suggestion for fleet upgrade/downgrade:</p>
                      <p>258 can operate on a fleet of 7 buses to boost frequency with 4
                      SD 3 DD (192's only KUB can swap with a DD from 258, 193 can swap 2
                      SD for 2 DD) as 258's role is to serve as a supplementary service
                      between St 81 to BNL, but still receives some demand from Jurong
                      Camp during evening peak hours (it compliments 192 to Pioneer
                      MRT)</p>
                      <p>256 can operate on 6 buses (4AP/2S on weekdays) on full SD
                      fleet</p>
                      <p>30 can have a fleet upgrade from SLBP side for 2 SD -&gt; DD
                      conversion (swap with 256 DD, leaving 2824C <span style="line-height: 1.231;">as the only SD from SLBP as it is the 536
                      crossover)</span></p>
                      <p>111 can add 1 more AP DD, 111 frequency can hit as long as
                      17-19mins during nighttime and SD can be packed from Orchard
                      Road</p>
                      <p>98 can remove the SD (or replace the SD with a DD)</p>
                      <p>7 needs to upgrade the SD slots to DD slots (4 SD to DD upgrade,
                      leaving 6665T as the only SD on 7)</p>
                      <p>185 can add 1 more AP SD to boost frequency (frequency can be as
                      long as 19mins during off peak)</p>
                      <p>243G/W can cut 2 WAB SD each and replace it with 1 DD as I feel
                      243G/W fleet is really too many buses</p>

                      <p>With regards to 185, I know how it feels to wait for the bus in the morning. I used to rely on bus 185 to get to school, from Jurong West Avenue 5.</p>
                  <p>185 frequency was quite long. This was especially when my school was at Jurong West Street 25 and only 185 goes there, while the other schools' students had both 99 and 185, and also 502. This is why I suggested that if we merge 49 and 258, the merged route should run along Jurong West Avenue 3, Street 23/22, because the bus connection between avenue 3 and the avenue 5/1 is quite weak, but that BusAnalayzer kept insisting that it ply Avenue 4. -.=</p>
                  <p>I ever wrote an email to SBS Transit to consider shortening 185 to Jurong East Bus Interchange so that the frequency can be higher, but their reply was that the route planning is now centrally done by the LTA. Soon after that email, SBS brought forward the first trip of 185.</p>
                   <p>The demand on bus 185 during weekday morning from 6:30am to around 7am is consistently high due to the large number of students using it to get to school. I do not know about the frequency now. If it is low (around fifteen minutes) , I feel that bus 185 deserves better frequency. Otherwise, a weekday short-working trip of 185 between Soon Lee Depot and Jurong West Avenue 3 would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>

              <p>frequent bunching is due to 315 with full fleet rigids. 4 rigids on 315 to swap with 2 DDs on 119.</p>
