              <p>My opinion to your point is that even BSEP buses breakdown <span style="line-height: 1.231;">as well...but I also feel that there are too many Enviro500s not yet settled on perms, more than the amount of BSEP spares needed.</span></p>
              <p>But then again, do I suspect the format for BSEP buses i<span style="line-height: 1.231;">n SgWiki mislead you in one way or another?</span></p>

              <p>my guess is for some time services will continue to operate as they are. After observation on loading, LTA can take a call to modify/merge/withdraw services. It should not be done hastily and at least 6 months breathing period should b there before any changes are made. </p>
              <p>Did DTL1 impact any services? I still see Sv 2/12 getting good loading between Chinatown and Bugis... </p>
              <p>Not sure if dtl1 is very successful as of now coz trains are relatively quite empty. Once DTL 2 opens... Loading will bump up...</p>

              <p>For 229 its Chai Chee St/Rd leg has to do with its roots of being a ex-Chai Chee Ter sv. But you can't possibly leave Chai Chee St (between Chai Chee Rd &amp; Bedok North Ave 1) w/o a bus sv right, just like how you complained of other areas such as Haig Rd with no bus sv? Only 229 serves that sector presently (222 enters from New Upp Changi Rd and Chai Chee Rd and turn left to Chai Chee St).</p>
              <p>For 282 maybe they should have just left sv287 behind in the 1980s and withdraw sv282, showing that routes in the past may not fit usage nowadays.</p>
              <p>For 300 add 975 as an alternative for Ave 3 side, which partially causes the overcrowding of sv975 during weekdays peak.</p>
              <p>For 315 I'd say leave the North Ave 1 part around. At least commuters in S'goon Gdn can get home (to Sgn North Ave 1) directly w/o trf at S'goon Int to your "proposed 116."</p>
              <p>For 325 the "winding part" between Hougang Ave 10, Ave 2 and Upp S'goon Rd was added during NEL bus rationalization. Redundant move made by the authorities then.</p>
              <p>For 333 I agree, but at least the alternatives are there for Toh Guan Rd residents. 41, 52, 105, 990.</p>
              <p>For 372 the Punggol Rd leg was only added in 2007 lol. I agree that that sector has a lot of room for improvement in terms of demand.</p>

              <p>When the new flats at Ave 5/Old Keat Hong Camp are completed, 300 may be split up to have 2 separate svcs looping at Ave 5 and Ave 2. That whole area at the old Keat Hong Camp will likely see several new routes under BSEP.</p>
              <p>While we have many existing feeder routes that are long and winding due to svcs being merged or amended to cover more areas in the past, the trend nowadays seems to be shorter and more direct feeder svcs connecting a specific area to the nearest bus int/MRT. Though I agree that some existing routes can be amended to be more direct, LTA may prefer to just leave them alone.</p>

              St).</p>
              <p>For 282 maybe they should have just left sv287 behind in the
              1980s and withdraw sv282, showing that routes in the past may not
              fit usage nowadays.</p>
              <p>For 300 add 975 as an alternative for Ave 3 side, which
              partially causes the overcrowding of sv975 during weekdays
              peak.</p>
              <p>For 315 I'd say leave the North Ave 1 part around. At least
              commuters in S'goon Gdn can get home (to Sgn North Ave 1) directly
              w/o trf at S'goon Int to your "proposed 116."</p>
              <p>For 325 the "winding part" between Hougang Ave 10, Ave 2 and Upp
              S'goon Rd was added during NEL bus rationalization. Redundant move
              made by the authorities then.</p>
              <p>For 333 I agree, but at least the alternatives are there for Toh
              Guan Rd residents. 41, 52, 105, 990.</p>
              <p>For 372 the Punggol Rd leg was only added in 2007 lol. I agree
              that that sector has a lot of room for improvement in terms of
              demand.</p>

              <p>On 229: I agree that we cannot possibly have Chai Chee St/rd without a service and 229 is historical. I get that as well. My proposal would be to have another service ply Chai Chee St / Rd.</p>
              <p>Proposal 1: Have Sv 9 or Sv 35 diverted via New Upper Changi Rd, Chai Chee Rd, Chai Chee St before entering Bedok Interchange. Advantage: No commuters upset as ppl take this service from Bedok MRT stop rather than interchange. Also provides connectivity to Tanah Merah, Bedok Sports Complex to Chai Chee residents. Cons: None.</p>
              <p>Proposal 2: Have Sv 26 enter Chai Chee before terminating at Bedok Interchange. Advantage: Chai Chee residents get direct connection to Eunos, Geylang areas. Cons: since it is trunk service with not very good frequency, Chai Chee residents could get stranded to get to MRT. This still could be a supplementary service given current 26 is quite redundant in its route.</p>
              <p>Proposal 3: New service 224 from Bedok Interchange, New Upper Changi Rd, Chai Chee Rd, Chai Chee St, Bedok Interchange. Pros: New direct service with enhanced frequency. 3 Citaros under BSEP enough. Will also benefit new Chai Chee BTO with an stop for 222/224 on Chai Chee rd. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cons: None. </span></p>
              <p>With any of these 3 proposals, 229 can serve residents of Bedok South road more efficiently providing direct connectivity and lesser commute time. </p>

              <p>When the new flats at Ave 5/Old Keat Hong Camp are completed,
              300 may be split up to have 2 separate svcs looping at Ave 5 and
              Ave 2. That whole area at the old Keat Hong Camp will likely see
              several new routes under BSEP.</p>
              <p>While we have many existing feeder routes that are long and
              winding due to svcs being merged or amended to cover more areas in
              the past, the trend nowadays seems to be shorter and more direct
              feeder svcs connecting a specific area to the nearest bus int/MRT.
              Though I agree that some existing routes can be amended to be more
              direct, LTA may prefer to just leave them alone.</p>

              <p>Keat Hong area will need a short trunk like Sv 860 connecting both CCK and BPJ via Keat Hong. Should also have a trunk service connecting Bukit Batok area to Keat Hong. I will also prefer if Sv 700 is extended to CCK via Keat Hong, providing direct city access. So def I suspect and recommend 2-3 services. </p>

              <p>That's why using DDs solely is still the most desirable solution for space-crunch Singapore, even if it has its disadvantages when deployed on short trunk and feeder routes like sv300. Encouraging more commuters to move to the upper deck may not be easy, but at least it's achievable.</p>
