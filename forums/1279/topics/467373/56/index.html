              <p>If u wanna do maths here, do it at a symposium or a algorithm class or a binary class. Ur statistics is ambiguous to say the least. U didnt even consider people who drive in, who ride in, whose parents send, </p>
              <p>So u are trying to say that those statistics are those who take public buses? U wanna make another service to NTU/NIE. 179 is more than enough for the students there. I dont need to go school there to know that 179 frequency is damn high that there are 10 buses bunching. </p>

              <p>I would like to ask, does bus services 179 and 179A use the same
              fleet of buses?</p>
              <p>If so, bus services 179 and 179A is considered one public bus
              service, not two. This means there are two public bus services –
              179/179A and 199 – serving the students of NTU, not three.</p>
              <p>Capacity wise, as mentioned, bus service 179’s maximum capacity
              is 3,257 pax/hr (131 × 25), whereas bus service 199’s maximum
              capacity is around 1,297 pax/hr [(131 × 8) + (83 × 3)]. Total
              maximum capacity is 4,554 pax/hr (3,257 + 1,297).</p>
              <p>There are 24,300 students in NTU. The maximum capacity of the
              two public bus services 179/179A and 199 is able to cater for
              18.74% of the student population in NTU [(4,554/24,300) x
              100%].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, at NUS (Kent Ridge), there are four public bus
              services 95, 96, 151, 151E. but forget about 151E as that is a
              fast-forward variant of 151 (charge higher fares, and uses the same
              fleet as 151). so, it's only three bus services 95, 96, 151.</p>
              <p>Bus Service 95 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 5 single
              decker buses; its maximum capacity is 808 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x
              5)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 96 uses up to 11 double decker buses and 14 single
              decker buses; its maximum capacity is 2,603 pax/hr [(131 x 11) +
              (83 x 14)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 151 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 23 single
              decker buses. there's apparently supposed to be one more bus in the
              equation, but, let's assume it's a single decker bus. so, the
              maximum capacity is 2,385 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x 24)].</p>
              <p>In total, the three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 have the
              maximum capacity of around 5,796 pax/hr (808 + 2,603 + 2,385).</p>
              <p>There are 28,311 students in NUS. The maximum capacity of the
              three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 is able to cater for
              20.47% of the student population in NUS [(5,796/28,311) x
              100%].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
              public-bus-to-student proportion is higher in NUS (20.47%) than in
              NTU (18.74%).</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>To be fair, I feel that we should increase the
              public-bus-to-student proportion in NTU by 1.73%</strong> (20.47 -
              18.74)<strong>, to match the public-bus-to-student proportion in
              NUS.</strong> This means an increase of the maximum capacity of the
              public bus services in NTU by 420.39 pax/hr [(1.73/100) x 24,300],
              which is about the capacity of one public bus service.</p>
              <p><strong>In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we need one new public bus service in
              NTU</span>, to make the public-bus-to-student proportion in NTU
              equal to the public-bus-to-student proportion in NUS</strong>; just
              introduce one new public bus service in NTU, and the students in
              NTU would have nothing to complain about the public bus service in
              NTU already.</p>
              <p>420.39 pax/hr is about two double decker buses and two single
              decker buses (262 + 166 = 428) combined. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can have one new public bus
              service at Boon Lay Bus Interchange that loops at
              NTU.</span></strong> We can put this new public bus service and 179
              and 179A at the same boarding berth. This new public bus service,
              with a maximum of four buses, can operate at a constant frequency
              of fifteen minutes. Buses can be transferred from 179 to this new
              bus service, to sort of enable higher frequency and “balance a
              bit”, as long as the looping point is the same. To optimise
              resources, this new public bus service can take an alternative
              route between Boon Lay and NTU, that is shorter/faster, and may
              enhance the intra-town public bus connection in Jurong West.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here, I would like to make a route suggestion:</p>
              <p>New bus service 152</p>
              <p>Boon Lay Bus Interchange to NTU (loop); approximately nine
              kilometres; approximately forty five minutes of run time.</p>

              <p>Are u serious? Another service into NTU? I would rather they open a 179B that runs counterclockwise of 179 and 179A, for the benefit of students studying in south spine... but then using 179 original fleet is enough... the fleet is really too much!!</p>

                                  decker buses (262 + 166 = 428) combined. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can have one new public bus
                                  service at Boon Lay Bus Interchange that loops at
                                  NTU.</span></strong> We can put this new public bus service and 179
                                  and 179A at the same boarding berth. This new public bus service,
                                  with a maximum of four buses, can operate at a constant frequency
                                  of fifteen minutes. Buses can be transferred from 179 to this new
                                  bus service, to sort of enable higher frequency and â€œbalance a
                                  bitâ€�, as long as the looping point is the same. To optimise
                                  resources, this new public bus service can take an alternative
                                  route between Boon Lay and NTU, that is shorter/faster, and may
                                  enhance the intra-town public bus connection in Jurong West.</p>

                                  <p>I am sorry. What I meant is the proportion of public bus capacity to student population in NTU. It is lower than the proportion of public bus capacity to student population in NUS. To be fair, I feel that we should have one new public bus service to make up for the disparity of public bus capacity proportion.</p>
                                  <p>I know there are private shuttle buses in NTU. They can (continue to) use Pioneer MRT Station - like how the private shuttle buses at NUS use Kent Ridge MRT Station.</p>
                                  <p>I feel that the proportion of buses - public and private - to students in NTU is lower than that in NUS.</p> <p>If we increase the proportion to make it equal to the one in NUS, I think this will settle the issue of buses in NTU once and for all, and enable the "student activists" of NTU to move on to focus on other things.</p>

              <p>256 and 243W go well together and 258 and 243G. But instead they did a stupid berth allocation. I can understand for 72B and 72 there is separate allocation of berth because you want to make sure those going further on ave 5 get a place in the bus. </p>
              <p>But in this case, buses run empty from interchange while the queue for 243G/W continues to be snaky and then they have to add buses. If that's the case don't even bother to get 258 and 256 to Boon Lay and hog interchange space. Rather let them loop around ave 5 and ave 4 respectively. Will make them more useful as well. </p>

              <p>Meanwhile, I have never seen people complain about the bus service in NUS. Happened to visit NUS last year. When I was there, I saw many buses. It could be due to the high proportion (ratio) of bus capacity to student population, that is why no one complains about the bus service in NUS.</p>
                      
                      <p>Whereas for NTU, the bus service can be better. Like I have said, the proportion (ratio) of bus capacity to student population in NTU is lower than that in NUS. The thing is that NTU has more students than NUS, so naturally NTU needs more bus capacity. Try taking bus 179/179A in the morning, together with the students of NTU, and arrive at a lecture theatre in NTU at 8am. From what I heard, there are many people taking the bus, and it's quite hard to take the bus.</p>
                      
                      <p>The other reason for suggesting a new bus service is actually because it seems that bus service 179/179A has too many buses, that the frequency is as low as two minutes. When there's too many buses, it becomes very hard to manage. I am not sure if "dis-economies of scale" is the term to describe it, but anyway, I feel that if we create a new bus service and transfer some of 179/179A's buses to this new bus service, it would make it easier to manage bus service 179/179A, and it would allow for a slight increament (1.73%) of proportion of public bus capacity to student population in NTU to match that of NUS.</p>
                      
                      <p>As far as I know, no one complains about the bus service in NUS, unlike in NTU where there are people complaining about the bus service there. Well, NUS has Clementi Bus Interchange, NTU has Boon Lay Bus Interchange. NUS has Kent Ridge MRT Station, NTU has Pioneer MRT Station. The infrastructure is about the same. I do not see why the proportion of bus capacity to student population cannot be the same. If we make the bus service in NTU the same as the bus service in NUS, I am sure no one would complain about the bus service in NTU.</p>
                      
                      <p>By the way, I do not think it is only one person complaining. Maybe there is only one person complaining on social media, but for the many other people, they are either complaining on other platforms or simply regarding it as a daily routine of having to struggle to get to school on time using public transport.</p>
                      
                      <p>I do not understand the negativity here. You all say that it is very good; no need to improve, but do you all actually know the actual situation on the ground? Probably no.</p>
                      
                      <p>By the way, what is wrong about being a concerned citizen and caring for the community? I do not understand the opposition here. Sorry.</p>

              <p>Since you have pointed out that "for the many other people, they are either complaining on other platforms or simply regarding it as a daily routine of having to struggle to get to school on time using public transport", how can you conclude that nobody is complaining about NUS?</p>

              <p>Are you even sure that <strong>nobody </strong>ever complains about buses at NUS? And in my opinion, honestly even if 1 extra service is added to NTU, there will still be complains, in addition, not every student takes the bus to school (eg: cycle, drive etc)</p>
              <p>If one extra service is added to NTU, I think the situation will be even worse, 179 offers the direct connection fron NTU to Pioneer/Boon Lay with 179A clearing the crowd towards Boon Lay, adding 1 more service and reducing the number of buses on 179/A may result in 179 being more packed if the students are taking the MRT from Boon Lay/Pioneer.</p>
