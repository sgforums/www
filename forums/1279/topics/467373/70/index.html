              <p>Now only stated that Pasir Ris Int,Punggol Int and Changi
              Village Ter will be operated by GA.I wonder how they want to make
              36 terminate at CGA?Use T sign?Actually T2 can refurb into proper
              parking place for svc 34 &amp; 36.Office shifted to left side where
              the CAG officers park there..3 lots for 36 and 2 lots for
              34.Alighting berth should be before parking place..Can use 34/36T
              after Tomlinson Rd and Punggol Int for mealbreaks</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, so now Changi village terminal is counted as Go ahead or Sbs transit? You say go ahead. Lemon1974 says Sbs transit. Anyway I will go down to Changi village terminal this Sunday 18 sep to see the panels in the terminal myself. Then I will know. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I thought the work on Punggol interchange expansion already

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the signboard indicates Q3 2017 completion. Normally they either follow accordingly or delay. Seldom see construction and opening faster than initially planned. Just look at tampines extension and sengkang extension can tell. Up to today, there is no official mention of opening of sengkang extension. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, buses stopping there and interchange/terminal managed by a service provider are different cases. SMRT can say all they want but they are not the ones managing AMK, TAM, EUN. From what I see, Changi village terminal is managed by Sbs transit as there are totally no pre-information of Go ahead taking over. They have already announced taking over of pasir ris interchange prior to taking over the bus services. For Punggol, they also announced 2 weeks before taking over. Cheers.</p>
