              <p>I dunno why you must include Svc 117 as worst loading... It is also depending whether other buses is in front to take passengers to Yishun MRT/Int from these bus stops:</p>

              <p>I didn't include 102 and 117 because their loading is improving day by day.</p>
              <p>In fact, 102 can easily get 60-70 pax these days between Sengkang MRT and Sengkang West Way. Soon, the loading might cross 70 pax in this sector.</p>
              <p>117 loading also is improving and has huge potential in future.</p>
              <p>382 is another service which has &lt;10 pax on every bus, but has huge potential in future.</p>
              <p>115 was not included because the return leg back to Kovan can easily get 40-50 pax on the bus from HG Ave 3, Serangoon JC. Now that's not a bad loading.</p>

                                  <p>Yeah, bus service 179's capacity is up to 3,257 pax/hr. Bus Service 179A's capacity seems to be the same as 179, so let's assume it's also up to 3,257 pax/hr. In total, it's up to around 6,514 pax/hr.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>Meanwhile, bus service 199's estimated run time is 48 minutes, frequency ranges from 4 minutes to 16 minutes. At it's peak, Bus Service 199 runs on eight double decker buses and three single decker buses. Maximum capacity is at around 1,297 pax/hr [(131 Ã— 8) + (83 Ã— 3)].</p>
                                  
                                  <p>179, 179A and 199 combined maximum capacity is at around 7,811 pax/hr (6,514 + 1,297).</p>
                                  <p>Yet, NTU student population is 24,300.</p>
                                  <p>The existing public bus services at NTU has capacity for only up to 32.14% (7,811/24300 x 100) of the NTU student population, per hour.</p>
                                  <p>No wonder the students at NTU are complaining.</p>
                          <p>(but the way they complain really cannot make it, because not much substance to support their claims. sorry.)</p>
                                  <p>I would like to recommend around twelve more public bus services to serve the students at NTU, to provide up to 16,260.16 pax/hr during peak periods... although I do not know how it can be done.</p>

              <p>I didn't include 102 and 117 because their loading is improving

              <p>In fact, 102 can easily get 60-70 pax these days between
                  Sengkang MRT and Sengkang West Way. Soon, the loading might cross

              <p>117 loading also is improving and has huge potential in

              <p>382 is another service which has &lt;10 pax on every bus, but

              <p>115 was not included because the return leg back to Kovan can
                  easily get 40-50 pax on the bus from HG Ave 3, Serangoon JC. Now

              <p>179/A now runs on a full DD fleet daily, SD cameos are quite rare to the extent where it is considered rare to see even one SD operating on 179 (the last time I saw SD 179 was in Dec 2015 where 8129L cameoed 179), operating on full Wright fleet with VO3X making daily/occasional appearance, though bunching of 179 is extremely common on weekdays where 3-4 179 DDs can be seen plied back to back at Pioneer MRT towards Boon Lay, all less than half full, in my opinion, 179 is okay as it is now though off-peak loading can be a bit unpredictable as buses can be either quite packed or with less than 20 people on board.</p>
              <p>In addition, there is the NTU shuttle at Pioneer MRT where a queue can be seen queueing at the bus stop, the shuttle seems to have quite good frequency as there is a tendancy where two buses are at Pioneer MRT (one on standby while the other one picks up the passangers heading towards NTU, the shuttle can easily picks up about 40 passangers per bus with a queue waiting for the next bus)</p>

              <p>They can expect more of this under GCM. I remember Perth's version of 179A (predecessor to current 950) was once cut short in a similar manner, forcing people to change buses at Esplanade. That added on 30 minutes of journey time to the city.</p>
              <p>Within a couple of months, PTA (Perth's version of LTA) realized the game was up once everyone started clogging the road to the city with their own cars.</p>

              <p>I would like to ask, does bus services 179 and 179A use the same fleet of buses?</p>
              <p>If so, bus services 179 and 179A is considered one public bus service, not two. This means there are two public bus services – 179/179A and 199 – serving the students of NTU, not three.</p>
              <p>Capacity wise, as mentioned, bus service 179’s maximum capacity is 3,257 pax/hr (131 × 25), whereas bus service 199’s maximum capacity is around 1,297 pax/hr [(131 × 8) + (83 × 3)]. Total maximum capacity is 4,554 pax/hr (3,257 + 1,297).</p>
              <p>There are 24,300 students in NTU. The maximum capacity of the two public bus services 179/179A and 199 is able to cater for 18.74% of the student population in NTU [(4,554/24,300) x 100%].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, at NUS (Kent Ridge), there are four public bus services 95, 96, 151, 151E. but forget about 151E as that is a fast-forward variant of 151 (charge higher fares, and uses the same fleet as 151). so, it's only three bus services 95, 96, 151.</p>
              <p>Bus Service 95 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 5 single decker buses; its maximum capacity is 808 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x 5)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 96 uses up to 11 double decker buses and 14 single decker buses; its maximum capacity is 2,603 pax/hr [(131 x 11) + (83 x 14)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 151 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 23 single decker buses. there's apparently supposed to be one more bus in the equation, but, let's assume it's a single decker bus. so, the maximum capacity is 2,385 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x 24)].</p>
              <p>In total, the three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 have the maximum capacity of around 5,796 pax/hr (808 + 2,603 + 2,385).</p>
              <p>There are 28,311 students in NUS. The maximum capacity of the three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 is able to cater for 20.47% of the student population in NUS [(5,796/28,311) x 100%].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The public-bus-to-student proportion is higher in NUS (20.47%) than in NTU (18.74%).</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>To be fair, I feel that we should increase the public-bus-to-student proportion in NTU by 1.73%</strong> (20.47 - 18.74)<strong>, to match the public-bus-to-student proportion in NUS. </strong>This means an increase of the maximum capacity of the public bus services in NTU by 420.39 pax/hr [(1.73/100) x 24,300], which is about the capacity of one public bus service.</p>
              <p><strong>In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we need one new public bus service in NTU</span>, to make the public-bus-to-student proportion in NTU equal to the public-bus-to-student proportion in NUS</strong>; just introduce one new public bus service in NTU, and the students in NTU would have nothing to complain about the public bus service in NTU already.</p>
              <p>420.39 pax/hr is about two double decker buses and two single decker buses (262 + 166 = 428) combined. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We can have one new public bus service at Boon Lay Bus Interchange that loops at NTU.</span></strong> We can put this new public bus service and 179 and 179A at the same boarding berth. This new public bus service, with a maximum of four buses, can operate at a constant frequency of fifteen minutes. Buses can be transferred from 179 to this new bus service, to sort of enable higher frequency and “balance a bit”, as long as the looping point is the same. To optimise resources, this new public bus service can take an alternative route between Boon Lay and NTU, that is shorter/faster, and may enhance the intra-town public bus connection in Jurong West.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I would like to ask, does bus services 179 and 179A use the same
              fleet of buses?</p>
              <p>If so, bus services 179 and 179A is considered one public bus
              service, not two. This means there are two public bus services –
              179/179A and 199 – serving the students of NTU, not three.</p>
              <p>Capacity wise, as mentioned, bus service 179’s maximum capacity
              is 3,257 pax/hr (131 × 25), whereas bus service 199’s maximum
              capacity is around 1,297 pax/hr [(131 × 8) + (83 × 3)]. Total
              maximum capacity is 4,554 pax/hr (3,257 + 1,297).</p>
              <p>There are 24,300 students in NTU. The maximum capacity of the
              two public bus services 179/179A and 199 is able to cater for
              18.74% of the student population in NTU [(4,554/24,300) x
              100%].</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, at NUS (Kent Ridge), there are four public bus
              services 95, 96, 151, 151E. but forget about 151E as that is a
              fast-forward variant of 151 (charge higher fares, and uses the same
              fleet as 151). so, it's only three bus services 95, 96, 151.</p>
              <p>Bus Service 95 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 5 single
              decker buses; its maximum capacity is 808 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x
              5)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 96 uses up to 11 double decker buses and 14 single
              decker buses; its maximum capacity is 2,603 pax/hr [(131 x 11) +
              (83 x 14)].</p>
              <p>Bus Service 151 uses up to 3 double decker buses and 23 single
              decker buses. there's apparently supposed to be one more bus in the
              equation, but, let's assume it's a single decker bus. so, the
              maximum capacity is 2,385 pax/hr [(131 x 3) + (83 x 24)].</p>
              <p>In total, the three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 have the
              maximum capacity of around 5,796 pax/hr (808 + 2,603 + 2,385).</p>
              <p>There are 28,311 students in NUS. The maximum capacity of the
              three public bus services 95, 96 and 151 is able to cater for
              20.47% of the student population in NUS [(5,796/28,311) x
              100%].</p>

              <p>Doesn't 179 already loop at NTU from Boon Lay MRT? How is it different from 179?</p>
              <p>The only conceivable variation of the route would be to loop NTU counter-clockwise.</p>
              <p>Unless you intend to send them down all the way to Choa Chu Kang or Bukit Panjang.</p>
