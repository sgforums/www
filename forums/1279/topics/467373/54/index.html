              <p>With regards to 185, I know how it feels to wait for the bus in
              the morning. I used to rely on bus 185 to get to school, from
              Jurong West Avenue 5.</p>
              <p>185 frequency was quite long. This was especially when my school
              was at Jurong West Street 25 and only 185 goes there, while the
              other schools' students had both 99 and 185, and also 502. This is
              why I suggested that if we merge 49 and 258, the merged route
              should run along Jurong West Avenue 3, Street 23/22, because the
              bus connection between avenue 3 and the avenue 5/1 is quite weak,
              but that BusAnalayzer kept insisting that it ply Avenue 4. -.=</p>
              <p>I ever wrote an email to SBS Transit to consider shortening 185
              to Jurong East Bus Interchange so that the frequency can be higher,
              but their reply was that the route planning is now centrally done
              by the LTA. Soon after that email, SBS brought forward the first
              trip of 185.</p>
              <p>The demand on bus 185 during weekday morning from 6:30am to
              around 7am is consistently high due to the large number of students
              using it to get to school. I do not know about the frequency now.
              If it is low (around fifteen minutes) , I feel that bus 185
              deserves better frequency. Otherwise, a weekday short-working trip
              of 185 between Soon Lee Depot and Jurong West Avenue 3 would be
              greatly appreciated. :)</p>

              <p>You got it WRONG. I said it plies ave 5, Jalan Bahar and ave 2. </p>
              <p>And if you shorten to Jurong East Interchange, do you know how much inconvenience you will cause people? There is 99 to Jurong East. 185 is express to Clementi/Buona Vista. </p>
              <p>185 is doing fine. It has got fleet adds + many SD-&gt;DD upgrades in recent past.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, 506 should remain as it is as it provides connections between Bedok and Upper East Coast, otherwise, I think a new service should be introduced between Bedok - Upper East Coast if 506 is to be shortened or ammended.</p>

              <p>In fact, SBST's full-day express services (502, 506, 518) each provide unique connections and are nowadays often used by people who do not even need to hit the express sectors... I have observed 502 full of students in Jurong West and they're obviously not going to Orchard.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of adjusting fare calculations for such express services - basically, only charge express fares if one travels across the express sector. Normal trunk fares should still apply for those who are not, to fully utilise their intra-town and inter-town connections.</p>

              <p>I was thinking maybe they can also boost the frequency of express services and charge fares similar to Express 521 (now Trunk 963) where peak hour charges higher fares, but instead, <strong>only</strong> for travelling between Orchard/CBD/Marina Bay and Jurong/Pasir Ris and Tampines for 502 and 518 respectively and travelling on PIE for 506.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, as an alternative of boosting frequency, every alternate bus of 502 and 518 loops at Jurong East/Tampines respectively, increasing the number of total buses deployed, for 506, demand pattern is more complicated so maybe 2 buses can run the Bedok - Upper East Coast sector for full day and maybe 1-2 buses for JE - Bukit Batok during peak hours</p>

              <p>Maybe just convert it to a full day operational service.. Then fares will be the same like Svc 400/401/402/403... Trunk Fares.</p>

              <p>In fact, SBST's full-day express services (502, 506, 518) each
              provide unique connections and are nowadays often used by people
              who do not even need to hit the express sectors... I have observed
              502 full of students in Jurong West and they're obviously not going
              to Orchard.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of adjusting fare calculations for such express
              services - basically, only charge express fares if one travels
              across the express sector. Normal trunk fares should still apply
              for those who are not, to fully utilise their intra-town and
              inter-town connections.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In this case, the fares would be of the Nite Owl fares where they are calculated within towns for fare stage 1 &amp; 2 and full fare for fare stage 3 if they are travelling beyond towns...</p>
