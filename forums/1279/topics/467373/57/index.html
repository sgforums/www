(especially PM peak) 242 loading from BNL starting from 5:30pm to around 7pm (sometimes 5pm already have people queueing for the next bus) can hit around 55-65 per bus, maybe 242 should get 1 SD to DD fleet upgrade for the weekday PM peak crowd heading back to St72/71 and Ave 4/5</p>

              <p>5 SD (full KUB fleet), 2 DD (3121R crossover to 179/A in the morning), the DDs operate only on S shift to cater to the high demand during peak hours as people travel to and from their houses, 242 has the tendancy to bunch very frequently at the looping point (even during off-peak) due to the number of buses deployed.</p>

              <p>Neither, not even close to Pioneer. I gave up all hope when I knew who is going to take over the bus services next month. That was the time I knew it's time to get a driving license or walk.</p>

              <p>By the way, sgbuses, is your HQ somewhere near Pioneer Mall?

                                                  boon lay sec, jurong west sec, etcetera?) If your HQ is indeed at
                                                  Pioneer Mall (while BS HQ is indeed at Pioneer MRT), then why you
                                                  never fight for the people taking buses at Jurong West Avenue 4,
                                                  and why that BS group never fight for the people taking buses at
                                                  Pioneer MRT Station (e.g. ask LTA to bring the blk 651 bus stop

                                                  do to help the community, yet you all instead keep engaging in

              <p>Actually, it depends. I will look into the suggestion/request made and review the related data (e.g. bus loading) to see if it is really the case.</p> 
              <p>If it is really the case, I will accept it and work on it.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I will reject him in a kind manner. I would explain to him why his suggestions are not feasible.</p>
              <p>If this person keeps making the same suggestion/request even after I reject it, it is considered harassment/nuisance.</p>
              <p>If this is at personal level, I can apply for protection from that person, as he is harassing me.</p>
              <p>If this is at organisation level, I can ban him from commenting and block his emails from coming in.</p>
              <p>Simple.</p>

                  <p>From the way you write, you probably live somewhere along one/some of the bus routes in the Bulim GCM.</p>
                  <p>During the transition period, there will inevitably be some hiccups, due to reasons like bus drivers forgetting that they need to report to the new depot, new operator never fully anticipate daily bus operations, etcetera.</p>
                  <p>The good news is that not all the bus routes in the areas of concern are in the Bulim GCM. There's bus routes like 187, 157, 174 and 180, which will not be affected in this transition. :)</p>
                  <p>In view of the possible hiccups during transition period, it would be good if they can implement the transition only during the June and December school holidays, to minimise the inconvenience caused.</p>
              
              <p>Meanwhile, Bukit Batok SMC having By-Election. If they are smart, they would implement the transition for Bukit Batok bus services at a date that is after the election. Otherwise, it is very dangerous.</p>
