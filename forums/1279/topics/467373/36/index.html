              <p>That doesn't really help then... SMRT needs to beef up capacity
              of its feeders/intra-towns. If the A24s are merely for one-to-one
              replacement, then all the feeder/intra-towns are never going to get
              more high capacity buses.</p>
              <p>Even after launching DDs... if you see the number of bendies
              have reduced even on critical services like 300... 300 which was a
              full bendy service got fleet adds of only SDs and today you have
              4-5 SDs on this service daily... its pathetic IMO.</p>

              <p>They can temp use 188,190 &amp; 963 bendies if more DDs deployed on those service..If really Budep awarded to them then you start seeing more buses registered</p>

              <p>That's why using DDs solely is still the most desirable solution
              for space-crunch Singapore, even if it has its disadvantages when
              deployed on short trunk and feeder routes like sv300. Encouraging

              <p>103 these days already gets packed at Jalan Kayu.. in a few months, I suspect LTA will introduce 103M to loop around Jalan Kayu from Serangoon.. and also deploy DDs.. as the load has increased almost by double in the last 2 years. </p>

              <p>For ex: E500s that do 850E crossover to 969. SDs on CT18 crossover to sv 228. Buses on 196e do a full route of 196 before doing 196e.</p>

              <p>Tbh what 45 needs are more split buses during peak hours.. Deploying more dds might not be very effective because it's the bad frequency that causes the crashloads. During peak hours i can see 3 53s before 1 45 coming.</p>

              <p>For Sv 359, the only portion where I think could be a problem is PSR Dr 1 turning into PSR St 51. There isn't much leeway on the left side of the bus when turning. <br><br>They managed to put DDs back then with the 2-axle Atlanteens and VO2xs though. So, I think that the extra length of current DDs is the problem for that junction.</p>
              <p>For Sv 358, I actually think the minibuses are working quite well at the moment though. Granted that it's smaller than the other PPSS buses. But, at least I don't see empty 358P buses on the return trip. Haha. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I posted this some time before... It was built a few months ago, but I think they're waiting for the widened sector of Tampines Ave 5 to open. Also I saw some small-scale construction opposite this bus stop, and I guess it may be another bus stop as well.</p>

              <p>The Minister is farting.... (Pang pui in hokkien)</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The drop in energy prices seen in 2014 could translate to a reduction in public transport fares in the next fare review exercise at the end of the year.</p>
              <p>Based on available data for 2014, the fare adjustment could be "in the region of negative one per cent", said Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew in Parliament on Monday (Jan 19),<strong> </strong>in response to a question on the fall in oil prices.</p>
              <p>MP Gan Thiam Poh had asked, with regard to the ongoing 2014 fare review exercise, whether the Public Transport Council would consider a reduction of transport fares, as a result of the fall in oil prices since June 2014.</p>
              <p>However, Mr Lui noted that the ongoing fare review exercise, which started in November 2014, looks at changes in indices for 2013.</p>
              <p>"We will have to leave it to the Public Transport Council to assess the public transport operators' applications for fare increase, the fare adjustment quantum as given by the formula and the affordability of public transport for Singaporeans, amongst other things, and decide on the fare adjustment," the minister said.</p>
              <p>The fare formula is pegged to changes in the core consumer price index, wage index and energy index over the preceding year. This reflects the operating cost structure of public transport operators, said Mr Lui.</p>
              <p>The core consumer price index and wage index account for 40 per cent of the formula each. The energy index component, which accounts for energy and fuel costs, makes up 20 per cent.</p>
              <p>In the ongoing 2014 exercise, the value of the energy index component was negative 12.6 per cent - due to lower energy prices in 2013 - but the core consumer price index went up by 1.7 per cent, while the wage index saw an increase of 4.3 per cent.</p>
              <p>The fare adjustment quantum yielded by the formula would have been negative 0.6 per cent for the 2014 fare review exercise. However, the previous fare review exercise had announced a fare increase of 6.6 per cent in two steps.</p>
              <p>A 3.2 per cent hike was introduced in April last year, with the 3.4 per cent increase to be carried over to the ongoing review. Mr Lui explained that is why there is a 2.8 per cent fare adjustment quantum for the ongoing fare review exercise.</p>
              <p>The next fare review exercise is set to take place towards the end of 2015 and is based on data for the full year of 2014.</p>

              <p>This minister also <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pang pui</span></strong></span>. This has been practice all the while. Sleeping minister</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Bus drivers will be directed to take a different route if they are likely to experience a delay due to an accident, for instance, along the route they are on. This new practice will be adopted in Singapore as part of a move to improve bus punctuality.</p>
              <p>At the heart of it all is a command centre which will be set up to allow the authorities and public transport operators to predict and react more quickly to road situations. Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said the practice of redirecting bus routes has been in place in London and proven to be effective. But she added that for the system to work in Singapore, it is crucial that commuters are understanding and cooperative.</p>
              <p>There are about 600,000 cars on our roads. With 1.2 million households in Singapore, this means half of them own cars. Ms Teo said the figure is one of the highest for cities worldwide. She hopes the global positioning system will provide timely information to motorists on the road and suggest alternative routes so that drivers can detour to avoid congestion.</p>
              <p>Ms Teo said: "In the future, before we leave the house, the new system is able to suggest three options. For example, you can take this route - it'll tell you how much it costs and how long is the estimated time for travel. And if you don't take the first route, you may take the second. The distance might be longer but it might also cost you less, even though your travel time is slightly longer. Then you make a choice as to which route you will take."</p>
