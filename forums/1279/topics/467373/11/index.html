              <p>Sorry bro. I might have to correct you here.</p>
              <p>222 and 225 situation is completely different from 119. 119 is more BSEP / politically driven. 222 and 225 actually need the DDs. It is very well utilized.</p>
              <p>If you are interested I can share the loading for both these:</p>
              <p>225G / 225W: If you ever go to Bedok Interchange between 17.00 and 19.00 pm, you will see a huge queue for both these services. Now, I have this weird fascination for counting pax. Each bus on 225G takes more than 70 pax during this time. So the 2 DDs really come handy in taking the additional pax (of course opposite direction, the loading is 20 pax but does it really matter for a route with loop having around 5 km run).</p>
              <p>225G loading &gt;&gt; 225W. For 225W, you will see each bus having 60-70 pax, so the DD here could be questioned, nevertheless it has a healthy loading. Especially in morning peak the DD on 225W is very well used.</p>

              <p>Speaking about 222.</p>
              <p>I don't know when you saw this bus upper deck empty, but morning peak the loading is heavy between Bedok North Road and Bedok MRT and again at Bedok MRT to Chai Chee Industrial Estate (100-120 pax).</p>
              <p>Evening peak:</p>
              <p>Same thing. From Chai Chee, the evening peak DDs will take more than 100 pax and at Bedok MRT, you will see around 80 of these 100 pax alighting. At the same time you will see another 60-70 pax boarding the bus at this stop itself.</p>
              <p>If you observe 222 at Bedok Int, you will hardly ever see the bus with 20-30 pax because that is not the high loading point for 222, and you also have sv 14 from there.</p>

              <p>Can SBS deploy DDs on 101 on trial? Noticed lately the loading
              has been very high in evening peak at HG MRT. Citaros are not able
              to take load. Either need fleet add or best to have 2 DDs
              deployed. </p>
              <p>The only problem is the sv has poor loading between HG and
              Serangoon. Maybe a 101A between HG MRT and Buangkok Link can do the
              trick.</p>

              <p>Agreed that it could be the rain, but a small correction: Neither 116 nor 72 ply HG Ave 8. Did you mean HG Ave 4?</p>
              <p>For HG Ave 8, people do have the option of taking 161 from the interchange. 325 should be diverted to Kovan MRT rather than coming back to HG Interchange - does not really make sense.</p>

              <p>Sorry bro. I might have to correct you here.</p>
              <p>222 and 225 situation is completely different from 119. 119 is
              more BSEP / politically driven. 222 and 225 actually need the DDs.
              It is very well utilized.</p>
              <p>If you are interested I can share the loading for both
              these:</p>
              <p>225G / 225W: If you ever go to Bedok Interchange between 17.00
              and 19.00 pm, you will see a huge queue for both these services.
              Now, I have this weird fascination for counting pax. Each bus on
              225G takes more than 70 pax during this time. So the 2 DDs really
              come handy in taking the additional pax (of course opposite
              direction, the loading is 20 pax but does it really matter for a
              route with loop having around 5 km run).</p>
              <p>225G loading &gt;&gt; 225W. For 225W, you will see each bus
              having 60-70 pax, so the DD here could be questioned, nevertheless
              it has a healthy loading. Especially in morning peak the DD on 225W
              is very well used.</p>
