              <p>Yup, I think 979 need some DDs to run at night too. 11pm also got packed bus. There was once SMB5901C ran on AP slot, i think it did well. I happened to board it at night and it managed to pick up all the pax at Bukit Panjang, with 10-15standing pax, fully seated.. </p>

              <p>Haha and its ironic where GA appointed some office personnel to take the Class 4 course and Omnibus VL too.So not enough BCs those chaps all will come out drive half way ah?There is pros and cons too.I really pity those ex-SBST,SMRTB,SATS or Dnata bus drivers who only got 4A compared to those first batch class 3 which get their class 4 for free courtesy of the company.</p>

              <p>I think service standards will drop after the initial fanfare. Perth's GCM model is <a href="https://audit.wa.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1997-Insert-BusReform.pdf">designed mainly to cut cost</a>.</p>
              <p>If you provide no incentive in the contract to pick up passengers and 
                                              penalize operators for being late, funny things will happen (as it did 
                                              in Perth). It makes the former practice of "fan pai" look pale by comparison. PTA WA/Transperth took more than two decades to try and correct that problem and they still can't straighten things out because the contracts are for 10 years (i.e. breeds complacency).</p>
              <p>But that's no longer my problem. Singaporeans get the government they deserve.</p>

              <p>I doubt there is that much differentation to begin with. Even GA uses the same "welcome to XX" EDS as TT on the recruitment buses, down to the same font and size.</p>
              <p>Transperth has even made its bus operators standardize the EDS format. If Transperth is already doing that, then I am expecting the same level of micro-management to occur here. As such, any substantial initiative would have to come from LTA.</p>
