They could not be “cannibalised for spare parts” because the buses RapidKL now uses are of a different make. <br><br>But to say that all the buses could no longer be used does not make sense. <br><br>“The lifespan of a bus can be more than 15 years, depending on its maintenance. Since Intrakota was established in 1994, the buses could well have been roadworthy when they were dumped at the two sites two years ago,” said a source familiar with the issue. <br><br>The Intrakota buses were built by Iveco of Italy, while the present batch in use are mostly Mercedes-Benz, priced at RM350,000 or even lower as they were purchased in bulk. <br><br>RapidKL was set up in 2004 as a merger of Putra LRT, Star LRT, Intrakota and City Liner in an effort to give the Klang Valley an integrated transport <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.ktmrailwayfan.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2997#"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 11px; color: blue! important; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; position: relative;">system</span></span></a>. <br><br>The company then decided to purchase brand new buses for easy maintenance. <br><br>A check at the Sungai Buaya site revealed there were about 800 buses parked on what used to be a football field. <br><br>Located close to a housing area, the buses are watched over by a lone guard, who stations himself in a cabin, and is aided by several stray dogs. <br><br>The buses, many of them showing signs of decay inside and outside, are parked on a hilltop and hidden by trees and shrubs. <br><br>At Antara Gapi in Batang Kali, the 200-odd buses are parked in an open space by the main road, also guarded by a lone <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.ktmrailwayfan.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2997#"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 11px; color: blue! important; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; position: relative;">security </span><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 11px; color: blue! important; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; position: relative;">guard</span></span></a>. <br><br>It is learnt that the buses will be disposed of by tender, a process that is expected to take several months. The buses will either be sold as scrap or to Third World countries that can “rehabilitate” them. <br><br>Both RapidKL and SPNB were not available for comment.</p>

              <p>The pschology of a traditional Malaysian bus company (especially those Chinese ones) is:</p>
              <p>If the OFs, Hinos and goodness knows what in Malaysia are running, why replace them when they are working fine. They are cheap to maintain, have longer usuable lifespan and not a lot of people in the kampungs or small towns are complaining about them.</p>
              <p>Particularly when those Turbocities they dumped are probably the worst of their batch</p>
              <p>Question is, are there SL252s or O.405s inside?</p>

              <p>I agree with Superbus. I mean, as much as you would like to sell, there's nothing much you can do if there's no one to buy. It is sad but scrapping might be the best option in view of the high price in scrap metal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe the problem for the TurboCity is the availibilty of spares and they are not as widespread in Malaysia as MAN. Some ex-Cityliner/Intrakota MANs have been sold to Central Pahang and Town Bus of Melaka. There could be some MANs in the lot but they might stand a better chance of being sold. As for O405, I don't think Intrakota/Cityliner have any. The only ones I've seen are from Transitlink JB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for 'why replace them when they are working fine?', this reminds me of a particular Chinese bus company in Melaka. I believe this company enjoys a big profit from running a cross-border service which seems to be always full of people. But they are among the last when it comes to new buses. Their express buses are much to be desired. They may have 1 or 2 new buses now but it came eons after other companies have upgraded theirs. Their old express buses are put into service for their domestic routes and they will continue to run for another 10 years (maybe more) or until the bus collapses, whichever comes first.</p>

              <p>I agree with Superbus. I mean, as much as you would like to
              sell, there's nothing much you can do if there's no one to buy. It
              is sad but scrapping might be the best option in view of the high
              price in scrap metal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe the problem for the TurboCity is the availibilty of spares
              and they are not as widespread in Malaysia as MAN. Some
              ex-Cityliner/Intrakota MANs have been sold to Central Pahang and
              Town Bus of Melaka. There could be some MANs in the lot but they
              might stand a better chance of being sold. As for O405, I don't
              think Intrakota/Cityliner have any. The only ones I've seen are
              from Transitlink JB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for 'why replace them when they are working
              fine?', this reminds me of a particular Chinese bus
              company in Melaka. I believe this company enjoys a big profit from
              running a cross-border service which seems to be always full of
              people. But they are among the last when it comes to new buses.
              Their express buses are much to be desired. They may have 1 or 2
              new buses now but it came eons after other companies have upgraded
              theirs. Their old express buses are put into service for their
              domestic routes and they will continue to run for another 10 years
              (maybe more) or until the bus collapses, whichever comes
              first.</p>

              <p>I think its a lie they can't cannibalise the parts. i'm sure its doable. run the (what?) 700 ITC there n have 100 are cannibalised bus used for spare parts pool lah. 9assuming them 800 bbuses are ITC...)<br><br>same for the dear MANs. they (were) are lovely.</p>

              <p>Not all Ivecos are dumped. Many are still in working as Tempatan or "Local/Feeder" services.</p>
              <p>In fact, on my recent trip to KL on Labour Day, I got the rare chance to witness the first 'unveiling' of a refurbished Turbocity, one of the only 5 units re-fitted with the Dong Feng front. 'Chio' combo worrr!</p>
