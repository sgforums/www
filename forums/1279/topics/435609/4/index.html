              <p>i was hoping that one of 81 or 82 would be extended to cover the

              <p>Get this, I also have my demand, you've your demand, so now, how
              to balance everyone's need? Defintely bus - bus system is one
              way.</p>
              <p>Elderly is another issue, but take a look at the usual
              Singaporeans behaviour. I surveyed Pioneer station for quite some
              time, even some thoughts turns out to be true.</p>
              <p>It's not demeaning, for there's lots of unacceptable behaviour
              i.e. not moving to upper deck. Now you deprive others of a boarding
              chance, complain what? The world dun go around yourself, it evolves
              with everyone.</p>
              <p>If I can walk under the hot sun, I've never complained knowing
              there's no way every single bus sv can suit me.</p>
              <p>As for feeders, wasn't there 241? Furthermore, it's becoming
              clear as the new town develops further and how lopsided it is
              located for the BIs say Sengkang, feeder/ trunk concept would
              slowly kick in. Then what about the last MRT train?</p>
              <p>Things dun stick with no new feeders or whatever forever, it's
              how it evolves for the better of everyone's overall travelling
              needs.</p>

              <p>The amendment of Service 105 doesn't affect me as much as you like it to be. The effect is there, but negligible.</p>
              <p>Does it bite you that I want to fight for the convenience of Serangoon residents?</p>
              <p>Your survey of Pioneer station doesn't mean anything. It's just a small sample and not representative of the situation of Singapore. Besides who gave you the authority to make claims that cannot substantiated?</p>
              <p>If you want to walk under the sun and rain or snow for what matter, that's you. Why must you force everybody to be like you? Talk about the world revolving around me, you are  the one who thinks the world revolves around you.</p>
              <p>And you conveniently push the issue of the needs of the elderly aside? How clever!</p>
              <p>The issue 105 is not asking for new connections but to preserve existing connections.</p>

              <p>First thing, like I've said, does it mean for the sake of a long dist route making 1 squarish round around the Town Centre? Didn't the feeder bus concept appeared because of this? Why are we rewinding what was done?</p>
              <p>Obvious things aren't consistent all these years, but does it mean we keep on continuing to it?</p>
              <p>Students? Dun they can take 109, alight at last bus stop and walk into school along Ave 3? Yah, it means gotta leave 1x bus trip earlier.</p>

              <p>Can't really quantify the human traffic between TPY and Bounday/Serangoon in terms of numbers, but I'm not pleased with the 105 amendment either. In the immediate Sgn Ave 4 / Boundary Rd vicinity, the people have lost a direct link to Toa Payoh and Orchard. Not to mention the people who stay along YCK who do not have 73 to TPY nor a direct service to Scotts/Orchard too.</p>

              <p>Why are you ranting incessantly about how sucky (&amp; empty) 241A is or about the elderly? They are irrelevant to 105's scenario here. I repeat, THEY ARE IRRELEVANT - so stop your senseless spamming / tenuous linkings here.</p>
              <p>Jamming and packing the bus stop doesn't apply here because those stops along Boundary Road / Serangoon Ave 2 that 105 will not ply are not susceptible to such jams.</p>
              <p>Yes, we have to strike a balance. But where is the balance? Often, the balance is not as clear as it seems. For every link that is lost, commuters are subjected to more inconvenience. However it is not fair to judge 105's balance based on YOUR preferences/personal habits.</p>
              <p>You say you've taken a number of trips. That sounds so dubious. I've taken dozens of trips having stayed in the vicinity for so long - and no, I don't observe what you've observed! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>So, let me ask you - if you're residing around Sgn Ave 4, Sgn Central Drive (Blks 257, etc), YCK area, Serangoon, and you need to go to Toa Payoh/Orchard, what's the bus you'll take? 105!</p>

              <p>Indeed, I was surprised at the loss of Sv 105 for Boundary Rd residents. Not forgetting the hordes of people who board the bus at Blk 238 headed out of S'goon in the morning, these people are not going to be pleased.</p>
                  
                  <p>The pax onboard leaving this stop can easily hit 35 per trip, and the bus comes anywhere between 8 to 11 minutes during peak hours, so that means we have about 210 residents making a detour to S'goon Int every hour during peak periods just to transfer to Sv 105. For day off-peak periods, it can be as high as about 150 every hour as there is a constant stream of people who go to Orchard or Toa Payoh for transfers throughout the day.</p>
                  
                  <p>Forcing them to take Sv 73 is not the best solution because, based on observation, headway is rather erratic during peak periods and every trip can see pax onboard of 50. Add 35 people in for every trip and the loading hits 97%.</p>

              <p>You're really itching for an argument.</p>
              <p>Don't get me started on the circuitous routing out of interchanges. Since we're at amending 105, let's cut the Toh Guan Rd sector since it's making one whole big loop before it gets to Boon Lay Way, since 52 duplicates it all the way to Clementi.</p>
              <p>How about Svc 54 which makes one big circuitous routing in Bishan.</p>
              <p>Let's cut Svc 55/58 too so they can follow 53 route into the interchange.</p>
              <p>Better still cut parts of Svc 8, 28, 39 route.</p>
              <p>Also cut 133, 136, why go one big round when they can use AMK Ave 8 instead.</p>
              <p>Let's also cut 74. 147, it can follow 132/165's route instead. Isn't that faster?</p>
              <p>Then replace all these deleted sectors with feeder services.</p>
              <p>Svc 325 also makes a circuitous journey out of Hougang Central.</p>

              <p><br>I won't say heavy traffic, but there's traffic nonetheless. Generally people in Serangoon Avenue 4, those living along Boundary Road and Block 210/209 in Serangoon Central would still be affected nonetheless.</p>
              <p>It is possible to take a bus and transfer to 73, but 73 has erratic schedules. I rely on this service quite often. It's not so much about the bus fare, but really the extra time spent commuting.</p>
