              <p>controlled by shareholder and not govt? so you want e govt to manage everything {later ppl say we're a nanny state bla bla bla} or you want initiative?</p>

              <p><br> Do you want to be treated like a secondary school kid in the
              polytechnic when you are not even wearing a uniform? Or do you want
              to be treated like a young adult?</p>
              <p>Before I raise the points on why the polytechnics are considered
              tertiary institutions and hence charge tertiary fare, let me rebutt
              your points first.</p>
              <p>The fact is the JCs are under the MOE. The polytechnics are
              under the Stat Board of the government. Naturally JC education is
              cheaper than a polytechnic. If you feel that poor/low
              income families cannot make it to the polytechnic, you are
              totally wrong.</p>
              <p>There are tuition grants and subsidies that are provided by
              Merdaki, CDAC and CPF just to name a few. Since they
              are gov stat board that's why CPF can be used.</p>
              <p>The payroll of the JC teachers and principal are under the MOE.
              The polytechnic lecturers are under the payroll of the polytechnic
              itself. As a stat board the government would not give full
              financial assistance to the polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Transportation wise - NP is the least accessible of the 5
              polytechnics. And given its popularity and student population, it
              has students from around the island. The NP Student Union is
              proactive to get ComDel to have shuttle services to their campus.
              In contrast, TP also have shuttle services from Bedok and Tampines
              MRT to its campus.</p>
              <p>NYP SP and RP.. no need to say.. They have a nearby MRT
              station.</p>
              <p>Now for my argument: Do you want to be treated like some kids in
              a secondary school, or young adults getting ready for the working
              world?</p>
              <p>Look are the JCs and ITEs - yes they pay secondary school fares
              and concessions. Look at how education is taught through them? Look
              at the cert they receive after they complete their education
              there?</p>
              <p>JCs have lectures, and tutorials. ITEs have lectures, tutorials
              and workshops. JC gives you the A level cert which in the
              working world its almost as good as an O level cert. ITEs give you
              the NITEC or the Higher NITEC certification. This cert is good
              enough for them to go into the working world, or if their
              results are good enough, to the polytechnic. I'll stop about
              the ITEs here as I do not have a full picture on their education
              system.</p>
              <p>The JC has a discipline system. You are not allowed to skip
              class (though you may AWOL yourself), cannot leave school before
              lunch, or even do certain things that you think you may be able to
              do in the JC. It is practically compulsary to join a CCA as well.
              You cant even plan your own timetable! You still need to run if you
              are overweight! Things there are rigid and regulation to
              certain extents. Tell me where is the difference between the
              JC and secondary school in this aspect?</p>
              <p>Look at the Polys and Unis - they pay tertiary fares and
              concessions, adult fares if not on concession. They graduate with a
              Diploma/Degree and above.</p>
              <p>It is not compulsary to join a CCA. It is not compulsary to
              attend any events though they dangle CCA points as a carrot
              sometimes. You may skip class as and when you want (except polys
              and some uni modules which have attendance requirements). Your
              timetable is planned by yourself (except some polys). Your classes
              doesnt start at 8am or 9am (except RP at 8.30am) - you may start as
              early as 8am, finish as early as 11am, start as late as 2pm, or you
              dont even have to go to school for that day!</p>
              <p>Polys and Unis do not follow the MOE Academic Calender.
              They can set their own exam papers. They do not take other
              schools' exam papers for the students to practice which pri, sec
              and JCs are fond of doing. They use their own past year papers.</p>
              <p>Diplomas and Degrees are recognised in the working world. That's
              partly because you had hands-on experience in the course of your
              field. In addition, a Diploma grad commands a higher starting pay
              than an A level graduate. So what do you think?</p>
              <p>Both the polys and unis are structured in that manner.
              Henceforth they are called <strong>TERTIARY
              INSTITUTIONS.</strong></p>
              <p>10 years later I will still see this petition. The people who
              created this petition do not get the rationale behind the bus fares
              between JC and Poly students. Its not about the similarities in
              age. Its about the <strong>EDUCATION</strong> you are
              receiving.</p>
