              <p>I think the Public Transport Council needs to consider Poly Students fare to be reduced. This is pretty unfair in my opinion as JC students enjoys 45 cents flat fare whereas poly students suffer with adult fares</p>

              <p>What's more, entering a JC is more cheaper than entering a Poly. This really scares off students from poorer, low income families to go into Poly. This 'unfair fare system' for Poly Students is really an additional 'headache' to them. It's time the Polytechnics do something for the justice of their students. Luckily, some polys have already provided shuttle service like Ngee Ann Poly providing free shuttle service in the morning from Woodlands, Clementi and Hougang.</p>

              <p><br>Do you want to be treated like a secondary school kid in the polytechnic when you are not even wearing a uniform? Or do you want to be treated like a young adult?</p>
              <p>Before I raise the points on why the polytechnics are considered tertiary institutions and hence charge tertiary fare, let me rebutt your points first.</p>
              <p>The fact is the JCs are under the MOE. The polytechnics are under the Stat Board of the government. Naturally JC education is cheaper than a polytechnic. If you feel that poor/low income families cannot make it to the polytechnic, you are totally wrong.</p>
              <p>There are tuition grants and subsidies that are provided by Merdaki, CDAC and CPF just to name a few. Since they are gov stat board that's why CPF can be used.</p>
              <p>The payroll of the JC teachers and principal are under the MOE. The polytechnic lecturers are under the payroll of the polytechnic itself. As a stat board the government would not give full financial assistance to the polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Transportation wise - NP is the least accessible of the 5 polytechnics. And given its popularity and student population, it has students from around the island. The NP Student Union is proactive to get ComDel to have shuttle services to their campus. In contrast, TP also have shuttle services from Bedok and Tampines MRT to its campus.</p>
              <p>NYP SP and RP.. no need to say.. They have a nearby MRT station.</p>
              <p>Now for my argument: Do you want to be treated like some kids in a secondary school, or young adults getting ready for the working world?</p>
              <p>Look are the JCs and ITEs - yes they pay secondary school fares and concessions. Look at how education is taught through them? Look at the cert they receive after they complete their education there?</p>
              <p>JCs have lectures, and tutorials. ITEs have lectures, tutorials and workshops. JC gives you the A level cert which in the working world its almost as good as an O level cert. ITEs give you the NITEC or the Higher NITEC certification. This cert is good enough for them to go into the working world, or if their results are good enough, to the polytechnic. I'll stop about the ITEs here as I do not have a full picture on their education system.</p>
              <p>The JC has a discipline system. You are not allowed to skip class (though you may AWOL yourself), cannot leave school before lunch, or even do certain things that you think you may be able to do in the JC. It is practically compulsary to join a CCA as well. You cant even plan your own timetable! You still need to run if you are overweight! Things there are rigid and regulation to certain extents. Tell me where is the difference between the JC and secondary school in this aspect?</p>
              <p>Look at the Polys and Unis - they pay tertiary fares and concessions, adult fares if not on concession. They graduate with a Diploma/Degree and above.</p>
              <p>It is not compulsary to join a CCA. It is not compulsary to attend any events though they dangle CCA points as a carrot sometimes. You may skip class as and when you want (except polys and some uni modules which have attendance requirements). Your timetable is planned by yourself (except some polys). Your classes doesnt start at 8am or 9am (except RP at 8.30am) - you may start as early as 8am, finish as early as 11am, start as late as 2pm, or you dont even have to go to school for that day!</p>
              <p>Polys and Unis do not follow the MOE Academic Calender. They can set their own exam papers. They do not take other schools' exam papers for the students to practice which pri, sec and JCs are fond of doing. They use their own past year papers.</p>
              <p>Diplomas and Degrees are recognised in the working world. That's partly because you had hands-on experience in the course of your field. In addition, a Diploma grad commands a higher starting pay than an A level graduate. So what do you think?</p>
              <p>Both the polys and unis are structured in that manner. Henceforth they are called <strong>TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS.</strong></p>
              <p>10 years later I will still see this petition. The people who created this petition do not get the rationale behind the bus fares between JC and Poly students. Its not about the similarities in age. Its about the <strong>EDUCATION </strong>you are receiving.</p>

              <p>question is who's going to absorb the extra costs for granting more travel concessions to poly students? definitely not the transport operators as they are doing a business and is already currently absorbing so much concessions to a significant percentage of the commuters. They are also not welfare organisations!</p>
              <p>Pass on the costs to full-fare paying passengers?  then the middle class will suffer; esp those who do not qualify for transport vouchers but earn little salaries which i believe form a large bulk of the population.</p>
              <p>or how about impose additional taxes on car owners and these collections be channeled to absorb public transport concessions, keep fares low and affordable, improve our public transport system?</p>

              <p>And then, if lets say you nvr take from them, in the future you own a car.. govt tax you for the same reason.. Will you be happy?</p>
