              <p>I have to agree his points as there are quite a huge number of
              poly students and this may cause the bus company to earn less but
              looking from the report for the year 2007, SBS Transit and SMRT
              made a profit of $50 million and $135.8 million, respectively after
              taxes which I think is quite a huge sum of money. If they are
              willing to do that, they can focus on other areas to earn more $$
              like what is SMRT doing, building shops at MRT station but still
              not compromising on serving bus commuters and service
              standards.<br> I think it is impossible for the both companies to be
              nationalised by the government. Even though this may mean that with
              under the government control, they may improve greatly on the
              management of public transport. Fixing on prices, which may adverse
              effect on what is happening to country like Malaysia now. This may
              cause to be more dependent on the government. So balanced is
              needed.</p>

              <p>If the bus companies are being nationalised, we could only expect the company to perform even worst than what we are experiencing now. They will not have the motivation to strive to work harder to serve the communters. We have very good examples from US and Aust.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I find it unfair. As a poly students, we pay quite a sum to school every semester. But for a JC students, their school fees are cheaper and transport fees are cheaper. Does that mean poly students are made used to make money? It is not very fair if the answer is YES.</p>

              <p>What's more, entering a JC is more cheaper than entering a Poly.
              This really scares off students from poorer, low income
              families to go into Poly. This 'unfair fare system' for Poly
              Students is really an additional 'headache' to them. It's time the
              Polytechnics do something for the justice of their students.</p>

              <p>Please use ur pea brain to think before you post...</p>
              <p>1) Entering JC =/= cheaper than poly, some JCs do charge approximately same rate as some polys</p>
              <p>2) There is something called financial aid. Unless you are so rich(with your branded accessories) not to know about what is going on..</p>
              <p>3) The decision is with PTC and the govt, there isnt really much the polys could do..</p>

              <p><br>I hope you plan in getting into JC because of your ability and not because of cheaper bus fares.</p>
              <p>A few more points to add on after some of your replied.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>One of you said cheaper concession fares. <strong>MAY</strong> be feasible but I believe $52 and $45 bucks arrived after some calculations by the price fixers.</p>
              <p>Just look at these few students:<br>An SP student living in Pasir Ris<br>An NP student living at Upp East Coast<br>An NYP student living at Jurong West St 92<br>A TP student living in Choa Chu Kang<br>An RP student living at Holland Village</p>
              <p>yes i'm taking the extremes of each poly vs residential area.</p>
              <p>A sane person (less bus enthusiasts of course) would buy the $45 TCP. Some may buy $52 depending on whether they have a direct bus to school. Since poly students pay adult fares, use that as the benchmark. Assuming 22 weekdays in a month, no going out on weekends and elsewhere before/after school, you would see that the 45/52 bucks is justified. Its even more justified to buy concession when transport fares are rising.</p>
              <p>Dont believe me do some calculations yourself. For those currently in poly, calculate your costs and see if your concession is justified.</p>
              <p>I do understand that JC students are at the better end of this because some of them would go lengths to get into the JC they want - say living at Woodlands and studying at VJC. Their 45 cents is worth the money. However, consider this, many parents send them to school. Costing wise here is rather vague.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Another one of you said its not easy to work and study at the same time. I agree. Working part time and studying full time is better than working full time and studying part time. All it takes here is time management.</p>
              <p>I do have friends who work regularly every weekend (less exam period) during their poly days. During holidays they request to work on weekdays subject to manpower requirements. A handful of them work during the computer shows every quarter. Though its a 4 day hectic job but the commission you made from that seems worth (or maybe not worth) it.</p>
              <p>The bottom line is simply time management and self discipline. There are more girls who work part time than guys. There seems to be a trend for this.</p>

              <p>Well... I want you to know that in my argument, I am not saying that the poly cannot have the same fares as JC students. If the petition were to be successful, I will be very happy as well. Who don't want cheaper fares?</p>
              <p>But, in my opinion, I feel that the govt might not take the petition too seriously, especially in the current financial crisis, because asking for at least 50% reduction of fares at once for the entire cohort of poly students might be too bitter a pill for them to swallow. Hence, they might need a lot of time to consider this plan. Hence, I suggested that while the relevant authorities debate on this issue, why not set up a "cheaper concession pass scheme" catered just for poly students at the moment so that poly students can enjoy? The drop might not be big.... but hey.... since when do adult fares dropped?</p>
              <p>The govt may have lots of funds now, as we all know, but I suppose they are taking a very cautious approach to spending them. Hence, I am not against the petition. We can all try and hope for the best... but just be prepared for the worst case scenario...</p>
              <p>As for the comparison analogy, I understand your rebuttal. But, that'd based on observations that I know of. People who can afford high-end products doesn't neccesarily have to accept higher fares but reality checks show that while they might complain about increments in simple fare like books, meals and fares, such sales expensive branded stuff still remain strong and most of the sales are attributed to an increasing number of youngsters nowadays. It isn't uncommon that outsiders, like me, might link those "fruits" together.</p>
              <p>Hence, I am trying to be impartial and if the petiton works out fine.. that's good. If not, perhaps my suggestion is worth some seconds of attention? Hehe... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
