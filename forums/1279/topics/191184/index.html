            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Woodsville Interchange to be upgraded with road tunnels, flyover</strong><br><br><span class="small">17 May 2006 1625 hrs (SST) 0825 hrs (GMT)<br><br>SINGAPORE : It is one of Singapore's most congested interchanges linking four major roads.<br><br>Woodsville Interchange is reaching its full capacity usage and is already starting to cause massive traffic jams.<br><br>So the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has stepped in with a multi-million project to build three new tunnels and a flyover to manage the growing traffic.<br><br>Construction is expected to be completed in 2011.<br><br>It has become a common sight - trapped in bumper to bumper traffic near the Woodsville Interchange.<br><br>Traffic studies by the LTA have shown that it is not unusual to wait for 2 to 3 traffic light cycles to clear the junctions at Serangoon, Upper Serangoon, MacPherson and Bendemeer Roads.<br><br>That means about 7 minutes stuck in traffic, plus 3 more minutes if you take the U-turn at Whampoa North.<br><br>Based on computer simulations, the proposed upgrade will cut travelling time by half, taking into account the projected traffic growth going through the area.<br><br>With the three new tunnels, traffic on Serangoon to Upper Serangoon, Bendemeer to Upper Serangoon and MacPherson to Bendemeer Roads will also be uninterrupted, while a new flyover will link the PIE slip road to Kallang Way.<br><br>Currently during peak hours, traffic flows at Woodsville Interchange is up to 8,400 vehicles per hour.<br><br>LTA says if nothing is done, it will be gridlock in a few years time. But with the upgrade, the new interchange will have increased capacity of 11,000 vehicles per hour during the peak periods.<br><br>A single tunnel and flyover project completed elsewhere in Singapore already costs $20 million to $30 million dollars, and a project of this size could cost several times more.<br><br>LTA says it will likely be the most expensive project of its kind, and one of the most complex road structure projects to date.<br><br>"To compound the situation, we have the NE Line MRT tunnel which runs along the Serangoon Upper, Serangoon corridor, as well as deep sewage tunnels which run parallel to the PIE. So that means when we come up with a system that requires us to build tunnels and flyovers at that junction, we have to make sure that we don't affect any of the infrastructures in place," said Paul Fok, director and chief engineer (civil) at LTA.<br><br>Surrounding buildings like Jackson Centre will be affected by the road widening and some portions of the former Serangoon Fire Station will have to be torn down.<br><br>Before construction starts in late 2007, a six month study will be done to evaluate the best construction method.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></div>

In order to manage the increased traffic demand over the years, Woodsville Interchange was upgraded in 1994. The upgrading involved the conversion of the dual two-lane flyover into a four-lane flyover to cater to the east-bound traffic and the construction of another four-lane flyover to cater to the west-bound traffic. A flyover to cater to the traffic heading towards Central Expressway (CTE) was also included in the upgrading.</div>
