            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose things have gotten worse. The new management has went all the way to cut costs, eliminating unnecessary staff. A driver told me that even those conductors who keep track of bus timings are terminated, leaving the entire timing integrity to the computers. Break times reduced to squeeze bus captains dry. Cleanliness compromised; look at the interior nowadays. Dirt everywhere.<br><br>If things go on this way, I rather SMRT Buses merge with SBS Transit.</div>
