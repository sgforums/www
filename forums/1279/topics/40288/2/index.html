Low floor buses are needed on this route because a lot of old folks travel on this bus . Let's see what happens later .<br>As for bus 28 , the VSO on bus 28 are permenent , i dont think they are short of the buses but at the same time , i doubt they have many spare buses .</div>

However, I do agree with what one of them had said about Svc 88. It passes many residential areas and there would be lots of old folks in most of the estates, therefore low floor buses like VSOs should be deployed on them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that Sv. 88 passes by many mature estates, but the 96xx VOs were placed on Sv. 88 at the same time the service was launched in 2000. Reason being the 96xx VOs were built in 1999 and only deployed in 2000.<br><br>Sv. 28 doesn't have spare buses, now it needs even more buses due to the route extension. Even if Sv. 88 has VSOs I suspect it would be the SBS 9835 - SBS 9849 buses.</div>
