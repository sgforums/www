BC went down to check if there were further damage to the bus. Several Passengers, including (a bus driver learning 113's route seated behind) were shocked as the crash was really loud. The lorry sped off, i think he is trying to flee the accident scene. The BC continued its trip after picking up mirror and put it behind his seat. He had to turn his head around several times at bus stops to check if there is still anyone alighting from the bus exit door. BC did not report this matter to OCC so i think he might return bus to depot and take another bus out.</p></div>

                              <p>SBS5013G on 113 crashed into a lorry at hougang ave 2 turn
              junction towards kovan station and it's left wing mirror fell off.
              BC went down to check if there were further damage to the bus.
              Several Passengers, including (a bus driver learning 113's route
              seated behind) were shocked as the crash was really loud. The lorry
              sped off, i think he is trying to flee the accident scene. The BC
              continued its trip after picking up mirror and put it behind his
              seat. He had to turn his head around several times at bus stops to
              check if there is still anyone alighting from the bus exit door. BC
              did not report this matter to OCC so i think he might return bus to
              depot and take another bus out.</p>
