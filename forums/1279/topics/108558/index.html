Seconds later, Mr Tann heard a 'very loud' bang.<br><br>According to eyewitnesses, after the bus left its lane, the cyclists were forced to slow down and shift further to the left.<br><br>Another member of the group said: 'Some (cyclists) were squeezed onto the grass patch... we were forced to bunch up together.'<br><br>Some cyclists shouted at the driver to slow down, but in vain.<br><br>The bus hit Mr Ang and dragged him for about 7m as it swerved back into its lane and stopped.<br><br>According to the cyclists, Mr Ang's pelvic and left thigh region was stuck under the wheel of the bus.<br><br>Said one of them, who declined to be named: 'His helmet was in pieces and his left leg was totally smashed. One of the riders who attended to him was a plastic surgeon. He told us not to touch his body.'<br><br>Right after the accident, the bus driver was seen shaking his head and making calls on his cellphone. None of the passengers, believed to be tourists, got off the bus, said the cyclists.<br><br>Together with the police, the SCDF arrived about 15 minutes later and rescued Mr Ang, using airbags to jack up the bus, said an SCDF spokesman.<br><br>Mr Ang is now in intensive care. He is believed to have suffered severe head trauma, punctured lungs and multiple fractures to his lower limbs.<br><br>The bus driver is now assisting police in investigations.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Ang's family and friends are keeping vigil at his ward.<br><br>Said one of his cycling mates: 'When we train together, he never gives up. Even when he is falling behind, he keeps pedalling, and the next thing you know, he is beside you again. But this must be the hardest race of his life.'<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>This is the bad sheep of the herd!!<br><br>Well, I'm a cyclist myself holding class 3/2/2A/2B license.  These SBS &amp; Translink island buses often cut dangerously close beside me while overtaking &amp; i was force close to the kerbs.<br><br>Do drivers often think that cyclist are always travelling so slow that they get impatient &amp; risk ppl's life by reacting to it in a hostile manner?<br><br>Do drivers ever think of the consequences &amp; if the cyclist is their son or daughter? Would they want the same thing to happen to them on the road?<br><br>I'm really sadden when i heard of this incidents &amp; read it in new today.<br><br>Aint SG a graces country? Why ppl are behaving in this manner on road?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Seeing the Fatal Road Accident signboard of the TP, the imagination of his gruelsome death runs in my mind. Being the emotional type I turn teary when looking at the leftover long swerving tire marking &amp; the blood stain on the road.<br><br>I hope that i wont hear news of another fellow cyclist die in such horrified &amp; unjustical way under somebody's hand whereby he still left with many undone on earth.<br><br>During the ride on Sunday something ease my mind, is the forgiving good clearance space of gaps the bus have given me. Probably because the road is less busy &amp; there's more space for lane changing.  Inside my heart I appreciate the patient &amp; thoughtfulness of these drivers.</div>
