              <p>In Estate A, there were many feeders. Two of which were svc B
              and svc C. They where merged together to form a Townlink svc D.
              However, later on, Townlink svc D was merged with another feeder
              from a seperate estate and extended to Estate E as Trunk Svc F.</p>
