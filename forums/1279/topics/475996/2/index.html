              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Like Iâll say.. and people like negotiable are just making
              attacksâ¦</p>
              <p>Iâll repeat this.. Dun stalk and attack on peopleâ¦ Dun want to
              reply dun bother typing</p>
              <p>1) If the <span>MRT</span> breaks down at Joo Koon,
              leaving with <span>EWL</span> trains turning around at
              Boon Layâ¦ May I know whatâs the contingency plan? How are
              passengers going to be quickly dispersed out of the congested
              Pioneer Stn bus stop?</p>
              <p>Say people anti <span>SMRT</span> this and that, then
              when <span>MRT</span> breakdownâ¦ Maybe the next thing go
              and ask why no shuttle bus, how come not enough bus to clear the
              crowdâ¦</p>
              <p>negotiable can suggest something? Since you think Iâm talking
              with no logic?</p>
              <p>2) The incident where the BC took no heed to wait for the
              alighting paxâ¦ The BC still has the right to scold passengers for
              not alighting quickly.</p>
              <p>Made matters worst, all the buses were operated as 179â¦ Many of
              the buses fly stop at 27231 and 27251 except for alighting.</p>
              <p>Do people know how <span>SLBP</span> timekeeper used to
              make people squeeze on 179A during AM peak ops? Squeeze until the
              exit door of LO3x has problem closing! People even had problems
              alighting as there was people with no choice standing on the
              staircase leading to the upper deck.</p>
              <p>3) <span>S241 BC</span> flouting traffic rule,
              <span>S179 BC</span> stopping at 27211âs zig zag line
              whenever <span>S179A</span> is not operated, buses
              alighting pax at Pioneer Stn by parking along the road beside the
              <span>S179</span> buses inside the bus stop bayâ¦ All these
              are condoned?</p>
              <p>4) <span>S179A</span> is not profitable. Chickenlittle2
              is eating his own words. Many of the overoperated <span>S179</span> are not even taking in pax into <span>NTU</span> with 10% loading factor. Why Iâm saying 10% is
              because of the lossesâ¦</p>
              <p>The <span>S179</span> bus is incurring runtime into
              <span>NTU</span> and yet it only collects some $0.80 â $2â¦
              Can this cover the additional time incurred in relation to manpower
              cost?</p>
              <p>Chickenlittle2 is better off working in the <span>NTUC</span> Fairprice. Because hearsay is that <span>NTUC</span> realised by running 24 hrs itâs not able to cover
              the additional cost [additional revenue cannot cover the cost
              incurred to run 24 hrs]... Since chickenlittle2 know how to defend,
              I think <span>NTUC</span> or Sheng Siong would like him,
              with knowing how to come with pattern to increase revenue at all
              cost..</p>
              <p>5) Overops issue and anti <span>SMRT</span>â¦ Obviously
              negotiable is condoning illegal bus ops just for the purpose to say
              Iâm anti <span>SMRT</span>â¦</p>
              <p>If the bus get into accident, how to report the bus duty code?
              and made worst, many of these buses the BC does not even have the
              way bill with them onboard!</p>
              <p>and say I anti <span>SMRT</span> for not letting them
              to earn the revenue? I think negotiable is now attacking
              <span>LTA</span> then since it was their stipulated
              arrangementâ¦</p>
              <p>Furthermore, I didnât know negotiable is ok if his own bus sv he
              takes is underoperated just because ops staff say loading not high
              enoughâ¦</p>
              <p>Want to attack, better know what the matter is all aboutâ¦</p>
              <p>anyway.. if the matter goes to the media, see what happensâ¦ like
              <span>S190</span> caseâ¦ buses not properly operated..</p>
              <p>Want to flame on people, dun end up eating your own words just
              to find it fun to attack on peopleâ¦</p>
              </div>

              <p>Rename 179A to 179 as full fledged service and operate full day. Truncate 179 to Pioneer MRT and rename as 179A peak hour SWT. Problem solved for you.</p>

                                  <p>Like IÃ¢â¬â¢ll say.. and people like negotiable are just making
                  attacksÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>IÃ¢â¬â¢ll repeat this.. Dun stalk and attack on peopleÃ¢â¬Â¦ Dun want to
                  reply dun bother typing</p>
                  <p>1) If the <span class="">MRT</span> breaks down at Joo Koon,
                  leaving with <span class="">EWL</span> trains turning around at
                  Boon LayÃ¢â¬Â¦ May I know whatÃ¢â¬â¢s the contingency plan? How are
                  passengers going to be quickly dispersed out of the congested
                  Pioneer Stn bus stop?</p>
                  <p>Say people anti <span class="">SMRT</span> this and that, then
                  when <span class="">MRT</span> breakdownÃ¢â¬Â¦ Maybe the next thing go
                  and ask why no shuttle bus, how come not enough bus to clear the
                  crowdÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>negotiable can suggest something? Since you think IÃ¢â¬â¢m talking
                  with no logic?</p>
                  <p>2) The incident where the BC took no heed to wait for the
                  alighting paxÃ¢â¬Â¦ The BC still has the right to scold passengers for
                  not alighting quickly.</p>
                  <p>Made matters worst, all the buses were operated as 179Ã¢â¬Â¦ Many of
                  the buses fly stop at 27231 and 27251 except for alighting.</p>
                  <p>Do people know how <span class="">SLBP</span> timekeeper used to
                  make people squeeze on 179A during AM peak ops? Squeeze until the
                  exit door of LO3x has problem closing! People even had problems
                  alighting as there was people with no choice standing on the
                  staircase leading to the upper deck.</p>
                  <p>3) <span class="">S241 BC</span> flouting traffic rule,
                  <span class="">S179 BC</span> stopping at 27211Ã¢â¬â¢s zig zag line
                  whenever <span class="">S179A</span> is not operated, buses
                  alighting pax at Pioneer Stn by parking along the road beside the
                  <span class="">S179</span> buses inside the bus stop bayÃ¢â¬Â¦ All these
                  are condoned?</p>
                  <p>4) <span class="">S179A</span> is not profitable. Chickenlittle2
                  is eating his own words. Many of the overoperated <span class="">S179</span> are not even taking in pax into <span class="">NTU</span> with 10% loading factor. Why IÃ¢â¬â¢m saying 10% is
                  because of the lossesÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>The <span class="">S179</span> bus is incurring runtime into
                  <span class="">NTU</span> and yet it only collects some $0.80 Ã¢â¬â $2Ã¢â¬Â¦
                  Can this cover the additional time incurred in relation to manpower
                  cost?</p>
                  <p>Chickenlittle2 is better off working in the <span class="">NTUC</span> Fairprice. Because hearsay is that <span class="">NTUC</span> realised by running 24 hrs itÃ¢â¬â¢s not able to cover
                  the additional cost [additional revenue cannot cover the cost
                  incurred to run 24 hrs]... Since chickenlittle2 know how to defend,
                  I think <span class="">NTUC</span> or Sheng Siong would like him,
                  with knowing how to come with pattern to increase revenue at all
                  cost..</p>
                  <p>5) Overops issue and anti <span class="">SMRT</span>Ã¢â¬Â¦ Obviously
                  negotiable is condoning illegal bus ops just for the purpose to say
                  IÃ¢â¬â¢m anti <span class="">SMRT</span>Ã¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>If the bus get into accident, how to report the bus duty code?
                  and made worst, many of these buses the BC does not even have the
                  way bill with them onboard!</p>
                  <p>and say I anti <span class="">SMRT</span> for not letting them
                  to earn the revenue? I think negotiable is now attacking
                  <span class="">LTA</span> then since it was their stipulated
                  arrangementÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t know negotiable is ok if his own bus sv he
                  takes is underoperated just because ops staff say loading not high
                  enoughÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>Want to attack, better know what the matter is all aboutÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>
                  <p>anyway.. if the matter goes to the media, see what happensÃ¢â¬Â¦ like
                  <span class="">S190</span> caseÃ¢â¬Â¦ buses not properly operated..</p>
                  <p>Want to flame on people, dun end up eating your own words just
                  to find it fun to attack on peopleÃ¢â¬Â¦</p>

                              </blockquote><br>
                  You are such a hard commuter to please, and mind you, you don't pay more for transport than for most of your other expenses, and Singapore has a very low fare for its standards of service. So really, you are getting a bargain for what the operators are earning (or as your first post in this thread, losing).<br>
                  <br>
                  1) Not sure where MRT breakdown fits into this discussion, but if you are talking about 179 acting as a shuttle bus, I don't see how SBS should be responsible in providing extra buses to clear the crowds at Pioneer, the only thing they are required to do as a bus operator running services in the region is to let passengers on for free.<br>
                  <br>
                  And if you are talking about the shuttle buses, please understand that when the breakdown occurs, there is a chain of events that need to occur before the buses get activated, and even so, it takes time for the buses to get down, and that is provided you have no jams along the way. I believe LTA, which has a control centre (shown in the news during the December 2011 breakdown), should respond first by sending their contracted traffic officers down as an interim measure.<br>
                  <br>
                  2) Do you think timekeepers want their passengers to suffer? They are just doing their job, unfortunately you chose to see issues which they have to mitigate as the fault of the timekeepers/bus operators. Issues such as a jam in Boon Lay Interchange (which in turn are infrastructural issues which the various authorities had a say in), or late running due to traffic conditions along the way, or even a bus which had unfortunately broke down.<br>
                  <br>
                  3) If you see any vehicles flouting traffic rules, report it to the relevant authorities, do you think airing it here would help? <br>
                  Also, a bus is there to perform downroute on a normal 179 and is early for the trip, and you complain about it. Do you prefer buses not running at all? What is so special about 179A which you have to take it no matter what? Why don't you suggest to your school to allocate lots or build a bus terminal in the campus which will ensure safer operating conditions and more reliable operations?<br>
                  <br>
                  4) So if you think 179 is unprofitable, 179A would be profitable? I do not have any exact data regarding passenger numbers and revenue collected, but clearly, operating 179A trips as 179 isn't going to be a big issue as it brings you to the same place just a few minutes slower? Again, why do you have to take 179A instead of a normal 179? You are lucky to have 179A operating as a normal fare route, instead of something similar to 74e and 151e serving institutions such as NP, SIM, SP and NUS charging express fares.<br>
                  <br>
                  5) SMRT has explained the issues regarding that night when the 190 video was taken. In summary, trips were not operated due to the breakdown of ONE bus and a traffic jam on PIE, given that the fastest non revenue route which buses have to take from CCK to the city is through PIE, they would have been affected by it, together with the buses which are in service. The whole 190 issue stems out from a lack of proper planning and infrastructure upgrades by the government, and a government which has neglected buses ever since they have gone for the rail option. The corridor where 190 serves would had been better operated as an advanced and separate transit system.<br>
                  <br>
                  Back to 179, as I said before, since LTA has not issued any fines for 179 for not meeting QOS standards, it would be safe to say that 179 has been operating within QOS standards, which simply throws your arguments about 179 out of the picture. Do you not trust LTA's figures? Even if certain trips are not running due to unforeseen circumstances, the timekeeper has obviously done his job in improving the situation by adjusting the timings of the trips, otherwise QOS may not have been met.<br>
                  <br>
                  Once again, you have shown that your understanding of bus operations is lacking, so instead of making a fool out of your comments, why not toughen up, keep quiet and board buses like all other passengers do. If you think you can run a bus company, or be part of it, kindly set up your own company or join the bus companies. Otherwise, cease your rants and reflect on your online behaviour.<br>

              No, run 179A as an express variant, since it skips stops like all the express variants of full fledged routes. The best thing is full fare passengers wouldn't have to subsidise concession holders in this case.

              <p><br>Thanks bro for highlighting this. You are the 4th user over here who is sharing the same perspective. 179A loading is not as high as it is made out to be bcoz anyone taking MRT will take 179 to Pioneer unless needs to transfer to another bus in Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>Even those who have to go to within Jurong East will transfer on Pioneer North to 185/192/193/243G/W as it will be faster to reach their destination than going all the way to Boon Lay Int and then transfering to one of these services.</p>
