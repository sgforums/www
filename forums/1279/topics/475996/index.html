              Well, if 179 doesn't come out on the list of routes which didn't meet the stipulated QOS, then I reckon you should stop the self centric rants. Other people have it worse than NTU students.

              <p>Such a huge difference between SBST and SMRT losses. Seems like SBST with having 70% of the bus services is doing way better. Though the business is not profitable, there is at least hope.</p>
              <p>With SMRT, they just have to go shut shop because they have proved to be inefficient in every way that is making them incur such huge losses.</p>

              Not about the frequency... It's how they dispatch the bus...

              <p>Please stop behaving like a selfish bastard here and expect everything to go your way. Stop whining like a 3-year-old kid, accept it that's life and that's how SBST keeps its bus ops alive.</p>
              <p>If you want your dear 179A to operate properly then complain to SBST lah! If cannot complain to LTA, Translink and plead them to fit it in BSEP just to suit your petty life lah! After all you are so good in complaining here what! With your bloody statistics and all!</p>

              Like I'll say.. and people like negotiable are just making attacks...
              
              I'll repeat this.. Dun stalk and attack on people... Dun want to reply dun bother typing
              
              1) If the MRT breaks down at Joo Koon, leaving with EWL trains turning around at Boon Lay... May I know what's the contingency plan? How are passengers going to be quickly dispersed out of the congested Pioneer Stn bus stop?
              
              Say people anti SMRT this and that, then when MRT breakdown... Maybe the next thing go and ask why no shuttle bus, how come not enough bus to clear the crowd...
              
              negotiable can suggest something? Since you think I'm talking with no logic?
              
              2) The incident where the BC took no heed to wait for the alighting pax... The BC still has the right to scold passengers for not alighting quickly.
              
              Made matters worst, all the buses were operated as 179... Many of the buses fly stop at 27231 and 27251 except for alighting.
              
              Do people know how SLBP timekeeper used to make people squeeze on 179A during AM peak ops? Squeeze until the exit door of LO3x has problem closing! People even had problems alighting as there was people with no choice standing on the staircase leading to the upper deck.
              
              3) S241 BC flouting traffic rule, S179 BC stopping at 27211's zig zag line whenever S179A is not operated, buses alighting pax at Pioneer Stn by parking along the road beside the S179 buses inside the bus stop bay... All these are condoned? 
              
              4) S179A is not profitable. Chickenlittle2 is eating his own words. Many of the overoperated S179 are not even taking in pax into NTU with 10% loading factor. Why I'm saying 10% is because of the losses...
              
              The S179 bus is incurring runtime into NTU and yet it only collects some $0.80 - $2... Can this cover the additional time incurred in relation to manpower cost? 
              
              Chickenlittle2 is better off working in the NTUC Fairprice. Because hearsay is that NTUC realised by running 24 hrs it's not able to cover the additional cost [additional revenue cannot cover the cost incurred to run 24 hrs]... Since chickenlittle2 know how to defend, I think NTUC or Sheng Siong would like him, with knowing how to come with pattern to increase revenue at all cost..
              
              5) Overops issue and anti SMRT... Obviously negotiable is condoning illegal bus ops just for the purpose to say I'm anti SMRT...
              
              If the bus get into accident, how to report the bus duty code? and made worst, many of these buses the BC does not even have the way bill with them onboard!
              
              and say I anti SMRT for not letting them to earn the revenue? I think negotiable is now attacking LTA then since it was their stipulated arrangement...
              
              Furthermore, I didn't know negotiable is ok if his own bus sv he takes is underoperated just because ops staff say loading not high enough...
              
              Want to attack, better know what the matter is all about...
              
              anyway.. if the matter goes to the media, see what happens... like S190 case... buses not properly operated..
              
              Want to flame on people, dun end up eating your own words just to find it fun to attack on people...
