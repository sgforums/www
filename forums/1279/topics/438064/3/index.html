              <p>A PIW in bedok reservoir complain about 2 consec mk 4 on 21 but not 59 with full scania (on weekends even if not weekdays). Why? It's simply becos he needs the 21 but for the 'theoretically perfect" 59 <em>there's no opinions not becos it's full WAB, but maybe cos he don't rely on it.</em></p>
              <p>Sometimes it's just a matter of which service, timing piw appear and the available bus at that time. It's sometimes a matter of chance, say in front of parkway parade a piw who's going Serangoon North might be infuriated with seeing 2 consec LO3 76. But during that time, 2 VO3 consec on 196 might get away with it if there's no PIW along the full trip of the buses. On the other hand, he wouldn't appreciate it even if u were to say 36 is all WAB since he doesn't need it! </p>
              <p>The moral is like supermarket groceries: U have a risk of stocks running low and not fulfilling demand, but so long as u don't stock out when a customer needs them, u're safe. But then, even if u have abundance of stocks but no demand, they will put to rot in store also no use. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p>Of course there's plenty of WAB services in Bedok Reservoir &amp; Marine Parade, but what SMB128B talking now is Sengkang Anchorvale/ Fernvale, where only a pathetic 163 running, where it's not even WAB, which making it inconvenience for PIW staying around there. Even when there're more than half of the fleets are KUBs on 163, his mum can't board bcos it's still not PIW accessible.</p>
              <p>So should this one and only stock in this supermarket be always stock up for this case? How would you know it's not in demand? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Of course we are just the minority which can't decide which services are in demand of WAB, and also not many PIW taking those WAB either. But if you put yourself in their shoe, you will understand their frustration. Some PIWs are not rich, but they still need to travel around, with the simplicity of buses and MRT, as it cost lesser than taking cabs.</p>
