              there is a reason why some buses have more wab buses. for 113 for instance,
              everyday got at least 2-3 piws taking the bus.

              <p><br>what the cock are you tokking about?? It is inevitable that there will be be the oddball running around. We can't have all WEGs and Citaros/KUBs running because 51 has about 30 buses running at any one time. The dispatchers are already trying their best to get new buses on any route they can best deploy the resource.</p>

              <p>I seriously wonder why some bus fans need wheelchair buses around? Personally, are you suffering from any disability that requires the use of a wheelchair?</p>
              <p>Do you know how many wheelchair pax use our buses everyday? Do you know how wheelchair bus routes are determined? The bus companies know these as they talk to VWOs regarding this, and so they have every reason to put or not put wheelchair buses on routes.</p>

              <p>Look, there's a min quota for WAB buses per service. It's abt 60%</p>
              <p>Right now the priority is to get as many svs to go WAB as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>If the remaining 40% has to be MKIII so be it.</p>
              <p>Complain somemore, maybe give North East feeders VO2x... Got more seats what.</p>

              <p>The irony is when I ride on services like full WAB 136 i wonder how often PIW comes on board, where they board cos my experience of rides between Kovan to Sengkang i never see PIW on it before. </p>
              <p>So does the percent like 3/10 volvo buses in WAB services really kill? In this sense not necessary, so long as the slots are spaced out i.e not consec and maybe on partial day operations like S shift. Or maybe some day when we joyride on a Mk 4 slot for WAB services like 100 we see for ourselves whether there's PIW getting "pangseh" becos of the mk4 then we conclude this issue. </p>

              <p>When you are abled, you can take any buses as you can, even board the upper deck of a DD. But when you are disabled, you will understand their feeling. Even when WAB service is only 60% WAB, PIW still can't board when MKIV arrives, they have to wait till a WAB, and what if too full till they can't board, they have to wait till one WAB that they able to board. Whereas for us abled-being, we can "suka suka" still squeeze in till face sticking on the window and bus still can move off.</p>

              <p>A PIW in bedok reservoir complain about 2 consec mk 4 on 21 but not 59 with full scania (on weekends even if not weekdays). Why? It's simply becos he needs the 21 but for the 'theoretically perfect" 59 <em>there's no opinions not becos it's full WAB, but maybe cos he don't rely on it.</em></p>
              <p>Sometimes it's just a matter of which service, timing piw appear and the available bus at that time. It's sometimes a matter of chance, say in front of parkway parade a piw who's going Serangoon North might be infuriated with seeing 2 consec LO3 76. But during that time, 2 VO3 consec on 196 might get away with it if there's no PIW along the full trip of the buses. On the other hand, he wouldn't appreciate it even if u were to say 36 is all WAB since he doesn't need it! </p>
              <p>The moral is like supermarket groceries: U have a risk of stocks running low and not fulfilling demand, but so long as u don't stock out when a customer needs them, u're safe. But then, even if u have abundance of stocks but no demand, they will put to rot in store also no use. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
