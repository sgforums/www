              <p>It seems like there are quite a number of rumours that fly around every now and then across different threads, with anything from rumours of decomissioned buses being used for training purposes by the military to speculation of new bus routes, etc. I decided to start such a thread so that fellow forumers can post any bus rumours they may have heard and get it confrimed or debunked. Moderators might want to sticky this thread.</p>
              <p>Also guys, please: keep things civil, keep a cool head, and keep an open mind. There will sure be a lot of absurd claims running around here, but until it is confrimed or debunked by a reliable source, keep all possibilities open. Sometimes, the most absurd thing might turn out to be true, while something that sounds rather possible is actually a myth.</p>
              <p>And to begin, here are some rumours (a few old ones, and one recent one from another thread) that I have heard:</p>
              <p>1.</p>
              <p>Claim: a decomissioned Volvo B57 bus is stored inside Pasir Laba military camp for training purposes.</p>
              <p>Status: unconfrimed</p>
              <p>Sadly, there's no wasy way for anyone to either confrim or debunk this rumour. Pasir Laba Camp is a military installation and is hence off-limits to most people; even military personnel might not be able to confrim this as they may not have the chance to come across it (Pasir Laba Camp is an extremely large military installation). However, it might be possible to check with SBS Transit if they gave any buses to the military in the mid-1990s (around the time when the Volvo B57 was being withdrawn), though this query might come across to them as suspicious, as anything involving the military tend to be regarded as sensitive matters.</p>
              <p>2.</p>
              <p>A bendy bus was deployed on route 858 several years ago to test the viability of bendy buses on Changi Airport routes.</p>
              <p>Status: conflicting reports</p>
              <p>I have been rather confused by this one for some time. On one hand, I hear people saying this never happened, and on the other I hear that it did happen, but the bus was struck at Changi Airport. It is not clear if the bus was on-service or not, as this is one of the many conflicting details. Someone please clear the air once and for all.</p>
              <p>3.</p>
              <p>Air-conditioned buses were deployed on Jurong Industrial Services before all but two of them (routes 246 and 251) officially gained partial air-con status.</p>
              <p>Status: needs reliable backing</p>
              <p>This was from someone's personal accounts; a Volvo B10M MK IV deployed on one of the routes (route 252 if I remember) before it officially got air-conditioned buses. I heard about this before I went on my hiatus, and I remember everyone being very suspicious of the person who shared the account (can't remember who though). I never knew if someone ultimately backed it up with something reliable (bus captain accounts, etc.); can someone confrim this?</p>
              <p>4. The super-long Volvo B10M was deployed on a route other than route 62 recently (long after it's trial around various bus routes) - route 34 if I'm not wrong.</p>
              <p>Status: unconfrimed</p>
              <p>This was from someone's personal account (step forward please if you are the one who made this originally): Volvo B10M Superlong (SBS 997A) cameoing on a route other than 62, which it has struck to for a very long time - even before it was extended to Punggol but cut back to Geylang Lorong 1. This rumour was also from before I went on my hiatus, and no one believed that guy. I'm giving this rumour another chance to be reliabily confrimed or debunked.</p>

              <p><br>Certainly not true for the cameo on sv34 or whatever services. Even before the extension to Punggol, there is only one BC who is able to drive 997A. Until after the extension to Punggol, all S-shift BC learnt 997A which enable them to drive it.</p>
