            <div class='col-md body'>very good idea. Or should begin with a new route. If alternate 39 route, people will have a longer time to get to travel between Tampines and Yishun.

At the same time, 965 travel along WDL Ave 7 while 161 does not. There is some sort of competition for commuters who travel between Sengkang and Yishun, but overall, 965 is the only bus from WDL Ave 7 and Yishun to Sengkang and 161 is the only bus from HGN to WDL. They serve different market. As for 168-969, 969-39, I am not very sure about the route they take.</div>

Demand should be high as no buses in the serangoon, kovan and hougang could go to yishun.<br><br>A feeder bus should operate from Punggol Int to Punggol Road End as I often see empty buses from the punggol rd end to the NEL station so the freq could be put higher.</div></blockquote>What for? Sengkang Hougang are a few of the nearer Int to punggol.If you merge 82, might as well don't merge. You just amend 82 lah. But if it goes S'goon to pgl alone, might as well withdraw it as it duplicates a bit of NEL and somemore there's still alternative Bus services.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>82 HAve to stay.. afterall.. during school term.. alot of students uses 82 as their only mode of transport.. it is the only bus from Hougang to most of Punggol Rd at SengkAng Area.. alot of students uses it.. CHIJ,SRJC,NVSS,PPS and a few other schools.. so.. i dont think it is a good idea to do any changes to 82...</div>
