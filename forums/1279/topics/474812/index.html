              <p>They said, in order to persuade car owners to give up car ownership, they must make their PT convincing and efficient. </p>
              <p>However, I understand that the reason people want to own a car is to so that they can drive around to places PT cannot easily reach. And also due to the lack of MRT stations at some estates and the limited choices of slow and long-winded bus routes to the city. </p>
              <p>LTA has done efforts such as introducing new svcs to improve connectivity and CityDirect svcs too. But why are most people still refusing to give up driving?</p>
              <p>Here's what I think LTA can try:</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">1. Introduce express svcs on buses. That means, buses that run limited-stop services on current bus services. Eg. Svc 5 can have express svc 5X that skips some stops and head straight to the city, only stopping at some major stops. They can run full day, everyday on a perhaps hourly basis, allowing pax to have a choice to get faster rides. </span></p>
              <p>2. Since LTA has always looked towards HK's minibus system, I suggest POs invest their resources on the red-minibus system in HK instead of those Townlinks short trips which I can foresee little effect. The buses can lead to places that normal fixed routes cannot conveniently reach and that the buses can also link places which currently require several transfers to reach. </p>
              <p>3. Taxi system is a major catastrophe in Singapore. Limited number of cabs, picky drivers, and countless surcharges. How is the current drivers gonna get appealed to switch to taxis then? (I count taxis as PT since there will be much less taxis than cars) Maybe LTA can ask POs to reduce the surcharges and also put strict rules on driver's choice and shift changes etc. Increasing the number of taxis also allow people to get a cab quickly and also increases demand and competition between the drivers (this better service). </p>
              <p>As I have said, these are only me two cents. So pls don't take it too hard and do feel free to reply. Please also feel free to comment what are your suggestions. Thanks!!</p>

              <p>If they want to do, can do in many ways.</p>
              <p>1. Increase bus lanes everywhere so that traveling by bus is very fast option</p>
              <p>2. Add car usage surcharge even in non-CBD area, so when people want to take car compared to bus/MRT, have to think twice</p>
              <p>3. Make most bus fleets DD so that people can get comfortable journey and buses are not over-crowded</p>
              <p>4. Reach out to more HDBs and condos with unique routes</p>
              <p>5. Modify existing routes to provide more direct connections to places in shorter distance. Longer distance can change.</p>

              <p>I didn't want to initially join the conversation, but the post that mentioned lack of roads as the cause of congestion in Singapore is not only untrue, but actually dangerous if the general population has this mindset.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/07/09/137708751/more-roads-may-pave-way-to-more-traffic">Research</a> has shown that building more roads will actually lead to more traffic if there is no limit on car growth. <strong>Roads in Singapore already takes up 12% of our entire island, vs 14% for residential.</strong> Exactly <strong>how much more roads do you want</strong>?</p>
              <p>I don't want to compare, even though HK is also a high density city. The reason why we cannot compare is because of how geography of the two cities is widely different, take a look at the map and you will understand. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The highways in hk are also very direct, with very few exits, whilst sg works mainly on a <strong>grid system</strong> where main roads are criss crossing at any other opportunity with expressways and other main roads. <strong>HK has ~2000km of roads while SG has ~3400km</strong> as per data from CIA.</span></p>
              <p>The problem here (unfortunately) is <strong>the lack of control on car entitlements</strong>. The positions of the previous transport ministers was to allow people to own cars as they wish, but force them to pay for usage into the city or for any congestion caused using the ERP system. Obviously this stand has reversed with the current minister as it is not sustainable causing road rage, and frustrated drivers.</p>
              <p><strong>Once someone owns a car, and starts to reap the benefits of driving, do you think they will care about 1. Express buses, 2. Minibuses, 3. Taxi, 4. More bus lanes, 5. More DD, 6. More direct connections ??? None of this concerns them anymore!</strong></p>
              <p>You have just sold them a <strong>10 years permit to drive their cars</strong> around the island,<strong> why would they turn towards public transportation and park their cars at home to collect dust?</strong> It costs just a bit more to drive, especially since they paid for the car already, but the benefits are so much more. Asking them to give up driving their cars and use public transportation just because it's "better", will not work.</p>
              <p>This is why car ownership and growth will be capped in the following years to come, even though people are unhappy.</p>
              <p>But <strong>Improving public transport is still important</strong>, because eventually the <strong>goal is to make public transportation attractive enough so the people no longer thinks of wanting a car anymore</strong>.</p>
