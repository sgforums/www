              <p>Thing is, how much more road is needed. I don't see the need of any more roads now tbh. The thing we need now are those minibuses system that HK has to bring us into new housing estates which is kind of inaccessible.<br><br>Right, that might not make people switch from using a car to using public transport, but at least the convenience is there. I know the current bus network is quite good already compared to other south east asian countries, but there are always room for improvement.</p>

              <p>Lemme tell u something. </p>
              <p>HK roads are so well connected that most, MOST higher income ppl don't need the public transport. And the traffic condition don't really differ from SG. Though emission levels there have been horribly high. </p>
              <p>And if this is how you want to find fault with me, sure, with all your trolls and you can just go on listing things like Tsing Ma bridge and Lion's Mountain tunnel etc. </p>
              <p>I'm sorry but these are just my personal views. In terms of PT I liked SG one much more frankly. Well except for those pathetic three-car trains. </p>

              <p>Also how they came out with the route 120. If there is no demand, just close the route and moved on. no point wasting limited resources.</p>
              <p>Ppl staying in Bt Panjang will understand the frustration of taking 960, 190, 700 and 971E to town in the peak hours.

              <p>Dont blame the foreigners too. </p>
              <p>They came becoz we SGreans don't want to take up the labour jobs. Sweeping the streets or building at construction sites aren't what the present AND the future generations of SGreans expect themselves to do. Even bus driving is something no locals will dream for. So, the gov has no choice but to import all these ppl. To make sure we can even work in air-con offices comfortably. </p>

              <p>I think LTA needs re-organisation. </p>
              <p>They are not improving the current svcs in trouble, yet wasting their resources on things that basically serves no purpose. They dont want A24s for BSEP, YET they don't make SMRT introduce DDs, causing the residents there to have to stick to the squishy A22s. Svcs like 966 and 87 aren't even showing any improvements sometimes. And I agree on you for svc 120. </p>
              <p>I don't damn understand why LTA still likes 3-car trains to serve a line that stretches from east to west and YET expect people to give up their cars. Dont use the lame excuse of increasing freq, coz I can see Singapore can dream on running automatic frequency train systems (or whatever u call it), where shorts trains come every 2-3 mins full day. </p>
              <p>And how you expect the coastal suburbs residents to travel by PT to the city when the MRT station is so far away and the buses to the city are so long-winded? For example, svc 80 should just omit Kovan and Hougang, since the whole of that sector has at least 1 or 2 svcs covering the route ale. This would allow the Sengkang residents to have a faster ride to the city. Currently most depend on LRT then MRT, which is very inconvenient. </p>

              <p>Easy for you to say, why not put yourself in their position and give some suggestions on what you can do? Public transportation planning is an art, there are many ways to do it, and not all ways works as well. Every single thing that is needed, takes time and money to be built. And how do you know they dont want high capacity buses for BSEP? Buses dont magically get built, you know.</p>
              <p>The DTL has been in planning since 10 years ago. If you could predict the future it's easy to say we should get longer trains, but who could? Till now we do not even know what the loadings for DTL would be, especially since it is not meant to replace the trunk lines (EWL), but as a supplement and replacement for bus services. Every single decision needs justification. Even if there was enough load to put 4-car trains, how much more would building an additional 24m per station cost and how would it affect the frequency of the entire system?</p>
              <p>And so what is your stand exactly? In the opening post you have mentioned that improving connectivity is something LTA ought to do, but now you are saying that services implemented exactly for the reason should be removed? Svc 120 not only has bridged Alexendra area, but also partly stablised 195's frequency by sharing load. And that is what BSEP is meant for, improving connections and frequency where bus operators find it unprofitable to do so, paid for by the govt.</p>
              <p>Why not put down your hindsight and start asking questions on why are things being done this way for the future?</p>

              <p>I think BSEP has made visible improvements for SBST...especially the addition of the DDs.</p>
              <p>Can't say that for SMRT. Taking SMRT buses still remains a frustrating experience for many services. And since I started taking bus to Bkt Panjang, I can now experience for myself squeezing on 190 and 960. Not exactly a wonderful experience at all. Peak hr frequency is wonky and the buses have a tendency to crawl at peak hour, even with jam.</p>

              <p>There is also a need to take into factor the social symbol of a car. Ask any Singaporean girl what they look for in a boyfriend/husband. Car is probably one of the first answers. And they will want their boyfriend/husband to fetch them to and from work everyday.</p>
              <p>"Foreign
               talents" imported into Singapore include the rich as well. There is 
              very little the government can do to force them to take mass public 
              transport.</p>
              <p>There are only two ways to this problem. The first solution is to introduce an upmarket public transport for the rich to travel. New CBD express services specifically deal with this issue.</p>
              <p>The second solution is to take the convenience and time incentive of using a car away. Perth has a very interesting way of doing this. They set the freeway speed limit at 100km/h and allow congestion to form on freeways. Parallel to the freeway is a metro line that runs at 120km/h. When the rich starts to see trains zooming past them during peak hour, they might start thinking twice about public transport.</p>

              <p>How do you expect 80 to get to Aljunied from Sengkang without
                  going through HG and Kovan?</p>

              <p>I said AT LEAST 1-2 svcs. Which part do u not understand? Talking English don't understand, want Tamil? Salah my head loh. </p>
              <p>And yes, it can be done, KPE tunnel can fit DDs. Maybe can leave svc 80 as it is, but why not utilise KPE for the express I suggested in the opening post? Svc 80X? Just suggesting ah, use brain and read thx</p>

              <p>I generally agree with this, most developing MRT systems have
                  provision for expansion.</p>
              <p>However, I still like to bring up one small difference which
                  makes a difference which is the use of driverless trains.</p>
              <p>In normal human operated systems, adding more train sets would
                  also increase the costs of paying for operators, which adding train
                  cars (length) wont.</p>
              <p>But with the use of driverless systems, you could add new train
                  sets and no new operator is needed to drive those trains, therefore
                  not only increasing the capacity, but also the frequency of
                  services.</p>
              <p>There is of course a limit on how far this can go, but again,
                  not a trunk line, but a supplementary line to share load.</p>

              <p>I agree on CCL. But what about DTL? That one is exclusive trunk for BPJ and Changi residents eh. 3 car won't work in the long run. Take a look at Guangzhou Metro line 3. 3 car train operation initially with a 6 car train length station structure for all stations. A few years later the Panyu and Tianhe district underwent extensive development and oh god, you should have checked out the crushing load. In the end the trains ended up 3+3 to form 6 car trains and the freq reduced. So LTA could've built a little longer to wait for a while, after all the 6.9 million population is in the near future and more estates are springing from Bukit Timah and Bedok Reservior area. Don't forget the SUTD too.</p>
              <p>For the issue on increased freq, have you out into consideration of the how much signalling upgrades and system enhancements will take? Believe me it is easier to run 3 min 6-car trains than 2 min 3-car trains during peak. That's what NEL is good at. It also causes trains to occasionally go empty. </p>

              <p>Easy for you to say, why not put yourself in their position and
              give some suggestions on what you can do? Public transportation
              planning is an art, there are many ways to do it, and not all ways
              works as well. Every single thing that is needed, takes time and
              money to be built. And how do you know they dont want high capacity
              buses for BSEP? Buses dont magically get built, you know.</p>
              <p>The DTL has been in planning since 10 years ago. If you could
              predict the future it's easy to say we should get longer trains,
              but who could? Till now we do not even know what the loadings for
              DTL would be, especially since it is not meant to replace the trunk
              lines (EWL), but as a supplement and replacement for bus services.
              Every single decision needs justification. Even if there was enough
              load to put 4-car trains, how much more would building an
              additional 24m per station cost and how would it affect the
              frequency of the entire system?</p>
              <p>And so what is your stand exactly? In the opening post you have
              mentioned that improving connectivity is something LTA ought to do,
              but now you are saying that services implemented exactly for the
              reason should be removed? Svc 120 not only has bridged Alexendra
              area, but also partly stablised 195's frequency by sharing load.
              And that is what BSEP is meant for, improving connections and
              frequency where bus operators find it unprofitable to do so, paid
              for by the govt.</p>
              <p>Why not put down your hindsight and start asking questions on
              why are things being done this way for the future?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Of course it is easy. Mine are just suggestions, even I know they are unlikely to come true, though it would be great if they do. </p>
              <p>Please don't use infrastructure cost to compare since it takes much more to upgrade signalling and it also costs more to build bigger depots to store more trains. And also takes more men to tend to the increased number of trains. More short trains means more men assigned to tend to each train, and more train series to schedule too. So which cost more now?</p>
              <p>I'm sorry for contradicting myself for the part on svc 120. Indeed, my stand was in the opening post and it was a moment of confusion and ignorance to state as such. However I would like to say there are more possibilities than svc 120 that could've benefitted more ppl. This is a sweeping statement so I won't elaborate much. </p>

              <p><br>Well, I have graduated w/ MBA. I am in my mid-30s. I do live in a condo (have also stayed in HDB). I do have a car. This is in response to government wanting everyone to leave their cars home and take bus.</p>
              <p>I do that but so many of my neighbours in the condo take the car, coz they don't find it so expensive especially when they are not going CBD. So I know what I am saying, my friend.</p>
