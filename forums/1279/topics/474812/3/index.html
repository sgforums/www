              <p>Easy for you to say, why not put yourself in their position and give some suggestions on what you can do? Public transportation planning is an art, there are many ways to do it, and not all ways works as well. Every single thing that is needed, takes time and money to be built. And how do you know they dont want high capacity buses for BSEP? Buses dont magically get built, you know.</p>
              <p>The DTL has been in planning since 10 years ago. If you could predict the future it's easy to say we should get longer trains, but who could? Till now we do not even know what the loadings for DTL would be, especially since it is not meant to replace the trunk lines (EWL), but as a supplement and replacement for bus services. Every single decision needs justification. Even if there was enough load to put 4-car trains, how much more would building an additional 24m per station cost and how would it affect the frequency of the entire system?</p>
              <p>And so what is your stand exactly? In the opening post you have mentioned that improving connectivity is something LTA ought to do, but now you are saying that services implemented exactly for the reason should be removed? Svc 120 not only has bridged Alexendra area, but also partly stablised 195's frequency by sharing load. And that is what BSEP is meant for, improving connections and frequency where bus operators find it unprofitable to do so, paid for by the govt.</p>
              <p>Why not put down your hindsight and start asking questions on why are things being done this way for the future?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I more or less agree with most of your statements... just that on sv 120... it is a waste... it has not really helped share load of sv 195... they don't even have one stop in common on the TBL side... I don't know what you are referring to here... If you are saying at Tiong Bahru... their routes are completely different to and from TB... so again it does not help 195.</p>
              <p>Have u observed sv 120? What load sharing? If a bus does not have more than 10-15 pax most of the times, it helps in load sharing? Sv 120 routing is so bad that it is a waste of resources. LTA should fix this ASAP.</p>

              <p><br>Explain me HOW?</p>
              <p>51 goes via HG Ave 3 --&gt; Eunos to Geylang Road</p>
              <p>43 goes via YCK Rd --&gt; Serangoon Central to Upper Paya Lebar</p>
              <p>62 goes via HG Ave 3 --&gt; Ave 1 --&gt; Lor Ah Soo to UPL</p>
              <p>People living along Upper Serangoon Road in Hougang and Kovan have service to UPL / Geylang / Bugis? Have you seen the loading during AM peak from here to UPL / Geylang? Have you seen the loading during PM peak from Aljunied to Kovan?</p>
              <p>So many people take this bus. It is not for no reason that it has a fleet of 20 DDs. I don't know why would you want to change route of a popular service like 80? If route needs to be modified, it can be done for services like 113, 119, 325 in Kovan / Hougang area.</p>

              <p>This is exactly what HK did. However HK dual-operation only applies to cross-harbour routes, where there is a strict and clear boundary between KMB and NWST territory. If you look carefully the South TKO svcs or svcs 701/702 is not dual-controlled becoz of the confusion. The Victoria harbour basically just splits the controls very obviously. </p>
              <p>But in SG, there aren't fixed territories. The CBD svcs won't work since the area there is shared. Moreover LTA controls both operators while in HK the operators are private. So LTA may not approve dual control as it may mess up the fare structure and fund division. </p>
