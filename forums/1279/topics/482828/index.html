              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, smrt withdrew the services for the various HDB towns to city. They still have the city back to HDB towns direction but shortened the timing. People can still take the services back home from city. Of course, most are definitely out for entertainment so no issues to take the buses home. For those who worked at odd hours, most employers will definitely reimburse those workers who take cab. There are seldom people taking from HDB towns to city direction so it is good decision to withdraw. No point to conpare with other cities as demand in Singapore is weak. Totally nothing to do with showing compassion and coming down from ivory tower!</p>

              <p>To further add on, midnight buses are not part of any basic essential services which public bus operators must provide. They are considered premium so it is definitely ok to withdraw according to demand as it is basically a case of demand and supply. This will definitely not apply for those basic bus services which are not allowed to just anyhow change. Thanks. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>dd77, from your reply, it shows how myopic your points ah, but getting employers to reimburse workers on shift work is already adding to the costs and sometimes workers are not compensated at all as the job is chosen by them , the employer will just ask them to take it or leave it.<br><br>Fyi, before concessions for the elderly kick in, ie travel at concessionary rates start at 0630hrs, SCs pay full fare for services when they start work at 0630 hours or earlier, eg cleaners, food stall holders and other jobs...<br>Did the employer re-imburse them?! NO<br><br>So your logic does not hold any truth, please lah dun b the gahmen's mouthpiece, you are defending government's policy even though it is flawed.<br><br>You mean to say that if its not feaible and not part of basic bus services, it should not be provided at all?! What flawed logic is tt?!<br><br>Is that how the PAP government think?!<br><br>Thank God other countries transport people do not think like tt or else night shift workers will be sleeping till the 1st bus/train comes<br><br>Have you worked in establishments that have odd hours? <br>Obviously, if you work in gahmen organisation, ah gong will allow you to claim taxi as it is not often. the folks who use night services are working at odd hours daily, if not only during weekends/PHs... if you did not, have not and not about to, please "forever hold your peace", you reply and type without thinking about the plight of others...<br><br>Singapore want to be a cosmopolitan society dun even have proper basic buses catering for service jobs that run funny hours...<br><br>Please lah, free, no need to go far, fly to HK go have a look see</p></div>

              <p>taxis are expensive. a trip between Yishun and Sembawang cost $5. add in all the surcharges, NR are cheaper in a sense. the SBST Nite Owls takes it even cheaper, within town at a fraction.</p>
              <p>night buses should be a supplement to most of the day buses, and it is considered as Basic service not Basic+ nor premium.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, each of us has our own views in this forum, be it nice opinions or not far-fetching as what you want. But bear in mind just to back-up your views with suggestions or evidence. Do not go launch any personal attacks on people. The way you write and put it does not speak well of you as a person as a whole. Some of the paragraphs you type are redundant and speak poorly of you. More like inciting an attack using words. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm true enough..its already good that the operator decide to do it unidirection with shorter operating hours rather than terminate the whole route.Who want to operate service that doesnt make a decent profit?You must know SMRT losing money for the estates towards city leg thus they decided to declare the amendment.SBST also operate unidirection to save all the losses..Only hiccup is the last bus timings,should at least strecht it to 02.45</div>

              <p>dd77, there are people who are working funny hours without the of benefit night buses in SG, it is a fact, if not how can Singaporeans buy their food and get their newspapers and many 24 hour functioning services when they wake up around 0530hrs in the morning?!<br><br>It is through the collective work of the workers working the grave yard shift!<br><br>This is a fact, dd77, must there be any evidence to prove that?<br><br>The reply is not a personal attack as you claimed, you are entitled to your opinion, i am entitled to mine, i am highlighting the point that there are folks working the grave yard shift and they may your next door neighbours, friends, relatives. There are also cleaners(elderly) who earned meagre salaries but are paying full fares when they used transport before 0630 hrs and previously before 0900hrs.<br><br>If you say i have launch personal attacks on people. PLEASE HIGHLIGHT to me so that i can elaborate on what i said, thank you.<br><br>I do not think i need anyone to think i am worthy of anyone in any sense or do i need to be praised for what i wrote. But words written in that particular context is thought carefully before being sent and posted, i am not a keyboard warrior.<br><br>I am going to repeat this again, as SG is evolving into a more Cosmopolitan city, there will be a need for more services jobs and working hours need to change, everyone has to adapt and thus the need for night bus services at an affordable price and timing for Singaporeans.<br><br>dd77, i said and emphasised my point and DO point out which paragraphs are redundant. I have seen, used many overseas transportation systems and are able to compare distinctively what is lacking in SG to offer a point of contrasting view.<br>  <br>Furthermore, I have been in this forum since Nov 2004, way before internet laws on defamation are out, i certainly do not need to incite an attack using words. <br><br>Thank You</p>

              <p>Bro, thank you for highlighting the facts for citybound(similar to wat dd77 wrote)... i know there are few passengers on the bus citybound but there are still passengers...<br><br>Just to quote an example,  NSF go pak tor v GF, send GF home after midnite, can take the bus back to city...<br><br>An alternative as train lines dun run 24hrs(NYC) for the man in the street...<br><br>Bus ops can never make enough money to break even in any country, it is to provide a decent standard of service(nite/day) for the commoners(like me)</p>
