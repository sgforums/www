So sometime 82 and 101 and be quite empty at around this route but at Hougang Int a lot of people will take Sv 101 as it is the fatest way to go to Monfort School, Hougang Ave 8, Hougang Green Shopping Market or Hougang Ave 9 and the only bus serves the Buangkok Drive or whatever road so that strectch of road a lot of people will take it</div>

How are you going to explain that.? Yes.. i know.. Svc like 920 have a low demand and UDs are being deployed on it.. Mind you PLs get this into your mind.. There is a Shortage of buses now going on.. so.. when they have no choice, UDs have to make it up for the shortage of buses.. there was also a period of time when UDs are being deployed on 970 and 75.. Are you trying to say that svcs. like 855, 853, 970 and 75 have LOW demand thats why UDs are being deployed on them ? Another point tat i would like to bring up.. Yes..
