Since you dont live in smrt areas and dont know the loadings of smrt buses well enough, then have the decency to refrain from making such statements that are not backed up with solid evidence as it may be misleading to others.<br><br>Anyway you should judge a service just by looking at its loadings on a small sector.<br><br>And in the future be careful from making words such as "<strong> all </strong> " {First post}.

If you are not sure of the situation, PLS DO NOT POST anything which seems logical to you BUT in reality, a OPINION made by you and NOT a FACT. If itz like what you had stated saying that services using Nissan are regarded as loss-making Services, How do you EXPLAIN the high demand Services like 855, 853 187 ? How are you going to explain that.? Yes.. i know.. Svc like 920 have a low demand and UDs are being deployed on it.. Mind you PLs get this into your mind.. There is a Shortage of buses now going on.. so.. when they have no choice, UDs have to make it up for the shortage of buses.. there was also a period of time when UDs are being deployed on 970 and 75.. Are you trying to say that svcs. like 855, 853, 970 and 75 have LOW demand thats why UDs are being deployed on them ? Another point tat i would like to bring up.. Yes.. UD might be an old bus to a few of you.. But.. Comments like "You mean this a Bus " really makes mi hurt.. if that came from a Non-BusFan, i could understand abit.. but.. If that came out from a BusFan.. i think.. y uought to wake Up and think of your actions.. UD might be Old.. BUT.. afterall, itz still A BUS.. im sure that the UD is Even older than a few of your in here in this forum. If you cant appreciate a bus like UD.. i think.. you better go do a reflection to see whether you are fit to call yourself a BusFan in the VEry 1st place.</div>
