A few days back i also saw bus stops at both outside and opposite senja grand, blk 628. I do really hope that there is a feeder service linking not only senja and segar area but also jelapang area (jelapang rd) ever since TIBS service 345 is withdrawn after the LRT is built.

            <div class='col-md body'>with regarding to earlier posts about connecting the North East and the North West (ie. BBT, CCK, BP) well, i have to agree its one big hassle to cross to areas stated..<br>however one MRT ride from CCK to AMK only takes 31 mins.<br>MRT from CCK to SKG takes 55 mins!<br><br>too bad that the central catchment area forced people to make one bog round to cross from north west / west to north east areas.<br><br>also, with this territory red tape, of course you wont see services in eg. SKG to Choa Chu Kang, not unloess CCK is still under SBS.<br><br>from memory, there are very few original Tibs svcs, esp when it mainly has Yishun under control.. tibs has much to thank SBS for the establishement  of the many routes it had taken over (such as sv190  :evil<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and many more..<br>the developement of woodlands also came at a later stage.<br><br>and, with the upcoming new MRT lines over the next few decades, i dont think such things may become reality, unless SBS takes over SMRt bus svcs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and, rem BP used to be a roadside terminal!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Woodlands services, like their Yishun counterparts, need Bendies to function as well. It'll be chaotic if the Bendies are replaced with normal SDs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
