This section profiles Pacific Internet, SingNet, and Cyberway, the three ISPs licensed by TAS since 1995.<br><br><strong>Pacific Internet (PI) </strong><br><br>PI began as the university network, Technet, five years ago, and became commercial two years ago.  They have approximately 85,000 analog dial-up customers and 300 corporate accounts (40% ISDN, 42% 64k, and 18% 128k).  Like the other ISPs, they offer a variety of services including Web hosting, server collocation (&lt; 5 customers), fax, pager and cell phone (text) gateways and Internet gaming.  Their international links are three EI circuits to Japan and one third of a T3 to the US.6.<br><br>PI differentiates themselves as selling the Internet as a lifestyle product, not a<br>technical product.  They co-market with large brands and channels like mcdonalds and supermarkets.  They are also in early talks with various Web TV vendors. They are beginning to sell to housing developers with the intention of serving buildings.  They are targeting vertical industries with their business marketing, for example, insurance, legal, shipping, and real estate companies.<br><br>They also claim a more private-sector mindset as an organization than SingNet which they feel was shaped to some extent by its roots in what had been a government owned monopoly telephone company.  They are more flexible and less bureaucratic.<br><br>Their Web site is the most visited in Singapore.  They claim to receive 60 million hits per month, compared to 3.5 million for Cyberway and 15 million for SingNet.<br><br><strong>SingNet</strong><br><br>SingNet, the first commercial ISP, is a subsidiary of Singapore Telecom, which has a telephone monopoly until the year 2000, but operates at an arms length from them, and derives no advantage from the relationship.  This impartiality is audited by TAS.<br><br>They offer much the same services as the others, with approximately 100,000 analog dial-up accounts, 3-400 ISDN accounts, and 2-300 leased lines.  Their other services are Internet paging, mobile phone email, wireless access, Web hosting, Web co-location, fax gateway, and assigning domain names.<br><br>My subjective impression is that they may be a bit more engineering oriented and less attuned to commercial marketing than the other networks, but that was based on visits to only two back-office locations and one walk-in registration center.<br><br>SingNet is distinguished from the others in that they operate the Singapore Internet Exchange (STIX) which is seeking to become a leading regional hub.  STIX peers with the other Singaporean ISPs and with several networks in the region.  (While they would state who they exchanged traffic with, they were somewhat vague about which links were upstream, peering, and downstream).<br><br>The decision on whether or not to peer with someone is made on a case-by-case basis after study of traffic patterns.  For example, they saw a lot of traffic between them and Japan was going through the US, and decided a direct connection to Japan would pay for itself.  Peers each pay for one half-circuit, and do not charge each other. Downstream customers pay for the entire circuit, plus fees.<br><br>STIX has 37 links to 24 nations.  The difficulty in building an intranational backbone is illustrated by Indonesia which has three STIX customers who are unwilling to cooperate with each other.  A big ISP does not want to subsidize his competitor by allowing them to achieve a lower communication cost, and the small ones do not want to advertise that they connect through a larger competitor.<br><br>Their Competition is A-Bone in Japan, Net Plus from Hong Kong Telecom, and<br>KDD.  A-bone has fewer than 10 customers, all at 2 mb.  Net Plus has a similar mix to STIX: 64k-1.5m.  KDD has around 60 ISPs and exchanges traffic with Asia, Australia (Telstra) and New Zealand.  A list of IXs maintained at http://www.isi.edu/div7/ra/NAPs/naps_ap.html shows the following IXs in the region:<br><br>HKIX - The HongKong Exchange<br>NSPIXP-2 - (In Japanese!)<br>IMnet - From NTT &amp; KDD (under development)<br>NZIX - Neutral New Zealand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>STIX - Singapore Telecom gets into the act<br>MM-MAP - Metro Manila (Philippines)<br>Western OZ Internet Exchange<br>AUIX - Some Australian Exchanges which seems to be limited to<br>being an Australian ISP peer point)<br><br>CyberWay<br><br>CyberWay is the newest ISP.  They are owned by SPH and STEC.  Unlike the other two ISPs, they competed for their license, and won on the basis of their emphasis on customer service and support.  CyberWay's one-time licensing fee of $450,000 was imposed retroactively on the first two ISPs to level the playing field.<br><br>CyberWay offers the same array of services as the others, and has 35,000 analog dial-up customers.  They have a 15 Mb/s link to Canada and a 256k link to Japan.  (Fifteen percent of their traffic is within Singapore).  CyberWay stresses strong marketing and customer service.  Examples of their marketing programs are:<br><br>Â• lower rates on weekends<br>Â• reselling through 26 partners (VARs) who specialize in schools and other<br>businesses (customers include government, SBA, NCB, IBM, NTT, banks, etc.<br>Â• direct sales force for business accounts<br>Â• free (1 MB) home page for all customers (&lt;10% use it) and a search engine for finding the home pages of people with various interests -- community building<br>Â• CD-ROM with $200 software with sign up<br>Â• web development tools to support people with home pages<br>Â• mirror site for Two-Cows and Simtel<br>Â• Personal News Watch -- selected News groups (not sure how this works -- it may just be a .newsrc file for Usenet News with a news reader)<br>Â• registration centers in department stores, cyber cafes, computer stores, events like the Singapore Book Fair, etc.  -- accounts are activated within 10 minutes and the store gets a commission<br>Â• They are the leader in meeting QOS requirements of the TAS.  (TAS discusses QOS on their Web page, but there is little information of value to a potential<br>customer).</div>
