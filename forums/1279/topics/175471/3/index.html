I was invited by someone (who will remain unknown, but I am not sure if they are an Admin or a Mod) to become a Moderator, but I refused, on the basis that I am an Admin of at least 3 other forums on Singapore buses, and that I am not living in Singapore, and thus my contribution would be extremely limited.  As for me being a sentimental old git, I find it rather funny, but it does not offend me, so I will not complain.  I did not ask for anyone to give me a title, but I suppose it is true.   I have enough photos of the 2 axle Leyland Olympians, the Lynx, the MAN 16.240, Darts in SBS livery, O.405s in SBS livery, 170 Mk IIIs in SBS colours, and TIBS liveried vehicles and buses on the 989, 521 and 167, as well as the 502 when it ran to Sengkang.  You kids should really just grow up and/or get a life, and instead of complaining and nitpicking about every single thing, either bite the bullet and leave the forum, or stay on that forum and chat and post openly.  I happily look on the forum and if there is anything worth replying to, I will reply, otherwise, I just won't bother.  Such a policy is adopted by the more senior members of the enthusiast community.  Maybe you should all foollow this example.</div>

I was invited by someone (who will remain unknown, but I am not sure if they are an Admin or a Mod) to become a Moderator, but I refused, on the basis that I am an Admin of at least 3 other forums on Singapore buses, and that I am not living in Singapore, and thus my contribution would be extremely limited.  As for me being a sentimental old git, I find it rather funny, but it does not offend me, so I will not complain.  I did not ask for anyone to give me a title, but I suppose it is true.   I have enough photos of the 2 axle Leyland Olympians, the Lynx, the MAN 16.240, Darts in SBS livery, O.405s in SBS livery, 170 Mk IIIs in SBS colours, and TIBS liveried vehicles and buses on the 989, 521 and 167, as well as the 502 when it ran to Sengkang.  You kids should really just grow up and/or get a life, and instead of complaining and nitpicking about every single thing, either bite the bullet and leave the forum, or stay on that forum and chat and post openly.  I happily look on the forum and if there is anything worth replying to, I will reply, otherwise, I just won't bother.  Such a policy is adopted by the more senior members of the enthusiast community.  Maybe you should all foollow this example.  </div></blockquote>In that case, how on earth did you get the title of "sentimental old git"? Can I be called "Scania freak"?</div>
