              <p>I hope they wont be so green when it comes to seletar and
                          subsequent packages.  I hope GA will come good after the
                          horrible mess in the punggol and pasir ris feeders. I love what
                          they did for 85 though, as one positive out of the many
                          negatives.</p>

              <p>I would say that GA actually did better than Tower Transit in terms of getting improvements in reliability, they look more stable than Tower when comparing the same timeframe (about 3 to 4 weeks since start of operations), at least based on my observations. Besides that, the buses are faster, which is good for commuters.</p>
              <p>This is despite having the issues with drivers leaving, and the higher percentage of new unexperienced drivers as according to carbikebus.</p>
              <p>The traffic situation at Punggol also seemed to have improved a lot over the past few weeks as compared to not just the start of GA operations, but even SBS times. While the jams at Jurong East during weekend evenings still looks the same as when SBS was operating Jurong East.</p>

              <p>GA is way bolder than TT and is willing to challenge the system... Personally I am extremely satisfied with GA, buses have been arriving regularly and the speed is impressive, contrary to TT. </p>
              <p>But what I like most about GA is its stride in creating a brand image it could call its own, striking a balance between distinction and uniformity (with LTA standards)... This is most seen in its clever placing of the logos on the buses, just the right size and position while not claiming too much "credit"... While TT only has that pathetic small logo at the top of the entrance, making me feel like it's just left hand to right hand business (no change), and worse still I feel like I'm riding on incomplete SBST buses...</p>
