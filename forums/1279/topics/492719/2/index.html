              <p>actually for employment of drivers should be done by join recruiting by NTUC and bus company instead that will be better.

              <p>it very irresponsible for those young drivers to quit just because of some job problems. especially when you are working in public transport service line.  nobody force the new driver to join but when joining please take up the responsibly.   </p>

              <p>Based on the news article on the operators who are interested, I would rank:</p>
              <p>1. Busways - Of all interested new operators, they are the 2nd largest in terms of public bus operations and seem serious about providing quality service. They should have a high chance of getting this package if their bid price is right this time (Bulim was within range but Loyang was too high)</p>
              <p>2. Woodlands Transport - LTA might want to try out a local private operator, and Woodlands Transport is the most suited for the job. They should have some experience in operating public bus services based on CDS and PPSS, though still relatively minor.</p>
              <p>3. National Express - They are a big player in coach and intercity services, but also has some experience in public bus operations. Coach and intercity services seem to be their expertise still, though it is worth a try if their bid price is right.</p>
              <p>4. Kumho Buslines/Tian San Shipping - Kumho only operates coach and intercity services, in both South Korea and Vietnam, while Tian San Shipping does not operate any bus services. I think their chances would be better if they partnered with a local private bus operator, preferably those who had operated CDS, PPSS or Premiums.</p>
              <p>5. Qingdao Jiaoyun Group/Travel GSH - Qingdao Jiaoyun is the largest in terms of public bus operations, while Travel GSH has some experience from PPSS operations. There might be a reason why their bids weren't shortlisted previously, as they might be lacking in certain aspects in the tender requirements. According to ST, they have beefed up their tender proposal, so they might actually stand a chance this time.</p>
              <p>If LTA wants to give it to the existing operators, I would rank:</p>
              <p>1. Tower Transit - They had been providing quality service so far, would like to see them taking up more packages in the future.</p>
              <p>2. SBS Transit - SBS has been around for ages, if LTA wants to award any packages in the future for local operators, SBS is actually the best bet.</p>
              <p>3. SMRT Buses - I rather LTA not award any package to them for now, unless all of the routes in the package are previously operated by SMRT. In this case they only have the Yishun routes.</p>
              <p>4. Go-Ahead - I rather LTA not award any package to them for now, not until they get all of their issues sorted out first.</p>

              <p>I would say <strong>SMRT.</strong></p>
              <p>Till now, SMRT has been the only operator to have successfully operated SDs, DDs and BBs and their transition between BBs to DDs have been pretty smooth on the trunk routes. SMRT has been quite passenger friendly and their efforts to continuously maintain all 3 types of buses is commendable.</p>
              <p>For now, those Bendys are still essential for Yishun feeders and this situation wont change by 2018. Those feeder services aren't DD ready. Unlike other HDB towns, Yishun feeders see such high turnover rates for services like 800 804 806 811 812 for such short distances because of that town structure. I stay in the area.</p>
              <p>Spamming DDs on these routes (given the routes are DD-friendly which Im quite doubtful, given Yishun feeders turn into those very narrow roads) will be quite a disaster for Yishun residents where people everage age group is high and they have never seen DDs on these routes. On the other hand spamming SDs will cause these services to all become like 860 which I think is really very stupid.</p>
              <p>If LTA really dont want to use bendys after the O405G era (which i really hope not - atleast retain them for feeders), then still SMRT will be best to do the transition in the most people-friendly way. And there will need to be more services like 117 and 103 to alleviate the loadings on feeders so that bendys become less needed.</p>
              <p>As for YCK and AMK services, SMRT is capable to operate them with the DD buses also given the fact that it is operating Volvo B9TL, MAN A95 and ADLs (more models than any other operators). </p>
              <p><strong>If not SMRT, my vote is for SBST but SBST will have to learn how to use MAN buses and ADLs</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PLEASE NO GAG OR TT. Their buses are really crawling. Good job at increasing the capacity but if their buses continue crawling, people are going to give up taking buses and spam the MRT. Cant afford crawling buses in fast-paced Singapore. Time is too precious.</strong></p>

              <p>GA crawling? Most of the GA buses I took were in a rush. Much faster than a lot of SMRT buses nowadays as SMRT has slowed down a lot since GCM started.</p>
              <p>But I do agree with you. No more slow buses please.</p>
