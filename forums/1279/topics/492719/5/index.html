              <p>The oldest SBS Citaros are nowhere better than the SMRT ones. Though I must say that the materials used in the Citaro makes it harder to clean compared to those used in the Gemilang bodied buses. Also, the Citaros generally sound overworked, regardless of the company operating it, they are just the wrong type of bus for Singapore's operating conditions.</p>
              <p>But I have to agree with the others that SBS's maintenance doesn't seem as good as before. Its not just limited to one depot, but across the whole operation. Citaros roaring eg 6574 now, 6065 a few months back, the older B9TLs also haven't aged well, that can be easily observed.</p>

              <p>i didnt say and i dont think u should be expecting all buses to
              be totally clean.. it is a public bus afterall and commuters
              litter. in fact such scenarios are so much more prominent on smrt

              <p>Then where's your evidence?? Ah, talk so easy hor, say I generalise. At least I got somehing to show... You one to talk lor! Pot calling kettle black. </p>
              <p>Now you wanna dodge from reality already... the truth is right there and it is harsh reality. Just because people litter, means that the operators then do not have the obligation to keep their buses clean? What kind of reasoning is that?? I am not even expecting all buses to be totally clean lor... just like how I won't (and you shouldn't) expect all SMRT buses to be clean... but truth be told I am telling you that AS A WHOLE SMRT buses are way cleaner than SBST buses! So snap out of it! Saying that buses are dirty =/= expecting all buses to be clean!</p>
              <p>(btw I can get more pics if u want I see them on the buses every day anyway)</p>

              <p>Sure maybe you're right about the OCs... but you are WRONG about the difference man. The KUBs are sure as hell BEAT in terms of maintenance... jerky, roaring, overheating easily... nowadays more often are cases of buses unable to pickup... Don't even talk about the CDGEs man, I bet you wont even dare to sit on the seats since they are so charred and dirty... esp the last row... </p>

              <p>The oldest SBS Citaros are nowhere better than the SMRT ones.
              Though I must say that the materials used in the Citaro makes it
              harder to clean compared to those used in the Gemilang bodied
              buses. Also, the Citaros generally sound overworked, regardless of
              the company operating it, they are just the wrong type of bus for
              Singapore's operating conditions.</p>
              <p>But I have to agree with the others that SBS's maintenance
              doesn't seem as good as before. Its not just limited to one depot,
              but across the whole operation. Citaros roaring eg 6574 now, 6065 a
              few months back, the older B9TLs also haven't aged well, that can
              be easily observed.</p>
