            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I would feel that I had to wait much longer for TIBS buses. It is not uncommon for one to wait for 20~30 minutes for TIBS 970 and 61.<br><br>However I would feel that TIBS buses travel at a much faster speed. Thus I enjoy TIBS ride rather than SBST ride. I took TIBS 61, 106 and 75 very often, the buses may travel at top speed along HOlland Road. On the other hand, SBST 7 travel at usual slow speed even during off-peak hour along a little traffic Holland ROad.<br><br>I had reported an incidence to SBST regarding SBST 198. I had commented the irregular arrival time at Commonwealth Ave towards North Buona VIsta. I waited for SBST 198 at bus stop at 0745  on most week day. As the bus stop at Commmonwealth Ave was only a few bus stops from Bukit Merah Interchange, I had expected the bus to arrive with little fluctuations. At times I waited for 30 minutes for SBST 198. I wrote to SBST and query how is it possible for me to wait for 30 minutes when the peak frequency was 8 minutes and the ride from Bukit Merah Interchange to Commonwealth Ave was a short and smooth one?<br><br>And after that query, though SBST 198 was pretty punctual, however I feel that it was not travel as fast as what I have been used to. That SBST 198 never speed along AYE towards Jurong.<br><br>Anyway, that incident happened 2 years back. And I vow never to report any long waiting time to SBST. Despite long waiting time, I prefer a much faster travelling speed.</div>

Bus drivers should have the empowerment to pick up from alternative route (to avoid the traffic jam), at least those in the downstream need not have to suffer from the traffic jam too (waiting indefinitely).<br><br>That's not the record yet, I had waited for 45 minutes for TIBS 61, and eventually it arrived (at least). And the reason, a traffic accident along Tanglin Halt Road , resulting in massive jam. I may sound stupid to have waited for 45 minutes for a bus, however I would always feel that buses are on the way, thus I continue waiting rather than walk to busstops along HOlland Road or Commonwealth Ave.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Just a question, if a driver knows that there will be a traffic jam ahead of him, will he still drive to it and caught himself into the jam??? Example if there is a fallen tree that blocked Tanglin Halt Road, would a TIBS61 driver still drive into that road?</span></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;">I'm afraid for this, you have to contact Tibs</span>.<br><br>I've waited once for a 167 bus for 1 hour plus at Jln Bt Merah. My dad asked the driver why he is so late. The driver replied, "Jam at Orchard".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had this experience in late 2002 when a tour coach bus broke down at the junction of Lorong 7 &amp; Lorong 8 Toa Payoh. Svc 238 turn here towards Braddell Rd. I was in the first bus. As the bus approached behind the coach bus, the driver simply waited and waited. I dont know what's the reason. I felt like going up to the driver to take an alternative route but i didnt.<br><br>Soon after, the 2nd and 3rd bus came, queuing up behind the 1st bus. After being struck there for about 12 min, the driver alighted the frustrated and impatient passengers at Blk 17A Bus stop along Lorong 7. After that, the driver U-turn at a carpark entrance up ahead and continue its normal route from there.<br><br>Another person told me that one of the buses even cut through the carpark to get to Lorong 8! The carpark entrance was next to Blk 12 and the exit was next to Blk 11A. What an ingenious idea by that driver <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Judging from this expereince, it seems like drivers are given strict instructions not to drive anywhere they want, especially if that place is not part of the route. But in situations like this, cant the driver be more flexible?</div>

And what if there is a massive jam rather than road blocked, would TIBS amend the route too? What I meant was that what if the fallen crane block only 2 lanes and cause massive jams? Would TIBS still amend the route?<br><br>Just like the massive jam along Orchard Road on Saturday afternoon (20 Dec), the road was not blocked but it just take more than the usual time to clear. Imagine waiting for full 35 minutes and no TIBS 106 arrive!</div>

And bus companies should always have backup plan on hand. For instance if there is a massive jam in Orchard Boulevard, TIBS should have deployed buses to start from Napier Road instead for TiBS 106 and TIBS 77.<br><br>Instead of spending obscene monies on GPC to locate their buses, the bus companies should have thought on how to keep their buses on schedule. I agree that road conditions are unpredictable, which may cause a bus schedule to go hay wire, but if they have a system which prevent buses to be caught in a jam or having buses to start plying from where the jam end, commuters at downstreams need not have to wondering for long why their buses not arriving.<br><br>That's especially important for someone like me, who at Holland Ave, only one bus to Clementi, one bus to Orchard and one bus to Chinatown.<br></div>
