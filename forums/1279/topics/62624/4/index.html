I really didn't see the need of such a service. It only jack up their operating expense.<br><br>What if you have been waited for 35 minutes, and they tell you the headway of TIBS106 is 12mins? Would you get more fumes???<br><br>THe phone service should be for bus captains to update the road conditions to their bus companies.
