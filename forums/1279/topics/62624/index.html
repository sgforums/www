            <div class='col-md body'>From what i experienced by going home late at night, especially after 10pm, I've never waited for a SBST service for more than 15 minutes. If it's more than 15 minutes, there will be 2 buses coming together.<br><br>I think that TIBS is cutting down on resources and is trying to stagger the frequency as much as possible to maximise passenger load on the bus than the buses running on empty at night. Although SBST does that, it doesnt have headways of more than 15 minutes if there is medium to high demand of the service.</div>

For example, service 167 at night, there are more passengers towards Sembawang than passengers towards the city area, so Tibs deploy buses towards Bukit Merah at a longer frequency.<br></div>

The PTC requires all services during off-peak hours to have headways not more than 15 minutes. If they do, the bus company would have to state the departure times on the bus stops.<br><br>For eg. Service 927 125 186 are some services which have frequencies of more than 15 minutes during off-peak.<br><br>To find out more about PTC guidelines, visit http://www.ptc.gov.sg/nr10.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...yeah usually TIBS buses frequency is longer than SBS Transit's at night... The longest I waited for an SBS Transit bus at night was 20 minutes... While for TIBS, my friend waited 45 minutes for 961 along Bukit Timah Road (towards Kallang direction) sometime near the end of last year... And even during the day, I once waited 20 minutes for the now defunct 989 at Changi Airport just 1 or 2 weeks before it was withdrawn.</div>
