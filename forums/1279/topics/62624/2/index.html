There was once there was some kind of pipe laying construction going on at Yishun Ave 5 (towards Yishun MRT) and even though the number of buses on services 811, 856 and 859 are somehow the same, the waiting time was terrible. Seen 2 or 3 service 859 buses reaching Yishun in a matter of 10 to 15 mins.</div>

The others had their meal breaks before 1800. After the meal break, that bus goes back into operation and 9 buses are operating from 1842 - 1923.

If you're lucky, the timesheet is displayed on the pane above the driver. If not, it's on the dashboard where it's very hard to take down the timings. In addition to that, I've analysed the timings of the buses for 11 hours in late November. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
