              <p>I witnessed when this 8030L bus on Express 502 at Suntec CIty on a raining afternoon with light drizzle. Spotted about 3 persons taking photos of the bus. Two of them was standing at the bus stop photographing the left side, but there was one person who dash acrossed slightly before this 8030L bus arrived at the stop to photograph. <br><br>After the bus closed its doors and prepared to move out of the bus bay, the person standing at the divider dashed across the wet road with traffic turning in from the main road to board the bus, with the bus making another stop to open the front door for him to board.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Perhaps you should tell this people first instead of we citizens, and not that I seriously challenging TP, but rather to seriously ask if are they doing the right things being a role model.

              A lot of roads are being upgraded to become semi expressways, traffic is getting heavy... No sense of danger... Forgot, all dunno how to drive.. must wait till get knocked down by car then you know the pain..
              
              And, I'll say again, if these posts are read by mata... They can deal w/ you for challenging police authority... They dun need to care are you a kid or a troll, semua they reserve the right to investigate on you... Dun need to wait for the law's stick to hit on you...
              
              As for the road signboard, the Marsiling case is clear cut... There's obviously no jaywalking signboard as there's a overhead bridge... 
              
              If your kids can start hurling, mocking at people telling your about traffic rules and dare to say people narrow minded... Then what's the traffic rule for? What your kids take the law for?
              
              Dun wait till one fine day the law deals with your, then your start hurling saying no one warned your or I didn't know it's not allowed bla bla bla...

                  seriously ask if are they doing the right things being a role

              <p>Eh hello, from a post about TP turns into jaywalk/safety? I know
              my safety, that's for sure. You can't simply stop them too, neither
              can I(like duh~)? And please, even if you give ur fucking care to
              those jaywalkers, "lecture" them about safety, I believe they still
              jaywalk as and when it is~ So what's the point? </p>
              <p>Wake up all your ideas, you can't stop people from doing
              anything they wish. It's theirs responsibility~ Don't tell me 1
              unknown stranger die, and you gonna sit there and cry like as if
              he/she is related? And since when did people keep using these
              dividers to snap(like frequently)? </p>

              <p>I guess you still don't quite get what I mean do you? If people really jaywalk, they should know when to do(obviously NOT when there's high traffic coming or even that stupid infront of any TP, which I guess TP now don't even bother).  </p>
