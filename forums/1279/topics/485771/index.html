              <p>Otherwise 0.2 seconds per pax is neligible if pax are travelling for &gt;30mins esp on 161 and 168. At least pax get a seat and will be less frustrated.</p>

              <p><strong>"Singapore's traffic conditions, especially during peak hours, are not suitable for double-deckers, as they have a longer dwelling time at bus stops. This will more likely lead to bus bunching and extend the travelling time for passengers."</strong></p>
              <p>He is so stupid. OMG.</p>
              <p>Does he even know</p>
              <p>-- During peak hours when there is traffice, DDs are more efficient than SDs even at bus stops on high loading routes. Lets not take 190 but take 963 or 88 (when had SDs) for example. The SDs crawl on these services. Once it reaches 70 pax, and at every stop 3-4 pax alight, no one can board because the whole gangway is clogged. People have to push to make their exit. BC has to shout at pax to move behind if he wants to take any new pax. In all this bus waits for 2-3 minutes, always causing bunching. Hence, bunching is so much more frequent with SDs than DDs.</p>
              <p>I am not even commenting about the loading that requires DDs for many routes during peak hours.</p>
              <p>What a dumbass!!</p>

              <p>Just take for example: sv 27, 34, 36, 53, 15</p>
              <p>Buses are constantly added on these services as DDs cannot be used. Does the idiot not see that if these services had DDs, lesser buses would have been used than current fleet. Is he blind not to observe the bunching issues on SDs??</p>

              with most passenger not staying in the bus for more than 15minutes,
              then I would agree with what he says.</p>
              <p>Otherwise 0.2 seconds per pax is neligible if pax are travelling
              for &gt;30mins esp on 161 and 168. At least pax get a seat and will
              be less frustrated.</p>

              <p>0.2 seconds per pax is not alot on these services you mentioned, since the pax board and alight not very often. I don't agree with him on this.</p>
              <p>However, if you look at svcs like 241, 243 where easily 60 pax can board from int and alight within 10mins, then 0.2 sec per pax is alot. Also same for some long dist trunk services that ply between MRT stations and ppl use it like feeder. This needs better buses like 3 door DD or multi door bendy (4-5 doors would be nice) for exceptionally fast boarding and alighting.</p>
