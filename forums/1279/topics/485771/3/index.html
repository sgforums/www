              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The fact: It takes 0.2
                          seconds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per
                          pax</span> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">longer to disembark
                          from a DD compared to SD.</span></p>
              <p>Did anyone even ask why in the world Prof Lee would use such a
                          metric?</p>
              <p>Apparently not.</p>
              <p>The guess is simple: The method of using the length of time to
                          disembark all pax divided by the number of pax is to
                          <strong>normalise</strong> the length of time, against the bias
                          that is the larger amount of people for the DD to disembark.</p>
              <p>In laymen terms, it means that DDs hold at bus-stops longer for
                          reasons beyond that there are more pax.</p>
              <p>Using logic, it has to be the lay-out of the DD, coupled to the
                          fact that pax has to walk more within the bus, to exit. Thus adding
                          to the extra dwell-time.</p>
              <p>Prof Lee then understandably questions the wisdom of continuing
                          the current layout, which is also a logical conclusion, and a
                          legitimate question.</p>
              <p>But it inspires howls and wails and then irrelevantly gleeful
                          discussions about what service should get what.</p>
              <p>If numbers are not your forte (nor fault of yours), and respect
                          is not in your dictionary, then is it really the education system
                          that is solely to blame for both at the same time?</p>
              <p>Please think about it.</p>
              <p>Edit: I re-read the article in case I sound stupid when I accuse
                          others of thus. That's when I found the line in the
                          article: <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The
                          study was done based on an equal passenger to passenger ratio, to
                          eliminate the expectation that a double-decker would have a longer
                          dwelling time since it can hold more passengers.</span></span></p>
              <p>Guess the education did some good for me after all.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is implied (and indeed stated in the news article) that the current double-decker bus in Singapore design creates bottlenecks for alighting passengers.</p>
              <p>But there is some validity to criticism on the possibility that the research focuses on each individual bus at the bus stop and not the capacity of the route or bus stop as a whole in the same given timeframe (such as alighting/boarding capacity per hour at a bus stop, possibly not taking into consideration additional time spent waiting behind an articulated bus before alighting, and other macro factors).</p>
              <p>Unfortunately I am still not able to retrieve a copy of the full article, but  I would be very interested to see what the eight bus types are and the data from this research.</p>

              <p>I do wonder how receptive LTA would be to this research (and other researches) on bus layout and designs, especially given that they will be the decision-makers in defining requirements in their bus procurements after 2016. LTA did increase the number of doors per car for the Thompson Line to reduce dwelling times.</p>
              <p>The issue of passengers crowding around the exit door and not moving to the rear is another long-time problem that needs more than just courtesy campaigns and stickers to be tackled effectively.</p>

Also significant in this respect is the use of lighter Ster seats. </span></p>

              <p>as i said the engine spec can change to a higher cc for the air-con unit. the orignal volvo wright also had low engine CC for england but when hong kong and singapore buy the bus it a different model offer. and also the new design wright windows on the bus is better for singapore use that what i trying to say. <strong>NOT the</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> eng</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ine cc i try to compare. also if you read the page the wright company said the spec is not fix.

              <p>I agree with your 3 situations but, this is still an oversimplification of the actual situation that does not take into account of the boarding and alighting pattern of different routes.</p>
              <p>For example, some trunk services that pass through MRT stations and have been acting as feeders as well due to BSEP. The alighting and boarding with DD can be even slower than with a SD, due to the bottleneck of the single staircase (20 pax alighting from upper deck, and 20 boarding pax have to wait for all of them to clear and can't simultaneously board and alight unlike on SD and Bendys). Example: 154 at Clementi MRT towards BNL at Pm peak, but there's many more...</p>
              <p>In short, with different boarding and alighting patterns, the flow of passengers within the bus also can affect the dwell time.</p>
              <p>With our bus network undergoing transition into a short-medium distance transport for passengers, running DDs with high pax turnover will just remove the benefits that DDs provides. This was one of the reasons why Sydney Buses was less enthused with using DDs during peak hour in the city center.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">DDs have more seats, takes up as much space as rigids. the stairs is one of the issues, it cannot do simultaneous boarding and alighting. owing to its height, it has higher centre of gravity, it is more likely to topple.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bendies allows for quicker alighting with both of its rear doors as opposed to the only doors on DDs and Rigids. it also turns easily with the help of the flexible body. it has some drawbacks. it takes about 1.5 times the space but having similar capacity as DDs.</span></p>
