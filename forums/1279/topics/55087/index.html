Only if you saw a "P" then it would be 9348. Unless u only looked at the 4 numbers and didnt notice the check digit.</div>

So in the case of a double decker, the officer has to check both the lower deck and upper deck, and may result in using more manpower during the peak hours. I think that the superbuses on service 9 currently is for trial purposes.<br></div>
