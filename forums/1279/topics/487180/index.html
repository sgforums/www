              <p>This is a follow-up to the newspaper report discussed in this thread:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1279/topics/485771">http://sgforums.com/forums/1279/topics/485771</a></p>
              <p>The academic paper has been published. You will need a University or research subscription to access the full copy:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856414002183">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856414002183</a></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methodology</span></p>
              <p>Eight bus models were used in the research, and a week's worth of dataset from April 2011 (possible criticism: is the dataset too small?). The models were:</p>
              <p>- Leyland Olympian 3-Axle<br>- Volvo B9TL WEG2<br>- Scania K230UB Euro IV<br>- Scania K230UB EEV<br>- Volvo B10M Mark IV (sample size indicates a single sub-variant was used)<br>- Mercedes-Benz O405 (capacity suggests DM, but large sample size indicates a broad fleet was used)<br>- Mercedes-Benz OC500LE<br>- Mercedes-Benz O405G (sample size suggests a broad fleet was used)</p>
              <p>and the specifications based on sgwiki. And yes, I can forsee where the debate is going to start. A lot of technical information on sgwiki isn't accurate.</p>
              <p>Boarding and alighting activities were timed separately.</p>
              <p>The findings of the research are summarised as follow:</p>
              <p>- Average boarding times ranged from 1.68s (MB OC500LE) to 2.02s (Volvo B10M) per passenger. Total average is 1.78s per passenger. O405G and LO3X fared worse than total average (1.78s and 1.93s respectively), while B9TL WEG2 was 0.02s better.</p>
              <p>- The difference is apparent in the average alighting times per passenger. Total average is 1.48s per passenger. O405G fared best at 1.26s per passenger (obviously, two doors). OC500LE was second best at 1.48 per passenger. LO3X and Volvo B10M tied for the worst timing at 1.78s per passenger. B9TL WEG2 was second worst at 1.75s per passenger. Scania K230UB Euro IV, EEV and O405 were 1.54s, 1.50s, 1.52s per passenger respectively.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paper's analysis</span></p>
              <p>- High occupancy of bus actually made alighting faster, not slower.</p>
              <p>- The more steps there are on the entrance of the bus, the longer it takes for passengers to board and alight.</p>
              <p>- Passengers on DD buses tend to wait upstairs until the bus comes to a halt, delaying alighting time. Boarding time is not affected. Recommends that double-deck buses are more useful when there is 
                                  high demand and many passengers alight at one particular bus stops.</p>
              <p>- A large variation of boarding and alighting times between different bus models can lead to irregular frequency and service unrreliability.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My own analysis<br></span></p>
              <p>- The paper seems to suggest double-deck buses should be deployed on long-haul routes, and routes where most people are transferring to MRT station rather than for point-to-point travel.</p>
              <p>- It can be implied that older buses with steps should be retired in favour of new buses with step-free access to reduce dwell times. This is already the case as older models are quickly being replaced these days.</p>
              <p>- It can also be implied that operators should use a single model, or bus models with similar dwelling times in a single route to increase reliability of that particular route. This importance has increased since the introduction of BSRF.</p>

              <p>I thought the discussion could improve once the blanks are filled in. Anyone researching on Singapore bus transport will find this data a treasure trove.</p>
              <p>Some of you may quickly notice that there is no data for Citaro, MAN A22 and A24 due to the age of the dataset. For those who are already gathering data at the<a href="/forums/1279/topics/479683?page=32"> loading thread</a>, gathering this missing data is easy. You will need a stopwatch. During your journey:</p>
              <p>1. Time boarding and alighting separately. Do one at a time (unless two people can do each). Start from the moment the BC presses the door open button, and stop the moment the BC presses the door close button.<br>2. Record number of card-paying passengers. Do not include cash-paying passengers. One way is to listen for the number of beeps on the reader.<br>3. Additional time (e.g. card errors, searching for card) should be factored in, as it was for this research paper.<br>4. Record the numbers over a range of routes (feeder, trunk, express).<br>5. Divide the total time the door stays open over the number of card-paying passengers.</p>
              <p>If the paper's hypothesis is correct, I would expect the MAN A24 to improve its boarding and alighting time per passenger over the O405G. Not sure if there would be any difference between low-entry and low-floor configuration though.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some of my thoughts:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Obviously, newer rigid buses with no steps at the doors have faster boarding/alighting than older buses with steps. However, I think we can look at buses with 3 doors to further improve boarding/alighting time. I'm not an expert in this area, but I think some LHD buses with 3 doors are available in Europe, although RHD buses with 3 doors are hard to come by. It would require specific requests from the operators or LTA (whoever is purchasing buses) and close co-operation with the bus manufacturers, but 3 door RHD buses for SG or Asian markets should be explored.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-As SMRT has mentioned when they announced their purchase of their E500s recently, DDs are more suitable for long haul trunk routes where pax boarding/alighting activity is more concentrated at certain specific stops, rather than short haul feeder routes with frequent boarding/alighting at many stops.While DDs provide more capacity w/o the extra space of bendies, the question is how we can speed up boarding/alighting and reduce dwell time. The Borismaster has a 3rd door and extra staircase at the back, but this comes at the cost of reducing capacity since the back staircase takes up significant space.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While it's not perfect, I think the Borismaster's design is a step in the right direction, and further experimentation with redesigning DDs (or other bus types in general) should be done to improve passenger flow while minimising the trade offs. For example, the door width may be increased, or there can be a single staircase for the top deck leading directly to a dedicated entrance at the back.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Bendies have no problem with bottlenecks at boarding/alighting with the presence of an extra door. Their main issue is the extra road space they occupy, and being more difficult to manoeuver around tight corners (leading to certain route restrictions). Years ago, SBST concluded that bendies were not suitable and sold off their 2 demonstrator buses. Thus, SBST uses DDs to provide extra capacity for both their long haul trunks as well as short haul feeders (which SMRT has rightly pointed out are more suited for bendy operations, due to shorter dwell time with easier boarding/alighting).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Under the government contracting model with all buses belonging to the govt/LTA in future, we could possibly see feeders currently under SBST eg 334, 222 that currently use DDs using bendies instead, whether operated by SBST (using buses leased from LTA) or by SMRT or a new operator. The issue is whether, and to what extent, LTA supports the use of bendies in Singapore. Another problem would be the possible lack of space with ever-shrinking bus interchanges.</p>

              <p>The study only takes into account boarding/alighting to indicate DDs not fit. Big flaw in study:</p>
              <p>1. does not take into account # more buses required if say all DDs on sv 88 were to be replaced by SDs.</p>
              <p>2. does not take into account more qualitative factors like "comfort for passengers". Imagine standing all the way on 168 from Tampines to Woodlands</p>
              <p>3. does not take into account how more crowded our interchanges would be if DDs were not there and only SDs were used. Lets for instance even take into account feeder sv like 334 that gets 100+ pax on every bus in PM peak. When the sole KUB comes, it can never take the load and still have 30-40 pax in quque (still wonder why its not become DD slot yet). Imagine then if 334 had all SDs like in previous days.. the number of buses you would had to add</p>
              <p>On another note, sgbuses, I am not very sure why you opened this topic again for discussion. Was already discussed, no!?</p>

              <p>The study only takes into account boarding/alighting to indicate

              <p>1. does not take into account # more buses required if say all
              DDs on sv 88 were to be replaced by SDs.</p>
              <p>2. does not take into account more qualitative factors like
              "comfort for passengers". Imagine standing all the way on 168 from
              Tampines to Woodlands</p>
              <p>3. does not take into account how more crowded our interchanges
              would be if DDs were not there and only SDs were used. Lets for
              instance even take into account feeder sv like 334 that gets 100+
              pax on every bus in PM peak. When the sole KUB comes, it can never
              take the load and still have 30-40 pax in quque (still wonder why
              its not become DD slot yet). Imagine then if 334 had all SDs like
              in previous days.. the number of buses you would had to add</p>
              <p>On another note, sgbuses, I am not very sure why you opened this

              <p>I think nobody would question the suitability of double-deck buses for long-haul routes. The research paper itself appear to confirm this as well.</p>
              <p>I re-opened this topic not solely to start the double-deck v articulated bus debate. With the results we can properly critique on the research rather than dismissing it off-hand. Furthermore, these same set of numbers can also be used to recognize other possible issues.</p>
              <p>Another way to look at this research is to think how can the interior configuration of the double-deck bus be modified to cater for feeder and short-haul routes. Would a straight and wider staircase design improve dwelling times because passengers could move up and down faster? Should we have two set of staircases? Three doors? More standing area? What aspects of any one particular bus model of the same type (i.e. OC500LE) made boarding and alighting so efficient that can be brought over to future procurements?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Some of my thoughts:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Obviously, newer rigid buses with no steps at the doors have
                  faster boarding/alighting than older buses with steps. However, I
                  think we can look at buses with 3 doors to further improve
                  boarding/alighting time. I'm not an expert in this area, but I
                  think some LHD buses with 3 doors are available in Europe, although
                  RHD buses with 3 doors are hard to come by. It would require
                  specific requests from the operators or LTA (whoever is purchasing
                  buses) and close co-operation with the bus manufacturers, but 3
                  door RHD buses for SG or Asian markets should be explored.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-As SMRT has mentioned when they announced their purchase of their
                  E500s recently, DDs are more suitable for long haul trunk routes
                  where pax boarding/alighting activity is more concentrated at
                  certain specific stops, rather than short haul feeder routes with
                  frequent boarding/alighting at many stops.While DDs provide more
                  capacity w/o the extra space of bendies, the question is how we can
                  speed up boarding/alighting and reduce dwell time. The Borismaster
                  has a 3rd door and extra staircase at the back, but this comes at
                  the cost of reducing capacity since the back staircase takes up
                  significant space.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">While it's not perfect, I think the Borismaster's design is a step
                  in the right direction, and further experimentation with
                  redesigning DDs (or other bus types in general) should be done to
                  improve passenger flow while minimising the trade offs. For
                  example, the door width may be increased, or there can be a single
                  staircase for the top deck leading directly to a dedicated entrance
                  at the back.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-Bendies have no problem with bottlenecks at boarding/alighting
                  with the presence of an extra door. Their main issue is the extra
                  road space they occupy, and being more difficult to manoeuver
                  around tight corners (leading to certain route restrictions). Years
                  ago, SBST concluded that bendies were not suitable and sold off
                  their 2 demonstrator buses. Thus, SBST uses DDs to provide extra
                  capacity for both their long haul trunks as well as short haul
                  feeders (which SMRT has rightly pointed out are more suited for
                  bendy operations, due to shorter dwell time with easier
                  boarding/alighting).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Under the government contracting model with all buses belonging to
                  the govt/LTA in future, we could possibly see feeders currently
                  under SBST eg 334, 222 that currently use DDs using bendies
                  instead, whether operated by SBST (using buses leased from LTA) or
                  by SMRT or a new operator. The issue is whether, and to what
                  extent, LTA supports the use of bendies in Singapore. Another
                  problem would be the possible lack of space with ever-shrinking bus
                  interchanges.</p>

              <p>SBST has been a heavy user of DDs since the 1970s. Back then, they used bi-axle non-aircon ones which were only mid-capacity (90 pax or so), being only 10.5m long. It was only in 1993 that the LO3X ADD was introduced. Routes 240 and 334 had been dominated by bi-axle DDs since Day #1 of operation and it was inevitable that tri-axle ones would eventually take over.</p>
              <p>Bendies, on the other hand, have had a short history, being only introduced by Tibs in 1996. Tibs's successor SMRT Buses may be right in pointing out that bendies are better suited for feeders. However, most of SBST's operational areas are not well-configured for bendies, neither is Singapore's infrastructure on the whole.</p>
              <p>The capacity for a Mercedes O405G is 132, which is 7 less than that of the tri-axle Volvo Olympian. This difference is actually minimal.</p>
              <p>Bi-axle DDs can be likened to maxi-buses like the Volvo B10M-70, which is 14m long. According to Singapore Buses Wikia, SBS997A could carry up to 110 pax. </p>

              <p style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">the legal passenger capacity on all buses are very likely to be computed on a formula that involves weight rather than actual standing space occupied. such a formula would allow PTOs to meet the &lt;90% loading criterion with ease, although create real-world loading issues frequently as the actual loading of buses are always &lt;&lt;90% of their legal capacity.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">'different buses for different situtations', if that is how the paper can be summed up. for the same number of alighting pax, bendies give generally quicker alighting times than double deckers due to the added door. SMRT has clearly recognised the strengths of the bendy and DD, although it still remains to be seen whether they would fully follow through with additional bendy/DD purchases.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">as sgbuses has pointed out, redesigning the interior of the buses may be the way to go such that passenger flow within the bus is optimised and fewer instances of opposing passenger flows give rise to quicker boarding and alighting times.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">to start the ball rolling...</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">1) stickers on the front door leafs stating the recommended mode of payment - this reduces congestion should a cash-paying passenger enter from the right door leaf then approach the validator after the stanchion</p>

If a 12m 2 stairs DD can hold 94 pax, it might still be better to deploy SDs with the Euro IV design with more standing area. No matter how much standing area is made available on the lower deck, there still needs to be a minimal number of seats to cater to the aged and disabled. And these grps of ppl frequent on feeders, with Singapore facing a aging population. So it might still be wiser to use SDs and increase frequencies abit as opposed to exploring 12m 2 stairs DD (I.e. if LTA doesnt even want to use bendies for feeders)</p></div>
