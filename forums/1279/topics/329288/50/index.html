              <p>I don't even see the need of taking many pieces for myself. I do find it unfriendly to take alot of them and leaving none for others. For those who have the habit of taking many pieces of guides, this is my so-called warning for you, you may think you won't get caught, but let me assure you, when you are caught, it will be ugly.</p>

              <p>I really agree with ur 1st question at the top.<br><br>And it's not only Bedok but many other Ints are also facing this problem.When i and .SBS9888Y. went to Clementi Int yesterday,both the racks had been thoroughly wiped out except for a few folded and crumpled guides left.<br><br>This is what i tried explaining to ZYX2005 but he just dosen't get it.He thinks he is doing good here by revealing the info when new guides come out.I understand that.But everytime he reveals a info abt a new guide,that's it.Go to that Int for the next 2-3 days and u would find that nearly half the rack would have been wiped out.Keep on checking until ard 1 week and 3/4 of the rack or the whole rack would have been wiped out.<br><br>Just 2 weeks ago when i went to Pasir Ris Int and asked for the svc 5 guide at the office since it was not at the racks,the green man told me that it was on the racks.When i said no,he was stunned and said that some people must have took the whole stack and left.When i heard this,i was even more shocked.So i went to Bt Merah Int and took the svc 5 guides from the racks there.<br><br>This is exactly what happens when u reveal info abt new guides here.Even after how much we explain to them not to reveal info here,they still think that they are right and insist on posting here making all the guides dissappear so fast from the racks.Like ngjy22 says,i rather a person finds out abt the guides himself through luck and keeps the info to himself rather than blurting it out here.Seems that posting abt this guides here are like a bomb now.Today u post and tomorrow that's it.</p>
