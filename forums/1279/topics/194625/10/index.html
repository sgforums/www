Don't accuse people of cloning too if you don't have concrete proof.<br><br>Can you please stop ranting &amp; raving because you start to sound like an 'idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'...and it makes you appear like you're on the brink of insanity.<br><br>What do you define high service standard?  What do you know about service?  Do you think you can do better than the management of SBS Transit?  I have my reservations about it.  Anyway, different people perceive 'standard of service' differently.  Honestly, we are still lucky in Singapore.  We have a majority fleet of air-con buses as compared to other countries.<br><br>And I have to caution you about what you said, about the people abusing the power on a/c deployment.  If I report this to SBS Transit, I wonder if you would get into trouble with them or not.  So please watch your words carefully and I hope the topic would end here.  If you insist on carrying on, and someone brings this matter to SBS Transit, I don't think it would look too good on you.<br><br>And it makes me wonder if you have a car, and you are not a regular commuter on Svc 151, what's your purpose of haranguing the forum over this topic?  If you need to air your grouses, find a more conducive outlet, alright, Straits Times forums or Zaobao forums maybe?<br><br>And I would kindly suggest to you to get some other hobby.  Something more conducive and beneficial for your well being.  Spending time on trivial stuff and a lot of time on the forums isn't beneficial to you.  Maybe you might consider doing a course or something like that to upgrade that brain of yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's face it. SBST has NACs. Choose the lesser of 2 evils. You want them to be deployed on a CBD service like 14??? You'll get more complaints. So put it on a svc where NACs will be appreciated, PARTLY because you pay cheaper fares. Win-win situation for you you also cannot see. Pay less for same destination. What crap on a/c bus stamp. You buy to save $$$ what. Flat fare. Does it make diff whether you save $24 or $28 due to NAC or AC? Don't talk like this. Irritating. Very irritating. I think you are just biased or something against the depots. I don't hear many complaints from others about SBST's NACs.... At least you didn't get SMRT 151. Hispano CAC O405 known to have a/c malfunction, and if suay suay windows sealed, worse right? Not only that, if you like a/c so much, since you have some sort of bus stamp you are mentioning, a/c stamp or something like that, make use of it and make transfers!!! So stupid, never use brain one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why sv151 is still served by NAC buses it's because students [mainly fr NUS] are making a lot of noise of the increased bus fares over the recent years are their unwillingness to pay more for a bus ride to the Uni. <span style="color: red;">THIS IS THE FACT</span>, tt leaves SBST no choice but to deploy slightly more NACs on sv151.<br>btw SBS751S is perm on sv151</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the argument here is distorting certain facts. Some guy says be happy you got reliable MKIIs on 151, hell no man, the MKII is easily one of the most unreliable buses. 3 have broken down on me, hence my faith in MB0405s and LO3X, but not B10Ms.<br><br>Certainly for the post about separate regoes for MKIVs, I found the reply strange. The reply was that CRBs, and MB0405s were also separated, I don't think that's a valid argument because xx, xxx were reserved for AC buses, and if you ask me, I would consider non-AC to be another type altogether.<br><br>Just my thoughts after reading through the last 3 pages.</div>
