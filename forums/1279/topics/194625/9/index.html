Carry like siao on feeder earn little, yet they still get priority for a/c fleet.<br></div></blockquote>Again, it comes down to the bottom line.  Of course the bus operators are going to strategise and make the more highly patronised services fully A/C.  non a/c buses will also consume less fuel, so on the longer haul services, you can get as many journeys out of the one vehicle from one tank of fuel.

The extra fares still add to the profit margine (ie. the bottom line).  I can tell you in no uncertain terms that it will still cost more to run an a/c bus than a non a/c bus.  Simply because of fuel costs, tyre wear, maintenance, etc.  Yes they are longer and carry more pax, but they are heavier and slower than the 2 axle non a/c buses.  They also impact more on the road because of their weight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sick and tired of the stupid NAC MkII on Service 151 story.<br><br>Dear sbst275, you keep on bringing out old wine and trying to recycle the same old grouses again and again like a spoilt record.  Aren't you sick and tired of it?  And sbst275, if you want to air your views, may I suggest STOMP by ST, or Forum pages, or write to SBS Transit.  I think these actions would be more useful than clanging and banging here on the forums  Why come here and create unpleasantness.<br><br>Your part about compassion is <strong>very lame</strong>.  SBS Transit is not running a charitable organisation.  There are stakeholders in every organisation - passengers, staff, shareholders.  No doubt the passenger is an important and major stakeholder, but SBS Transit also needs to account to its shareholders too, so they can't be running at a loss can they?  They have their rationale for deploying the NAC Mk IIs on Service 151.  Why waste perfectly good and operational buses?  Besides, with the circle line going to be ready in 2008, there will be service rationalisations and all that.  The company is already looking forward in their planning in terms of fleet.  I don't think I need to give a word to word explanation on what I think they intend to do.<br><br>Look at SMRT buses, they have to resort to putting CSS registered buses so as to boost their fleet.  Surely, if SBS Transit does away with all the NAC buses now and deploy AC ones now, where are they going to find the extra AC buses?  Take buses from existing services, increase the waiting time for the services, how about withdrawing unprofitable services, rationalise routes etc?  If they do that, you will complain.  So tell me, what should SBS Transit do?  I don't suppose you have the brains or aptitude of management, do you sbst275.<br><br>Anyway we are still lucky that we don't have venerable buses here in Singapore as compared to other cities in the world.<br><br>Also a note, if you don't like the NAC Mk II, don' t take it if you have a choice.  Look for another alternative.  If not Beggars Can't Be Choosers.<br><br>So stop ranting and raving as though you are some madman leader out to oppose.  Enough is enough!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree.  But let him be, I'm happy to spar with this highly educated university student who knows so much about the way things are run in the fine country he lives in.  I already noticed the recurring NAC 151 bus theme, but hey, he keeps replying, so I keep posting.  The more complaints there are, the more I'll produce the facts which will discredit the skewed argument.  Let the argument continue.  If the general enthusiast community thinks that bus services are provided for their convenience, then more of these arguments are going to continue.<br><br>Here's my spin on it all.  Come the completion of the circle line, watch the bus fleets really start to get reduced.  Just watch... you heard it first right here, from me.</div>
