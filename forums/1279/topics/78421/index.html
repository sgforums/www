            <div class='col-md body'>Out you go. Next!!<br><br>On a side note, I wish to re-emphasise that I am not a moderator but I do hope to see more constructive threads in this forum. Suddenly, this forum is becoming a place where people lament, lament, moan, moan about what type of buses they dislike, about which services should have double decker buses and about what buses this and that. I am not sure if anybody else feels the same way I do, but I am getting terribly sick and irritated of reading the same type of threads over and over and over again. I mean, many things are terribly beyond the control of the company themselves. Learn to accept things as they are.<br><br>Yeah, some people are going to say "if you not happy to read, then don't come to the forum". I bet that will be what's going through the minds of some of you when reading this thread. But, do I look as if I care about what you think? If non-constructive comments can be dumped here as threads, why should I be robbed of my right to post what I think should be right for these forum?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I take my hats off to you, delon. May I also tell you that I share the exact sentiments like you do. This forum, though we see a high number of activities, is not like what I've seen when it first started out. It has transformed drastically, but sadly to the negative side. I am sad to see that the professional and matured behaviour and thinking of the forumnites have suddenly become childish and to certain extent, annoys me. There is no problem making jokes, but let's keep them to a certain level. And the flame wars or "Hate Threads" just keep going on and on and on, as evident from this thread itself.<br><br>A bus is a bus. What's the point of making such remarks? What do you stand to gain? I respect each and everyone's likes and dislikes but making such remarks to a bus which does not have a soul of its own just shows how immature we are. <strong>Continuous</strong> complaints, rantings and whinings on simple little things like what delonchew has pointed out is totally unnecessary. Pointing them out once is more than enough for most of us to remember them. It has already happened and will stay that way. There is nothing that we could do to change that. Repeating them time and again just bore others, and that includes me.<br><br>One of our aim is to show to Singapore and everyone else out there that our hobby isn't stupid or childish, yet we ourselves reflects that kind of image. Isn't that ironic?<br><br>I am voicing this out because of the disappointment that I have kept for a very long time. I hope what I said does not invite any hatred to me or any of those who shared the same thoughts as me. But instead, I hope this would in turn improve the image and reputation of SGBuses@SGForums.
