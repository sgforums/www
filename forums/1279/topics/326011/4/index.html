              <p><span style="color: #333333;">How come I see photo of me inside the video without my consent? Why the rest of the bus fans too? Did you ask them for permission? I know it's your photo but why did you take them without our consent on the day and when you're posting up on the internet?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Are you a pervert? Taking photos of us secretly...stalking us when we decided to leave you...kept on calling for minor issues, sometimes just because you wanna meet, what else could I experience? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> If you don't change on disturbing the others, well, I don't recommend new members to give you their numbers as what has happen to me might happen to them, even if they don't mind.

              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Seriously, why can't you let people who ride on a bus with you to be in peace? Talking loudly...take pix of others, disturbs the peace... I doubt that you've controlled yourself since many people talked to you about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Why can't you just let passengers onboard a bus to have a peaceful ride?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Did you ever think of why many people doesn't like or just ignore you when you're present? Did you know that people can get frustrated just because of you?</span></p>

              <p><br>I'm pretty much sure, close to 100%, that you didn't know what exactly happened.</p>
              <p>That photo was taken on the first time SBS 2812L did 157. Me and Mr. ngjy22 took that bus to go to Braddell Road to change another bus, and we have sat there from the time we boarded. Mr. tintinspartan was seated right at the back with some other bus fans.</p>
              <p>We were discussing about bus photos using our cameras when all of a sudden Mr. tintinspartan came beside us, seating at the round red seats (Like those of the bar). So now, if he were to take his camera out and take pictures, how does that make me and Mr. ngjy22 "in his line of fire", when we were seated at that sofa right from the start? Let's put it this way. Both of us had completely no idea at all that he wanted to take a photo of the front. If he had told us, we would have gladly stood up and moved ourselves away because we were about to alight. But if he just snapped away, both of us would be right at the focus of the picture. And what makes me particularly unhappy about it is that he puts it up on cyberspace. Does that sound right? You decide.</p>
              <p>About the photo-taking thing, I shall not bother about him.</p>
              <p>Hope this settles all about what there is to settle. Since tamago has removed the link, I won't bother to pursue the matter anymore.</p>
