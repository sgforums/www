              <p>ultimate today.... waited 27mins for a 858 at 8am+... bus can still bunch with another at Jln Kayu.. BC just slowly chug along at lane 3 at 50kmph.. and no,, theres no traffic jam..</p>
              <p>another time also waited 25mins.. SL tells everyone "Sorry! Next Bus".. Crazy ah.. expect people to wait another 25mins (total up to 50mins) for the next bus<br><br>and in the end after how many months,.. only got a token fine of only $200 for another infamous sv857 (for some incident i cant remember)<br><br>how can they say customer satisfication went up when its hardly improving? esp SMRT bus... until now still no Iris.. SLs drive like no schedule like tt.. makes the frequency so uneven.. </p>

              <p>how to anticipate the demand? wont be so easy.. scheduled at 6mins frequency, just one traffic light and jam at one bus stop will cause the bus to bunch already..</p>
              <p>look at sv70 from YCK at around 8am.. i can saw sv 70 buses departing YCK at around 8am from mon to fri. demand is totally different even for the bus at the same time slot for different days.. for example,on monday,  a SD can be deployed and pax are fully seated only... next day, the SD deployed but the bus full to the door, 3rd day, a DD deployed and also full to the door (upper deck still got some space)...4th day, a DD deployed, but still got space at lower deck... sometime it all depend on the MRT as well.</p>

              <p>yeah.... buses can depart every 10minutes but they will never arrive at bus stops every 10minutes.. thats unavoidable...<br><br>but..TPE  expressway services?? really no excuse for all the inconsistent frequencies just last night, waited 20mins for sv27.. supposedly a service which comes very fast al all times of the day</p>
              <p><br>another irritating thing you see in IRIS:<br>Next Bus: 17mins<br>Sub. Bus: 21mins on a perfectly normal afternoon.. is iris inaccurate or are the frequencies that ridiculous?</p>

              <p>Yes, svc 858 freg had improved a lot during the morning peak. 1 bus jus exit from Yishun Ctrl 2 and another bus enter Yishun Ctrl 2.. =)</p>
              <p>As for 857, I had took it twice ard 11 plus pm during sat nite. 2 857 manage to arrive at yishun. (bef CCL was launch)</p>
              <p>anyway I think that would be a slight drop in ridership for commuters heading to marina area as it is serve by CCL. hope it serve MBS 1 day.</p>

              <p>Observation, SMRT has better frequencies.</p>
              <p>SBST has not improved. Bus bunching problem during peak and even off-peak periods can easily be observed eg Sv 66 and 174.</p>
              <p>SBST buses observed to have longer running time than needed. Most of them tend to drive slower than SMRT buses on the route. But tend to speed up just before reaching interchange to meet scheduled time.</p>

              <p>yeah.... buses can depart every 10minutes but they will never arrive at bus stops every 10minutes.. thats unavoidable...<br><br>but..TPE  expressway services?? really no excuse for all the inconsistent frequencies just last night, waited 20mins for sv27.. supposedly a service which comes very fast al all times of the day</p>
              <p><br>another irritating thing you see in IRIS:<br>Next Bus: 17mins<br>Sub. Bus: 21mins on a perfectly normal afternoon.. is iris inaccurate or are the frequencies that ridiculous?</p>

              <p>For 66 &amp; 174, they're very jam prone at these location. Neither can it pre-empt w/ slightly 'loose schedule'</p>
              <p>66: Woodsville (jam is erratic and kicks in 12pm - 3pm, 6pm - 7pm), Jln Besar, Bt Timah Rd (PM), Dunearn Rd (AM). Raining day it's worst w/ RTA occuring even more frequent than striking TOTO these days) &amp; Jln Jurong Kechil (traffic light timing geela).</p>
              <p>174: Jln Jurong Kechil, Dunearn Rd, Bt Timah Rd, Holland Rd (Sat at times also jam), Orchard Rd.</p>
              <p>Not to say Bt Timah/ Dunearn Rd can be jam prone because of Sixth Ave/ Eng Neo traffic junction. In the 1230 - 1330 timing, 66 can be affected as parents pick up their kids at SCGS creating massive jam.</p>
              <p>It's better to plan for a longer running time in general as there would always be roadworks, adhoc events, raining days. Not to mention some bus stops needs longer turnaround time or the bus loading.</p>
              <p>There's case tat SMRT buses can be 1 hr behind schedule if there's rain.</p>

              <p>Correct..... But buses around my area used to have 20min frequencies. Now like 10mins? At least SBST is doing something to improve frequencies. So many Scanias , must make use of them mah :)</p>

              <p>ultimate today.... waited 27mins for a 858 at 8am+... bus can
                  still bunch with another at Jln Kayu.. BC just slowly chug along at
                  lane 3 at 50kmph.. and no,, theres no traffic jam..</p>
              <p>another time also waited 25mins.. SL tells everyone "Sorry! Next
                  Bus".. Crazy ah.. expect people to wait another 25mins (total up to
                  50mins) for the next bus<br> <br> and in the end after how many months,.. only got a token fine of
                  only $200 for another infamous sv857 (for some incident i cant
                  remember)<br> <br> how can they say customer satisfication went up when its hardly
                  improving? esp SMRT bus... until now still no Iris.. SLs drive like
                  no schedule like tt.. makes the frequency so uneven.. </p>

              <p>Very few people will wait for 858 at Jalan Kayu during AM peak hours.... Reason being most buses will be filled by the time they leave Khatib.</p>
              <p>I think most people can agree with me frequencies for all airport services are terrible during off peak hours.</p>

              <p>From all these observed cases of irregular frequencies of services, bus breakdown on the road, bus breakdown at interchanges, shortage of bus captains during morning and afternoon despatching, and at times shortage of buses and etc ...... just wonder how SMRT and SBST can really said to be able to meet the QoS.</p>
