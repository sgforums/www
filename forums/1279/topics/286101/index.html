            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, the vehicle population is surging at an exponential speed due to whatever reasons. Given the major constraint that Singapore has limited land space with almost every inch is preciously utilised up to its fullesy by the authorities, there is a limit which the roads can be widened.<br>Can we widen the roads to accommodate the surging vehicle demand? Will it be fast enough?<br><br>With surging vehicle population, it can be frustuating at times for vehicles including buses to stop and go, for every few seconds. At that kind of frustuating situation, will anybody think of giving way to buses?<br><br>At times, bus drivers drive slowly as they are ahead of schedule. They are trying to be on schedule. At times, they have switch to the centre lane due to unforeseen circumstances such as obstacles on the road or traffic just simply moves too slowly. The fact that more buses have switched to centre lane indicates that general traffic on the roads is slower now as compared to the past.<br><br>So how? I can only say that avoid congested areas and encourage more people to utilise public transport.</div>
