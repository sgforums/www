            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry ^tamago^ but i find ur list very hard to believe, but i give u the benefit of the doubt as i havent went to the toilet alley recently.<br><br>Firstly, it is IMPOSSIBLE for svc 806 with 15mins route time to get 6 buses, and service 804 with 30mins route time to get 9 buses. Whats more, 575 , 812 , 816 are perm on 804 now and will still be<br><br>Next alot of ur svc 171 buses hopped over to the other yishun trunk services, but considering the fact tt 171 0405 OACs have the route posters, TIBS would not shuffle them too much unless they got too much $$ to spare on advertising. 171 also have too few perm buses to begin with, as its fleet is rather stable, esp the 0405s.<br><br>It is also unlikely for 852 to be a full Lance fleet, however much you may like it to be. As far as possible, for AMKDEP in concern, they like to mix some models in for trunk services so as to increase reliability. It would be extremely hard for TIBS to make a svc fully Lance, like there were times where most of the fleet was grounded after the 1004K incident for emergency checks.<br><br>Lastly, i will like to clear up the air abt bendies on 804. These bendies follow the 804A route and only enter service in ONE direction twds the interchange from blk 356, yishunn ring rd,....AND...the buses are normally 1164 and 1176, NOT 1163 as most of u all believe.<br></div>

TIBS closing down KJDEP ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>TIBS drivers are FIXED to a BUS, NOT the other way round. this is normally how TIBS operate their bus services. They are not fixed to a route, like some Lances cross over to 969 sometimes with an 855 driver. Rather, they cross routes like AMK's cameo king , TIB819M<br><br>BTW, U shd visit Yisun more often. In the case for svc 804 and 806, the split shift is from 12pm to 3pm, NOT during the peak hours or the Bendy on 804 will get stuck in the U-turn, and the 806 12m bus will probably explode.<br><br>Feeder service drivers go on trunk, NOT trunk on feeder for god's sake. Svc 806 bendies with their drivers regularly go over to svc 854 during the non-peak. Even if they do, they cross over for the whole day.<br><br>Next, the code for trunk drivers AND feeder is 8??AMXX or 8??PMXX.....i must really compliment u for ur vivid imagination and perhaps ur under-corrected eyesight<br><br>It is true tt the buses need rest, but once in two months wont really warrant it as perm, won't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
