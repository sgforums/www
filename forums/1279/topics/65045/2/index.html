Any other forumers who had seen the DAF, pls help...thx!<br><br>I have a gut feeling that the DAF that u may had seen may be mistaken as an 0405, especially if u view if without the very distinctive front. However, i must admit that there are a few special instances when a bus hops depots on TIBS, unlike on SBST where it is very common.<br><br>Secondly, i would like to clarify the location of the toilet alley in Yishun. That times when i went down and check, the work calenders are not posted on the notice board, but rather in the controller's office.'<br><br>TIBS try to maintain a same bus, same route for all drivers, but there are times when there are operational constraints. Then bus that u are referring to switching duties on 804 and 852 is TIB1011U that day, and i got a photo of it. You may like to know that the bus is on the route for the whole day for that day. If you have contacts that saw the Lance on 804, please also include the rego in ur posts; its much clearer, and it is the ONLY way that u will know that it had switched services during the day.<br><br>Next, the TQ and S shifts are considered very special class of shifts, and arise due to the TIBS CHC charter as they have insufficient buses. The S shift drivers dun end their shift at 8pm, or 12pm on weekdays; they have another charter duty to do,if u dun believe me, you may like to check out the CHC schedules if u like; they match logically.<br><br>I have to agree with you that there are extrodinarily many buses during Christmas Eve and the day itself. However, if you had observed the entire day, u would had seen that most of the extra ones knock off at almost the same time; it is easily mistaken for a TQ or S shift; in fact, they are off to Jurong on a CHC charter. Most of the CHC charter buses originate from AMK, esp on svc 851, and TIB1201M has a perm AM shift only for that matter on saturdays. It is also rather hard to wait for a bus on 851 and 852 for the same reason on Friday evenings.<br><br></div>

I was quite pissed off when u stated a lot of errors on the yishun trunk service, esp 800, 804 and 806.<br><br>For that reason, i also have some reason to believe that u had started to collect regos for quite some time, as the last time that 1232 and 1200 had appeared on 806 is at least 1 month ago, and 812, 816 and 575 at least stayed on 804 for at least the past 2 months. It is very very rare to get a 12m on 806 nowadays due to the high load........only 756 and 945 appeared last week on 806.<br>Moreover, there are no bendies perm on 804. Hence, i thought u are falsifying info.<br><br>Given that TIBS currently have insufficient buses, it is very easy to see if the bus is perm on the service........One does not need to care about AM and PM shift...that is the driver's business. If the shift is S, chances are that it is a "cameo". A perm bus on TIBS is normally seen throughout the day, its just driven by different drivers.<br><br>TQ shifts are not fixed from 8 to 8. For example, svc 806 drivers can drive the bus the entire day from 0600 to 2200. Their shift timetable is still AM/PM, only that the same driver change timetables. 50% of 806 buses knock off after 8pm, but all go into service at 0600 to meet the student demand.<br><br>As for myself, im sorry to say that i can't exchange regos and info with you for past deployments, and i dun care to take down regos as they are too much of a hassle. For that matter, my rego list comes from experience, so its easier to spot cameos.<br><br>For example, the fleet in 1999-2000:<br>800: 816, 818 , both of which are ceded to 804 after it started to operate bendies.; 970 which was the envy of many feeder services.<br>804: 815, 495, now x-fer depot to WLDEP, and perm on svc 969; not sure abt 815 though, but i dun see it in Yishun these days.<br>780 when NAC, was on 804, pending fitting of AC was transferred to 851, and also shares its time with 852.
