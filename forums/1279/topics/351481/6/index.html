              <p>longer journey time = more buses need for same peak frequency as before. there needs to be a balance between route coverage and journey time, especially when the demand of 241 is mainly not at st 62 which now has 243.</p>

              do you actually think 241 has buses to spare? it's not like the whole world of pioneer are going to jurong east! but surely additional trips on sv99 will come in if ever the bus is close to exceeding its loading capacity.

              <p>the current 241 i'm talking about includes all trips run as 241 including x-overs from 179. do you really think they still can squeeze a bus out of this pool to do 99? i think they'd rather do 241 and add buses on sv99 if it really needs one.
              <br><br>
              why are u harping on JB Mark III's doing sv99? are they that bad or does bbdep not have enough spares? add a perm slot and the service will have a new perm bus, simple as that.
              <br><br>
              let's see what you have proposed....</p>
              
              <blockquote>
                <div class="quote_from">

              <p>
              Demand 99 to be 2 to 6 mins during AM &amp; PM peak.
              Furthermore, 179 &amp; 242 had their frequency ard less den 1 min
              to longest 4 mins during PEAK time. They need 99 to go 'down' lik
              Boon Lay Ave, The Strategy &amp; Clementi there.</p>
              <p>Timings for both 241/99 AM-peak crossovers I expect to have:</p>
              <p>7.30am, 7.40am (Do 1 downtrip from Densed JW Street 91 to
              Clementi Int)</p>
              <p>As this is the timings that commuters are going destination to
              work &amp; give convenience.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>after 7.35am when all the supplementary trips from 179 have already done their last trips, the headway of 241 will increase from 4 minutes to 6 minutes.
              <br><br>
              if u try to remove 2 perm buses out of 241, the headway will increase from 6 minutes to 10 minutes.
              <br><br>
              now, what the heck? you want the frequency of sv99 to be even better than sv241 which connect residents to much more places than just jurong east and clementi? that's either outright biasness or you have no idea how the 179/241 trips work.
              <br><br>
              why should I impact the frequency of 241 so severely to supplement another service which does not have severe loading issues anyway?
              <br><br>
              and should they ever do service 99, by the time they return to Boon Lay, it's their mealbreak. this will guarantee you 10-minute headway on a Neighbourhood 9 feeder service (whose demand you know best) all the way up to after 11am.
              <br><br>
              If you want to run downroutes on service 99, please just add another S shift to sv99 and improve the headway. it'll do much more than running 2 downroutes unless you're intending to add 2 buses on 241, on top of what we have now.</p>

              <p>I really don't know what's your fascination with downroutes if the buses have to travel from Clementi Int anyway. Why not just improve the headway throughout the whole trip? Do you know SWT's and downroutes can only be slotted in-between full trips scheduled at regular intervals, and are only meant to supplement these regular trips, not replace them?
              <br><br>SWT's are only scheduled at places with exceptionally high activity such that regular trips cannot cope with the demand. It's not like your chaffeur, with 2-minute frequencies from JW St 91 to Clementi at that time just because you want to go to work.
              <br><br>And SWT's are most disruptive because of the tradeoff because some passengers will not be able to go where they want to (imagine people wanting to go to JW St 91 from Clementi yet you took away their bus instead of giving a 2-min bump in the headway for the entire route in that time period), and running empty buses from the ending point to the starting point is actually fuel-inefficient.
              <br><br>As for the 99/556 crossover, there is no point talking about it.... especially when Service 99 does have less than 10-min headway and does not have any siginificant loading issues. For these 2 reasons, there is no need to waste buses just to spam your Service 99 when there are other services that might need the buses to run 10-min peak headway.</p>
