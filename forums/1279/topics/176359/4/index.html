I think bus enthusiasts and some other people who are doing projects will be glad to have this alternative. BTW, CAAS also has a link where someone can register before taking photos of Changi Airport.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, if i ever take any bus photos, it's mostly on the technical aspects of the bus like the dashboard, axle hubs, bodywork design along these lines.<br>I won't be too interested in the surroundings around the bus like the buildings or staff etc. !<br><br>I'll say what the bus operators can do (to cater to the interests of the bus community) is also to keep a list of regularly interested people on buses (aren't too many here so should not be a drain on resources to maintain ?!) &amp; invite these lot whenever they launch any new bus model (which does not happen too often) so that all the photo/video taking can be convinently done with in just 1 event even within 1 day &amp; they are spared the 'anxieties' later of suspicious people trying to take photos every now &amp; then later anywhere else !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS9818A:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, you may do what is mentioned in the first para by all means.
