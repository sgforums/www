              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Overcrowded trains are a common complaint of many 
                  commuters these days.
                  <br> <br> And transport operator SMRT said it will introduce more bus services to 
                  run parallel to some sections of the train lines to alleviate the 
                  congestion.
                  <br> <br> While ridership in trains used to increase 1 to 2 per cent annually, it 
                  has risen by as much as 9 per cent in recent years.
                  <br> <br> So SMRT said it is sparing no expense to find ways to ease the load.
                  <br> <br> Saw Phaik Hwa, CEO, SMRT, said: "What we have done is every week, and 
                  I'm talking about every week, not year, we are adding 1,110 train rides 
                  already. As late as March and April, we added another 150 rides."
                  <br> <br> SMRT will also increase the number of bus services that run parallel to 
                  MRT lines to give commuters more alternatives to joining the daily 
                  squeeze.
                  <br> <br> The operator is also looking to ease crowds by end-2011, when 22 more 
                  trains will be added.
                  <br> <br> An extra platform to the Jurong East interchange will also reduce 
                  waiting time there during peak hours - from the current 3 to 4 minutes, 
                  to the minimum possible two minutes.
                  <br> <br> Ms Saw also responded to the online uproar over a comment she had made 
                  recently. She had said commuters could choose not to enter crowded 
                  trains, prompting netizens to argue she did not understand what 
                  commuters were going through. 
                  <br> <br> She said: "I am very aware it's crowded. I take the trains all the time.
                   I take the effort to go all the way to the northern towns to see how 
                  crowded it is during the morning peaks and I take the train with the 
                  people. 
                  <br> <br> "It is crowded, but I push my way in. It is crowded, but when they are 
                  already running at 2-3 minutes (intervals), it's the most that I can do.
                   I cannot go faster than that without compromising safety and 
                  reliability."
                  <br> <br> At the peak hours, some four people are packed in one square metre of 
                  space. 
                  <br> <br> Commuters agree that things could be much worse.
                  <br> <br> "In other countries the squeezing situation is much worse. I mean, for 
                  example in Japan, where they are squeezed like Sardines," one commuter 
                  said.
                  <br> <br> With trains pushed to the limit, it looks like commuters will have to 
                  bear with the squeeze for now - until more lines are opened up to spread
                   out the passenger load.
                  <br> <br> You can read more on the story in Saturday's edition of the TODAY

              <p>Running services parallel to MRT will not work effectively if they cover almost all the MRT stops along the way and make it very long winded. For the tired office worker after 8 or 9 hours in the office, the first thing they would want is a quick journey home for dinner + rest.</p>
              <p>I reckon they should introduce more direct services from town to other parts of Singapore and not make them turn huge rounds here and there. The way it is now only a very small handful of services (not talking about Express and Premiums) take a very direct route to town. And those are the services customers will choose over the MRT if they prove to be faster back to the heartlands.</p>

              <p>From TodayOnline.com</p>
              <p><strong>SMRT has a plan ...<br>Buses could be run parallel to MRT lines in bid to alleviate overcrowding</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Public transport operator SMRT is in discussions with the Government to roll out peak-hour bus services which would run parallel to congested stretches of MRT train lines.</p>
              <p>This is one alternative SMRT is exploring, chief executive Saw Phaik Hwa told MediaCorp, as trains are running at their highest frequency possible - given the train network's design - during peak hours.</p>
              <p>Currently, there is one bus, Service 128, which runs parallel to parts of the North-South Line. "We're looking at other parts to see whether it can work," said Ms Saw, who declined to reveal where or the number of possible services, due to the discussions with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Public Transport Council.</p>
              <p>Introduced in July 2008, Service 128 was the first in 18 years to be allowed to run parallel to an MRT line since such services were scrapped.</p>
              <p>While transport policy has focused on avoiding duplicate bus and train routes, Member of Parliament Ong Kian Min felt SMRT's plan should be studied further. "The number of trains are limited by capacity and infrastructure. Buses, on the other hand, can provide more flexibility in tackling congestion on trains," said Mr Ong, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for transport.</p>
              <p>But a potential speedbump to this plan could be commuters' preference to travel by train. SMRT has been monitoring commuters' responses to Service 128 and found that most passengers prefer to wait another few minutes for the next train rather than take the bus.</p>
              <p>"So customers have not really supported the alternative ... We'll continue to explore this," said Ms Saw.</p>
              <p>She was speaking to MediaCorp on Friday, almost a week after her comments about train loads and congestion prompted irate responses on the Internet.</p>
              <p>While she acknowledged trains here are crowded, especially during peak periods, Ms Saw pointed out that the average number of passengers per square metre is lower than that of metros in other major cities.</p>
              <p>At a frequency of two to three minutes, SMRT train loads range from 1,200 to 1,450 passengers, or an average of 3.8 passengers per square metre. In the likes of London, Shanghai and Tokyo, it is five to eight passengers per square metre, according to SMRT.</p>
              <p>LTA guidelines, meanwhile, stipulate a maximum loading standard of 1,600 passengers per train, or about 4.9 passengers per square metre.</p>
              <p>SMRT said its trains are already pushing optimal levels when trains run at intervals of two minutes.</p>
              <p>"You may add a few more (trains) here and there, but we have to watch it because every time you add a train, you're risking a train not being maintained," Ms Saw said.</p>
              <p>Maintenance schedules have been tweaked to allow for "as many trains as possible" to be utilised, while not compromising safety and reliability, she added.</p>
              <p>At the Jurong East interchange station, crowdedness "is a problem" due to constraints of the system's design, said SMRT.</p>
              <p>LTA is undertaking infrastructural works at the station, due to be completed next year. Together with 22 new trains which will be put into service progressively from next May, SMRT will then be able to add more train trips.</p>
              <p>Until then, SMRT will explore options such as parallel bus services to ease congestion.</p>
              <p>While the new Circle Line has alleviated congestion "to some extent" - by a few single-digit percentage points - Ms Saw said it may also add congestion at some stations.</p>
              <p>Bishan Station, for example, is one such "pressure point", as it serves both the North-South and Circle Lines. "Eventually, the more it (Circle Line) crosses the lines that are affected, there will be some impact," Ms Saw said.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              I don't think express bus lane on expressway will work as sg got too many entry/exit slip roads within a short span of distance. I think ERP will work better to help ease congestion. LTA should draw more yellow boxes at bus-stops to allow easier exit from bus bays.
              
              I think a bus service that runs mainly parallel to MRT lines may fail as it still makes sense to skip a few crowded trains during the peak, whereas the bus may be stuck in traffic jam and has to stop at bus-stops. And even with a bus service that runs mainly parallel to MRT lines, this service is probably better utilised during the peak and the demand is likely to be bad during off-peak. Perhaps a better solution is more express services during the peak, and express services should NOT be limited to go to the CBD only. I hope to see more bus services to other parts of the country. for eg; direct svcs from Sengkang/Punggol/Hougang/Ferrnvale to Sembawang/WDL/Jurong/Bt Panjang?
