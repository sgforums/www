              <p>Although we are moving towards the era of having more and more services at interchanges, my personal view is that the older 1980s system of dual interchange/terminal is more effective in some towns.</p>
              <p>Let me give an example with Yishun New Town:</p>
              <p>Instead of the current 1 large interchange concept, 2 additional terminals (1 around yishun industrial area, and 1 around khatib/orchid country club area) could be used to reduce reliance on feeder services and reduce traffic flow into the interchange.</p>
              <p>Services heading south and east bound (e.g. 851-5, 39, 85, etc) could begin from the industrial area and travel along Ave 2 and pax living along the route no longer need to make a transfer into and out of the interchange.</p>
              <p>Services heading west and north towards woodlands can begin from the area around country club, passing through khatib before continuing via chong pang and gambas.</p>
              <p>This will reduce the interchange at yishun to mostly passengers transferring from MRT and travelling around yishun itself, and those areas not covered by these routes. As you already may know, it takes at least 10mins additional travel time to go into the interchange and out of it, not even taking into account of the bus waiting time.</p>
              <p>If you still need to transfer, that is still possible by transferring at the key stops outside yishun mrt/int or any other stops that the services intersect at.</p>
              <p>A better town for all?</p>

              <p>Bidadari need big interchange to cater to 11000 housing units ? There are so many bus services passing by n a mrt station right at door step.Â </p>

              <p>In my opinion, I think the bus interchange at Tengah will be smaller than the ones at Bidadari, Woodlands North and Tampines North, because there will be Jurong Region Line going through Tengah, which would reduce the need for buses.</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, the boarding berths at Eunos Bus Interchange are not fully occupied, which could mean there may be parking lots that are not utilised.</p>
              <p>Today, there are only seven bus services at the Eunos Bus Interchange. According to <a href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/eunos-bus-interchange/">Public Transport SG</a>, there are thirty parking lots and four sawtooth berths, which means the Eunos Bus Interchange has the capacity for around fifteen bus services. The Eunos Bus Interchange can contain around eight more bus services.</p>
              <p>I suppose LTA intends to use Eunos Bus Interchange as a complementary to Bedok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Two benefits:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>- Divert traffic, so roads would not be congested.</li>
              <li>- Optimise resources. Since currently there is space at Eunos Bus Interchange, there may not be a need to oversupply parking lots at Bedok Bus Interchange.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Personally, I feel that if we were to shorten the Bedok-bound routes (7, 26, 30 and 30E) that ply Sims Avenue to terminate at Eunos Bus Interchange, Bedok Bus Interchange would be able to contain new bus services.</p>
              <p>Likewise, at Tampines Bus Interchange, we could divert some services to Eunos Bus Interchange (28 and 67) to empty parking lots for new bus services.</p>

              <p>Just wondering. When the operations at the temporary Bedok Bus Interchange moves to the new Bedok Bus Interchange, can we re-name "Bedok Temporary Bus Interchange" to "Bedok Bus Interchange 2" and use it as a complementary to Bedok Bus Interchange?</p>
              <p>This is similar to the Spongebob Squarepants movie, where Mr Krabs opened the "Krusty Krab 2" restaurant right next to the original "Krusty Krab" restaurant.

              <p>But then hor, if we have more bus services at Bedok Bus Interchange, will the surrounding infrastructure (roads and MRT) be able to cope with the increase in traffic?</p>

              <p>In the first place, do you think that the Bedok Temporary Bus Interchange will still be in operation after the air-conditioned bus interchange opened? This is a complete different case from the example you showed in your second paragraph in which the first restaurant is still in operation after the second restaurant opened. So no, I don't think it should be renamed.</p>

              <p>Do not need a big interchange only for Bidadari... but services can start here considering Serangoon interchange is so small... Serangoon has fewer units as well.. maybe that is why the interchange is small.. and today if they want to introduce new services to city, west or east... they cannot do from Serangoon anymore..</p>
              <p>Have to loop 81/82 as well.. due to space constraint..Â </p>

              <p>Meanwhile, the boarding berths at Eunos Bus Interchange are not
              fully occupied, which could mean there may be parking lots that are
              not utilised.</p>
              <p>Today, there are only seven bus services at the Eunos Bus
              Interchange. According to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/eunos-bus-interchange/">Public Transport SG</a>, there are thirty parking
              lots and four sawtooth berths, which means the Eunos Bus
              Interchange has the capacity for around fifteen bus services. The
              Eunos Bus Interchange can contain around eight more bus
              services.</p>
              <p>I suppose LTA intends to use Eunos Bus Interchange as a
              complementary to Bedok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Two benefits:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>- Divert traffic, so roads would not be congested.</li>
              <li>- Optimise resources. Since currently there is space at Eunos
              Bus Interchange, there may not be a need to oversupply parking lots
              at Bedok Bus Interchange.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Personally, I feel that if we were to shorten the Bedok-bound
              routes (7, 26, 30 and 30E) that ply Sims Avenue to terminate at
              Eunos Bus Interchange, Bedok Bus Interchange would be able to
              contain new bus services.</p>
              <p>Likewise, at Tampines Bus Interchange, we could divert some
              services to Eunos Bus Interchange (28 and 67) to empty parking lots
              for new bus services.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I would say each service should have 3 parking lots dedicated... especially those that loop and are long distance.. hence, would say 10-11 services max.</p>

              <p>Although we are moving towards the era of having more and more
              services at interchanges, my personal view is that the older 1980s
              system of dual interchange/terminal is more effective in some
              towns.</p>
              <p>Let me give an example with Yishun New Town:</p>
              <p>Instead of the current 1 large interchange concept, 2 additional
              terminals (1 around yishun industrial area, and 1 around
              khatib/orchid country club area) could be used to reduce reliance
              on feeder services and reduce traffic flow into the
              interchange.</p>
              <p>Services heading south and east bound (e.g. 851-5, 39, 85, etc)
              could begin from the industrial area and travel along Ave 2 and pax
              living along the route no longer need to make a transfer into and
              out of the interchange.</p>
              <p>Services heading west and north towards woodlands can begin from
              the area around country club, passing through khatib before
              continuing via chong pang and gambas.</p>
              <p>This will reduce the interchange at yishun to mostly passengers
              transferring from MRT and travelling around yishun itself, and
              those areas not covered by these routes. As you already may know,
              it takes at least 10mins additional travel time to go into the
              interchange and out of it, not even taking into account of the bus
              waiting time.</p>
              <p>If you still need to transfer, that is still possible by
              transferring at the key stops outside yishun mrt/int or any other
              stops that the services intersect at.</p>

              <p>I do agree that it would be good to have an interchange and another terminal within town. Having just one interchange for big towns is quite inconvenient and time consuming for ppl.Â </p>
              <p>There need to be trunk services plying huge housing complexes along Yishun ring road, Yishun ave 4/6/11. At least one trunk service rather than everyone taking feeder to interchange to change.Â </p>
              <p>This is what is putting heavy peak hour pressure on both feeder services as well as MRT.Â </p>

              <p>Just wondering. When the operations at the temporary Bedok Bus
              Interchange moves to the new Bedok Bus Interchange, can we re-name
              "Bedok Temporary Bus Interchange" to "Bedok Bus Interchange 2" and
              use it as a complementary to Bedok Bus Interchange?</p>
              <p>This is similar to the Spongebob Squarepants movie, where Mr
              Krabs opened the "Krusty Krab 2" restaurant right next to the
              original "Krusty Krab" restaurant. If we use the temporary facility
              as "Bedok Bus Interchange 2", there will be space for new bus
              services at Bedok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>But then hor, if we have more bus services at Bedok Bus
              Interchange, will the surrounding infrastructure (roads and MRT) be
              able to cope with the increase in traffic?</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, this will never happen. The temp facility is always demolished after the main one is up. Cheers.</p>

              Toa Payoh is the best for AC int..Got e space etc..
              Hopes a few upcoming AC Int like Yishun or Hougang is as big as Toa Payoh if not bigger.
              Taman Jurong should built a proper terminal for 3-5 svc.
              Yew Tee need a bus terminal..Marsiling too.
              Upp East Coast actually no need but Marine Parade really need one.
              Saint Michael stays as is it,Bishan need a new bigger Int which can accomodate at least 12 Svc.Yio Chu Kang dunno what to say already..Sembawang need proper Int for future development.Changi Cargo Cplx also can built a small terminal for Svc like 89/89e and future new svc from elsewhere.

              <p>Maybe can build some new interchanges/terminals along TEL? For eg: Lentor can be a good candidate. Mayflower / Sing Ming / Upper Thomson will have space issue.Â </p>
              <p>Caldecott can also try having small interchange.</p>

              <p>That's becoz TPY is the first AC int when HDB kickstarted housing and town development, and before the white paper existed. Combining these reasons together it makes sense to say that TPY is bigger than the rest as the urgency for optimum space usage is still not there. Thus the large number of end-on lots and two completely separate wings for the int.Â </p>
