              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, this is true only for now. But govt has already released plans that punggol will be the biggest town in terms of household population, not area. This has already been made well known and by 2020, it will beat tampines, woodlands, Ang mo kio, jurong and all other towns too. </p>
              <p>This is nothing to crow about. What is more important is the infrastructure and the amenities and facilities. Imagine all the flats are so near each other and this densely packed situation is going to make people fed up. What people actually want is not the highest household population in their town. What we want is a comfortable and convenient way of living. Cheers!</p>

              <p><br> Maybe it is only around year 2020 when Punggol would have a population higher than all other towns because according to PM Lee in his National Day Rally Speech this year, some industrial areas in Jurong will be re-developed for housing in future when the leases at the industrial areas expire in 20 to 30 years.</p>
              <p>By around 2039, Jurong may have the largest population in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, that is Jurong West and Jurong East combined together. If it's only one town, I think Punggol would be the one that has the highest population.</p>

              <p>Jurong West / Jurong East has very good infrastructure, and the planning has been good. It is not very congested unlike Punggol plans.</p>
              <p>Jurong has good mix of commercial complex, hospitals, malls / entertainment, parks, condominiums, MRT links, bus interchanges, many trunk/express/feeder services and huge HDBs.</p>
              <p>Punggol on the other hand seems only being developed for residential - HDBs and HDBs with few sporadic condos. Just NEL for now which is already bursting.. and only one interchange announced. Space is so small compared to Jurong but will be the biggest town in terms of population.</p>
              <p>Also hoping they will have more trunk services without all of them having to go through Sengkang/Hougang.</p>

They usually open during the school holiday unlike the serangoon bus interchange which opened around september! I as a bedok resident just can't wait for the opening of the interchange.does anyone know Why bus service 854 is not stated on the lta website when they release the news on the interchange? I hope 854 is in operation Cause I always take that bus to my grandma house at yishun.... :(</p></div>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, this is true only for now. But govt has
                      already released plans that punggol will be the biggest town in
                      terms of household population, not area. This has already been made
                      well known and by 2020, it will beat tampines, woodlands, Ang mo
                      kio, jurong and all other towns too. </p>
              <p>This is nothing to crow about. What is more important is the
                      infrastructure and the amenities and facilities. Imagine all the
                      flats are so near each other and this densely packed situation is
                      going to make people fed up. What people actually want is not the
                      highest household population in their town. What we want is a
                      comfortable and convenient way of living. Cheers!</p>

              <p>No choice, this is Singapore. If you wanted comfortable and convenient, buy private houses. The newer flats are built for small families, and are designed for physical disabilities. For this, it is done very well. The older flats remain the same, but this is the new style now.</p>

              <p>Hi mr GaryG, I think you missed the gist of the issue. Is not a differentiation between HDB flats and private houses. Is a differentiation between HDB estates in different towns. Oops, I think HDB flats are the best. It is just some HDB in some estates are more comfortable and convenient than other HDB flats in other towns. Even in the same estate, some flats are more conveniently located than other flats. Cheers. </p>
