              <p>Yes... long queue can be seen entering interchange... most ppl now will avoid taking these services terminating at interchange (if have an option) and choose service where you can alight directly near Bedok MRT... meaning increasing boarding/alighting time at bus stops... causing traffic jams on main road as well. </p>
              <p>Hopefully, they will make some modifications to the traffic signals there to ease.</p>

              <p>17,60,87,225 and 229 should travel via Nth St 1 on return trip to Int. Must understand, the stretch between the exit and entrance have so much traffic. IIRC, Boon Lay entrance/exit is the same traffic light.</p>
              <p>Also, old Int have one more entrance. so not too surprised that jam until so bad. But jam until a few hundred metres from Chai Chee Technopark? Something wrong liao.</p>

                  we are talking of half height glass panels like Sengkang Int. meaning the wall below can be made of reinforced concrete wall. with additional rows of bollards outside it should act as double layer protection. with glass panels; at least we can see what is going on outside and if anything happens, pax still can quickly siam. if opaque wall; pax will all gong gong stand there and totally unable to react. take the recent incident where a taxi crashed into the bus stop. imagine a wall separating the busstop and road. if taxi crashes, will the ppl at the bus stop able to react at all?

              if i'm not wrong, the architect simply copied BNL int layout. but they failed to realise BNL got additional entry/exit point beside for the end berths. they failed to consider the no. of bus sv for Bedok int, the BSEP additional buses, the limited no. of alighting berths, the narrow 2lane at entry point+buses turning out from parking lots all add to the congestion. in typical construction projects; the project team usually conduct site meetings every 2 weeks to review the design,work progress etc. so i am very surprised despite so many meetings and review; nobody in the project team realised the design fault. worse still; LTA and PTO are supposed to send experienced officials oversee the works just like all typical govt projects. yet such things happen. everything is already built. so how to improve the situation now? bus schedules all got screwed up.

              <p><br> if i'm not wrong, the architect simply copied BNL int layout. but
                      they failed to realise BNL got additional entry/exit point beside
                      for the end berths. they failed to consider the no. of bus sv for
                      Bedok int, the BSEP additional buses, the limited no. of alighting
                      berths, the narrow 2lane at entry point+buses turning out from
                      parking lots all add to the congestion. in typical construction
                      projects; the project team usually conduct site meetings every 2
                      weeks to review the design,work progress etc. so i am very
                      surprised despite so many meetings and review; nobody in the
                      project team realised the design fault. worse still; LTA and PTO
                      are supposed to send experienced officials oversee the works just
                      like all typical govt projects. yet such things happen. everything
                      is already built. so how to improve the situation now? bus
                      schedules all got screwed up.</p>

              <p>If they purposely designed the interchange like this, they should not even close the temporary int in the first place and make it as an expanded bus park cum alighting bays for 7/25/854/401/etc only... <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Like that BCs no need to waste the fking time stucked in the unneccessary jam...</span></p>
              <p>Or best of all, the temp int can be used for 7/25/854/401/etc, with upgrading half the section to an aircon int while in operation, and another half once the first half have converted to aircon... Like this, we can be sure this is the best Bedok Bus Int with minimal jam... And the 14/168/etc side can remain at the current new int under the shopping mall... This will confirm ease the traffic condition from BNL permanent jam during peak... <br>With the amount of spare parking lots, spare buses or even BSEP can park inside for the rest of the day bef operation...</p>

              <p>Layout wise, isn't the layout of the new bus interchange the same as the temporary bus interchange? If the layout is the same and operations was okay in the temporary bus interchange, then layout is not the issue.</p>
              <p>From the comments here, it seems that the issue is with the traffic flow.</p>
              <p>Possible adjustment:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>I notice there are eight bus services coming in from blk204 side, while there are twenty two bus services coming in from blk35/37/40 side. (reference: <a href="https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sbst_bedok1.png">https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sbst_bedok1.png</a> &amp; <a href="https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/smrt_bedok.png">https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/smrt_bedok.png</a>). There are more buses coming in from blk35/37/40 side than from blk204 side. LTA can consider re-routing some routes (eg. 225G) at the more congested side to enter from the other side (from blk204) which has less bus services using; <strong>balance the number of bus services coming in from each side</strong>.</li>

              <p>Personally, I do not like end-on berths. From my experience taking 198, 174, 30 to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, buses at end-on berths usually waste a lot of time at the return journey looking for empty end-on berth to park.</p>
              <p>Not to mention the usual traffic congestions at Boon Lay Way/Jurong West Central 2 junction - that can be solved by re-routing some routes (from Jurong Fire Station side and industrial estate side) to use Jalan Boon Lay and Jurong West Central 3 to return to Boon Lay Bus Interchange - which may make the situation worse if the traffic is improved.</p>
              <p>(improvement in traffic flow into end-on berths at Boon Lay Bus Interchange = more buses waiting for end-on berths to park = more time wasted)</p>
              <p>So, be glad that Bedok Bus Interchange does not have end-on berths, because if there are, things could be worse.</p>
              <p>I think the congestion issues at Bedok Bus Interchange can be solved by simply balancing the number of bus services entering/exiting Bedok Bus Interchange from each side. </p>
              <p>Balance the number of bus services coming in/coming out from each side, and I think everything would be perfect already. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
