              <p>lta and hdb should bulid one like toa payoh with mrt station and town centre and office  intergatered to together. Most air-con interchanges have condos and shopping centre build on top and at the side of the interchange squeeze into land space that is small and is poorly plan. the developer make the cost of the land space value higher to earn more money from buyers of condos and make the shops rent higher and your eating and shopping more expensive.</p>
              <p>Bedok air-con new interchange shopping centre things and foods will be no different. i wonder why the MP there must push for the development of the air-con interchange and shopping and condo, when the cost living is already expensive? A modern air-con interchange with MRT station link to town centre shops will do. I think bedok town centre shops will die slowly like toa paoyh and clementi town centre soon. rent is going to be expensive. </p>

              <p>Hi mr wsy1234, shopping centre already started building. It is on the way to completion by next yr end. Aircon bus interchange with shopping centre is not on the cards yet. The hawker centre together with the town centre is already conceptualised and location is at big field near the fo guang Shan. But not yet started soil ceremony. Along those LRT stations in Punggol east line, there is no available site anymore. Most are given to flats. For damai LRT, it is within walking distance to the mrt hawker centre in planning near fo guang Shan. For oasis LRT, they are already building a new shopping mall soon. For most flats in Punggol, they will have LRT either at doorstep or within walking distance. For those not reachable by LRT, LTA has already moved in damn fast and implemented Feeder service sbs 386 for their convenience. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Regarding the rumor that it would be incorporated into Westgate Shopping Mall - which is obvious by now that it is false - I think it was a misreading of the part which says that <a href="http://capitamall.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20120112_123200_C38U_1EC0CE565E449D4C482579830014A1AC.1.pdf">"Westgate has direct connectivity to both the Jurong East MRT and bus
              interchanges"</a>. </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, that part may indicate that the future new Jurong East air-conditioned bus interchange might be sited next to Westgate Shopping Mall and Jurong East MRT Station.</p>

              <p>Do not need a big interchange only for Bidadari... but services

                  Serangoon has fewer units as well.. maybe that is why the

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, basically changi south and tampines north are new areas. So there will be new bus services and minor amendment of some current services. Not major revamp in the east as what you opinionated. For your info, only 2 new interchanges in the east. Bedok is considered just a replacement for the existing temp not. Bedok is not new. </p>
              <p>Buangkok is in north-east. This is not in the east. For this, new services and some minor amendments at most. Cheers.  </p>

              <p>Well, I am sorry for not being clear. What I meant by "three new bus interchanges" is actually the upcoming Changi South Bus Terminal, the future Tampines North Bus Interchange and the future Buangkok Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Alright, maybe I have overreacted on the part where I say the bus routes may be revamped.</p>
              <p>I am sorry for writing it wrongly/not clear.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">What I am actually saying is that it may be that the LTA might have projected that the traffic around Bedok Bus Interchange cannot accomodate much more traffic, hence it might have capped the number of bus services at Bedok Bus Interchange and have only a number of parking lots that is just nice to fit the current number of services. </span></p>
              <p>It could be because of this - that Bedok Bus Interchange should not accomodate more bus services than what it is already accomodating - that's why LTA announced a bus terminal at Changi South. The bus terminal at Changi South may be there also because Tampines Bus Interchange may also be full and may also not be able to accomodate anymore bus services.</p>
              <p>I think moving on, until Tampines North Bus Interchange opens, any new bus service at Bedok and Tampines area will start from Changi South Bus Terminal, or any new roadside bus terminal (similar to the one at Taman Jurong) built in future.</p>
              <p>When Changi South Bus Terminal is full of new bus services and cannot accomodate any more new bus service already, I think by then Tampines North Bus Interchange would be built and ready to accomodate new bus services. Likewise, when Tampines North Bus Interchange is full, there will be another bus interchange, and so on. This is what I think may happen.</p>

              <p>Hi mr wsy1234, shopping centre already started building. It is
              on the way to completion by next yr end. Aircon bus interchange
              with shopping centre is not on the cards yet. The hawker centre
              together with the town centre is already conceptualised and
              location is at big field near the fo guang Shan. But not yet
              started soil ceremony. Along those LRT stations in Punggol east
              line, there is no available site anymore. Most are given to flats.
              For damai LRT, it is within walking distance to the mrt hawker
              centre in planning near fo guang Shan. For oasis LRT, they are
              already building a new shopping mall soon. For most flats in
              Punggol, they will have LRT either at doorstep or within walking
              distance. For those not reachable by LRT, LTA has already moved in
              damn fast and implemented Feeder service sbs 386 for their
              convenience. Cheers.</p>

                  there is no HDB construction announced yet...</p>
              <p>Tampines North I think will open only 2020+</p>
              <p>Tengah seems to be 2022+</p>
              <p>Bidadari should be 2019</p>
              <p>Punggol Matilda is 2017 (so this is the newest town within
                  Punggol)</p>
              <p>Punggol North should be 2024+ (after Waterway/Matilda is
                  developed)</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, already announced yesterday. HDB flats in tampines north can start applying in nov 2014 and for bidadari, it will be in mid 2015. </p>
              <p>Punggol Matilda is not the newest town in Punggol. It is Punggol northshore announced yesterday. </p>
              <p>Punggol north is not after waterway/Matilda. With Punggol northshore being built next yr, it is ongoing. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I am afraid Punggol Matilda will only have a

              are announced only for tampines north and bidadari in HDB plans.

              <p>JE int wont be built so soon yet. Jurong East will undergo a little change to the road structure first (A new road - side road beside Westgate will be connected to jurong gateway rd at the old interchange's entrance).</p>
              <p>Then the planning and construction for the new interchange will begin. The location is where the original interchange was (i.e. under the mrt tracks).</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the HDB documents indicate the bus interchanges will be built for tampines north and bidadari. Not for Punggol Matilda or the new Punggol northshore. Wonder if this is an indication that the Punggol west LRT will be the main form of transport for residents in Punggol west. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, the old Matilda house will be refurnished and will become the clubhouse for the condominium. Nothing to do with HDB flats. The new clubhouse will house a gym, a function room as well. It is part of 'A treasure trove' condominium by sim lian. Will be ready in yr 2015. Cheers.</p>
