              <p>Bedok mrt bus stop behind it is a small gradual hill where it still uses staircases to get to the old bus int. Till now if you notice, there is still a climbing staircase and a ramp beside the bedok mall at the side.</p>
              <p>Bedok hawker ctr has a higher ground than bedok mrt bus stop. Thus the naming. Bedok mall spans between both areas. Cheers</p>

              <p>Agreed... where am I saying no... Its just that the packed loading is between Eunos MRT and AMK MRT for sv 25 and Eunos MRT to Yishun for sv 854. The buses are not packed between Bedok and Eunos. I am saying 854 should start from Eunos as that's where the main load comes from. Also, you have 55 covering long stretch of the route in parallel. </p>
              <p>Anyway, it was just a suggestion for 854 since it was not mentioned in Bedok ITH announcement. It is okay for 854 to continue ply Bedok / Yishun. Doesn't hurt.</p>

              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the temp Int's total number of parking lots was a drop in number from the original old Bedok Int? So if the new Int's parking lots are the same in number as the Temp Int's, that means they figured out that the number of lots is enough after cutting?</p>
              <p>Oh yeah, the 56 lots for the Temp Int, it includes the 3x Sv 9 lots &amp; the 2 oddball lots at the other end of the Temp Int near Sv 854's berth right?</p>

              <p><br> Yes, apparently, it seems that all the boarding berths in the new Bedok Bus Interchange are sawtooth type.</p>
              <p>There seems to be around five beths for alighting (same as the new one at Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and around ten berths for boarding, with around fifty six average-sized parking lots and around two longer-than-average parking lots.</p>
              <p>But then, even if there will be around the same number of alighting berths, the one at Bedok should be more fast-flowing (able to handle more buses in the same time) than the one at Boon Lay, since Bedok has only one bus service that will potentially use articulated buses (for all we know, Double Decker buses may be deployed on that SMRT bus service eventually), whereas Boon Lay has four.</p>

                  <p>This driveway does not lead to the bus interchange. Instead, it leads to the residential developments at level 3.</p>
                  <p>There are two driveways: one leding to the bus interchange, one leading to Bedok North Drive.</p>
                  <p>The former is located right beside the above-mentioned driveway, while the latter is located right nearest to the temporary bus interchange, where you can already see some sawtooth berths.</p>

              <p><br> It seems that the new Bedok Bus Interchange is "multi-storey"; single level but the "slanted at a gradient" such that it spreads from the ground level to the second level. 
              There is this walkway from Bedok Mall level two to level one that is already open and people use it to walk from New Upper Changi Road to Bedok North Drive.</p>
              <p>It seems that there will be a pedestrian access at that walkway for people to enter/exit the new bus interchange, which is somewhat similar to last time when people walk from Bedok MRT Station underpass to the original bus interchange, via a walkway beside a hawker centre.</p>

              <p>When they do planning for new towns, they should allocate enough space for bus interchanges. To save space they can make it within mall - that is okay. But have sufficient lots for multiple services.</p>

              <p><br> It seems that the new Bedok Bus Interchange is "multi-storey";
              single level but the "slanted at a gradient" such that it spreads
              from the ground level to the second level. There is this walkway
              from Bedok Mall level two to level one that is already open and
              people use it to walk from New Upper Changi Road to Bedok North
              Drive.</p>
              <p>It seems that there will be a pedestrian access at that walkway
              for people to enter/exit the new bus interchange, which is somewhat
              similar to last time when people walk from Bedok MRT Station
              underpass to the original bus interchange, via a walkway beside a
              hawker centre.</p>

              <p>There is a boarded up elevated platform next to the bedok mall main entrance..near nubox there. Part of the boarding cover on top has been removed so there will be escalator and staircase direct to level 2 of the mall which will be the interchg. Seems rather soon it is going to open...drilling noises all that can be heard in the mall.</p>
              <p>Qsn is will all the parking lots be able to fit the buses coming into the interchg? Mostly likely not. Now that bsep buses are added, more somewhat extra buses can be seen laying over at the side of interchgs like tampines..former sv8 sawtooth berth onwards can see buses laying over.</p>
