                              <p>Layout wise, isn't the layout of the new bus interchange the
              same as the temporary bus interchange? If the layout is the same
              and operations was okay in the temporary bus interchange, then
              layout is not the issue.</p>
              <p>From the comments here, it seems that the issue is with the
              traffic flow.</p>
              <p>Possible adjustment:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>I notice there are eight bus services coming in from blk204
              side, while there are twenty two bus services coming in from
              blk35/37/40 side. (reference: <a href="https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sbst_bedok1.png" rel="nofollow">https://publictransportsg.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/sbst_bedok1.png</a>

              There are more buses coming in from blk35/37/40 side than from
              blk204 side. LTA can consider re-routing some routes (eg. 225G) at
              the more congested side to enter from the other side (from blk204)
              which has less bus services using; <strong>balance the number of
              bus services coming in from each side</strong>.</li>
              </ol>

              the temp int got a generous 3-lane wide driveway from the entrance till the Int office. therefore buses can continue enter the Int while the traffic lights were green. Also the alighting berths were longer and could there allow more buses to alight pax at one go.

              1 immediate solution is to re-open part of the old temp int and channel some bus services there.

              <p>it will be soon, if no other "good idea", If i am the transport minister i will order the old interchange to open back and move some or all service back to the old interchange. This is a very stupid and rush design as i suspect it is a very political things. As the last election east coast GRC came very close to lost to WP. it might back fired to PAP if nothing done for the bus traffic to go smoothly. </p>

              <p>What's different for Bedok in this case is that both temp int and the ITH use the same road to enter and exit. If the temp int continues to be in use, there will be a extra set of traffic lights and this might cause a bigger jam.</p>

              <p>I think it better move back to the old interchange some of the
              trunk service and only feeder buses service go into the
              interchange. or drop people off the old interchange and pick up
              people in the new one and park the buses at the old interchange. i
              think before long lta will need a extension of the interchage like
              seng kang and tampines so no need to rebuild one use back the old

              yes; due to design failure by the architects who failed to provide cross ventilation.
              other similar examples incl Sengkang. 
              Sgoon &amp; BNL still got a little cross ventilation coz a small section of side walls are made of grilles hence air can flow across between here and entrance driveway.
