              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the HDB documents indicate the bus
              interchanges will be built for tampines north and bidadari. Not for
              Punggol Matilda or the new Punggol northshore. Wonder if this is an
              indication that the Punggol west LRT will be the main form of
              transport for residents in Punggol west. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Apart from feeders, there needs to be at least one trunk service each that starts at interchange and leaves Punggol after doing Matilda / Northshore / Waterway. It will be really bad for residents, if they have to take feeder everytime to Punggol Interchange.</p>

              <p>Also if you note north of Waterway, east of Punggol road has huge markings for future HDB complexes and schools. This entire area will not have LRT even close to it. There will need to be 2-3 services here just like you have sv 3, 83, 85 plying Punggol Central to take care of the loading.</p>
              <p>I am sure the prices of apartments in Punggol central have dropped given so much construction around and more supply than demand. Are you in loss dupdup?</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, that portion will have the future punggol semi expressway to link yishun to punggol to pasir ris. Of course there will be bus services going past here which I mention to another guy in this forum too. For these trunk services, they may not be using punggol as a interchange because there is no need to go inside punggol interchange. The trunk buses may just stop outside punggol central outside punggol interchange and move on to punggol road and then the punggol semi expressway. This will not take up space at the punggol interchange which I think is good. </p>
              <p>The price of my house will further increase. Why? Opposite my house will be the site earmarked for mixed commercial residential coming up in URA plan. So we suspect is something like bedok mall with condo above. Hope capital land will win the bidding in years to come. </p>
              <p>Moreover, my house is just opposite a big field which is reserved. Most of the punggol central residents suspect this to be the mrt station linking punggol mrt and the future pasir ris mrt by the cross-region line in yr 2030. When the cross-region line is announced in the next few years with locations made known, my house value will increase. We are even suspecting that it can house a bus interchange too. This will be enough to move all buses to both eastern and western punggol. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, the LRT station nearest punggol 17th avenue should be the samudera station which is part of the western LRT loop. In the bto plans announced a few days ago, this station will offer linkage to all the HDB flats for punggol northshore btos. The planning looks good and the HDB flats look beautiful with sea view. But sorry, without a car, you may have difficulty getting out of punggol considering the public transport is not good. You can have the seaview but not the convenience. No wonder there is a saying say you cannot have the cake and eat it too. Cheers.</p>

              <p>There will be another interchange most likely. All the recent
              news do not state anywhere. Maybe it will be announced together
              with btos in yr 2015. </p>
              <p>There are many more empty lands for that. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes you are right. There is a huge piece of land opposite my house which is specially reserved under URA plan. Punggol central residents are predicting it to be a mrt station for the cross-region line in yr 2030. Hope I am still there when 2025 to 2030 comes. If in the next few years when locations for cross-region mrt stations are finalized and it happened not to be so, then this will also be an ideal location for a bus interchange. </p>
              <p>The other mixed commercial parcel of land opposite my house may have a small chance of housing a bus terminal.  So we shall see later on. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I agree. Currently some roads are being constructed to lead into these areas. As for bus services and terminals/interchange, they should have already been in planning when they develop new btos. It is just that they are not made known. The only way to know is see the land being demarcated for exact type of use in URA plan. And when hoardings are being erected, go down to exact site to ask. Cheers. </p>
