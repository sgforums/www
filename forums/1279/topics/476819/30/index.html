              <p><br> I am not questioning whether 67 deserves DDs. It definitely does,
              but the route cannot accommodate DDs because of low trees between
              Newton and Little India. Same reason why 48, 66 do not have
              DDs.</p>
              <p>67 is actually a very long route. LTA should really consider
              splitting it into two. No one takes it for such long
              distance.</p>

              <p>I am confused. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>What exactly is the Double Decker bus model that SMRT is
              procuring? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Is it just the 103 units of <a title="Alexander Dennis Enviro500" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alexander-dennis.com/products/enviro500/">Alexander Dennis Enviro500</a> (mentioned in <a title="a Facebook post" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/ATENVIRO/posts/10152264396326469?stream_ref=5">a Facebook post</a>) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">or does it also include around 100 units of
              MAN Lion's City DD? </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Because according to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> - a rather credible source that has "predicted" many new bus routes
              - it seems that SMRT is procuring Double Decker buses from two
              brands (MAN and Alexander Dennis), instead of just that one brand
              (Alexander Dennis) which we have (more) sources to confirm
              it. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>If it is true that SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker
              bus, then this may explain why the dates vary in some
              sources; <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Previously, someone
              shared with me a picture of a SMRT tender document showing that the
              Double Decker buses will be introduced in August 2014. This week,
              SMRT say that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in June
              2014. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At first, I thought that SMRT
              is accelerating the procurement process, thus they can introduce
              the Double Decker buses in June 2014. Now that I have read this
              article from <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> , I think I know why there are two different dates: SMRT is
              procuring two models of Double Decker bus. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Therefore, instead of around 100 units, <strong>SMRT is actually
              introducing around 203 units of Double Decker bus - by the end of
              this year</strong>. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Currently, according to <a title="Wikipedia" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">Wikipedia</a>, including the one with 'SMB' prefix, SMRT
              has 324 units of Articulated bus. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>On the assumption that part of the around 203 units of Double
              Decker bus will replace some units of Articulated bus, say 75% of
              them (since BSEP is primarily about enhancing existing bus
              services, then secondarily about adding new bus services), around
              152 units of Articulated bus will be replaced with around 152 units
              of Double Decker bus by the end of this year. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>But then again, I thought SMRT said that "while the
              double-deckers will be useful for adding capacity on services into
              the city, they are not as suitable for heavily-used feeder routes"
              (<a title="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers" rel="nofollow" href="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers">http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers</a>)
              - which implies that it may continue to have Articulated buses in
              its fleet? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>So, I guess SMRT wants to just reduce the composition of
              Articulated buses in its fleet, and not totally replace them with
              Double Decker buses. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Could this be SMRT's only procurement of Double Decker buses at
              this juncture, and there will be procurement of new Articulated
              buses next year to replace the units of Articulated bus that would
              remain next year? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Please correct me if I am
              wrong. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p><br> Again, let me re-iterate. There are other services like 857/985
                  that deserve high capacity buses more than 61 today. The loading on
                  sv 61 has dropped quite a lot (part of it could be people have
                  opted for other services). Problem with 61 is also its long winding
                  route all the way to Eunos.</p>
              <p>The route of 61 should be shortened to improve on-time arrivals.
                  I suggest even if it does Bukit Batok to Harbourfront Interchange,
                  it caters to most of the load. From there on you have other

              <p>Sorry la... no one takes 61 from Bukit Batok to Eunos... We need shorter routes (also see new routes launched by LTA). Long winding routes like 51, 61, 67 etc. often cause schedule slippage, bus bunching and such long travel times. Gone are those days when people would take 51 from Jurong to Hougang or 67 from CCK to Tampines.</p>

              <p><br> I am not questioning whether 67 deserves DDs. It definitely does,
                  but the route cannot accommodate DDs because of low trees between

              <p>The URA Master Plan 2013/4 say that there will be new bus interchanges at Tampines North, Woodlands North, another part of Hougang, .... not sure if I remembered correctly. but they did say that there will be new bus interchanges in future.</p>
              <p>I believe the bulk of the additional new bus services are for the new HDB towns (eg. Tampines North, Punggol Maltida and Bidadari), and/or for the SMRT areas (eg. Yishun &amp; Choa Chu Kang) - which have weaker bus service. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The government is constructing a new (temporary) bus interchange facility at Yishun. I guess they have already made provisions for new bus services over there. </span></p>
              <p>Likewise for the other new bus interchanges in future. </p>
              <p>Whereas for Choa Chu Kang, I guess there will be roadside bus terminals, if the Choa Chu Kang bus interchange has no space to accommodate new bus services.</p>

              <p>Actually, in my opinion, it would be better if the bus routes are re-designed, rather than just the existing routes enhanced and new routes introduced.</p>
              <p>If it is about a single bus route not able to meet a large demand, then ask private operators to run the busy stretches - along with the public operators. No need to introduce new bus routes just to relieve the load. Thereafter, if the demand is really too high that even private operators cannot relieve, then the government come and give public operators more buses to enhance the public bus service.</p>
              <p>Re-designing (re-drawing) the bus routes would mean re-routing bus routes to cater better to the needs and wants of the people in today's world, because there may be some places that no longer have a demand as significant as in the past, such as schools (due to aging population in the area and there is a smaller proportion of school-going people). </p>
              <p>After the bus routes are re-routed, new bus routes can then be created - to compensate the loss of links resulted.  </p>
              <p>That is for the existing towns. At least this will save resources for service improvements in other expects (eg: new long-distance bus routes that offer direct bus connection).</p>
              <p>Whereas for the new towns, it is clear that new bus routes have to be introduced (because there are very little or none), but that is to serve new areas. </p>
              <p>Likewise, when the bus routes experience high demand, private operators can be called in to relieve the load from public operators. and if the demand if way too high, the government can come in and give public operators more buses to operate the routes.</p>

              Again, let me re-iterate. There are other services like 857/985
              that deserve high capacity buses more than 61 today. The loading on
              sv 61 has dropped quite a lot (part of it could be people have
              opted for other services). Problem with 61 is also its long winding
              route all the way to Eunos.</p>
              <p>The route of 61 should be shortened to improve on-time arrivals.
              I suggest even if it does Bukit Batok to Harbourfront Interchange,
              it caters to most of the load. From there on you have other
              services.</p>

              The problem with Route 61 was already there from SBS era. Back then, SBS deployed mainly DDs (brand-new VO3Xs)on 61.

              shorter routes (also see new routes launched by LTA). Long winding

              <p><br>Are you sure? I didn't hear of any such press release. If It is confirmed, it is great. Buangkok MRT is poorly used today because of poor bus connectivity. People along HG Ave 6 take 27 to HG MRT. Even from Buangkok link, Buangkok Green, HG St 51 etc that are closer to Buangkok MRT, people take bus to HG making it over crowded.</p>
              <p>Once Buangkok Interchange comes, can have new services from there towards Seletar and Upper Serangoon Road.</p>

              <p><br>1. Do you have enough parking spots for sv 27 there? Remember it is a service with 04-05 mins frequency?</p>
              <p>2. What about the missing link between Sengkang, Buangkok and Hougang. Do you realise sv 27 is one of the two services at Buangkok MRT, and only service on upper leg of HG Ave 6 to connect to HG MRT?</p>
