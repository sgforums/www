              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Sorry for the erroneous statement on capacity in Double-decker
              versus Bendy bus. The statement was made based on the 2 news
              articles – which are referring to the London Routemaster. Based on
              the designs, the seating capacity of Singapore’s Double-decker (in
              this case, it’s a MAN A39) is definitely bigger than London’s
              (Routemaster).</p>
              <p>Since there is a frequent issue of commuters not moving to the
              2nd compartment, it would mean that the standing capacity of Bendy
              buses is actually more or less similar to that of Double-deckers,
              likewise for the wheelchair space and boarding/waiting time. It is
              faster to alight from Bendy buses only because they have an
              additional door – at the 2nd compartment.</p>
              <p>Overall, a Double-decker has a higher capacity than a Bendy bus.
              Also, as there is more seating capacity, the proportion of
              commuters on DD getting a seat is larger, which means the comfort
              level of DD is higher than that of Bendy bus (although I do not
              know how is the standard of comfort measured). Other than the
              alighting time part, Double-deckers are better for commuters than
              Bendy buses.</p>
              <p>On the Technical aspect, since it requires less fuel than a
              Bendy bus and it is cheaper to maintain, Double-deckers are also
              better for the operators (in this case, it’s SMRT) than Bendy
              buses.</p>
              <p>When the MAN A39 makes its debut in Singapore on SMRT bus
              routes, I hope to (joy)ride on one of the buses, if I have the
              time. From the videos I viewed on Youtube showing rides on the MAN
              A39, it seems that the ride is smooth and the interior design of
              the upper deck looks sleek.</p>

              <p>A quick primer on the advantages and disadvantages of double-decker buses:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/doubledecker-buses-to-run-again-in-sydney-20120823-24nyy.html">http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/doubledecker-buses-to-run-again-in-sydney-20120823-24nyy.html</a></p>
              <p>Sydney is not getting rid of their bendy buses anytime soon; they are still the preferred buses on frequently stopping and high turnover Metrobus routes.</p>

              <p>No. The city centre of Sydney is just as crowded. The tailback during morning peak period in Sydney to the bus terminal is 750 metres, bus bumper to bumper. The solution is to keep the bendy buses out of the city centre. Confine them to short-haul shuttles that loop through minor roads.</p>
              <p>Good luck trying to educate passengers. Several campaigns later we all know what the outcome is. The other solution is to have conductors or more inspectors, but since OMO who is willing to pay for them?</p>

              <p><br>I am sorry but I defer to accept your argument. I travel often to Sydney, Perth with work, and the situation there is completely different. To start with,  there is NO robust bus network. I tried taking bus to work one day and while I was studying the route map, I observed that for most routes, you need to change at the main terminal.</p>
              <p>Also, Sydney has scope to expand. It is not an island. The city is not over-crowded. People live in places like Botany and travel to work. Car is one of the popular means to travel.

              <p>Try standing along York Street in Sydney and St. Georges Terrace in Perth during peak hour and watch how many traffic cycles buses have to go through.</p>
              <p>In my opinon, neither does Singapore have a robust bus network (otherwise we would not be discussing about Singapore's transportation woes now). Neither is Sydney nor Perth. Actually we are not disagreeing on this point. What I am trying to say is that any city that fails to understand the different purposes of double-decker buses and bendy buses will not get the most out of what they want for their public transport system.</p>
              <p>And yes, most Singaporeans do not have a real choice between public transport and the car. The last thing any transport planner should do is to stick to one or two stubborn "one-size-fits-all" models without considering all possible alternatives and let the poor passengers deal with the consequences (which is what is happening now). This is disappointing given how Singapore aims for efficiency in many other aspects.</p>

              <p><br>I think people have already started doing so. Observed on very short routes like 225G / 225W also, lot of people go upstairs when they board the bus. I think some take it as a form of exercise/activity to climb some more steps even if it is 3-4 stops.</p>

SMRT did the correct thing to bring in a dd under trial. Now SMRT really has to carefully plan out which routes to use dds and which to use bendies. Perhaps they can even do a survey to gain feedback so they can deploy the buses more effectively. One thing for sure is that bendies have to be reduced due to the road conditions over here.</p></div>
