              <p>24 buses (18 DDs, 6 SDs)</p>

              <p>16 buses (8 DDs, 8 SDs)</p>

              <p>3 buses (0 DDs, 3 SDs)</p>
              <p>* Capacity enhanced with 1 bus - would also recommend the bus to loop at Irau Drive once it is operational and call at 3 new stops along this stretch.</p>

              <p>Having said that, I also told my friend it is good to have
              bendies also on trunk services like 67 and 176 that really need
              high capacity buses and cannot have them due to height restriction.
              Bendies are very useful here. He said 176 okay, 67 LTA is not very
              happy with bendies coz it plies Little India area causing
              congestion there.</p>
              <p>I think if 67 does not have bendies, as of today, it will be
              total chaos. So good LTA is not being a dictator here. Maybe
              after DTL opens, 67 might not need that many bendies and can be
              split into two services</p>
              <p>67 - CCK to Lor 1 Geylang</p>
              <p>68 - Tampines to Rochor Canal Road (Loop)</p>

              <p>Yes, it's obvious the blacklist of bendies stretches out of the city. Eg. Bukit Timah Rd is another reason why 67 bendies can be quite a trouble. </p>

              <p>Yah la..that's why I've also put "as long as they can maintain properly". And it's "somewhat profitable".</p>
              <p>Just wondering lah...given the level of passengers to ferry each day, wouldn't the bus maintenace be cui?</p>
              <p>Let alone SMRT, even some SBST buses already having problem-loud engine from CDGE/KUB, increase in extreme vibrations from earlier batch of KUBs(worst than OCs). Does the depot have enough manpower/time/facilities? If no, why isn't there an improvement there? :/ </p>

              <p>852 : not to the extend of full rigids, get some DDs or at least bendies.</p>
              <p>854 : 18 DDs?</p>
              <p>855 does not warrant any DDs yet.</p>
              <p>858 has an option to get some bendies, a advantage over other CGA Bound buses, especially 27.</p>
              <p>859 route may be gone, missing routes to be covered by a SBW feeder. </p>

              <p>if you said no high cap buses for 800, people will tend to take
              812 to get to some places.</p>

              <p>Actually people who want to go to MRT take 812 and not 800. I have seen 800 with 20-25 pax on West part of ring road to yishun ave 2. The bus gets 20-25 pax each at stops opp blk 228 and blk 257. This is where the loading reaches 70 pax. But then by increasing capacity on 804, people can rather take 804 from these two stops to  Yishun MRT. Hence, I am suggesting full fleet high capacity buses for 804.</p>
              <p>Coming to 812, people living on ring road north of ave 5 normally choose  Yishun, those to the south of ave 5 opt for Khatib. That's where the load gets split well. Having said that each bus does get 80+ pax and hence completely justifies only high capacity buses.</p>
              <p>also don't forget that for 800 with removal of bendy, one bus is also added to improve intra-town frequency.</p>

              <p>855 definitely warrants 2 DDs. 852 is the one that does not need. Also if you see, 852 has 74 in common until King Albert Park, and 157 joins in at Macritchie and goes same route all the way till Bukit Batok.</p>

              <p>858 cannot get Bendies due or sharp turns within airport terminal. 859 route should stay but with only SDs. For 851, I suggested 10 DDs that will leave consecutively one after another to cover peak loading towards Bukit Merah. Opposite direction loading can be managed by SD. I have done the route loading segmentation and thus suggesting 10:16 - this is already a big increase in high capacity buses for 851 which lost many Bendies when 851 became WAB.</p>

              <p>For your comment on 882, I will just say first let them add at least one more bus. Only 2 buses in operation with horrible frequency.</p>

              <p>Technically 858 could. </p>
              <p>But in logic's perspective no. </p>
              <p>Why? Coz it 1. Waste time, 2. Takes up space and thus blocks buses and 3. Pressurizes the BC. </p>
              <p>However 858 rigids doesn't come at an impressive freq too to make up loss of lack of high capacity buses, thus making it lose out to 27. </p>
              <p>And that's also why you see long queues at 858 berth at CGA everyday without fail. </p>
