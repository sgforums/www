              my opinion why SMRT Buses lose money maybe due to lack of economy of scale in operation. bus fares are kept affordably low + concessions as compared to other developed countries like HK. even jb public bus fares seem high as compared to their average citizen pay. one possible way is to let one one operator take charge of entire island bus svcs. anyway LTA as regulatory body to ensure good svc standard and affordable fares is good to prevent abuse of monopoly.

              <p>But if your capacity increases, wouldn't that means that more people are willing to take public transport? </p>
              <p>Don't just look at the area leh. If you fleet upgrade your SD to DD, not only each bus will be rather more on time, they are able to pick up all passengers. Now with the BSRF, wouldn't the operators enjoy on-time schedule then? Long term effect may also lead to slight increase in ridership.</p>
              <p>Not always is there a need to deploy DD on AP, but it still depends. It's still got to do with your method of deployment. If your company is here to serve people, then pls do some short survey lah. Why would somebody deploy a SD on 161 as last bus/weekends? When you know the svc is rather demanding? Why would somebody deploy a SD during peak timing(school hours etc)? </p>

              <p>TBH, I rather they have fare hike, BUT with acceptable maintenance. </p>
              <p>At least during hot days, your bus must have med. speed aircon. At least during PH/Weekends, even if there's lack of drivers, you must deploy HIGH capacity buses.</p>
              <p>But sadly speaking, right now at least half of the rides were under acceptable level~  </p>

              cover peak loading towards Bukit Merah. Opposite direction loading
              can be managed by SD. I have done the route loading segmentation
              and thus suggesting 10:16 - this is already a big increase in high

              <p>Yes from Bedok to HG ave 2... But there is a whole uniqueness in the route of 854 that it is the only service connecting Eunos, HG Ave 3-2 to YCK road and a Yishun, resulting into heavy loading during peak hours. Rigids just cannot manage the loading on 854. In fact 55 and 25 also have a big part of route on common yet 55 got 10 DDs from an earlier fleet of 5 DDs.</p>
