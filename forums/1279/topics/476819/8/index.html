              <p>"That's cute! We are committed to renew our bus fleet, and have <strong>recently purchased over 200 MAN buses</strong>. We do hope that you have an enjoyable journey on our buses with these recent additions!" - SMRT (<a title="https://www.facebook.com/SMRTCorpSG/posts/651304464910031" href="https://www.facebook.com/SMRTCorpSG/posts/651304464910031">https://www.facebook.com/SMRTCorpSG/posts/651304464910031</a>)</p>
              <p>I saw this comment at SMRT’s facebook page. I think this is the closest to confirming that the MAN A39 Double Decker buses belong to them. I think SMRT only wants to officially announce the addition of MAN A39 DD buses in 2014, probably as part of their 2014 Financial Year starting on 1 April 2014. Nonetheless, this Facebook comment is the closest to confirming that the MAN A39 Double Decker buses belong to SMRT.</p>
              <p>According to <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses</a>, SMRT currently has 323 articulated buses. SMRT confirmed that they have purchased over 200 MAN A39 Double Decker buses.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is just the first batch of SMRT Double Decker buses and there will be more batches of SMRT Double Decker buses in future. I foresee that eventually, all the SMRT articulated buses will be replaced by Double Decker buses and since Singapore is anticipating larger population by 2030, some Single Deck buses may also be replaced by Double Decker buses.</p>

              <p>and that guy even say that Sv172 cant use DD because of Tengah

              the bus routes to Paya lebar airbase cant use DDs... so what are
              the DDs on Sv90/94 doing down there??  what is DD got to do
              with the airbase? sit inside the DDs can see what is happening in

              <p>Why not let 190 extend to Lim Chu Kang as you want DDs to run there?</p>
              
              <p>90 and 94 had already withdrawn their DDs in 2003 due to weak demand and not Paya Lebar Airbase, they can all do with their Mercz and K230UB. DDs can only be introduced 9 years later once everything develops and the demand is settled.</p>

              <p>Why talk so much when it only says MAN buses. How you know all DDs? What about the A24 bendies, maybe 388S turned out successful? You never know if some of the 200 plus buses are bendies for the short haul and feeders Intratowns. Or better still, what if some of the 200 over buses are just a further add of A22 rigids? </p>
              <p>Where's the proof? Calm down lah</p>

              <p>I saw this comment at SMRT’s facebook page. I think this is the
              closest to confirming that the MAN A39 Double Decker buses belong
              to them. I think SMRT only wants to officially announce the
              addition of MAN A39 DD buses in 2014, probably as part of their
              2014 Financial Year starting on 1 April 2014. Nonetheless, this
              Facebook comment is the closest to confirming that the MAN A39
              Double Decker buses belong to SMRT.</p>
              <p>According to <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses</a>,
              SMRT currently has 323 articulated buses. SMRT confirmed that they
              have purchased over 200 MAN A39 Double Decker buses.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is just the first batch of SMRT Double Decker buses
              and there will be more batches of SMRT Double Decker buses in

              <p>And as you've said, some rigids may be replaced by high capacity buses. How you know only DDs can do the job? Replace 913 rigids with bendies cannot? What if the order is way over 323, and is set to also target the feeders and Intratowns by phasing out the rigids, since population increasing? </p>
              <p>Not to be against of DDs, but how you know SMRT TOTALLY gave up? Yes, 323 bendies, but it may not be all DDs replacing 323 bendies, right? </p>
              <p>Sorry, but I find this speculation too far from us to say, somehow. </p>

              <p>Ok. I will not say 172 needs DDs but it definitely needs more higher capacity buses. A lot of people from CCK and Boon Lay take 172 for point to point connection and travel lond distance on it. With the road conditions not being great, it is a further hassle for people to stand these long distance. </p>
              <p>The bus easily takes 90-95 pax. I have also noticed when I take 199 a lot of people alight at the stop before PIE to transfer to 172. I have also seen many times rigid a are already full from Boon Lay, Jalan Bahar stops, and do not stop at Aft PIE stop because it is full and no one alights. Bendies clear the full load here.</p>
              <p>now even within CCK, people use 172 to get to MRT and many times is shorter and faster than taking 300.</p>
