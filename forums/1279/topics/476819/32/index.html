              <p>Thus, the most straightfoward way to address overcrowding and congestion for 27, 34, 147, and the Tampines Avenue 7 / Loyang Corridor may be to introduce a bus operated by SMRT, commencing from Yishun or Yio Chu Kang, duplicating these crowded services to a certain extent, to serve the area.</p>
              <p>Similarly, overcrowding for Bukit Panjang buses may be efficiently addressed, through introducing buses by SBSTransit, commencing from Jurong East terminal to serve the area, duplicating 190 instead of pumping tax-payer's money to SMRT through BSEP.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, 67 will remain between Tampines and Little India for sure, and then will mostly be run by SBST. The place where its loading will get affected is around Bukit Timah, but I still believe it will have significant load from CCK to Bukit Timah, just that SMRT might not need to ply the service (may get renumbered) all the way and can cut short it earlier.</p>

              <p>I dont agree with any of the points you have made above. They seem very myopic.</p>
              <p>The reason 190, 960 have poor service have nothing to do with monopoly here. It is just that SMRT ran out of high capacity buses and took a very long time to bring DDs in. Was LTA sleeping and letting them take their own time?</p>
              <p>Cargo services 9, 19, 89 have received improvements consistently, and have a good frequency and managing loads very well. So I totally disagree here. Yes, there are still improvements required in certain services, but if 67 has to ply from Tampines to Little India, does not make sense to give it to SMRT. There is no depot close by, will have to run buses from AMDEP and let SMRT concentrate on CCK/BPJ/YIS/BBT/WDL before it wants to expand.</p>

              <p>Your evidence does not stand. </p>
              <p>The jams is not created by inefficient bus services. In fact, the delays and hence the overcrowding is caused by the jam itself. The jam is a result of a single traffic junction controlling the busiest avenues of two of the east's busiest towns, and one of the island's most used expressway. If you notice carefully 89e at PM peak comes at pinpoint accuracy with space to sit, all the way until it reaches the junction. That's why if you observe from Sengkang onwards the buses are always late. </p>

              <p><br>That should be the reason. For 58, bi-directional high loading is at UBI because it is the only service here. Then towards Pasir Ris very high loading. Opp direction, many pax alight at Tai Seng and Serangoon. So current mix of DD/SD seems okay to me.</p>

              <p>WLDEP bendies are split, 530U,755M,736T are full day, i think only 975U and 1019Z are full day. 981B,1020T,1022M,1111P  are split. </p>
              <p>AMDEP side i think 620T n 622M are full day, the OC suspect full day. I think only 1 or 2 bendies from AM are full day. 984T is split.</p>

              <p><br>There are ofcourse bendies on 854, but the number of rigids is just not justified for the high loading the service has. Actually 854 should be more meant to cater between Yishun and Eunos. IF SMRT does not have enough buses, it should just ply 854 from Yishun to Eunos with high capacity buses. There is anyway 25 with almost full fleet DD service going in parallel all the way from AMK Ave 3/ YCK rd junction.</p>

              hmm. that makes better sense if the 2nd order comes true. or else with only 103 DDs; sv 190 alone easily 'eats up' 1/3 of it already. maybe can temp cramp more buses parking overnight at the bus int &amp; terminals 1st?

              <p>I think when the DDs come in the trunks' bendies will go over to non-trunks and replace the rigids there so as to boost capacity for the time being. Maybe a few DDs will go over to selected feeders too, but I believe it won't be many, and it won't stay there for long (probably a trial). </p>
