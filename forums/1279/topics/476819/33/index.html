              <p>With new svc and fleet upgrading Smrt should expand their depots..</p>
              <p>A new Woodlands depot that can accommodate at least 550 buses for Woodlands regional,Woodlands north &amp; Bukit Panjang</p>
              <p>A new depot nearby Amdep that can hold 500 buses minimum for Yishun,Simpang &amp; probably Sembawang too.</p>
              <p>Bulim capacity is 600 I think and probably for Tengah,Bukit Batok &amp; Choa Chu Kang besides Boon Lay</p>
              <p>A sub bus park nearby Kallang that can hold at least 280 buses mainly for cbd &amp; eastern bound,Bukit Merah &amp; Harbourfront svc.Remember Marina South getting new interchange also.</p>

              <p>Bro, I don't think they did say they are<strong> fully</strong> interested in both types of buses(bendy n DD). </p>
              <p>Perhaps from now till 2017, they could be still considering whether there's a need for such bendy buses with 80 new routes under BSEP, more train lines upcoming etc. </p>
              <p>Which means that SMRT MAY not buy any bendy if running SDs and DDs are okay..and it may be true. But we can't be sure of it too~ Just don't be like someone can already..</p>

              <p>1. Stop putting words into my mouth. I was replying to the comment in the context of "If happen by this year...". I said SMRT Buses will not buy new bendy buses in the immediate future because there is sufficient in the existing fleet to go around and there will be insufficient space to accomodate a purchase of new bendy buses on such short notice. I did not say SMRT Buses will not buy any new bendies <em>ever</em>.</p>
              <p>2. Stop putting words into SMRT's mouth. There is equal chance of reading the statement and interpretate as SMRT using existing bendy buses to perform the dual operation. It could have gone either way. There is NO <em>explicit</em> statement of SMRT Buses expressing interest or intending to buy new bendy buses.</p>

              <p>4. If you have read my posting history, I actually support the use of bendy buses under the correct conditions (feeder routes being one of them). I do not understand why you have to jump at today's reply.</p>

              <p>You need to be aware of one thing that SMRT has to say both DDs and Bendies are important. They still have a huge fleet of Bendies, so they have to protect them. They can't be like "oh we were wrong with just relying on Bendies all these years". You have to understand that the statement is more political. Let's wait for a WAB bendy order. 388S has been around for more than a year. It it was so important for SMRT, an order would have been placed already. For now, let's rejoice that SMRT has taken the tight decision by introducing DDs. </p>

              And yes, you are right. It was a different era, where MRTs were
              few, traffic was lesser. Hence, people would still take long
              distance on 61 and DDs made sense. Today, if you deploy DD on 61 it
              is a priviledge.</p>

              <p><br>Regarding Simei having a bus terminal, very difficult because no space and lot of crowd. Hougang South may not have an interchange but can definitely have a bus terminal with 2 buses starting from here (and I dont count 115 because it really needs to be withdrawn).</p>
              <p>325 would be a good candidate to start from Hougang South. 113 as well looping @ St 11, and going to the inner part of HG Ave 1 that does not have a service today.</p>

              <p>Coz weekend load toggles between 40-60 pax for 161... Manageable by SDs, yet there are good number of DDs plying as well.</p>

              <p>Hi.  </p>
              <p>I would like to share with everyone how I<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> think the new livery would look like on the MAN Lion's City DD, and roughly how it would look like on the Double Decker bus models that SMRT has in its bus fleet. </span></p>
              <p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/t31.0-8/10012698_1392621881016155_1280872851_o.jpg" alt="" width="1154" height="432"></p>
              <p>This is done using Photoshop CS3 Extended, on the drawing at <a href="http://www.4shared.com/photo/mx0D9Dlk/man_lions_city_dd.html">http://www.4shared.com/photo/mx0D9Dlk/man_lions_city_dd.html</a>. It<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> is basically a "stretched" version of the new livery that is being applied to the Standard 12-metre buses that SMRT has. </span></p>
              <p>Please advise me on how it could be better, and I will edit the picture and share the edited picture here for further comments. Thanks! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
