              <p>I am confused. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>What exactly is the Double Decker bus model that SMRT is procuring? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Is it just the 103 units of <a title="Alexander Dennis Enviro500" href="http://www.alexander-dennis.com/products/enviro500/">Alexander Dennis Enviro500</a> (mentioned in <a title="a Facebook post" href="https://www.facebook.com/ATENVIRO/posts/10152264396326469?stream_ref=5">a Facebook post</a>) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">or does it also include around 100 units of MAN Lion's City DD? </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Because according to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> - a rather credible source that has "predicted" many new bus routes - it seems that SMRT is procuring Double Decker buses from two brands (MAN and Alexander Dennis), instead of just that one brand (Alexander Dennis) which we have (more) sources to confirm it. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>If it is true that SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker bus, then this may explain why the dates vary in some sources; <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Previously, someone shared with me a picture of a SMRT tender document showing that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in August 2014. This week, SMRT say that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in June 2014. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At first, I thought that SMRT is accelerating the procurement process, thus they can introduce the Double Decker buses in June 2014. Now that I have read this article from <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> , I think I know why there are two different dates: SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker bus. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Therefore, instead of around 100 units, <strong>SMRT is actually introducing around 203 units of Double Decker bus - by the end of this year</strong>. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Currently, according to <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">Wikipedia</a>, including the one with 'SMB' prefix, SMRT has 324 units of Articulated bus. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>On the assumption that part of the around 203 units of Double Decker bus will replace some units of Articulated bus, say 75% of them (since BSEP is primarily about enhancing existing bus services, then secondarily about adding new bus services), around 152 units of Articulated bus will be replaced with around 152 units of Double Decker bus by the end of this year. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>But then again, I thought SMRT said that "while the double-deckers will be useful for adding capacity on services into the city, they are not as suitable for heavily-used feeder routes" (<a title="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers" href="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers">http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers</a>) - which implies that it may continue to have Articulated buses in its fleet? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>So, I guess SMRT wants to just reduce the composition of Articulated buses in its fleet, and not totally replace them with Double Decker buses. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Could this be SMRT's only procurement of Double Decker buses at this juncture, and there will be procurement of new Articulated buses next year to replace the units of Articulated bus that would remain next year? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Please correct me if I am wrong. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>A Double Decker bus has one exit door.</p>
              <p>An Articulated bus has two exit doors.</p>
              <p>Technically, because it has two times the number of exit doors,
                  the unloading of passengers is <strong>two times faster</strong> for Articulated bus. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Assuming Ceteris Paribus, this
                  means that the amount of time an Articulated bus spends at a bus
                  bay is</span> <strong style="line-height: 1.231;">half</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">the time a Double Decker bus
                  spends at the bus bay. </span></p>
              <p>As less time is spent at the bus bay, an Articulated bus would
                  take a <strong>shorter time</strong> to operate <span style="line-height: 1.231;">a route, as compared to a Double Decker bus
                  operating the same route. This would therefore enable commuters to
                  get to their destination faster.</span></p>

              <p>What is there to assume in "all things held constant"?</p>
              <p>Even if all things were held constant, but then both buses have different pax distribution to start with (the shorter rear trailer for the bendy means that the rear exit door serves less people in fact), the assumption that the bendy would unload pax in HALF the time is fallacious.</p>
              <p>And yes.</p>
              <p>Like what some have mentioned here, bendies are a pain in the ass if you are in the bus behind: Most stops only allow 1 bendy a time. </p>

              <p>Because according to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> - a rather credible source that has "predicted" many new bus routes
              - it seems that SMRT is procuring Double Decker buses from two
              brands (MAN and Alexander Dennis), instead of just that one brand
              (Alexander Dennis) which we have (more) sources to confirm
              it. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>If it is true that SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker
              bus, then this may explain why the dates vary in some
              sources; <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Previously, someone
              shared with me a picture of a SMRT tender document showing that the
              Double Decker buses will be introduced in August 2014. This week,
              SMRT say that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in June
              2014. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At first, I thought that SMRT
              is accelerating the procurement process, thus they can introduce
              the Double Decker buses in June 2014. Now that I have read this
              article from <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> , I think I know why there are two different dates: SMRT is
              procuring two models of Double Decker bus. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Therefore, instead of around 100 units, <strong>SMRT is actually
              introducing around 203 units of Double Decker bus - by the end of
              this year</strong>. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Currently, according to <a title="Wikipedia" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">Wikipedia</a>, including the one with 'SMB' prefix,
              SMRT has 324 units of Articulated bus. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>On the assumption that part of the around 203 units of Double
              Decker bus will replace some units of Articulated bus, say 75% of
              them (since BSEP is primarily about enhancing existing bus
              services, then secondarily about adding new bus services), around
              152 units of Articulated bus will be replaced with around 152 units
              of Double Decker bus by the end of this year. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>But then again, I thought SMRT said that "while the
              double-deckers will be useful for adding capacity on services into
              the city, they are not as suitable for heavily-used feeder routes"
              (<a title="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers" rel="nofollow" href="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers">http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers</a>)
              - which implies that it may continue to have Articulated buses in
              its fleet? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>So, I guess SMRT wants to just reduce the composition of
              Articulated buses in its fleet, and not totally replace them with
              Double Decker buses. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Could this be SMRT's only procurement of Double Decker buses at
              this juncture, and there will be procurement of new Articulated
              buses next year to replace the units of Articulated bus that would
              remain next year? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p><br>171 &amp; 700 can't use DD because of low trees near SCGS. If anything, 61 should get them first. In fact, 61 needs 99% DD fleet.</p>

              <p><br>171 does not need DDs. 700 should have 4 DDs and can get. There is no problem. The problem of trees is more towards Newton - Little India stretch. 61 should max get 2 DDs in AM direction of BBT to Eunos and PM peak otherwise. Even if it does not get DDs it is okay. The loading does not justify. The loading for DD is only from Ngee Ann during those school timings. Why do you think SMRT not given bendies to 61 anymore? Has had only 1 bendy.</p>
              <p>Maybe you live along the route of 61 and want it for your personal reason, but there are more needy services that need DDs to start with. When SMRT procures a 400 DDs or so, then they can start experimenting on routes like 61, 965.</p>

              <p>I am confused. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>What exactly is the Double Decker bus model that SMRT is procuring? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Is it just the 103 units of <a title="Alexander Dennis Enviro500" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alexander-dennis.com/products/enviro500/">Alexander Dennis Enviro500</a> (mentioned in <a title="a Facebook post" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/ATENVIRO/posts/10152264396326469?stream_ref=5">a Facebook post</a>) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">or does it also include around 100 units of MAN Lion's City DD? </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Because according to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> - a rather credible source that has "predicted" many new bus routes - it seems that SMRT is procuring Double Decker buses from two brands (MAN and Alexander Dennis), instead of just that one brand (Alexander Dennis) which we have (more) sources to confirm it. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>If it is true that SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker bus, then this may explain why the dates vary in some sources; <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Previously, someone shared with me a picture of a SMRT tender document showing that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in August 2014. This week, SMRT say that the Double Decker buses will be introduced in June 2014. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At first, I thought that SMRT is accelerating the procurement process, thus they can introduce the Double Decker buses in June 2014. Now that I have read this article from <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2014/03/21/smrts-new-double-deck-buses/</a> , I think I know why there are two different dates: SMRT is procuring two models of Double Decker bus. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Therefore, instead of around 100 units, <strong>SMRT is actually introducing around 203 units of Double Decker bus - by the end of this year</strong>. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Currently, according to <a title="Wikipedia" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT_Buses">Wikipedia</a>, including the one with 'SMB' prefix, SMRT has 324 units of Articulated bus. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>On the assumption that part of the around 203 units of Double Decker bus will replace some units of Articulated bus, say 75% of them (since BSEP is primarily about enhancing existing bus services, then secondarily about adding new bus services), around 152 units of Articulated bus will be replaced with around 152 units of Double Decker bus by the end of this year. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>But then again, I thought SMRT said that "while the double-deckers will be useful for adding capacity on services into the city, they are not as suitable for heavily-used feeder routes" (<a title="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers" rel="nofollow" href="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers">http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-get-double-deckers</a>) - which implies that it may continue to have Articulated buses in its fleet? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>So, I guess SMRT wants to just reduce the composition of Articulated buses in its fleet, and not totally replace them with Double Decker buses. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Could this be SMRT's only procurement of Double Decker buses at this juncture, and there will be procurement of new Articulated buses next year to replace the units of Articulated bus that would remain next year? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Please correct me if I am wrong. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>

              <p>Can't solve the issue of congested interchanges if your no. of services there is high. Even if u don't use bendy, I don't think there would be much difference. </p>
              <p>The best solution is just expand your bus hubs. Nowadays, people talk about convenient.</p>

              <p><br>I am not questioning whether 67 deserves DDs. It definitely does, but the route cannot accommodate DDs because of low trees between Newton and Little India. Same reason why 48, 66 do not have DDs.</p>

              <p><br>Again, let me re-iterate. There are other services like 857/985 that deserve high capacity buses more than 61 today. The loading on sv 61 has dropped quite a lot (part of it could be people have opted for other services). Problem with 61 is also its long winding route all the way to Eunos.</p>
              <p>The route of 61 should be shortened to improve on-time arrivals. I suggest even if it does Bukit Batok to Harbourfront Interchange, it caters to most of the load. From there on you have other services.</p>

              <p><br>LTA has to build more bus interchanges and terminals. Else how is it going to accommodate 80 new services. Most interchanges are bursting already. Moreover, if it does not merge/rationalize services, you are not even going to get relief from existing services. Hence, no option but to build new terminals / interchange. I hope they have thought about it.</p>
