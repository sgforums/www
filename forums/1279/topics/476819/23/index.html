              <p>15 buses (10 DDs, 5 SDs)</p>
              <p>SMRT really needs to beef up capacity in Sungei Kadut area - so much of the area is not covered properly. Propose two routes 925 and 925M. 925 is the original route, 925M covers the missing area without going to dam area. 925M will start from CCK interchange and loop @ Kranji MRT during operation hours (only AM / PM peak). Total 15 buses with 10 DDs.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 941</span></p>
              <p>3 buses (1 DD, 2 SDs) - this service is often full with 70pax and can take a lot more. By adjusting runtime can just add 1 DD</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 945</span></p>
              <p>5 buses (5 SD, no HC bus) - this service can get 70-75 pax to Bukit Gambok for only 2 stops and otherwise has around 50-55 pax to BBT. So SDs are still doing the job until further development in the area</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 947</span></p>
              <p>4 buses (4 SD, no HC bus) - This service does get 80+ pax towards BBT interchange but given that there is 187 and 985 both in parallel with more high capacity buses in future, 947 can be full fleet SD.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 950</span></p>
              <p>12 buses (2 SD, 10 bendy) - I really wish capacity of 950 is upgraded significantly. With DDs coming in, SMRT can give its bendies to 950. You will see often 950 has no space to board at Woodlands Checkpoint. Big loss for SMRT to give revenue to other operators. Should definitely increase capacity on 950 by making it almost full fleet high capacity. 2 rigids is okay.</p>

              <p>SMRT will eventually have a fleet similar to SBS Transit's, at least in terms of the types of bus they have. So they (or their R&amp;D department) really have to find a solution to this problem. </p>
              <p>Possible solution: <strong>re-configure</strong> the seating layout at lower-deck to be similar to MRT, while <strong>maintain</strong> space for wheelchair and some seats as 'priority' (or increase the number of Priority seats, so that many more elderly passengers do not have to take the trouble to go to the upper deck).</p>
              <p>this will <strong>increase</strong> standing capacity, hence <strong>allow</strong> more space at the lower-deck for those (many) travelling short distances, while <strong>ensure</strong> space for wheelchair, and people who need to sit have seats to sit. </p>
              <p>in fact, they should do this to the single-deck buses. this will increase capacity of buses. :)</p>

              <p>Chill ppl its all just speculation on our part. There's no point
              arguing when the DDs are not even here yet.<br> <br> I believe cross-border services wont get any high capacity upgrades
              due to security issues. After passengers alight at each checkpoint,
              the BC would walk down the bus to check for any left-behind items
              in case there's any illegal items left behind. Not viable to have
              the BC check the DD/bendy at every checkpoint.<br> <br> SMRT doesnt seem interested to upgrade 950 fleet anymore, though it
              deserves a few spilts during peak hours. Might be revenue issue?
              Cause the queue is super long at Woodlands during evening
              peak.  It seem content to let ppl take 856/912/913 to the
              checkpoint.<br> <br> As for high capacity upgrades, the city/long distance routes should
              get priority on the DDs over feeders. Makes more sense to replace
              the bendies on 169,187,960,962,963,969 first if they wanna reduce
              congestions at Woodlands interchange.</p>

              <p>And also the dual lane at JB CIQ to Wdl CIQ, not really suitable for bendy buses. </p>
              <p>I think if they allow 950A which loops at JB CIQ, SMRT will be more interested. Otherwise, SMRT just leave the service as it is..</p>
