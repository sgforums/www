              <p>15 buses (10 DDs, 5 SDs)</p>
              <p>SMRT really needs to beef up capacity in Sungei Kadut area - so much of the area is not covered properly. Propose two routes 925 and 925M. 925 is the original route, 925M covers the missing area without going to dam area. 925M will start from CCK interchange and loop @ Kranji MRT during operation hours (only AM / PM peak). Total 15 buses with 10 DDs.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 941</span></p>
              <p>3 buses (1 DD, 2 SDs) - this service is often full with 70pax and can take a lot more. By adjusting runtime can just add 1 DD</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 945</span></p>
              <p>5 buses (5 SD, no HC bus) - this service can get 70-75 pax to Bukit Gambok for only 2 stops and otherwise has around 50-55 pax to BBT. So SDs are still doing the job until further development in the area</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 947</span></p>
              <p>4 buses (4 SD, no HC bus) - This service does get 80+ pax towards BBT interchange but given that there is 187 and 985 both in parallel with more high capacity buses in future, 947 can be full fleet SD.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sv 950</span></p>
              <p>12 buses (2 SD, 10 bendy) - I really wish capacity of 950 is upgraded significantly. With DDs coming in, SMRT can give its bendies to 950. You will see often 950 has no space to board at Woodlands Checkpoint. Big loss for SMRT to give revenue to other operators. Should definitely increase capacity on 950 by making it almost full fleet high capacity. 2 rigids is okay.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">12 buses (2 SD, 10 bendy) - I really wish capacity of 950 is
              upgraded significantly. With DDs coming in, SMRT can give its
              bendies to 950. You will see often 950 has no space to board at
              Woodlands Checkpoint. Big loss for SMRT to give revenue to other
              operators. Should definitely increase capacity on 950 by making it
              almost full fleet high capacity. 2 rigids is okay.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Bro, before you say thank you, got go Malaysia boh? Take a look this area towards Woodlands, @ JB CIQ.</p>
              <p>Coach buses with mostly 1 door at the front, luggages, goods etc. Before the bus hits JB CIQ, all items must be unloaded at the unloading point. This delay is roughly the same as a DD dropping it's passengers. </p>
              <p>Bendy will bring up more jams in the queue please~ <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 12.666666984558105px; line-height: 10.64199447631836px;"> </span><img style="color: #333333; font-size: 12.666666984558105px; line-height: 1.231;" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And if you dk, there's only 2 lane to the custom. If your bendy bus take more space, you are affecting the back buses from drop off still. If your bendy is trying to turn out, you're going to affect the back buses also. </p>

              <p>And you sure everyone will move up anot? Even if they would it
              would not be before the BC had to scream his lungs out for ppl to
              move up and then bus will delay again (this is what happens on 222
              most of the time). At least bendy more ppl are willing to move to
              the back. The joint wont cause any bottlenecks either.</p>

              <p>Anyway, DD is better than bendy as usual for this case. </p>
              <p>So if passengers don't move to the rear on the bendy bus, the bc need run down and scream at them lah? </p>
              <p>Come on la...at least for DD, he can just tell those infront to move up to upper deck for space. He can also check them via CCTV..where got scream lungs? </p>

              <p>I'll be frank, whenever I board 812 and 900 all the ppl would move to the back automatically. The BC dun even need worry! </p>
              <p>And I am telling the truth. I take 222 almost everyday to go out to buy lunch, and sometimes dinner. Right in the hours of school dismissal and PM peak. And guess what? This is what happened!! BC's screams heard throughout entire lower deck. Don't believe u go try from Blk 85 onwards towards Bedok Stn? Bet u will cry uh. </p>

              <p>Actually to sum up everything I remain firm that short segments or routes that have high demand should use bendies as the pax do not travel far. It serves like a tram shuttle system that ferries the passenger, nothing more, which serves the primary purpose of public transport! I mean come on, would you really rather climbing up, sit for less than 15 mins (provided no jams), and then squeeze/wait your way down, to just straightaway boarding and alighting from third door? And for other svcs, just a few steps further down and then alighting from third door? I doubt so. </p>

              <p>CORRECT, <strong>BUT</strong></p>
              <p>Your JB CIQ have a long queue for coach buses and those public ones. You can't expect to drive a bendy in there and add spaces. Everyone got to wait in the queue, even if you finish unloading your passengers. </p>
              <p>Having a bendy there may cause the back buses not to have the chance to unload it's passengers. Further more, you still got to turn to join the queue. Even if u turn 3/4 of your bus to the queue, ur back is still obstructing..</p>
