              <p><strong>Now it's not about the road problems and car problems</strong>.
              Population problems, yes. Unless you can vote out the government to
              stop their scheme in increasing the population. </p>
              <p>The problems caused by bendies is obvious in places where public
              buses use only,where  other vehicles are out of bounds, like
              interchanges,  depots, bus lanes and stops. And they affect
              other buses and bus services  as well. If SMRT still insist
              it's own way of operations and not contributing to improving it's
              bus services as a whole with LTA and SBST, sooner or later, SMRT
              might as well stop operating bus services. </p>
              <p>Well, probably that might be a blessing in disguise. </p>

              <p>I believe SMRT do see the needs, but where's the money? Their train also kinda crappy, most of it are old trains(C151). Plus the buses, tracks etc., all requires big cost.</p>
              <p>SBST is rather "organised" in the sense that they focus much on land transport and bits on railway. Plus, their 2 railways are rather new. Their bus models(before KUB enters) are rather narrowed, majority Volvos. This makes operations easier. </p>
              <p>SMRT wise, they handle the first railways line which lasted for more than 20years(correct me if I'm wrong). Their fleet are all "second hand" type, from TIBs. The wrong move by TIBs is to introduce multi-model fleet at the start of the operation. Even if TIBs can handle it, but can the new comer, SMRT, handle it? </p>
              <p>Plus LTA, given their years of expert in handing the land transport. Aren't they able to answer why are there major breakdowns or at least compare the past n present? </p>

              <p>As I have said earlier,  facilities like bus interchanges, depots, bus lanes and stops are out of bounds to other vehicles. But because of the use of bendies, operations screws up because of bus queues,  jams and delays caused by bendies. </p>

              <p>Although SBST may not be the world's best bus operator, but at least it has proven to be much reliable out of the 2 in Singapore. </p>

              <p>Hmm I don't see it that way. They are rather organised is rather due lesser multi-models fleet in the past. Even their bendy are from Volvo. And I guess the bendy are rejected as most of their route requires higher capacity buses(DD). [bolded para]</p>
              <p>SMRT can introduce DD, but the problem is the difficulties in turning over the fleet with limited amount of $$...</p>
              <p>Anyway, in this case, we shouldn't talk about which company is more successful. Both operators are handling different types of fleet leh :o </p>

              <p>Don't even see the need for bendy friendly interchanges. What if SBST takes over these places or some of the services one day? And LTA now has more pressing issues to improve services reliability, making things standardised will only help them achieve things faster,  not the other way round. </p>
              <p>It's wasting many limited land space just to cater for bendies where they can be used to build other more useful structures, like hospitals. And building standardised bus facilities helps to make planning easier, more efficient and less costly. </p>
              <p>Suicide is an overstatement. In that case, all SBST feeders and intratown services will have gone terribly bad. But in fact, they still operates better than SMRT, with better frequency SDs, and they are still successful in using DDs on these services too. It is all about how SMRT wants to operate and standardised their fleet to make their planning and management easier, more organised and less costly.</p>
              <p>Stop living in the past and think of the future. Given SMRT current situation,  it is better that they better buck up and makes their operations planning easier to manage to stop giving more screw ups. Be realistic. </p>

              <p>Hmm I don't see it that way. They are rather organised is rather due lesser multi-models fleet in the past. Even their bendy are from Volvo. And I guess the bendy are rejected as most of their route requires higher capacity buses(DD). [bolded para]</p>
              <p>SMRT can introduce DD, but the problem is the difficulties in turning over the fleet with limited amount of $$...</p>

              <p>Money is not a problem for SMRT, since it can reap millions of annual profits. Problem is: do they have the heart and sincerity to walk the talk or just being NATO about improving its bus services. Now is the best time for them to switch to DDs, since all of their bendies are to be scrapped within the next 5 years. </p>
