              <p>I don't understand why you always have to be so rude and hostile. Even if you disagree with others, there are nicer ways to articulate your viewpoints. And I certainly don't mean this instance alone. I normally just surf the Singapore Buses forum but I felt compelled to express my displeasure at you just this once. People like you are the reason why the bus community has never had any semblance of harmony ever since it started to make use of the Internet to facilitate discussions. I really don't think it's that difficult to show some etiquette. Imagine if you were to engage in such name-calling or make such childish remarks at the workplace - you'd most likely have a short-lived presence there.</p>

              <p>PLEASE GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF. </p>
              <p>I'm fucking tired of having to read your absolutely arrogant and sarcastic remarks. Man has its limits and thanks, you've pushed mine to the limit today.</p>
              <p>Throughout the "Volvo won't be purchased" and "LTA approved bendies anot" posts you've called me disgusting names like a joke and stupid. Well I'm dont care about those petty words but what I fucking hate is how you go back on your word and call ME name-calling and still call other people names yourself! All I have called you is a hypocrite, which OFC you are, thinking you are very pro and trying to be stubborn and hard-necked and argue what the other users have so observed and thought of you!</p>
              <p>Trust me, the user scolded you for a reason. I have in no way offended you when I was replying to your post on LTA bendies and better still, replying to OTHERS, and now you came and call me names, and then say I called YOU the names. This is really horrible. Like how you said you were a "peacemaker" and you still get into flame wars with other users around. </p>
              <p>And BTW, on factual errors. I mean, why not YOU tell me how and WHY would SMRT wanna get a Volvo? YOU PROVE TO ME LAH. All these while it's always MB or MAN, no Volvo. Leave alone a B9TL. You just came and called me stupid and went off without really telling me if SMRT will really buy a Volvo. Doesn't that makes you a hypocrite?</p>
              <p>Dont think you are the rightful one here coz you are NOT. Not that I am the correct one, but why not try asking other seniors on what THEY think of YOU. </p>
              <p>You will know, and you will learn more than just being a total jerk around. </p>

              <p>I'm fucking tired of having to read your absolutely arrogant and sarcastic remarks. Man has its limits and thanks, you've pushed mine to the limit today.</p>
              <p>Throughout the "Volvo won't be purchased" and "LTA approved bendies anot" posts you've called me disgusting names like a joke and stupid. Well I'm dont care about those petty words but what I fucking hate is how you go back on your word and call ME name-calling and still call other people names yourself! All I have called you is a hypocrite, which OFC you are, thinking you are very pro and trying to be stubborn and hard-necked and argue what the other users have so observed and thought of you!</p>
              <p>Trust me, the user scolded you for a reason. I have in no way offended you when I was replying to your post on LTA bendies and better still, replying to OTHERS, and now you came and call me names, and then say I called YOU the names. This is really horrible. Like how you said you were a "peacemaker" and you still get into flame wars with other users around. </p>
              <p>And BTW, on factual errors. I mean, why not YOU tell me how and WHY would SMRT wanna get a Volvo? YOU PROVE TO ME LAH. All these while it's always MB or MAN, no Volvo. Leave alone a B9TL. You just came and called me stupid and went off without really telling me if SMRT will really buy a Volvo. Doesn't that makes you a hypocrite?</p>
              <p>Dont think you are the rightful one here coz you are NOT. Not that I am the correct one, but why not try asking other seniors on what THEY think of YOU. </p>
              <p>You will know, and you will learn more than just being a total jerk around. </p>

              <p>I believe SMRT is allowed to purchase bendies for replacement of
              older bendies, while the dds are funded by the government under LTA

              SMRT working together to bring in high capacity buses in 2014.</p>

              <p>There won't be any more new bendies from SMRT anymore. </p>
              <p>Firstly LTA does not support the use of bbendies, because LTA and SMRT needs more spaces for more buses and services. And they do not want more delays and long bus queues caused by bendies in bus interchanges and bus lanes.</p>
              <p>And I heard that SMRT does not like the A24, so most likely it will be returned to the manufacturer or sold in future elsewhere, like 998 and 999.</p>
              <p>And it won't be cost effective for SMRT to operate both models in the long run, since SMRTB is still making losses. If it continues to operates this way, SMRTB is bound to close down in near future. </p>
              <p>Thus SMRT choose to operate dds in future, with the current bendies serve till their end of their 17 years lifespan and gets replaces by DDs and SDs. </p>

              <p>I am not trying to side with anyone here, but as things are getting out of control here, let me have a chance of showing everyone here some facts...</p>
              <p>Firstly, with regards to SMB128B's comment about SMRT not purchasing Volvo buses regardless of whether they are SDs and DDs, I have to say I remembered someone else saying that SMRT is unlikely to purchase Volvo (definitely the latter is not SMB128B), although both users have different levels of opinion (e.g. one person say the company is unlikely to purchase that brand of buses, another saying that the same company definitely won't purchase the same brand of buses). For this I may not be able to express much...although the users expressed the same sort of views.</p>
              <p>Secondly, how many senior bus fans have made their opinion that they think SMRT will purchase both DDs and bendies? So does it mean that someone has to simply create even more flame posts to deal with every single one of them and argue against their point of stand? I also basically feel the same way as SBS9C and the others, regardless of whichever way SMRT will utilise their future DDs and bendies. Furthermore, although I also don't know how long will the trial for SMB388S last, but if people think logically, the first production batch of the bendies actually came in more than one year after the demonstrator bendy is registered, and I believe the trial for the bendy bus has not yet been over since one year has not been up yet.</p>
              <p>I somehow have gotten what's going on that eventually led to these series of flame wars that spanned across at least 3 threads (or maybe more)...basically some disagreements, misunderstanding (mistaking a newcomer to be a clone account), but I do see that in the case of recalling the past (referring to SMB128B's post about service 371 not being the same as service 163M), I don't see there's anything wrong with that. Although there's a saying that we should forget the past and look forward to tomorrow, but this isn't used on the context of forgetting memorable experiences!</p>
              <p>I just wanted to settle things here at once so that I don't wish to waste my strength on typing these lengthy paragraphs...and inviting unwanted trouble. Whoever wants to disagree with me can simply write in a kind and friendly manner.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>It's either the govt. do something to the population and the cars or prepare for the worst. No point switching from bendy to DD when your road is still freaking crowded, people are all packed in sardines of moving containers or even boxes... </p>
              <p>Anyway, both operators, especially SMRT, may even lose more profit when LTA introduce more schemes. </p>
              <p>Now they remove the bendy, what's next? Remove WAB area? Or create more standees in the DD? Or best, passengers can stand on the upper deck legally? Not quite a win-win situation here duh...</p>

              <p>Now it's not about the road problems and car problems. Population problems, yes. Unless you can vote out the government to stop their scheme in increasing the population. </p>
              <p>The problems caused by bendies is obvious in places where public buses use only,where  other vehicles are out of bounds, like interchanges,  depots, bus lanes and stops. And they affect other buses and bus services  as well. If SMRT still insist it's own way of operations and not contributing to improving it's bus services as a whole with LTA and SBST, sooner or later, SMRT might as well stop operating bus services. </p>
