              <p>SMRT should not rush the introduction of Double Decker buses into its fleet, to avoid the buses breaking down and/or malfunctioning when they are in service.</p>
              <p>Actually, I feel that SMRT will continue to have Articulated buses in its fleet, and there will be batches of new Articulated buses added to its fleet in future. While the Double Deckers will cover the primary role of Articulated buses - of being high capacity buses - they will not eliminate Articulated buses from SMRT's fleet.</p>
              <p>Based on the news report mentioning SMRT's concern that Double Decker buses may not be suitable for short bus routes, I guess the Double Decker buses would be complementary to the Articulated buses, instead of being substitutes.</p>
              <p>Double Decker buses for roads more congested, which are usually those in the city and industrial areas, where large volumes of people go to work everyday. This would save road space, reducing traffic congestion and <strong>possibly lower ERP rates and COE prices</strong>. </p>
              <p>Articulated buses for roads less congested, which are usually those in the residential areas.</p>
              <p>meanwhile, the 12-metre buses can fill in the gap, for service during off-peak periods and/or at routes with relatively low ridership - which do not require high capacity buses.</p>

              <p>SBS Transit should learn from SMRT - on how they allocate the various bus types to its routes based on traffic conditions, and with consideration for its commuters - and also introduce (re-introduce) Articulated buses into its fleet. </p>
              <p>Similarly, SBS Transit can consider having Articulated buses for its feeder services that need high capacity buses. This would benefit commuters on short routes, and also people who are unable (or have difficulty) climbing stairs.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Double Decker buses can be re-allocated to trunk routes, where some of them are in need of higher frequencies.</p>

              <p>Bro like ur comments, SMRT will have new articulated buses for sure. However, traffic congestion in SG is here to stay, it is how the gahmen manage the traffic and whether they would implement FULL DAY bus lanes(unbroken)in SG</p>

              <p>Fully agreed, and yes SBST should trial bendies once more. Remember, the bendies left at a time the population barely hit 4 million. With all these new flats and new immigrants and citizens, it's time to stop using all-rigid fleet for most of its feeders and consider bendies which are more efficient in terms of short-haul, compared to both DDs and rigids. </p>

              <p>Fully agreed, and yes SBST should trial bendies once more.
              Remember, the bendies left at a time the population barely hit 4

              it's time to stop using all-rigid fleet for most of its feeders and
              consider bendies which are more efficient in terms of short-haul,
              compared to both DDs and rigids. </p>

              <p>You don't get me. </p>
              <p>I am well aware that the DDs at most times are relatively filled (not <strong>always</strong> full mind you). </p>
              <p>My point is that it takes FOREVER to unload at Bedok Stn. </p>
              <p>Did a timing at Bedok Stn timing a full loaded 222 remaining at the bus stop versus a full loaded 913 at Admiralty Stn. Both at 7.30 am. 222: 1 min 43s. 913? Only 57s! </p>
              <p>You have to know that there is only one door and so everyone will have to cram there to alight. It is impossible to alight through the front door as there are a few people going to Fengshan boarding from the front (thus blocking the front) and anyways very seldom will the pax really alight from the front as you have a very narrow aisle to the entrance door, as compared to a relatively wider aisle in a bendy.</p>
              <p>As you have said, the upper decks are well filled or even full, making the alighting from the upper deck through the narrow staircase even longer! And you still have passengers below, who need to share a single exit with the upper deck pax! Furthermore, getting down the stairs is not an easy task when you have people in front and behind you. Your footsteps becomes slower just as to not trip over etc. And since it's peak hours you still have ladies wearing high heels (I'm not exaggerating here, it happens)!</p>
              <p>Based on the above, I'm not surprised that unloading DDs takes longer than bendies. And you have said about the number of buses at Bedok. Yes, there are, so you gonna have a bus clogging up space for a good two minutes?! Oh so this is how you relieve congestion uh? Besides, the stops at Bedok Stn is actually meant for three buses. So even if you have a bendy you can still have another rigid with ease. After all, what are the odds a 222 will meet a 67 bendy? I'll tell you, that's hardly the case. Most of the bus 67s that actually meet are surprisingly rigids. But by occupying space less than a rigid extra you save a minute at the stop and free up lots of space afterwards!</p>
              <p>And I'm not biased towards bendies. If I am I would have asked for all DDs to replaced with bendies. Did I do that? No!! I was merely suggesting bendies to be used on services that deserved it. So get that clear. </p>

              <p>Yeah perhaps SBST may not be getting bendies anymore. Though IMO it should, let's just stick to the fact that the benefits of bendies does not justify a major fleet overhaul for SBST. </p>
              <p>However, due to the exact same reasons, SMRT should also not have DDs in its feeders and Intratowns. Needless to say, advantages above and mentioned before. </p>
