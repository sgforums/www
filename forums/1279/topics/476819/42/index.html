              <p>other percent will go to another new big bus operator company soon. not always must SBST or SMRT. their licence is due soon so LTA might tender for another one or two new operators with both SBST or SMRT togethers. so could be up to 7 operators as the minister said in the news. Most of the new buses will be shared and new ones will added in if needed. There might be new market for bus maintenance companies as LTA will tender for bus maintenance. So the operators will never own the buses but loan from LTA. don't forget when MRT lines are fully operated there is no need for long distant route so most of them will be med or short route no need so much big buses like DD. maybe bendy buses will be useful. in case of MRT breakdown can still use them. </p>

              bro i agree this order is definitely not enough coz sg population looks like can compete with HK soon. but i believe for bendys is only initial order to replace the 1st gen ones. but more worrying is they still got a large order for SD 12m buses. if ask me; i think a LE bus is overall still better than fully lowfloor ones. but no one dare to make this decision only.

                  sorry bro coz i am partial colour blind. i thought it was black. hmm. maroon seems a better colour to replace the silver background to look more modern? i think if choose cool colour; the livery should all be cool colours and vice versa.

              power wright DD bus. look like the coming back of Mercedes DD
              bus.this is the type of bus SMRT should get for the
              future. </span><span style="color: #444444; font-family: StagSans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;">Maximum
              passenger capacity on the bus we inspected was shown as 63 seats
              plus 38 standees, a total of 101, but this may not be the final
              figure. Wrightbus will only claim 99 as a definite passenger
              capacity for the time being but it may be that they will be able to
              offer a three figure capability.</span></p>

              <p>use your brain this bus just a demo model to show off customer wright new design. Maybe SBST and SMRT are thinking of getting this body with air-con fix in for the new DD buses? the narrow window on the bus mean it can block sun light for singapore road which is good for comfort riding.   </p>

              <p>This is easy. Paste the new operator's logo over the existing livery until they get a new paint job (in this case, the government livery). Transdev Melbourne did exactly that when they took over from multiple operators.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely why Transperth lagi best. The only indication of the operator's identity is a small sticker in the window that says "This Transperth bus service is proudly operated by Path Transit/Swan Transit/Transdev". Since the private contractors do not own the fleet, they do not get to put their own liveries on the vehicles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the same note, I am in favour of nationalising the entire public bus fleet in Singapore and adopting Transitlink (LTA) livery for them. Even if SBS and SMB are operating and maintaining the buses, they still do not get to paint their logo on the vehicles and can only put a sticker in the window for differentiation.</p>

              <p>other percent will go to another new big bus operator company soon. not always must SBST or SMRT. their licence is due soon so LTA might tender for another one or two new operators with both SBST or SMRT togethers. so could be up to 7 operators as the minister said in the news. Most of the new buses will be shared and new ones will added in if needed. There might be new market for bus maintenance companies as LTA will tender for bus maintenance. So the operators will never own the buses but loan from LTA. don't forget when MRT lines are fully operated there is no need for long distant route so most of them will be med or short route no need so much big buses like DD. maybe bendy buses will be useful. in case of MRT breakdown can still use them. </p>
