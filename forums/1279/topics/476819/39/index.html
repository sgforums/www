              <p>According to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/volvo-b9tl/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/</a>, "the Volvo B9TL Wright has a licensed capacity for 131 passengers, comprising of 55 upper deck seating, 27 lower deck seating, 49 standing passengers and a single wheelchair."</p>
              <p>Comparing to B9TL Wright, Enviro500 MMC/NG has the same number of seats at upper deck, two less seats at lower deck and can accomodate 9 less number of Standing passengers;<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Enviro500 MMC/NG can accomodate 11 less passengers than B9TL Wright.</span></p>
              <p>It may seem that Enviro500 MMC/NG has a smaller capacity than B9TL Wright, but if you noticed, there is no mention about how many wheelchair users can be on Enviro500 MMC/NG at the same time.</p>
              <p>The smaller capacity at lower deck could be due to Enviro500 MMC/NG having the capacity to accomodate one more Wheelchair user. The wheelchair space might have been counted into the figures, thus the capacity is smaller.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, if you commute on the buses during peak hours, you would know that most of the Wheelchair users do not commute on the buses during peak hours. On the assumption that two people can stand at one wheelchair space during peak hours when the Wheelchair users usually do not commute on the buses, there can be four more people standing at the lower deck of Enviro500 MMC/NG (if it has space for two wheelchair users) during peak hours - the bus actually has capacity for 128 people, which is quite similar to the capacity (131) of BTL9 Wright. </p>
              <p>Besides the provision for wheelchair users, the smaller seating capacity at lower deck could also be due to other reasons, such as </p>
              <ol>
              <li>the <strong>staircase may be less steep</strong>/of smaller gradient; occupies more horizontal space - people with difficulties walking may find it easier to climb up to the upper deck. </li>
              <li>the <strong>lower deck may be 100% step-free all the way</strong> to the last row of seats - ramp all the way, thus more space for less seats - suitable for people who have difficulties walking and may not have energy to climb up and down. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>By the way, I would like to know how the Standing capacity is measured.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> As the size of human beings is different across the world, the standing capacity indicated may not be the same as the number of people that can actually stand at the lower deck. </span></p>
              <p>If the standing capacity of Enviro500 MMC/NG is measured differently than how that of B9TL Wright is measured, we are not able to compare the standing capacity of these two bus models using the figures provided, and the only way to compare is to wait for Enviro500 MMC/NG to enter service in Singapore and physically board the bus during peak hour to count the number of people standing when the bus is packed, while we do the same for B9TL Wright.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the capacity of Enviro500 MMC/NG that we know could indicate a few possible features of the bus, such as having space for two wheelchair users, being 100% step-free and having a staircase of smaller gradient. This may mean that Enviro500 MMC/NG is more user-friendly than B9TL Wright.</p>

              <p>According to <a title="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/volvo-b9tl/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/</a>,
              "the Volvo B9TL Wright has a licensed capacity for 131 passengers,
              comprising of 55 upper deck seating, 27 lower deck seating, 49
              standing passengers and a single wheelchair."</p>
              <p>Comparing to B9TL Wright, Enviro500 MMC/NG has the same number
              of seats at upper deck, two less seats at lower deck and can
              accomodate 9 less number of Standing passengers;<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Enviro500 MMC/NG can accomodate 11 less
              passengers than B9TL Wright.</span></p>
              <p>It may seem that Enviro500 MMC/NG has a smaller capacity than
              B9TL Wright, but if you noticed, there is no mention about how many
              wheelchair users can be on Enviro500 MMC/NG at the same time.</p>
              <p>The smaller capacity at lower deck could be due to Enviro500
              MMC/NG having the capacity to accomodate one more Wheelchair user.
              The wheelchair space might have been counted into the figures, thus
              the capacity is smaller.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, if you commute on the buses during peak hours, you
              would know that most of the Wheelchair users do not commute on the
              buses during peak hours. On the assumption that two people can
              stand at one wheelchair space during peak hours when the Wheelchair
              users usually do not commute on the buses, there can be four more
              people standing at the lower deck of Enviro500 MMC/NG (if it has
              space for two wheelchair users) during peak hours - the bus
              actually has capacity for 128 people, which is quite similar to the
              capacity (131) of BTL9 Wright. </p>
              <p>Besides the provision for wheelchair users, the smaller seating
              capacity at lower deck could also be due to other reasons, such
              as </p>
              <ol>
              <li>the <strong>staircase may be less steep</strong>/of smaller
              gradient; occupies more horizontal space - people with difficulties
              walking may find it easier to climb up to the upper
              deck. </li>
              <li>the <strong>lower deck may be 100% step-free all the
              way</strong> to the last row of seats - ramp all the way, thus more
              space for less seats - suitable for people who have difficulties
              walking and may not have energy to climb up and down. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>By the way, I would like to know how the Standing capacity is
              measured.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> As the size of
              human beings is different across the world, the standing capacity
              indicated may not be the same as the number of people that can
              actually stand at the lower deck. </span></p>
              <p>If the standing capacity of Enviro500 MMC/NG is measured
              differently than how that of B9TL Wright is measured, we are not
              able to compare the standing capacity of these two bus models using
              the figures provided, and the only way to compare is to wait for
              Enviro500 MMC/NG to enter service in Singapore and physically board
              the bus during peak hour to count the number of people standing
              when the bus is packed, while we do the same for B9TL Wright.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the capacity of Enviro500 MMC/NG that we know could
              indicate a few possible features of the bus, such as having space
              for two wheelchair users, being 100% step-free and having a
              staircase of smaller gradient. This may mean that Enviro500 MMC/NG
              is more user-friendly than B9TL Wright.</p>

              <p>In my observation, the max a Wright can intake is 122-124 pax on the upper limit. I have done many dd loading observations and this is realistic number. 131 is imflated number just like 90 pax on Citaro which at max can take 68-70 pax and KUB which at max takes 72 - 74 pax if people really squeeze to the back.</p>
