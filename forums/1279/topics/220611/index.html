            <div class='col-md body'>Haha... In North America and Europe, it is quite common to see BCs greeting passengers. On many occasions, the BCs and the passengers even chit-chat.... (on weather, on politics, on everyday stuffs, etc)<br><br>But in Asia (e.g. Singapore, HK, China, Malaysia, etc) BCs greeting passengers is quite rare. In some places such as HK, BCs are not even supposed to talk during driving (for safety reasons). Then, there are some BCs who are rude (such as the 147 BC who took a passenger's Ez-link card and got beaten up, and many other cases posted in the forum... In fact, this forum seems to contain more complaints than compliments.) I hope to see more courteous BCs in Singapore, such as those mentioned in the previous posts...</div>
