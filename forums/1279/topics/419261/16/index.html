              <p>Just came back</p>
              <p>Dunno wat's SLBP really doing. Not a single 179A appeared.</p>
              <p>By the time I gave up observing, a total of 400 ppl were stranded at NTU. Outside I saw so many empty 241 towards Jurong N9, brunching somemore.</p>
              <p>It's back to square one.</p>
              <p>I bet SLBP is only dispatching 50% of the planned capacity onto 179.</p>
              <p>I dun understand why SLBP love to dispatch buses onto 179 instead. It ends up those ppl who stays at Jurong N7, N8, N6 deprived of a chance to board the bus. If they more garang dispatch more 179A by force, then those ppl and at Pioneer Rd Nth bus stop has better boarding chances.</p>
              <p>Like I've said, chicken n egg problem.</p>
              <p>I dunno wat's w/ ppl at SLBP, as if it's so efficient to make ppl wait 30 mins for 1 bus.</p>

              <p>I believe you are talking about the PM Peak. I heard from some BC that many of the 179s are stuck at NTU. The passenger volume was recorded high but what can be done is to build longer bus stops in NTU. Buses are usually late and can't get back on schedule and also can't park at BNL for long time. What can be done will be transferring 179 back to the temp int which is impossible.</p>
              <p>Similar incident also happen between the bus stop opp Clementi MRT bound SIM/Ngee Ann in the morning and vice-versa. I heard students complained that they had to wait for close to 30 mins in the morning peak at Clementi to board a bus. In the evening, students at Ngee Ann bus stop are also left stranded at the bus stop. Part of the reason is also the Jam in the evening. With close to 5 services serving along Clementi Rd, there are also similar incident in other part of the schools. This can likely be solved if MRT could be extend to these areas.</p>
              <p>Empty 241 will occur from BNL to N9 and brunching was due to the previous bus was late. I had observed this trend where the 179 S or E shift buses start their crossover to 241 are late and caused such problem. There are also notable high capacity between 4 - 5pm from N9 to Pioneer/BNL. Not to mention about the real business from 6pm - 7.30pm.</p>

              <p>The problem I've noticed is rather the buses are not dispatched accordingly. There's more 179 dispatched these days.</p>
              <p>I admit there's p-t students heading in, but there's way more heading out. Furthermore I've said bef, there's no pt even if students prefer by dispatching more 179.</p>
              <p>179A empty buses picking up ppl from either Nth or South Spine (downroute) clears the crowd faster than waiting for ppl to alight 1st (179).</p>
              <p>179A issue is because timekeeper dun want to dispatch buses by timing. They always wait till like ADD load to dispatch during the lower demand time slot. Ends up the buses are dispatched like 15 mins behind scheduled.</p>
              <p>Ends up these buses cannot do the 179 trips bet 0930 - 1020 on time. This slow is supposed to be 2 mins headways.</p>

              <p><br>As mentioned earlier, empty 241 will occur from BNL to N9 and buses will come together due to the previous bus was late or having high passenger capacity. I had observed this trend where the 179 S or E shift buses start their crossover to 241 are late and caused such problem. Currently, some BC and I also discover an increase in no of ppl leaving N9 during 1800-1915. </p>

              <p>As for MRT...</p>
              <p>I've said over NTU's jioing to LTA to give them a LRT. For NTU's case it's pretty simple, for 1/2 of the year NTU is in recess, what are they going to do w/ e LRT trains? Furthermore an LRT can only carry some 90 pax vs ADD's 120 pax.</p>
              <p>As for Clementi Rd, I do not see a point into building an LRT or spur line for now. I think tabulating the cost and benefits does not balance</p>

              <p><br>problem is w/ tat kind of fleet size &amp; 15 mins peak freq, it's very difficult to maintain</p>
              <p>I've done a worst case type of scheduling for 178 ever before. It's like 14A/ 14 P, 4 S required. Tat's like 14 - 15 mins PM peak freq.</p>
              <p>But I believe headways could be improved further if I go on more into differentating the running time.</p>
