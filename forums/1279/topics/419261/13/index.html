              <p>Surprisingly they dragged the S102 slot to start at around 1515 and start trip at about 1650 and calls out from my side, but well, That worked as the timing was right and got many crowds, and hope they won't complain the frequency after this though, but the bad thing is all buses got dragged which means some slots got swapped.</p>

              <p>A 20 year old Chinese man was arrested for trying to kiss a 28 year old female passenger on a SBST bus. The incident happened on Tuesday, around 9pm on a 161 DD. The bus was travelling along HG Ave 4, and the man walked to the door, wanting to alight when he suddenly grabbed a woman's hand and leaned over in a bid to kiss her. The woman managed to fend him off and told the BC about it. The BC stopped the bus immediately and locked the man alone in the bus after telling the other passengers to alight.</p>
              <p>While waiting for the police to arrive, the man became teary as he sat on the seat the woman had occupied. Other passengers said the man looked decent but his actions were shocking, and it was lucky that the woman had reacted in time to push him away.</p>
