              <p>SLBP again Woah iris has helped me. SLBP has indeed gerrymander with bus schedule by swapping 179A trips into 179. Ends up 179 is abt 10% underoperated.</p>
              <p>Ends up erratic waiting time, ppl at downstream incl Pioneer Rd Nth cannot board again. Afternoon peak, throw lagi more 179A into 179.</p>
              <p>Make underoperating condition even worst.Â Seems the ppl dispatching created the mess. Dispatching 179A only whenÂ more than ADD loadÂ are queueing and overloading the bus. Though a no of ppl gotta squeeze thru to alight at Hall 6. Upper deck n staircase can have 6 - 8 ppl standing.</p>
              <p>At this moment, long queue for 179. Ends up with the hoard at Pioneer, ppl at Pioneer Rd Nth can never board the bus. In fact, Pioneer is another mess as 255 &amp; 257 all faces delays thanks to NTU. We build a bus int and ppl want to cluster for buses at small bus stops.</p>
              <p>While 179 speed across Pioneer Rd Nth, now anyÂ 179A takes 5 mins longer to travel vsÂ empty 179. I do understand 179's AM peak freq is 5 mins, but it ends up at 3 mins.</p>
              <p>Gerrymander that they dun even know 179A do crossover to 179 for 1 more trip up to 1030. No wonder the off peak freq can go into 10 mins headways n w/o brunching.</p>
              <p>Might as well SLBP go withdraw 179A, make everyon's travelling to stop at every single bus stop. So gang kor for what.</p>
              <p>I've this to say, you think by adding more 179 to solve the problem, you're wrong. Ends up the travelling time is so much longer, how to replan the schedule? Most pax on 179 x-fer to the MRT network, why incurr turnaround time at every bus stop as ppl are alighting? An empty 179A can clear the crowd so much faster.</p>
              <p>Ends up buses more n more lambat, withdraw 179A during certain period, last 179A goes missing. The 2000 busÂ kenaÂ replaced by 179 downroute.</p>
              <p>I dun see the SLBP timekeepers gerrymander with Sv 199 which has a generalised 25% loading during the same period, I dun see them hoarding to keep 199 to dispatch at every 8 mins instead of 5 mins.</p>
              <p>179 &amp; 179A's taiji is basically the same problem w/ 160 &amp; 170 in the past.</p>
              <p>The plan of 179A's downroute is to reduce bus turnaround time, but SLBP seems not to understand this. I think it's because the mindset 179 is not profitable. Like this lagi unprofitable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Actually in the first place, I think 255 &amp; 257 also kena lambat as they get stucked w/ the NTU load at Pioneer. Ends up sometimes 255 or 257 BC would overtake the 179 (2nd in bay) make ppl walk into bus bay to board e bus.</p>
              <p>That's why NTU load should be barred from using Pioneer, ends up make 241, 255 &amp; 257 lambat like siao.</p>

              <p>This is the supposed freq of 179A &amp; 179.</p>
              <p>PM peak: 179 6 mins (iris). 179A 3-4 mins (iris).</p>
              <p>But SLBP makes it 3 mins, 2 - 30 mins.</p>
              <p>There's no net increase of buses, someÂ buses go over to 241, go gerrymander by switching the bus to inccur travelling time into NTU on 179 and back.</p>
              <p>No wonder it's no more smooth bus ops and underoperating situation.</p>
              <p>That's why some ppl think by making info restricted you think it's better. Ends up now things not properly managed, how to get an outsider to take a look at what's going on seriously.</p>
              <p>Oh how I know it's tio swapped. Simply put, sometimes a 179A desto bus can appear w/ paper blocking the 'A' or even the iris would jump literally. The 4 &amp; 5Â mins at South Spine for 179A can remain there, 179 shows 6 &amp; 12 resp. Later the 179A becomes 4 &amp; 8. The 179 nowÂ becomes Arr &amp; 6.</p>
              <p>The 179A bus took 16 mins to appear and it's only 1, apparently no downroute made.</p>

              <p>Then I noticed at BNL</p>
              <p>The front 2x 179 arrived BNL at e same time, loading wise can fill to abt 80 - 100 ppl.</p>
              <p>Had 179A been properly dispatched do theseÂ ppl need to incurr the additional travelling time? Do ppl at Pioneer Rd Nth or Hall 4 have to suffer unable to board the buses aft buses when these ppl should have boarded 179A?</p>
              <p>That's why that's what a schedule is for.</p>
              <p>Yah, I dun wish to reveal such ops lapses over here. But looks like it's alrdy weeks and the bus dispatch is getting to becoming another Sv 170.</p>

              <p>Is it cos they're studying at Sth Spine and ended up deprived of a boarding chance? It's becoming 179 for N Spine exclusively, fill to the brim.</p>
              <p>2) How come there's ppl pressing bell of 179A's outbound? Is it because desperately any buses just board cos they couldn't board 179 at Sth Spine?</p>

              <p><br>Cos the buses are not properly dispatched, dun forget I've said 179A buses would crossover to 179 to do 1 morning AM trip.</p>
              <p>That's when e problem comes, if the days do not see proper 179A dispatch, prepare that the rest of the day will see erratic bus freq. Evening would see 179AÂ  going ninja to get them to 179 to plug the gap.</p>
              <p>6-7pm there's alrdy 179 @ 5 mins I believe. Right now SLBP is operating at 0 - 5 mins at expense of 179A.</p>
              <p>I've seen 179 being held up at N Spine for 4 mins as ppl need to alight and clear the crowd. There was no 179A to clear the crowd at all.</p>
              <p>Dun think it'sÂ ppl end class irregularly, I'm not too sure about this matter.</p>
              <p>Also reminds me of tis, 179 &amp; 179A's timetable is actually given to PTC as like any other bus sv, mandering it wun do anything good.</p>
