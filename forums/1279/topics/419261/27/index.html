              <p>I undersatnd that you are trying to say that some of the buses with new seat covers feels like the ones on the OCs while some don't. In this case, we don't care about the hardness or softness, we just refer to them as "new (insert type of seat covers - though currently they are using OC style seat covers) style seat covers"</p>

              <p>I undersatnd that you are trying to say that some of the buses with new seat covers feels like the ones on the OCs while some don't. In this case, we don't care about the hardness or softness, we just refer to them as "new (insert type of seat covers - though currently they are using OC style seat covers) seat covers"</p>

              <p>As far as I remember, nope. What I'm wondering is the reason why the Volgren rigids have the third brake light, and one possibility is that they may be sent to do 950 in future.

              <p>TIBS purchased the Volgren O405 in 1998 and they were already fitted with 3rd brake lights. Even the O405G bodied by Volgren that arrived in 2000 came with 3rd brake lights.</p>
              <p>And, the current 950 was only introduced after SMRT took over in 2004.</p>
