              <p>BNL Int AM peak</p>
              <p>179 &amp; 182 cannot be together one. Sv 179 BCs woud love to
              horn, horn, horn @ 182.</p>
              <p>They must be thinking 182 low demand. But a MK4 can be filled to
              e entrance.</p>
              <p>I think SBS should consider alternate downroute for 179
              from Jurong West St 63. The 179A is alrdy meant to allow ppl
              downstream to be able to board 179. Let those students queue should
              they decide to queue for 179 on basis '179A too long'. Seriously
              how fast you're cleared on 179A <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">.</p>
              <p>Even I noticed it's becoming a problem. PM peak outbound NTU
              students lub to take 179 to Pioneer. Ends up those who really need
              179 at South Spine are deprived a boarding chance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Evening: 182, 243G, 179 VO2x queueing together.</p>
              <p>243G's queue is confirmed to be longer than 181 during the 179's
              peak period.</p>
              <p>Also seriously 241A overkill riao... Noticed a pattern of 5
              buses. 3 ADD can take e load le. Even that lone KUB 241 full trip
              is only 40% loaded.</p>
              <p>Should deploy more resources to improve 192 &amp; 193's
              headways. Ends up 192 can have 14 mins headways during AM peak
              resulting in brunching along e way.</p>

              <p>Sorry hor 3 ADD for 241A is counting for trouble. You try waiting for it around 6.30 to 6.50am i tell you 2 241A ADD come all full included upstairs. And The kub are full to the doors. You never live there so you dun anyhow say the load. I report to camp every morning and i took 241A i can see the load better then you.</p>

              <p>Hmm, i do have a differing view is that the OCs are still going to be used to supplement WAB routes, and they are still relatively new. There isn't indication that 950 is going to turn WAB anytime soon too</p>
              <p>I believe that a likely case might be TIB798P -TIB832Z be redeployed, but the lifespan is reaching soon too.<br><br>Dennis lance seems to be another viable choice.</p>

              <p><br>wat do you mean by profits? 179 full route can be packed all the way (till South Spine in the morning). Tat's 6.3km.</p>
              <p>241 is only within N9 &amp; Pioneer MRT, tat's 2km. That's why there's 241A. Seriously 2km such demand if it's in e past dun even gets any DDs.</p>
              <p>Also I've mentioned to you many times never attempt to tell ppl profits. Where's your social responsibility to get everyone to school, to work n to play?</p>
              <p>And facts will be facts. 179/ 179A contribute 20% to BNL's overall traffic volume. 20,000 out of 100,000 ppl per day. Even if I go on and add PNR station's volume of 65,000, not all goes to 241.</p>
              <p>There's 179, 255, 257, NTU-D.</p>

              <p>You do realise that 241 also need the DDs. the way you are saying is that 241 dose not need any DDs. Try living a day in Jurong west and you will know my meaning. Yes 179 is a high demand service but only cater to those Uni Student while 241 serve as a resident feeder. Alot of people went to work daily and that why DDs are needed. If you can find a way to not let resident work then i got nothing much to say about taking the DDs away. THINK about it. What about those student? 241 cater to 2 primary school and a secondary. Just that alone that can fill those buses to full. If you want to compare to 179. They had alot buses running around during morning peak and it like 2 to 3 at 1 time. Not all are full also. </p>

              <p>Empty? After which stop? I dun see empty Buses from Pioneer mrt all the way to Jurong West and back to Pioneer During morning peak period. If 241 is empty what about 179? One shot come 3 to 4 and only the first 2 are filled the last 2 are practically empty also. I can also take picture of it and show you. Please understand the stituation before you start a topic.</p>

              <p>Yes your queue may be long in bnl But at pioneer? You can't just say that 241 cannot compare to 179.... Both are high demand service but can you guarantee that? You want 241 to be single deck then you prepare to get lot of complain. Since you so smart say all dun want move in you go tell them la? 99 Upper deck only 10 person? You are kidding me. I everyday afternoon sit at bus stop and observe those student coming out of school. The bus stop was so full that when 99 came i see the top are almost 50-60% full. Your ntu student not all are release at same time. But the 3 school almost had the same timing to release student. So you want to compare load i see no difference in it.</p>

Student going back home after school and weekends church goer... you tell me which is higher? I think both are. You are just thinking about yourself and those ntu student. You can no need to care about other service passenger flow..... you think only 179 got student go home ar? Then those studying at juying and xingnam no need go home la?</p>
