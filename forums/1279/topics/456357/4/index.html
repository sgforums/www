            <div class='col-md body'><p>43's frequency is worse than a feeder's frequency especially during 1pm-4pm.<br>Worst case is on Weekdays. Once waited 45min for one to come. Most probably caused by it's <em>massive</em> split shift mess. Unlike other's, 43's split shift is done horribly. Since 4 out of it's 17 buses [ Including SBS3105M which already finished SWT 43A before 1pm ] is not WAB, the rest will just jumble up. Worst case is when one of the buses brokedown. The bus behind the bus that brokedown <em>did not speed up</em> to cover up the frequency gap. Hence many got fed up waiting. </p></div>

              <p>Luckily at least for 43, you have 76 and 135 in common from Marine Parade, 70, 76 in parallel on Paya Laber / YCK, and 109 covers many of its stops on YCK / Buangkok Green / Sengkang.</p>
              <p>Having said that 43 loading has increased a lot, especially the rush at Serangoon NEX seems to be increasing for both 43 and 70. I have spotted in the evening peak, fresh buses start from NEX on both 43 and 70, and both were DDs. The one on 70 is with the pink ad. I think it makes a full round from Shenton Way to YCK and then comes back off service and does one more trip from Serangoon to YCK.</p>
              <p>The bus that started at NEX took around 80 pax in it, and the 70 that followed within a minute, still got some 10 pax.</p>

Plus with 325 being such a slow service, many preferred 43 as a ''short cut'' to NEL and as an alternative to CBD. 88's load, from what I saw at Blk 969 bus stop at a couple of mornings, have been cut by almost 30% ever since 43A's introduction.

              <p>88's main loading is AMK Ave 5 and AMK Ave 10 from where people go to AMK Station. I haven't seen a drop in 88 loading at AMK Station at least.</p>
              <p>Also 43A is just one bus. I wonder if one bus would make such a significant difference to people's traveling habits. I feel it is more to clear the crowd of the existing bus and give alternative to passengers at Blk 953 and Toho Green with 70 coming almost packed from Seletar Hills.</p>

              <p>What is the # of DDs on 43 now? Earlier, it would be difficult

              <p>Your frequency comparison did not state the time that you iris the bus. If a comparable time is not stated then its not fair to state that it drastically improve due to BSEP.</p>
