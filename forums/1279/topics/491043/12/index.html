              <p>I was waiting for bus service 43 at YCK road towards Punggol for 15 minutes. SBS6826X (shift 1A, last trip for the day) arrived at 13:45, 7 mins behind schedule, almost full, and surprisingly, crowds of about 30-40 people rushed to board the bus even though it was only 13:45.</p>
              <p>Some pax initially wanted to board, but did not board eventually. I was one of the last in the queue, but still managed to board.

              <p>The bus was full throughout the journey, even after I alighted. The loading on this timeslot is enough to warrant DDs almost every time I take the bus at this time slot.</p>
              <p>However, when I alighted, I was shocked to find SBS6104X on 43M (shift 90A, last trip for the day) behind, with all seats occupied but still rather empty, with SBS3004X on 102 in between!</p>
              <p>If SBS3004X was the bus on 43, no pax would have been left behind, but the DD will still be full, from my observations of the number of pax left behind!</p>
              <p>Also, almost every trip of shift 90A/95P on 43M is enough to warrant DDs. But, in today's special case, it was rather empty because SBS6826X was very late.</p>

              <p>I was waiting for bus service 43 at YCK road towards Punggol for
              15 minutes. SBS6826X (shift 1A, last trip for the day) arrived at
              13:45, 7 mins behind schedule, almost full, and surprisingly,
              crowds of about 30-40 people rushed to board the bus even though it
              was only 13:45.</p>
              <p>Some pax initially wanted to board, but did not board
              eventually. I was one of the last in the queue, but still managed
              to board. The Citaro somehow managed to squeeze 45 standing pax
              (total 80 pax). When the BC closed the doors, I was trapped by the
              doors behind me, and a girl carrying her school bag in front of
              me.</p>
              <p>The bus was full throughout the journey, even after I alighted.
              The loading on this timeslot is enough to warrant DDs almost every
              time I take the bus at this time slot.</p>
              <p>However, when I alighted, I was shocked to find SBS6104X on 43M
              (shift 90A, last trip for the day) behind, with all seats occupied
              but still rather empty, with SBS3004X on 102 in between!</p>
              <p>If SBS3004X was the bus on 43, no pax would have been left
              behind, but the DD will still be full, from my observations of the
              number of pax left behind!</p>
              <p>Also, almost every trip of shift 90A/95P on 43M is enough to
              warrant DDs. But, in today's special case, it was rather empty
              because SBS6826X was very late.</p>
