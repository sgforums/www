              <p>Under this scheme, checkpoints in Transperth parlance <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/2bo7nl/what_is_a_timed_stop/">act like "timed stops"</a>:</p>
              <p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/8d/97/118d97d049f1847b2ef45878db9e8acc.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="177"></p>
              <p>"For example, I catch the bus every morning. It's supposed to pick me 
                                                                                                                  up at 7:01am but it always comes at 6:56-6:58am, because there's not 
                                                                                                                  much traffic at that time of the morning.</p>
              <p>We zoom down the road and providing nobody gets on the bus (or it 
                                                                                                                  only has to stop once or twice), the bus ends up becoming another 1 or 2
                                                                                                                   minutes earlier than it should be.</p>
              <p>Then when we get to a timed stop 5 minutes early, the bus stops and 
                                                                                                                  waits there to use up all that extra time, which means the bus should 
                                                                                                                  run on time for the next block of stops in between there and the next 
                                                                                                                  timed stop."</p>
              <p>This is practiced by TT Perth. Timed stops are published in printed timetables, so passengers know the buses will arrive at these fixed times:</p>
              <p><img src="http://hourann.com/photos/2007/transperth-timetables.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="200"></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/london-bus-quality-systems-en-route-here">BCM/GCM operators intend to adopt the same practice:</a></p>
              <p>"The driver announces over the intercom: "Ladies and gentlemen, the bus 
                                                                                                                  will be held at this stop for two minutes to regulate the service."</p>
              <p>This London scenario may soon become commonplace for bus users in Singapore."</p>
              <p>If LTA is penalizing the operator for buses arriving too early at a timed stop, then 
                                                                                          you get situations (as mentioned on Route 302 above) where the operator make
                                                                                           the de-facto "timed stop" one stop before the actual stop and wait out the excess time, so that it appears on-time to LTA when it heads to the actual checkpoint.</p>
              <p>Journey times are going to get longer. The real problem comes when bus operators plan their schedules too loosely.

              <p>Under this scheme, checkpoints in Transperth parlance <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/2bo7nl/what_is_a_timed_stop/">act like "timed stops"</a>:</p>
              <p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/8d/97/118d97d049f1847b2ef45878db9e8acc.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="177"></p>
              <p>"For example, I catch the bus every morning. It's supposed to
              pick me up at 7:01am but it always comes at 6:56-6:58am, because
              there's not much traffic at that time of the morning.</p>
              <p>We zoom down the road and providing nobody gets on the bus (or
              it only has to stop once or twice), the bus ends up becoming
              another 1 or 2 minutes earlier than it should be.</p>
              <p>Then when we get to a timed stop 5 minutes early, the bus stops
              and waits there to use up all that extra time, which means the bus
              should run on time for the next block of stops in between there and
              the next timed stop."</p>
              <p>This is practiced by TT Perth. Timed stops are published in
              printed timetables, so passengers know the buses will arrive at
              these fixed times:</p>
              <p><img src="http://hourann.com/photos/2007/transperth-timetables.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="200"></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/london-bus-quality-systems-en-route-here">BCM/GCM operators intend to adopt the same
              practice:</a></p>
              <p>"The driver announces over the intercom: "Ladies and gentlemen,
              the bus will be held at this stop for two minutes to regulate the
              service."</p>
              <p>This London scenario may soon become commonplace for bus users
              in Singapore."</p>
              <p>If LTA is penalizing the operator for buses arriving too early
              at a timed stop, then you get situations (as mentioned on Route 302
              above) where the operator make the de-facto "timed stop" one stop
              before the actual stop and wait out the excess time, so that it
              appears on-time to LTA when it heads to the actual checkpoint.</p>
              <p>Journey times are going to get longer. The real problem comes
              when bus operators plan their schedules too loosely. If for example

              <p>The consequences of:</p>
              <p>1. Road hogging: Fine by TP. Waste extra diesel and extra wear and tear on buses for consistently running on low gear. Will impact on operator profit as these extra costs will not be borne by LTA.</p>
              <p>2. Arriving early at "timed stops": Fine by LTA under BSRF. Under GCM/BCM, payment to operator may also be docked for breach of contract standards. Will impact on operator profit.</p>
              <p>3. "Holding up": "right thing" (acceptable), international practice. Driver can explain to passengers. May anger the incumbent operators for reasons above, but there is no need to work with other operators. Operator profit may increase due to reward from LTA for improved BSRF performance.</p>
              <p>and it's not hard to explain the above observations on Route 302.</p>
              <p>Printing tickets will not work under GCM/BCM.</p>
