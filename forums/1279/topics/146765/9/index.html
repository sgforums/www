SBS have introduced some best services awards more than 10 years ago. awarding some services best services of the month. And these services got to display a side plate (which is gold in colour i think), indicating it is best service of the month. That why there is two side desto plate....

Between Pasir Ris interchange and Eunos interchange. In 1997, merged with service M4 and extended to Marine Parade. Used to ply Marine Cres in both directions and Marine Terrace towards Pasir Ris, sectors deleted later. --&gt; i believe this service only plied marine crescent for both directions only, never did ply marine terrace for return trip to pasir ris.<br><br>Service 18: Loop service between Tampines interchange and Bedok interchange. No route change.  --&gt; service 18 was originally a Bedok - Tampines St 22 loop service. service was extended to tampines interchange via ave 2, ave 7, central 3 and central 1 when it was opened, skipping tampines st 22 totally, and amended to become a tampines interchange to bedok interchange loop service.<br><br>Service 62: Between Hougang South interchange and Rumah Tinggi terminal, shortened to New Bridge Rd terminal in 1993. On Sunday 07 Dec 2003, amended to ply as a loop service between Punggol temporary interchange and Lor 1 Geylang, under NEL rationalisation phase 3.  --&gt; service 62 was amended  to hougang south interchange due to the abolishment of macpherson terminal in 1992 i think, skipping macpherson estate totally. svc 63 was then introduced to cover the lost link.<br><br>Service 290: Feeder service between Tampines interchange and Simei St 3.
