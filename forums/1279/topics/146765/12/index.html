THere are no SBST or TL Guides in the 80s.<br><br>Earlier post, u mentioned that they are JIS operated by SBST , which did not appear in TL guides. Then another post, u mentioned that it was withdrawn in 1986. If it is withdrawn in 1986, it will never appear on TL guides then.. It is very confusing with your contradicting posts...</div>
