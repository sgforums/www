This is a tall order! I'd suggest you get a copy of Mr. Mike Davis' new book. The answers are all inside; a real treasure trove.<br><br>OK, which one do you want to start first? How about the Albion Viking? This was the first major order of new buses by SBS. They were of the EVK55 type, which was an improvement over the earlier EVK41 type, with dual air braking system. 255 buses were ordered altogether, 155 of which were EVK55CL (9813mm length) and the rest being the longer EVK55CUL (11790mm length).<br>All were bodied by Soon Chow with ribbed side panels. Seating capacities varied but in general, the EVK55CL could carry 41 while the EVK55CUL 55 passengers.<br><br>Both variants were powered by a Leyland O.401, 6075cc diesel engine with manual clutch and 4-speed constant mesh gearbox. (The Albion Viking didn't have crash gearboxes as I previously thought). The Vikings were introduced from 1975 - 1977 and were fully withdrawn by 1992.<br><br></div>

The one to its left was the British Aluminium Company (BACo) body. It workings were not confined to 140 as they had been deployed on other services as well such as 133, 132 and 159 to name few. Their 5XXX registration suggests that they were based at Ang Mo Kio Depot.<br><br>The first Atlanteans had a SCG 350 epicyclic gearbox with fully automatic control.
