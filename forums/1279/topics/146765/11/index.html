You sure had a good memory...<br><br>Care to share about Tampines bus history?</div></blockquote>At the point in time when i had moved to tampines in 1984, the estate was only developed at around part of street 11, part of street 12, part of street 21 &amp; part of street 22.<br><br>I remembered that Tampines ave 1 (the stretch along present Temasek Poly) was mostly used as a side parking space for heavy vehicles and the stretch was dark and dimly lighted.<br><br>Tampines ave 2 only ended at the present junction of Tampines Street 21, right outside ChongZheng Pri Sch. All vehicles were to U-turn there, including the bus services plying there.<br><br>Original bus service plying there were svc 18 and svc 292.<br><br>Svc 18 Bedok - Tampines Ave 2 (Loop)<br>Bedok Interchange, North St 1, North Ave 3, Bedok Reservoir Rd, Tampines Ave 1, Ave 2, u-turn at junction of St 21, continue along Ave 2, Ave 1, Bedok Reservoir Rd, Bedok North Ave 3, North St 1 and Bedok Interchange<br><br>Svc 292 Tampines - Tampines Ave 2 (Loop)<br>Tampines Terminal, Ave 5, Ave 2, u-turn at junction St 21, continue along Ave 2, Ave 5 and Tampines Terminal<br><br>When street 22 was fully opened, and the u-turn junction was abolished, and svc 18 and svc 292 looped at street 22.<br><br>The the bus terminal at that time was along tampines avenue 5, right outside the present blk 938. Original services that plied there were:<br><br>Svc 10 Tampines - Jurong (from Somapah Terminal)<br>Svc 23 Tampines - Tomlinson Rd (Loop) (new svc)<br>Svc 28 Tampines - New Bridge Rd (new svc)<br>Svc 292 Tampines - Tampines St 22 (Loop) (new svc)<br><br>When the estate was further developed, more services were amended or introduced, such as:<br><br>Svc 29 Tampines - Changi Airport Cargo Complex (Loop) (new svc)<br>Svc 31 Tampines - Kallang Park (Loop) (extended from Bedok Interchange)<br>Svc 65 Tampines - World Trade Centre (extended from MacPherson Terminal)<br>Svc 293 Tampines - Tampines St 81 (Loop) (new svc)<br>Svc 294 Tampines - Tampines St 21 (Loop) (new svc)<br><br>When the new Tampines Interchange was opened, all services were re-located there, including service 18. Previously, the interchange had no buildings around it, so it was like a building in the middle of a vast plot of empty undeveloped land, kinda look a little weird. (Yes, there were no Pavilion, no MRT, no Century Sq, no Tampines Mall, no DBS Building and others.)<br><br>SBS had opened only one side of the interchange actually, which is from berths A1 - A10 and berths B7 - B10. (refer to http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/busint_tampines.asp) The other side was actually unopened. I also remembered that svcs 10, 23 and 28 occupied berths A1 - A10 while the rest of the services occupied the remaining berths.<br><br>That is as far as i can recall my memory.</div>

Have been a Sembawangite the first 10 years of my life and an Yishunite thereafter and still is.<br><br>Yes, TIB279X and TIB280R are the first AC buses TIBS had. BUT (as some other thread stated)..... the first AC or PAC service was NOT 850, or 852.... rather, it was .... *drum-roll* 167!!!!!!<br><br>Yep, 167... then both AC buses (279X and 280R) went from 167 (rather quickly) to 850... and then (also rather quickly) to 852, where it stayed for a while before being given to the old service 950.<br><br>TIB311K to TIB317U were *NOT* AC buses from the outstart. They were in the same batch of NAC buses (WITHOUT the AC unit and ceiling blow ducts) that included TIB311K to TIB319P, which initially served on service 167 when first procured. TIB311K to TIB317U were only retrofitted with rooftop AC units sometime around when service 951 was introduced (due to shortage of AC buses). TIB320J to TIB336P were pressed into service shortly after TIB311K to TIB319P were bought.<br><br>WRT to R87 or U31SCN, frankly I dont know the diff between the two in terms of engine or chassis - all nissan sliding-door-exit buses (TIB251A to TIB336P, as well as the U31RCNs) all have the same engine cap (11670cc) and almost similar engine noises anyway. Any slight differences in engine noises are probably due to slightly different versions of automatic ZF gearboxes (all ZF's except likely Voith's in TIB335S and TIB336P).<br><br>And one very big potential discepancy - TIB311K to TIB317U, as well as TIB390G - likely never served on service 852 (at least as AC buses). Those buses had been at KJDEP as well as service 852 alright, but 852 had become a full NAC service (after TIB279X and TIB280R had been given to 950) by the time TIB390G were bought and TIB311K to TIB317U acquired their AC unit. And by the time 852 attained PAC and FAC status, TIB311K to TIB317U had either been retired from service or converted back to be used as NAC buses. TIB390G went on to SSB as well by then. Service 852 was one of the very last NAC service to be given PAC status (after TIB279X and TIB280R left).</div></blockquote>Continue from the Service 852 thread......<br><br>Thanks for the clarification about the various points.<br><br>I am surprised that TIB311 to TIB318 were first NAC buses, then converted to AC Buses.<br><br>Do you have any idea when the conversion from NAC to AC took place?  Somewhere around 1990 or 1991?  I don't have the date for the introduction of Service 951<br><br>As for the R87, I am also not sure what are the differences in Chassis, but I have seen differences between the bodywork.

I first saw a retrofitted U31 on 951 (which was TIB313E). Much to my dismay coz those buses were premium buses of AMKDEP at that time. I believe some other forumnites here have the exact dates.<br><br>I dont think the headlight cover colours are reliable indicators between R87 and U31SCN's. TIB271S, TIB282K, TIB286A, TIB287Y had silver covers, while TIB288U, TIB301P, TIB308X had black ones, for example. Sometimes the memory are a little blurred coz some buses may have changed from silver to black covers (replacement) e.g. TIB271S after faceplate reconstruction after an accident. Even the older U31F's had inconsistent headlight cover colours, some black, some white. TIB336P underwent faceplate reconstruction too - it too had an accident that ripped off the whole front. When I saw it in AMKDEP during repairs, it had *BLACK* square headlight covers, but when it came out on the road subsequently, the black turned to *SILVER*! So I suspect the black colour could actually be some protective layer that is supposed to be peeled off after installation of the cover.</div>
