            <div class='col-md body'>Info i found about the Hock Lee Bus Riots, my 1st useful contribution, i hope it may be useful. Taken from MOE.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: brown;">The Hock Lee Bus Riots (12 May 1955)</span></strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span><br><br>Singaporeans have enjoyed many years of political and social stability. It is thus easy to take this stability for granted. Life for Singaporeans was however not always that peaceful in the 1950s. An unfortunately violent episode was the Hock Lee Bus Riots, a bloody chapter in SingaporeÂ’s history which resulted in the death of four people and the injury of another 31.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE RIOTS</span><br><br>The poor working conditions of the bus workers was the most basic factor. They worked long hours at low pay for bus companies which were often poorly managed. As a result, many joined unions in the hope that these workersÂ’ unions could help them obtain better working conditions and higher pay. Their dissatisfaction provided politicians opportunities to foster social instability for their own ends.<br><br>Pro-communist politicians were most interested in fostering unrest and violence. By doing so, they hoped that the British authorities and the anti-communist local government led by David Marshall would be discredited, thus giving them opportunities to seize power. These pro-communist politicians formed a faction within the PeopleÂ’s Action Party, which in 1955 was an opposition party. Two young and charismatic communist-inspired instigators were Fong Swee Suan and Lim Chin Siong. The latter controlled sixteen unions and was seen as the official representative of the workers by the masses and the Chinese press. The objectives of the pro-communist politicians were clear from the speech made by Fong Swee Suan, who controlled the bus workers union, during the May Day rally in 1955: "All workers must unite and should not hesitate to organise themselves into trade unions to struggle for their own welfare. Workers must know that there is bound to be some bloodshed in the course of a revolution and they must rise and unite."<br><br>The temptation to test the mettle of the government was also strong. Singapore had just held a Legislative Assembly Election in Apr 1955 and the Labour Front led by David Marshall formed the minority government by a narrow margin. Since the government did not get a strong mandate from the people in an election which only 51.4% of the voters bothered to vote, the pro-communists decided to embark on a militant confrontation, with the student and labour movements in the forefront of attempts to foster violence.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE STRIKES AND RIOTS</span><br><br>The Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company was one of several small bus companies operating in Singapore in the 50s. The bus workers of Hock Lee belonged to two unions, the Singapore Bus WorkersÂ’ Union, controlled by Fong Swee Suan, and the Hock Lee EmployeesÂ’ Union, which was backed and endorsed by the Hock Lee Management. The Hock Lee Management successfully resisted attempts by FongÂ’s union to take over the pro-management union much to FongÂ’s ire. Fong decided to mobilise workers under his control.<br><br>The opportunity to foster social unrest came when some Hock Lee Bus workers belonging to FongÂ’s union started a strike for better pay and working conditions. Although a settlement seemed likely at one stage, the pro-communists in the union were not interested in this. They were more interested in exploiting the dispute to whip up the emotions of the workers and to have a confrontation with the government. On 23 Apr 1955, Fong declared an official strike of Hock Lee workers, urging all bus companies to stage a sympathy strike if the dispute was not settled. The dispute escalated when the Hock Lee Bus Company retaliated by dismissing 229 workers belonging to FongÂ’s Union. Strikers went on hunger strike and picketed the depot, supported by students from the Chinese Middle Schools who provided song-and-dance for their entertainment. The Bus Company refused to be intimidated and managed to put 40 out of 70 buses on the road. The stage was set for an imminent showdown.<br><br>On 27 Apr, the police tried to break up the strikers, resulting in 15 of them being injured. This gained more support for the strikers from workers and students. Following police advice, the company decided not to operate their buses. On 30 April, the bus company offered to reinstate the sacked workers even before the Court of Inquiry, ordered by the Ministry of Labour to look into the matter, came to a decision.<br><br>The issue, however, remained unresolved. Sympathy strikes by other workers were held and there were threats of a general strike. The attempt by the Court of Inquiry to defuse the situation by ruling that two-thirds of the Bus WorkersÂ’ Union and one-third of the Hock Lee EmployeesÂ’ Union should run on separate routes with full reinstatement of dismissed workers enjoyed short-lived success. The dispute with management flared up again over trivial issues and picketing resumed at the bus depot. On 8 May, the police riot squad was brought in to disperse the picket. On 11 May, FongÂ’s Bus WorkersÂ’ Union declared a two-day strike in protest against the use of force. With that declaration, all bus services in Singapore would come to a standstill.<br><br>The government decided that decisive action had to be taken. On 12 May , the police moved in to break up the pickets. Jets of water from fire hoses were used by the police while the pickets retaliated by throwing stones and bottles. By the afternoon, "reinforcements" in the form of students had arrived and the battle raged on with tear gas, bottles, cangkuls and stones into the early hours of the following morning.<br><br>One student, Chong Loon Chuan, was shot and wounded in the lung, one mile away from the nearest hospital. Instead of sending him there to receive medical treatment, pro-Communist students made a martyr out of him, parading him around for two and a half hours to further inflame the emotions of the mob. By the time he was sent to the hospital, he was already dead. A policeman, Detective Corporal Yuen Yan Peng also had his car set on fire by the rioters and died as a result. A journalist, Gene D. Symonds, was set upon by the mob and received fatal head injuries. A fourth man, Volunteer Special Constable Andrew Teoh Bok Lan, was critically injured by the mob, and died in hospital soon after. The police managed to overcome the resistance by the dawn of the next day, but not before four people had been killed, and thirty one injured.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSION</span><br><br>The Hock Lee Bus Riots was the most serious and bloody of the 275 strikes in 1955. The social unrest was to everybodyÂ’s loss. Economically, 946 354 man-days were lost at a time when poverty and unemployment were rampant. The studies of many Chinese school students were badly disrupted when they were provoked by Communist-inspired leaders into lending support to workers involved in industrial disputes. For the individual, serious social turmoil meant a reduced sense of personal security. The Riots is an important reminder that social stability is crucial to our continued growth and success.<br><br>The above article was prepared by the National Education Branch (MOE).</div>
