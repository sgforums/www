            <div class='col-md body'>I also missed Volvo B57, MB OF1413 &amp; MB OF1417. I always took Svc 343 from Bt Panjang before taking over by Tibs. When Svc 343 was taken over by Tibs, the buses used by SBS were gone and some were still on service until they reached the end of the statutory life-span.<br><br>I knew the Volvo B57 were shipped to Ireland, and retired there in Sep 2004.<br><br>I also saw an LA plied on Svc 865 before in 1999. (SBS5604B)<br><br>Anyway, the 2 NAC buses plied on NR1 in 2000 (Hino HT238K), were charged the same flat rate of $3. The front desto is blank but they placed the NR1 plate on the front windscreen. Rare chance to see 2 NAC buses plying on NightRider Services.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
