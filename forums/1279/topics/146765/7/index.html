Aircon 118 got them later but it was unsure whether the UD's were former Aircon 3 buses. The CAC Guy Victories made their appearance on Aircon 3 during that period; not forgetting also the Van Hool B10M and Renault PR100.2. Since Aircon 168 had ceased operations by this time, I believe the Mercedes buses were used on Aircon 118 as well.</div>
