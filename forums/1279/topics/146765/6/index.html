I think you are confused with the current 28. 28 was reintroduced (Tampines to Bedok loop service ) . Later on , She took over 152's Bedok-Toa Payoh sector to become Tampines to Toa Payoh route.<br><br>My question earlier was regarding the old service 28 not the current one. Hope this clears up the confusion.</div>
