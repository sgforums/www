              <p>Your constant annoyance to everyone in this forum puts me off and I am gonna talk to you ONCE in the tone you would understand, although I doubt anything constructive would come out of this due to your puerile mindset. It is paramount i knock some stinking sense into your idiotic brain. Constantly editing sgwiki without proper evidential proof, btw I was the one who banned you for a day in sgwiki. And I'm here because I am fed up with rolling back your edits of deployments that are false. Good there's a 3107H who helps to clean up your disgusting mess. You constantly shoot off your mouth thinking like you know everything. U know peanuts let me tell you. I hate idiots like u and I hope u can go as far as the sun sets and wake your bloody idea up. Your parents probably didn't teach you huh is a great pity. </p>
              <p>U scold at every mistake people make what any how whack any how whack. U the one who keep any how whack this spare that perm keep cleaning your shit up. and when ppl feel they are right over what u said and what u said is wrong, just keep quiet or say ok or fight back damn insecurely over trivial shit that you were wrong about. Keep shooting of your mouth, unwanted comments like bitch and nonsense when brbp takes certain buses, like u can change anything with it and like as if amdep takes it makes a tad of a difference. My bsep edits on sgwiki u just blatantly copy and paste it here without my consent. You need to relook at the shit impression u give others. And Singapore buses is run by my friends and I stop taking photos from there and using them for shit, you want take your own photos which probably cmi. And the forum members can access the photos on their own. </p>

              <p>Some may choose to post, some may not, and for this I dun think we can blame you for it.</p>
              <p>However, I dun think you should criticise other people's mistakes here. You make mistakes, and we too, I'm definitely not the exception. However, we should learn to have a postive attitude. Instead of criticising, teaching is a far better method. Try to learn how to empathise with other people's feelings and one will definitely feel bad when he tried contributing to the forums but in the end regarded as having whacked here.</p>
              <p>Be patient, be polite. Every forum users prefer users who are friendly, willing to teach one another, and have fun in the forums. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              Instead of criticising, teaching is a far better method. Try to
              learn how to empathise with other people's feelings and one will
              definitely feel bad when he tried contributing to the forums but in
              the end regarded as having whacked here.</p>

              <p>Your constant annoyance to everyone in this forum puts me off
                          and I am gonna talk to you ONCE in the tone you would understand,
                          although I doubt anything constructive would come out of this due
                          to your puerile mindset. It is paramount i knock some stinking
                          sense into your idiotic brain. Constantly editing sgwiki without
                          proper evidential proof, btw I was the one who banned you for a day
                          in sgwiki. And I'm here because I am fed up with rolling back your
                          edits of deployments that are false. Good there's a 3107H who helps
                          to clean up your disgusting mess. You constantly shoot off your
                          mouth thinking like you know everything. U know peanuts let me tell
                          you. I hate idiots like u and I hope u can go as far as the sun
                          sets and wake your bloody idea up. Your parents probably didn't
                          teach you huh is a great pity. </p>
              <p>U scold at every mistake people make what any how whack any how
                          whack. U the one who keep any how whack this spare that perm keep
                          cleaning your shit up. and when ppl feel they are right over what u
                          said and what u said is wrong, just keep quiet or say ok or fight
                          back damn insecurely over trivial shit that you were wrong about.
                          Keep shooting of your mouth, unwanted comments like bitch and
                          nonsense when brbp takes certain buses, like u can change anything
                          with it and like as if amdep takes it makes a tad of a difference.
                          My bsep edits on sgwiki u just blatantly copy and paste it here
                          without my consent. You need to relook at the shit impression u
                          give others. And Singapore buses is run by my friends and I stop
                          taking photos from there and using them for shit, you want take
                          your own photos which probably cmi. And the forum members can
                          access the photos on their own. </p>
              <p><span>U can ask others about me, I can give u hell if u
                          want hell from me. Please shut up and speak with some level of tact
