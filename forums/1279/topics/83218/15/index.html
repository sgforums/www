            <div class='col-md body'>Watz ur PROBLEM sbst275?<br><br>Is it psychological or what?<br><br>You seem have some obsession over service 8 and it's double-deck fleet?  Not only this, you seem to have some COMPULSIVE obsession over the status of those PAC services...tell us...what's your problem?<br><br>Because you know why...it's very irritating to see you ranting perpetually over Service 8 and the status of those PAC...What would stop you from posting these things again?  When service 8 receives all single decks or better still withdrawn?  How abt putting VSO and Tridents or MK 4 DM 3500 on those PAC service so they become FAC?<br><br>If that does not satisfy you, what then?  I suggest you seek therapy or see a shrink...because such obsession is unhealthy...<br><br>Or why dun u see if u can do better...go apply at Comfort Delgro...<br><br>Lastly, if you do not know...you are regarded a leper, an outcast of this forums...do you know you are very unpopular and irritating?  You make this place very unhappy...do you know that?  If you insist on doing so please leave this place.  This place is not for you.  If you have any shame in you, please stop doing irritating things.<br><br>By the way, after this post, i am totally going to ignore whatever sbst275 writes...i implore you all to do the same.  Don't bother with that he writes...because it's a waste of your time and they r crap.  Don't respond or retort him.  Let him know his comments are NOT wanted.</div>

It is the love for SG buses that brought us together.<br><br>It's either we buy ideas or not... if we dun wanna suscribe, then just dun reply... there is no need to make a point.<br><br>To SBST275, it does get a bit irritating if one continuously harp on a certain subject. there is no wrong championing a particular point but perhaps know where to stop is the key...

            <div class='col-md body'>Some interesting finds from my check at SBST E guide again<br><br>Most svs have their frequency adjusted: 2, 3, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26, 36, 39, 40, 42, 53, 55, 62, 69, 70, 72, 74, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 93, 96, 100, 103, 107, 123, 130, 132, 136, 157, 158, 502. But only 93 have their frequency better. Others had its worst, night frequency is now between 12-17 mins. AM off peak frequency is now between 8-15 mins<br><br>Another thing, 93 departs at 0520 (Weekdays and Sat) from HarbourFront instead of 0550. Buses from Enous will leave at 0550 instead of 0600</div>
