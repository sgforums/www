            <div class='col-md body'>I posted the article here, because this article will be removed very soon, like The Straits Time<br><br><span class="large">ZF gearbox: savings for SBS?<br>Vendor says HK customer that used its Ecomat saw fuel bill shaved by 8%</span><br><br>GERMAN automotive supplier ZF Group could possibly save SBS Transit as much as 8 per cent of its fuel bill or $6 million if the bus company switches over to using ZF's new six-speed auto gearbox for its entire fleet.<br><br>Earlier this year, SBS Transit placed a $70 million order for 150 new Volvo double-decker buses, of which 100 will use the ZF Ecomat six-speed automatic transmission. This new gearbox is said to reduce fuel consumption by 5-8 per cent over the previous four-speed auto transmission.<br><br>Running costs are also lower because of savings derived from longer maintenance intervals, said FX Laubscher, president of ZF South-east Asia. 'There are massive fuel savings because the engine runs at a lower speed due to the closer gear and axle ratios,' said Mr Laubscher, adding that there is no change in price for the improved transmission.<br><br>He said that when used in a Hongkong public bus fleet, the Ecomat six-speed delivered fuel savings of 8 per cent. On the other hand, independent tests performed in Rome came up with an average of 5.5 per cent.<br><br>SBS Transit has been facing rising fuel costs in recent years, and this was one of the reasons the public transport operator gave for justifying its fare hike last month.<br><br>Last year, the listed company's diesel bill came to $55 million, or 10.5 per cent of 2004's total operating expenses. SBS Transit said the amount was $16 million higher than two years earlier.<br><br>In May, the company said its first-quarter 2005 fuel costs had risen more than 40 per cent compared to the same period in 2004 because of surging world oil prices. Given that the average price of oil was about $10 less per barrel then, it can be assumed that the bus operator will have a fuel bill of at least $77 million this year. A 5-8 per cent gain in fuel economy would then mean savings of $3.9 million to $6.2 million if all its 2,700 diesel-engined buses get the new concept transmission.<br><br>The new-generation bus with the ZF six-speeder has been available in Europe for about a year now and ZF said the transmission also results in lower exhaust and noise emissions because the engine is working more optimally.<br></div>
