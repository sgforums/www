              <p>Hmmm i have not seen anywhere that said SMRT claimed that TIB605M brakes are working at the time of the accident. They said it was last checked in June 2013 and at THAT date it was working fine. So we may not know if this time the brakes are working or not. However do note that the driver also mentioned that his accelerator was jammed of some sorts, losing control of it. At 50-60km/h with max engine power and down slope, i believe the brakes will eventually burn itself out (aka brake fade).</p>
              <p>Edit: I myself have experience accelerator jamming on a MKIV Strider. <span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show">Was on 66 and the
               BC kept kicking down everytime the bus moves off. Somewhere along Bukit

              <p><strong>Hmmm i have not seen anywhere that said SMRT claimed that
              TIB605M brakes are working at the time of the accident. They said
              it was last checked in June 2013 and at THAT date it was working
              fine.</strong> So we may not know if this time the brakes are working or
              not. However do note that the driver also mentioned that his
              accelerator was jammed of some sorts, losing control of it. At
              50-60km/h with max engine power and down slope, i believe the
              brakes will eventually burn itself out (aka brake fade).</p>

              <p>So do u think smrt will publicly admit that there is brake fault
              ? Of course no right? They now must say the bus is ok.  Then
              when there is the coroner hearing then we will see the real reason.

              <p>in the army, you know what the driving instructor taught us? if accelerator fail, brakes fail,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you pull the handbrakes. if the driver indeed stick to this basic protocol, and at the speed the bus going even if the brakes or accelerator fail, the handbrake if indeed used gensuinely would be damaged.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all these evidence can be found after the accident atthe site scene invesitagtion or tow back to garage for overhaul /inspection review.</p>
              <p>if the damages are assessed not to the depth of engine and at the brake mechanism line assembly level, and if the brakes found internally dmaged not due to impact but rather wear at force speed angagement, then the driver probably telling the truth.</p>
