              <p>Luck plays apart too... Hmm... You can't say it like that because if the bus was tested alright the day before by mechanics, the next day happened like this, it might not be the mechanic or driver fault, or rather there can be cases whereby its the bus'es part that gone wrong since its been aging...

              eh...
              
              got slow down prior to the bus being at the downslope?
              
              what was bus's travelling speed before the brakes so called malfunctioned?
              
              Now... Today's ST reported that BC claimed he braked to halt.. but realised brake didn't work... or not working...
              
              ok... so he waited nearly until at downslope, towards the end to brake???
              
              Dun say I allege... I ever took rides on 960, 966... On both Dairy Farm and Bt Panjang exit.. some SMRT BC the way they whack the accelerator even on downslope [latter is so narrow, so sharp pointed bend at the end] is like akin to waiting for accident to occur.

              <p>"From the video shown, the SMRT bus had been going at a speed of at least 100km/h from BKE Exit 2, all the way down till it hit the kerb, lost control, skidded into the other lane. and crashed.</p>
              <p>At least 100km/h? I think Stomper is over exaggerating, but still the bus is speeding nonetheless.</p>

              <p>I believe is human error, however not reckless driving. Probably the driver accidentally stepped on the accelerator, causing the bus to "not slow down but speed up" as reported by Zaobao. Thinking it was the brakes the BC took the judgement that the brakes have failed, thus "spamming the "brakes" four times", causing it to go even faster. By then, it became almost impossible to steer the bus, and as a result the bus crossed lanes and over it went. </p>

              <p>If this is true it just shows how impoverished SMRT's bus
              maintenance is. Look, now it's faulty parts claimed an innocent

              <p>there are already cases of brake failure.. it is possible.... go google..  further it is down slope.. travelling at 60km entering the slope and with brake fail, the bus will just go faster and faster.......if u have study science....... even if the bus is stationary at the entrance to the slope and without any brake, the bus will just travel down the slope faster and faster...</p>
              <p>anyway, there is this train accident in canada recently as well... Train park on top of slope with brake engaged. engine is NOT ON, and seem like brake having issue and train speed down the slope at high speed and crashed..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>and there are still many people who feel so happy when SMRT BCs speed on expressway... saying that the 858/965/969 buses that they take can overtake 39/161/168 buses easily,.....</p>
