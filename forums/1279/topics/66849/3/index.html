What's more the students travelling to Kent Ridge from the East need not have to travel to Clementi to make transfer, they need only to alight at Dover which was one stop earlier. BV though was 2 stops away from Kent Ridge and was served by 95, was not really popular for those study in Engineering faculty (near Kent Ridge Interchange), as the journey was pretty long as compared from Dover to Kent Ridge or Clementi to Kent Ridge.<br><br>d. NUS provides Free Shuttle Service between University Cultural Centre between Dover and Kent Ridge when there are performances, only reflects the more direct connection it has had over Clementi MRT and Kent Ridge.<br><br>e.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iamgoondu:</div><div class="quote_body">The reasons were pretty obvious:<br><br>a. The link between Dover MRT and Kent Ridge Int is more direct and than that between Kent Ridge and BV or Clementi.<br><br>b. Moreover, there are fewer jams between Dover MRT and Clementi Road than Clementi MRT to Clementi Road.<br><br>c. What's more the students travelling to Kent Ridge from the East need not have to travel to Clementi to make transfer, they need only to alight at Dover which was one stop earlier. BV though was 2 stops away from Kent Ridge and was served by 95, was not really popular for those study in Engineering faculty (near Kent Ridge Interchange), as the journey was pretty long as compared from Dover to Kent Ridge or Clementi to Kent Ridge.<br><br>d. NUS provides Free Shuttle Service between University Cultural Centre between Dover and Kent Ridge when there are performances, only reflects the more direct connection it has had over Clementi MRT and Kent Ridge.<br><br>e. A link between Dover and Kent Ridge would benefit students, though it might not be likewise for SBST. Since SBST had monopoly over 95 and 96. I would rather prefer TIBS to take up the challenge.<br><br>How do you think?<br><br></div></blockquote>i believe your argument is a solid one, however, Services 95 and 96 are already serving the area and the pax load of Svc 95 has not really been maxed out to have SBST consider another trunk service into NUS/NUH.. try asking for a day service from Kent Ridge Terminal to Commonwealth Ave West Dover MRT (Loop).. this would make your idea more susceptible to SBST..<br><br>the route most likely would be: Kent Ridge Terminal, (Clementi Rd), Kent Ridge Cres, Clementi Rd, Commonwealth Ave West, Dover Ave, Dover Rd, Clementi Rd, Kent Ridge Cres, (Clementi Rd) and Kent Ridge Terminal.<br><br>wat should we call the service? 90-99 are used.. haha..</div>

SBS Transit has its reason for keeping some bus services PAC and mainly it's because of either seasonal demands (e.g. 354) or high frequency (which requires a huge fleet of buses such that there are insufficient AC buses to cover the entire fleet).</div>
