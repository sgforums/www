            <div class='col-md body'>I had wrote in many, but only one (or two) got implemented.<br><br>a. A direct connection between Holland Ave and Commonwealth MRT. (TIBS 5 was withdrawn then due to start up of BPLRT)<br><br>Fortunately, TIBS implemented TIBS 970. Probably it had received far too many complaints regarding its withdrawal.<br><br>b. Written for a more direct link between BV MRTand NUS. (SBST 95 terminate at NUH then). Now SBST 95 has been extended to NUS.<br><br>Here are some  that were not get implemented:<br>a. To have SBST 145 and SBST 32 loop at Holland Ave, Holland Road, North Buona Vista Road and Commonwealth Ave West, rather than terminating at BV Terminal.<br><br>The looping enables BV residents more services to link to MRT stations.<br><br>b. To have a direct link between Dover MRT to Kent Ridge via Commonwealth Ave West, Clementi Road, University Highway and Kent Ridge. I had proposed for extending SBST 145, 32, 111 or 100 to be extended to Kent Ridge.<br><br>c. Science Park 2 (not 1) and BV MRT can be better linked. SBST 200 is only 4 bus stops away. However many are not aware and thus SBST 200 was not popular. See the crowd at Clementi Interchange boarding for Science Park 2 Shuttle Bus service, SBST 200 does not warrant such fate.<br><br>Science Park 2 can be better linked if there is a slip road linking itself to South Buona Vista Road.<br><br>d. I had requested for TIBS 61 or TIBS 75 to amend to ply between Clementi Road and Dover MRT along Commonwealth Ave West.<br><br>Currently SBST had monopoly  with SBST 74 plying between Clementi Road and Dover MRT.<br><br>e. Many years back when SBST 200 loop at Sixth Ave, I had proposed for its extension to Dunearn Road to NTU/NIE. That shall allow many students along Dunearn Road to have more direct link to BV MRT  stations. This amendment allows BV residents to have a more direct link to Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road. Imagine spending $1.13 to travel to Chinese High from Holland Drive with SBST 74. Unfortunately it was not considered.<br><br>f. I had complaints for cutbact=k of TIBS 106 to suntec. And had proposed for it to loop at Sungei Road (Near Sim Lim Square) instead. My argument why have an amended route that ply exactly with existing TIBS 77???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PTC or LTA that forced TIBS to cut back  to Suntec? Abit mixed up with their roles. Thought all routes amendments and fare adjustments were under PTC.<br><br>Anyway I feel sorry to TIBS. now TIBS 106 run at very low capacity at certain timings.<br><br>I feel that a bus service should ply between 2 housing estates via City or Orchard or Raffles Place. With that, the bus load would be very much average.<br><br>Not sure about the history of SBST145..., I will not take SBST 145 to ChinaTown and beyond from Commonwealth Ave. The journey was exceptionally  long, from Commowealth Ave, to Redhill, Henderson Road, World Trade Center, Keppel Road, Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown... I was not surprised if it did terminate at Kent Ridge earlier.</div>

I think it was amended to Buona Vista in late 1980s, perhap with the integration of another service?<br></div>
