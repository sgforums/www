            <div class='col-md body'>iamgoondu and also those concerned:<br><br>This is the feedback from SBS Transit CRC concerning the introduction of a bus service between Kent Ridge, NUS and Dover station.<br><br><blockquote><br>Our Ref      : 2004/Jan/1205<br>Toll-free:  1800-2872727<br>Mainline:   6284-8866<br>Fax:        6282-5204<br>Website:    www.sbstransit.com.sg<br><br>04/02/2004<br><br>To Whom It May Concern<br><br>Dear Sir or Madam<br><br>We refer to your feedback we received on 26 January.<br><br>2     As per investigation by the planners, the stop along Dover Station<br>does not have adequate facilities for effective bus operations.  With a<br>service calling at Dover, some passengers would be expected to shift from<br>Clementi and as a result, queues would be formed during the peak periods,<br>this in turn would be potentially disruptive to the traffic flow as the<br>stop serves Singapore Polytechnic as well as passengers transferring<br>to/from the MRT from/to other bus services.<br><br>3     Due to the above constraint, we regret that we are unable to adhere<br>to your suggestion.  Nevertheless, we have kept your suggestion for our<br>future planning.<br><br>4     Thank you for your feedback.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>[name withheld]<br>Corporate Communications<br>SBS Transit Ltd<br></blockquote>I have replied explaining that they can make use of Dover station for such higher loading and unloading needs as there are split dividers at the pair of bus stops outside Dover station (not just one, but both bus stops have it) so the buses from current services calling there can depart first without their operation being disrupted and cited the case of Sentosa Service C buses using split divider bus stop at Tiong Bahru MRT where the Sentosa buses park in the front part of the bus bay and other omnibuses can depart from behind with the split divider..<br><br>I have also asked them to look into converting the underutilised taxi stands into an extension of the bus stop as a means of providing space for large volume of passenger boarding and alighting facilities..<br><br>Now let's wait for their reply..</div>
