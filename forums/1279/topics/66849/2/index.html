Many years back when SBST 200 loop at Sixth Ave, I had proposed for its extension to Dunearn Road to NTU/NIE. That shall allow many students along Dunearn Road to have more direct link to BV MRT  stations. This amendment allows BV residents to have a more direct link to Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road. Imagine spending $1.13 to travel to Chinese High from Holland Drive with SBST 74. Unfortunately it was not considered.<br><br></div></blockquote>a. You can ask SBST to amend service 33 to serve Dover MRT station.<br><br>b. The unpopularity of service 200 is due to the frequency. The service does serve Science Park 2 along South Buona Vista Rd.

TIBS965 resembles my idea totally. i wanted a nice bus link from sengkang to Khatib MRT and there u go.<br><br>SBS161 was also implemented but guess it was just to compete with 965<br><br>SERVICE 963<br>well i complained about express 521 and wanted 189 to extned to HBF thru NUS so i cd take bus from NUS to HBF rat hole back then. thne suddenyl next month the 521 goes and 963 comes...lolz<br><br>SERVICE 180 extension to sembawng pending.....<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

I remembered taking Service 90 from Commonwealth Ave to Jalan Bukit Merah in the early 80's. (If I can remembered correctly.) The service was probably withdrawn/integrated when the E-W line starts running. It was one of the many buses like 209, 186, 144, 148, 2, 103... that were withdrawn, amended or integrated.<br><br>Your Service 90 that was introduced in 1993 was probably a recycled number as well, just like 92.</div>

The link between Dover MRT and Kent Ridge Int is more direct and than that between Kent Ridge and BV or Clementi.<br><br>b. Moreover, there are fewer jams between Dover MRT and Clementi Road than Clementi MRT to Clementi Road.<br><br>c. What's more the students travelling to Kent Ridge from the East need not have to travel to Clementi to make transfer, they need only to alight at Dover which was one stop earlier. BV though was 2 stops away from Kent Ridge and was served by 95, was not really popular for those study in Engineering faculty (near Kent Ridge Interchange), as the journey was pretty long as compared from Dover to Kent Ridge or Clementi to Kent Ridge.<br><br>d. NUS provides Free Shuttle Service between University Cultural Centre between Dover and Kent Ridge when there are performances, only reflects the more direct connection it has had over Clementi MRT and Kent Ridge.<br><br>e. A link between Dover and Kent Ridge would benefit students, though it might not be likewise for SBST. Since SBST had monopoly over 95 and 96. I would rather prefer TIBS to take up the challenge.<br><br>How do you think?<br><br></div>

SBST will want as much dividends as possible so I think they would leave it to NUS to set up their own shuttle.</div>
