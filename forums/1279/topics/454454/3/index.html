              <p>This might benefits those people going to Sengkang from
                  Woodlands and find svc 161/965 freq sucks.(Take svc168). Secondly,
                  I think the overhead bridge is extremely far from the bus stop, not
                  user-friendly. Thirdly, will someone send to LTA to simplified
                  their drawings? This looks slightly messy(although it's
                  understandable).</p>

              <p>Currently, 161 and 965 frequency is good..<br><br>I seriously hope that 858 and 969 will not serve this stop </p>

              <p>
              </p><p>If your judgement is that the four svcs cannot board at these stops, then I would rather the stop not to exist at all.</p>
              <p>3 - If you observe this svc, you will find that this svc can be worse than 27 sometimes. Its frequency is terrible enough, and to handle the corwd at Pasir Ris MRT, and other places, it will definitely have no more time left to stop at that stop. Otherwise you will just find 3 in a severe shortage of buses to handle the crowd.</p>
              <p>34 - No problem, it's fine for that svc to stop there</p>
              <p>39 - Another svc with horrible frequency. It is damn famous for its snail speed at TPE. Plus all that circling around at Pasir Ris, and the MRT crowd, I believe if 39 stop there the schedule will fall behind very much, and that the ride along the expressway will just take unbearably long.</p>
              <p>109 - Yet another one with very much a problem. Even after SBS fixed the frequency problem after these years, I STILL have to wait for at least 16 min for this bus, and 13 min at peak hrs. And, yes, in the morning/evening this bus get so damn crowded I seriously think the commuters at the new stops will not be able to even step into the bus. And the citaros - oh yes, the citaros, wonder if the bus goes up and down just for that stop I can imagine how dizzy some ppl can get, especially those sitting on the unbalanced seats facing behind.</p>
              <p>858 - The one with ULTIMATELY jialat frequency, the worst among all the svc mentioned above. Look at the queue at CGA. Even dunig off-peak u will find that bus leaving CGA with at least half the bus with standees, leave alone PEAK hours. And yes, by letting 858 stop at that bus stop will make it really unfair for Woodlands residents. Having 858 extended to Sembawang has already made enough trouble for them, want to make it worse?</p>
              <p>So in summary, only 34 is suitable to stop there (at least IMO), but what's the point of building a three-bus bus stop for then? This will in fact cause MORE jam at the oredi heavily-jammed Punggol Rd exit during evening peak. LTA, please think about it and just stop making such "mistakes" in the future, u hv made enough oredi.</p>
