            <div class='col-md body'>I remember of one case where BC went wrong direction. I was on a cameo bus, SBS 0069D on 225W going home. When the BC reached the T junction of Bedok North Avenue 2 and Bedok North Street 1, he went straight instead of turning into Avenue 2.<br><br>Then I could hear passengers from behind shouting "OEI! Wrong Direction!". BC apologised to all of us and made a U-turn outside Market and Food Centre Block 216. Soon we were back on track.<br><br>Anyone experienced the same thing before?</div>

Immediately, without hesitation, I shouted out in Chinese: "Hey! Shouldn't we be going straight?!".
