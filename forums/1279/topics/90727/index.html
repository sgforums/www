            <div class='col-md body'>It's true that sometimes SBS's service have deteriorated.  Example: sometimes u waited for longer than expected like 30 mins.  What u can do is complain to LTA by writing an e-mail to them.  It helps to shorten the waiting time in future.  I tried b4. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Other than the above situation, can try to complain but may of no use.  Anyway, it is in my opinion that the govt have intervened the transport industry.  They are trying to contain to 2 major bus operators to prevent them from becoming unprofitable.  Sad thing about Singapore.  Not that open afterall.</div>
