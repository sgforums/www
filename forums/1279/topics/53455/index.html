First on 854 at AMKDEP. I witnessed the first two O405's roll into AMKDEP with no license plates during their delivery ride while I was working there. They were numbered TIB 0000 W until a few weeks later they joined 854 with proper regos.<br><br>Later more O405's came and they went to KJDEP, then subsequently to WDLDEP, then see saw to KJDEP and back to WDLDEP again now.</div>

And it is quite a known fact that 190 at New Bridge Road draws buses from 176 at Bt Merah during evening peak hours.</div>

I had seen TIB426M on Services in Yishun with that weird rounded, especially brown-tinted window for a very long time until recently. It was always on service 856, at least until 1999 where it had a full Bendy fleet</div>

All the way. In fact it was the only distinguishable feature between the two prototype buses when they first arrived at AMKDEP in CBU state (later to become known as 425R and 426M). Before the buses got their proper regos the depot guys referred to the first prototype as the "square one" and the second prototype the "round one" due to the shape of the rear windscreen.</div>

I guess Hispano wanted TIBS to choose which windscreen they want.<br><br>Interestingly there was a mistake in the delivery of the prototypes. TIBS ordered two prototypes, one Air-con and one Non-aircon. Somewhere along the way the order got screwed a bit and Hispano bodied both with fixed windows and slapped a Hispacold each on both prototypes. But we wouldnt mind since it means more air-con buses, do we? :p Otherwise 426M would have been a Non-aircon bus initially.<br><br>The replacement prototype for a Non-aircon O405 didnt arrive until much later as TIB725A.</div>

And the merc logo on the radiator for confirmation. And some of their license plates, as far as I can remember, are:<br><br>SBS 1632 X<br>SBS 5574 D<br>SBS 5576 Z<br>SBS 5577 X<br>SBS 5583 G<br><br>They were leased to TIBS for normal route duties and considered part of TIB's operational fleet during the period of lease so obviously they were driven by TIBS drivers themselves.<br><br>They were used mostly in Sembawang and Yishun services as substitute buses. 169, 167, 800, 801, 802, 803 etc. They could only be used in these services because TIBS only printed the desto plates for these services specially for use on the OF1417's.<br><br>I have MSN but i cant use it in office.
