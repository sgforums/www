I will add you later on.</div></blockquote>OK, interesting, pity there are no photos available. Looks like they were used on Yishun feeders, and if I recall this happened around 1985 from other people's info? For how long were they used and what buses replaced them? Imagine seeing a SBS OF1417 in TIBS livery, would be fantastic.<br><br>AFAIK TIBS and SBST have different desto plate styles, don't they?

In fact the OF1417's were only part one of the solution to their shortage of buses. Part two were the terrible Hino BF177G's taken from CSS/SSB. Remember those Hino's with engines in the front and the exit door all the way at the back? They took 18 of the buses from CSS to be put into TIBS.

Which means they had leased about 30-odd buses from SBS and CSS? What was Sv. 164 route like before and after the cuts?<br><br>So I surmise after the cut of Sv. 164 the SBS OF1413s were returned to SBS while the Hino BF177Gs remained with TIBS? If I recall correctly Clemenceau Ave was reopened in 1990s with an exit from the CTE, only for the exit to be sealed again shortly after?

Service 804 load was getting heavier and heavier with neighbourhood 4 of Yishun booming up. And more people needed services from Woodlands to downtown. Woodlands was also crazily growing in population. And then there was the new service 805.<br><br>The BF177's were not really leased from CSS. TIBS did pay CSS the lease but CSS and TIBS were (and IS) the same company! The money transfer were more for accounting purposes. The BF177's had TIBS regos and NOT CSS regos. TIB362M to TIB 379R. Later on the Nissan U31RCN's re-used regos TIB362M to TIB377X. Good riddance to the BF177's.<br><br>Service 164 was not cut. It was totally withdrawn. Cancelled. Killed. Zip. At the same moment when 164 was cancelled, service 161 bit the stick and gave up all its Nissan U31S's and received a full fleet of all 18 BF177's in addtion to one solitary RK176 (TIB40S) in return. And not very much after that (when MRT came to Yishun), service 161 was withdrawn too. And that moment spelt the true end of the BF177's too.<br><br>So 3 things happened at one go in about 1987/1988 at the end of the recession:<br>1. 164 was cancelled<br>2. OF1417's returned to SBS<br>3. 161 became fully BF177<br>3a. BF177's kept fully away from other TIBS services</div>

It is only after they were transferred to TIBS and painted with TIBS colours before they had their regos re-registered as TIBS numbers.<br><br>I am not too sure about TIB390G/CSS294H, I think it was a gimmick from Nissan to persuade TIBS to choose them over Hino. Nissan was facing stiff competition from Hino for a 10 aircon bus tender which eventually resulted in TIBS buying 10 HT238 OACs in the form of TIB380K to TIB389L. Or it may be a complimentary bus from Nissan as a form of thanks, since TIBS bought so many U31's from them.<br><br>It wasnt totally free either, TIBS still had to fork out some money for COE, road tax, insurance, PARF/ARF etc etc though they got the bus for free.</div>

Then it had disappeared for quite some time when I found it on the feeder services at Woodlands Interchange. Then it disappeared again, and found it eventually on Service 61, knowing that TIB769Z must have landed up at either KJDEP or AMKDEP. Currently free agent ? It must have been. I thought it was deployed on Service 61, but often saw it without the Service number placed at the rear of the bus <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Later on the Nissan U31RCN's re-used regos TIB362M to TIB377X. Good riddance to the BF177's.<br><br>Service 164 was not cut. It was totally withdrawn. Cancelled. Killed. Zip. At the same moment when 164 was cancelled, service 161 bit the stick and gave up all its Nissan U31S's and received a full fleet of all 18 BF177's in addtion to one solitary RK176 (TIB40S) in return. And not very much after that (when MRT came to Yishun), service 161 was withdrawn too. And that moment spelt the true end of the BF177's too.<br><br>So 3 things happened at one go in about 1987/1988 at the end of the recession:<br>1. 164 was cancelled<br>2. OF1417's returned to SBS<br>3. 161 became fully BF177<br>3a. BF177's kept fully away from other TIBS services</div></blockquote>Yes, the OF1417's had a very suitable exhaust brake bellow.  They didn't sound breathless like the 1312's or the 1413's, although a 1418 and 1316 also sound pretty asthmatic.  I dread having rides on those thing here in Sydney or in Melbourne.  Weren't the buses leased from CSS to cover for the bus shortage Hino AK's?<br><br>AntiDennisLance, add me to msn as well, willya?  train_and_bus@hotmail.com and wk_120583_howdy@hotmail.com<br></div>
