              <p>hello guys i need some suggestions from you ppl</p>
              <p>my topic from this year is selection and i want to do some projects related to buses...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my teacher gave me a problem and i cant think of the solution:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>during peak hours, passengers on board does not want to move to the rear, resulting in some people from the next few stops not able to board the bus... i have to create a device that can make people move to the rear, to allow more passengers to board the bus... i do not need to modify the bus but just creating a device and adding to it... it just have to be simple artefact and battery operated if needed...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the objective of this problem situation:</p>
              <p>one of the reasons as mention aboved in the situation</p>
              <p>to save the hassle of BCs shouting at the passengers</p>
              <p>even if the BC is shouting, some passengers who are having their plugged may not hear the BC</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your serious suggestion is strongly appreciated, and it would be better if it could be linked to the topic: selection</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks</p>

              <p>You can include the SMRT on-board announcement system as part of your CURRENT SOLUTIONS. You can also include the notices put on some buses as part of it too. In my opinion, there's nothing much about SELECTION for buses. I tried doing something like a bus seat before for last year's O Level theme, TIDINESS, but my teacher was worried about the realisation process. So, i skipped it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think that it's more better if you do something like a light-up indicator where the BC press the button and then it lights up asking for the people to move in. However, i have my doubts whether it will satisfy the theme given since i think my suggestion has nothing to do with SELECTION at all. If you want to jump in and risk, try and argue in your design selection WHY you think this suggestion is related to SELECTION.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh ya, do note, try and save this suggestion. Meaning to say, you can just use CTRL+PrintScreen feature, paste it on Paint, save and print the reply out. You can make a new page inside the design folio and say that you went here and ask. Do be more detailed in explaining yourself in the folio on why you decided to ask here. It may help you in decision making later on.</p>

              <p>HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A UK P6 STUDENT WHO HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE AND WON AWARD BUT HE DOWAN TO TELL ME WHATS THE SOLUTION...</p>
              <p>ONE OF THE SUGGESTION HE GAVE WAS THAT A SENSOR COULD BE ADDED AT THE BACK OF THE BUS, WHEN THERE ARE FREE SPACES, IT WILL TRIGGER THE DEVICE TO GET THE PASSENGERS TO MOVE IN... JUST LIKE THOSE SENSOR OF THOSE IN THE CARPARKS WHEN A CAR IS PARKED AT THE LOT...</p>

              <p>I wanted to make something complicated before during my Ns and this year, my Os. But I told myself, alongside with the teachers comments, they say, just make something that won't take up too much time, not too complicated.</p>

              <p>I frequently see that happening on VO3Xs, especially at crowded
              bus stops, e.g. Rochor Canal Rd, everyone is standing at the edge
              of the road, and when 23 pulls in, some unfortunate person will get
              hit. Why wasn't it feasible?</p>

              <p>Yeah i thought of that too. What my intended idea was to install hydraulics. so that whenever the bus nears the bus stop, the mirror will auto retract back. Then when the bus leaves the bus stop it'll go back to its original position. </p>
              <p>My teacher told me it was too much of a hassle, i had to consult SBST and stuff, and she thought this problem was 'too big'.</p>
              <p>But seriously i thought that the warning stickers isnt enough. My sister's friend's mother got hit by a mirror and died from a head injury.So yeah.</p>

              <p>TIP! Add as much junk (that makes sense) in your research part. It makes you look like you're thinking and that your artefact has got lots of meaning.</p>
              <p>Eg. Your artefact is round, you say it's round to be like a wheel of a bus to follow the theme of the bus to catch the attention of children!</p>
              <p>You used green LED because your  teacher only got green but you say it's easier on the eyes of the commuters.</p>
