              <p>we all know that 198 is a wab certified service, and since this is a did you know thread, im sure everyone knows that 198 can take in PIW. even if its not so common to see PIWs onboard a wab certified service, but the truth is, everyone, if not most, already will know that its possible to see a PIW onboard a WAB certified service so i don't think that JaSoNhSu92 should post his findings here since its already known by many.</p>
              <p>i don't think JaSoNhSu92 nor Simple_boi is making a fuss and finding trouble but instead, <strong>you are. </strong>what i've said may apply to sinicker also. i do not want to go off-topic too much but just wanting to clarify some things here before another round of "flaming at each other" happens.</p>

              <p>i've nothing to say for the telling off part because what you've said is true. however, he could have posted it on the "Anything Unusual On the Roads", which i think is more suitable to post there than here because by seeing a PIW on board a WAB bus of a WAB certified service doesn't serve its purpose in this topic since its a "Did you know" topic when most or all have know that a PIW can board a WAB certified service, be it personally seen or heard. whereas in the "Anything Unusual On the Roads" topic, since its not so common to see a PIW onboard a WAB bus of a WAB certified service, and since the topic's purpose is not only cameos, so it should be posted there instead.</p>

              <p>i've nothing to say for the telling off part because what you've said is true. however, he could have posted it on the "Anything Unusual On the Roads", which i think is more suitable to post there than here because by seeing a PIW on board a WAB bus of a WAB certified service doesn't serve its purpose in this topic since its a "Did you know" topic when most or all have know that a PIW can board a WAB certified service, be it personally seen or heard. whereas in the "Anything Unusual On the Roads" topic, since its not so common to see a PIW onboard a WAB bus of a WAB certified service, and since the topic's purpose is not only cameos, so it should be posted there instead.</p>
              <p>it does make sense. nothing to say for this, either.</p>

              <p><br>There are errors in the history section. It was mentioned that the service was re-routed to Teban Gdns terminal in 1995, but as far as I know, the service was already terminating at Teban Gdns terminal a.k.a. Jurong Depot in the 80s.</p>
              <p>It was on 12 May 2002, not 2001, that the service was extended to Jurong East interchange skipping Pandan Gdns, then on 19 May 2002, Toa Payoh aircon interchange opened. On 17 Nov 2002, the service was re-routed to ply Pandan Gdns again.</p>
