              <p>its due to large traffic. theres just too many people in boon lay. also because there's poor and insufficient infrastructure to accomodate the huge capacity. such as lack of drop off points, poor loading and unloading facilities at jurong point, the overcrowded temporary boon lay interchange itself. temporary boon lay interchange is alr running way above full capacity and how is the new one gonna be effective when its smaller? merge  service and enhance them to joo koon and slbp? i doubt it would make a difference unless they remove 10 services from the current boon lay int.</p>
              <p>on the other hand as comparative to smoother traffic flows at interchanges like tampines, despite huge flow, good infrastructure has paved for smoother traffic flows. drop off points are located all over tampines ctrl, be at tampines station, century sq, tampines mall or any of the commericl buildings around it. tampines mall and century squares loading docks have efficient loading and unloading. but due to revamp of tampines int. the int itself is still rather messy but after the revamp it should all back to normal as how it previously was.</p>

              <p>Both are f***ed up. Tampines Int is too crowded (the town itself is badly planned, too big, dunno how it won the 1993 award), but good thing is that although Tampines Central has 2 big shopping malls (and one more coming up) and other commercial buildings, most of them are served by separate access roads. Boon Lay doesn't have any separate access roads, shared with buses, and things won't be better with the new interchange, the traffic lights will create jams during peak hours. Another thing is lifestyle, Tampines people love their bikes (no other town can beat the amount of bicycles per capita), Jurong people seem to love their cars, and also that Tampines have more neighbourhood centres which reduces the need for people to travel to the town centre.</p>

              <p>The problem is not with the bikes but the fact that ppl are nt moving towards the upper level of the bus. Makes no sense for SBS to make a half-empty bus running around. Better with the current deployment where 2 buses are placed near each other.</p>

              <p>How can u compare by just looking at the no. of cars going into JP and the no. of Lorries ?</p>
              <p>Dont forget that in Tampines, theres 2 BIG malls there and together with the East Point at Simei. The point is, because of that, the load can be said to be even out. As compared to the west side where theres only 1 mall that ppl goes to in the whole of Jurong Eas / West.</p>
              <p>From this, u can see that things and situations are very different between the 2 towns. Not forgetting, like what Scania had mentioned, the road network in the 2 towns are very different.</p>
              <p>But u still cant deny that Tampines Central will still be hit by traffic jams during the peak hours.</p>

              <p>You want to compare Neighbourhood centre ah? Tampines has N1 Neighbourhood Centre (got NTUC),  N2 Neighbourhood Centre, Tampines Mart (N3), N4 that side another NTUC, N8 Neighbourhood Centre (Prime), and another NTUC at Tampines Central CC.</p>
              <p>Why does Tampines need NTUC Xtra? It already got one big Giant at one side, need furniture also can go next door, need electronics, another door away.</p>
              <p>Why tampines mall tenant rate not so good ah, because of wide selection of shopping mall as around Tampines, 3 malls in Tampines Central alone and White Sands and Downtown East is nearby, you like also can take 27 or 34 to Changi Airport shop a while, if you want Sheng Shiong, take bus to Bedok Reservior. In and Around Jurong, you have JP, JE Central (which doesn't offer much), IMM (which eh is a bit inaccessible even though there's shuttle bus). I don't think many people would even go to West Mall just for shopping (its crap).</p>

              <p>A very interesting debate on shopping malls here...</p>
              <p>Until we get some hard statistics here as to how large JP's catchment area is compared to how large Tampines Central's catchment area is, we can't really compare just how popular JP is compared to Tampines Mall/Century Square etc.</p>
              <p>But speaking from a Tampines resident's POV, I guess we have been lucky that the authorities have had the foresight to improve Central 5 (the road leading to TM and CS carparks), from a two-way road to a totally one-way 2 lane road to a 3 lane road. As such, handling a large volume of traffic is no problem. The only problematic areas are the stretch of Ave 4 before the turn into Central 5, and the jam that occurs during peak hours when cars coming out of Central 6 have to deal with buses turning out of the interchange.</p>
              <p>@chickenlittle2<br>Source for the statement that tenant rate at Tampines1 is not good? AFAIK Tampines1 has been 90% taken up. Nice choice of anchor tenants, with a nice mix of stuff that is new to Tampines.</p>
              <p>And I don't think people from Tampines would go to White Sands or DT East to shop, since there isn't anything there that Tampines Ctrl doesn't have. No one goes to Changi Airport to shop, because everything there has its price inflated. Anyone else from Tampines to back me up?</p>
