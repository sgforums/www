            <div class='col-md body'><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong>Problem with CNG refuelling station leaves taxi drivers stuck in long queues</strong></span><br><br>SINGAPORE: It was not a good start to the New Year for many Prime taxi drivers.<br><br>Many were stuck in long queues because there was a problem with the only compressed natural gas or CNG refuelling station, located on Jurong Island.<br><br>A dissatisfied group of taxi drivers gathered outside the Prime Taxis office on 2 Jan to meet their management.<br><br>Prime Taxis is one of the smallest and newest players in the taxi market, with just under 100 cabs using Compressed Natural gas or CNG.<br><br>The drivers said that on New Year's Eve, a problem developed with the pumps at the only CNG refuelling station on Jurong Island.<br><br>So a usually-10-minute wait to fill their CNG tanks with gas, became a two to three hour affair.<br><br>Taxi-driver Charan Singh, said: Â“Problem is that (when the) gas pump station breaks down, we cannot get gas (and) have to queue for 2 to 3 hours. One day too times how many hours I lose? How to continue driving like this? Now the fares are so bad and business is dull - how to manage the rental?"<br><br>Another taxi-driver, Tan Ah Kin, said:"We used to drive 10-12 hours one day - now at the very most you can drive 4-5 hours. So the waiting time is going to kill us."<br><br>What is worse is that the company has not raised its metered fares and won't do so for at least three months.<br><br>The company has only imposed the city surcharge from 1 Jan 2008 but most passengers don't know this.<br><br>So the drivers are suffering the same drop in business as other cab drivers by as much as 30 per cent.<br><br>In a statement, SembCorp Industries, which runs the CNG station, said one of its two compressors had an unusual malfunction and the spare part that is needed should arrive within a week.<br><br>In the meantime, the company is exploring all possible solutions and has advised some users to switch to petrol for now.<br><br>Prime Taxi management said it is still working out solutions to alleviate the taxi driversÂ’ woes.<br><br>This includes possible rental rebates and petrol vouchers.<br><br>Mr Tan Soon Chye, General Manager of the Taxi Division for Prime Car Rental and Taxi Services, said: Â“While the gas company is doing their best to rectify the situation, we at Prime Taxis had a dialogue with taxi masters and we have worked out a package to alleviate their problems at this time while the pump is undergoing repair."<br><br>One of the main problems that has left taxis idling is that there is only one CNG refuelling station in Singapore which is located on Jurong Island.<br><br>However, three more such refuelling stations are expected to open throughout the rest of the year with the next one expected to open in about two weeks time. -CNA/vm<br></div>

He is on the losing end yet he is trying to cook up excuses. And when SBS9888Y is trying to clear his stand and SBS8043A is giving his own opinions, how can that ayam accuse SBS9888Y = SBS8043A?<br><br>I know SBS9888Y in person, and he isn't those sort of boliao person who create clone account. Even if he created a clone account, would he be such a fool to type in the similar way? If yes, he would be asking for trouble! I can guarantee you SBS9888Y isn't SBS8043A, and if you are against SBS9888Y, please don't drag SBS8043A into the picture. Both are separate cases for you to deal with.<br><br>I don't care who are against you or not. But the way you are trying to argue doesn't make yourself look like an adult but an empty minded ayam. So should I still respect you? As an adult you should be more open minded. Don't you feel the shame when those younger members you consider as kids flame you? If you were good, no one would look you up for trouble. There's no need to argue back when you made a mistake. Just accept it and move on. I am terribly upset that you can actually try to accuse SBS9888Y is SBS8043A.<br><br>I am not trying to stand up for SBS9888Y. He may have made some unconstructive comments in the forum but at least I know his character isn't as bad as you think. If you still want to insist that you are right and still want to argue all the way, I have nothing more to comment about you. Think about it.</div></blockquote>x2!!<br><br>SBS8043A is an adult forummer while SBS9888Y is a teenager. And looking at the posts I don't think SBS9888Y would be so bored to create clone accounts.<br><br>So how can 8043A = 9888Y? Although both post in a familar way but that doesn't mean that they are the same. <strong>Do not judge a book by it's cover.</strong></div>
