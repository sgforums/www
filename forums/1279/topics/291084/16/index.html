I dun had any hatredness cos when I always see how the people write here makes me laugh. I am happy to see  the way you reply and especially you who take things seriously but also finding lots of excuse to cover yourself. When u start ur reply, u would say me "Senseless commments", "no pride" and etc. Like I say remember who starts the so called"argument" indirectly.  Dun mind if I say that to u, I do not know where I offended you but u just want to argue with me when I am actually not really interested it in. I think focusing too much of me and bargain with me for small matters. That dun make u look like the moderator as u dun look professional at all. You are far away from the others moderator.<br><br>Btw, wat kind of evidence are u talking about? I do show some examples<br><br>My colleague who look at this forum felt that it was the funniest forum rhey had even seen before. Reason? They felt that the comments shown are very bias. From the comments they read, they conclude that young Singaporean are good in talking and "Por" on others but not good in hands -on.<br><br>In conclusion, just a few suggestion and hope we can stop the so called "arguement" or flame.<br><br>1st. Do not quickly get agitated when you see something u dun like, reply in a nice way.<br><br>2nd. Stand up for ur own comments, do not be affected.<br><br>3rd. Listen more to others first,  don't jump in and scold or insult anyone.<br><br>4th. For those pple who like to "Por", I had no say cos u all are just a bunch of brainless creatures.<br><br><strong>5th. Ask ur qns properly or reply directly and not beat around the bush.</strong></div>
