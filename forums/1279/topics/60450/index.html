The Malaysian government is building a bridge to replace the Causeway and developing a waterfront city along the coast. Many roads have been closed / diverted due to this project. Even the local buses will not be stopping at City Square. All bus services will be diverted to Kota Raya 2, which is the site of the old JB Bus Station. This is where the Causeway Link buses stop. There's no reason to switch as it is much easier to walk to City Square from the checkpoint than from Kota Raya 2. It's an inconvenience but it's only temporary. I hope. Maybe arragements are being made for 170 to stop at Kota Raya 2 as well?<br><br>And speaking of Kota Raya 2, remember Causeway Link's proposed express route to Queen St? The buses intended for this service can be spotted there. They're MAN 18.310.</div>
