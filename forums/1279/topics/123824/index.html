And swinging about? It sure is dangerous, a bit of steering and the bus will bite the dust. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It appears you are the joker which needs some waking up.<br>Same too for those joker traffic policemen who seems to have nothing else better to 'book' than for such cases of so-called 'speeding' !!!!<br><br>From personal experiences of using the SJE over many years, it's very obvious (to me least) that the 'speed limits' are too unrealistically LOW in much of the times on those expressways !<br><br>It's absolutely stupid, impractical even inefficient ! to reasonably expect a modern bus (even an articulated one !) or coach to 'crawl' along such expressways @ what ?? 60 km/h ?!!?? as if they're driving on a normal (i.e. non expressway road) ?? What you think they're doing then ?? Watching the night sky for bats, admiring the scenery etc. ? I'm very sure the drivers &amp; the passengers too ! have many other better things to do than wasting their time &amp; patience putting up with such artificially low speeds in such driving environments !!!!<br><br>Therefore i have to fully sympathise with the drivers of buses &amp; coaches in such situations ! It's only a matter of course then that they have to so-call 'speed' on such roads whenever reasonably possible, to make the most sense out from driving under those circumstances !!!! Any policemen who tries to 'book' such motorists are really stupid condemned idiots who deserve to be placed into the same shoes of such bus or coach drivers for them to experience 1st hand what the ridiculous circumstances of such REAL road hogging is like ! Then (if they're of sound minds) they're expected to understand why such so-called 'speeding' instances are practically sensible &amp; justified afterall !!<br><br>It has been known that the vast majority of accidents in the world does NOT occur @ high speeds on the highways BUT @ 'quite low' speeds @ traffic junctions instead !!!! The probability of an accident occuring @ high speed on a highway is also known to be LESS than on a normal road @ low speeds.<br><br>Therefore looking only @ speed per se to decide if that is 'unsafe' or 'dangerous' or not is over simplistic shallow mindedness, say the least !<br><br>You can be driving @ only 40 km/h along a small &amp; winding narrow road &amp; still you're NOT automatically 'safer' than if driving @ 100 km/h or higher on a wide straight &amp; open highway with plenty of view ahead !<br><br>So it really boils down to speed management rather than speed itself !<br><br>It's definitely OK to drive fast, especially even on a modern bus or coach or van etc., BUT under the appropriate driving circumstances, which ARE available quite often, even when on the expressways here.<br><br>What can be done instead is to have seperate lanes for PSV's like minibuses or full size buses &amp; coaches on the expressways, something like the Mercedes-Benz O-Bahn system, although in this case forget about the tracks just place say kerbs to physically seperate the cars from the buses etc. This way, like in the real O-Bahn system, the buses &amp; coaches can 'speed' up to 100 km/h on their 'own road' on the same expressway as the cars yet won't get in the way of the cars or vice-versa !<br><br>So you have this 'high speed' lane for PSV's on the middle-left of the expressway while the extreme left lane for other commercial vehicles who can only manage a lower speed &amp; keeping the rest of the expressway clear mainly for the lighter weight vehicles like cars.<br><br>That'll certainly make 'much more sense' out of the situation @ hand for drivers of the respective vehicle types &amp; traffic moves on the expressways @ a quicker &amp; more efficient &amp; practical pace for everybody, WITHOUT compromising safety in any significant manner !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tomas_Rosicko:</div><div class="quote_body">last night i saw a Singapore-Johor Express bus kenna booked by traffic police on the road shoulder along BKE towards PIE, presumably for speeding, rare scenario as i have never encountered a bus or taxi kenna summoned by TP before hahaha...<br><br>i drive along BKE frequently, have noticed that many a time lots of Singapore-Johor Express buses often use the centre lane and travel as high as 70-80km/h, overtaking many smaller vans and lorries at the left lane...these Singapore-Johor Express drivers think they are driving a sports car....na beh, or think they are driving on malaysian roads...aren't these jokers aware that they are driving a heavy vehicle and are supposed to keep to the left lane?????<br><br>only our SMRT buses (187, 190, 700, 960, 963, 966) kept to the left lane and abide by the speed limit<br><br>Those Singapore-Johor Express buses are really atrocious and deserve being summoned and fined.<br><br>Also along SLE, i've noticed lots of blue colored Johor factory buses speeding on the centre lane...whereas our SBST buses (161 and 16<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> along SLE kept to their speed limit..hope the TP nab these Johor buses...<br><br>have u guys ever encountered a bus or taxi stopped by TP and kenna booked?</div></blockquote></div>
