            <div class='col-md body'>On the North-South highway, it's practically OK &amp; sufficiently 'safe' to go even 130 km/h or slightly above in certain circumstances, especially on a modern &amp; competent coach or van etc.<br><br>100 km/h (whether in car or coach) can be too slow in such circumstances !<br>So to me i'll NOT necessary consider that as 'speeding' ! The fellor's probably just trying to drive @ more productive &amp; efficient speed given the driving environment @ hand ! He's not doing sighseeing i believe !<br><br>These policemen need to drive some coaches to better appreciate the circumstances before making any such 'bookings'. Most often, the 'speed limits' tend to be too artificially low &amp; people are merely trying to drive @ a more reasonable, efficient speed from their own driving experiences.<br><br>The fact that they are still alive &amp; driving shows that their past driving experiences &amp; judgement do hold water.

            <div class='col-md body'>60 km/h is definitely too SLOW much of the time on the expressway, going from my personal experiences using SJE many years now.<br><br>Much of the time fortunately i'll say, i note the SJE vehicles go from 60 km/h to 100 km/h while on the expressway, which i seriously consider as reasonable, given the driving environment @ hand ! 60 km/h or slower for too long is simply ridiculous then !<br><br>Even SJE's lousy old MAN's do exceed 60 km/h. Their newer Scania K94, K113 ? &amp; of course the flagship twin-piped M-B OH 1627 L can all do 100+ km/h, in almost deaf-silence in the V8's case.

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course you don't 'blindly' drive @ 120 km/h all the time !<br>Worth looking out for signs of strong crosswinds whenever on the highways !<br>That's why they provide those coffee bag wind indicators !<br>Then you slow down accordingly.<br><br>I've taken even 1.5 decker coaches (i.e. slightly higher than high height single-deck coach but ~ 0.5m lower height than double-deckers) based on Scania L94 chassi on the PlusLiner &amp; never encountered 'involuntary' 'swing abouts' !<br>Same too of course on the numerous trips i've taken using single high deck coaches over the last decade on the N-S highway. Good &amp; lousy makes &amp; models of bus-chassi i've sampled much of what's there over the years &amp; have to say, somehow it's a 'managable' situation not a dangerous one i'll say.<br><br>I do believe such 'swinging' incidents, if any, tend to be deliberately caused by some impatient drivers trying to cut in &amp; out of traffic. While i don't approve of such behaviour, somehow local drivers 'know' &amp; 'understand' such driving 'techniques' practised &amp; give in accordingly such that although in theory it seems dangerous, in reality people there learnt to live with it (literally !) &amp;<br>the fact they remain alive tells me somehow it's 'under control' &amp; 'tolerable'.<br><br>Modern especially the high end coaches do have adequete margins of active safety features to counter any such situations. Bearing in mind almost all the reputable makes of coaches come from countries of origin where the local driving conditions are far more 'dangerous' than what you have in Singapore &amp; Malaysia, which really is 'chickenfeed' to them to handle !! If they can make it through ice &amp; snow etc., i see no good reason why they cannot make it through on the dry even wet highways here !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS1908B:</div><div class="quote_body">I hate to say this, but the coaches tend to swing about when they exceed 120km/h, it is really dangerous if you ask me.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a photo which shows an M-B O 303 coach driven on test track such that the coach is tilted up to 60 degrees relative to the horizontal ground with the driver still managed to drive it ! On the same photo, they also show an M-B S-Class car driven @ 90 degrees (to the horizontal).<br><br>Of course the speeds must be very fast to ensure that centrifugal forces can keep the vehicles on the road &amp; they don't roll over !<br><br>So the fact they can put up with such extreme conditions, what then are the 'normal' even highway driving conditons here compared to that ??!!<br>Chickenfeed in comparison.<br><br>Taking into account the engine performance on the O 405, i believe given the use of appropriate gear ratios, an O 405 can go as fast as 130 km/h if not higher. I find M-B (air-suspended) buses offer good handling characteristics. Of course the margin of active safety on their spring suspended models (as is the case with the other 'lesser' makes i'll say) is somewhat lower &amp; these are nowhere as 'dynamically' competent !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">I've taken an O.405 (both turbo and non-turbo) to 115km/h and there was no swinging to speak of... just too much wind resistance...and the governor wasn't workign at the time (it kicks in at 100km/h).</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The MAN buses like the 18.280, 18.310, 18.400 and 24.460 are manufactured in Malaysia. MAN have a bus assembly line there. The basic structure is constructed locally while the major components, such as the engine block and suspension, are acquired from the parent company in Germany. As such, you are able to see CBU MAN buses in Malaysia. This helps to reduce costs as compared to importing the chassis from abroad. Which is why MAN buses are favourable to many operators and are replacing other brands such as Hino and Nissan. I find it surprising that Singapore operators are turning a blind eye for quality buses at close proximity and low cost.<br><br>Speaking of Hino, they too have an assembly line in Malaysia. The Hino AK, RK and RM range are all manufactured locally. This explains the abundance of Hino buses in the country.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you say CBU MAN buses, i take it to mean MAN integrally constructed complete buses with original MAN bodies. So is that the case in Malaysia ?<br>I believe in KL they use the SL252 citybus but i suspect it's not 100% original MAN stuff (the rear lampset doesn't look too consistent with MAN design) but a very close copy by HICOM ? Anycase from personally ever riding in it before in KL, i found the bodywork build &amp; finishing quality better than the Alexander, Duple Metsec even Volgrens in Singapore !<br><br>Based on your description, i'll say only the MAN bus in chassi form is assembled in Malaysia via CKD mode. Having seen a 24.460 from Malaysia it's quite obvious to me the design &amp; styling of the double-decker coachwork used was sourced from some (likely Malaysian) 3rd party coachbuilder, not original MAN body from Germany in CKD form.<br><br>Mercedes-Benz, Saab-Scania etc. also have production &amp; assembly plants in lower cost centres like Latin America. I believe Malaysian cost levels are getting more expensive with time &amp; German design products made &amp; assembled in say China, India or Brazil can be extremely competitively priced too while keeping within acceptable levels of quality.<br><br>In Hino's case, you saying they make &amp; assemble the entire bus-chassi in Malaysia ? Or rather they import the pre-made parts in CKD form for assembly there ?<br><br>Singapore operators i'll say will need time to update themselves on the latest situation. Understandably, the level of trust on direct Europe sourced stuff remains much higher.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The MAN buses like the 18.280, 18.310, 18.400 and 24.460 are manufactured in Malaysia.
