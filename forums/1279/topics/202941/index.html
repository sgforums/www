How do I use my Ez-link card correctly when travelling on buses?<br><br>2. Sometimes, two buses of the same service arrive at the same time with one bus being overcrowded and the other almost empty. Why?<br><br>3. It is easier for me to alight from the bus if I stand near the exit door, why should I move to the rear of the bus?<br><br>4. Why does the Bus Captain drive so slowly?<br><br>5. Can SBS Transit deploy more air-conditioned buses?<br><br>6. Some of the air-conditioned buses are either too cold or too warm. Why cant the Bus Captain adjust the temperature?<br><br>7. Are animals allowed on buses and trains?<br><br>8. Sometimes, Bus Captains refuse to open the door for me despite seeing me trying to catch the bus. Why?<br><br>9. The bus advertisements pasted on the bus windows get in our way. Can the advertisements be removed?<br><br>10. The programmes on TV Mobile are either in English or Mandarin. How about Malay or Tamil progammes? Also, the sound is too loud. Why cant we have a peaceful bus ride?<br><br>11. Why is it that bus services serving my estate do not go to where I want directly but requires me to transfer?<br><br>12. What is the purpose of having short trips?<br><br>13. Why does SBS Transit seem to be looking only at fare increase to improve their profits?<br><br>14. What is Vehicle Location System?<br><br>15. The Ez-link card reader deducted my fare wrongly. How do I get a refund?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Article from <strong><span style="color: red;">TODAY</span></strong> Voices, 3 Aug 2006.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">For a cleaner, spacious ride</span></strong><br>Commuters make known their choices<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yvonne Lim<br>Voices &amp; Commentary editor</span><br><br>AS the Public Transport Council (PTC) turned up the heat on SMRT and SBS Transit to meet defined service standards ("Getting buses shipshape", July 27), ahead of the impending fare hikes, commuters got down to dirty business.<br><br>That is to say, a fair number of readers asked for public transport operators to be taken to task also for the state of cleanliness on their buses.<br><br>As Diana Tan, who wrote in to agree with letter writer Graham McEune ("Flag down those bus bugbears", July 29), put it: "<span style="color: red;">Dirty floors and windows that look like they have never been cleaned Â— I don't know what tourists think, especially when the rest of Singapore is so clean. As any housewife will tell you, a mop, a bucket and a wet cloth are all you need. Could someone tell SBS this?</span>"<br><br>To be fair, the transport operator's efforts do go further than this. Referring to its previous response to similar complaints, See Leong Kit noted: "SBS Transit's reply, that buses are given a thorough cleaning and fumigation once a month, with the bus drivers doing a quick sweep daily with broom and dustpan, is unacceptable."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Harking back to perennial complaints about stuffy air-conditioning, mouldy air-con vents, cockroaches and mosquitoes, he asked if such "sloppy attention" to public hygiene could have contributed to the seasonal flu outbreak.</span>.<br><br>See suggested the PTC impose standards on maintenance and hygiene. "After the buses stop operating, bring in cleaning contractors with heavy-duty vacuum cleaners to thoroughly clean the buses daily. <span style="color: red;">Areas where many hands have touched, such as grab poles and pull handles, should be wiped with disinfectant</span>."<br><br>Other common bugbears included the advertisements pasted over bus windows and inadequate leg space.<br><br>Raymund Koh, for instance, complained to SMRT that he felt "particularly squeezed in the seat just behind the first exit door" of a "bendy bus".<br><br>He received <span style="color: red;">the response that seats were fitted by the manufacturer based on the regulated 23cm of space.<br><br>"People of the current generation are generally much taller. Our public buses have very little leg room between seats, which tall passengers like myself cannot squeeze into</span> on long journeys. We need to sit slanting," he said.<br><br>Soh Poh Huat was glad the PTC was "finally" proposing to lay down the law on bus frequencies and waiting times, among other things. But he wondered <span style="color: red;">when it would extend the service standards to "buses not stopping close to bus bays to facilitate boarding/alighting", and "bus captains who fail to ensure the elderly, expectant mothers or parents carrying children are seated prior to driving off</span>".<br><br>His suggestion: That PTC set up an automated system to which commuters can instantly SMS their feedback. The authorities could then generate monthly reports. "For example, if there are more than X number of complaints, fines can be imposed," he wrote.<br><br>Going down a somewhat tangential road, Seah Leong Khai wonders if the PTC can extend its purview to commuter behaviour as well.<br><br>"<span style="color: red;">We hear complaints about passengers not giving up their seats to those who need it. Why should we, full fare-paying adults, be made to stand, while able-bodied young people on concessionary fares sit to enjoy the ride?</span>"<br><br>What he wants: For PTC to make it compulsory for students and national servicemen to give up their seats to senior citizens, pregnant women and other adults when the bus is full. Inspectors could enforce this.<br><br>"This makes business sense. Full-fare paying passengers should have priority over those who pay discounted fares, except for senior citizens. In other businesses such as air travel, you get priority when you pay a premium," he argued.</div>
