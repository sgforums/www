              <p><br>well it's unlikely for SMRT to operate e shuttles in tat scale. dun forget e gag order on TIB/ SMB plates during peak hrs.</p>
              <p>actually I dun see it tis way, lesser $$ spent on these buses = more taxable profit on e gambling tax for e govt. Tat is since they decide to micromanage looking at e Casino only, w/o looking at USS.</p>

              <p>e likely problems for those affected.</p>
              <p>1) Pte Bus operator: Excess drivers.</p>
              <p>2) Mostly PRC bus distributor: Fate to lelong those now unwanted buses. Likely more competition on a smaller demand.</p>
              <p>3) More demand for Sentosa Express, more packed.</p>
              <p>4) Lesser family crowd to expect from USS - likely to affect takings.</p>

              <p>Then stop increasing the population, Singapore cannot afford to cater the needs for the increasing population. We are good enough with 4 million people in Singapore. No need so many people crowded in a small country fighting for resources and space and get over charged for these because of limited resources and space.</p>
              <p>I don't mind taking a bus everyday to school and work, but not for leisure and entertainment with my friends and family. Imagine being broken up by crowds in buses and MRT and couldn't feel the closeness and saying anything private we want with our family and friends. I don't want this kind of life for my family in future.</p>
              <p>Car growth population is still possible, else many Singaporeans are going to make a lot of noise in future. And don't forget car sales are still one of the factors that move the local retails up and a revenue for the govt. And who are going to fund for the road infrastructures and expansions the govt have done in the past, present and future??? The car owners, of course. Just that to cater the needs for Singaporeans to own a car, and limited land space, we might see more elevated roads and undergorund tunnel roads in future.</p>

              <p>Not just families, sometimes some of my friends got stuck in the front of the bus while some of us managed or in fact, advised by the BC to move in so that more people can board the bus. In the end, our conversation got cutted. sad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>But while in my friend's car, we can chatted happliy and loudly from start till the end of journey.</p>
              <p>And think of our parents who grow old in future, do you want them to walk up and down, to and fro, just to make multiple transfers to go to a place???</p>
              <p>And our kids, especially when they are so small and babies using prams??? I don't want to make my family to carry so many things and walk and wait so much, just to make transfers again and again to go to a place. Then might as well we stay at home to be couch potatoes.</p>

              <p>If you are worried about carbon footprint, buy a hybrid/electric car or opt for installing a CNG tank in your car. You still save the environment while having a good time with your family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
