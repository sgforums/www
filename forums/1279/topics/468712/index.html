              <p>Just reached home and WRI had a very bad jam. </p>
              <p>It all started when 904A (WLDEP/WRBP 900) was declared breakdown in the middle of the interchange and the mechanic plus the SL was wet due to exposure to the rain.</p>
              <p>Then 1129P and SMB336S of 912 and 187 took a hard time to reverse and trying to squeeze on the side of 904A. </p>
              <p>Then all the bunching of bus happens to the point that 969 queue stretched out to the counter and sadly 527E was the one tanking the load. </p>
              <p>At 5pm, WRI got another jam at the 966 side. Alot of buses was honking and certain bus didnt move for a period of 10 mins like 528C,SMB240J and many others including bendies. </p>
              <p>At 5.15pm the tow truck appeared in my line of sight and it too get stuck in the jam. Took at least 15 minutes to weave through the jam and finally coming to the aid of 904A.</p>
              <p> When my bus (858) left, I saw SBS7597A, SBS7667G,SBS7573T,SBS7606H and SBS7610U trailing behind. 5 168 buses just bunched up at the interchange after taking pax. </p>

              <p>Idk if 904A is the root cause of the congestion but 969 area was clear after a while, Bus entering the bus park is the one that is congested to the max even 5 168 perm buses with pax all left WRI at the same time.</p>
              <p>5 Dec 2011 that one is the worst because i have to drop outside the interchange and walk in. Didnt see any pax alighting outside interchange just now</p>

              <p>904A broke down just a few metres away from the 900 berth so its ave 7 bound. From ave 7 going into WRI is really bad. Buses coming ave 3 goes in WRI smoothly but got stucked in the jam </p>
