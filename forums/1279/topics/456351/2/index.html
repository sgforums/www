              <p>I cannot help it I just needed to post another comment!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Eh Kuek, what's your plan after this? You are already Chief of Army.</p>
              <p>Kuek : Ermm dunno leh.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Ermm wanna join PAP in politics?</p>
              <p>Kuek: I dunno. I can meh?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: How about CEO of SMRT? The last person screwed up. We need a tough cookie, maybe an ex-military guy to tekan the staff and with knowledge of logistical and operational coordination. Plus you will not dare to question the govt and if we push the fault to you, you will take it LIKE A MAN!</p>
              <p>Kuek: Ermm okay. How much is the pay? How many days leave of absence do I get?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: I ask the HR for you. So how? Want or not?</p>
              <p>Kuek: Can lah. Or else I only can sell insurance when I leave Army. So better be CEO mah. Like that I got face in front of my family and friends. But what does a CEO do hah?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: On! So I get you the application form, you fill in and submit by tomorrow ok? CEO ah? Very easy one if we appoint you. You just do like you did before in Army lor. Arrow here and there. Make people do the work then you take credit to present. Sometimes talk cock sing song can already.</p>
              <p>Kuek: What if I dunno how to fill in the experience section? Later my application kenna rejected, so malu!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: DON'T WORRY. We will help you one! You dunno who I am meh?</p>
              <p>Kuek: Orh. You say one ah! Dun pray pray with me hah.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Relax lah bro! I will settle for you!</p>
              <p>Kuek: Okay! Heng ah! No more Chief of Army but can be Chief Executive Officer leh! Still got the title Chief and Officer! Steady liao.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Ahh you see. I picked you is becoz you smart and can read between the lines! And SMRT is an abbreviation that spell like SMART without the A only.</p>
              <p>Kuek: So do I have a RSM to do my dirty work?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: HALLO! You have a secretary and many managers! You can make them do all the dirty work you want. You no need to wash the trains, relax.</p>
              <p>Kuek: Wah! So good one! Be CEO damn shiok leh!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Ah but then!</p>
              <p>Kuek: Ermm my wife calling me.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Ok lah. Remember to submit application by tomorrow hah.</p>
              <p>*click*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>:D</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And then the other side of the conversation with SMRT HR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: We have identified a very capable person to take on the CEO role for SMRT.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Izzit? Who?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: The would be former Chief of Army lor. Kuek.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Who?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Errr nevermind. I say who means who. Send him the application form. </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : But does he has experience in the public transport sector or any similar organisation as their top man?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: SAF transport not big enough izzit? He Chief of Army leh. Got Air, Sea and Land, what else you want?</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Like tat ah. But why you don't ask him to join PAP instead?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: We heard he loved the field command too much and we worry he may get our PAP's super Dyanmo white washed uniform dirty. You know lah, some Army man just love to roll around mud and dust. Bad for PAP image.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : I see. So how much do we pay him?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Of coz more than his current salary and must match other CEOs or even more! After all we need to ensure he is motivated and our CEOs must be well paid so that they can talk to other CEOs at the same level, if not higher. We cannot pay him low pay or else how he do his job?!</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Budget leh sir.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Budget can change one! You think I here as Minister for fun izzit? The most we increase the fares loh! Piang!</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Then the public will complain again and especially if they know it is coz we paying the new CEO high pay!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: You see. That's why you were never considered for the CEO position. You are not flexible enough and you do not know how to twist the story a bit, like any top man of a big organisation. Just any how make up a reason lah! </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Like tat ah. If you say so, so be it. But the story must ask PR dept.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Of coz. I will speak to them next. Okay so settle, you give him the application form and let him fill up. If he dunno how to fill the experience section, call me and I tell you how to fill. Can fill what, just fill what. Even small thing make like big thing so that people cannot complain that he not qualified.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : What else does he need?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Make sure you standby many secretaries and office boys for him to select. We need to transition him into the CEO role from the Army and he also need people to make coffee for him as well as run around to handle his chores, like checking if he locked his car, which he may have forgotten. We are all humans, we forget simple things like this. I also have a office boy. Becoz last time I also Army man.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Anything else?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: You all got metal polisher not? Get a lot of it.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Why?!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: I think he may wanna polish the tracks every night from now on and have inspection daily. </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Huh?!! Serious ah? Anything else?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Perhaps we need to build a parade square. You know? Coz I think he may miss the occasional parade atmosphere where he can sing Marikita and see the flag being raised and perhaps even do the military salute.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Ermmm.</p>

              <p>Possibly a Minister: We have identified a very capable person to

              <p>SMRT HR : Izzit? Who?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: The would be former Chief of Army lor.
              Kuek.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Who?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Errr nevermind. I say who means who. Send
              him the application form. </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : But does he has experience in the public transport
              sector or any similar organisation as their top man?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: SAF transport not big enough izzit? He
              Chief of Army leh. Got Air, Sea and Land, what else you want?</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Like tat ah. But why you don't ask him to join PAP
              instead?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: We heard he loved the field command too
              much and we worry he may get our PAP's super Dyanmo white washed
              uniform dirty. You know lah, some Army man just love to roll around
              mud and dust. Bad for PAP image.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : I see. So how much do we pay him?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Of coz more than his current salary and
              must match other CEOs or even more! After all we need to ensure he
              is motivated and our CEOs must be well paid so that they can talk
              to other CEOs at the same level, if not higher. We cannot pay him
              low pay or else how he do his job?!</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Budget leh sir.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Budget can change one! You think I here as
              Minister for fun izzit? The most we increase the fares loh!
              Piang!</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Then the public will complain again and especially if
              they know it is coz we paying the new CEO high pay!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: You see. That's why you were never
              considered for the CEO position. You are not flexible enough and
              you do not know how to twist the story a bit, like any top man of a
              big organisation. Just any how make up a reason lah! </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Like tat ah. If you say so, so be it. But the story
              must ask PR dept.</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Of coz. I will speak to them next. Okay so
              settle, you give him the application form and let him fill up. If
              he dunno how to fill the experience section, call me and I tell you
              how to fill. Can fill what, just fill what. Even small thing make
              like big thing so that people cannot complain that he not
              qualified.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : What else does he need?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Make sure you standby many secretaries and
              office boys for him to select. We need to transition him into the
              CEO role from the Army and he also need people to make coffee for
              him as well as run around to handle his chores, like checking if he
              locked his car, which he may have forgotten. We are all humans, we
              forget simple things like this. I also have a office boy. Becoz
              last time I also Army man.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Anything else?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: You all got metal polisher not? Get a lot
              of it.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Why?!</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: I think he may wanna polish the tracks
              every night from now on and have inspection daily. </p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Huh?!! Serious ah? Anything else?</p>
              <p>Possibly a Minister: Perhaps we need to build a parade square.
              You know? Coz I think he may miss the occasional parade atmosphere
              where he can sing Marikita and see the flag being raised and
              perhaps even do the military salute.</p>
              <p>SMRT HR : Ermmm.</p>
