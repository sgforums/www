With bendies, passengers can quickly do boarding and alighting activities, even though I has gotten onto the second deck when the bus is just a stone's throw away from the Bus Interchange.<br><br>However, the problem we need to think of is the ability to manouvere, that is whether it can move around even though it's long. Also, special parts and special care is needed to take care of these buses. Singapore dosen't have enough resources and like SBS Transit, they sold off their two bendies citing reasons such as infrastructural constrains and maintainence, along with a list of other reasons.<br><br>And if it's a short haul service from where you're boarding, we know that some would be too lazy to go up. By the way, everything has it's advantages and disadvantages.</div>

Remember route 804 before it was amended? The images of MB O405 buses packed to the brim, from front door to the absolute rear, at night after peak hours are still fresh on my mind. Yet, TIBS (and later SMRT) couldn't do anything about it - bendy buses were out of the question then thanks to route 804's need then to u-turn at the then-future junction of Yishun Avenue 1 and Yishun Street 41. If SBS Transit were to take over the control of route 804 (or if then-TIBS used double-decker buses), we could have seen double-decker buses being deployed on that route then to solve the overcrowding problem much earlier on.<br><br>And what about route 962? I still remember it in the days before the stretch of Sembawang Drive from Admiralty Street to Admiralty Link was completed. Route 962 then had zero bendy buses, because it needed to u-turn at the junction of Admiralty Link with Sembawang Drive (it was a through road at that time if my hazy memory serves me right). I remember seeing an off-service bendy bus making a u-turn there, and I always suspect that that occasion was a failed experiment to see whether bendy buses could go on route 962 at that time. Not until it was extended to Admiralty Street (which had a specially-built roundabout just to allow bendy buses to make a u-turn) were bendy buses put on it.</div>
