            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: The Public Transport Council has revised the service guidelines for public buses to help ensure they meet specific standards, and with recent changes to the law, it will, for the first time, have the teeth to enforce compliance.<br><br>Service standards for buses have actually been in place since 1994.<br><br>The problem was they were route specific and there were no penalties if they were not complied with.<br><br>Bus commuters would identify with the main problems highlighted in a survey done by the Public Transport Council.<br><br>Waiting for buses was top on the complaint list, followed by over-crowding and long travel times to complete a bus journey.<br><br>All this changed in April this year when the PTC Act was amended, giving the council new powers to ensure compliance and impose fines if standards are not met.<br><br>The standards cover six essential aspects of service -<br><br>* Bus service reliability - for example, at least 85 percent of bus services should not deviate more than 5 minutes from the scheduled frequency<br>* Loading - for example, weekday peak period bus loading shouldn't exceed 95 percent<br>* Safety<br>* Provision of information<br>* Availability of bus services<br>* Integration with other modes of public transport<br><br>Designed to overcome the most common complaints, the standards will kick in once the two main bus operators - SBS Transit and SMRT - get their new bus licences in 2 months.<br><br>PTC will then monitor these standards under actual operating conditions for half a year, tweaking them if necessary, by early next year, after which fines kick in for non-compliance.<br><br>These can go up to $100,000 per contravention.<br><br>"We can certainly strive and achieve continuous improvement and if each year, we can improve by a few percentage points, then, in time to come, it should reach a level not where no one will complain, but at least the majority of commuters will be satisfied with it," said PTC Chairman Gerard Ee.<br><br>The PTC says it will audit the performance standards measures submitted by the operators.<br><br>Singapore's two biggest bus operators, SBS Transit and SMRT, who'll be affected by the new service standards, say they welcome them.<br><br>In a statement, SBS Transit said the new standards will act as a goal post, spurring not just them, but the whole industry.<br><br>To meet the standards, SBS Transit says it will be stepping up efforts it has already made in the past few years, such as increasing the fleet and number of bus services, as well as revamping their website.<br><br>Meanwhile, SMRT says they've also been continually pursuing improvements, like adjusting schedule &amp; route to match demand, introducing new services as well as providing free services. - CNA /dt</div>

So.. you are trying to say is that it is better that SBST Take away all the NAC buses and drag the freq of buses to meet the standards of SMRTB and force ppl up their already crowded buses due to the fact that they do not have enough buses to go around. On your last point made. if SBST do not raise their fares for lets say 12years. Would they be able to combat the raising Fuel price ? Would they have the money to pay the BCs ? Would they have the money to maintain their bus fleets ? unless you are telling me that they are paying BCs like what they did 12years ago. Fuel price that is 12years ago. Then i would have agree with you that they should not have raise their bus fares. Think again.. Times have change.. We are now in the year 2006. Not 1994.. Think about what i have said.

Who do you think you are?  Don't be so self-delusional, you are a person of ZERO importance.<br><br>Seriously, how can the driver determine whether the buses has 100% loading or 97% loading or 95% loading.  Seriously, if the people want to squeeze onto the bus, what can the bus driver, ask them to get off?<br><br>And since you are so happy with the no 100% loading rule, I hope you SHUT up over the deployment of NAC buses.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where can atleast not nore than 95% full during peak hours? Not logical lah. The current bus system are good enough.<br>den wad safety?<br>wanna put seatbelts for passengers in city buses.<br>That will certainly make the bus even more packed and fare hike will go up even more. The PTC should think before they make their desicions lah.<br><br>imagine ah, BC shouting at passengers "get out from this bus, i dun wanna make my the bus more than 95% full" and blah blah blah a few days later get complain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

More likely, the bus stops would be packed, waiting for a bus with empty seats... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
