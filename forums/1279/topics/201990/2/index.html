            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Improving bus trips in the city</strong><br><br>Straits Times Review<br>29 July 2006<br><br>SOON enough, bus passengers can expect better service. Guidelines issued by the Public Transport Council, an independent body regulating bus services and public-transport fares, set 19 service standards that SBS Transit and SMRT Buses will need to meet - or face penalties. By six months from September, for instance, operators will have to ensure that peak-time buses are on average no more than 95 per cent full and 15 minutes apart. These are improvements that go to the heart of what passengers demand. Indeed, we are heartened by the fact that the Council's guidelines are based on customer feedback that capture actual travelling experience.<br>Nevertheless, there will be the inevitable gripe that the guidelines don't go far enough. This is natural. But would-be complainers must realise that the Council can't be expected to accommodate every demand. Two things bear keeping in mind when considering service improvements. The first is that bus operators are private companies, and are justifiably entitled to make reasonable profits for the service they provide. So there must be a sensible trade-off between what commuters want and what they are willing to pay. Service can always be improved by piling on excess capacity, but does this make financial sense to both commuters (who will have to shoulder the cost) and operators (who will have to manage a far larger infrastructure)? Related to this is point No. 2: Singapore is spread out into far-flung suburban neighbourhoods, rather than concentrated into a few compact centres. Much can be done with far less in crowded Hong Kong and New York. But, for example, connecting the interiors of every neighbourhood here with buses means huge outlays against what are likely to be small riderships. Geography dictates the nature of service.<br><br>And speaking of geography, a fair comparison for Singapore might be something like the vast landscape of greater Los Angeles. Now, consider how Singapore measures up. Certainly, things here can still be improved. But for this, commuters must appreciate the importance of focusing on what is possible. Our bottom line is that for the fares commuters pay, Singapore's bus - and train - services are probably as good as they can realistically get. Anything better will have to come at a price.<br><br></div>

It's the "Kiasuness" of Singaporeans to be blamed. Especially on high frequency routes, like 179 and 242, there will be severe bus bunching...<br>Generally this is the trend<br>At 6.00 a bus comes and starts loading passengers. Bus takes 2mins to load passengers that have queued up. Then probably another half or one minute for all the "Kiasu" people who run for the buses to board.<br>Then at 6.03, another bus comes. This bus only has to load "half a minute" of passengers. Then leaves relatively empty.<br>Then the cycle repeats itself.<br><br>An incident I saw this Friday at around 18.45, was that at the 242 queue, one bus was being loaded, while there were 2 other buses waiting behind to let passengers board! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> But the "Kiasu" people were still running to board the first bus! Making the first SD full to the door before being able to depart! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Then the SD and DD behind the first bus departed relatively empty.<br><br>It was obvious the 2nd and 3rd bus would have overtaken the 1st bus as it had less passengers to drop and the 1st bus was defintely delayed by the loading of the passengers!<br>So the ironic situation is that if the people would have reached their homes faster if they had waited patiently for the next bus. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

(In Hong Kong, its bus system error rate is as high as 70 per cent due to its hilly terrain).<br><br>It is also a hassle to call the hotline for a refund or to go to the nearest refund centre. It is not worth the effort, time and more money spent.<br><br>There should be a billing accuracy standard based on the Six Sigma methodology (which emphasises the application of statistical tools to critical business processes); or an error rate below 1 per cent.<br><br>Fine the bus operators if they do not meet it.<br><br>Let's keep things clean<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from graham mceune</span><br><br>I applaud the proactive steps taken by the PTC to improve the standard of service for Singapore's commuters. But I was surprised that no mention was made of cleanliness.<br><br>Compared to Singapore's taxis, which I rate the cleanest in the world, and the MRT and its stations Â— which, considering the volume of traffic, is excellent Â— some of the older buses appear unhygienic.<br><br>I understand the logistics: The hours buses spend on the road and the number of passengers carried, and so on. I also understand the business sense of running buses into the ground rather than buying new ones, as well as the fiscal benefits of skimping on nonessential maintenance.<br><br>But from whichever angle I look at it, I can see no reason for not at least keeping them clean.<br><br>Surely the cost of mopping the floors with an antibacterial wash, wiping over the seats and bell pushes and handrails, and cleaning the grease and grime from the windows once a week, would not make the bus companies that much poorer.<br><br>A bit of simple housework would greatly improve the travelling experience. The buses would smell fresher, dust mites would be less of an issue for allergic passengers (of which I am one), and the burgeoning cockroach problem would be banished.<br><br>There is also the unsightliness of posters stuck on the doors and windows. If they must be there, shouldn't they at least be affixed properly and with materials that don't yellow or peel off, leaving strips of Sellotape on the glass? I saw a poster recently for a competition that had ended six weeks before Â— evidence that SBS does not seem to keep a check on the insides of their buses, or if they do, then there is much that escapes their attention.<br><br>Pack 'em in Â– why not?<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from mahalingam laxman</span><br><br>I do not agree that buses should not take more than 95 per cent of maximum capacity, not when commuters are already complaining of the wait for buses.

            <div class='col-md body'>Improving bus services , safety, etc. total bullsh*t! You pay more for such f*cked up services.<br><br><span style="color: green;">The first incident:</span><br><br>My dad just had a fall 3 days ago and has hurt his shoulder blade. He can't even stretch his right arm fully and so on.<br><br>When he boarded the bus, the bus driver drove off without checking if all passengers or bus commuters are seated.<br><br>Then when my dad had a fall; he stopped the bus and went over to him and said 'are you ok? do you wanna see a doctor?' blah blah blah. (Hinting to him that he's willing to pay any medical fees. It wasn't a problem of money or compensation though.)<br><br>Then my dad retorted; 'If it was an elderly, who knows this lil' 'accident' might cost 'em their live.' As you know.. elderly's bones are fragile and stuff and breaking a bone is no joking matter.<br><br>And what about internal injuries? It might be a niggling internal injury rhat will never go off, and may most probably affect that person's lifestyle.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Another incident</span> involved my aunt's friend.<br><br>It  was raining, the ground is wet and slippery and when she boarded the bus, (at the steps) she slipped and fell. She knocked her head against the metal pole and the bus driver didn't even say or do anything.<br><br>He just stopped and waited for her to board the bus and then drove off.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Yet another incident</span> involved the bus service 17.<br><br>There was a long queue at the interchange and when the bus finally arrived; we had already waited for more than 40min. (arrival time: 18min)<br><br>Everyone was upset.<br><br>Some uncle went up to the bus driver and asked him 'how come you took so long to arrive?'<br><br>The bus driver took a glance at him and kept quiet. Sort of ignoring him, i say.<br><br>What good service standards. And speaking about being a gracious society...I beg to differ.<br><br>But of course; these are some of the black sheeps among the lot.</div>

They would rather dun sell these concession stamp and get those students to pay full adult fares. They will make more money instead.. S$52/month = S$1.73/day. What Aircon surcharge u wan to talk abt, when these students are paying only S$1.73/day for UNLIMITED TRIPS of BASIC BUS SERVICES?<br><br>Those student have the choice of not buying the concession stamp, if they feel that SBST is alway deploying NAC buses on SV74/151. They can choose not to buy concession stamp and pay cash or use Ezylink to pay instead, and thus they will only pay NAC fares if they board a NAC bus. But being smart students, they will still buy the stamp, as it is cheaper and it gives them unlimited daily rides.<br><br>And for the overloading, even if a bus is 75% full, it might alrd been overloading. Most buses allows 28 standing passengers only as far as i know. I believe our government are smarter than the insurance companies. They will surely ask SBST to buy those 3rd party insurance which cover everything from damages to buses or injuries to passengers , no matter whether it is overloading or not.<br><br>Also to meet the PTC rules of 95% loading, i think SBST will have more reason to ask for increment in fares if this rule is strictly enforced.
