There will always be 4 buses allowing boarding and alighting facilities just because that is the length in between 2 traffic lights! Sometimes there will be a serious jam and worse still, there was once when an accident occured at the junction of St 22 and Ave 3 (Common accident area) and the road jammed like mad!!! Waited quite a long time for my bus!!! Occured sometime during my Primary sch days.</div></blockquote>If I remember correctly, the bus stop you mentioned has bus bay. In my previous reply, I was referring to bus stop <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span> bus bay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well not that i want to flash it fast, but most of the times the bus drivers really couldn't be bothered to see it, and there are other people boarding the bus too, i mean if u got so many drivers who can't be bothered to see ur pass then u wld be used to flashing it fast<br><br>i admit that the passengers should sometimes think for the driver, but they could still ask politely.... so wat if they haf a bad day? that doesnt give them a right to humiliate others in front of so many people</div>
