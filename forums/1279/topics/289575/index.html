            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds the time i took Express 518 , those people who take the svc will agree with me the frequency is C.M.I<br><br>Took the bus on a saturday night waited 25mins @ Far East Plaza.. so by the time the bus reach Plaza Singapura. it almost reach the full passenger capacity..<br><br>The bus captain then communicated to someone over the walkie talkie which i believe should be the headquarter telling the person over walkie the bus is full already and that the Svc 518 needed an extra bus reinforcement. And apparently with the person over the walkie takie approval. He remove the signage for SVC 518 for the front and side and carrying on driving<br><br>While on the ECP i saw another SVC 518 behind the back which i believe is the reinforcement that was mention over the walkie talkie.. somehow rather i believe the reinforcement came too late coz the other bus was near empty except a few passengers... so you can imagine us in the crowded bus Svc 518 looking @ the near empty Svc 518...</div>
