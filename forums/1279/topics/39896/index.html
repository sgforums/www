It's either hot or cold.</div>

However, buses tend to be held back at roads with high loads. Just take a look at service 170, there's 50 buses on the fleet but the jam at causeway are always holding the buses back.</div>

The best way to solve this problem is to give them a feedback.<br>I am sure that the feeder service that used to go to Simei is 290 right? Right now, Svc 38 is overtaking Svc 290. This is quite 'bad' actually. </div></blockquote>Nope , bus 38 takes over the routes of 290 and 220 , the reason for this ?  because SBS can make more $$  . Passengers has to pay full fare instead of feeder service fare , you think about it .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">I think they need  to do some market and customer surveys.<br><br>For example, i use to take Bus 30 a few months  ago to my school in Pasir Panjang. I realise that when i go to school from Bedok Interchange at ard like 2pm, they use a air con double decker bus when the journey sees the bus rarely filled. Then when it was peak hour around 5 plus, i actually see at Pasir Panjang, 2 consecutive single deck bus coming in the space of 20 minutes.  It was FILLED to the BRIM!<br><br>So, if SBS had did some customer surveys. They would realise it is better for the customers to use a single deck at 2pm where passengers are fewer and double deck during peak.<br><br>Anyway, they say charge more increase service. Guess what? They change the feeder  bus route  at my flat in simei.  Now, I have to walk 10 minutes to get to the feeder bus stop instead of the usual 5 minutes. Better service? Darn right.</div></blockquote>Sometimes the way bus companies make amendments to services are to make free resources (i.e. buses) and make sure their profit margins won't fall. Furthermore, they would consider "alternative" services for passengers in the affect route, like walking to take other services.</div>

The reason you have given sounds logical.</div>
