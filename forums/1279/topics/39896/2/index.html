I complained of cockroaches in a bus and the bus was gone next day. It came back nice and clean with some fragrance. The only email that took longest to reply from TIBS took around 1 month.

The radio was on and tuning to Class 95. The rego was "TIB 495" if I did not remember wrongly. However, reception was kind of bad. I think the contract of trial with MediaCorp Radio has since expired and the radio on the buses are not being used anymore. This applies to some CSS buses with Power 98FM ad.<br><br><span class="small">Note: "Rego" here means "registration plate number".</span></div>
