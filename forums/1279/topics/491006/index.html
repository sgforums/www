              <p>Those air suspension buses should start without having to rev the engine so hard.BCs are the cause of it.The technical side should brief frequently to those newbie BCs.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Six passengers on an SMRT bus were hurt when the bus collided with a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) vehicle on Monday (Jan 11).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SAF vehicle was carrying a foldable longspan bridge when the accident occurred along Mandai Avenue. The foldable bridge is used to form a roadway for vehicles and troops to move over obstacles and gaps like riverbanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are in touch with the six injured passengers to provide assistance as best we can. The accident is currently under investigation by SMRT and the police,” said Mr Patrick Nathan, SMRT’s vice-president of corporate information and communications.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a media release issued early Tuesday, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) also said it is investigating the incident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Safety is the top priority for MINDEF and the SAF. Military vehicles follow the Land Transport Authority’s guidelines on public roads and travel on routes approved by the authorities,” it said.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>A driver and a passenger from the van were hurt in the accident and conveyed in a conscious state to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The driver, who is in his 40s, complained of numbness on his left arm while the female passenger, had swelling in the right side of her head, said SCDF. It added that an ambulance was dispatched to the location when it was alerted to the accident at about 4pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to an eyewitness who declined to be identified, the bus was blocking three lanes, two of which are turning lanes to Sembawang. He also said there was a huge impact when the bus ran across the divider.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accident involving 2 SMRT buses at Lentor Ave leaves 14 injured</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Fourteen passengers were hurt when an SMRT bus hit the back of another SMRT bus at a Lentor Avenue bus stop on Monday (Jan 25) afternoon.</p>
              <p>The impact was so strong that several passengers, many of whom were elderly, were tossed about in their seats.</p>
              <p>One even likened the sound of the impact to a bomb.</p>
              <p>The accident left shattered glass on the road and caused a 500m traffic jam in its wake.</p>
              <p>Debris from the collision could also be seen in the passenger area of the trailing bus.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said that the incident happened at the bus stop near Sungei Seletar in the direction of Yishun at about 2pm.</p>
              <p>The 14 passengers were taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in three ambulances, said a Singapore Civil Defence Force spokesman.</p>
              <p>The bus drivers were not injured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Six passengers said the bus in front, service 854, had suddenly jammed on its brakes after it left the bus stop.</p>
              <p>But the driver of the bus behind, service 858, failed to react in time and ploughed into the rear of bus service 854.</p>
              <p>The resulting crash sounded like “a big explosion”, said a 63-year-old passenger on bus service 854, who wanted to be known only as Madam Lim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THROWN</p>
              <p>She said: “All of a sudden, there was a loud bang. It felt like a bomb and the next thing I knew, I was thrown forward.</p>
              <p>“Thankfully, I wasn’t injured as I sat further in front. No one was standing (in the bus) at the time.”</p>
              <p>Mr Kok Nee Cheong, 70, a retiree who was seated behind Madam Lim, said a woman was trying to stop the bus just as it was moving off.</p>
              <p>“The driver saw her and suddenly stopped. If he had kept on going, this wouldn’t have happened,” said Mr Kok.</p>
              <p>He said the sudden jolt left him with pain on his left shoulder and kneecaps.</p>
              <p>The passengers immediately alighted. Some were angry and tried to find out the cause of the accident from the bus drivers.</p>

              involving 2 SMRT buses at Lentor Ave leaves 14

              <p> </p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Fourteen passengers were hurt when
              an SMRT bus hit the back of another SMRT bus at a Lentor Avenue bus
              stop on Monday (Jan 25) afternoon.</p>
              <p>The impact was so strong that several passengers, many of whom
              were elderly, were tossed about in their seats.</p>
              <p>One even likened the sound of the impact to a bomb.</p>
              <p>The accident left shattered glass on the road and caused a 500m
              traffic jam in its wake.</p>
              <p>Debris from the collision could also be seen in the passenger
              area of the trailing bus.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said that the incident happened at the bus
              stop near Sungei Seletar in the direction of Yishun at about
              2pm.</p>
              <p>The 14 passengers were taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in three
              ambulances, said a Singapore Civil Defence Force spokesman.</p>
              <p>The bus drivers were not injured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Six passengers said the bus in front, service 854, had suddenly
              jammed on its brakes after it left the bus stop.</p>
              <p>But the driver of the bus behind, service 858, failed to react
              in time and ploughed into the rear of bus service 854.</p>
              <p>The resulting crash sounded like “a big explosion”, said a
              63-year-old passenger on bus service 854, who wanted to be known
              only as Madam Lim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THROWN</p>
              <p>She said: “All of a sudden, there was a loud bang. It felt like
              a bomb and the next thing I knew, I was thrown forward.</p>
              <p>“Thankfully, I wasn’t injured as I sat further in front. No one
              was standing (in the bus) at the time.”</p>
              <p>Mr Kok Nee Cheong, 70, a retiree who was seated behind Madam
              Lim, said a woman was trying to stop the bus just as it was moving
              off.</p>
              <p>“The driver saw her and suddenly stopped. If he had kept on
              going, this wouldn’t have happened,” said Mr Kok.</p>
              <p>He said the sudden jolt left him with pain on his left shoulder
              and kneecaps.</p>
              <p>The passengers immediately alighted. Some were angry and tried
              to find out the cause of the accident from the bus drivers.</p>

              <p>See the road condition and the speed of the bus...</p>
              <p>- The road is wet at that time.. Even you can see it from the photo.</p>
              <p>- Svc 858 (SMB 1301 K) couldn't stop in time therefore the impact of the bus is greater... SMB 27 J i believe may just left the bus stop at the time of the accident...</p>
              <p>* Wanted to say that Mercedes Buses are better in durability than MAN buses... Coz made in Malaysia ah... (Jokes aside)</p>
              <p>Therefore, must see the scenario which bus travel at greater speed lorhx.</p>
