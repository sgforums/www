              <p>I'm a regular passenger of Service 52 during weekday mornings taking the bus to school from Bishan. I'd usually take the 6.05am bus which is done by an AMDEP duty.</p>
              <p>If anyone is also a frequent taker of Service 52 in the mornings, I'd assure you that your journey will ALWAYS be a pleasant one. The driver batch from AMDEP driving Service 52 is always so friendly, so polite, they greet you with a Good Morning everytime you board the bus. Let me highlight a few examples:</p>
              <p><strong>1) Perm lady BC of SBS 3878 R</strong><br>Quite young and "chio" lady, and what fits this most is her wide smile which never fails to start your day off. The moment you step into her bus you will see a smile on her face followed by a "Good Morning or Zao An (In Chinese)".</p>
              <p><strong>2) Perm male (middle-aged) BC of SBS 0334 M</strong><br>Enthusiastic driver; greets you with a loud "Good Morning" everytime you step into the bus. Once I was alighting at the bus stop outside my school and before I tapped my EZ-Link onto the exit reader came the familiar, enthusiastic voice. "Thank you, see you again! Bye!" How many times in a day can you get to hear that?</p>
              <p>Isn't that something worth taking Service 52 for? =)</p>
              <p>O.T.: The perm BC of 0333R drives the bus extremely fast. You should try it sometime. =D</p>
