For once, my bone did not creak from stress like the ordinary days. Compared to the VSO, the Leyland buses seem like an old grandfather! I guess it is the suspension, they smooth out the bumps on the road, and I almost fell asleep on the bus from the humming of the engine if not for the fact that I was so excited. And yes, I remember the bus number: SBS 9841 (forgot the last alphabet, but I think it's G)<br><br>So, is it true that SBS is replacing the Leylands with these awesome VSOs??</div></blockquote>Well, the registration number is indeed SBS 9841 G. For your info, Svc 133 has 3 of them, namely 9839, 9840 and the mentioned reg. number. These 3 musketeers are real cool! The mentioned Mercedes buses are Mercedes Benz O.405. Their bodyworks are of Duple Metsec (DM) and Alexander PS. DM bodies O.405 bodies are rather squarish, while the Alexander PS looks long and curvey.</div>
