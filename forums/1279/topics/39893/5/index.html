I really think that service 88 should not turn into Hougang Ave 4 &amp; 8, as that make the journey loner.<br><br>(I believe SBST let service 88 turns into Hougang Ave 4 &amp; 8 when it was first introduced because during that time (March 1999), Buangkok Green link to Sengkang and many roads in Sengkang have not exist yet, so no choice have to turn into Hougang in order to use Punggol Rd which is the only road during that time for entrance/exit into/from Sengkang.)<br></div>
