              <p>Well at least this uncle is doing his part to help passengers move into the bus so that people can board.</p>
              <p>Commuters still have this old habit of not moving to the back, especially after the recent introduction of LE (too high) and LF (too narrow) buses. Maybe it's time for both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses to trial 3 door buses, or have only 1 exit door placed at the end of the bus.</p>

              <p>Well i think whatever the uncle did was wrong although he was mad at the bus not stopping for them. He should not stand in the middle of the road to stop the bus. He should not disrupt the smooth operations of public transport services.</p>
              <p>He could have came out earlier or find an alternative route if he keeps facing the same problem each day.</p>

              <p>Then we have more people blocking buses after this? Where do you think you are, China or India? If the driver deems that the bus is full and no pax is able to board anymore, then so be it. Wait for the next bus or take the earlier bus or find an alternative route!</p>
              <p>What if the driver did not see him in the middle of the road and knock him down?</p>

              <p>Bro, I think you have never been out of Singapore, or have you? Here you get everything on your platter, still you want to criticize. Have you been to China, India or Philippines? Seen the public transport and issues there?? Then complain...</p>
              <p>In Singapore, you have everything. It is an efficient system, from the airport to MOM - everything is efficient. You have good cultural diversity - can find any type of food.</p>
              <p>The buses and train network is amazing. I would consider Singapore bus system as one of the best. The only competition could be London. It is much better than so many developed cities - Paris, Rome, Amsterdam. US don't even have a good public network.</p>
              <p>Go out and see, then complain. We are living in an ivory tower here, just that you don't realize... and want to keep whining and complaining!!! Drives me crazy how people just want to complain even though you have the best in the world.</p>

              <p>There are 101 reasons why he did that.</p>
              <p>he could have waited for the 3rd bus passing.</p>
              <p>he is really very late or work and maybe his supervisor has warned him about it that he might lose his job if he is late again.</p>
              <p>his salary could be deducted due to his lateness.</p>
              <p>if I was in the bus, I will not be pissed, I will be embarrassed. I am embarrassed by my fellow human beings including myself, we could have just moved in a bit more, squeezed in abit more so that someone could board the bus.</p>

              <p>Aiya..standard one lah. They are just trying to avoid the blame on the transport system and kept saying that it's world class transport only. Don't say the gahmen, even the school teachers also does that. Bus obviously late for schedule, seen student explaining and yet they still kenna blamed.Â <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i missed a few buses at one shot before, i know that feeling... but what do you want SMRT to do? add one bus just for them? there are many commuters from other services that are also affected too. he should not have gone out and stop the bus in the middle of the road no matter what.</p>

              <p>this SMRT and SBS are making tonnes of money! Maybe they should employ a enforcer standby at busy bus stop, inspect that the bus is really full, if not full, his jobis to go up the bus and tell pax move behind??</p>
