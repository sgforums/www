              <p>It has been ages that some services have been discussed. For example, take 143, no service improvement, no bus add, no bus upgrade, all good - this service has been forgotten by forumers.</p>
              <p>Or similarly take service 5, 14, 21 etc etc - no one talks about these services anymore.</p>
              <p>I miss my days when I was a regular commuter on 143 as my workplace was on Pasir Panjang and I used to love how 10, 30, 51 and 143 would form a DD train at Haw Par Villa at particular time slots during the day.</p>

              <p><br>147 has a regular bunching problem AM peak. PM peak is still okay. Frequency is very good and with 147A in AM - you can spot regularly at Bendemeer/Potong Pasir 3 DDs together. I have highlighted this many many times. It is a waste of precious resources because first bus is packed, next one is mediocre and third goes empty.</p>

              <p>Again, I believe misunderstanding is inevitable. </p>
              <p>So lemme explain myself. </p>
              <p>By the definition of "in this case" I refer to the bunching of 5 in the morning. The bunching itself won't cause problems. What WILL cause trouble is when the buses run off schedule. Too early and ppl will miss the bus. Too late and the ppl won't reach the place in time. Either way you end up LATE. Which isn't good, of course!</p>
              <p>And just to tell you, bunching is the AFTERMATH of off-schedule. User SBS3004X came in to say 147 bunching, while not telling me the time of the incident and not telling me the reasons (it may be due to jams in Chinatown, but I emphasise again 5 off-schedule is in EARLY MORNING towards city from the east, so most trips are just started from PSR one, ruling out traffic conditions as jams won't be expected and traffic lights are but a lame excuse as other svcs which ply the similar amount of traffic lights don't have this problem, an example being 156), and so I assume he's adding on to the aftermath, aka the bunching. So I just say "no! Bunching in this case of off schedule operation is not the problem (for all I care if buses come together, compared to getting to work late due to BCs not adhering to schedule, it's nothing). It is buses come early and then late that is the problem." </p>
              <p>I repeat again, NEVER had I ONCE said 147 bunching is not a big problem. At least my intentions are so. If you have comprehended it in a way I have not make it out to be, now is the explanation you will so require. </p>
              <p>And are you sure 5 bunch up is "extremely rare"? Please get your facts right. This aftermath does happen sometimes, and usually it's two DDs that's in the picture, I repeat, DDs. It is NOT "extremely rare", Mr BusAnalayzer. I mean, how often do you actually observe the svcs in the east? </p>
              <p>To allow you to give clearly false facts on the condition of trip operations of svcs in the east end? </p>
              <p>I mean, is this how you live up to your username? That's quite a laughable thought, so I hope you don't. </p>
              <p>Amazing ah!</p>

              <p><br>Well the initial part of your post was okay, where you were trying to explain yourself and understood. Though you did tell 3004X that 147 bunching is not really a problem. If you forget what you type, go and read - it is a few posts on the same page.</p>
              <p>Next, if you want to start criticizing me, let me remind you some of the most weird statements you have made</p>
              <p>1. 854 is better than 25 because it is faster (how? because it skips stops and overtakes 25 ahead)</p>
              <p>2. 969 reaches WDL faster than 168 from Tampines, because bendies are faster than DDs</p>
              <p>3. Bendies are better than DDs because of speed</p>
              <p>** You stopped your speed saga once the SMRT bus over turned and then you got lot of flak. Mr, I do have a good memory**</p>
              <p>4. Crib about 27 bunching all the time, in spite of it having a superb frequency. Now, nor SBST nor SMRT can do anything, since the terminal is underground and cannot accommodate DDs. It is like you saying "cut off a bridge so that 27 can ply DDs". Yes, there are alternatives like 27A that can be made full day from Tampines with DDs.</p>
              <p>5. 159 route should not be modified because people travel all the way from Sengkang to Toa Payoh and it is the fastest route. How on earth can a route that goes merry go round via Lor Chuan and Bradell to Toa Payoh be the fastest route? I ignored.</p>
              <p>Countless examples where you just shoot your mouth out... So next time, before criticizing someone, think twice.</p>

              <p><br>Actually 59 has got a lot of improvements now. First, it was fleet of 5 DDs, 13 SDs... now fleet of 10 DDs, 9 SDs.... Already one BSEP bus added... 5 DDs added to the service... I agree it has high load... and accordingly SBST/LTA has given it improvements. Sometimes because of traffic... frequency can get erratic..</p>
