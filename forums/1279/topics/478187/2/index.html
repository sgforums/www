              <p><br>147 - the BCs need to be told not to tail each other... This is something I have observed regularly on 147... 3 DDs go back to back... one DD can overtake and go ahead and take few more pax... but no... will wait behind the other two DDs taking no pax on board while the first bus goes housefull..</p>
              <p>This is some attitude training that 147 BCs need. I also got so irritated once with a 147 BC. There were 2 147s ahead at the Bendemeer/Macpherson junction towards Clementi. This BC drove the bus fast and took it in amber tailing the other 2 buses. At that junction, he could have just waited. It is quite a big signal of 2 mins... and that would have got the bus some pax in the next stops... He ran the DD with just 10-12 pax on board.</p>

              <p><br> Well the initial part of your post was okay, where you were trying
                      to explain yourself and understood. Though you did tell 3004X that
                      147 bunching is not really a problem. If you forget what you type,
                      go and read - it is a few posts on the same page.</p>
              <p>Next, if you want to start criticizing me, let me remind you
                      some of the most weird statements you have made</p>
              <p>1. 854 is better than 25 because it is faster (how? because it
                      skips stops and overtakes 25 ahead)</p>
              <p>2. 969 reaches WDL faster than 168 from Tampines, because
                      bendies are faster than DDs</p>
              <p>3. Bendies are better than DDs because of speed</p>
              <p>** You stopped your speed saga once the SMRT bus over turned and
                      then you got lot of flak. Mr, I do have a good memory**</p>
              <p>4. Crib about 27 bunching all the time, in spite of it having a
                      superb frequency. Now, nor SBST nor SMRT can do anything, since the
                      terminal is underground and cannot accommodate DDs. It is like you
                      saying "cut off a bridge so that 27 can ply DDs". Yes, there are
                      alternatives like 27A that can be made full day from Tampines with
                      DDs.</p>
              <p>5. 159 route should not be modified because people travel all
                      the way from Sengkang to Toa Payoh and it is the fastest route. How
                      on earth can a route that goes merry go round via Lor Chuan and
                      Bradell to Toa Payoh be the fastest route? I ignored.</p>
              <p>Countless examples where you just shoot your mouth out... So
                      next time, before criticizing someone, think twice.</p>

              <p>I have found evidence myself (EDIT). Guess what? Your memory has proven to be a fail. I'm sorry. I have NOT said with my own words that 854 &gt; 25 in speed. And as for 969 &gt; 168, I did not say 969 reach WDL faster than 168 from Tampines. I only said 969 buses travel faster on expressway faster than 161/168, and it's NOT becoz of bendies, BUT becoz of the crazy SMRT BCs which always causes buses to be off schedule. I only compared 969 to 39 from IKEA onwards to Yishun. FAIR ENOUGH? And so did I say bendies are faster than DDs? NO, unless you find the evidence lor... <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">The others I duly accept, though for 4 I do hope you can try observing it at SATS kitchen and Blk 938 during PM peak.</span></p>
              <p>And thanks for understanding my words. At least that's one comforting fact, I guess?</p>

              <p>Even with more buses added mostly are moving towards during evening peak hour tampines not other round. even from toa payoh to east I can see more 59 buses from east to bishan than bishan to east in the morning. to solve the jaming problem full day bus lane alone changi to tampine should be draw. And also semi-express bus service should like those buses in YOG travel in so call bus lane and others have to give way to them during peak hours. </p>

              <p><br>13 has 7 DDs out of which 2 serve 13A and 2 crossover to 548 during AM peak. That leaves with only 4 DDs doing the whole route. Yet I somehow believe SDs take the loading on 13 pretty well.. and not very often the loading crosses 70 pax. It mostly ranges around 60-65 pax. Don't know if you have a different observation.</p>
