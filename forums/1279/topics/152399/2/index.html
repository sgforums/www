There are rich people who use the buses too.  It's just a matter of preference and convenience.  And do you know what are buses?  Buses are public transportation.  Which means, rich or poor, fat or thin, black or white, immature or mature, silly or clever all can use the public transport.  Can you have some common sense if you don't ave any common dollar!<br><br></div></blockquote>Sorry I have some misconception on that. All people can sit the public transport regardless they are rich or poor as they are people's transport.

I had difficulty comprehending the last part of your statement (perhaps due to your english), whereby you stated "could save time but the prices can be set lower".  What do you mean by this? You meant ffw107 fares should be set cheaper than the rest of fast forward services? Doesn't sound very practical &amp; realistic to me.<br><br>Furthermore, I feel that there is a better way of utilising the buses instead of putting potential buses on "ffw107" as personally, I dont feel that the demand is so solid. Hence, I am not very supportive of the introduction of ffw107.<br><br>I think most of us here know what is your actual motive of suggesting ffw107:- Due to your overwhelming passion for service 107. However, please consider other factors and be more meticulous when you make a statement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
