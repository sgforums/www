Regulations state that demo vehicles can only stay for 1 year, after which it must be bought or re-exported. SBS later decided to buy the Lynx. Hence, it wasn't re-exported like the Leyland Leopard and the Leyland National 2. Unfortunately, there were no further orders for the Lynx.<br><br>SBS3572Y is unique as it is the only Lynx to be found in the region. The Lynx was originally intended for the British market as the successor of the Leyland National 2. It has already served its time on revenue service in the 1990s, having been deployed on svs. 106, 267 and 269 to name a few. I don't feel that SBST would like to put it back into revenue service because it is nearing its retirement age, having been registered in 1989. There's no aircon, no farebox and no cardreader. Sad but true, it is slowly rusting away inside Ang Mo Kio Depot.<br><br></div>

Heavens, no! The MAN 16.240 was registered as SBS 81S in 1990. Why would SBS scrap it when it was only 9 years old? Anyway, I've got pictures of it taken in 2003 and the last time I saw it was only a year ago. It was even re-painted in SBST colours. I'm sure it is still used as a training bus and kept inside Ang Mo Kio Depot (I think).<br><br>SBS 81S was put on 76. I don't know about other services but I think someone had spotted it doing 61 (or was it 106?) as well.</div>
