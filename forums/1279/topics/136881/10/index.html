He mentioned that there were two buses park there during the 30 mins period. So during this period, no SV170 arrive at the terminal right? So there might be traffic jam at the causeway and the two buses might have been caught at the jam earlier for several hours. Thus need to let the engine cool down and let the driver rest first.</div>

In short, it's not your lucky day lah. I was surprised that you waited for 30 minutes plus. I mean, 170 is not like 401 or 405.</div>
