            <div class='col-md body'>The traffic jam is not at the Queen St Ter but at the Causeway. Since most of the buses are stuck at the Causeway Jam of course there aren't many left at the Queen St end, hence the long waiting time (waiting for the next bus to reach Queen St).

I'd understand if there weren't any buses there and they had to wait till a bus pulled in, then they are so far behind schedule they had to change drivers immediately and move off, or something.<br><br>But when the stated waiting time is 8 ~ 12 mins and the busses sit there for more than 30 mins???<br><br>Even if there were no buses there, with all the raise in transport fares... put more buses on the road?!<br><br>If they can't do that, then state more realistic waiting times on their fliers.  Then maybe the transport minister in his ivory castle can see a little bit of reality.   Then maybe all of those multi-million dollar ministers we have can no longer pertend that things are fine and allow all these transport costs to go up with the excuse that we have "world-class" services and all that crap.</div>
