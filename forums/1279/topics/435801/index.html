              <p>133M operates only during evening hours during weekends.</p>
              <p>70M &amp; 162M is needed. I don't see why must 70M and 162M be converted to full day service.</p>
              <p>163M only operates in the early morning and nearly before midnight.</p>
              <p>170 (Blue) is needed to relieve loads.</p>
              <p>182 needs time to go between Tuas South and Jurong West Estate via Tuas Checkpoint. Without it plying there, I think the waiting time will be shorter.</p>
              <p>284M I think it can replace 284 already.</p>
              <p>853 it is also good to go Upp East Coast at all times.</p>
              <p>Why 115 is not needed? It can bring passengers to the hawker centres at Hougang St 21 and take them back without having to cross the roads.</p>
              <p>131 and 275 looks like duplicating, but someone refused to withdraw 275 due to their frequency difference.</p>
              <p>529 can be replaced by 825 with 529's operating times becoming a part of 825's operating times.</p>
              <p>925C I think it could be extended to either Lim Chu Kang or Choa Chu Kang Cemetries.</p>

              <p>think about it. the only reason why a route runs parallel to another route is to compliment the demand and achieve better frequency.</p>

              <p><br>Eh</p>
              <p>There's no pt for all 170 to do full route.</p>
              <p>There's some time slot that 170X's appearance is needed during off peak, henceforth might as well operate the full day.</p>
              <p>Then at night, M'sian pax are simply lazy to cross the bridge to take bus.</p>
              <p>1-2 mins? Seriously, at this rate lots of buses are only going to get stucked at the CIQ.</p>
              <p>CW2's freq isn't good to begin with, during low demand hrs freq is 35 mins a bus.</p>

              <p>133M operates only during evening hours during weekends.</p>
              <p>70M &amp; 162M is needed. I don't see why must 70M and 162M be converted to full day service.</p>
              <p>163M only operates in the early morning and nearly before midnight.</p>
              <p>170 (Blue) is needed to relieve loads.</p>
              <p>182 needs time to go between Tuas South and Jurong West Estate via Tuas Checkpoint. Without it plying there, I think the waiting time will be shorter.</p>
              <p>284M I think it can replace 284 already.</p>
              <p>853 it is also good to go Upp East Coast at all times.</p>
              <p>Why 115 is not needed? It can bring passengers to the hawker centres at Hougang St 21 and take them back without having to cross the roads.</p>
              <p>131 and 275 looks like duplicating, but someone refused to withdraw 275 due to their frequency difference.</p>
              <p>529 can be replaced by 825 with 529's operating times becoming a part of 825's operating times.</p>
              <p>925C I think it could be extended to either Lim Chu Kang or Choa Chu Kang Cemetries.</p>

              <p>Cos 170X now allows boarding Os Kranji. Few takers would cross the bridge these days.</p>
              <p>Ever saw a packed 170X into CIQ from Kranji while a 160 tat arrived prior to that has only 4 passengers onboard.</p>
              <p>In any case for 170 it's pretty epic. 13 mins is pretty ok as travelling pattern has really changed ever since the JB CIQ shifted.</p>
              <p>925 I believe the take was because in the past, not many ppl would access tat place for it's mostly concrete and timber industries. I believe it has changed for there are dorms and furniture showrooms.</p>
