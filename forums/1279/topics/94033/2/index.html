Oh, and i forgot to mention...even Hougang Central interchange is actually due for reconstruction as an underground interchange interchange aka Sengkang and Toa Payoh too!<br><br>Also, they do amend their plans sometimes, I have noticed. For example, Yishun's Interchange was initially zoned for redevelopment back in 1996 when the earlier plans were out, but I notice they have changed their minds since the 1998 Master Plan?</div>

After that they changed e bulbs in e wall lamps fm warm white to day light lightings. At least is a little brighter nw, but still not bright enough. Furthermore they did not even changed e bulbs in all e wall lamps. If u go there now, u can c 4 different colours of lights on e wall, 1) warm white, 2) cool white, 3) day light n 4) no light. (out of order). They even said that they will monitor e interchange closely, n increase e lightings when necessary. Wt a joke?!?
