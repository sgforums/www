              <p>kinda reminds me of the time i was in KL, standing on the pavement, waiting for the traffic lights to change and almost got wiped out by a public bus...</p>
              <p>mind you.. i was standing ON the raised pavement.. the bus went up the kerb when making a turn... luckily i was alert enough to jump out of the way into the five-foot way</p>
              <p>and all that being said, the bus people here, see that this lady was not stalking buses, not running into the middle of the road trying to take a picture of some bus, just minding her own business, crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing and she got hit and killed... so don't leap into the street with a camera trying to take pictures of buses.. there might be one which didn't see you and wipe you out.. just like i almost wiped out one with my car who ran into the middle of the road into my path to take a picture of a bus</p>
              <p>we laugh at you all but we don't want you smeared on the road by the object of your obsession...</p>

              <p><strong>SBS Transit to pay for funeral expenses of Sengkang bus accident victim</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: SBS Transit said it wanted to pay for all funeral 
              expenses, including repatriation costs, incurred by the family of a 
              Malaysian who died in a bus accident in Sengkang on Tuesday.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Chan Ah Yong, 66, died at the scene after she was hit by an SBS Transit bus while crossing the road.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SBS Transit's senior
               vice president for corporate communications, Tammy Tan, said the 
              company spoke to Mdm Chan's son-in-law on Wednesday and wanted to tell 
              him that it is footing the bill.<br><br>However, before SBS Transit could convey the offer, Mdm Chan's son-in-law told the company to call him again next week.<br><br>SBS
               Transit said it respected his request and said no more as it did not 
              want to impose on the family during their time of grief.<br><br>However,
               some media reports gave the impression that the family may have a 
              mistaken impression that SBS Transit is still undecided on whether to 
              pay for the funeral costs. <br><br>SBS Transit has decided to clear the 
              air on the issue, to ensure that the family does not have this matter 
              weighing further on their minds.<br><br>The company has since contacted 
              Mdm Chan's son-in-law again to inform him that all costs related to the 
              funeral will be borne by the bus operator.<br><br>SBS Transit also told him that he can contact the company anytime for assistance.<br><br>The company said it is deeply saddened by this accident and is doing all it can to help the family during this difficult time.<br><br>"We
               know nothing we do or say can change the fact that a life has been lost
               and a family is in grief. We can only say we are very, very sorry and 
              will do whatever we can to assist the family during this difficult 
              time," Ms Tan said. <br><br>- CNA/wm</span></span></p>

              <p>Even it is (during the December 2011 MRT disruptions), that's because of the tracks which are not manufactured in China (if I'm not wrong).</p>

              <p>So I think now sgporeans can see better how people in china drive. Don't play play, motorbikes and pedestrians are nothing on their roads. Even in sg, watch out when you cross the roads. All it takes is just one drunk driver or siao kao. Go youtube and type in "china accidents" and you can see plenty of such behaviour. Beating traffic lights, hit-and-run etc is normal there.</p>
              <p>By right, they shouldn't even demand such miserly compensation. Funeral and a flight to sabah? Should sue them and make this a national issue.</p>
