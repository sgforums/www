              i always make it a point to cross the road only if the oncoming vehicle has stopped or is stopping.
              
              i see a lot of people just crossing without checking the oncoming traffic just because the green man is on or when they are using the zebra crossing. dont assume all vehicles will stop!!!

              its the same.  if i feel the oncoming vehicle is not slowing down i wont cross.  even cyclist nowadays are damn reckless, let alone motorists.

              nearly half a minute, was pronounced dead on the spot in a horrific
              traffic accident that occurred at 11.20am on Tuesday.</p>

              Service 159, which was making a right turn at the junction. The
              woman was then dragged for about half a minute more under the bus
              before other motorists alerted the bus driver.</p>

              tragedy. IT technician Mr Terence Lim, 31, recalled the sounds made
              by the woman's body as it was dragged under the bus. 'It all
              happened so quickly, I didn't even hear her scream,' he said.</p>

              <p><strong>Daughters request for SBS to pay for transportation of body</strong></p>
              <p>The daughters of a 66-year-old woman who died after being hit by a SBS bus in Sengkang on Tuesday have requested for SBS Transit to pay the bill for transporting her body to Malaysia for the funeral.</p>
              <p>However, SBS Transit has asked Kenix Lau, 33, the younger daughter of the deceased Chan Ah Yong, to submit a proposal to their management. The company could not be contacted on Wednesday for an update on the family's request, according to the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Chan’s funeral will take place in Seremban in Malaysia, where her husband and two sons live, ST reported.</p>
              <p>Chan, a Malaysian on a long-term visit pass here, had stayed at her daughter’s flat in Block 232 flat for nearly three years.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday morning, Chan was involved in a fatal accident while crossing the road at the junction of Sengkang East Way and Compassvale Road.</p>
              <p>She was just 350m away from her daughter’s flat in Block 232 when she was hit by a SBS bus 159, which was making a right turn at the junction.</p>
              <p>The elderly woman was dragged under the bus for about half a minute before the bus driver stopped the bus after being alerted by other motorists. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
              <p>A 14-second Youtube video, taken from a car in the area of the accident,  had garnered over 300 views as of Wednesday morning. It has since been removed from the site.</p>
              <p>A resident from a HDB estate nearby said that after the accident, the bus driver was seen on the phone and shouted at the passengers to leave the bus.</p>
              <p>The bus driver involved in the accident has been suspended from work and is assisting the police with investigations, ST reported.</p>
