            <div class='col-md body'>HK bus drivers are among the best i believe due to their ability to maneuver their buses well n drive tight corners. Try takin 260 or 66 to Stanley from central or 15to Peak n c wat i mean. The tightest of corners coupled with speed can give u a thrilling ride[nt to mention the 10.3m buses have 3 axles for great maneuverability].</div>
