I wonder why SBST can't spread out the VSOs.<br><br></div></blockquote>I believe you have taken service 168 during peak hours from Bedok towards Woodlands.<br><br>I must say that the loads on the DDs are high and there's no way a SD can afford to carry that number of passengers at the given headway, unless SBST deploys 2 buses at a time.<br><br>Let me quote what you just said, "the direction to Bedok are mostly single deckers and they are packed to the front". This I agree, but, I believe this is considered "able to cope with loads" as many passengers are able to squeeze into the bus.<br><br>Again, if no one notices, the headway from WDL towards Bedok is almost half the headway from Bedok towards WDL. Headways from WDL can be as fast as 6 to 8 minutes per bus, while headways from Bedok are still between 12 to 15 mins. This will make up the "loss" of deploying SDs.<br><br>The brunching of VSOs can be real irritating, but that's when the buses are needed. There must be a reason of brunching of the VSOs, I do not know the exact reason, but definitely there MUST be a reason.<br><br>Besides, there will always be VOs on the opposite directions of the VSOs.<br><br>This could also be the reason service 39 is made to serve Jalan Kayu.</div>

Even my moderators do not alter the other user's posts at whim, unlike you.<br><br>You say you do not care whether Sv. 168 gets VOs, LOs or whatnot.

If my attitude is deplorable, so is yours. The treatment you gave other forum users (I don't think I need to say more) speaks more volumes about your attitude than mine.
