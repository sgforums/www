                  <p>The writer states that the bendy (This time its TIB989E cameo 190) swung dangerously from lane 1 to the next and back again hence passengers experiences high G-forces at the rear.</p>
                  <p>I experienced this before while at the rear tho, when the SL suddenly shift from lane to lane at high speed. Anyone experiences this before?</p>

              <p>Yes, its not rare to experience high forces when the bus swtiches lane quickly...</p>
              <p>And one or more times, on service 190, numerous of buses like 878S (now WLDEP), 1118X (when it went to 'ji siao' s190), some of the perm buses Habit especially and those which seems not to have 'bang-you' (lock at 60km/h) and even 1224Y, when the bus captain switches lanes quickly, at Lornie Road exit area as well, the slope and the added velocity will create a very big sway at the rear, causing the passengers, mostly at the last row, feel a very strong sideways jerking force.</p>
              <p>Even on normal roads this will occur.</p>
              <p>I would say that its the natural design of the bus that creates such huge forces, as the rear carriage is like a tail, a crocrodile's tail is very power and so does the bus' 'tail' in such a sense, sway very hard when the front changes direction.</p>
              <p>It is technically so that the rear axle will follow the same route as the middle axle, so by 'keeping up', the axle is subjected high forces and so does the force goes up to the cabin, and on a whole, as the fulcrum is on the middle axle, the rear will become the 'load'. When u subject high forces to the applied area, the fulcrum is the turing point, where its the most stable (the middle axle) and the load is where the turn is similar, if not the same, as ur applied point. So does the bendy bus work in such a way.</p>
              <p>When the bus jack-knives, just like in Harbourfront and many other places, the feeling that u would have at the rear is how u would feel in the front, but when at the middle axle, u only feel a small bump, if none...</p>

              <p>Under normal driving conditions, an articulated bus should in no way jack-knife whilst travelling in a straight line.  Jack-knifing or fish-tailing is generally caused by poor maintenance.</p>
              <p>Regarding the "bus may swing outwards" signs: these were displayed on articulated buses fitted with steerable rear axles.  Rear-steer articulated buses have two steering axles - frontmost and rearmost.  When the front axle is turned to the left (e.g. for a left-hand turn), the rear axle turns slighly to the right.  This moves the trailer away from the nearside kerb, thereby giving a tighter turning radius at the expense of off-side "swing-out".  A larger problem occurs when there is street furniture sited close to the kerb in a bus bay.  Potentially, a rear-steer articulated bus' nearside rear corner may come into contact with this furniture upon departure from the bus bay due to the "swing-out".  With the steering wheel at full lock in either direction, the "swing-out" clearance required is significant, which means that special training is required to drive these vehicles.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p>Ok, the bus is on the extreme left lane, where it should be. It was presumably over taking other slower vehicle in an abrupt manner. Passengers in the Bendy, especialy those at the rear, exprienced some (terrific) G-force.</p>
              <p>Isn't the G-force thing normal. It is centrifugal force, you can experience it even in cars, and regular buses. <em>Tiko</em> uncles and other miscreants, take advantage of it when they are seated next to a <em>chio bu.</em></p>
              <p>I will put it down to bad driving by the bus captain rather than faulty design of the Bendy.</p>

              <p>cos of length, attachment body factor and finally, travelling speed</p>
              <p>oftenly SMRT buses love to do abrupt lane changing one... somemore keep on acclerating for any occasion (reversing at bus int, travelling at 40kph at bus int @ Boon Lay &amp; Ang Mo Kio)... I hope not, sooner or later one bendy bus going to crash into bus interchange platform all cos of carelessness + speeding</p>
