              Although the B10TLs and Tridents in Hong Kong are wheelchair
              accessible, at that period of time, Singapore's B10TLs and Tridents
              are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only configured as
              low-floor easy accessibility buses</span> like the B10BLEs and
              L94UB as part of the modernisation of its fleet in 2000-2004. To
              install a wheelchair accessible ramp to current low-floor
              buses is probably not as simple as you think. From my
              observations the ramp is integrated with the bodywork of the bus
              before it goes into service. To install a ramp means to modify
              the exit heavily, add the manual ramp and hope that
              the modification does not break. I also had thought about why
              SBST had not thought about converting all their low-floor buses to
              WAB too.</p>

              <p>thank you for your rudeness. i aplogise for misreading. converting a non wab to wab still requires purchase. you said no need to buy anything. there needs to be changes in the interior. its not as easy as put a wheel chair backrest dump a ramp, remove railings and install railings. there needs to be inspection on changes made to the bodywork interior itself. bef this can happen and again it isnt like you wanna do you can do, you still have to wait for lta approval and safety must be upon installing such functions and such things dun come easy.</p>
              <p>it is easy to talk. i can say cng also should convert so easy. dump a backrest remove the railing at the exit door and dump a ramp. if its so easy, sbst would have installed it? O.o</p>

              <p>i see. i hope that if they would want to do smth like that, that they first try it out and once the necessaries are solved that they should begin installing immediately and not procrastinate further so as to fully utilize the bus.</p>

              <p><br>Refer to my post in the previous page about SBST buying these low-floor buses as only low floor easy accessibility buses.</p>
              <p>But to convert about say, 70 buses [Dennis Trident - 20 Buses, VSO, 50 buses excluding 9889U) vs they bringing in close to 1100 WAB buses [delieveries for K230UB Euro V ongoing] already, not much point for them to convert the 70 buses also.......More likely when the LO goes off there'll be new WAB demos or something.</p>
