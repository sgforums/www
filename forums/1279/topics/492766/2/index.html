              <p><br> you're right. 156 loading is not that low BusAnalayzer claimed.
              Buses can be packed along Boundary Rd to Bishan Stn. There is also
              loading from Bishan to Thomson.</p>

              <p>Okay fine - didn't say it does not have people boarding 156. The current fleet manages the current load quite nicely. It is not a packed-to-door kind of service. Some timings may fetch around 50-55 pax, most will be around 20-30 pax.</p>
              <p>Hence, there is no need for any fleet add. Just as a reminder, even 156A was withdrawn, which is quite rare to happen during the BSEP fleet add scenario. It is done because the loading over the years has significantly dropped on 156 (and more so after sv 50 was launched). </p>

              <p>I have already said many times, 852 has great potential, it provides foundation for DTL2 rationalisation... So that svcs like 67 and 157 could fly BKT Rd... And surplus buses could boost 852 currently unappealing freq</p>

              <p>I agree with your point, however 852 is still needed to lessen the loading on 74. Esp Ard late afernoon to end of PM peak where the Bt Timah stretch is filling the buses even though there is DTL now. Lesser people board to Marymount due to DTL-CCL, but people are taking 852 to further up like YCK where 851 only duplicates from Marymount.</p>

              <p>Maybe once TEL is up and running may need to boost 141 but as of now doing okay. Buses have around 30-45 pax between Caldecott and Toa Payoh at most peak hour timings. So not sure if there is need to add bus when loading throughout is just so-so.</p>
              <p>235 got around 3-4 fleet add so the frequency is pretty good and connects most part of Toa Payoh town with direct connection to Caldecott MRT. </p>

              <p>64 not so bad... Frequency is actually 12-14 mins... But yes the

              <p>Agreed,I chit chat with my former Hgdep BC friend also say the same thing..And 64 till now cannot use full DDs..Loadings has since dropped.</p>

              <p>there are many people taking 235 during peak hours. 235 is taking too long to reach toa payoh hub one long loop. 141 provide a shorter router to toa payoh hub. the timing of 141 during is very bad 15-18 min during peak hours. maybe there is traffic jam but if LTA can have a 141M or put in rerouted 231 which is more direct to the toa payoh hub will be better.</p>
              <p>I think maybe get another trunk service like 143, 139 or 145 to passby the Caldecott. 156 or 153 is the idea case. New TM MRT line 2020? and new hdb flats coming in 2017 i think there will be high demand for 235 and 141</p>
