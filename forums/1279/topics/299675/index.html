            <div class='col-md body'>My thoughts:<br><br><strong>Most Memorable Event</strong><br><br>Withdrawal of CSS 608, which eventually led to the withdrawal of City Shuttle Services. I regretted not having pictures of such buses in service, but I got something else from BC of CSS 0186L (second last bus to depart from Bedok Interchange) - an ang pow. I still have it kept in my room though.<br><br>I was also the first witness of CSS 0195K departing from Bedok at about 1933 hrs - barely a few minutes after a Service 26 bus (SBS 0420Y) and a Service 32 bus (SBS 2803M) got into an accident. SBS 2803M was unscathed - I saw this bus on Express 518 a few days later and there was no damage. SBS 0420Y suffered damage to it's windscreen and the front cover dropped off.<br><br>I'm sure that this event is something most of you would remember.<br><br><strong>Most Memorable Redeployments</strong><br><br>I cannot think of a good one - there were simply too many major redeployments. But I can still remember the crazy Scania NAC cameos on BNDEP feeder and selected trunk services. Of course these buses came from BRBP - mostly from Services 90 and 94. At around that time, it was how SBS 3619Y became to be one of my favourite buses.<br><br>Another one: LO3X appears in BBDEP and ARBP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Can't imagine hordes of bus fans going around every part of Singapore to catch photos of all four LOs in action. First LO that I spotted (from BBDEP/ARBP) is SBS 9019P on 65.<br><br><strong>Most Memorable Cameos</strong><br><br>SBS 8018Z on Service 58! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I was originally able to go and catch this cameo, however, my parents refused to let me go. In the end, I was upset about not having the photo while others have them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
