              <p>During the recent budget debate, Transport Minister Raymond Lim told
              parliament that the approach to centralised bus planning is to '
              identify any gaps in connectivity and try to plug them'.<br> <br> Some of these gaps include cutting back on complicated routes to ensure that the services run more efficiently.<br> <br> What are some of the potential pitfalls that can be avoided, as details
              of the centralised bus planning ' blueprint ' are being worked out?<br> <br> <em>Lin Jiamei</em> finds out.<br> <br> The idea is to avoid a radical ' big bang ' approach with major changes
              to the bus system that will confuse and in turn put off many commuters.<br> <br> Take Seoul for instance , a landmark reform of its public bus system
              was carried out in 2004 when many major changes were introduced.<br> <br> -- one of which was the change in bus routes and numbers, overnight.<br> <br> Professor Kim Kwang Sik from Sungkyunkwan University was involved in the planning of the Seoul Bus Reform.<br> <br> He admits that the situation was ' very bad ' within the first week of implementation.<br> <br> "For instance the blue bus, it has three digits, 1-0-1, means from zone
              1 to zone 0 and bus number 1. In my case, if I used bus 56, from 1 July
              2004, overnight, it became 101, completely changed. So although we
              advertised the changes in bus numbering and everything related to the
              bus reform, about 6 months before, but still people did not give
              attention. "<br> <br> Adding to the complexity of the changes is the introduction of new
              players to the market, which in the case of Singapore, could be seen as
              early as next year.<br> <br> But how will the potential new operators be able to compete with the existing operators?<br> <br> Stephen Lucas is Chairman of the Australia's Bus Industry Confederation.<br> <br> "Quite often smaller fleets and operators are able to deliver more
              innovative solutions than large operators who really end up being a
              quasi government operations. SBS for example is so large that it
              mirrors in some ways the way we used to operate in Australia before our
              public sector operators were privatised. How many is too many and how
              many is not enough. There is not really an answer to that and it
              depends on the design of the system and for the planners to think very
              carefully what outcome they want out of this. "</p>
