            <div class='col-md body'>Have a few questions about the buses used for sv 170.<br><br>a)What components of the buses used are different from normal ones? I know the emergency door has been repainted red and white stripes. There is an addition light( brake light?) above the advertisement panel on the rear.There is the Malaysian speed limit sticker pasted also. Of coz the green sign  saying Larkin and Queen Street . What else?<br><br>b) Must the buses used to ply sv170 be of white and red body with old SBS logo? Can/ Have any buses which had been repainted with red and purple coat be used on 170?<br><br>c) Cos I saw a SBS 829C (red/purple coat) on Sv 63. It has a additional brake light above the rear ad panel. Should be reserved for Sv 170 or any other reason? I can think of it being transferred from Sv 170 into other services but i dont remember seeing this bus on Sv 170 b4. Why is this bus (SBS 829C) so special?</div>

Wonder if 765 and 770 (non-JB Mk IIIs) will be repainted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So, there is a high chance that repainted MK3 would be used to serve 170. So far, i saw SBS 828E, SBS 829C are installed with 3rd brake light and black box with SBS details( damn clear writing!)Like what other says, SBS 786S too.<br><br>Actually there had been wholly painted ads like Maybank  b4. Shouldnt be much restrictions to have only white unrepainted buses.</div>
