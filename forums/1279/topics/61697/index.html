Rather, Tibs will use the Bendies from sv 184 to beef up other services that needed more high cap buses and release the 12m buses from the beefed up service. Rather impossible for Tibs to deploy Bendy Buses on the very first day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sv 966 would be using 12m O.405 with Hispano and Volgren bodywork as the start. Regarding to whether it would have bendies, that would really depends on how Sv 966 picks up during the monitoring by TIBS.<br><br>As Sv 966 becomes part of the 'family' of Woodlands Depot, Sv 184 will not have Volgren Bendies anymore. The control of Sv 184's deployment would be moved over to Kranji depot with effect from 16 Nov, i.e. commencement of Sv 966. The empty slots of Sv 184's Volgren Bendies would be taken over by other Bendies in Kranji Depot, i.e. Habits, Hispano O.405G.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I took 854 today (TIB1148J) and strange thing is there were 3 sets of bus guides being displayed... 2 were for 854 and the other set was for 966. Does this mean that this Bendy might be used for 966 in the near future or is it just TIBS trying to publicise the 966 route to the commuters?</div>

SMRT Sembawang and Woodlands stations have the service 966 posters. I guess Yishun and Admiralty would have them also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Publicity exercise lah. As predicted Sv. 966 fleet is full O405, with only one Volgren (TIB 972C). Loads are quite healthy for first day service, many of the buses had some standees.<br><br>Journey time from WDL - Marine Parade is 45 mins, faster than the estimated 1 hour. WDL - Jln TPY is about 20 mins. Looks like Sv. 966 will get O405Gs in due course, thanks to the loads. This turns out not to be another Sv. 985 after all.</div>
