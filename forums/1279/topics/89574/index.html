            <div class='col-md body'>Nope. Because taking the bus is still a cheaper alternative.<br><br>But I really hate TV Mobile. Some drivers are so inconsiderate, they turn up the volume so loudly. I don't think anyone would really mind [maybe except for the older generation] if they took off the sound instead. Like, those who want to hear the sound can just tune in to 89.3FM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but would u want to take buses. Let's say you had a choice. Would you take them? or would u rather have not many features and simple fare? you think buses will be more popular with lower fares or more features...?</div>
