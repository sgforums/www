              It should be "biased" in the context of your sentence. There
              had been cases of some hobbyists attempting to disacknowledge
              Gemilang Coachworks. An example was the naming of MAN A22 bus with
              "MAN Lion's CIty Hybrid bodywork", when it is clearly a Gemilang
              bodywork with a licensed design. MAN Lion's City Hybrid is a
              vehicle.<br>
              <br>
              I don't think there are people who appreciates why bus companies
              have been turning to local &amp; regional bodyworks in this
              era.</p>
