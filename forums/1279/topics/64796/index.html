Besides, CCK, BBT and BPJ interchanges are not big enough to hold the entire fleet from KJDEP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not sure bout that.. but from what i see, they like to park their more lousy buses like Dennis Lances and also some Mercedes O405 (OAC &amp; CAC) so it is likely those services with a lot of Lances have to "stay back" at Yishun Int after the day's revenue service.. so likely candidates are Svc 171, 852, 853, 854, 855 with the exception of Bendys from Svc 854, which can easily fill the interchange up with about 60 buses?</div>

They have 7 more years to go, unless Tibs really decided to scrap them which I think is not the case.</div>

KJDEP buses would go back to KJ after a day's work, while some or all AMKDEP buses would park in Yishun Int. That explains why all the UK Lances are seen leaving Yishun around 6+ am while all the DAFs are going up to Yishun.</div>
