            <div class='col-md body'>South Korea is seeking to export low emission buses powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) to Singapore in 2008 as the two countries move to increase co-operation over the fuel technology, the Korea Times reported. Environment Minister Kwak Kyul-ho will sign a memorandum of understanding on the co-operation on CNG technology with Singaporean Ambassador to Seoul Calvin Eu, paving the way for the export of low-emission buses to the Southeast Asian nation, the paper added.<br><br>The signing of the MOU was made possible after leaders of the two countries agreed to sign a Free Trade Agreement last November - it is designed to promote bilateral exchanges on CNG bus technology. The paper said the two countries began discussing the technology collaboration in March 2004, when Singaporean environmental officials went to South Korea to participate in the ministerial environmental forum of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).<br><br>The Singaporean officials showed interest in the Korean CNG buses, observing its smooth operation and competitive prices, 40% cheaper than those from European countries and Japan. Then they agreed with the Korean government to further talks for signing the MOU. Korea introduced the buses in 2000 and 5,752 CNG buses are in operation.<br><br>Â“With the MOU, we expect up to 320 billion won of sales of CNG buses from 2008 to 2025, which translates into 19 billion won of annual sales,Â” Cho Byoung-og, official in charge of the ministry, told the Korea Times. According to Cho, there are currently 3,600 public buses operating in Singapore and they are to be replaced with CNG buses from 2008 as the nation will adopt stricter emissions standards next year.<br><br>The ministry estimates the Korean product will take a 50% share of the market, which means 1,800 Korean-made CNG buses will be running in Singapore. The export price of a Korean CNG bus is estimated at 180 million won. The export of CNG buses to Singapore is also expected to enable Korea to expand into other Southeast Asian countries. Indonesia and the Philippines are considering introducing CNG buses. Â“We will intensively promote the capacity and pro-environment features of our CNG buses to the nations vying to purchase them,'' Cho said, according to the Korea Times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>50 % share of the local (public bus ?) market ?!??<br>Over exggerated hype, i have to say !!<br><br>Because, in the 1st place, how matured is their natural gas bus technology, especially relative to that from the more established makers from Europe ?<br><br>On the more practical front, how viable are current natural gas vehicles really, compared to the current lot of Euro-4 standard diesel vehicles with provision for fuel additive ? Issues like driving range, engine torque output performance, fuel utilisation efficientcy &amp; efficacy, vehicle payload, even safety when compared to the well proven diesel vehicles ?!??<br><br>Modern diesel vehicles whether Euro-4 or Euro-5 with fuel additive technology<br>are also 'pro envirnoment' it cannot be forgotten !! In addition, they have the 'traditional' time proven practical benefits over natural gas in areas mentioned above.<br><br>The overall picture is what which really matters. That therefore CANNOT be merely on the issue of environmental 'friendliness' or emissions alone !! Because if that's so, might as well go back to the era of horse-drawn carriages only, since horses have no exhaust pipe !<br><br>My impressions so far therefore (unfortunately) seem to be that those who seem 'weak' in trying to perfect the time proven diesel engine technology to meet the challenges of new emission demands are the same lot who tries to push for the deployment of natural gas technology instead, seemingly in ignorance of its relative disadvantages with modern (current &amp; up coming) diesel technology !<br><br>If natural gas is really so fantastic, then every other vehicle would have used it by now. That's of course NOT the case &amp; won't be so as long as modern state-of-the-art diesel &amp; (to a lesser extent) petrol engine technologies continue to be more perfected in time to come.<br><br>All things considered, ultimately the well proven diesel (especially) &amp; petrol engine technology would continue to make more sense for deployment, unless there's any 'big breakthrough' in natural gas engine development big enough to turn the tables around, of which is nowhere within sight, however !<br><br>This 'Korean product' mentioned in the original post, wonder if it's from some Korean homegrown marque or instead some established German marque who 'sub-cons' the manufacturing &amp; assembly operations under license to some Korean maker to produce or actually a German maker producing from Korea ??<br><br>As for the issue of 'stricter' emission standards here in future, that does not have to automatically mean only natural gas vehicles would appeal, after all that's been mentioned above ! Modern diesel vehicles with fuel additive technologies of Euro-4 (launched around mid-2005) &amp; Euro-5 (scheduled to take effect from 2009) are practically just as if not ultimately remain THE more appealing choices.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sexy girls:</div><div class="quote_body">South Korea is seeking to export low emission buses powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) to Singapore in 2008 as the two countries move to increase co-operation over the fuel technology, the Korea Times reported.

Issues like driving range, engine torque output performance, fuel utilisation efficientcy &amp; efficacy, vehicle payload, even safety when compared to the well proven diesel vehicles ?!??<br><br>Modern diesel vehicles whether Euro-4 or Euro-5 with fuel additive technology<br>are also 'pro envirnoment' it cannot be forgotten !! In addition, they have the 'traditional' time proven practical benefits over natural gas in areas mentioned above.<br><br>The overall picture is what which really matters. That therefore CANNOT be merely on the issue of environmental 'friendliness' or emissions alone !! Because if that's so, might as well go back to the era of horse-drawn carriages only, since horses have no exhaust pipe !<br><br>My impressions so far therefore (unfortunately) seem to be that those who seem 'weak' in trying to perfect the time proven diesel engine technology to meet the challenges of new emission demands are the same lot who tries to push for the deployment of natural gas technology instead, seemingly in ignorance of its relative disadvantages with modern (current &amp; up coming) diesel technology !<br><br>If natural gas is really so fantastic, then every other vehicle would have used it by now. That's of course NOT the case &amp; won't be so as long as modern state-of-the-art diesel &amp; (to a lesser extent) petrol engine technologies continue to be more perfected in time to come.<br><br>All things considered, ultimately the well proven diesel (especially) &amp; petrol engine technology would continue to make more sense for deployment, unless there's any 'big breakthrough' in natural gas engine development big enough to turn the tables around, of which is nowhere within sight, however !<br><br>This 'Korean product' mentioned in the original post, wonder if it's from some Korean homegrown marque or instead some established German marque who 'sub-cons' the manufacturing &amp; assembly operations under license to some Korean maker to produce or actually a German maker producing from Korea ??<br><br>As for the issue of 'stricter' emission standards here in future, that does not have to automatically mean only natural gas vehicles would appeal, after all that's been mentioned above ! Modern diesel vehicles with fuel additive technologies of Euro-4 (launched around mid-2005) &amp; Euro-5 (scheduled to take effect from 2009) are practically just as if not ultimately remain THE more appealing choices.<br><br></div></blockquote>Do you think we will ever be getting the Merc OC500s anytime soon?</div>

The chassis will have leaf spring suspension.  Think UD suspension, but alot harder.  How is that advanced?  It will have a 5.9L engine, although they have recently introduced an 11.2L engine as well.</div>
