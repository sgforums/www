            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i personally think that service 852 of TIBS shud be withdrawn. Because, the number of pax taking 852 is not very high except during school starting and ending hours. Other than that, it is just running from Bt Batok to Yishun with just 5 or 6 pax. I once took one in the afternoon with only 3 pple including me. It is a waste of money maintaining this route.

This is also why the freq of a bus is ard. 17mins during this time frame, and ard. 25-30mins after 1930.<br><br>However, do take note that the bus is often packed full door to door in the morning due to the morning peak ( folks DO work in Bt. Timah area ), and because of school students. I rely on this svc every school day, and taking 851+ 74 can be quite a hassle sometimes,as both svcs are already bursting.<br><br>Also, it can be hard to get a seat during the evening peak. The fact tt PTC ( then LTA ) reversed its decision to scrape svc 852 when the woodlands extension is completed is due to a petition by students a few years back.<br><br>Next, i agree with you fully that svc 989 should be reinstated. This is because it provides a speedy link to the airport from TPY/Bt Timah area.<br><br>Do take note that both svc 161 and 965 are still considered as very young services. It would be more logical in fact, to scrape svc 965, as the load is even more pathetic than 161 at times. Also, it would reflect very badly on SBST as they are the ones who pioneered this service and route. I doubt they would want to withdraw a route that they had so painstakingly tried to obtain in an enemy's territory. In fact, it can be said that without svc 161, there would not be a svc 965.<br><br>Woodlands Town is about twice the size of Yishun. Hence, the catchment area makes it logical for svc 161 to run. SBST had also adjusted the freq so that it is at least of 30-40% load. Many woodlands residents, and me and scream murder if SBST removes it. It takes 50mins to get from Woodlands to Sengkang by 965, but only 30min by 161, and i had even recorded a time of only 20mins to get to Sengkand Central.<br><br>In conclusion, Svc 161, 168 and 39 are sacred cows to SBST,and 965, 969, 966 are TIBS sacred cows. They would never withdraw these svcs in the near future due to many complex reasons.</div>
