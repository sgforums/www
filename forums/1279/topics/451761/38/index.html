              <p>Actually if SMRT dun wan bendies why they still list it in the tender, for show???</p>
              <p>Anyways, I can think of pros and cons of SMRT having DDs only.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pros</span></p>
              <p>1. Less jams at the bus stop, bus int and road(esp. one lane roads like Tiong Bahru Rd) Less parking woes at the bus int and depots.</p>
              <p>2. More seats.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cons</span></p>
              <p>1. The runtime of SMRT services will be longer. From Thomson Rd-Tiong Bahru, it will take 20mins for 851. But with DDs, 40mins... Service 300/302's runtime will also be longer.</p>
              <p>2. Some services with road issues cannot have DDs either, like service 800, which has a tight turn at Yishun St 71(same as C'wealth Dr issue).</p>
              <p>I would still prefer bendies for Feeders/Intratowns and Short Distance routes like 856/859/962/964 etc. and DDs for CBD services and Long Distance Routes.</p>
              <p>CCK has no problems with bendies. Absolutely no problem.</p>
              <p>BBT no problems but parking woes. Current situation is still fine.</p>
              <p>BPJ has bus stop, road and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p>SBW has no problems with bendies. Absolutely no problem.</p>
              <p>YIS has bus stop, road, bus int and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p>WDL has bus int and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p><span>But bear in mind, once you use DDs, the runtime for 300/302/800/804/806/811/812/</span>856/859/900<span>/901/903/911/912/913/962/964 will be longer. DDs have speed issues as well as boarding and alighting issues and the top deck issues.</span></p>
              <p>Keep in mind that service 969's runtime will be severly lengthened by x2!</p>
              <p><strong>Boarding and alighting</strong></p>
              <p>If the commuters vacate the bus earlier with the help of an extra door, wouldn't the commuters be able to board faster too? Since when the commuters alighted, there will be more space to move in to the rear. But boarding only at interchanges is a problem.</p>
              <p>Bendy to unload- 2 mins.</p>
              <p>DD to unload- 6 mins.</p>
              <p>3 Doors DD to unload- 4 mins due to the NARROW stairs.</p>
              <p>This is especially very useful on the high demand services 800/804/806/811/812/912/913.</p>
              <p><strong>3 Doors DD</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, 3 Doors DD is useful, but have you ever forgotten about the stairs? Narrow and steep, commuters at the upper deck still have to climb down, which is slow and troublesome.</p>
              <p><strong>Top Deck Issues</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, more people have moved up to the top deck recently, like 291/334/Bedok/Boon Lay Feeders(except 241A). But there are still people who refuse to go up, which is the reason why SBST refused to deploy DDs on service 238.(And due to tight turn issues). </p>
              <p>Note: There ARE still some SBST services in which people don't move up. (I think SMB128B has mentioned about service 87/238 before. But I may have seen wrongly.)</p>
              <p>And people not moving to the rear of a bendy is NOT true, look at WDL/YIS feeders and intratowns. 856 yes but nobody wanted to stand at the narrow rear aisle. Even on O405s, be it SD/DD(Lower Deck)/Bendy, nobody would want to stand at the narrow rear aisle. This excludes the top deck of DDs, due to the no standing rule. BTW there's no "that kind of aisle" at the top deck...</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth, dun blast me for this.</p>

              <p>Personal experience:</p>
              <p>854 bendy from Eunos Link to HG ave 2 takes the same amount of time as DD on 25 on the same route.</p>
              <p>106 bendy from Stamford Road to Holland Village takes the same amount of time as DD on same route.</p>
              <p>From where do you draw conclusions that 851 will take the double amount of time on DDs? It does not travel on expressway like 969 to chiong / drive fast - no scope.</p>

              the issue of placing bendies on the tender is pretty simple, continue on using it... investment made on bendy infrastructure on POV of SMRT...

              <p>You still don't get what his logic means? I believe he is talking about the speed of a DD is slower than a bendy because of the height of the DD. The force of gravity become stronger with the height and with passengers onboard both decks, the DD becomes slower in travelling. Even though the passenger capacity affects the bendy as well, but length does not affect gravity and thus bendies are still faster than DDs.</p>
