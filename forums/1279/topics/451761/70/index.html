              <p>yes, the feeders might have a longer distance, but, what about the stops in between? is it just a plain feeder/intratown service which just transports people from between the interchange and their own homes, or dropping off and picking up many pax along the way, especially if there are many facilities along the route, like hospitals, shopping centres, schools. people wont be willing to move up if its just a short 10-15 minute journey.</p>
              <p>thats why DDs fare better for trunk services from the heartlands to the city, people will be very willing to move up because their journey will surely be quite long, and getting a seat is better. people are willing to stand if their journey is just a short hop from the interchange to their homes (vice-versa).</p>

              <p>isnt it obvious that the DD purchase will be longer than the bendy? the A24 was rumoured to be at gemilang's bodywork plant way before the tender for high-capacity buses was called. the only reason that SMRT is willing to buy 30 more bendies is just showing that SMRT is still confident that bendies are still needed to supplement its operations, and i'm sure SMRT will place an order for the E500/K310UD (provided they participated in the tender) soon, once the details are confirmed.</p>

              <p>yes i can agree that the citaros are horrendous in braking, compounded by the fact that the engine has to rev high for optimum performance (but with suboptimum fuel consumption). took a citaro home yesterday and the bus jerked so badly it almost threw me forward. first time this has happened to me in non-emergency situations.</p>

              <p>difficult to maintain and lots of issues associated with the engine and possibly higher maintenance costs in the years to come. and as cliche as it may seem, they vibrate alot, something which no one wants. why settle with KUDs when you can get Enviro 500s? HK's E500s make up a huge percentage of the high capacity bus fleet compared to KUDs for a reason if you failed to realize.</p>
              <p>what are the chances SMRT will buy more Scanias considering the fact they allowed the L113CRLs to be retired without any lifespan extension even with refurbishments? furthermore it is said that alexander dennis representatives were seen in SMRT premises already</p>

              <p>pax wont move up to the upper deck on svcs 241,243 and 291
              because they only take these svcs for only a few stops. Esp 291.
              Which most bus stops are of walking distance</p>

              <p>You need to observe more. 241 upper deck always full during peak hours. 243W has taken very good response to DDs, if it was possible SBST would have deployed DDs on 243G as well. 291 DDs - bunching is a problem, but otherwise upper deck gets well utilized. At Tampines Int, personnel are specially deployed to guide passenger movement for this service. Each bus carried 100+ pax during peak hours, not possible if upper deck is not getting utilized. </p>

              and as cliche as it may seem, they vibrate alot, something which no
              one wants. why settle with KUDs when you can get Enviro 500s? HK's

              <p>and SBST bought 1100 of those KUB in both Euro IV and Euro V in 2 batches each ...</p>
              <p>Enviro500 would be better given that the fact that SMRT would favour Dennis over Scanias</p>
