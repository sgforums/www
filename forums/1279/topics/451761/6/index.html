                  You are the one who suggested that I should go and face the pressure on the stage and take over SMRT since I complained too much. Fine, since you are the smart alec who suggested this idea, then go and write an email and make it happen. Why now? Chickened out? Realizing your idea is nothing but bullshit which won't happened? You only know how to talk and spout rubbish but push the blame and responsibility to others when you realised your folly. Typical SMRT rotten behavior. Stop inherit their rotten behavior and keep on making a fool of yourself, SMRT fanboy. 
                  
                  
                  Of course, you won't want to bring other countries into the picture because it only makes SMRT damn stupid, right? Only want to hear the good things.

              Yeah, they have already know what kind of screwed up company SMRT is based on the past events. You can even "officially" see the complains on the newspapers, Internet, forums, Facebook, Twitter, etc. even the company health and stock prices have shown how screwed this company is because of its past arrogance, irresponsibility and lost of focus in its operations. And all these are official news to let all Singaporeans know that SMRT has completely failed in what it basically needs to achieve.

              happened? You only know how to talk and spout rubbish but push the
              blame and responsibility to others when you realised your folly.
              Typical SMRT rotten behavior. Stop inherit their rotten behavior
              and keep on making a fool of yourself, SMRT fanboy. Of course, you
              won't want to bring other countries into the picture because it
              only makes SMRT damn stupid, right? Only want to hear the good
              things.</p>

              <p>Yes. If you are game enough, do it. Complaining won't solve things here. I'm not going to do it for you because you are the one whacking non-stop. Day in and out you only learn to complain about SMRT's inefficiency but yet you can do nothing about it. Game enough? Write on your own. Don't link me with their rotten behaviour if you don't know me personally. I know when to draw a line between reality and fiction unlike you whacking all day long. Stop comparing ours with other countries because our land is completely different from them. Their structure is different from us and doesn't make SMRT look stupid. Look if you want to continue all this I'm fine it just shows how juvenile you are.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>In the first place, I am not even interested in your "smart" idea, because I know it will never happen. So why should I "game enough" to go with your "smart idea" in the first place? You suggested it since you think it can help me solve the problem. Fine, you go write the letter because I won't do such a thing that will not work. If you wrote the email to them and they agree, please let the whole world know, you win, your idea works. If this "smart" idea can work, everyone can be the CEO of SMRT because everyone is very unhappy with SMRT way of managing their services and the kind of screwed service they rendered for them all these years.</li>
              <li> I know complaining here won't change anything but at least I share on my past bad experiences on how badly they managed their own customers feedbacks and complaints. Before I even joined this forum, I had done my part to feedback and complain on the aspects that SMRT failed to fulfill since they absorbed TIBS. Despite years of complains, incidents, they refused to listen, take their own sweet time to improve but yet keep on increasing fares every year which is not justifiable for their service standards. Even in the mainstream media, despite complains and incidents report, nothing much improved. They continued their way of doing things, neglecting the basics of providing a good service while concentrating paying fat profits to their shareholders. Look now, what happened, operations failed badly, profits dropped, share price tumbled, can of worms finally opened. That has already a fact, only you yourself keeps on denying with false information and your own fiction. </li>
              <li>Your earlier arguements in this thread has already shown that you just want to win arguements, using lame factless claims to keep on supporting your nonsense, acting like you are some big shot here demanding "official" news for prove to you, while many of these people are telling you nicely what is actually the most likely scenario.</li>
              <li> Can't compare because of differences in what way? Land is bigger, thus some companies are bigger, yet they can manage well. SMRT is relatively very small as compared to them and yet it failed so badly. If such a small company is managed so badly, then there is something very wrong with the company structure, the mangement. Even in the recent news, it has already said that SMRT don't even have a standard proper SOP for major train disruptions. So what does it tell you? </li>
              <li>Lastly back to the first point again. Who do you think you are to judge me then? Who are you to tell me to be the CEO of SMRT when I complain about them? Don't act like you know everything and try to act like a big shot here, demanding this and that which can solve your solution. I don't want to challenge your childish act of challenging me a flame war like those kids previously. </li>
              <li>Mr carbikebus and other bus fans are right, you are the real joker making a fool out of yourself time after time here. My last advice for you: Stop acting like a big shot here demanding this and that here, you don't believe then it's your own business, don't stop people from sharing information here. If you can't give sustainable solutions, then just keep quiet and see how others do it. Giving pointers like "since you are so smart, you go do it" but you yourself can't even do it, shows you are a NATO only. I rest my case.</li>

              <p>2-3 years is good enough. They are expanding their facilities and just one more depot. Only the current Woodlands depot seems unable to house dds, which will probably for servicing single deckers only. The other depots can support dds. And just in time to replace the first batch of bendies.<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></span></p>
              <p>Current Yishun interchange will be torn down by next year. The shophouses around the area is getting ready to be torn now. Scaffoldings are already erected around the shophouses and construction vehicles are inside there for weeks already. I think they are going to announce building a new temp interchange for Yishun soon and it's immediate that it is ready to allow SMRT to use dds in it.</p>
