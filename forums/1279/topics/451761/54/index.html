              <p>The bendy bus jam isn't really happening everyday every hours~ </p>
              <p>If LTA wants a change, then I recommend 80% of Double deck buses in Singapore to get a 3-door version(like London Route master, but w/o the hop in/out feature) If you want to change bendy to DD, might as well change the entire fleet to better and much efficient. Like that can solve both alighting fast problem and length~ </p>
              <p>But still, LTA must see the bus stop shelter length. Best is to have it longer than the bus bay, like that the front bus can stop further(bend out part)~ Not only that, they must be willing to even cut down more trees branches, adjust the entire land area, including road size. </p>
              <p>As for those whom area is like CMI like, place a 2-door, 2-axle version~~ If possible, limit all WAB area to 1 per bus and the steps to be something like KMB version~ Overall, it's more like HK fleet~~</p>
              <p>Ah Gong got money, it's whether he wanna use it or not~ Don't use it, later rot, also wasted~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              KMB ever tried 3 door, but it didn't work eventually...
              
              Issue is not over fast alighting, cos there's boarding bus stops to bother with.. so Int area evening peak can implement 2 door boarding?
              
              How to have shelter length longer than bus stop bay in reality? 
              
              Bend out part? Then how the bus driver going to move off? Esp at mandatory give way bus stop? Stop until like that... he dun inch out also cannot, inch out can side swipe w/ vehicles easily...

              <p>LTA should trial the 3 door version(following the London New Routemaster layout), and perhaps using 2-door entry at interchange, 1-door entry for the rest of the route. Fast alighting/boarding can seriously save time, much easier to clear the queue when there's jam~ </p>
              <p>And obviously a 70% target for all roads to have bus lane, if possible. </p>
              <p>Regarding the shelter length longer than bus stop bay, simply follow the bus stop bay layout : <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">\</span></strong>_____________/ <br>Seeing the red slash(gradient not there, but rough~), as long the gradient isn't steep, buses can still stop there(Try spotting a less steep gradient bus bay, and that the passenger last min chasing for bus and board, and of cause not the entire bus totally follow the gradient). That can "push in" more buses behind during peak hours. </p>
              <p>Also~ If possible, try placing any objects slightly inwards to the pavement esp. when the bus turning left&lt;. If the road is narrow, like svc 911's st 82(link to ave4 part), try putting a yellow box on the lane next to the opposite direction to ease turning. Rigids/bendy have went onto the pavement before when the turning is really cmi, quite dangerous if they would to intro DD~</p>

              <p>It will cause many buses to mount kerb (the last tip after the bus bay and normal road) after moving out of the bus bay if the gradient of the bus bay is that narrow. And it is especially dangerous for longer bendy buses because it will be harder for BCs to judge the rear (because blind spot is even tighter for such a long vehicle) and the possibility of the last axle to mount kerb to be even much higher. This is especially dangerous if people are to stand near that area. If they are lucky, their feet are squashed by the bendy bus rear axles, if not, they might be even pinned to death under the bendy bus.</p>
              <p>And don't think by steepening the gradient will do much to cater for bendy buses. Instead, LTA will be more happy to squeeze in more standard length buses of different services into the bus bay.</p>
              <p>Just put a car at our current bus bay already causing many problems for buses to move out, still want to narrow the gradient.</p>

              <p>Actually they can introduce the 2 door entry systems for high demand services during peak hours. It is still feasible.</p>
              <p>Well, public bus transport doesn't serve just for a small group of bus fans but for the whole of Singaporeans and also providing the welfare of BCs as well.</p>
              <p>After looking at the long bus queues caused by bendy buses outside Woodlands depot in the wee hours of midnight, certainly the long queues caused by bendy buses had wasted a lot of time of the BCs just to wait outside the depot to park their buses inside, instead which their time can be used to go home early to rest. If bendy buses can be pharsed out, not only it means that the daily bus operations can be improved, but also, it can improve the working hours and driving environments of the BCs as well.</p>

              death under the bendy bus.</p>
              <p>And don't think by steepening the gradient will do much to cater
              for bendy buses. Instead, LTA will be more happy to squeeze in more
              standard length buses of different services into the bus bay.</p>
              <p>Just put a car at our current bus bay already causing many
              problems for buses to move out, still want to narrow the
              gradient.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> Way better my foot. Just look at the tons of problems it have
              internally and externally just show how medicore this company is in
              terms of managing its daily operations.</p>
              <p>If SMRTB is really keen on improving, just be practical and do
              the necessary improvements that are practical, and not for the sake
              to be different and not being practical to solve problems but
              instead cause more problems to the commuters.</p>

              <p>Firstly, by stopping slightly forward, it doesn't even affect anything. The bus still can turns out safely. Even if that isn't suggested, I don't even think Singapore transport have a good safety system please~  Don't even think about buses yet, nowadays car driver also anyhow. TP also not spotted on road~ So you think they drivers care? No please, not all drivers are so following the law always. However, I don't see any danger by stopping just abit infront, not as if the whole bus is directly stopping on the "\" part <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
              <p>Got cause problem to commuters meh? You can't improve up till the standard there, there always gotta be more than what the standard wants. Don't tell me you're just gonna get a pass for your exam, and after that being happy over it? Wow~~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>
