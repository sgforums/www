              <p><br>The new bus interchanges are getting smaller and there will be more buses on the roads in future so it is more practical that SMRT to replace the bendy buses with double deckers soon. I do agree that LTA should give some incentives for SMRT to replace all of their bendy buses with double deckers to improve their bus services for once. That is if SMRT is really serious in improving about their bus services, with such arrangement as one good example to show us they are serious.</p>
              <p>190 loads will definately be affected by DTL. But still it needs a good number of double deckers.</p>

              <p><br>Observed and as what some of the forum mates says, they are a total disaster especially during morning peak hours.</p>
              <p>I took 853 last Tuesday morning when I was on my day off. I have to wait for at least 5 minutes before the rows of buses to clear off the exit of Yishun bus interchange into Yishun Ave 2 before my bus can even exit the interchange.</p>
              <p>Most of the buses blocked the way and mostly bendy buses. One 856, one 812, one 806, one 800, one 969 and two single deckers 811 and 171 used up the whole strech of bus lane (Yishun Ave 2) outside the bus stop outside Northpoint and the one behind Yishun Bus Interchange. One bendy bus 856, tried to cut into the bus lane which were blocked by 3 bendy buses  at the bus lane, which result it blocking the way of an ambulance on the 2nd lane for a few minutes.</p>
              <p>It was at least about 5 minutes later that these bendy buses begin to clear the bus lane. Another single decker 169 also took about 3 minutes before it can finally let its passengers alight. It was chaotic and a few hornings were blasted at that time. I think the situation was more or less the same when these buses went into the alighting berths of Yishun interchange.</p>
              <p>There is also a good write up on Woodlands interchange that the jams  caused by these buses by one person here before.</p>
              <p>I guess those forumers who experience these everyday and complain are right afterall. Bendy buses are not suitable for Singapore bus operations. If SMRT really want and serious about improving its bus services, then replace all the bendy buses with double deckers as I believe these bendy buses are one of the reasons that SMRT bus services are seriously delayed at times.</p>

              <p><br>If you replace bendies with SDs, it is not going to be able to take the load. This is definitely not what LTA is promising us. Imagine 190, 969, 854 with full SD fleet. Will not work.</p>

              <p>291, 222, 334 are intra-town, feeder services that are doing very well with DDs, and if you observe the top, it has a good # of pax.</p>
              <p>225 which has only 4 stops, can also be seen with a fully seated upper deck.</p>
              <p>With Woodlands / Yishun, the # of stops / distance is even more from MRT, and I am sure the upper deck will get well utilized.</p>

              <p>If SMRT dosent buy DDs, ask him to move to the area flooded with the most number of buses if he still wants to stay in the north. Woodlands, got svc 161 with only 1 SD and 168 with full DD fleet.</p>
