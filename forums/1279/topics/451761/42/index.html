              <p>Are you crazy? Look at 300 case (or any feeder services that
              have the same issue as 300), they need to have at least 15-20 (or
              more) single deck buses to solve the problem which also use alot of
              parking space. If bendy buses on 300 are pack like hell, you think
              single deck buses can solve the problem? </p>

              the problem is this..
              
              from the beginning no one wanted to raise anything at all... and to make matters worst, most of the integrated public tpt hubs designed by LTA no longer takes into consideration the needs of bendies...
              
              you adapt to things, not you go try and change the entire system just for you...
              
              SMRT isn't the one to build the infrastructure, so then it's to adapt to it. That's how govt intervention works in reality.
              
              The worst thing is the COI report... The content for those who'd read it, would know what on earth is going on...
              
              but no! all decided to engage into name calling...

              <p>I highly doubt SMRT will be purchasing bendies.</p>
              <p>There are signs all over that the public is unhappy with bendies.</p>
              <p>Yet there has been no corresponding sign that the govt is willing to accommodate these buses.</p>
              <p>Unless SMRT wants to get more brickbats from govt, which I really do not think so, especially with the current 3 star, I would put my money on the bendy trial being a one-off affair....if it even happens.</p>
              <p>Dont forget SMRT has been screwed by 2 ministries already in just space of a year.</p>

              <p>Baseless assumptions.</p>
              <p>Runtime won't be longer even if SMRTB uses double deckers. And
              SMRTB bus services needs a bit more runtime for many bus services
              as most BCs have to rush to complete the journey. This adds up to
              the stress they are facing driving the bus services everyday. No
              wonder the PRC BCs went on strike and may are unhappy with the
              working hours and conditions.</p>
              <p>Boarding and unloading time is more of less the same for both
              double deckers and bendy buses. But bendy buses take up much more
              space in the bus stop and delaying other buses behind. Double
              deckers on the other hand gives the flexibility for other buses
              behind to stop and allow boarding and alighting and do not delay
              buses behind. I don't see double deckers along bus stops delaying
              other buses but the long queues caused by bendy buses
              always delays other buses.</p>
              <p>Upper deck seating issues is improving, in fact many people are
              moving up because they want to find a seat and break away from the
              crowd in the lower deck. Bendy buses are also problematic when
              people do not want to move into the rear of the bus. Feeder
              services will be better to improved with more frequencies using
              single deckers, unless LTA wants to cut down the number of feeder
              services. Long frequencies using bendy buses is not efficient for
              places with many services.</p>
              <p><br> If they want to reject, why not?</p>
              <p>Bendy buses are not relevant to their operational needs anymore.
              They created more problems to SMRTB instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> If you have noticed, many of these SMRTB buses are already
              exceeding the speed limits for commercial vehicles. Wonder
              what are all the TPs doing.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Don't be a dumbat, DDs have their own disadvantages. Cannot stand on the second deck.. Whereas bendy buses you can stand on the trailer, stairs are narrow on DDs and falling is more prone. I agree that bendies take more space but those services which are jam packed by people should use bendies. Cause there is more standing space. Don't be a freak who always targets bendies.</p>

              <p>Govt office hr still the standard one.</p>

              that's movable...
              
              obviously your didn't notice the emergency exercise what went on...
              
              jumpbus system at WB bus stop??? End up 1 SMRT Citaro decided to jump stop because of long queue at WB bus stop since 1 bay is out...
              
              something movable and something parking over there are entirely diff things...
              
              183 bunching up is not uncommon... Observe how SBST deals w/ 183's never ending queue at Jurong East Int in the morning... ADDs are packed even though dist to Toh Guan Rd East is abt 3.2km
