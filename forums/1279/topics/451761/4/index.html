              <p>However, if u have noticed, the newer rail lines are effectively trying to replicate buses. MRT lines are meant to move alot of people quickly between big stations. Notice the number of stops on the newer rail lines (e.g. CCL, DTL, TSL especially). If you try to take a train and it stops 20times before getting to your destination, how is that fast? Therefore i say the LTA are trying to replace bus networks with the newer lines that have many stops.</p>

              <p>Have you taken a look at how standee unfriendly is the kmb avbwu wrights? No one would want to walk into the aisle after the rear doors. Good thing is that they are meant for long distances and not short distance crush loading as per used in sg. This is also why sbst opted for a more VO style of interior to promote people to walk in.</p>

              <p>I feel SDs cannot carry more than 65 pax. I have seen with 195 at Tiong Bahru. People try to squeeze in and it gets so uncomfortable to stuff more than 30 standing, and the seats are only 35.</p>
              <p>Consider a DD. It already has ~80 seats where people can sit comfortably plus can take around 30 standees easily. So a good 110 pax fit in. For longer routes, it becomes even more critical to ply just DDs coz riding on a SD in peak hours is extremely uncomfortable. </p>

              <p>Have you taken a look at how standee unfriendly is the kmb avbwu
              wrights? No one would want to walk into the aisle after the rear
              doors. Good thing is that they are meant for long distances and not
              short distance crush loading as per used in sg. This is also why
              sbst opted for a more VO style of interior to promote people to

                      also, i believe having some ADDs is the solution to increase productivity also also cost reduction which our govt is aiming at nowadays! It can reduce manpower, save fuel consumption and maintenance costs overall. May even need less space for new bus interchanges. Or else is LTA going to spare 4-6 parking lots per high demand bus service at the bus interchange if SMRT decides a 100% SD regular bus fleet? Or just "tekan" their service leaders by denying them adequate breaks at the interchanges?
                  
                  for PBS routes for eg, they maybe can cut down from 2 trips to only 1 trip if a SD is replaced with ADD. Again, its productivity.
              
              On a side note, I believe the staircase onboard ADD should face the exit door directly to facilitate better movement when its crowded (eg Leyland and Volvo Olympian). I find the Wrights are not able to perform well in this situation.

              I'll say why bendies were later on ditched by SBS... I'll state those that's speaking of the obvious, but people still dun wish to believe it...
              
              1) Bus park/ depot: Imagine overnight you've to get more depots or space to accommodate the bendies. Land lease is expensive in Singapore. So the other way is to make multi storey...
              
              But such bus parks need bigger space as the bendies need space to turn in and out of the ramps.
              
              2) Bus stop: Dun say at Bt Panjang anymore, say our bus stops at Orchard (C K Tang, Lucky Plaza), Robinson Rd, Selegie Rd.. They aren't meant for bendies.
              
              Another factor is some bus stops are located right after traffic light or junctions like Thomson Rd/ Novena Church. 
              
              3) Road: Now I figured out about the sinking issue. The engine of bendies are located at the 2nd carriage, and as the bus moves, the vehicles literally shakes, creating additional forces/ stress onto the road.
              
              4) Roadside bus terminals: We still have them esp to make it relevant Marina Centre Terminal. Now how many buses can you park at any time w/ bendies?
              
              5) Bus Interchanges: The newer ones are alrdy very cramp, not designed for bendies.
              
              Even the Woodlands Int, now I realise there's also parking issues w/ so many bendies deployed.

              <p>Your analysis is absolutely right. </p>
              <p>Just yesterday I saw 2 bendies back to back on route 851 near Tiong Bahru Plaza. Imagine the crazy traffic and queue it created with 851 being followed with a 33 and 195. It was like there is a queue of 6 buses.</p>
              <p>The first 851 was seated capacity, and the second completely empty (both towards Bukit Merah).</p>
              <p>The stop at Tiong Bahru Plaza is right after the signal, so only one bendy could accommodate, and even though it was a green signal the other had to wait on the other side of the signal with 33 and 195 stopping behind it. </p>
              <p>The bendies make travel slower for other buses also. It is not fit for CBD area / inner roads. PIE / TPY etc bendies are ok.</p>

              <p>1) This is the problem they should learn how to solve, not avoiding it.<br>2) Orchard,Selegie,and Robinson road are pretty-much jam-prone during peak hours, With or without bendies things will still stay the same. Even if there is no bendies what about jams caused by other cars?<br>5) Even if it isn't bendy-friendly, They still have to live with it. It is not every design is suited to fit them.<br>4) This, Have to depend on frequency. If they are not tight enough one should do the trick. </p>
