              <p>Just something to share when I drove past Woodlands depot (along Woodlands Industrial Park E4) last night, time range about 12 midnight to 1am, after I drove around the area to drop my friend back to his home nearby.</p>
              <p>Saw a long stretch of queue of buses (single deckers and bendy bus) stretching from all the way from SMRTB side entrance along Woodlands Industrial Park E4 all the way to almost the end of Woodlands Industrial Park E5, waiting to return to depot and park the buses inside. A few MANs (with hazard lights on) parked the opposite lane along Woodlands Industrial Park E4, opposite Woodlands depot.</p>
              <p>Driving further down towards Admiralty Road West, saw a few more single deckers (with hazard lights on) after Woodlands depot stopping by the kerb and the BCs are outside either resting or smoking. There was a SMRT personnel outside the entrance to direct the buses into the depot.</p>
              <p>Is the situation really that bad for SMRTB depots that there is always parking crunch inside the depots and buses end up forming long queues and start/stop bumper to bumper outside the depot until every BCs spend hours wait for their turn to enter the depot to park the buses? Are bendy buses really took up too much space in depots that cause this parking crunch problem everyday? Or is it the poor fleet management by SMRTB whoch do not specifically allocate a designated slot for every bus to prevent such delays and long queues of buses outside the depot?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I really pitied the BCs who have to spend their times for such delays to just park their buses back to their respective depots whereby if there are enough parking slots in the depot and shorter bus queues, they would have went home earlier and have more time to rest.</p>
              <p>Problem is the poor management and heck care attitude of SMRTB all the while. It might be caused by bendy buses taking up too much spaces, which resulted in parking crunch and allocation problems. and these buses attributing long bus queues formed up along roads, which cause such delays even in non operational hours.  And other problems highlighted by other forum mates in this thread and other threads.</p>
              <p>Main point is,</p>
              <p>Is more resting time for BCs after work more important, especially after driving for almost half a day everyday but still have to deprive more hours just because of waiting to park their bus back to depot?</p>
              <p>And as highlighted by other forum mates, is the efficiency of bus services and operations more important, as compared to long queues formed by buses and detoriated by bendy buses along bus lanes, bus interchanges and even bus depots, be it operational hours or non operational hours? Is the fleet management efficiency more important, as compared to space crunch caused by bendy buses and high accident and burnt down rates of bendy buses?</p>
              <p>Go figure these questions above. Are these points above more important than just for the sake of having bendy buses for more varieties? Although I may attribute most of SMRTB woes back to their poor management issues, but from the recent debates on this topic as well from other forum mates, I would like to question: are bendy buses also the cause of the downfall of SMRTB in terms of better management and operations? Still viable in the long run?</p>
              <p>I have talked to a few SMRTB BCs before. And many of them do not like driving bendy buses, citing reasons like hard and take longer time to change lanes and overtake, have to take extra careful when turning and reversing because of the lenght, especially reversing, delays caused by these buses as they block their way to move out of or into the berth and result in excessive honkings, etc.</p>
              <p>Just some thoughts to share here.</p>

              <p>To 'vicamour', I think I might add onto your post about what the SMRT drivers. From what I observed lately, quite a number of those driving Bendies they're actually quite resigned to the fact that they can't tell / see clearly who is alighting or not from the front of the bus. There's the mirrors, but from the front it seems like they still can't see much, esp on crowded Bendies (which is quite common).</p>
              <p>Which then brings them to using the closing of the doors to gauge if there's people alighting. If the doors bounce back open, that means someone is alighting. Otherwise, assume that everyone's done &amp; drive off. Not sure if anyone else noticed this? It's a safety hazard waiting for an accident to happen though..</p>

              <p>To 'vicamour', I think I might add onto your post about what the
                  SMRT drivers. From what I observed lately, quite a number of those
                  driving Bendies they're actually quite resigned to the fact that
                  they can't tell / see clearly who is alighting or not from the
                  front of the bus. There's the mirrors, but from the front it seems
                  like they still can't see much, esp on crowded Bendies (which is
                  quite common).</p>
              <p>Which then brings them to using the closing of the doors to
                  gauge if there's people alighting. If the doors bounce back open,
                  that means someone is alighting. Otherwise, assume that everyone's
                  done &amp; drive off. Not sure if anyone else noticed this? It's a
                  safety hazard waiting for an accident to happen though..</p>

              <p>Just something to share when I drove past Woodlands depot (along
              Woodlands Industrial Park E4) last night, time range about 12
              midnight to 1am, after I drove around the area to drop my
              friend back to his home nearby.</p>
              <p>Saw a long stretch of queue of buses (single deckers and bendy
              bus) stretching from all the way from SMRTB side entrance along
              Woodlands Industrial Park E4 all the way to almost the end of
              Woodlands Industrial Park E5, waiting to return to depot and park
              the buses inside. A few MANs (with hazard lights on) parked the
              opposite lane along Woodlands Industrial Park E4, opposite
              Woodlands depot.</p>
              <p>Driving further down towards Admiralty Road West, saw a few more
              single deckers (with hazard lights on) after Woodlands depot
              stopping by the kerb and the BCs are outside either resting or
              smoking. There was a SMRT personnel outside the entrance to direct
              the buses into the depot.</p>
              <p>Is the situation really that bad for SMRTB depots that there is
              always parking crunch inside the depots and buses end up forming
              long queues and start/stop bumper to bumper outside the depot until
              every BCs spend hours wait for their turn to enter the depot
              to park the buses? Are bendy buses really took up too much
              space in depots that cause this parking crunch problem everyday? Or
              is it the poor fleet management by SMRTB whoch do
              not specifically allocate a designated slot for every bus to
              prevent such delays and long queues of buses outside the depot?</p>
              <p>Sometimes I really pitied the BCs who have to spend their times
              for such delays to just park their buses back to their respective
              depots whereby if there are enough parking slots in the depot
              and shorter bus queues, they would have went home earlier and
              have more time to rest.</p>
              <p>Problem is the poor management and heck care attitude of SMRTB
              all the while. It might be caused by bendy buses taking
              up too much spaces, which resulted in parking crunch and allocation
              problems. and these buses attributing long bus queues formed up
              along roads, which cause such delays even in non operational hours.
               And other problems highlighted by other forum mates in this
              thread and other threads.</p>
              <p>Main point is,</p>
              <p>Is more resting time for BCs after work more important,
              especially after driving for almost half a day everyday but still
              have to deprive more hours just because of waiting to park their
              bus back to depot?</p>
              <p>And as highlighted by other forum mates, is the efficiency of
              bus services and operations more important, as compared to
              long queues formed by buses and detoriated by bendy buses
              along bus lanes, bus interchanges and even bus depots, be it
              operational hours or non operational hours? Is the
              fleet management efficiency more important, as compared to
              space crunch caused by bendy buses and high accident and burnt down
              rates of bendy buses?</p>
              <p>Go figure these questions above. Are these points above
              more important than just for the sake of having bendy buses
              for more varieties? Although I may attribute most of SMRTB
              woes back to their poor management issues, but from the recent
              debates on this topic as well from other forum mates, I would like
              to question: are bendy buses also the cause of the downfall of
              SMRTB in terms of better management and operations? Still viable in
              the long run?</p>
              <p>I have talked to a few SMRTB BCs before. And many of them do not
              like driving bendy buses, citing reasons like hard and take longer
              time to change lanes and overtake, have to take extra careful when
              turning and reversing because of the lenght, especially reversing,
              delays caused by these buses as they block their way to move out
              of or into the berth and result in excessive honkings,
              etc.</p>
              <p>Just some thoughts to share here.</p>

              <p>The parking crunch at the depot is very bad. From what an SL told me, SMRT adjusted the timetables for the PM slot to start later because of this.</p>
              <p>Bendy buses can carry more people than DDs. They are longer BUT the faster boarding and alighting offsets this, so I don't see why SMRT should drop bendies totally.</p>

              <p><br>Carbikebus, my take for the reorganisation of SMRTB if the new CEO really cares about the bus operations this time.</p>
              <p>- You have mentioned that Ang Mo Kio and Kranji Depot to be shifted soon. So Ang Mo Kio depot should shift somewhere near to the current site but bigger for more buses (Approx 300 buses.) Kranji to moved to Mandai with about 400 buses. The new upcoming Woodlands depot for about 300 buses. That should cater about 1000 buses in future. All noew depots should be double decker friendly.</p>
              <p>- Standardise all the fleet to normal lenght (12m) including single deckers and double deckers only to make economies of scales in purchasing and maintainance more cost efficient and much more easier (e.g parts, parking, maintanance). I think SMRTB should stop using bendy buses based on the parking crunch I observed yesterday. Even if they can last for this generation, they won't enter into the next generation. Like what some forums mates have said, they aren't really suitable in crowded country like Singapore in the long run. SMRTB might as well correct the mistakes and problems from now, if they really serious about improving.</p>
              <p>- Geylang Depot fate is mostly decided one day. The govt will not waste such a prime land for a bus depot. Most likely it will become a high end residential/commercial site since it is near the MRT. Matter is how soon or late it is. SMRTB can use the current Woodlands depot site instead to service SMRT cabs and Bus Plus buses instead and other non public bus operations, such as repairing other vehicles out of their boundary, if they stubbornly think it is still al right. Public bus operations are only based in other depots like the new one in Woodlands and replacements for Ang Mo Kio and Kranji.</p>
              <p>- Lastly, SMRTB should stop operating all shuttle bus services and RWS services and concentrate the resources (BCs and buses) to more improvements, like introducing at least 2 basic trunk services in Sembawang.</p>

              <p>standardising the fleet to 12m buses is not an option. its a matter of finding space to park and deploying them to the correct service. what will happen to high-demand routes that cannot have DDs? put more 12m buses? they can't even find enough drivers.</p>
              <p>right now they are sticking to merc, MAN and gemilang for a reason. merc (OC/Citaro) and MAN engine spare parts are interchangeable and its easy and fast to get spare parts for bodywork.</p>
              <p>stopping the usage of bendy buses will paralyse SMRT. quite a number of their routes need high capacity buses and DDs wont make the cut because of height restrictions along the route. the same as my above point, buy more 12m rigids but nobody to drive them.</p>
              <p>stopping their shuttle bus services is as good as throwing out busplus. what for they close down their chartering sector when they are quite well known for their charter services, especially for big events? they just need to improve on their services like introducing school bus service.</p>

              <p>When single rigids can't work, you can get more double deckers.</p>
