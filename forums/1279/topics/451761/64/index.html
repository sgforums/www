              <p><br>They charge less bacause they are keen to clitch the business to make the profits but at the expense of dwindling service standards for basic public bus services.</p>

              <p>Not 100% but at least a mixture of SD/DDs in the fleet~ You can say there's elderly going up, but how sure is that? We both seen different cases, I can say majority of the elderly prefer lower deck. The more seats there is, the better it is~ I often heard elderly complaining about less seats in the bus(those KUB)~ </p>
              <p>I'm ain't sure about HK~ But all I see aren't elderly onboard any DDs on the 2nd deck~~ Plus you can never compare HK's KMB and Singapore's SBSTransit for DDs.</p>
              <p>Their DDs have a safer steps, unlike our Singapore, which have a "spiral-staircase" like. There's also more space, and it shows a mini version of those found in a 2-story flat~ Infact, I admire more of HK bus company than our locals one~ </p>
              <p>Don't just say SMRT, some SBST drivers aren't probably trained~ Infact, I guess LTA should look into it seriously~ Don't say these 2 company, some private company buses do speeds, used road shoulder to kill waiting time for jam~ I've seen SBST drivers using the middle lane at least 80-90% tru-out the entire journey too. So does the issue lies on poor training from "upstairs"(aka trainer) or drive too long turn reckless? </p>

Of course, sometimes we can't blame the BCs because of SMRTB terrible scheduling which cause BCs to have tight runtimes. It shows how much the company culture is.</p>

              <p>That is why speeding should never been allowed for public buses
              and should be enforced for the safety for the commuters. Especially
              for SMRT buses and bendy buses, which overworking them leads to

              <p>You will never realised how dangerous a speeding heavy vehicle will be until you drive. I drove on expressways, normally at speeds around 90km/h and I can see these large dumper trucks travelling almost the same speed as I am but once they are beside you, you will feel how dangerous it is beside them.</p>
              <p>Because accidents can happen in a moment and crashing with these large vehicles, even side by side, means nasty business.</p>

              first, and some even beat the red lights. Of course, sometimes we
              can't blame the BCs because of SMRTB terrible scheduling which
              cause BCs to have tight runtimes. It shows how much the company

              <p>You will never realised how dangerous a speeding heavy vehicle
              will be until you drive. I drove on expressways, normally at speeds
              around 90km/h and I can see these large dumper trucks
              travelling almost the same speed as I am but once they are beside
              you, you will feel how dangerous it is beside them.</p>
              <p>Because accidents can happen in a moment and crashing with these
              large vehicles, even side by side, means nasty business.</p>

              you said middle lane... 
              
              Road shoulder part that one can go complain, KUB/ Citaro have CCTV onboard... it's very clear cut when e bus ply on the road shoulder...
              
              Middle lane.. so like 985 keep on middle lane during PM peak to avoid the BKE form up slow movement is not allowed??? then what's defensive driving for?

              <p>The bus roars alot when its overworked, needs to be tuned
              properly. When the engines at a very high speed the engine will be
              hotter so the radiator will roar</p>

              <p>Yes the roaring of those CDGEs, especially those on 88 are roaring very loudly when leaving the bus stop... But BRBP's CDGEs and HGDEP's CDGEs have their air-con well maintained though, as cold as a Wright's. I have not yet taken a SLBP's CDGE though, so I don't know.</p>
