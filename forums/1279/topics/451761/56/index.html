              <p>Cannot both la bro..It's either they prefer bendies or DDs.But seriously let see what STK will offer them next year shall we?No point bitching here flame war.Keyboard warrior let alone hoilier than thou attitude here.If SMRT chose bendy then we respect their decision.Like I said before no point argue cause this is just a bus forum where bus fans gain knowledge about buses afterall.Seriously I dun give a hoot whether they chose bendy or DDs cause its their choice and their $$$$$$$.For me got good buses no need wait long2 happy Liao.Period Kwang Kwang Kwang.</p>

              many of your know nuts about driving, so what your know abt traffic light timing adjustment?
              
              many of your may not have observed bus ops during the peak within peak, peak hours.... so how your know the boarding situation at BPJ...
              
              many of your have never seen the era w/o MRT, bus lane flooded by 10m, 11m SBS buses in the CBD.. From Chinatown all the way to Bugis..
              
              Many of your have never seen the days...
              
              Hahahaha...

              sometimes all it takes is just to give a little more green light makes the trick...
              
              need me say more abt the CCK/ BPJ/ WDL/ Upp Bt Timah Rd junction?
              
              The CCK Rd all along have been a 2 lane road, it's only reaching the junction or aft the LRT viaduct intersection that it becomes 4 lane...
              
              and as far as I believe in the past, the red light occurs very fast because the sensor was given a false reading that there's little traffic alrdy...
              
              false because how fast the vehicles from the 2 lane carriageway be able to flood up the 4 lane carriageway's capacity?
              
              Many a times they rely too much on the sensors, the traffic engineers never go down and do a check until ppl go complain...

              <p>You can't simply throw a full fleet rigid during weekdays when you never really see it yourself. The jam at Checkpoint often cause during weekdays evening time, do you really think everything is so smooth like SBS Transit svc meh? No please~ If SMRT would to think the way you think, I believe they will soon close gate liao~  </p>
              <p>How do you keep it stable when you have a jam source on a certain part of the route? This isn't SBS leh..You say until it's so easy, why not you try driving? See if your idea works or not~</p>
              <p>Svc912/913 have not much issue due to full fleet bendy, regardless of the headways being irregular, they still can somewhat cope with it. Cause they are almost full bendy fleet, the capacity is there. </p>
              <p>During peak hours, the 911E are somewhat mixed inbetween 911s. You can never expect the 911 buses to be all on time, don't forget those buses returned from CIQ area, and you should somewhat know about there, don't you? </p>

              <p>You really think they so "follow law" meh? Downroutes from CWs/170 have been spotted using Wdl Centre Rd, don't say them, some Malaysian Lorries also. Don't forget those coming out from the Checkpoint, there's usually a long queue at Woodlands Centre Rd on certain days, it's unpredictable. </p>
              <p>So how the hell do you think you can manage the timing well? Pull over is it? -.-" </p>
              <p>At least 1-2 bendy for weekdays with rigids is somewhat reasonable, at least SMRT knows that it's always stand-by for any jams. If you deploy full rigids like weekends(where there's lesser jams on weekends), it's totally a hell.</p>
