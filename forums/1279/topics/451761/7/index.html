              <p><br> Grow up and stop behaving like a bullying kid.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>In the first place, I am not even interested in your "smart"
                  idea, because I know it will never happen. So why should I "game
                  enough" to go with your "smart idea" in the first place? You
                  suggested it since you think it can help me solve the problem.
                  Fine, you go write the letter because I won't do such a thing that
                  will not work. If you wrote the email to them and they agree,
                  please let the whole world know, you win, your idea works. If this
                  "smart" idea can work, everyone can be the CEO of SMRT because
                  everyone is very unhappy with SMRT way of managing their services
                  and the kind of screwed service they rendered for them all these
                  years.</li>
              <li> I know complaining here won't change anything but at
                  least I share on my past bad experiences on how badly they managed
                  their own customers feedbacks and complaints. Before I even joined
                  this forum, I had done my part to feedback and complain on the
                  aspects that SMRT failed to fulfill since they absorbed TIBS.
                  Despite years of complains, incidents, they refused to listen, take
                  their own sweet time to improve but yet keep on increasing fares
                  every year which is not justifiable for their service standards.
                  Even in the mainstream media, despite complains and incidents
                  report, nothing much improved. They continued their way of doing
                  things, neglecting the basics of providing a good service while
                  concentrating paying fat profits to their shareholders. Look now,
                  what happened, operations failed badly, profits dropped, share
                  price tumbled, can of worms finally opened. That has already a
                  fact, only you yourself keeps on denying with false information and
                  your own fiction.</li>
              <li>Your earlier arguements in this thread has already shown that
                  you just want to win arguements, using lame factless claims to keep
                  on supporting your nonsense, acting like you are some big shot here
                  demanding "official" news for prove to you, while many of these
                  people are telling you nicely what is actually the most likely
                  scenario.</li>
              <li> Can't compare because of differences in what way? Land is
                  bigger, thus some companies are bigger, yet they can manage well.
                  SMRT is relatively very small as compared to them and yet it failed
                  so badly. If such a small company is managed so badly, then there
                  is something very wrong with the company structure, the mangement.
                  Even in the recent news, it has already said that SMRT don't even
                  have a standard proper SOP for major train disruptions. So what
                  does it tell you?</li>
              <li>Lastly back to the first point again. Who do you think you are
                  to judge me then? Who are you to tell me to be the CEO of SMRT when
                  I complain about them? Don't act like you know everything and try
                  to act like a big shot here, demanding this and that which can
                  solve your solution. I don't want to challenge your childish act of
                  challenging me a flame war like those kids previously.</li>
              <li>Mr carbikebus and other bus fans are right, you are the real
                  joker making a fool out of yourself time after time here. My last
                  advice for you: Stop acting like a big shot here demanding this and
                  that here, you don't believe then it's your own business, don't
                  stop people from sharing information here. If you can't give
                  sustainable solutions, then just keep quiet and see how others do
                  it. Giving pointers like "since you are so smart, you go do it" but
                  you yourself can't even do it, shows you are a NATO only. I rest my
                  case.</li>

              <p>I NATOed. Alright. But I managed to live with it. Can you? You cant.</p>
              <p>All these complaining and whining doesn't help. Infact they still stayed the same. No change at all. What's beyond their control and what's not, These people will see for themselves. </p>
              <p>One thing, either you live with things, or you can keep bitching about it and it never changes.</p>

              Scaffoldings are already erected around the shophouses and
              construction vehicles are inside there for weeks already. I think
              they are going to announce building a new temp interchange for

              <p><br>You think land in Singapore is cheap??? The depot might expand a bit in size but definate not a lot for the sake of parking the bendies.
