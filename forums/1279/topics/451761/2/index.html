              <p>It's not true.</p>
              <p>Why SMRT can't buy double deckers? They should change to double
              deckers so that their operations will be smoother, more buses can
              be parked inside the depot, and less jams and queues in bus
              interchanges. SMRT bus services is so messed up now, and these long
              buses are partially the reason behind it. SMRT has to be practical
              on its operations and use the kind of buses that don't give them so
              much problems which yet offer them a chance to improve their
              services, not fanciful thoughts of trying to be different which in
              the end become worse in which what they are in now.</p>
              <p>And if LTA wants to put more buses on the roads, then please get
              rid of all the bendies or else there will be many problems with
              long bus queues, jams along bus stops, interchanges, etc. Hong Kong
              bus system is successful in such a populated city, fast and
              efficient. We should look into practical ways to improve our bus
              system, not buy these road hogging buses for the sake of having
              them.</p>
              <p>In fact, double deckers are more easier to control than bendies
              because they are the same length of single deckers. Bendies are
              hard to reverse, sharp turns, U-turns. The thing being different
              driving a double decker from a single decker is just have to be
              careful and slow down on turns and be wary of low height areas (if
              stick to the route, then there is no problem at all). Thus it is
              easier to train BCs. Training all BCs to drive these big capacity
              buses does not happen overnight. SMRT can still train
              them batch by batch, as SMRT buys new double deckers batch by
              batch to replace the bendies scrapped batch by batch.</p>
              <p>Isn't it the same as what SBST and SMRT train their BCs to drive
              WAB buses 4 years back? It can be done.</p>
              <p>So, SMRT can still change to double deckers and ditch
              bendies for good. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

This isSingapore style of doing things.Looks like your cannot see far either.Cannot accept SMRT for who they are? Eh, are they e regulators?So LTA or SMRT bigger over just is bendies ok on the road?Kids                          I have no say over the infra here, But I managed to live with it. Did you? I dont think you do right? Some of the things I dont see fit I've learnt to keep quiet. Only people like you would make noise over it and complain.</span></span></p>

              <p>Express yourself in a different manner by calling others a kid??? If that is your way to express your views, then you better reflect on what you have said. I am just sharing my views on what is happening now and in future and whatever that I know, but you deliberately want to stir things up with these and not accepting what is happening around you. Things are changing now and for the future and you are still behaving like a brat here to keep on insisting SMRT should use bendies where it is not going to be feasible in future.</p>
              <p>Btw, SMRT has already expressed their interest in switching to double deckers before. That was in their minds for quite some time and that was what they actually hoped to achieve in long run. Bendies are not their purchase at all. It was TIBS. So respect their decisions, will you???</p>
              <p>Seriously get a life and go and open your eyes to observe what is actually happening.</p>

              <p>Express yourself in a different manner by calling others a
              kid??? If that is your way to express your views, then you better
              reflect on what you have said. I am just sharing my views on what
              is happening now and in future and whatever that I know, but you
              deliberately want to stir things up with these and not accepting
              what is happening around you. Things are changing now and for the
              future and you are still behaving like a brat here to keep on
              insisting SMRT should use bendies where it is not going to be
              feasible in future.</p>
              <p>Btw, SMRT has already expressed their interest in switching to
              double deckers before. That was in their minds for quite some time
              and that was what they actually hoped to achieve in long run.
              Bendies are not their purchase at all. It was TIBS. So respect
              their decisions, will you???</p>
              <p>Seriously get a life and go and open your eyes to observe what
              is actually happening.</p>

              <p>Really, you missed my whole point. I called you a kid back in my previous post because it seems that it coming out of your mouth and it is not official. You fabricated this whole thing. Yes, Things do change and I might not see bendies near future. I don't deny bendies are taking up space but the company itself wants to by that style of bus. What can you say? You can't stop SMRT for buying the style of buses they like do you? Up till now it still hasn't been made official that they are getting double deckers - Even if they expressed their interest before. Whatever the outcome, I'll respect it. Right from the start it was you who fabricated about bendies being banned, and all these nonsense. 'Your LTA friend here and there' Which hasn't been made official. LTA people will see and assess the situation whether or not they will let this kind of vehicle on our roads. They aren't fools and they can see for themseves. </p>

              <p>I share on what I have heard from my source. If you do not believe and accept any facts, you do not have to criticise others. It makes you look very petty here.</p>
              <p>Like what I have said before, LTA and transport operators do not have to make official on every decision that they make to the public. They do not have to answer everything that they do which do not have much impact to the public. I had quoted many examples previously. You can insist you want official statements but LTA nor the bus operators are not going to tell you anything like what they had done things in the past and they don't see the need to. They just implement it gradually when the decision is made. Likewise for SMRT, they wanted to switch to double deckers because of operating issues.</p>

              <p>Smrt cant operate dds because their infrastructure is not ready to accept dds yet, not because their SLs needs to be trained. If you can drive an articulated vehicle and reverse it properly, there's pretty much nothing that you need more training to drive. </p>

              <p>I'm not petty but seems like you are acting like 'an authorative figure' here, claiming you have heard from 'your source' here and there, Which is ficitious in the first place. Your point here isnt even 'strong enough' to prove me wrong. Even if they didn't make it official they can twist and bend the rules anytime they want to. To me you are just another bendy hater who forces SMRT to switch to double decks and implement it on the spot. I do accept facts only if they are made official and not the fictious ones you've made. You can't give official statements don't try to act authority here.</p>
