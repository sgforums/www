              179 ar..
              
              morning peak ops lor... 179A headways can stretch all the way to 8 mins one... though e-guide stipulated 2 - 4 mins...
              
              179 bo taiji...
              
              so end up lots of ppl queue for 179 since SLBP only bother to dispatch 179 properly... end up at times a 179 is macham 179A, packed from BNL and heck care to stop along the way...
              
              Ends up by some time, there's a lot of passengers unable to board 179 along the way...
              
              I've always been wondering... 199's avg load is abt 30 - 40% during the same period but why SLBP never say dun operate the 243 crossover to increase capacity factor???
              
              But why 179A they dun want to dispatch? End up 199 can be faster than 179A to get to NTU...

              179 is a joke one la...
              
              179A desto buses operating as 179 one...
              
              Ever once SLBP starter threw all 179A trips to become 179 in the evening... BC told me they dun want to operate 179A... so dun dispatch...
              
              You see.... 
              
              Dun forget LTA &amp; PTC do have 179 &amp; 179A's timetable... anyhow operating buses has comsequences once ppl begins to complain abt buses being underoperated etc...

              <p>Agreed. With the highest number of routes, Boon Lay is still better managed than Yishun and Woodlands. As you correctly said, if it was replaced with bendies, god only knows what would happen!!</p>

              <p>I agree bendies are good for feeder routes, and hence the existing bendies can continue on Yishun, Woodlands, CCK feeders / intra-towns.</p>
              <p>Having said that DDs have shown to get very well utilized on feeders too. Have you checked out a 334 at Jurong? One bus takes away the load of 2 SDs. Or for that matter 222, 291 townlinks. </p>
              <p>Take 225 as an example. Total loop route has only 6 stops, yet DD upper deck has around 40 pax while the lower deck has around 30. </p>

              <p>I'm sorry.</p>
              <p>I thought your post would be objective.</p>
              <p>It turned out to be factually wrong and just plain sitting on
                  the fence which just puts you in bad light with the said
                  company!</p>
              <p>SBST is not godly.</p>
              <p>But I hardly heard of people saying SBST ignores feedback (SMRT
                  raised the heckles of the public years ago, ignoring complaints),
                  and to the public, SBST has been doing a brilliant fleet
                  replacement job.</p>
              <p>As for manteinance, don't kid yourself. I can safely say that
                  SBST buses do have <em>better</em> mainteinance. This is a
                  fact. Not an opinion. If you wanna prove me wrong, then you gotta
                  nit-pick, which makes you no better than the people you lampooned.
                  Frequency also. Don't kid yourself. In general I don't have as many
                  problems with SBST than with SMRT. Again, if you wanna prove me
                  wrong, you'll have to nit-pick on say....156, 163 etc. </p>
              <p>And only to some of you guys, SBST buys "terrible buses"! To me,
                  the fleet replacement exercise has brought a pleasant fresh breath
                  to the fleet.</p>

              <p>i can tell u there are at least 2 pieces of evidence that can

              <p>anyways, no company is perfect</p>
              <p>true enuf, smrt is terrible at maintanence </p>
              <p>but that doesnt mean the other company, sbs transit is godly</p>
              <p>their maintanence is also sucky, just as terrible as smrt</p>
              <p>their frequencies and reliability of bus is just as bad as smrt
              also</p>
              <p>and who say certain sbst bus dont drive recklessly, just as
              certain smrt buses do</p>
              <p>smrt scheduling problematic? same goes to sbst. u dun tell me
              that u dun see sbst bus trying to chiong to catch up with their

              <p>then smrt one is becos is tight?</p>
              <p>actually i know the real names of most whiners here</p>

              <p>It's just that some whiners who always nit-pick on stuff <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DO NOT EVEN</span></span></strong> see the good points of bendies.</p>
              <p>You try deploying DD on 806, see how long it takes for people to alight? They say use bendy delay bus stop for 5min, use DD also same case, slow unloading also delay bus stop for 5min. Makes no difference. </p>
              <p>However, I am completely fine with SMRT buying DDs, it's just a matter of fact to deploy them on the right services. Deploy DDs on 190 and 106 would be the best. Deploy bendies on feeders. If you deploy them on feeders <strong>ONLY</strong>, that would reduce the number of bendies to 50 or 100 as in an acceptable level, the main problem now is CBD, but 67, 171, 700 and 960 cannot deploy DDs due to Dunearn Rd and 67, 700 and 960 have no choice but to use bendies due to High Loading and those low trees along Dunearn Rd.</p>
              <p>Stop whining, people... Just accept them for who they are... I beg all of you... I ALSO GIVE DDS PROS AND I NEVER EVER SAID THAT DDS ARE BAD.</p>

              <p>Even if the bendy bus take 1 to 2 min faster to unload, then you have to think how much space it takes up to do the unloading and even loading?</p>
              <p>Point is the bendy bus takes up 2 bus spaces to do its alighting and boarding of passengers, while double deckers only need one bus space along the bus bay/lane. Even if both takes the same time to do its alighting and boarding of passengers, the double decker uses only one bus space to do it, which the other space behind can be better and more efficiently used by another bus (of another service) to do its alighting and boarding of passengers.</p>
              <p>If these high capacity buses takes a longer time again in the bus stop, the bus behind can at least move out of the bus bay/lane and let another bus come in again for its alighting and boarding of passengers. But bendy bus, which takes up the space of the whole bus stop, can only cause long queues of buses behind because they can't move into the bus bay/lane in a safe position beside the bus stop to alighting and boarding of passengers. This causes delay to other buses and other bus services behind the queue. The situation is made worse when it rains or when there are PIW passengers in the buses behind. </p>
              <p>I believe feeders can do with single deckers with better frequencies or introducing new services to ease the load along its route partially. As for Northwest routes, there is no need for bendy buses once DTL is ready in a few years time. Low tree trunk issues should be highlighted to LTA and NEA and it is up to them whether they want to improve Singapore public transport system.</p>
              <p>Be practical. Bendy buses are not useful anymore as our population increases, becomes denser, and given our demanding bus operating environments, limited bus infrastructures, and heavy traffic road conditions. Plus we are adding more buses and more bus services in future. We won't want queues of buses everywhere and deprive the efficiency of the bus system further. If SMRTB has to stop using bendy buses to further improve the bus system, it is certainly worth it for the company.</p>

              <p>Not in all cases. Some bendy buses do not have standees in the back trailer part other than in front of the 2 3rd doors, and sometimes not even fully seated. Most of the time the front is fully cramped and not many moved to the back, unless in the worst case BC keep on telling them to move in. </p>
              <p>I have noticed and observed the bus stop you mentioned. Most of the times it will be plied up by buses especially bendy buses that contrbutes much of the long queues, especially during peak hours.Some buses can't even allow their passengers to alight and board because of their in 2nd lane or stop in places not safe along the bus lane, or in front of the exit of Yishun Bus interchange.</p>

              <p>yes. but thats when you see at least 1 bendy on trunk service.</p>
              <p>shouldnt those feeders just go into Yishun Bus Interchange? first bus stop leads to Northpoint and another to Blk 923.</p>

              <p>For me, the fastest DDs are the Leylands and some Batch 1 ZF Wrights...</p>
              <p>VSO is damn slow, some Tridents on 89 are chiongsters, CDGEs have average speed, Batch 2A Wrights have avg speed, Batch 2B Wrights are super slow. SBS7888K i dunno... VO3X and VO2X also quite slow...</p>
