              <p>Problem is depot space,Our land and worst of all you cant stop ppl from buying cars.</p>
              <p>Aussie is different,Their car drivers sometimes will park their car and take buses to work.Im not againts bendy but future infrastructure indirectly picture that BI are all too crowded to have bendy buses parking.SMRT also in dilemma to buy or not.I acknowledge that short haul is good for bendy but again our land is too small compared Hong Kong which is nearly double the size of our land.</p>

              <p><br>If LTA is serious about improving public transport, it's worthwhile. If not, that means they are only talking without actions. Low tree branches are also a road hazard for big commercial trucks as well.</p>
              <p>LTA cut down countless of trees in the past for MRT lines before.</p>

              <p>SBS's intentions to build the guided bus system wasn't materialised by LTA back then. This lead to the problems we have now.</p>
              <p>Bus interchange/terminals/depots will still be jammed and bottled neck if there are too many buses inside, and when bus queues are too long. SMRT Woodlands depot is a very good example.</p>
              <p>Bus interchanges and terminals are meant to be one stop places that allows seamless transfers. If there are too many levels, it makes transferring more time consuming.</p>
