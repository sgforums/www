              cbb... eh... no... 199 can use SD during off peak...

              <p>By the way people comment abt all these planning related stuff,
                  <strong>obviously your cannot </strong>think of how to standardise, how to be fair
                  to each n every bus sv’s needs…</p>
              <p>Worst thing talk of some places like Sg Kadut having concrete
                  factories, say also either dun want to know or dun wish to know but
                  still want to stubbornly insist Sat not much lorry traffic…</p>
              <p>The only day <span>CIQ</span> have less lorry traffic
                  is on Sunday… Not surprisingly, market stalls most dun open on
                  Monday since there’s no shipment of chicken, vegetables on
                  Sunday…</p>
              <p><span>S911</span>’s case… Still cannot believe not a
                  single 911 appears even w/ 2×856 disparch.. still say is ok… eh.. I
                  thought 911’s freq is 3 – 5 mins??? Ghost buses?</p>
              <p>Woodlands N1 quite a decent chunk are 4 storey walk up flats, N8
                  side abt 70+ blocks of flats… like this cannot cope? is it schedule
                  got problem or is it something else? Woah, then Sv 903, 912 how
                  ar??? bigger catchment area…</p>
              <p>Still want to laugh… like things dun want to take it and think,
                  and really think abt it…</p>
              <p>always<strong> think your know</strong> a lot of things… ask ppl to google abt
                  econs, still say I know la.. keep quiet… I know many here are still
                  in sec sch, poly.. There’s still a lot of things to learn, dun
                  think you’re are very smart…</p>
              <p>Still have not even learn how to drive yet… worst…</p>
              <p><strong>If <span>SMB66X</span> still insist wanting to know who
                  I am… well I can tell u then.. I was the one who feedback-ed to
                  <span>SBST</span> to operate downroutes for 179A in the
                  evening from South Spine, abt possibility of pushing out more ADDs
                  on 502 on weekends…</strong></p>
              <p>People have contacts around, dun need to write each n everything
                  over feedback, planning related issues over here… for next thing,
                  kids later go backstab or want to get more info etc…</p>

              <p>So what if you're the one whom feedback to SBST for 179A? Did anyone even thank you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Stop thinking that your feedback deserves the whole world to know, and the whole world to thank you with some gifts~ It's either you feedback for everyone goods, and shut up afterwards(not go around say "EH this is feedback-ed by me one") or you simply keep quiet and watch~ </p>
              <p>Anyway, mr NTU student arh..type clearly please~ Don't tell me NTU never teach you to type clearly in text? Your "your"~ Don't even suit the sentences <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>And yes the frequency is 3-5mins~ Do you think the time taken for 1 bus to fill to the brim, close door or even take driver to wait, would be 1min plus? Confirm drag uptil 3-5mins or even more~ And by then, obviously the 2nd bus would be waiting at the back~ Boy arh boy, don't forget 912/962 have their pax to deal with. You can never expect much~~ </p>
              <p>Frequency for fleet after 7pm is 3-20mins, do you even think, if the rigid are fitted at 15mins max. frequency each, able to cope the pax? Why 15mins max.? A 7-10mins frequency already show that the queue can be quite long at night already, especially Friday~ Somemore with 6AP running, you can never really expect them to lambat~ By simply putting adding at least 1-2 bendy, not asking you to put 12 Bendy buses in the fleet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Look who is acting like a boss now. Public transport is designed for the efficiency for the country as a whole, but for a group of selfish people like you just to fulfill your fantasies for your utopian bus company. There are limitations, operational efficiencies, costs and viability issues, etc to look into.</p>
              <p>If you don't get my question, let me ask you.</p>
              <p>Do you think that by stopping by further in front of your proposed bus bay, buses won't mount the kerb (the tip between the bus bay and the road) after moving out of the bus bay? And by reducing the gradient of the sloping line, won't it be harder for BCs to drive the bus out to the road because it is harder for them to check the blind spots as they gradually move out? Lastly, it won't make a difference if it is designed this way. LTA will be much happier to park 2 standard length buses instead but no, they choose not to do so and why? Because of safety issues.</p>
              <p>Some bus stops have such narrow gradients because the area is smaller for a longer bus bay. One recent example is the bus stop opposite Khoo Teck Phuat hospital, outside BLK 652, Yishun Central. The bus bay length has been reduced for the vehicular entrance for a new nursing home. I can see it will become a potential road hazard for other road users with the rear trailer of the bendy bus jutting out of the road because of this.</p>

              <p><br>Explain to me roadside parking outside Woodlands depot. If there is no parking crunch, why do buses have to park outside the depots every night? It is more of the headache of the parking attendent to find the appropriate parking for all the buses every night, instead of he/she being meticulous.</p>
              <p>In fact, Mr carbikebus had already said the 3 depots are facing this kind of problems everyday. Still want to hide the facts with your rubbish?</p>

              <p>When I say as a whole it means everyone. It seems that you are the only one leaving the elderly out. You are only assuming based on your thoughts. You never seen how eager or healthy our elderly population just to get a seat or just to get out of the view of a crowded bus. And look at how the younger generations behave when they see the elderly, pretending to sleep, laziness to move up, etc. Your point of view is simply too myopic to say that PIWs can only need to wait longer for an SD bus. Higher frequenices are there for a reason and double deckers can do the same job.</p>
              <p>If you really have the heart for more seats for the elderly, then stop your large groups of bus joyriding and make a fool of yourselves in the bus and at the same time, creating nuisance to other bus commuters and depriving the seats of other bus commuters.</p>

I did not say anything much about the bus in the bus bay but moving out of the bus bay. And do you know about turning out into a road and checking blind spots? Stopping a bit forward, do you think most BCs will do that for the sake of doing? And when it rains, would they stop by the bus shelter or move out of the shelter to allow boarding? </p>

              <p>"If 70% of Singaporeas in future faces leg problem.." &lt; How are you going to have more DDs when they have leg problem? You're seriously making them injure more when they headed up~ And are you sure those are young generation people only? It's more of those 20s-30s people please~ Do you think every WAB svc have DDs~~? Even with DD, there's time where they have to skip that DD for the next bus too? So how sure are you that they aren't gonna be waiting? And don't be an ass by putting the word longer~ You've totally change the story~</p>
              <p>Wow? "My" large group of bus joyridings? Oh please~ You're talking to the wrong person~~ </p>
              <p>If the SLs/BCs have been trained, I see no reason for them not checking~~ It's only a minor few of them not checking while leaving~ Like I've said, the bus bay must be slightly bigger, as when the bus move, the car can have some time to react or at least horn/stop~</p>
