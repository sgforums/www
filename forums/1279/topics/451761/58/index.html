              <p>SBS1000U is an adult without having his mind matured, so he scolds people everytime without a valid reason and implements his hatred on buses, complaint this complaint that just for 1 reason, without having his mind matured. You can compare the level of his childish behaviour to Ho Jun Yi, similar. Plus I suspect that SBS1000U quitted his SBS1000U account and cloned another account called Jason Lim WD to start a flamewar in this forum.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, your suggestion might seems right to you, same for others. But do you think it's right for everyone? By saying everyone includes people whom commutes daily~ It's not based on your long term experience in buses, it's by the reality. Last time you study more about linking and answering from a long text(comprehension), now you study more about inferring from a conversation. It's a change. Your old skills can never last you for the entire life, it got to be upgraded~ </p>
              <p>There can be quarrel when both don't agree on each term~ It's normal for a forum isn't it? If not, what's the use of a forum? Just to post and share? No~ It's meant for small learning and knowing your stand of certain issues is right or wrong. </p>

              <p>Yes I agree, but with our newer generation nowadays, do you think those younger ones would? Don't forget the people around us, some of them don't and they aren't even falling under the younger generation group. Sometimes, we should see it in a real life picture. Not all things are what we think it would happen.</p>
              <p>As for the leg issue, half of Singaporeans are more of "only do when asked" type. They tend to think it's alright for them to do, and totally forget about others. When the elderly don't move, the 2nd person can still move to the rear isn't it?</p>
              <p>That's Singaporean style, not just the elderly. We tend to be "afraid" of unable to alight the bus/trains, why? Bus drivers didn't check and wait longer, train have a time to catch up, and these are why the doors are closed early. Not only that, we Singaporeans tend to be lazy too~ Some are needed to be shout at, or even get commented at, then we move. This are all the habits that would mostly caused an issue of delaying~~</p>

              <p>It's not a matter of correct or not. It is a matter of the feasibility given on the constraints Singapore is facing now. It is about being realistic and solving the problem, which is seen everyday, as much as we can and not to elevate or ignoring it.</p>
              <p>Problem is SMRT is already chaotic inside and its problems are finally seen because of its years of inefficiency and their failure in their managing style. Only time will tell if they want to improve, or just another NATO. If that is really the way they still want to operate, then I have to agree with vicamour.</p>
              <p>It doesn't really matter who operates the buses, as long as there are no long bus queues and delays, not many fare increase, etc. So if SBST one day really takes over all the bus services from SMRT, the public would also won't care less.</p>

              <p>Probably not, it's just to facilitate for more WAB buses (Of course I know it's not a WAB service yet). But given that there are no WAB bendies yet, they will have to resort to deploying SDs instead.</p>
              <p>And during the peak hours, this is what you will end up with onboard a 960 SD. Not this bus alone, just expect this to be a common sight.</p>
