                  and HGDEP's CDGEs have their air-con well maintained though, as

              <p><br>Not true. At least they don't hog the lanes when they are driving slowly along the road shoulder and decides later to drive faster when they are in schedule and turns back into the normal car lane. You can't drive at the road shoulder at normal speeds without valid as it is illegal.</p>
              <p>You are just assuming. If the demand is very high and the current buses cannot cope, they will deploy double decker buses. It is a matter of their systematic planning.</p>
