              I'll still say this. 
              
              Go around and look at the infrastructure. You live with it. 
              
              Also your still dun get what I'm saying. Here govt dun need to say anything, they just plan without allowance for bendies. 
              
              Not to say we standardise things, ie layout of BI. So it's not surprising of how the new BI are built. 
              
              Even the BNL, it's built just to accommodate the bendies, but if you look closely the span is similiar to the layover pt for the 12m buses.

              No one hates the bendies to the core. But SBS's experience tells it so with the info I get. 
              
              And no it's not what 2656 said. More of planning issues. 
              
              I'll leave it this way, when your infrastructure planning and road layout dun allow for long buses, the actual use only helps to you find out whether is it true or not. 
              
              Not to say seeing on Mon night, 4 bendies and 1 SD of 190 flooding the RTC bus stop. Lucky there wasn't SBS buses from Dunearn Rd, else everyone dun need to move for that cycle. That's really jam.  You live with the constrains and not challenge it.

              <p>I'm not petty but seems like you are acting like 'an authorative
              figure' here, claiming you have heard from 'your source' here and
              there, Which is ficitious in the first place. Your point here isnt
              even 'strong enough' to prove me wrong. Even if they didn't make it
              official they can twist and bend the rules anytime they want to. To
              me you are just another bendy hater who forces SMRT to switch to
              double decks and implement it on the spot. I do accept facts only
              if they are made official and not the fictious ones you've made.
              You can't give official statements don't try to act authority

              <p>Like what I had said before, if you don't believe, that is your own problem. I don't have to force you to believe. I think you are the one who is acting authoritative here, refusing to let other views being shared here and only insist that what you think and what you like can only be posted here in your favor.</p>
              <p>My points here are good enough to sustain my claims, infrastrutural developments, future fleet increments, other road users' complains on these long vehicles, other BCs' complains as well, even SMRT itself has already considering switching to double deckers, LTA's future developments and past lessons of long bus queues; it is just you who still don't see the big picture.</p>
              <p>And stop acting like you are the head of LTA or minister of transport to demand every news to be made official to you. Such decisions will not be made official to the public and there is no need for LTA and transport operators to do so.</p>

              <p>I am not very sure about the training part but I guess it is not that difficult to drive a double decker since they have the same length as single deckers. Just that they need to be more careful on sharp turns. Route for double deckers are already pre planned and so should be no problems as long as BCs stick to their routes. </p>
              <p>I believe the major obstacle is the depot, which I hope the new one for SMRT can accommodate double deckers. <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></span></p>

              I believe SMRT would benefit from increased productivity and maybe even enjoy slight reduction of cost overheads by buying some ADDs. I think 2 ADDs can replace 3 SD regular buses, hence cutting down manpower which is getting difficult to find and retain. And I believe ADDs can carry more passengers than bendies during peak hours. Also, there are many more seats onboard ADDs hence gaining more commuter satisfaction. I remember when sv190 was handed over to Tibs, people started writing to ST Forums to complain there's no more DDs and now got to stand onboard Tibs buses. If SMRT were to stick to the principle of using SD regulars for entire fleet, then LTA should prepare to allocate more parking bays at the future SMRT controlled new bus interchanges. Maybe up to 4-5 parking lots per high demand route! And also LTA should prepare to have more Alighting Bays! Also, are bendies prone to more maintenance problems than ADDs? The bus operators will understand.

              <p>Well, you have mentioned a good and valid point. SMRT do need ADDs on some of their higher capacity routes, and this is very well a fact. This is especially so for routes like 969, 851, 190 that do not have high turnover of passengers.</p>
              <p>However, lets see this from a slightly different perspective. Firstly, their depots are designed to support single decks all along, this is a problem. Money would have to be invested into new equipment (e.g. automatic washer, higher loading vehicle lifts/jacks, maintenance bays to accomodate the higher vehicles, etc). But this is kind of money must be spent to improve service, and should not be a deterrent.</p>
              <p>However, the issue comes in with regards to what ADDs can they purchase. In order to have a good cost saving, they should get DDs that shares components with their SDs unless its going to be a huge fleet. This naturally points to Mercedes Benz and MAN. MB stopped producing chassis available for full size double decks after the O305. As for MAN, their integral DD (the big yellow ones you can find in wiki) are firstly not available for RHD markets, are too long (14m), and costs a bomb (nearly 800k each vs. 550k for the b9tl). As for chassis, im not sure if they still produced any, but the ones used by KMB are rather dissapointing in performance. Remaining few manufactuers who produce 3 axle DDs are Volvo, AlexanderDennis and Scania. Volvo B9TL are good, but the links with cdge as distributor might be an issue. As for the other two, they are still relatively unproven here and will cause a overhead on mechanics training and procurement of spare parts. To add on to this, they still need to call for tender and see whos willing to bid for it. Buying a bus is not as easy as going to a shop and throwing money at the cashier!</p>

              The bus network will still grow because of new demand. 
              
              The MRT will only serve the main corridor and many would realise many ppl take MRT for a few reasons. 
              
              Thinking bus is less frequent but in some cases taking MRT incur distance fare and may even incur longer time in reality.

              <p>With downtown line coming, operators will have to look at re-organizing the current routes. Buses will still be VERY important because MRTs only connect the main junctions, then you have to use buses to get to your destination.</p>
              <p>In fact with a better organization of bus routes, it can serve many people to use buses for point to point travel. For instance, instead of changing trains and walking long distances in an MRT station, if a direct bus serves two points, it is more convenient, even if the travel time &gt; 10-20 mins.</p>
              <p>The advantages are point to point transfer, comfortable with high probability of getting a seat compared to MRT and reduced walking at MRTs. This is critical while going to work.</p>
              <p>So I feel using more big buses will be beneficial to give comfortable journey to passengers. If SDs are operated on long routes, passengers will further be demotivated to take buses with the fear of not getting a seat.</p>
              <p>Just my thoughts!</p>
