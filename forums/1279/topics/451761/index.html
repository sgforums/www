            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think it is high time SMRT needs to deploy Double Deckers on its route. The bendy buses can be kept in the regional Woodlands, CCK, Bukit Panjang area but it should not be plied in main city area like Orchard road. The bendy buses causes queuing of buses and it is rather better to have double deckers deployed especially on routes 190 and 106. Your thoughts?</p></div>

              <p>Stop dreaming about citaro Gs. <br>SBST is FIXED to ONLY have SD that is NON ARTICULATED and DDs that IS NOT ARTICULATED ALSO.<br>SMRT is also only using SD AND SD THAT ARE ARTICULATED. IF SMRT USE DDS, THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR A MAJOR SMRT OVERHAUL FOR BCS TO TRAIN TO USE DDS. <br>It will take 2 - 9 months for ALL BCs to be able to drive DDs as DDs are harder to control. So, SMRT will STICK to articulated and single decks, DDs-free.<br><br>Also the SAME OLD REASON why USA is NOT WILLING to change it's MEASUREMENTS to be the SAME as the rest. It CONTINUES to use the old units like inches, yards, fluid ounces and so on. Because to change, the government need to play MILLIONS of dollars - just to change.<br><br>So you get it? If SMRT were to use DDs, they would need to let all their BC to train to use it.</p>

              <p>I think it is high time SMRT needs to deploy Double Deckers on its route. The bendy buses can be kept in the regional Woodlands, CCK, Bukit Panjang area but it should not be plied in main city area like Orchard road. The bendy buses causes queuing of buses and it is rather better to have double deckers deployed especially on routes 190 and 106. Your thoughts?</p>

              <p>In fact, double deckers are more easier to control than bendies because they are the same length of single deckers. Bendies are hard to reverse, sharp turns, U-turns.

Thus it is easier to train BCs. Training all BCs to drive these big capacity buses does not happen overnight.

              <p>Isn't it the same as what SBST and SMRT train their BCs to drive WAB buses 4 years back? It can be done.</p>
              <p>So, SMRT can still change to double deckers and ditch bendies for good. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              Dear 2656, 
              
              It's not that SBS dunno how to drive. And I'm not going to provide info as to why even if I know, because they're privileged info. 
              
              In fact the bus stop issue I'm giving is alrdy a hint. Saw Pending Rd, CC bus stop. The pedestrian crossing wun allow any bendy + SD together, but SMRT drivers love to block the line because of the car park yellow box. Pwned. 
              
              Why kids still dun get it's not bus company that prefer ADD, it's the infrastructure planning that does not allow it.

              <p>You live within the infrastructure limits, and not start throwing challenges to it.</p>
              <p>like I'll say, LTA dun need to openly say I restrict or ban bendies, I just dun need to plan for them for new BIs.. This is Singapore style of doing things.</p>
              <p>Looks like your cannot see far either.</p>
              <p>Cannot accept SMRT for who they are? Eh, are they e regulators? So LTA or SMRT bigger over just is bendies ok on the road?</p>
