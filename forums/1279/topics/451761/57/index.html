              I think you really know nothing at all... cannot see things beyond the CIQ...
              
              Sg Kadut/ Kranji has quite a no of concrete pre-mix factory, or those pre-fab concrete slab factories... Those M'sian 14 wheelers carrying those sand or rocks many head to that place..
              
              The no that u see would tell you the traffic volume of those 14 wheelers in a day... 
              
              The lorries unload their goods at Woodlands and U-turn back to JB alrdy ar? They've no traces of where they head to locally???
              
              Next thing, Woodlands CIQ's traffic scheme think you also dunno... Even if Woodlands Centre Rd is jammed, that's because there's only 1 lane movable... and no one except school buses and SBS buses can make the right turn into Woodlands CIQ...
              
              It's still movable at every traffic cycle... Jam = totally not movable or poor traffic light timing co-ord.
              
              No wonder why you talk a lot of politics over traffic jam, you obviously know nothing abt the lorries, know nothing abt the traffic scheme.. because I dun have to know, that's the govt's problem...

              as for the CIQ Jam..
              
              Guess before you make the comment further, go stand at Woodlands Rd at the fire station or the new workers dorm area to take a look at the jam before going on to make the comment...
              
              Say Woodlands Centre Rd like that call jam... Go there you'll see why 170 have to be diverted alrdy...

              <p>Anyway, who don't wish to see improvement? Who bothers much about irregular frequency etc.? Nobody would care about that~ As long you give them a good bus, they able to board without waiting for more than 2 buses, they are please~Â </p>
              <p>So in regards to having full SD fleet, I'm totally disagree with that~ You should see during weekdays peak, although the frequency is there, there's ought to have some "inperfect" stuff happening to certain buses, eg. lambat, missed traffic turns or even long waiting time for green light etc. Therefore you can't really rely on fully SD for weekdays, there must be at least 1-2 bendy running to stablize it, be it on 911 or 911E(peak)~Â </p>
              <p>If you're referring to full SD for AP/TQ, there's also a need for at least 1-2 bendy still~ Don't tell me you're just gonna deploy full SD and thinking it's possible to last~ I don't even think SMRT would want that. They rather be "kiasu" than realistic about it~ and there's nothing bad about being "kiasu"~Â </p>
              <p>How about svc964 then? :3~ The frequency during peak hours evening~~</p>

              The no that u see would tell you the traffic volume of those 14
              wheelers in a day... The lorries unload their goods at Woodlands
              and U-turn back to JB alrdy ar? They've no traces of where they
              head to locally??? Next thing, Woodlands CIQ's traffic scheme think
              you also dunno... Even if Woodlands Centre Rd is jammed, that's
              because there's only 1 lane movable... and no one except school
              buses and SBS buses can make the right turn into Woodlands CIQ...
              It's still movable at every traffic cycle... Jam = totally not
              movable or poor traffic light timing co-ord. No wonder why you talk
              a lot of politics over traffic jam, you obviously know nothing abt
              the lorries, know nothing abt the traffic scheme.. because I dun
              have to know, that's the govt's problem... If u dunno who I am, you
              can continue to laugh... cos I dun bother to make feedbacks at
              online forum method as I've direct contacts to pen the feedback/

              <p>SBS1000U is an adult without having his mind matured, so he scolds people everytime without a valid reason and implements his hatred on buses, complaint this complaint that just for 1 reason, without having his mind matured. You can compare the level of his childish behaviour to Ho Jun Yi, similar. Plus I suspect that SBS1000U quitted his SBS1000U account and cloned another account called Jason Lim WD to start a flamewar in this forum.</p>
