              Seriously... They dunno how to aim at all.. when ppl state facts, their legs just go jelly and aim at someone else alrdy...
              
              I still see fallacies... double decks have been on the SG roads since 1977 n till today they're still in use...
              
              For 10 yrs w/o the MRT, they solved a lot of loading problems faced by single decks... 
              
              forget.. it's comments by 8501.. another kid who thinks he knows a lot, and still dun want to read up...

              <p>To put nicely, the interpretation of the DD inclusion in the tender:</p>
              <p>Bendies are recognised by SMRT to be <span style="color: #0000ff;">inadequete</span>.</p>
              <p>To put in a way that the fanboys have yet to comprehend:</p>
              <p>Bendies are recognised to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">failed</span> by way of comparison to DDs.</p>
              <p>Its not the fault of anybody's.</p>
              <p>Its the fact that bendies are not well-suited for SG.</p>
              <p>Considering how fast the major bus operator chucked bendies aside when the chance came, now that was story enough.</p>
              <p>SBST replaced DDs after DDs without fuss.</p>
              <p>Yet when its SMRT's turn to do something about its old bendies, they are dithering and the new bendy is still nowhere in sight. Something is not quite right there.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And if its any operator is in a better position to consider the "fanboy ideal fleet", its SBST, not SMRT. </span></p>
              <p>But of course we know that SBST is not showing the slightest inclination to that sort of fleet, which suggests that including bendies is probably not economical in the long-run.</p>
              <p>Again, not a far stretch of imagination.</p>
              <p>Just some basic logic.</p>

              <p>They used bendies during airshow due to fast board/alighting, suitable for the organiser~ That means you wouldn't be seeing DDs on charter for these type of event(if I m not wrong~). Same goes for MRT Shuttle. </p>

              <p>I am fine if SMRTB still wants to use bendy buses but they must scale down their bus operations by at least 40%. Places like Yishun, Bukit Batok and even Sembawang should be transfered to SBST and SMRTB should only strictly use bendy buses for feeder services (less than 2 km and only between depots and bus interchange) in the other areas they serve (Woodlands, Bukit Panjang and Chua Chu Kang).</p>
              <p>If they want to continue operate bendy buses, they should operate in smaller scales to ensure continuous efficiencies and less delays.</p>
              <p>If they want to continue to operate the 6 areas that they are serving now, they should withdraw bendy buses from the roads and eliminate all the delays and inefficiencies caused by bendy buses all these years, and standardised their fleet length to ensure that planning and scheduling is easier and more systematic.</p>
              <p>Fact is it will be more chaotic on bus lanes and other bus facilities if the number of bendy buses stays at the current level but with more buses and vehicles on the roads given that the population to be increased to 6.5million in near future and even more for the years to come. And it is simply too uneconomical and costly for a bus company to operate a type of high capacity bus but is very limited in numbers due to space constriants in a country while it has to tackle the increasing demand yet with so much constraints in land space.</p>

              <p>thats why SDs with higher freq or bendies are more suitable for feeders. people are not so willing to move up. moving to the rear is much more easier and better, there is always another exit at the rear unlike DDs.<br><br>fyi DDs carry lesser people than bendies... so a full lower deck and half filled upper deck will be like a fully seated bendy with a few standees...</p>

              <p>tell me, who will go up to the upper deck if the ride is just about 10-15min? its not practic putting DDs on feeders which has many facilities along the route or if its short. extending it is not practical either because the extension area demand is prolly low and ypure just wasting fuel not picking up a reasonable amount of passengers.</p>

              <p>That is why speeding should never been allowed for public buses and should be enforced for the safety for the commuters. Especially for SMRT buses and bendy buses, which overworking them leads to those buses burnt or having high accident rates as shown months back.</p>

              <p>Not 100% but at least a mixture of SD/DDs in the fleet~ You can say there's elderly going up, but how sure is that? We both seen different cases, I can say majority of the elderly prefer lower deck. The more seats there is, the better it is~ I often heard elderly complaining about less seats in the bus(those KUB)~ </p>
              <p>I'm ain't sure about HK~ But all I see aren't elderly onboard any DDs on the 2nd deck~~ Plus you can never compare HK's KMB and Singapore's SBSTransit for DDs.</p>
              <p>Their DDs have a safer steps, unlike our Singapore, which have a "spiral-staircase" like. There's also more space, and it shows a mini version of those found in a 2-story flat~ Infact, I admire more of HK bus company than our locals one~ </p>
              <p>Don't just say SMRT, some SBST drivers aren't probably trained~ Infact, I guess LTA should look into it seriously~ Don't say these 2 company, some private company buses do speeds, used road shoulder to kill waiting time for jam~ I've seen SBST drivers using the middle lane at least 80-90% tru-out the entire journey too. So does the issue lies on poor training from "upstairs"(aka trainer) or drive too long turn reckless? </p>
