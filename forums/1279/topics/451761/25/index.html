              <p>i have some concerns about how they maintain their MANs, with missing parts on side mirrors and 'gra gra gra' sounds coming from axle... luckily they are in the minority. definitely much better than the citaros. so much for 'award winning'</p>

              <p>When you consider that SBST controlled Tampines and Bedok with their huge loading that definitely exceeds the North's population density, survived with full SD fleets for those that lack DD......</p>
              <p>The argument just falls apart like match-sticks.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And yes. Feeders like 293 etc also use small roads.</p>
              <p>Say what?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Consider also the fact that SMRT is a significantly smaller competitor.</p>
              <p>If it buys bendies, of course it will use it on trunk routes also. Flexibility with economies of scale to be exploited.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, the main root of problem lies not so much with SMRT's perceived ineptness, but the very real problems of competition in our context. What can SMRT do with the high density areas that shld use high capacity buses?</p>
              <p>The ideal answer would be buy bendies only for feeder, and DD for trunks.</p>
              <p>But you seriously think that is feasible when SMRT has a small market share?</p>
              <p>SBST took the clear step to ditch bendies and it significantly made lives easier for all of us.</p>
              <p>But SMRT?</p>
              <p>Hedging?</p>
              <p>With buses?</p>

              <p>To those who keep calling for variety, flexibility....etc etc</p>
              <p>I suggest you go buy Tamiya buses....one of each type to satisfy that ludicrous desire.</p>
              <p>I have stated why it clearly didnt make sense to have this type and that type already.</p>

              <p>Finally someone talk sense.</p>
              <p>Bus companies operate bus services with good maintanance and scheduling, high efficiencies and reliabilities, not operate for varieties of bus models that does not concern the interest of the commuters at all.</p>

              <p>What I find most disappointing is that SMRT is carrying on TIBS's tradition of having all sorts of hodge-podge fleet.</p>
              <p>They should have learnt that lesson, that having such a fleet makes for mainteinance woes.</p>
              <p>But do you see what they do? Seats must have alternate colour, rims also all kinds of colour.</p>
              <p>Their tender was also the same story!</p>
              <p>Should we have bendy or DD, the contract seems to be asking.</p>
              <p>I do not think SBST is a perfect company. I made a pretty strongly-worded complaint to SBST recently, and though I got 5 complimentary tickets (which I appreciate the gesture), was absolutely unfunny and left me fuming.</p>
              <p>But SBST has in recent years, in particular, taken clear and decisive steps in many aspects. This is particularly true in their fleet renewal exercise. I cannot argue against the potential problem of "locked-in investments" with regards to bulk order of 1-2 types only, but it certainly is a lesser of two evils in the long run when it comes to day-to-day ops.</p>
              <p>Do you order cai png with 6 sides and 3 strands of each type for lunch? I don't. Maybe you like it, but ordering in that manner wastes my time....and money.</p>
              <p>It is easy to blame SMRT management. But we have to remember that being the smaller competitor, it can't really be purchasing in such quantities as SBST.</p>
              <p>BUT</p>

              <p>What I find most disappointing is that SMRT is carrying on TIBS's tradition of having all sorts of hodge-podge fleet.</p>
              <p>They should have learnt that lesson, that having such a fleet makes for mainteinance woes.</p>
              <p>But do you see what they do? Seats must have alternate colour, rims also all kinds of colour.</p>
              <p>Their tender was also the same story!</p>
              <p>Should we have bendy or DD, the contract seems to be asking.</p>
              <p>I do not think SBST is a perfect company. I made a pretty strongly-worded complaint to SBST recently, and though I got 5 complimentary tickets (which I appreciate the gesture), was absolutely unfunny and left me fuming.</p>
              <p>But SBST has in recent years, in particular, taken clear and decisive steps in many aspects. This is particularly true in their fleet renewal exercise. I cannot argue against the potential problem of "locked-in investments" with regards to bulk order of 1-2 types only, but it certainly is a lesser of two evils in the long run when it comes to day-to-day ops.</p>
              <p>Do you order cai png with 6 sides and 3 strands of each type for lunch? I don't. Maybe you like it, but ordering in that manner wastes my time....and money.</p>

              <p>SMRTB past purchasing orders has really been poorly managed by the old management which resulted in really bad state it has now. I agree that as a smaller company, it shouldn't have order so much of different kinds of buses due to smaller scale of operations. It should have just standardise with OC500s and MAN A22s while forsaking Citaros for OC500s instead. Being a smaller company, economies of scales is even more important. More varieties means more different parts to source for and more money to spend and more kinds of skills and personnel to train and spend on. No wonder SMRTB is always in the red these years.</p>
              <p>Now they have changed to a new CEO. I am still accessing his contributions for the company as of now.</p>

              <p>I am of the opinion that "competition" in our context is rubbish.</p>
              <p>A single operator makes more sense for us, the same way that cross-modal transport operators make sense from the POV of streamlining operations.</p>
              <p>Other countries that adopt "competitive tendering" have been more successful because they divide the different regions into zones and tender zone-by-zone. The market is segregated into intra and inter-zonal bus services, and this is how competition is injected.</p>
              <p>SG practically qualifies as a single zone. We attempted to further zone our little zone and the result has been less than happy. Worse, our connection between the little zones have been compromised to an extent, although you could argue that trains take the role of inter-zonal connections.</p>

              <p>I observed that the Citaros on 87 and 168 follow the DDs with a gap of 3 mins from interchange. At both Sengkang and Bedok, the Citaro left within 3-4 mins of the previous bus.</p>
              <p>87 and 168 often have loading that could exceed 120 pax. I believe the Citaro will be able to cater to the other few pax that cannot board the first bus. Hence, may be in terms of loading it might just have 30-40 pax. I call this "clearing bus" to clear off the additional pax that the previous bus does not take.</p>

              <p><br>I agree. I think the Citaros are extras on these routes to accommodate passengers that the DD in front has not taken.</p>
              <p>But sometimes scheduling is bad that they send a SD before DD. Saw this on 163. At Toa Payoh 163 SD came and 3 mins later there was a Dennis Trident. Ofcourse, went with only 2 pax from interchange, whereas the SD ahead took at least 40 pax from interchange.</p>
              <p>Going ahead SD will get fully packed, and DD will not take more than 40 pax in its route.</p>
