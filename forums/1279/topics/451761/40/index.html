              first thing...
              
              You dun even understand why MRT needs a timetable...
              
              The only diff the MRT has against the bus is it does not have to face peak hour traffic volume...
              
              but it still has to face variation in demand load at diff time belts - that's where dwell time has to be tweaked for both safety and realistic dwell time for everyone...
              
              I think ppl wouldn't even know Chinese Garden's actual dwell time is only 1 sec... door open, buzzer immediately activated...
              
              Then the timetable has to take into consideration off peak to peak transition for two reasons, the incremental pax load along the way and to ensure ample spacing between the peak hour trains that's dispatched from the depot...
              
              Obviously most of your here dun even understand the very behind things onto getting things done..
              
              If everything goes w/o timetable, when the peak hr train departs from the tracks, let's see how they're going to juggle the freq properly...

              what has avg speed got to do w/ practical driving?
              
              when you go downslope, you would slow down... you reach semi expressway, you can travel faster...
              
              what on earth avg speed is? This is therotical kinematics?

              <p>U go uphill slow down? Sure anot? U take 36 when going up benjamin sheares bridge how to slow down? U 1 the bus roll down is it? I agree that u go down hill must slow down, if the bus is travelling too quickly, the bus will lose control, and if unlucky will roll off the slope.</p>

              bus not so bad..
              
              but car, you've to ensure speed control... in case there's a stoppage, you're able to cut off engine power to stop...
              
              a lot of momentum from the engine power as you acclerate up...

              obviously you wun care, but the inefficiency is there for everyone to see.. erratic waiting time is one thing...
              
              you still dun get it... timetable is not abt being faster or what.. it's abt stability and order...
