              <p>No yaa... Not possible... The DDs on 151 could be empty (that is just 3 buses though in its whole fleet) but DDs on 25, 51, 55, 62, 87 are always packed to the brim in this area. The DDs on 81 could be empty depending on time. </p>

              <p>I feel if DDs are added to 74, it will be a visible service improvement. There are so many times when you wait for a 74 and see a packed SD coming and you go like "Why is it not a DD?" Many echo this feeling.</p>

              <p>I daren't say 151 doesnt need DD.</p>
              <p>151's loading is not very predictable and the crowd at Toa Payoh is not small at all. And rest assure that PM peak 151 DD is full-house from NUS.</p>
              <p>It is not uncommon to see a full-house 151 SD skip all stops along Bukit Timah Rd because of the Toa Payoh crowd and I can sympathise with that.</p>
              <p>The only thing predictable about 151 is its unpredictable frequency.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><br>For 151A to be deemed worthy of a reinstatement it has to at least terminate at Jln TPY Trellis Twrs, if not might as well serve full trip. Terminating at Aft Kheam Hock Rd is plain useless imo.</p>

              <p>I have taken before. AM Peak leaving at 7+am from HG.</p>

              <p>Its the same reason why the DD leaves NUS empty and the next SD becomes full house.</p>
              <p>Scheduling issues. The DD I took came 5 min after a SD left HG. Of course it would be empty.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless I cannot say 151 doesnt need DD.</p>
              <p>Because 151 does become full house when you least expect.</p>
              <p>And I dont want to say more, but there are a number of 151 BCs who mess up the schedule and cause all kinds of screwed-up frequency.</p>
              <p>One common tactic is to race with the 154....to see who can go slower.</p>

              <p>Please observe the loading pattern of 900 and 901. People come people go. Where will got people go upper deck one?</p>
              <p>The ppl on woodlands feeders are more than a DD can hold. As a result, people have to stand on the stairs when a DD is deployed. But bendies are different. They can hold standees at their rear portion and also the articulation joint area.</p>
              <p>Also, please take a look at how WILD people unload at Admiralty Stn when 913 pulls by. People SPAM out of the bus straightaway. With only one exit door that have to cope with both upper and lower deck pax at once, do you think a DD can cope?</p>
              <p>It is also the pax and the BC's adaptations and habit. That's why the SBST feeders and townlinks can successfully utilise DDs on its svcs. To elaborate more on the not moving to the upper deck problem, people may have this habit of not moving to the top as they know how painful it is to alight EVEN from bendies, LEAVE ALONE DDs. </p>
              <p>If u ask me, I think DDs are better utilised on 700, or 857 as you said. Also can be well utilised on 853, as the load at Kallang can get real traumatic at peak. But for Woodlands feeders or intratowns, it's a no-no, at least for me.</p>

              <p>Bendies are already so messy in Woodlands interchange. Look at all the jams they created during peak hours. People have to even walk on the road to the berth when alighting the buses because bendy buses block all the way for the buses behind. And you think people move in on board bendy buses, BCs also need to shout. Sometimes you even see the back trailer with no standees, waste of space on the roads, block other buses way as well.</p>
              <p>291 and 241 loads are also very heavy but you don't always see delays and jams in the bus stops and interchanges, unlike bendies which also creates messy jams and bottel necks in Woodlands intechange, long queues as well for Yishun and Chu Chua Kang interchange.</p>
              <p>Woodlands don't need more bendies, they need 1 or 2 more feeder bus services to balance the load from the current feeder services.</p>

              <p>If you park at the berth for boarding and alighting the length of the bus always blocks the way of other buses behind. The trailer part espcially blocks the path of the other bus behind.</p>
              <p>If it is boarding, only 1 bendy can stop there and allow boarding. Bus behind have to wait. If it is a SD, at least there is space for another bus behind to stop at the berth for passengers of another bus service to board, and can move off after all its passengers boarded. At least the bus did not block the path of another bus in the berth behind. But bendy bus is different. The whole of the lenght blocks the bus behind to delay its baording process and the rear trailer sometimes even black the bus behind another berth. Alighting is the same. Epic part is that if one bendy bus stuck at the rearmost alighting berth, it creates a whole queue of jams behind. Worst is when 2 bendy buses hog 2 alighting berths, other buses have no choice but to stop in between the 2 bendies and away from the kerb to allow people to alight, which is so dangerous and inconvenient. Not to mention that people have to walk more after alighting the bus, especially when some BCs are so fed up with these queues and jams that they decided to berth at somewhere further to avoid them.</p>
              <p>Because of these, other buses behind have to delay, BCs breaktimes delayed, passengers waiting times delayed and all these delays waste a lot of time and decreases the efficiency of buses.</p>
              <p>12m buses are different. They have the flexibility of moving in and out more easily once they have done their business. No need to take up so much space on the roads and berths. No need to waste so much time to change lane and just to move the whole damn lenghty thing out which takes more time and space just to move out.</p>
              <p>Just look at the queues and jams they created in the bus interchanges everyday. Even the BCs are so tired of them which makes them honk at these buses many times.</p>

              <p><br>Minority??? GO observe more before talking rubbish here. everytime I go Woodlands interchange there is sure to be a jam somewhere, unless it is very late at night.</p>
              <p>You think Woodlands interchange will still cope in future when the govt wants to put more buses in future??? Do you think the govt will continue to let the packed interchange problem to be inevitable forever??? Sorry, that is not the govt wants, packed and jammed bus interchanges. In this case, they will never justify the money they spend on more buses and bus services for the future. And they won't expand the interchange further just to house bendies in future. The land space needs in future are for other purposes as well. If they can use more buses at standard lenghts that gives them better efficiencies using the same land area, it is more justifiable for them to standardise their operations, rather than all the long bendies that creates more jams, queues and mess and wasting more land space just to house them.</p>
              <p>The current SMRT depots are already so crowded and messy and buses have to park outside the depot. All thanks to those road hogging bendies. I won't want SMRT to get any new bendies. I hope they can get all standard 12m SDs and DDs which gives them much less problems in delays, space constraints and scheduling in their bus operations. I hope they can be as efficient as SBST as well.</p>
              <p>Bendies go faster than DDs??? My foot. Bendies tend to hog as well, especially single lane roads. A nightmare for other buses and motorists behind. And they are very accident prone, having the highest accident rate compared to DDs and SDs. And no need for so fast in urban operations, engines wear out faster, buses burnt faster and you see more bendies burnt. Shortage of buses just because of all these burnt bendies costs SMRT bus operations negatively. Look like you never seen a DD overtake a bendy before as well. You are always living in your well.</p>

              <p>If you park at the berth for boarding and alighting the length
                  of the bus always blocks the way of other buses behind. The trailer
                  part espcially blocks the path of the other bus behind.</p>
              <p>If it is boarding, only 1 bendy can stop there and allow
                  boarding. Bus behind have to wait. If it is a SD, at least there is
                  space for another bus behind to stop at the berth for passengers of
                  another bus service to board, and can move off after all its
                  passengers boarded. At least the bus did not block the path of
                  another bus in the berth behind. But bendy bus is different. The
                  whole of the lenght blocks the bus behind to delay its baording
                  process and the rear trailer sometimes even black the bus behind
                  another berth. Alighting is the same. Epic part is that if one
                  bendy bus stuck at the rearmost alighting berth, it creates a whole
                  queue of jams behind. Worst is when 2 bendy buses hog 2 alighting
                  berths, other buses have no choice but to stop in between the 2
                  bendies and away from the kerb to allow people to alight, which is
                  so dangerous and inconvenient. Not to mention that people have to
                  walk more after alighting the bus, especially when some BCs are so
                  fed up with these queues and jams that they decided to berth at
                  somewhere further to avoid them.</p>
              <p>Because of these, other buses behind have to delay, BCs
                  breaktimes delayed, passengers waiting times delayed and all these
                  delays waste a lot of time and decreases the efficiency of
                  buses.</p>
              <p>12m buses are different. They have the flexibility of moving in
                  and out more easily once they have done their business. No
                  need to take up so much space on the roads and berths. No need to
                  waste so much time to change lane and just to move the whole damn
                  lenghty thing out which takes more time and space just to move
                  out.</p>
              <p>Just look at the queues and jams they created in the bus
                  interchanges everyday. Even the BCs are so tired of them which
                  makes them honk at these buses many times.</p>

              <p>All SMRT bus are SDs. It is just that they are seperated into rigids and bendies. If they dont use bendies, how are they going to take the load? You going to ask SMRT waste more money buy those rigids which are pretty useless during p hours. And some of the bendies still have to wait for 11 more years till de-registration. You cant expect SMRT to buy DDs as they have their disadvantages too. Everything has it advantages and disadvantages. If you're whining here about bendies and showing your rage and hatred in this thread, then I advise you. Either fuck off or dont even bother to come here. Coming here and showing your hatred is just flooding this thread with your nonsense. Why even bother coming here when you're just talking about bendies, not DDs for SMRT? Use some common sense kids, if you want DDs so badly, go fork out the sum of money yourself. Look at those buses in Nepal, those buses are either NAC or CAC. And those CAC buses' aircon don't even work sometimes. So stop whining for we're already fortunate enough to have good buses in Singapore. Nepal dosen't even have bendies or DD, not even a single unit. If you want to continue to whine here, go create a thread yourself and whine it out there, nobody would care about it and you won't get banned.</p>

              <p>I am not saying not stop using them immediately. I said before SMRT can gradually change to DDs while the exisiting bendies are being scrapped in the coming years. The transport landscape is changing from now, we can't keep on harping on the old problems forever. Yes, they may have advantages but having more disadvantages than SDs and DDs. How much longer and how much more problems is the govt going to face if these problems don't get solved now??? 11 years??? The last batch has less than 8 years left. These years are good enough that SMRT gradually change to DDs while taking into consideration of more buses on the roads in future and DTL.</p>

              <p>There will be refurbished bendies and the last batch were registered in 2004. If refurbished it will be 19 years and 2004 + 19 = 2023. And you're also not on for discussion, so what gives you the right to ask people to keep quiet? You're just whining here by showing your hatred to bendies. I doubt they would even purchase DDs as DTLs are coming. SMRT will sort out their problem themselves and it won't help in any bit if you continue to whine here. And it's not like you say scrap this bus then scrap this bus. You must give a particular reason if it is not burnt / accident before it's lifespan ends. Plus I've already showed a photo of how much trouble is needed to go through to scrap just 1 particular DD. Though a bendy might be more easy to scrap, that dosen't mean you say "SCRAP" means scrap in 1 day.</p>
