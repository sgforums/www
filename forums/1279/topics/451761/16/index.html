              <p>Man, you live where I would have loved to. Bukit Merah, the home to multiple DD routes - 5, 14, 132, 147, 153, 196, 197, 198. And I guess the only bendy route there is 176 and 851. </p>
              <p>I'll tell you what I like about joyriding on DDs. Good view from the upper deck and you can actually count the number of people alighting and boarding on every stop which I love doing to understand the loading pattern of buses. You can still do it on Citaros and KUBs but it is impossible to do it on bendies. Have tried it so many times. Also when a bendy is crowded you dont get to see a good view of the road and where you are heading. </p>
              <p>Anyway, these are personal reasons why I like joyriding on DDs but apart from that also I feel DDs definitely have practical advantages. You should take DDs - you might soon start a DD fan page :) </p>

              who use those routes are happy with bendies, it allows them to get
              out of the bus faster, lesser problems of people hogging the area

              something that isn't broken. lets not arbitrarily deploy DDs on any
              routes as we please. the bendies on the woodlands
              feeders/intratowns are doing just as well as the DDs on the
              services you stated above, if not better. maybe u could state the

              <p>Man, you live where I would have loved to. Bukit Merah, the home
              to multiple DD routes - 5, 14, 132, 147, 153, 196, 197, 198. And I
              guess the only bendy route there is 176 and 851. </p>
              <p>I'll tell you what I like about joyriding on DDs. Good view from
              the upper deck and you can actually count the number of people
              alighting and boarding on every stop which I love doing to
              understand the loading pattern of buses. You can still do it on
              Citaros and KUBs but it is impossible to do it on bendies. Have
              tried it so many times. Also when a bendy is crowded you dont get
              to see a good view of the road and where you are heading. </p>
              <p>Anyway, these are personal reasons why I like joyriding on DDs
              but apart from that also I feel DDs definitely have practical
              advantages. You should take DDs - you might soon start a DD fan
              page :) </p>

              <p>67 has height restrictions.</p>
              <p>But have to agree on CBD situations. Bendies can't go there as the traffic flow there is high and roads are busy. Also, many other svcs ply the CBD and bendies tend to hog the bus stop (DDs do that too but not as severe). But comes to intratowns/feeders, especially the Woodlands ones, it's a total different story. The roads they ply has barely any vehicles at all, and people only take for a few stops. Moreover, svcs like 913 have super chaotic alighting situations, even during non-peak. I have seen the pathetic situation how Townlink 222 practically "terminated" at Bedok Stn: it took a good 6 1/2 min to unload all of its pax. And yes, svc 242 have been STOMPed before by some idiot for having standees clogged at the upper deck and stairs. You can see which bus can "save the day" and prevent all these from happening. </p>
              <p>Also hope bendies can be deployed on svcs like 927, as there is height restrictions at Mandai and Mandai is not that packed, trust me. </p>
