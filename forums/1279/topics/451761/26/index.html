              <p>I am of the opinion that "competition" in our context is rubbish.</p>
              <p>A single operator makes more sense for us, the same way that cross-modal transport operators make sense from the POV of streamlining operations.</p>
              <p>Other countries that adopt "competitive tendering" have been more successful because they divide the different regions into zones and tender zone-by-zone. The market is segregated into intra and inter-zonal bus services, and this is how competition is injected.</p>
              <p>SG practically qualifies as a single zone. We attempted to further zone our little zone and the result has been less than happy. Worse, our connection between the little zones have been compromised to an extent, although you could argue that trains take the role of inter-zonal connections.</p>

              Mate, there are historical reasons why things are like this. After all, SMB's predecessor, Tibs began operations by taking over SBW and WDL routes in 1984. For the record, route 167 is the longest surviving SMB route.
              
              As for YIS, apart from 171, the rest of the bus routes were started from scratch by Tibs, hence their numbers starting with 8XX. It was also Tibs who attempted to improve connectivity in SKG but their expansion plans were halted by MBT in 1999. Whatever happened next is history.

              <p><br> Mate, there are historical reasons why things are like this. After
              all, SMB's predecessor, Tibs began operations by taking over SBW
              and WDL routes in 1984. For the record, route 167 is the longest
              surviving SMB route. As for YIS, apart from 171, the rest of the
              bus routes were started from scratch by Tibs, hence their numbers
              starting with 8XX. It was also Tibs who attempted to improve
              connectivity in SKG but their expansion plans were halted by MBT in
              1999. Whatever happened next is history.</p>

              <p>855 has a pretty good loading. I don't know why the frequency is poor. The good thing is that from Macritchie to Alexandra road, there is 93 in parallel - which too off late has a more than 10 minute frequency.</p>
              <p>I want to see DDs on 93 again (at least 2 of them). From the time CCL came, DDs on 93 have become a rarity.</p>
