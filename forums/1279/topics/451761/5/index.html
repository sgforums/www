              <p>1) This is the problem they should learn how to solve, not
              avoiding it.<br> 2) Orchard,Selegie,and Robinson road are pretty-much jam-prone
              during peak hours, With or without bendies things will still stay
              the same. Even if there is no bendies what about jams caused by
              other cars?<br> 5) Even if it isn't bendy-friendly, They still have to live with
              it. It is not every design is suited to fit them.<br> 4) This, Have to depend on frequency. If they are not tight enough
              one should do the trick. </p>

              <p>I agree with your first point, they should learn to solve it, but they should not deny that bendies are problematic because of the space they take everywhere, and they can be replaced by double deckers and better frequncy single decker fleets. To solve the problem, replace all bendies with <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">double deckers and better frequncy single decker fleets.</span></p>
              <p>Point 2 is invalid for all city roads. Do you know that bus lanes in city areas are not allowed for all vehicles except buses at all times??? At least without bendies, bus queues will be shorter, lesser jams and more buses can load and unload passengers at the same time for all bus lanes and bus stops. And how about bus interchanges and bus depots without other vehicles??? No matter what, bendies block and jam and takes up too much space in these places.</p>
              <p>Point 5 is total invalid and lame reason. You are encouraging inefficient bus system??? If LTA thinks like you, I think our bus system will be severely screwed and no one will want to take public transport. </p>
              <p>Point 4, if bendy buses are going to park into these new interchanges, how much space is left for other buses to park??? Those BCs left stranded waiting for a parking lot will get lesser rest time. If buses are going to move too frequent as well without enough rest, you will see more buses breakdown, more fires. And schedules should be planned for as much rest as possible for buses and BCs, so it makes more logic to make full use of the space to park as many buses as possible. </p>

              Our infrastructure are all based on 12m buses, it's your mindset and the bendies have to live with it. You live with constraints and not add problem and now start asking ppl to solve it.

              It doesn't matter what kind of buses, single decker, double decker or articulated buses, their poor and heck care attitude would just destroy any bus after some time. Crap bus company should have just close down long ago.

              It is possible if he want SMRT to continue to run articulated buses only. Just give 10 highest demand feeder services to SMRT and let SBST run the rest of the 200 over bus services in Singapore, which should also deprive the commuters living in North and Northwest from taking anymore of SMRT bus nonsense in future.

              <p>I agree with your first point, they should learn to solve it,
              but they should not deny that bendies are problematic because of
              the space they take everywhere, and they can be replaced by double
              deckers and better frequncy single decker fleets. To solve the
              problem, replace all bendies with <span>double
              deckers and better frequncy single decker fleets.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Point 2 is invalid for all city roads. Do you know that bus
              lanes in city areas are not allowed for all vehicles except buses
              at all times??? At least without bendies, bus queues will be
              shorter, lesser jams and more buses can load and unload passengers
              at the same time for all bus lanes and bus stops. And how about bus
              interchanges and bus depots without other vehicles??? No matter
              what, bendies block and jam and takes up too much space in these
              places.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Point 5 is total invalid and lame reason. You are encouraging
              inefficient bus system??? If LTA thinks like you, I think our bus
              system will be severely screwed and no one will want to take public
              transport. </span></strong></p>

              <p>These are jam-prone areas which can't be helped. Long vehicles makes matters worse I agree peak hours and bad weather, but it doesn't mean it long vehicles like bendies should get the boot out of our roads. Your solution might seem valid but the authorities will look at the overall condition.</p>
              <p>I am definitely not encouraging inefficient transport system but it is a fact that not all buses can fit in into our design structure.</p>
