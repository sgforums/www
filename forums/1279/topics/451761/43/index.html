              <p>They can have their advantages, but the problems they created for SMRTB, especially for the past years is more than its advantages it can give. I think one of the forum mates here have mentioned before, both models have their pros and cons, but given to the change to the operating environment, increasing population and more buses in future, LTA and bus companies have to choose the better of the worse.</p>

              <p>SBST copes up very well with long queues on 183, 291, 334. They have improved the frequency, added DDs. Do you see people complaining? No.</p>
              <p>Take the same situation in Yishun, CCK or Woodlands. Everyone is cribbing about SMRT services. That should tell a lot.</p>
              <p>DDs are a boon to Singapore while bendies are not. Wake up!!</p>

              <p>Bendies still have some uses for these svcs IMO, if they are that bad then just reduce the number la! And confine them only onto dose feeders/intratowns/short dist. routes like 962, 964, 859 and 856... Trunk svcs, CBD svcs and long dist. routes use DDs.</p>
              <p>If ONLY feeders use bendies and trunks use DDs, IT IS STILL REDUCING THE NO. OF BENDIES...</p>
              <p>It is really unreasonable for all bendies to clear out of SG, feeders still need them... DDs won't really solve the problems...</p>
