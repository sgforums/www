              <p>Firstly, by stopping slightly forward, it doesn't even affect anything. The bus still can turns out safely. Even if that isn't suggested, I don't even think Singapore transport have a good safety system please~  Don't even think about buses yet, nowadays car driver also anyhow. TP also not spotted on road~ So you think they drivers care? No please, not all drivers are so following the law always. However, I don't see any danger by stopping just abit infront, not as if the whole bus is directly stopping on the "\" part <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> </p>

              By the way people comment abt all these planning related stuff, obviously your cannot think of how to standardise, how to be fair to each n every bus sv's needs...
              
              Worst thing talk of some places like Sg Kadut having concrete factories, say also either dun want to know or dun wish to know but still want to stubbornly insist Sat not much lorry traffic...
              
              The only day CIQ have less lorry traffic is on Sunday... Not surprisingly, market stalls most dun open on Monday since there's no shipment of chicken, vegetables on Sunday...
              
              S911's case... Still cannot believe not a single 911 appears even w/ 2x 856 disparch.. still say is ok... eh.. I thought 911's freq is 3 - 5 mins??? Ghost buses?
              
              Woodlands N1 quite a decent chunk are 4 storey walk up flats, N8 side abt 70+ blocks of flats... like this cannot cope? is it schedule got problem or is it something else? Woah, then Sv 903, 912 how ar??? bigger catchment area...
              
              Still want to laugh... like things dun want to take it and think, and really think abt it...
              
              always think your know a lot of things... ask ppl to google abt econs, still say I know la.. keep quiet... I know many here are still in sec sch, poly.. There's still a lot of things to learn, dun think you're are very smart...
              
              Still have not even learn how to drive yet... worst...
              
              If SMB66X still insist wanting to know who I am... well I can tell u then.. I was the one who feedback-ed to SBST to operate downroutes for 179A in the evening from South Spine, abt possibility of pushing out more ADDs on 502 on weekends...
              
              People have contacts around, dun need to write each n everything over feedback, planning related issues over here... for next thing, kids later go backstab or want to get more info etc...

              During AM peak hrs, Pioneer Stn is a traffic jam blackspot.. even more jammed than Boon Lay and other roads inside Jurong West Extn...
              
              As for evening peak, w/ 241, 255 being so frequent and bus stop being so small.. no way so many buses can flood up Pioneer...
              
              Anyway, Pioneer Stn isn't the correct station to load up NTU students... only 1 pair of up and down riding escalator at the MRT Stn platform.. for high usage?
              
              Should see 179A's queue during the AM peak on some days... can stretch all the way out of JP2 the glass door beside Old Chang Kee...

              seriously, SBST can't deploy so many 179...
              
              arbo 241, 255, 257 will also get affected.. flooding of buses...
              
              and seriously, 179 isn't meant for MRT crowd to take.. those ppl along Pioneer Rd Nth often noticed hardly have boarding chance...

              and seriously in the evening.. if you're at 27251 bus stop, chances are it's very difficult to get onboard 179 at all... 
              
              It's only luckily w/ 179A downroute that the crowd can be cleared...
