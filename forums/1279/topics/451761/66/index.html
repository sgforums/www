              <p>1101 KUBs poor quality, 800 Citaros overworked? If they are so bad, they would have all broken down by now. SBST may not have the best buses but at least the recent fleet acquisitions, they brought many new buses, with more improved features. Moreover they maintained most of their buses well, even though it has more than 3000 buses. They are serious about their service, they do more than they say and are more practical. Using the type of buses bought as an indicator, that is really myopic in judging. The commuters are more concerned about service quality, not kind of buses used.</p>
              <p>SMRT wise, look at the buses, poorly maintained, even new buses have a lot of problems and getting very dirty. With about 800 buses, their proportion of poorly maintained buses is  higher compared to SBST. feedback to them, they don't care but only give standardised answers with no or little action taken. Yeah, don't tell me it is the fault of the BCs. Even if the BCs do not report any fault, the mechanics or fleet manager should have taken the initaitive to check or at least enforce something to run things systemactically.</p>
              <p>And SMRT buses are always overworked because they constantly speed a lot and the bendy buses are always overheating because they are not suitable for our demanding operations at all. That's why they burn.</p>
              <p>And please go read up the papers on the news after SMRTB strikes. Even the LTA and Mr Desmond Quek has admitted the company has management issues and the company should have learnt on how SBST managed its operations. LTA even looks at HK public transport system as role model. Go read the newspapers before spouting rubbish here. If SMRT has major management issues, then it has to learn from others to improve itself, even the new CEO recognize this problem, which is why he revamped the management and hire new people.</p>
              <p>As for you, I don't know what is your point of view, but seems like you are deliberately want SMRT to collaspe by continuing to run in their old ways. Sorry but their old way of management is the main excuse of all SMRT woes and problems. The old ways of managing should not be continued and if SMRT still wants to continue running and serious about improving, they should learn a bit from established experiences.</p>
              <p>You said you take SMRT buses more often, then you should know that they are notorious for their speeding, abrupt brakings and turnings. I take SMRT buses often too so I know these problems. Stop living in your self denial.</p>

              <p>You said that SMRT Buses are more dirty than SBS Transit buses. It's just the depot supervisor being lenient on washing the bus, already they have to end their shift late because of parking issues, now want to queue up just to wash a bus everyday?</p>
              <p>800 buses? Check again. Check before you post.</p>
              <p>You think its easy checking nearly 500 buses within a short timespan of 2.5 hours (assuming they should have finished parking at 2 am, SLs pick up their buses at 4.30am)? </p>
              <p>Bendy buses burn because of the improper fuel line assembly which causes diesel to leak onto hot engine parts. Again, check your facts. I can say that the Citaros are overworked (both companies) because of the BC/SL constantly flooring the bus.</p>
              <p>SMRT are imfamous for their speeding, abrupt turnings and braking? Quote me which service, bus and SL. The services i frequent does not have perm SLs which are like that, only sometimes a standby driver.</p>
              <p>I thought you know that the KUB are imfamous for jerking, even when the BC brakes smoothly? The Citaro's braking isn't smooth and causes the bus to jerk badly before stopping when the BC/SL floors the bus too. Personally I prefer older SDs over these new WAB SDs but the B9TLs are quite good and comfortable to ride on.</p>

              <p>You should take SBS7452J~ Took this bus today, was super pleased with the performance(interior, unsure of the exterior engine, the roaring part). Aircon was good, less(or no) vibration, quiet..simply bring me back the day where the CDGEs are new on 161(my first few rides)~~ The only thing is the bell chime is loud, so as the door closing one :/</p>
              <p>Another Volvo bus you should take is SBS9889U~ Aircon for today(on 143) quite powerful, the rear headrest on upper deck very comfortable also (:</p>

              <p>You said that SMRT Buses are more dirty than SBS Transit buses. It's just the depot supervisor being lenient on washing the bus, already they have to end their shift late because of parking issues, now want to queue up just to wash a bus everyday?</p>
              <p>800 buses? Check again. Check before you post.</p>
              <p>You think its easy checking nearly 500 buses within a short timespan of 2.5 hours (assuming they should have finished parking at 2 am, SLs pick up their buses at 4.30am)? </p>
              <p>Bendy buses burn because of the improper fuel line assembly which causes diesel to leak onto hot engine parts. Again, check your facts. I can say that the Citaros are overworked (both companies) because of the BC/SL constantly flooring the bus.</p>
              <p>SMRT are imfamous for their speeding, abrupt turnings and braking? Quote me which service, bus and SL. The services i frequent does not have perm SLs which are like that, only sometimes a standby driver.</p>
              <p>I thought you know that the KUB are imfamous for jerking, even when the BC brakes smoothly? The Citaro's braking isn't smooth and causes the bus to jerk badly before stopping when the BC/SL floors the bus too. Personally I prefer older SDs over these new WAB SDs but the B9TLs are quite good and comfortable to ride on.</p>

              <p>Lenient or lazy? End shift late because of parking issue? You see, the long bus queues problem caused by bendy buses late midnight when all BCs ended their shifts. Not only BCs have to go home late and have lesser time to rest because of this, even the depot personnels have to suffer too.</p>
              <p>Not easy to check, not bother to check or no time to check? SBST have more than 3000 buses, why do they check and wash most of their buses properly?</p>
              <p>You already highlighted the problems of the engine design of bendy buses. Still want more of such to burn due to our hot tropical weather and high demanding operations?</p>
              <p>You still living in your self denial that SMRTB BCs are notorious for speeding hard brakings and abrupt turnings. You want examples, but I can tell you most encounters on SMRTB buses I will experience either or all of such, unless the BC drives about 50km/h throughout the trip. Seen a few times people fell or amost fell down because of these BCs hard brakings especially.</p>
              <p>And MAN buses jerk as well and more than the Citaros.</p>

              <p>i really hope that SMRT can improve their care for buses</p>

              <p>ask yourself, do you want to see a KUD or any other DDs to catch fire?</p>
              <p>desgin of bendies is one part of it</p>
              <p>but what about the SMRT problem?</p>

              <p>Which is why I always highlighted, SMRT must improve their way of operations. And many have highlighted the problems of bendy buses which also part of the main cause of SMRTB's messy and disorganised operations. so if SMRTB wants to improve in these aspects, they have to change their types of buses used too.</p>
              <p><br>However the new CEO just took over, it still needs time to see whether he is serious about doing the improvements.</p>
