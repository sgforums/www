              <p>standardising the fleet to 12m buses is not an option. its a matter of finding space to park and deploying them to the correct service. what will happen to high-demand routes that cannot have DDs? put more 12m buses? they can't even find enough drivers.</p>
              <p>right now they are sticking to merc, MAN and gemilang for a reason. merc (OC/Citaro) and MAN engine spare parts are interchangeable and its easy and fast to get spare parts for bodywork.</p>
              <p>stopping the usage of bendy buses will paralyse SMRT. quite a number of their routes need high capacity buses and DDs wont make the cut because of height restrictions along the route. the same as my above point, buy more 12m rigids but nobody to drive them.</p>
              <p>stopping their shuttle bus services is as good as throwing out busplus. what for they close down their chartering sector when they are quite well known for their charter services, especially for big events? they just need to improve on their services like introducing school bus service.</p>
              <p>no comment for depot issue though, not so familiar with that</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Their main business is not charter sercvices, it is public bus services.</p>
              <p>If they can't even manage and provide a decent basic public bus service in the first place, they shouldn't even be allowed to run chartered services in the first place. Ironically, you said they have not enough drivers, etc. Then why do they divert their resources to other kinds of services where public bus services is their main core and they are not even provided with satisfactory standards instead? If they are so interested in running chartered services or school bus service, then SMRTB should drop their public bus business and let SBST or another operator run their bus services instead.</p>
              <p>What an absurd idea for SMRT to run school bus services. If so, they might as well go private like Comfort Bus and forget about public bus operations.</p>
              <p>I can tell you SMRTB will not be paralysed without the use of bendy buses. From what I see yesterday, it has always been paralysed by the problems caused by bendy buses instead all these years. And Singapore land use is very limited, especially when the govt keeps on increasing the population as and when they want.</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say that transport is only part of the challenge of land use by the Singapore govt and there are many infrastructures and types of land use that poses more challenges in future for the govt. Do you think the govt will give more land space for bendy buses when standard length fleets can do an equally same job as well?</p>
              <p>If SBST can achieve better service standards without the use of bendy buses, why can't SMRTB do it? Is it because of SMRTB poor management of bus fleets or is it the problem with bendy buses? If you are telling me that SMRTB isn't using more standard lenght fleets for their services nowadays, you are wrong. Some services are already converted to almost full single decker fleets, because they are meeting the QoS requirements. Improving more on the frequencies requires more buses,Â  and SMRTB is recruiting more BCs. Moreover if they stop providing shuttle services and RWS services, more of their BCs can be diverted to improve the frequecies.</p>
              <p>If areas under SBST can allow double deckers to operate, why must SMRTB areas be atÂ  the disadvantaged (or special)Â situation of not operating double deckers? Or is it they really don't give a damn in seriously improving their bus services? If so, then best is to give up all the bus services to SBST and LTA toÂ assist in improving roads like Dunearn Rd to allow SBST to operate double deckers and take over the role toÂ improve the bus servicesÂ in the North and Northeastern regions as well.</p>
              <p>Lastly my question, is allowing our BCs to have more resting time after driving long hours, a more jam and queue free bus lanes, interchanges and depots, and efficient and easier to manage bus operationsÂ <strong>more important</strong> or is it fulfilling the fantasies have having varieties of bus fleets more important? Go figure yourself.</p>

              <p>That's why SMRTB needs to be improved. They don't have to be as good as SBSTÂ  nor be perfect but at least show some serious effort to improve and shave off more of the imperfections to make them look better than they were under the old management.</p>
              <p>Yes, look at the glass half full and so never assume SMRTB will be paralysed without bendies. ProbablyÂ SMRTB will be better off without them.</p>

              <p>Their main business is not charter sercvices, it is public bus
              services.</p>
              <p>If they can't even manage and provide a decent basic public bus
              service in the first place, they shouldn't even be allowed to run
              chartered services in the first place. Ironically, you said they
              have not enough drivers, etc. Then why do they divert their
              resources to other kinds of services where public bus services is
              their main core and they are not even provided with satisfactory
              standards instead? If they are so interested in running chartered
              services or school bus service, then SMRTB should drop their public
              bus business and let SBST or another operator run their bus
              services instead.</p>
              <p>What an absurd idea for SMRT to run school bus services. If so,
              they might as well go private like Comfort Bus and forget about
              public bus operations.</p>
              <p>I can tell you SMRTB will not be paralysed without the use of
              bendy buses. From what I see yesterday, it has always been
              paralysed by the problems caused by bendy buses instead all these
              years. And Singapore land use is very limited, especially when the
              govt keeps on increasing the population as and when they want.</p>
              <p>I am sorry to say that transport is only part of the challenge
              of land use by the Singapore govt and there are many
              infrastructures and types of land use that poses more challenges in
              future for the govt. Do you think the govt will give more land
              space for bendy buses when standard length fleets can do an equally
              same job as well?</p>
              <p>If SBST can achieve better service standards without the use of
              bendy buses, why can't SMRTB do it? Is it because of SMRTB poor
              management of bus fleets or is it the problem with bendy buses? If
              you are telling me that SMRTB isn't using more standard lenght
              fleets for their services nowadays, you are wrong. Some services
              are already converted to almost full single decker fleets, because
              they are meeting the QoS requirements. Improving more on the
              frequencies requires more buses,Â  and SMRTB is recruiting more
              BCs. Moreover if they stop providing shuttle services and RWS
              services, more of their BCs can be diverted to improve the
              frequecies.</p>
              <p>If areas under SBST can allow double deckers to operate, why
              must SMRTB areas be atÂ  the disadvantaged (or
              special)Â situation of not operating double deckers? Or is it
              they really don't give a damn in seriously improving their bus
              services? If so, then best is to give up all the bus services to
              SBST and LTA toÂ assist in improving roads like Dunearn Rd to
              allow SBST to operate double deckers and take over the role
              toÂ improve the bus servicesÂ in the North and Northeastern
              regions as well.</p>
              <p>Lastly my question, is allowing our BCs to have more resting
              time after driving long hours, a more jam and queue free bus lanes,
              interchanges and depots, and efficient and easier to manage bus
              operationsÂ <strong>more important</strong> or is it fulfilling
              the fantasies have having varieties of bus fleets more important?
              Go figure yourself.</p>

              <p>Height limits problems is easier to solve than land space limits problems, especially in land scare city state like Singapore. That's why you see many layers of infrastructures in Singapore, not spreading all over the place. Like what I have said, if SMRTB is really serious about improving their bus services, why would they allow the areas to be at a disadvantaged situation as compared to their SBST areas? Height limitation is just an excuse. The sky has no limits, it's a matter that are they flexible to change or just can't be bothered and rather sit at the problem.</p>
              <p>And places like Dunearn Rd will be served by DTL in a few years time. Don't even see the need to increase the bus fleet capacity further when the demand is going to DTL by then. SMRTB may even withdraw or merge some of the current services.</p>
