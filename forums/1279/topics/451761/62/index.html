              thats why SDs with higher freq or bendies are more suitable for feeders. people are not so willing to move up. moving to the rear is much more easier and better, there is always another exit at the rear unlike DDs.

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOR SOME FEEDERS/INTRA-TOWN/TOWNLINKS :</span></strong><br><strong>1ST GRP : </strong>If I were to put myself into the shoe of those tired office workers/passengers, I would rather take rigid/bendy than DD, same goes to those in the rush(not going the upper deck, but rather stand at lower deck).</p>
              <p><strong>2ND GRP :</strong> But still, if I were to put myself into the shoe of those tired construction workers(standing all day long), I would aim for any seats that's avaliable in the bus, of cause 1st deck first~</p>
              <p>Which means to say, it all depends on the type of commuters~ But there's sure some commuters in both group acting the opposite way from what I've said (: If swey swey kenna the 1st one, no choice but to stand.Â </p>
              <p>Anyway, JIE svc with DDs is the worst case I've seen~ Those workers either stand on the 2nd deck, or sit on the staircase steps~ Especially svc 249. Whenever there's a 2 buses bunching, the back bus alone would be packed~Â </p>

              <p>Both bendies and DDs have approximately equal capacity IMO, I do agree that DDs are better in terms of shorter length and no articulator problem but you can't deny that bendies do not have height problems and can travel fast in general. Well, speed wise it will still have to depend on the drivers, but there are reasons why bendies are used for certain occasions such as Airshow Shuttles or MRT shuttles instead of double deckers.Â </p>
              <p>Other countries such as HK can use full-fleet DDs doens't mean we have to follow them! We can have our own variety of buses of having both DDs and bendies (Well, I know that is a biased statement but that is not my main point anyway, but if bendies have their own advantage why not use them?).</p>
              <p>SMRT has been operating quite okay all these while and I don't find anything wrong with the usage of bendies as high-capacity buses. Yes, you can say that 3 12-metre DDs are way better than 2 18-metre bendies. But if the service happens to be anti-DDs, doesn't make a difference. Well, you may say that time passes and there will be more new train lines such as DTL coming in, and by then no need bendies (Time still too early to tell and you still want to bullshit?). And don't forget, bus services also ply routes which MRTs do not operate on, and they might be faster than MRTs.</p>
              <p>And even if SMRT were to buy DDs, which DD do you expect SMRT to buy? B9TL SBST have a thousand liao, and don't forget certain DDs have bus confirgurations which are not suitable for Singapore usage such as the Alexander Dennis Enviro 500. Although I may not have accurate sources here, I would still say that if you want DDs for SMRT, think of what DD model SMRT should buy before commenting.</p>
              <p>Maybe if you want to argue that certain bus services which formerly uses DDs now use bendies but can still revert to bendies. Have you ever thought of why this happens? It can be because bendies happen to be a more effective high-capacity bus type for that <strong>PARTICULAR</strong> service.</p>
              <p>For those who think that SMRT should transfer all bus services to SBST, think again. Don't forget that SBST also handles the North East Line and Downtown Line other than a large fleet of buses, and in the future who knows SBST will accquire control of more train services?</p>
              <p>Both bendies and DDs work well together for these few years. As for WAB bendies wise, we can only wait for the results of the trial for the NG363F before making any reckless predictions.</p>
              <p>If we really want to debate everything out why not just make a gamble on whether SMRT will ditch bendies or not (Whether SMRT will accquire bendies or not I dun really care) since we know that no matter how much we say you will never be convinced? Not being convinced doesn't mean that all our points are weak btw (though I admit there are still some), it's just that you always want to rebutt to all our weak points and make a mountain out of the molehill.</p>
              <p>I won't force you if you want to take up the gamble in case you find it childish or unnecessary or whatsoever. Just rebut to my points as much as you want, cos' I already foresee that you will not be convinced as well.</p>

                              <p>Both bendies and DDs have approximately equal capacity IMO, I do
              agree that DDs are better in terms of shorter length and no
              articulator problem but you can't deny that bendies do not have
              height problems and can travel fast in general. Well, speed wise it
              will still have to depend on the drivers, but there are reasons why
              bendies are used for certain occasions such as Airshow Shuttles or
              MRT shuttles instead of double deckers.Â </p>
              <p>Other countries such as HK can use full-fleet DDs doens't mean
              we have to follow them! We can have our own variety of buses of
              having both DDs and bendies (Well, I know that is a biased
              statement but that is not my main point anyway, but if bendies have
              their own advantage why not use them?).</p>
              <p>SMRT has been operating quite okay all these while and I don't
              find anything wrong with the usage of bendies as high-capacity
              buses. Yes, you can say that 3 12-metre DDs are way better than 2
              18-metre bendies. But if the service happens to be anti-DDs,
              doesn't make a difference. Well, you may say that time passes and
              there will be more new train lines such as DTL coming in, and by
              then no need bendies (Time still too early to tell and you still
              want to bullshit?). And don't forget, bus services also ply routes
              which MRTs do not operate on, and they might be faster than
              MRTs.</p>
              <p>And even if SMRT were to buy DDs, which DD do you expect SMRT to
              buy? B9TL SBST have a thousand liao, and don't forget certain DDs
              have bus confirgurations which are not suitable for Singapore usage
              such as the Alexander Dennis Enviro 500. Although I may not have
              accurate sources here, I would still say that if you want DDs for
              SMRT, think of what DD model SMRT should buy before commenting.</p>

              to SBST, think again. Don't forget that SBST also handles the North
              East Line and Downtown Line other than a large fleet of buses, and

              services?</p>
