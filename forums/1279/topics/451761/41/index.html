              <p>Actually if SMRT dun wan bendies why they still list it in the tender, for show???</p>
              <p>Anyways, I can think of pros and cons of SMRT having DDs only.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pros</span></p>
              <p>1. Less jams at the bus stop, bus int and road(esp. one lane roads like Tiong Bahru Rd) Less parking woes at the bus int and depots.</p>
              <p>2. More seats.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cons</span></p>
              <p>1. The runtime of SMRT services will be longer. From Thomson Rd-Tiong Bahru, it will take 20mins for 851. But with DDs, 40mins... Service 300/302's runtime will also be longer.</p>
              <p>2. Some services with road issues cannot have DDs either, like service 800, which has a tight turn at Yishun St 71(same as C'wealth Dr issue).</p>
              <p>I would still prefer bendies for Feeders/Intratowns and Short Distance routes like 856/859/962/964 etc. and DDs for CBD services and Long Distance Routes.</p>
              <p>CCK has no problems with bendies. Absolutely no problem.</p>
              <p>BBT no problems but parking woes. Current situation is still fine.</p>
              <p>BPJ has bus stop, road and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p>SBW has no problems with bendies. Absolutely no problem.</p>
              <p>YIS has bus stop, road, bus int and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p>WDL has bus int and parking woes. Have to reduce the number.</p>
              <p><span>But bear in mind, once you use DDs, the runtime for 300/302/800/804/806/811/812/</span>856/859/900<span>/901/903/911/912/913/962/964 will be longer. DDs have speed issues as well as boarding and alighting issues and the top deck issues.</span></p>
              <p>Keep in mind that service 969's runtime will be severly lengthened by x2!</p>
              <p><strong>Boarding and alighting</strong></p>
              <p>If the commuters vacate the bus earlier with the help of an extra door, wouldn't the commuters be able to board faster too? Since when the commuters alighted, there will be more space to move in to the rear. But boarding only at interchanges is a problem.</p>
              <p>Bendy to unload- 2 mins.</p>
              <p>DD to unload- 6 mins.</p>
              <p>3 Doors DD to unload- 4 mins due to the NARROW stairs.</p>
              <p>This is especially very useful on the high demand services 800/804/806/811/812/912/913.</p>
              <p><strong>3 Doors DD</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, 3 Doors DD is useful, but have you ever forgotten about the stairs? Narrow and steep, commuters at the upper deck still have to climb down, which is slow and troublesome.</p>
              <p><strong>Top Deck Issues</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, more people have moved up to the top deck recently, like 291/334/Bedok/Boon Lay Feeders(except 241A). But there are still people who refuse to go up, which is the reason why SBST refused to deploy DDs on service 238.(And due to tight turn issues). </p>
              <p>Note: There ARE still some SBST services in which people don't move up. (I think SMB128B has mentioned about service 87/238 before. But I may have seen wrongly.)</p>
              <p>And people not moving to the rear of a bendy is NOT true, look at WDL/YIS feeders and intratowns. 856 yes but nobody wanted to stand at the narrow rear aisle. Even on O405s, be it SD/DD(Lower Deck)/Bendy, nobody would want to stand at the narrow rear aisle. This excludes the top deck of DDs, due to the no standing rule. BTW there's no "that kind of aisle" at the top deck...</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth, dun blast me for this.</p>

              <p>Baseless assumptions.</p>
              <p>Runtime won't be longer even if SMRTB uses double deckers. And SMRTB bus services needs a bit more runtime for many bus services as most BCs have to rush to complete the journey. This adds up to the stress they are facing driving the bus services everyday. No wonder the PRC BCs went on strike and may are unhappy with the working hours and conditions.</p>
              <p>Boarding and unloading time is more of less the same for both double deckers and bendy buses. But bendy buses take up much more space in the bus stop and delaying other buses behind. Double deckers on the other hand gives the flexibility for other buses behind to stop and allow boarding and alighting and do not delay buses behind. I don't see double deckers along bus stops delaying other buses but the long queues caused by bendy buses always delays other buses.</p>
              <p>Upper deck seating issues is improving, in fact many people are moving up because they want to find a seat and break away from the crowd in the lower deck. Bendy buses are also problematic when people do not want to move into the rear of the bus. Feeder services will be better to improved with more frequencies using single deckers, unless LTA wants to cut down the number of feeder services. Long frequencies using bendy buses is not efficient for places with many services.</p>

              <p>Are you crazy? Look at 300 case (or any feeder services that have the same issue as 300), they need to have at least 15-20 (or more) single deck buses to solve the problem which also use alot of parking space.

                  the stress they are facing driving the bus services everyday. No
                  wonder the PRC BCs went on strike and may are unhappy with the
                  working hours and conditions.</p>
              <p>Boarding and unloading time is more of less the same for both
                  double deckers and bendy buses. But bendy buses take up much more
                  space in the bus stop and delaying other buses behind. Double
                  deckers on the other hand gives the flexibility for other buses
                  behind to stop and allow boarding and alighting and do not delay
                  buses behind. I don't see double deckers along bus stops delaying
                  other buses but the long queues caused by bendy buses
                  always delays other buses.</p>
              <p>Upper deck seating issues is improving, in fact many people are
                  moving up because they want to find a seat and break away from the
                  crowd in the lower deck. Bendy buses are also problematic when
                  people do not want to move into the rear of the bus. Feeder
                  services will be better to improved with more frequencies using
                  single deckers, unless LTA wants to cut down the number of feeder
                  services. Long frequencies using bendy buses is not efficient for
                  places with many services.</p>
              <p><br> If they want to reject, why not?</p>
              <p>Bendy buses are not relevant to their operational needs anymore.
                  They created more problems to SMRTB instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> If you have noticed, many of these SMRTB buses are already
                  exceeding the speed limits for commercial vehicles. Wonder
                  what are all the TPs doing.</p>

              <p>Not that we don't want justify, but we recognised the importance of bendies. Even if we were to justify, will you be convinced? I doubt so. So what's the point of wasting our breath when you continued your stubbornness that bendies are still useless. And seriously, don't talk as if we al despise DDs. Many of us bendies support DDs as well, with exception that we support bendies as well.</p>
