              <p>I live in SMRT and I have to tolerate SMRT bullshit everyday.</p>
              <p>What is the population of Singapore when TIBS existed? What is the population for Singapore now? Bendy buses are impractical now with our densely crowded population now and more in future.</p>
              <p>If you are point out faults, I think bendy buses have a lot more buses than other kind of buses here (single deckers and double deckers)</p>
              <p>Just observe the number of burnt down bendy buses all these years. The recent higher accident rates of bendy buses. Squeaky articulators, run down, rotting and dirty articulator joints are common. Swaying trailiers due to worn out tires and aging articulators with faults. And almost all bendy buses have overheating engines that are awaiting to be burnt one day. And these problems are just maintanance and structural issues of these buses on top of its other problems like queues and blocking of lanes and taking up spaces in bus stops, bus interchanges and depots.</p>
              <p>Since bendy buses are part of the problem that cause many SMRT bus services to have irregular and late frequencies, limited deployment to cause such delays and overcrowdings, I'll rather SMRT to use double deckers instead. Compare Bedok and Boon Lay to Yishun and Woodlands, the efficiency are miles apart. The latter group always faces jams and inefficiencies because of chaotic long buses blocking the ways and taking up limited spaces in interchanges.</p>
              <p>If SMRT have to sacrifice bendy buses to seriously improve its bus services greatly, it will be certainly be worth it for SMRTB. Which do you prefer, current poor service standards with SMRTB continue going downwards(with bendy buses), or a better bus service from SMRTB with lesser jams and inefficiencies (with single deckers and a number of double deckers)?  </p>

              <p>SMRT's main problem is AMDEP... its so full buses are already starting to park outside, like BRBP. AMDEP is also anti-DD. WLDEP is partly anti-DD. KJDEP is DD friendly</p>

              eh... traffic condition of schedules is very obvious case..
              
              You can only forsee a say 75% of the traffic conditon, traffic cycle and any potential impulse traffic load for a given period.... the rest it all depends on how much time you can try to give to buses plying along main corridor...
              
              never forget, there can be problematic bus stops whereby either way of giving more time or less time would create an issue of it's own...

              <p>people taking service 190 can use DTL2 to the city. and 969 will has increase of SD buses on the service and also there will be MRT line coming soon on LTA plan. 854 also will has increase buses. I think 190 still be around but no DD or bendies. 190 is useful to SMRT as to provide commerce competition to SBST run DTL2. </p>

              <p>You try deploying DD on 806, see how long it takes for people to alight? They say use bendy delay bus stop for 5min, use DD also same case, slow unloading also delay bus stop for 5min. Makes no difference. </p>
              <p>However, I am completely fine with SMRT buying DDs, it's just a matter of fact to deploy them on the right services. Deploy DDs on 190 and 106 would be the best. Deploy bendies on feeders. If you deploy them on feeders <strong>ONLY</strong>, that would reduce the number of bendies to 50 or 100 as in an acceptable level, the main problem now is CBD, but 67, 171, 700 and 960 cannot deploy DDs due to Dunearn Rd and 67, 700 and 960 have no choice but to use bendies due to High Loading and those low trees along Dunearn Rd.</p>
              <p>Stop whining, people... Just accept them for who they are... I beg all of you... I ALSO GIVE DDS PROS AND I NEVER EVER SAID THAT DDS ARE BAD.</p>

              <p>I live in SMRT and I have to tolerate SMRT bullshit everyday.</p>
              <p>What is the population of Singapore when TIBS existed? What is the population for Singapore now? Bendy buses are impractical now with our densely crowded population now and more in future.</p>
              <p>If you are point out faults, I think bendy buses have a lot more buses than other kind of buses here (single deckers and double deckers)</p>
              <p>Just observe the number of burnt down bendy buses all these years. The recent higher accident rates of bendy buses. Squeaky articulators, run down, rotting and dirty articulator joints are common. Swaying trailiers due to worn out tires and aging articulators with faults. And almost all bendy buses have overheating engines that are awaiting to be burnt one day. And these problems are just maintanance and structural issues of these buses on top of its other problems like queues and blocking of lanes and taking up spaces in bus stops, bus interchanges and depots.</p>
              <p>Since bendy buses are part of the problem that cause many SMRT bus services to have irregular and late frequencies, limited deployment to cause such delays and overcrowdings, I'll rather SMRT to use double deckers instead. Compare Bedok and Boon Lay to Yishun and Woodlands, the efficiency are miles apart. The latter group always faces jams and inefficiencies because of chaotic long buses blocking the ways and taking up limited spaces in interchanges.</p>
              <p>If SMRT have to sacrifice bendy buses to seriously improve its bus services greatly, it will be certainly be worth it for SMRTB. Which do you prefer, current poor service standards with SMRTB continue going downwards(with bendy buses), or a better bus service from SMRTB with lesser jams and inefficiencies (with single deckers and a number of double deckers)?  </p>

              <p>i can tell u there are at least 2 pieces of evidence that can

              <p>anyways, no company is perfect</p>
              <p>true enuf, smrt is terrible at maintanence </p>
              <p>but that doesnt mean the other company, sbs transit is godly</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">their maintanence is also sucky, just as terrible as smrt</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">their frequencies and reliability of bus is just as bad as smrt

              <p>and who say certain sbst bus dont drive recklessly, just as
              certain smrt buses do</p>
              <p>smrt scheduling problematic? same goes to sbst. u dun tell me
              that u dun see sbst bus trying to chiong to catch up with their

              <p>It turned out to be factually wrong and just plain sitting on the fence which just puts you in bad light with the said company!</p>
              <p>SBST is not godly.</p>
              <p>But I hardly heard of people saying SBST ignores feedback (SMRT raised the heckles of the public years ago, ignoring complaints), and to the public, SBST has been doing a brilliant fleet replacement job.</p>
              <p>As for manteinance, don't kid yourself. I can safely say that SBST buses do have <em>better</em> mainteinance. This is a fact. Not an opinion. If you wanna prove me wrong, then you gotta nit-pick, which makes you no better than the people you lampooned. Frequency also. Don't kid yourself. In general I don't have as many problems with SBST than with SMRT. Again, if you wanna prove me wrong, you'll have to nit-pick on say....156, 163 etc. </p>
              <p>And only to some of you guys, SBST buys "terrible buses"! To me, the fleet replacement exercise has brought a pleasant fresh breath to the fleet.</p>
