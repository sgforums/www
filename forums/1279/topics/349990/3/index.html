              <p>I think u may have missed the point here. Qn is: the BC angry with you for not flagging? Not a matter of whether it's understood if u wana board the bus when u are at the doorstep.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>the purpose of flagging the bus is to let the BC stop for you to board. in my case the driver was rude. theres no need to scold. if by not flagging the BC have that common sense to understand i need to board the bus, theres no need to be scolding thereafter. its v unnecessary. otherwise, the BC if he is really that dumb he can just drive past me since he doesnt understand i want to board even if i am at the door.</p>

              <p>firstly, you should understand that if you wish to indicate to the bus captain that you wish to board, you should stick your hand out and flag the bus. not stand up and expect the bus captain to stop for you.</p>
              <p>i've experienced such things many times in the morning on service 119.</p>
              <p>there's always a group of girls from CHIJ, (the sengkang one, 3rd stop away from sengkang int.) who wait at the bus stop right after sengkang int, for service 119. when they see 119 come, they loiter around the kerb of the bus bay, but no one flags the bus. that bus stop is one where the seats are located far away from the actual kerb of the bus bay, and furthermore, many services stop at that bus stop. so naturally, there will be many people standing there.</p>
              <p>it is only till those girls see the bus heading straight for the traffic junction, before they start running. and it's always the same few girls. the bc says the same thing to them. sometimes it's not the fault of the BC. they don't purposely take notice of potential passengers waiting at a stop. so it's only understandable that they get a scolding, as firstly, they put the safety of standees on the bus at risk, by having the driver apply a large brake pressure to quickly stop the bus. secondly, as the bus always overshoots the bus bay by the time the BC notices the students and stops, it also endangers other road users. and it's a waste of time having the driver look out for potential passengers. that's why it's only understandable when sometimes, you get reprimanded by the drivers.</p>

              <p><br>the purpose of flagging the bus is to let the BC stop for you to board. in my case the driver was rude. theres no need to scold. if by not flagging the BC have that common sense to understand i need to board the bus, theres no need to be scolding thereafter. its v unnecessary. otherwise, the BC if he is really that dumb he can just drive past me since he doesnt understand i want to board even if i am at the door.</p>

              <p>In fact, sv315 has all along been like that at North Ave 1 bus stop since the NAC (AMDEP) period, but it's best to flag when you're alone, or the bus stop with two or more services. Just a few days ago, a commuter who didn't flag for the bus early at North Ave 4 bus stop nearly miss the bus, he flag only when he realise the bus isn't stopping for him, the brake was hard...</p>

              <p>ok..abit weird idea. maybe have the ts wear the route number ts want to board as a large signboard on his head. then no need to stand up and flag le. BC will see if the route number is their route number then stop for him...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
