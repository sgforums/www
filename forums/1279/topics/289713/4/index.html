Please refer to page 199 of Transitlink Guide 1992, you can see that service 197 was already plying Bedok - Boon Lay. An amendment made on 28 June the same year shortened it from Bedok - Boon Lay to Bedok - Jurong East. You can also see in this version of Transitlink Guide, service 41 did not appear in the guide as it was already integrated with service 197.</div></blockquote>When 197 shifted from Jurong to Boon Lay, it was still going to Geylang Lor 1. The Boon Lay Interchange Guide and the 1990 Bus Guide reflects this. The Bedok amendment came later.</div>
