When service 147 was integrated with service 83 (Punggol - New Bridge Rd), service 147 was amended to ply Stamford Rd, Waterloo St, Middle Rd, Selegie Rd and Serangoon Rd (Jln Besar, Bencoolen St and Bras Basah Rd in the return direction).<br><br>Perhaps to maintain the link between Victoria St / North Bridge Rd and the rest of service 147 route up to Clementi, and also to act as a supplementary service to service 147, FAC service 148 was introduced in June 1992 duplicating service 147 route between Clementi and Hill St / North Bridge Rd. Due to demand was not satisfactory, service 148 was withdrawn after 5 months, in Nov 1992. On the same day service 148 was withdrawn, service 196 was extended from Buona Vista to Clementi so that Clementi and Dover residents had another bus service to connect to Queensway and Jln Bukit Merah.<br></div>
