              <p>MAN bus. Might be a 24.420 HOCL. Cant rmbr. But i saw this bus before. When reversing its beeping sound damn loud one, machiam like a car's horn. It has a 12 speed manual or semi auto gearbox as well. Saw the picture of it somewhere.</p>
              <p>Somehow its quite slow on the highway, compared to SDs with an equivalent height. My coach overtooked this bus before.</p>

              <p>Then it would be K310EB. However, it would be unwise to fit a DD coach with such a small engine. I've taken a coach that lacks engine power and climbs a genting hill. All other coaches overtooked us, including a Scania K124IB 3 axle DD with 420bhp 12litre engine. The bus i took was an old MAN coach.</p>
              <p>Scania Singapore offers coaches with 12 litre engines, mainly Scania K340IB, K380EB and K380EB (6x2).</p>

              <p>I'm more inclined to think its a 4th Generation Scania K124IB 6X2 which has been configured such that the centre is a low floor portion instead of a standard intercity floor. Similar examples would be PZ18Z (K124IB 4X2) which Funvee has, whereby the centre is low floor. It makes no sense for Transnasional to buy Euro 4 buses when the law in Malaysia doesn't mandate them to do so.</p>

              <p>Then it would be K310EB. However, it would be unwise to fit a DD
              coach with such a small engine. I've taken a coach that lacks
              engine power and climbs a genting hill. All other coaches
              overtooked us, including a Scania K124IB 3 axle DD with 420bhp
              12litre engine. The bus i took was an old MAN coach.</p>
              <p>Scania Singapore offers coaches with 12 litre engines, mainly
              Scania K340IB, K380EB and K380EB (6x2).</p>

              <p>First thing, you have to remember that the bus is registered in Malaysia. As we have know it, their regulations does not restrict new commercial vehicles to be Euro 4-certified. All their new Scania buses are only Euro 3, including the Genting Transport's K270UB.</p>

              <p><br>Do take note that now is the transition period of sunlight. No matter how it is, you will failed by using a compass. And for ISO and shutter speed settings, you got to experience it yrself. It requires ones understanding of ISO, shutter speed and even aperture value to set a balanced setting.</p>

Some people just need more chances, and we should try to be as forgiving to those people as possible, and at the same time, PM or MSN him/her to make him/her wake up his/her idea..</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. </span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why must it be a moderator that does it?

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">9. </span><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">It's not like SBS2695H created a thread for the sake of creating one, but he actually posted pictures in his first post.

              <p><br>I refer to the above and all other related posts made in this thread since the start.</p>
              <p>This junior/senior barrier MUST be abolished because contradictory to the aim of the "seniors" to integrate and unite Singaporean bus enthusiasts through common online sharing platforms etc, this very barrier actually hinders the progress of such an initiative.</p>
              <p>Yes, some may retort "What barrier is there in the first place for us to abolish?". It may well be because you are already among the ranks of the "seniors" for quite some time so much so that you have grown accustomed to "educating" the "juniors" to have lost touch on how you yourself felt when you first joined the group, having to bow to whatever rules and regulations that existed back then.</p>
              <p>For instance, I clearly recall being strongly against the rule prohibiting photo taking of buses in bus interchanges. "For your own safety", "not allowed by bus operators" and others became the basis for such a rule. IRONICALLY, I still saw "seniors" posting photos of buses they snapped at bus interchanges. "Oh, this was a rare cameo, so it's okay" was the standard reply. And was the "senior" reprimanded by the others? Oh no. They got away scot-free. But when a "junior" does it, woah, five pages of flaming would snowball. So just what basis is there for the "seniors" to have the "right" to take photos in bus interchanges just because the bus is a rare cameo? That it is no longer a bus and hence, is okay to be snapped in the interchange?</p>
              <p>So what does this show? To the "junior" who has to abide by every single rule, the "senior" has more power, more control, hence more superior. The divide has already, unknowingly, been created. And it has been expanding since then. And this is just but one of the handful of examples of how such a "junior-senior" divide exists.</p>
              <p>Yes, I acknowledge and applaud the teaching, reminding approaches from all parties which would definitely help the "juniors" integrate well into the community. But please, while doing it, spare a thought. Be in their shoes, consider the stage of interest in the hobby they are still in at such an age when the child is still in the process of transforming into an adult. If repeated warnings are ignored, then yes, by all means, teach them the hard way. Delete all their unproductive contributions, ignore them whatever. Let them learn the hard way, eg, get caught by the security personnel themselves for "breach of safety in the bus interchange by photo-taking". To only continue flaming them in public, already knowing they won't absorb whatever you are saying, will only make matters worse, if not stagnant.</p>
              <p>So there is clearly no basis for flaming this kiasu SBS2695H this time round for starting this thread since he has the content - and thus the reason - to do so, regardless of time. It is NOT as if there was a rule in the first place clearly indicating who can or cannot start new topics for discussion; which the mods may want to take a look into.</p>
              <p>To 997A, does an Oct 08 photo thread CANNOT contain photos of buses taken at any other time? What bull is that?</p>
              <p>And SBS2695H, if you are going to go through so much trouble of having to use COMPASSES just to take photos of buses for a few minutes (or maybe hours for your case), then maybe you may find greater interest taking up field camps and navigation sessions as your hobby!</p>
