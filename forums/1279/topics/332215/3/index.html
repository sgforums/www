              <p>Then may I know who would dare to create a monthly thread if
                      anyone that does so is scolded? A "senior" or a moderator? If its a
                      senior, then this will be a vicious cycle, because the seniors will
                      always see themselves as "seniors" and the younger/lesser
                      experienced ones as "juniors", then these "juniors" will never have
                      the chance to <strong>learn</strong> or for that matter,
                      <strong>show their knowledge</strong> <em>(if they're better than a
                      senior)</em>, because they are limited by the scope of the
                      "senior". It's like the theory of <em>"a student cannot be smarter
                      than the teacher, or someone of a higher qualification level."</em> A <strong>"junior"</strong> member here to shows his knowledge is
                      treated as <span style="color: #666699;">"showing off"</span>,
                      while a <strong>"senior"</strong> member here that shares the exact
                      same thing is <span style="color: #666699;">"sharing his
                      experience</span>". A <strong>"junior"</strong> member here that
                      posts/starts a thread or posting in a certain topic is seen as
                      "kiasu" while a <strong>"senior"</strong> member here that does it
                      is seen as perfectly alright and okay. A "<strong>junior"</strong> member here that does something wrong such sharing the wrong bus
                      schedule  is seen as having committed a grave mistake that is
                      horribly "wrong", while if a <strong>"senior"</strong> member does
                      it, its seen as perfectly fine or something that can just be looked
                      over upon - oh, how ironical. It's like as if the senior members
                      prowress over the juniors - which will always stay as a junior in
                      their eyes.</p>
              <p>If the moderators create it, wouldn't they be
                      <strong><em>Kiasu</em></strong> then? Besides, as a whole forum, it
                      wouldn't matter who creates the threads. If someone is so free as
                      to create a thread for a new month, so be it then. Why must it be a
                      moderator that does it? A moderator is one who takes care of a
                      forum, not runs the forum. A forum is dead if it just contains
                      moderators - essentially, <strong>members</strong> run the forums
                      themselves based on self-moderation. Moderators are here to make
                      sure nothing goes wrong and to deal with the occasional
                      troublemakers - it's like a government and its people.</p>
              <p>It's not like SBS2695H created a thread for the sake of creating
                      one, but he actually posted pictures in his first post. If he did
                      it like in the past months where he just posted without any
                      pictures, then yes, I fully agree with you that, that may be a
                      problem.</p>
              <p>We need to stop <em>squabbling</em> about all these. We aren't
                      any better if we look at how we give <em>"second chances"</em> to
                      SBS2695H/TTS/whoever else that the "seniors" deem irritating.
                      Whilst I'm not a senior (as per the current forums context of the
                      word senior) or whatsoever, this is definitely not the way to go
                      still.</p>

              <p>Okay... Let me enlighten and answer back your questions 1 by 1...</p>

A "senior" or a moderator? </span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">I do not mean that the 1st post must be a senior or moderator in every thread. Basically everyone has the rights to make the 1st post in any thread. It is just that whether they have the attitude of being KIASU or not.. This kind of thing, over the months we all can observe and roughly know who are the ones who have this kind of attitude.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; "><span style="font-weight: bold;">If its a senior, then this will be a vicious cycle, because the seniors will always see themselves as "seniors" and the younger/lesser experienced ones as "juniors", then these "juniors" will never have the chance to </span><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; "><span style="color: #0000ff;">learn </span></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">or for that matter, </span><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; "><span style="color: #0000ff;">show their knowledge</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span><em style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; "><span style="font-weight: bold;">(if they're better than a senior)</span></em><span style="font-weight: bold;">, because they are limited by the scope of the "senior". </span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">I also hope not to see any such barriers as juniors and seniors, and to be judged (be it biased or not) whether he/she is qualified to be senior or junior.. I hope the juniors here do not be limited to what they can do in this forum, but also, they should also not go to the extent that it's really too much for all of us here to tolerate..</span></span></p>

Some people just need more chances, and we should try to be as forgiving to those people as possible, and at the same time, PM or MSN him/her to make him/her wake up his/her idea..</span></span></p>

              <p>Since i'm always give high standards of photos, aren't i trying to teach some of you here nightshots? Eg. SBS233X, sbs&amp;tibs, -beehoon. All of you can even see newcomers like "-beehoon" able to take nightshots many times better than alot of you, not to say even dayshots.If you are willing to learn, why not? It's just that some stick to their stands due to stubbornness.</p>

All of you can even see newcomers like "-beehoon" able to take nightshots many times better than alot of you, not to say even dayshots.If you are willing to learn, why not?

              <p><br>To learn how to take good shots, I believe you can't just look at other's up to standards pictures to get a good shot. You need really lots of time to experiment with shots, regardless of being night or day shots which is what I will try to be doing in 9 days time or during the Novermber/December holidays. To learn from one another, I suggest that those with high standard photos list down their ISO setting and shutter speed setting with the pictures so that other can follow and take good shots. For working with sunlight, I have thought of an idea which is to use bring along a compass with you and face the different side of the road at different times of the day. In the morning, make sure the bus faces the East direction where the sunlight comes from. In the afternoon, make sure the bus faces the West direction when the sunlight will start to shine from the West.</p>

              <p>Aha... Such cases like SBS2695H and TTS, are really too extreme that is way beyond our control and tolerance level, and it's like no matter how nice or nasty we tell them, they are still going to be like that in the end... It's really the attitude and the willingness that whether you guys here want to learn well or not.. Like what Simple_boi has mentioned, if they still insist of being stubborn, then no matter how much we tell/flame/scold them, to them, it's like "1 ear in, 1 ear out" and forget about it. In such cases, what we can do is just ignore them, since we also don't want to waste our time energy typing here to tell/flame/scold a wall. (If you get what I mean by the word "wall")</p>
              <p>Now you know why I don't keep scolding them over here.. No point wasting my energy typing and in the end nothng is being done on their part..</p>
