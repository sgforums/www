              <p>waste of money.... cos need to update the bus stop pole, the bus stop information panel etc etc... too much trouble... if that particular bus stop have 10 services, then all the bus stops that these 10 service pass by must also update for the information panels...</p>

              <p>Why need the bus stop name for what? In the past, bus stop served do not have names. SBS Transit updated their board with the bus stop name and their services at that stop. SMRT does a makeover on its PIS showing the next bus stop names and "bus stopping". change? Is it because SBST started it? Is it because SMRT PIS showing those? Is it for both reasons so LTA followed?</p>
              <p>Yes, you can live with all the outdated bus stop names. Sure, you can say x stops after bus turning right at that junction. But if, some of the bus stop have updated names, while some others have not, then why? This is inconsistent, right? Someone is slacking or sleeping on the job? Retain some history?</p>
