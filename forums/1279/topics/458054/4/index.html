              <p>Bro, did you get my point? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> I'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> implying 9849K is directly replacing 1932E uh~ I'm asking you check if 9849K is replacing 1932E's timing or some other bus' timing.</p>
              <p>Cause Sv 69 now has only 3 non-WABs reflected in wiki, but '2615P' clearly stated e-tt still says there's 4 non-WABs. If you can find the missing non-WAB, then probably can explain that 8603J &amp; 8662M probably aren't perm 69 at all? 1932E's replacement should be a non-WAB, but don't think its 9849K. Which means 9849K is replacing another bus if i'm not mistaken?</p>
              <p>Besides, I really can't find what bus goes in Sv 8 lately to replace 8662M?</p>

              <p>I think they are doing mass-extension. Cause the next batch after the 12 Dec batch is the 25 Dec batch. Think they are extending both batches at one shot in the next few days. </p>

              <p>You mean the next batch?</p>
              <p>IMO, <strong>1969A (BN 81), 1972P (BN 21), 2622T (BN SP, ex-BN 518).</strong></p>
              <p>2622T is almost confirmed de-reg early given they repainted &amp; refurbed all the way up till 2624M already (2624M's latest repainted livery covers the former gloss-stickered one). Blue seats, grey ducts for 2622T, plus high mileage from doing 518 all this while its siblings like 2620Z &amp; 1896B all left 518 way before. </p>
              <p>1969A is the same case as the non-extended 1960Z (like you posted above). Both have yellow seats, but those were from the IMF-era. 1969A's seat backs are disastrous since transferring from BBDEP, always been the case. The painted seat backs are macham brush-painted, some are grey, some are dark-blue. Plus 1969A still grey A/C ducts as of what I know.</p>
              <p>1972P that one might be possible early de-reg, but personally I hope it's extended. Possible because somehow they never repaint this bus but they repainted both 1973L &amp; 1971S (1971S is bumpers &amp; roof only), but 1972P IIRC didn't even its bumpers repainted, it's still in gloss-stickered form. The red A/C ducts for 1972P are from years ago IIRC, one of the earliest Striders to get refurbed red AC ducts.</p>

              <p>Uh yeah, 1969A has been in that state of condition since being transferred over from BBDEP to Sv 81. Not saying that BBDEP's maintenance is substandard, but somehow 1969A is just the worst of the lot. 1960Z fared much better IMO even though it was also from BBDEP to BNDEP.</p>
              <p>1969A's gearbox is also quite disastrous months back. Not too sure if it was repaired latey cause I haven't boarded it much, but its gearbox was like trembling &amp; shuddering at coasting rpm, not even floored. I would say almost the same case as 1929R's gearbox problem.</p>

              <p>The refurbishment works seems to be until the 262x series &amp; beyond already..those before the 26xx series &amp; yet not repainted in any way even though they are adless (either bumpers &amp; roof only, or entire body), those are the ones likely to early de-reg.</p>
              <p>Last time it used to be that Mk4 DMs &amp; Striders on services with high demand have a higher tendency to be left in stickered livery, but then again, it doens't hold now. Just look at the number of Striders repainted on Sv 33, 66 etc when these services do have relatively high ad demand.</p>

              <p>2623R is already repainted, no? Seems weird. This bus might be a backlog of refurbishments. Might. They haven't painted the rear SBST words remember? </p>
              <p>2603Z lacked the rear words right after repaint a few weeks before. Then recently, they painted the rear SBST words. So 2623R might be a backlog or something. Hmm. </p>
