At this period, SBS was experimenting with several models of a/c buses. This was an experiment to see if it was feasible to convert old buses into a/c buses. It was also during this period that saw the emergence of the Van Hool B10M, the Renault PR100.2 and the Nissan U31SCN.<br><br>Another reason was that the Leyland Victory as with all other Soon Chow clad buses before 1978 were starting to fall apart. Hence, they were re-fitted with a newer Soon Chow body, as with the case of the OF1417 and Albion Viking (long version). But many Victory still retain the old body (the one with grooved sides) until retirement. They were last used for the Toa Payoh feeder services.</div>
