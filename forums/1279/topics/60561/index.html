As I am around 6 years old when the Renault was taken off, I only know about Mercs and Leylands (since I lived in AMK).<br><br>Special to note that SBS 3572 Y ( "Lynx" ) once served service 24. I only know that the bus went to services 106, 267 and 269. I was lucky to take the Lynx before it was taken off service, somewhere around 1997 - 1998.<br><br>I remembered the MAN 16.240 ( "MAN" ) on service 76. I remembered my mother always saying why this particular bus had such a high chassis. I had always thought the MAN was a Merc until I got much older. I miss the old aircon coaches ( Mercedes Benz O303 ) too.<br><br>Hope to meet up with you too.</div>

The body was not Soon Chow. It was by Metsec (Metal Sections) similar to the commonly seen OF1413 (the one with a front desto that sticks out). The difference was that 6790P had a rear desto. It was a demonstrator bus introduced in 1978 before the coming of the NZMB bodied models the year after. In the beginning, it was used for passenger service on rt. 147. SBS had a knack for turning demo buses into training buses. Maybe one day even 1688K or 2888T might also be turned into training buses?</div>

A Dennis Dominator DDA144 (SBS 7003 Y, East Lancs) and Leyland Olympian ONTL11/2R (SBS 5396 B, Alexander). The Dominator was heading for Hong Kong but it stopped at Singapore for a while so that SBS could do some evaluation. The Olympian was one of the B45 prototype chassis which was fitted with the then new Alexander R-type body. It was featured at the 1980 Motor Show in England before being shipped to Singapore, where it was used on sv. 162 in 1981. This was the bus that led to the 200 NAC Olympians we see today (but not for long). 5396B is now being preserved at the Oxford Transport Museum.<br><br>There were also 2 Mercedes-Benz O305 demo buses. One had a Willowbrook body (SBS 5500 S) and the other an Alexander body (SBS 5541 Z).</div>
