              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Under the contracting model, I don't think LTA will buy buses
              for specific operators, they will make purchases based on their own
              decisions, and would distribute the buses to the operators based on
              the contractual agreements and operational needs of the areas they
              serve in, it is similar to what is being done in London
              (Borismasters only), Perth and Adelaide. And even under the BSEP
              scheme, LTA wasn't the one who made the fleet decisions, as they
              simply funded part of the orders SBS and SMRT made.</p>
              <p>Off topic: The last sentence is why I think sgwiki is
              inaccurate. They have terms such as BSEP Batch 1, 2 and 3 for the
              B9TL Wrights. The fact is the BSEP buses are part of the same
              orders as the regular buses, ie 3300-3329 are actually Batch 2
              Wrights; 3330 to 3448 are actually Batch 3 Wrights and 3449 onwards
              are Batch 4 Wrights, all of which were allocated as BSEP Buses. Of
              course you would know that there is no batch 1 Wrights that are
              under BSEP. The body numbers and to a large extent, the VINs
              confirm this.</p>
              <p>Then I have came across "batch 4" MAN A22s on another website I
              can't remember. Unless SMRT has made an announcement about it,
              there is no such thing as yet. Apparently someone treated the Voith
              A22s as another batch, they are not. Officially, as of today, there
              are only 3 batches of A22s purchased by SMRT, whether or not the
              specification of the gearbox specification changes does not change
              this fact. Always check the official press releases (if there are
              any) before putting up the info.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Reason: There was a similar
              situation 10 years ago here where a bus fan created his own
              designation for a certain type of bus with a different body from an
              earlier batch of buses and rumour was that the manufacturer wasn't
              too happy about it as it led people to think that they had a new
              product. Similarly, these cases could lead people to think that a
              bus company has made additional orders when there were
              none.</span></p>

              <p>Eye catching?  Hmm.  Obvious difference then I suppose.  Maybe different shape of bodywork?  Idk...  or maybe different livery.  Hope one day we will have A95 with black space above the front door (like the KMB/NLB ones).</p>

              <p>I think you do not understand how BSEP works with regards to bus purchasing. BSEP was launched at a time when LTA had little say in bus purchasing, as they probably did not have a team of people set up for this purpose. BSEP involves funding part of the orders SBS and SMRT have made, ultimately SBS and SMRT had the final say in what buses to buy under BSEP. As per press releases, the two stages of BSEP covers 1000 buses.</p>
              <p>Now that we have moved on to the contracting model, LTA will most likely be buying the buses themselves if they are to follow what London and Perth etc are doing. This is not BSEP, but rather part of duties the governent has to take under the contracting model.</p>

              <p>To add on, I just found out from the government directories that LTA now has team of people to take care of bus assets. So from now on, I do expect LTA to be able to make decisions on what buses to buy, and allocating buses to operators. I will not be surprised if the recent transfers of SMRT BSEP buses to Bulim depot may be as a result of this to prepare for the handover to Tower Transit, though this is still a speculation. In such a case, in the future, we are likely to move to a situation like London, Perth etc scenairo where buses are bought by the government and allocated to operators, whether the operators like the choice of buses allocated or not is another matter altogether.</p>

              <p>128B bro is right... MAN is the one pushing demonstrators out to
                              operators, to try to regain the RHD DD market. But it is a
                              difficult task. E500MMC is specially designed and tweaked for the
                              HK market, with steep staircases that allows the highest carrying
                              capacity, and a reliable and familiar 340hp Cummins engine that
                              delivers the torque to climb its many hills.</p>
              <p>Tender results recently have not been in favour of MAN too. NWFB
                              and Discovery Bay newest types will be B9TL Wrights, KMB started
                              taking delivery of steep staircase B9TL Wrights recently, and CTB
                              is just taking in Enviro's and Youngman's. MAN buses have
                              traditionally been associated with New Lantau Bus and Park Island's
                              bus services in HK, but even Sunlongs can overcome their 1:6 slopes
                              in Tung Chung now! The odds are stacked against MAN in HK. Too
                              little, too late. So if the Singaporean RHD market is not huge
                              enough for MAN, you will expect to see them giving up on RHD
                              development after a few years.</p>

              <p>Not really. With the benefit of hindsight, requesting SMRT to trial SMB5888H was IMO a shrewd move. The timing of A95's development and launch could not be better.</p>
              <p>If MAN continues to play its cards right (it seems to be so far), they can fully recoup the A95 development costs, give away all their A95 demonstrators for free and <em>still</em> make a profit.</p>

              <p>See how.  So far only Big Bus has bought Ankais that I remember, and that may be part of a global strategy thing since the Big bus in the rest of the world also bought Ankais.  Yet to be seen how A95 performs as open-top in HK.</p>
