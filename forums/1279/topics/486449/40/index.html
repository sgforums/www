              <p>You mean SG5740,5741 &amp; 5742?Wonder why they're registered under TT in the first place?SMRT &amp; TT seems to be more interesting lately,Lucky Amdep,Wldep,Kjdep or Budep is too far from my home in the East,Else i will be joining them instead though i can ride my motorcycle there.Got an offer from TT before this but again the travelling distance is just not worth it.</p>

              <p>They were there not because SMRT uses the depot to park buses. The A95s, Citaros and Wrights parked in Bulim were stored by LTA. The most probable explanation is that LTA had not decided which operators those buses should go to back when the buses were registered. In fact, more than half of the buses stored there have been released to SMRT, Tower and GA, so it isn't anything to do with SMRT themselves.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure where you heard it from, but it is impossible to know whether LTA has made any new orders for any type of bus, so whatever you hear are just rumours that may not be true. It will be helpful not to spread such rumours, as it can get your sources into trouble.</p>

              <p>They were there not because SMRT uses the depot to park buses.
              The A95s, Citaros and Wrights parked in Bulim were stored by LTA.
              The most probable explanation is that LTA had not decided which
              operators those buses should go to back when the buses were
              registered. In fact, more than half of the buses stored there have
              been released to SMRT, Tower and GA, so it isn't anything to do
              with SMRT themselves.</p>

              <p>have explained before that it is due to insurance and storage space issue.. buses are coming in much faster than it is required (partly due to the slow down of BSEP program as well) and SBST/SMRT depots are bursting...</p>

              <p>I'm not sure where you heard it from, but it is impossible to
              know whether LTA has made any new orders for any type of bus, so
              whatever you hear are just rumours that may not be true. It will be

              <p>Not really, because that does not explain why SBS hasn't received any of those buses in Bulim. and why Go Ahead and Tower received those Bulim storage buses (1051, 1052, 1065-1070, 1011-1015, 5069-5084 for GA, 1020-1029 for Tower*).

              <p>cos SBST used those 53** and 11** buses instead. they are using different series... there are more than 130 of them for SBST since early this year.. </p>
              <p>as for those 10** series and 50** series, most likely they are reserved for BCM used initially (that why SBST use different rego series, even BSEP have different rego series) , but then since SMRT is being owed around 90 BSEP buses by LTA (due to the transfer of BB services) and they are still short of high capacity buses, that why buses are now being transferred to SMRT as well....that why now the rego are like rojak... </p>
