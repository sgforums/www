              <p>TIBS handled SKG and Jalan Kayu quite okay. They had box bendies
              on 82 and 864 (present 80). Even 103 and the old 860 had Hispano
              O405's. The tradeoff was Scania 113's and later Lances appearing on
              167, 851, 852, 853, 855 and 980 but it really got to the worst (en

              <p>If I am not wrong, Lances rolled in at around the time when Tibs
                  opened its 3rd depot at Woodlands in 1998. The Scanias were then
                  under AMDEP and eventually moved to WLDEP, and the newly rolled in
                  Lances took its place in AMDEP.</p>
              <p>855 initially had mainly 0405s in its fleet until when Jalan
                  Kayu went back under SBST, lances from 163 went to 855. Some of the
                  855's 0405s went to 67.</p>
              <p>167 and 851 never had lances until sometime later in 2001, due
                  to the fact that these 2 services were not under AMDEP then until
                  another depot reshuffle took place. 169 was the one that had lances
                  instead.</p>
              <p>103 also got a handful of perm lances too when it was under
                  Tibs, together with 163 and 59/866 (now 86).</p>
              <p>I remembered once Tibs started to take over 190, all the bendies
                  were withdrawn from 82. And also noticed Tibs also anyhow deployed
                  buses on 82 and 103 just before they were returned to SBS in
                  1999.</p>

              <p>In short TIBS werent properly equipped or prepared (even mentally prepared) to operate anything properly outside of their original Sembawang-Yishun-Woodlands territory. When SMRT took over, they werent any better too.</p>
              <p>Lances should never have been on 169. It deserved HC buses from the start. Prior to SBS giving 169 to TIBS in 1984, SBS had been putting at least half DD fleet on 169.</p>

              <p>In this respect I kinda agree with the "industry" wrt SMRT ...
              in fact they should just focus on running the rails properly and
              ditch the bus business. I dont mean to cause hurt to SMRT bus
              drivers, but SMRT management had only managed to show that it is
              capable of only properly managing a bus business of a scale that
              harks back to the TIBS days prior to the Bt Panjang and CCK
              takeover.</p>
              <p>Their recent improvements had been directly due to LTA, BSEP and
              the provision of GreenBus Co buses.</p>

              <p>I agree with you. It's really time for SMRT to give up its bus operations and fully concentrate on its rail operations, like it did in the past. They have been wanting to leave the bus industry before, and now it's the best time.</p>

              <p>It's not just about preference. It's about the industry itself. The bus services market here is too small for too many operators to sustain as this would become a cut throat competition and everyone loses money.</p>
              <p>The market is only this small and a dominant big player is crucial, in case the other small players leaves the market as they deem fit. The competition here is for assistance to the big player to expand and improve bus services here. In case the smaller players exit the market promptly, there is still a big player to fall back on to ensure that the whole system is still running.Â </p>

              <p>Yes, The bendies came in as early as 1997. In 1999 when I was still using 169 to go to work in Woodlands (still no bendies on 169 then), Lances were the norm. Imagine how gleeful I was when I saw TIB931X burn down. I dont think that bus deserved to be burnt down but 169 didnt deserve Lances.</p>

              <p>I didn't say SBST handle rail better than SMRT but at least on par with SMRT, if not better.</p>
              <p>That's for rail. It's different for buses. SBST handled buses better than SMRT. Despite the bigger scale of economies it has served in the past before GCM, their service standards and quality are better and maintain it over the years. SMRT despite given a few places, managed it badly after taken over TIBS, from badly maintained buses, to infrequent frequencies to lack of new bus services to poor overall management, especially under the old management. They simply not interested in operating buses and have been thinking about ditching it's bus operations for years. They only improve recently when the government decides to implement GCM and actually supports GCM as a stepping board to provide bus services without incurring bus assets ownership to reduce the losses in its bus operations.Â </p>
              <p>So it's all about business decisions for both companies, no need to compare who should take over which mode of transport for which company. SBST is interested in bus and rail operations and it made profits out of both. SMRT is more interested in rail operations as it helps to reap huge profits for it, but not so for its loss making taxi and bus operations. And now the government wants it to fully concentrate to improve on its rail operations.Â </p>
              <p>You are still living in the era of the past. Now is already not which bus company restricted within its boundaries anymore due to GCM. Who can give the best price in bidding, who gets to operate the place. I don't see why SBST can't take over Yishun - Sembawang, if they can offer a reasonable bid. Just like how TT and GA took over some of SBST services. As long as there are bus operators willing to operate bus services and operate at a reasonable bid, it doesn't matter who is the operator. More importantly to the commuters is that fares don't increase, service standards improve.Â </p>
              <p>I do agree that both companies won't collapse because they are all GLCs.</p>

              <p>Never underestimate foreign operators on rail handling..Its up
              to LTA to open biddings for our rail lines.With so many disastrous
              I don't see why it can't put on tender..SMRT and SBST should be the
              main player and let TTS/GAS handle CCL and NEL
              respectivelyÂ </p>

              <p>If LTA really do open up rail line biddings to foreign operators, it would go towards more established foreign rail operators rather than TT and GA.</p>
              <p>TT only operates buses in UK and Singapore. As it is a newly established company in UK, I don't think it wants to invest too much money into other ventures like rail, when it's bus operations is still taking off.</p>
              <p>GA doesnât have a good start in Singapore GCM. They should be more concerned about whether they can continue to operate buses here in future, or replaced by another foreign player.</p>
              <p>Somemore both companies do not have a backing from the govt. They enter Singapore market because start up costs are low due to nature of bus operations and do not have to own bus fleet assets. If operating costs exceeds their expectations, they can just leave the market if they want, once the lease is up.</p>
              <p>The opening of the market here is not just restricted to TT or GA. There are many established foreign players in the world. Problem is, how established they are and what is the right price they are willingly to offer.</p>

              <p>If talking about advantages,why not TTS/GAS find shareholders too?It is unfair to called for since SBST/SMRT got rail/bus/taxis/advertising business</p>
