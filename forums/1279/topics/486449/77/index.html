              <p>What I mean is why do smrt want to swap 856 / 857 enviro 500 for
              a95 then ? Enviro 500 on those routes seems to be doing fine but
              why smrt want to deploy more A95 rather then envrio500 ? Those a95
              in the 1st place belongs to 854 / 969 . </p>

              <p>Again stop taking my words out of context. Never had I said 960 fleet sucks in capacity. I only said that the presence of E500s should be a good thing by itself since it has a PIS unlike the B9. I'm saying that for each E500 someone here dreads to get, there are other svcs whose DDs doesn't even have PIS. I do not deny that 960 is healthy with its fleet of DDs. And just coz the B9s suck doesnt make 960 an incapable service in terms of capacity. Its just that its ridiculous to have A95 v E500 when HELLO there are worse buses like the B9??</p>
              <p>And yes I'm proudly anti-SBST and all its accompanying attributes. Would be appreciated if you'd stop digging up the past and intimidate me with it. What good does it do for you anyway?</p>

              they should just focus on running the rails properly and ditch the bus

              management had only managed to show that it is capable of only properly

              <p>TIBS handled SKG and Jalan Kayu quite okay. They had box bendies on 82 and 864 (present 80). Even 103 and the old 860 had Hispano O405's.

              <p>If I am not wrong, Lances rolled in at around the time when Tibs opened its 3rd depot at Woodlands in 1998. The Scanias were then under AMDEP and eventually moved to WLDEP, and the newly rolled in Lances took its place in AMDEP.</p>
              <p>855 initially had mainly 0405s in its fleet until when Jalan Kayu went back under SBST, lances from 163 went to 855. Some of the 855's 0405s went to 67.</p>
              <p>167 and 851 never had lances until sometime later in 2001, due to the fact that these 2 services were not under AMDEP then until another depot reshuffle took place. 169 was the one that had lances instead.</p>
              <p>103 also got a handful of perm lances too when it was under Tibs, together with 163 and 59/866 (now 86).</p>
              <p>I remembered once Tibs started to take over 190, all the bendies were withdrawn from 82. And also noticed Tibs also anyhow deployed buses on 82 and 103 just before they were returned to SBS in 1999.</p>
