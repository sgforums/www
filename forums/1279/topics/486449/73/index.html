              <p>Today saw nearly all 856 buses are A95 + some units of bendy / E500 . Where did all of 856 E500 went ? No wonder 854 so less A95 units Cus 856 steal them all . Yes 854 has A95 but the no of A95 deploy is getting lesser . At the very beginning 854 got almost 12-14 unit of A95 now it's down to about 6-8 units or even less . And also 854 need More DD not bendy not SD more DD . Whether or not Smrt will revive all 122 batch 3 A95 is yet to be seen . I suspect Smrt will receive some batch 3 A95 but not all of them . </p>
              <p>And also I always saw 856 with 2 buses back to back , even with double decker . </p>
              <p>And yes this is my rant about how Amdep poorly treat 854 like deploying SD SD SD , some bendy some DD . </p>
              <p>Yes . 856 has more people due to it passing by a checkpoint and some bangala home but it doesn't mean it need ALL DD units . Bendy can do the job too . </p>
              <p>People using 854 are likely to travel very far like from Yishun area to Eunos area or something similar . What they need is a Bus with many seats therefore they don't have to stand for all the way . Trip like this may take up to 45-55mins . Try stand for that long after a long day at work . </p>
              <p>People using 856 are most likely to alight at woodland check Point and maybe some bangala home . What 856 need is a bus with many doors to facilitate the alighting and boarding of passenger fast as many passenger have the same destination  ( woodland checkpoint ) </p>

              <p>In fact 854 fleet had been doing quite fine for that few weeks after KJDEP moved its B1 A95 over to supplement AMDEP. But ever since the BCM took place, 854 fleet had been slowly going back to hell NWAB spam again especially during weekday peaks.</p>

              <p>There is no need to for AMDEP to take in ANY B9s. When the habits leave so will the Yishun feeders and intratowns. They are doing perfectly fine with the DD fleet now. They are currently the only depot to handle every single Mercedes variant alive in Singapore — don't make their jobs even harder.</p>

              <p>You're not getting my point. I just dont understand WHY a depot must be spammed with so many makes considering SMRT is alr at a disadvantage of having to juggle between so many makes. Why can't we do the same to, say, GA? SMRT has had enough alr. </p>

              <p>SBST used to have this kind of fleet deployment too since the 80s where there were Merc OF1413/OF1417 for 1 depot and Albion Viking/Volvo B57 for the other. The trend continued on in the early 90s with the Merc 0405s, Scania N113CRB and Volvo B10M MK2/3/4 fleets.

              <p>I take 854 everyday to and fro from work.</p>
              <p>I think 854 has already improved a lot since last year. Based on current deployments, the WAB % is definitely being met and 854 has more DDs than Bendies these days. The DD fleet is kinda varied everyday but still most of the DDs are A95s. Also, 854 has enjoyed more high capacity fleet deployments in recent times, most of them are DD. The old NWAB bendies that remain on 854 are those that perm 854 and most of these only appear during peak periods. In time to come, when the Batch 1 O405G Habits retire, 854 will replace with the newer buses with the remaining bendies being pulled to feeder services. Hopefully the new ones will be A95 and not those B9TLs</p>
              <p>We already know SMRT is gonna use these buses till the end of lifespan. The buses still function well and serve high capacity, WAB % for 854 is not threatened. So.. no big issue.</p>

              <p>Actually, 854 fleet start improving only once AMDEP took in the B1 A95s from KJDEP at a later stage. Before that I still dun see much changes even when the new B2 A95s start coming in last Sept (most of the A95s keep doing 969 then).</p>
              <p>From my observations, I still do see like 8-10 NWABs running on 854 running on weekday peak hours. Whereas at noon tend to have about 2-3 NWABs running only. At night seems only WAB running.</p>
              <p>For weekends, there are roughly about 3 NWABs on Sat and probably 1-2 on Sundays. I remember one occasion whereby 854 had full WAB fleet on Sunday.</p>
