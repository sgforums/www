              <p>Yeah,No point pasting SMRT Livery,They should just paste the green livery.Send 30 each to TTS,GAS and SMRTB.If LTA order more than 100 units can also give to SBST.</p>

              <p>Not only limit to TT but also to GA.SMRT can keep on using those 21 units of E500s after the transition..Can give 7 units each to Wldep,Kjdep and Amdep.</p>

                              <p>28 May is seven weeks from today.</p>
                              <p>According to Tower Transit Facebook page, Tower Transit says that 10% of its bus fleet is reserved for deployment in case of service delays. Tower Transit says that GCM will start with 50 buses from late-May.</p>
                              <p>Of the 50 buses, I guess 5 are reserved and 45 are for revenue service.</p>
                              <p>Assuming the bus deployment remains the same, the bus services you stated require 75 buses. If this is indeed the first bus services to be taken over, it's likey that around two of them - using up to 30 buses - will be in the second batch instead.</p>
                              <p>If 50 buses are implemented each time, the takeover would be in eight batches. If the implementation is done over eight weeks starting from 28 May 2016, it would go on until 16 July 2016.</p>
                               <p>But the LTA say the takeover would be done in three batches, so it's quite likely that the number of buses implemented each time will increase progressively, as the new operator becomes comfortable with operating the bus services. For example, 50 buses in the first batch, 125 buses in the second batch, 200 buses in the third batch.</p>
                          
                          <p>I feel that it is better to implement only 50 buses each time, over eight weeks, considering this is the first contract. Besides, if there are only 50 buses implemented each time, it may be possible to apply the new SGâ™¡Bus livery on all buses before the implementation. :)</p>
                      <p>The application of the new SGâ™¡Bus livery is likely a combined effort across all bus depots in Singapore, since there are limited painting booths to go around. I do not know how many painting booths are there. I guess around sixteen to thirty-two buses can have the new livery applied in one week.</p>

              <p>think you misread the press release. 50 buses with the green colour ... the rest of the buses that is used would probably be covered up with an LTA or BSEP ad or something just like the current TT training buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They cant possibly paint all overnight, so when they takeover, progressively will paint all green.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>8 tranches is way too long and messy. its still 3. </p>

              <p>The first 20 may be for SMRT. There would probably be 20 each for TT and GAG.</p>
              <p>No need for A95s so early for TT, the current WEGs and Citaros are enough for all of current SMRT services going over to TT, if they add more DDs to 106.</p>
