              <p>5 mins is a huge impact on reliability/frequency. 5 mins would had brought you to Sunset Way. Thats also a whole 3 mins longer than the 184 (more than twice the amount of time than the bendy).</p>

              <p>* Drifting from bendy/DD topic to SD/DD topic *</p>
              <p>A crowded SD often gets more delayed than a DD bus. Observe this
              very frequently on SBS feeders/intratowns that have mix of
              both.</p>
              <p>Reason is simple:</p>
              <p>If SD has around 70 pax on it and packed to door, people will
              find it very difficult to find their way to exit. Also until people
              alight and BC asks people to move in, people cannot board.</p>
              <p>This is different when a DD say is carrying 90 pax. People can
              easily alight while others can board from front door.</p>
              <p>For trunk services, this gets even worse due to distance. Hence,
              we always complain that how DD follow SD. It is because the SD
              slowed down drastically during peak hours loading/unloading and
              then the DD behind catches up.</p>

              <p>SD vs DD isn't a good comparison for this discussion as they have totally different capacities. This was never about SD vs DD. This is about the inefficencies of DDs vs efficencies of bendies.</p>

              <p>Clementi MRT improved after bendies on 106/189 gone? Thats because a good part of SIM was (and is still on holiday). Please observe in a month's time.</p>
              <p>Regarding road space, yes they may jut out sometimes, but because they clear the loads so fast, its still better than having a DD doing the same, which ever so happens at busy stops.</p>

              <p>AFAIK the bus type only dictates 12m or Bendy or DD (LTA will decide how much of which to be used). The 176 move is probably SMRT's move, maybe to meet LTA's requirements, but then again there are still O.405Gs running on Woodlands feeders. Though I don't know why the A24s are chosen instead of the O.405Gs. Just that the wheelchair pax gets disadvantaged, but thats another topic in itself.</p>

              Bendies and DDs have their own pros and cons.
              I will use bendies for short/medium haul svcs like 83, 225, 911.
              I will use DDs for medium/long haul svcs like 118, 161, 291 etc, where most people typically travel from place to place for 10 minutes or more.
              IMO, there should be a mixture of both bendies and DDs.

              <p>Yes, that is the norm for NP/SIM, the students know how to move up, they know all the others are going for classes at the same time. Still with everyone moving up, it still took more than twice as long on a DD than a bendy to do unloading and loading. The 184 bendies are always packed from front door steps to the rear, but are always faster at clearing loads.</p>

              Although i saw the tail of the bendy at the main road because everytime 184 n 154/52 DDs come together 184 tends to give space for the bus to overtake 154 and yes it clear faster coz everybody moving to the back although 184 gets full to the door just like 154

              <p>last time already ask u how many bus stops will have such
              significant boarding/alighting activities but u cant answer.</p>
              <p>you have mention SIM/NP/Clementi Mrt bus stops.. what about
              other bus stops whereby the whole bus load of paxes will alight and
              another whole bus load will board? cant find much also, except for
              some MRT station bus stops (but mostly it is either alighting or
              boarding, seldom will have whole bus load alighting then another
              bus load board)</p>
              <p>For clementi mrt bus stops, not all bus services have
              significant boarding /alighting activities also, (maybe 154 some
              trips/some timing, 184 some trips/some timing)... pls do not tell
              me that every single trips of 184 bendy will have 100 paxes
              alighing at the bus stop...</p>
              <p>for NP/Sim, if during am peak, mostly will be alighting only.
              while for afternoon trips, mostly will be boarding (alighting still
              have, but not the entire bus load).. so basically, the dwelling
              time should be the same for alighting during AM (or lesser for
              DDs).. (assuming  u have 3 DDs unloading 300 ppl together
              compare with 2 bendies unloading 200), or if compare boarding
              activities during PM, 3 DDs will have less dwell time for boarding
              compare to 2 Bendies...</p>
              <p>we still haven compare those bus stops for which 2 DDs can do
              boarding/alighting, but only one bendy can do boarding/alighting..
              (esp for boarding situation only). 2 DDs can board together (assume
              no alighting) and carry 200 paxes in 3 mins? while one bendy can
              only carry 100paxes in 3 mins (since only one door for
              boarding)..</p>
              <p>in your example above, you have assume that DDs have double
              alighting time as compare to Bendies... but in reality, is it
              really double the time whereby paxes can also alight using front
              entrance (so 2 exit for DD compare to 3 exit for bendies).</p>
              <p>Bendies have its own usefulness, but in Singapore, space is an
              issue..<br> to park 300 bendies in a depot, need 50% more space than to park
              300 DDs...same go for interchange... </p>
              <p>LTA should throw some DDs on those intratown/SMRT feeders to see
              whether paxes will go upper deck or not since SMRT is now using
              their MAN A24 on long haul route instead of
              feeder/intratown... </p>

              <p>It is impossible for upper deck to alight from the front when you have all the boarding pax already clogging the entrance/corridor. There. </p>
              <p>You also must take into account the walking time for the stairs. It is human nature that walking DOWN a flight of stairs will always be a slow activity since people will take extra precaution (unlike up a stairs or on flat surface). </p>

              <p>I have raised this before by referencing to the trams in HK. When proper infrastructural and operational design has successfully created a singular flow across the tram. </p>
              <p>These included programming the card readers, placing seats towards the exit direction (which then requires people to board from behind instead), and deliberately having pax board and alight simultaneously. </p>

              <p>I absolutely disagree. DDs on 222 and 291 have a lot of people
              on upper deck. In fact, 222 DDs from Chai Chee are almost full
              upper deck. Same for 291 DDs during peak hours. Those taking bus at
              st 32/33 or st 8183 end up going upper deck. </p>
              <p>For that matter, look at one of shortest routes 225G and 225W.
              They have pax going upper deck. I had posted upper deck full pics
              of both the services as well. It is just a mindset change in SMRT

              <p>Also, why do you think 13A has DDs deployed even though it is
              only 2-3 stops from Bishan St 22 to Bishan MRT. It is because
              people go upper deck and 13A DDs can take in 80-90 pax easily

              <p>People still think that DD vs bendies is just a matter of doors which is honestly a very shallow way to look at the issue given how on a bendy people could move INTO the b<span style="line-height: 1.231;">us while others move OUT towards the exit doors </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(people largely move in the same </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">direction throughout). Instead of having a horizontal human wall that blocks access to not only the upper deck, but also the rest of the lower deck.

              <p>Indeed. </p>
              <p>This was also why 222 takes mothe<span style="line-height: 1.231;">rly long to unload. Every single
              day!</span></p>
              <p>People still think that DD vs bendies is just a matter of doors
              which is honestly a very shallow way to look at the issue given how
              on a bendy people could move INTO the b<span style="line-height: 1.231;">us while others move OUT towards the exit
              doors </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(people largely
              move in the same </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">direction throughout). Instead of having a
              horizontal human wall that blocks access to not only the upper
              deck, but also the rest of the lower deck. We are also talking
              about the FLOW of passengers in determining the layover time for
              each bus. </span></p>

              <p>Doesn't matter bro... LTA decision to have bendies out. Will be left with very few island wide. So now going forward discussion will be DD v/s SD.</p>
              <p>Also SMRT itself has moved its A24s from feeders to trunks. Most SMRT routes have more SDs spammed than bendies even though they have super high loading. In such case, I prefer that there are DDs instead of spamming SDs.</p>

              <p>That's great news. Thank you for sharing the update.</p>
              <p>So totally we will have 182 MAN DD buses. Happy to see this as I was getting bored of seeing so many B9TLs. Some variety + the MAN A95s look super awesome.</p>
              <p>My favorite DD shape and design by far.</p>
