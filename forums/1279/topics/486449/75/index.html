                                      totally fine.</p>
              <p>Having 8 perm NWAB bendies out of 29/30 buses is acceptable -
                                      look at those WAB feeders with more than 50% nwab fleet.. And based
                                      on spottings by various people, 854 also seems to be having quite a
                                      number of DDs the past few days, at least 10 A95s spotted on
                                      Thursday</p>
              <p>A22 vs OC, does it matter? Both are WAB buses the average
                                      commuter will not bother. Besides OC has a higher passenger
                                      capacity, so shouldnt OC be preferred over A22 actually for a
                                      service like 854?</p>

              <p>I observe 854 fleet today, TERRIBLE!!! It seems like SMRT is neglecting 854 again. There are STILL at least 6 NWAB today even though it is a weekend, with 3 CONSECUTIVE NWAB at around 2pm timing along HG area towards Bedok.Â </p>
              <p>Seriously I dun understand... Why AMDEP can't just take in more new DDs and enhance 854 fleet first, instead of KJDEP keep taking them in to pamper CCK services that are already full fleet WAB?? I feel that 854 is currently the worst treated WAB trunk fleet now, ever since 960 got its fleet upgrade. Also, AMDEP should just give 854 designated perm DD fleets instead of giving any random buses. AMDEP should also stop showing favoritism on those ex-WLDEP services!</p>
              <p>Understand that there are many new B3 A95s that had been delivered to SG already and I dunno what is keeping them from coming out on the roads. The June 2000 old bendy batch can prepare for retirement liao.</p>
              <p>I really want to see 854 get the new batch of A95s in time to come.</p>

              <p>6NWAB Bendies does not make 854 fail its WAB criteria. With just 6 NWAB buses, I'm very sure more than 50-60% of the buses are WAB. According to SGwiki, there should be 24 buses being deployed on AM-PM and TQ shifts. I take 854 everyday, 2NWAB bendy back to back is a very rare occurrence and even when that happens, it is usually at peak hour where the subsequent WAB bus is very near. So I do not see any problems.</p>
              <p>anyway, like Sbs6750e said, treasure the old bendies before they say goodbye. I will still rather have a bendy than A22 or worst still, Citaro. When SMRT gets more DDs to replace the retiring Bendies, atleast 854 can get DDs instead of SDs. Most important for 854 is HC buses.</p>

              <p>854 has been doing well this past few weeks . I travel on 854 very often and I find that the WAB DD are well deployed . Sometimes I can see up to 9 A95 DD at night after peak hours . Yeah 9 DD after peak hours . But sometimes only 5-6 DD ( A95 / E500) . Amdep is not consistent in deploying their buses .Â </p>
              <p>Enjoy those bendy while u can ? Nope thanks . I rode those bendy for nearly 9 years liao so it's embedded into my blood already . Would rather want new A95 / Oc500le .Â </p>
              <p>Observations of 854 on Friday Â ( 5 / 5 / 2017 ) ( 6-9pm )Â </p>
              <p>A95 - about 8-9 of themÂ </p>
              <p>E500 - 1or 2 of themÂ </p>
              <p>OC500LE - 4-5 of themÂ </p>
              <p>A22 - 5-6 of themÂ </p>
              <p>Bendy - 2-3 of themÂ </p>
              <p>Weekdays doesn't look so bad . But sometimes amdep will fucked up and 854 will get almost 9-10 bendys rather than DD .</p>

              <p>I agree with <a href="/users/326371">Formususeonly</a>, past few weekdays 854 did quite well, and there were at least 6-7 A95s spotted on Thurs. Somehow AMDEP screwed up 854's fleet today yet again that rather pissed me off (forgive me forÂ the way IÂ postedÂ earlier on).</p>
              <p>Yes I agree around 6 NWAB still ok, but that is provided it is during the weekday peak hour. But having 6 NWAB today (which is a weekend and normally lesser buses) is definitely a no-go for me. My weekend expectation is to have lesser bendies as possible and more DDs (at least 75% WAB criteria met). Worse till 3 consecutive NWAB at YCK Road towards Bedok is still happening on a weekend. Seriously what is SMRT doing??</p>
              <p>Compare 854 with other WABÂ trunk service with HC, I notice that 854 is still way below standard. 854 still can have as many as 6 NWAB whereas other services like 169 have only about 2-3.Â 960 used to be worse off but it had improved alot after the WEGs came in. 963 no need to say, SMRT had been pampering this service alot ever since SMRT brought in DDs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am going to rant about 854 deployment again . 854 on this few days have been using more and more SD . What worst is that all those spare Enviro 500 ( taken out from 856 / 969 / 857 ) are appearing on 854 . While 854 A95 buses are taken away to replace those missing Enviro . Hello smrt ! Why do you want to swap buses here and there in the 1st place ? 856 / 857 cannot use Enviro 500 bus is it ? Must use A95 bus huh ? What bullshit crap are you thinking ? Swapping buses here and there ? 856 need full fleet A95 DD meh ? Enviro cannot do the job ah ? 854 last time was mixed fleet enviro &amp; A95 but now enviro buses has been on the rise and A95 buses decrease. Â F*** you smrt for your rubbish deployment and only favour those money making routes . ( 854 is also a money making route with full capacity on peak hours on weekdays )Â </p></div>
