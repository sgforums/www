              <p>Thats is what im thinking too..The original plan is for svc 106 &amp; 189 only but SMRT already short of DDs..So LTA step in and buy those A95s instead for those service and the E500s stays with SMRT.</p>

              <p>In a nutshell, LTA has screwed the entire bus fleet for GCM
              operators..<br> <br> They should have purchase new A22, A95, (E500 if applicable), B9TL
              &amp; O530 buses for those respective companies instead of handing
              some units over from SMRT &amp; SBST.. Those (SMRT &amp; SBST)
              buses can be deployed to other services to meet / improve WAB quota
              or improve the bus services frequency..<br> <br> Even the registration of buses under SG plate is really really

              <p>UK got numbers of MAN/MB buses..Maintenance and repairs is bourne by LTA not the bus companies..Only salary is paid by bus companies beside advertisement that the companies can collect.BSRF incentive also companies can keep.So if you are saying TT/GA from UK they cannot maintain MAN/Merc/Volvo?What logic is that?Then the B8RLE/MAN 18.240/MB Citaro 12m/Scania N230UD in UK who maintain?Bangla people?</p>

              <p>Look at the situation in another point of view, those earlier BSEP-ed buses are actually already under LTA assets since LTA funded SBST and SMRT to buy the bigger fleet numbers 2-3 years ago. Actually now LTA is just taking back what is meant for their future use then, which is now.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">At that point in time (2009 to 2012), it was very clear to LTA that the bus network was not coping well with the old licensing regime where bus companies were losing money (ie bus side of SBS and SMRT), and that disatisfaction with bus services were increasing. Something had to be done fast to solve it, and while the contracting model looked attractive then, LTA needed the time to study and understand the new model. So the immediate action then was to launch BSEP where buses were bought by SBS and SMRT, which both had experience in buying buses. This has now changed with a department in LTA in charge of allocating the assets to different companies.</span></p>
              <p>If LTA had bought more buses now, there would be a lot of wastage, you will have excess buses running around, running in an uneconomical way. Yes, the companies are no longer affected by revenue risk under the contracting model, which means LTA can provide a level of service higher than that in the old regime, however, it is still subjected to LTA's budget, which is basically influenced by the government's fiscal policy, which means excess resources that are not justified will still not be ideal under LTA.</p>

              <p>further to other have mention, there are over 220 buses from bulim packages for SBST, if LTA is to buy new buses... so SBST will have 220 buses left over...yes, these buses can be deploy to other services, but where to find so many BC? where most of the BCs are going to Bulim.... same go for Loyang Package...</p>
              <p>further, the current bus frequency is already quite good for <strong>almost</strong> all the services after addition from BSEP.. there are stll some which need improvement, but it does not need 220 buses...</p>
              <p>also, if you are going to purchase 400 new buses for Bulim, what will be the cost and also the time needed to get all the buses in? and then another 400 new buses for Loyang later this year? </p>

              <p>The delivery would be quite fast because LTA took over SBST's orders. So they wouldn't need to rely only on BSEP orders.</p>
              <p>The first 11 registered B4 Wrights for TT were probably from BSEP.</p>
