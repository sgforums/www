              <p>I find it very hard to agree with the statement in red, to say
              that less bendies = better bus operations is not valid. Just look
              at the feeder services in Woodlands, replacing bendies with regular
              12 m buses means more drivers have to be deployed, and in many
              cases result in more bus bunching, not less. In fact, my
              observation with svc 913 is that its reliability has gone down the
              drain ever since they added A22s into the fleet. So at least, bendy
              buses should be used for the feeder routes ...</p>

              <p>While the rest of Singapore feeder bus services are coping well without any bendies, Woodlands should not be the exception of continuing having poor standards of bus services with tons of bendies clogging the bus interchange and parking areas during operations. </p>
              <p>The statement you quoted in red is a fact with my observations in areas like Yishun, Chua Chu Kang and Bukit Batok. Just how many new bus services are added and how much better the frequencies for current services have improved, with more than half of the bendy fleets removed. Because operators have more buses to have more flexibilities in deployments, and that's the main reason that why SMRT bus can improve in these few years. </p>
              <p>Woodlands on the other hand can be improved like other areas as well. Firstly break up the inflexibilities of bendies with more single and double deckers. Then based on that to determine the loadings and introduce more new bus services to spread out the load of the current feeder demands. Lastly LTA should allocate some of the feeders to another new terminal  near Admiralty MRT station, just like what it did for Tampines. </p>
              <p>I don't see a need to maintain a small fleet of different buses just because of the inflexibilities to change for the better, which  also adds more costs and troubles for LTA to maintain in the long run. </p>

              <p>Firstly it is absolutely untrue that "the rest of Singapore are coping well with DDs". I can tell u that with the exception of a few svcs like 241, 291, 225, all other svcs have faced CHAOTIC situations with DDs (empty upper decks, clogging inside the bus, immensely long layover times due to clogging, and then severe delays due to that, to name a few..) And for the svcs I've named they all either do not ply intermediate MRT stops, or have far distances between stops. </p>
              <p>Next. You talk about flexibility. I ask you: is restricting and fixating into only ONE type, of ONE design, of ONE make of buses for ALL TYPES of bus services in Singapore what you call " flexibility"?! I shudder at your definition. I think that true flexibility only exists when operators train themselves to be able to handle multiple types of buses at once and have more options to deploy each type of buses to what suits each svc best. It is not having a uniform make across the board. That limits service optimisation, especially when in Singapore it is neither all-trunk not all-feeder.</p>
              <p>I feel that it is unfair that you chose to find fault with removing bendies being the solution to messed up scheduling, at the exact same period of time where LTA has also began rolling many other measures to deal with scheduling, most notably the BSRF, which happened on the same year SMRT first procured DDs. Logically speaking, when placed side by side the problems bendies may pose for scheduling are negligible to that of DDs since crowding in the interchange happens during turnaround time, which does not affect travelling time for the commuters. Even in the worst case where there may be congestion near the entrance, it is measly compared to the severe human gridlock that happens so much often along the journey for the DDs, DURING REVENUE SERVICE TIME.</p>
              <p>I guess the real solution to this is, as you have aptly pointed out, to also be flexible in managing these short haul routes themselves. Granted, I concede that some services may be able to cope on the borderline with DDs pumped in. These are the services where boarding and alighting will most likely not concurrently happen on a large scale, services like 800. Generally, the feeder services. For intratowns, however, this will definitely not work until the concept DD comes in. Look at how many times they stop ag the MRT. 812 TWICE. 913 THRICE, of which twice is at an intermediate stop. Human gridlock are bound to happen, and THIS is what REALLY cause scheduling problems. TL,DR: Some svcs can DD, others just absolutely no. I'd very much rather the habits stay on longer for the intratowns, than for the DDs to come in and open a big can of worms.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Neglecting the mindset of Singaporeans or neglecting the mindset of a small group of bus enthusists? If Singaporeans are really neglected, then why more bus services are already improved so much since BSEP and GCM started?<br><br>Instead of keep complaining about how chaotic for some feeders are using double deckers, why not you as a bus enthusist, do something to encourage people to go upstairs instead? As an ambassdor to encourage people to go upstairs, or give more suggestions to the operators or the authories to encourage people to go upstairs, since it has been proven that it is possible that people can go upstairs after some time with the examples of services you gave. No doubt that other areas' feeders may have some problems, it is not as bad as those with bendies in the interchanges. Shorter buses have the flexibity to create a break in between buses, which will allow buses blocked in the queue to pass through into another lane. This is not in the case where long queues of bendies which buses are stuck in berths, parking lots, etc. And this is proven through my observations before and after BSEP/GCM.<br><br>The funny thing is that you don't even want to understand the point of the flexibility that I am conveying.  Flexibility in the Singapore bus operations context means less congestions, more space, lesser long bus queues and shorter buses to allow more maneuverability within the limited areas in the bus interchanges, depots and bus stops, because Singapore, land scarce. Freeing up more space means more buses can park in depots and interchanges, providing more new bus services, improving frequencies of the current ones. And all these are done by LTA and proven to improve overall bus services greatly in Singapore in these recent years.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not the kind of flexibility of choosing more lengths of buses to use as a more important context, because again it has been tested and proven that shorter 12-13m buses are better in deployments, because operators have more buses to play in flexibility, in terms of shifting some buses from service A to service B if service B has higher demands or demanded better frequencies during peak hours and then shift these buses back to service A once the peak timings are over, OR having more buses to introduce another new bus service to ease the loads of services A and B. This would be a less stressful task with an interchange that can, say, park 30 12m buses for bus operators. What's the value add to learn more kinds of buses to drive if the interchange itself is so congested that buses can hardly move within the interchange and there are so few services for BCs to rotate around? If you tell me the flexibiltiy for drivers to know more than one bus service to drive, then I agree with you. <br><br>In the past years, many people find faults of SMRT with screwed up frequencies, not enough bus services, etc and overall screwed up bus operations under SMRT till the extend that SMRT even wants to give up bus operations. Since BSEP/GCM with the removal of many bendies while giving more buses to SBST and SMRT, SMRT bus services have really improved. Also tested and proven that under SBST areas, bus service standards are better with only single and double deckers because SBST has more buses to improve frequencies, introduce more bus services to improve connectivity. <br><br>Sorry but you are wrong on the sccheduling. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">It is in fact better now because there are more buses (and BCs) to spread the loadings and more resting times for BCs and they are more relaxed because run times are now longer, rather than SMRT rushed schedules in the past.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Again your assumption that bendies only caused gridlocks at the entrance is wrong. When Yishun temp interchange was just opened, the alighting berth is always jammed with long bus queues all the way till Yishun Central during peak and waiting time to alight the bus can wait as long as 7-8 mins. I haven't even included the long bus queues after the alighting berths where most buses are stuck to find parking lots with bendies making the queues worse with their length that blocks the lanes and other boarding berths. But w<span style="line-height: 19.696px;">ith more than half of the bendies scrapped by end 2016, the long queues of buses waiting at the alighting berths are almost non existent nowadays and the interchange can park more buses, plus more new service in Yishun after so many years.</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> Woodlands is not better, especially at the alighting berths, with the trailers blocking lane by lane other than the berths. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">While you can argue that double deckers can cause gridlocks by people alighting but the effects are certainly negligible compared to empty bendy buses forming long queues and blocking the way of other buses with their inflexible lengths and create a traffic congestion within the interchange itself. Fact is that situations in interchanges with only single and double deckers are still better than with bendies, tested and proven by SBST for decades and SMRT after BSEP/GCM. And I would like SMRT to continue this way rather than the old SMRT.<br>So it would be more wise that LTA to remove the bendies and let operators like SMRT to improve its bus services instead which is more important, like what it is doing now. If really some feeder is not effective with double deckers deployed, then the bus operators can instead have more single deckers to have the flexibilty to deal with the crowds with better frequencies, OR even better, introduce a new bus service to balance out the loads of the feeder while providing more links to the commuters. That is the kind of flexibility that will benefit all. I do agree that LTA needs to roll out the 12.8m concept double deckers on the feeders or even the 3 door single deckers as soon as possible.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">This is what they are heading. Want to write to LTA if you do not like the changes, but please do so in a more thoughtful manner if you want a better answer from them. We are already lucky that Singapore has brought in proper buses, and the likes of Citaro and B9TLs are already considered good buses if you compare to buses with the neighbouring countries. Want LTA to buy all MIC buses in future? Don't know why people can keep complaining over such trival matters.

              <p>Let's get specific.</p>
              <p><strong>YIS</strong></p>
              <p>800 - DDs okay (but does the loading justify?)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">803 </span>- SDs only</p>
              <p>804 - DDs okay (for st 41/ave 11)</p>
              <p>805 - SDs for now, in future will need DDs</p>
              <p>806 - DDs okay (ave 6)</p>
              <p>811 - DDs okay</p>
              <p>812 - DDs okay</p>
              <p><strong>WDL</strong></p>
              <p>900 - DDs okay (ave 4)</p>
              <p>901 - DDs okay </p>
              <p>903 - DDs okay</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">904</span> - SDs (loading doesn't justify DDs)</p>
              <p>911 - DDs okay</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">912</span> - DDs okay though stops very close from MRT especially on Admiralty side, but if you only deploy SDs, you will need a bus every 02 mins and that will be chaotic. Hopefully A24s are reserved for this service <span style="color: #3366ff;">(08 A24s, 2 DDs, 06 rigids)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">913</span> - DDs won't do very well especially on Admiralty side as bus stops v near from MRT. Unless those from WDL already go upper deck. Again, in future no choice but will have to deploy DD otherwise will have rigids at 02 min frequency. Not practical. A24s should be reserved for this service as well <span style="color: #3366ff;">(08 A24s, 2 DDs, 03 rigids)</span></p>
              <p><strong>CCK</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">300</span> - Most people take bus for ave 4 which is 2-3 stops. DDs won't do v well and A24s is best choice. Already operating at 03 min frequency with majority bendy fleet. If all rigid, will need bus every 02 min. CCK cannot handle already. <span style="color: #3366ff;">(06 A24s, 07 rigids) + DDs on 983</span></p>
              <p>301 - DDs are okay especially for Keat Hong Close</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">302 </span>- I would prefer to continue with A24s simply because st 51 - Yew Tee - CCK Crescent stops are all close and v high loading activity. SDs just cannot manage the load. 302 already operating at 03 min frequency with 90% bendies. SDs will create chaos. 979 has shared some load between YT and CCK Crescent. <span style="color: #3366ff;">(12 A24s, 04 rigids)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">307</span> - SDs are doing okay</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">308</span> - SDs are doing okay. Won't need DDs. </p>
              <p><strong>BPJ</strong></p>
              <p>920/922 - both BPJ feeders will do v well with DDs. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Hence, A24 deployment is:</span></p>
              <p>912 (08), 913 (08), 300 (06), 302 (12), 858 (04 + 02 SP) </p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Neglecting the mindset of
              Singaporeans or neglecting the mindset of a small group of bus
              enthusists? If Singaporeans are really neglected, then why more bus
              services are already improved so much since BSEP and GCM
              started?<br> <br> Instead of keep complaining about how chaotic for some feeders are
              using double deckers, why not you as a bus enthusist, do something
              to encourage people to go upstairs instead? As an ambassdor to
              encourage people to go upstairs, or give more suggestions to the
              operators or the authories to encourage people to go upstairs,
              since it has been proven that it is possible that people can go
              upstairs after some time with the examples of services you gave. No
              doubt that other areas' feeders may have some problems, it is not
              as bad as those with bendies in the interchanges. Shorter buses
              have the flexibity to create a break in between buses, which will
              allow buses blocked in the queue to pass through into another lane.
              This is not in the case where long queues of bendies which buses
              are stuck in berths, parking lots, etc. And this is proven through
              my observations before and after BSEP/GCM.<br> <br> The funny thing is that you don't even want to understand the point
              of the flexibility that I am conveying.  Flexibility in the
              Singapore bus operations context means less congestions, more
              space, lesser long bus queues and shorter buses to allow more
              maneuverability within the limited areas in the bus interchanges,
              depots and bus stops, because Singapore, land scarce. Freeing up
              more space means more buses can park in depots and interchanges,
              providing more new bus services, improving frequencies of the
              current ones. And all these are done by LTA and proven to improve
              overall bus services greatly in Singapore in these recent
              years.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not the kind of flexibility of
              choosing more lengths of buses to use as a more important context,
              because again it has been tested and proven that shorter 12-13m
              buses are better in deployments, because operators have more buses
              to play in flexibility, in terms of shifting some buses from
              service A to service B if service B has higher demands or demanded
              better frequencies during peak hours and then shift these buses
              back to service A once the peak timings are over, OR having more
              buses to introduce another new bus service to ease the loads of
              services A and B. This would be a less stressful task with an
              interchange that can, say, park 30 12m buses for bus operators.
              What's the value add to learn more kinds of buses to drive if the
              interchange itself is so congested that buses can hardly move
              within the interchange and there are so few services for BCs to
              rotate around? If you tell me the flexibiltiy for drivers to know
              more than one bus service to drive, then I agree with
              you. <br> <br> In the past years, many people find faults of SMRT with screwed up
              frequencies, not enough bus services, etc and overall screwed up
              bus operations under SMRT till the extend that SMRT even wants to
              give up bus operations. Since BSEP/GCM with the removal of many
              bendies while giving more buses to SBST and SMRT, SMRT bus services
              have really improved. Also tested and proven that under SBST areas,
              bus service standards are better with only single and double
              deckers because SBST has more buses to improve frequencies,
              introduce more bus services to improve connectivity.<br> <br> Sorry but you are wrong on the sccheduling. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">It is in fact better now because there are
              more buses (and BCs) to spread the loadings and more resting times
              for BCs and they are more relaxed because run times are now longer,
              rather than SMRT rushed schedules in the past.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Again your assumption that
              bendies only caused gridlocks at the entrance is wrong. When Yishun
              temp interchange was just opened, the alighting berth is always
              jammed with long bus queues all the way till Yishun Central during
              peak and waiting time to alight the bus can wait as long as 7-8
              mins. I haven't even included the long bus queues after the
              alighting berths where most buses are stuck to find parking lots
              with bendies making the queues worse with their length that blocks
              the lanes and other boarding berths. But w<span style="line-height: 19.696px;">ith more than half of the bendies scrapped
              by end 2016, the long queues of buses waiting at the alighting
              berths are almost non existent nowadays and the interchange can
              park more buses, plus more new service in Yishun after so many
              years.</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> Woodlands is not better, especially
              at the alighting berths, with the trailers blocking lane by lane
              other than the berths. </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">While you can argue that double
              deckers can cause gridlocks by people alighting but the effects are
              certainly negligible compared to empty bendy buses forming long
              queues and blocking the way of other buses with their inflexible
              lengths and create a traffic congestion within the interchange
              itself. Fact is that situations in interchanges with only single
              and double deckers are still better than with bendies, tested and
              proven by SBST for decades and SMRT after BSEP/GCM. And I
              would like SMRT to continue this way rather than the old
              SMRT.<br> So it would be more wise that LTA to remove the bendies and let
              operators like SMRT to improve its bus services instead which is
              more important, like what it is doing now. If really some feeder is
              not effective with double deckers deployed, then the bus operators
              can instead have more single deckers to have the flexibilty to deal
              with the crowds with better frequencies, OR even better, introduce
              a new bus service to balance out the loads of the feeder while
              providing more links to the commuters. That is the kind of
              flexibility that will benefit all. I do agree that LTA needs to
              roll out the 12.8m concept double deckers on the feeders or even
              the 3 door single deckers as soon as possible.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">This is what they are heading.
              Want to write to LTA if you do not like the changes, but please do
              so in a more thoughtful manner if you want a better answer from
              them. We are already lucky that Singapore has brought in proper
              buses, and the likes of Citaro and B9TLs are already considered
              good buses if you compare to buses with the neighbouring countries.
              Want LTA to buy all MIC buses in future? Don't know why people can
              keep complaining over such trival matters. Normal commuters won't
              even notice or care less if it is a swing out or slide out plug
              doors, as long as they can open or close, or even care of the
              transmission is ZF or Voith as long as BCs don't have to struggle
              with manual gears. If you are so keen on fine tuning of vehicles,
              go get yourself a car. You can tune or do whatever that satisfy
              your needs with your own car. <br> <br> Look, this is what LTA and other agencies, the country, the
              government is heading,<strong>compacting space and squeezing more
              people</strong>, in this small country.   <br> Many people are unhappy with the overcrowding in Singapore since
              there is less space for each and everyone of us. Many have
              different perspectives of unhappiness over GCM, even myself though
              feel that bus services do improved, but I am unhappy with the
              eyesore green livery on all the buses, instead of their respective
              liveries.<br> <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Unless you can lobby all
              Singaporeans to vote against the incumbant, make the population
              reduced to 4.5 million, else suck it up and accept the fact that
              they are breaking up into smaller compact flexible spaces to move
              more efficiently and providing smaller cramped living spaces, in
              order to squeeze more people in this country.</span></p>

              <p>If your idea of a bus enthusiast is to just look at things from a normal commuter perspective then I question the existence of this hobby. Since the only thing you will not deem "trivial" are the things that could have been discussed without SGF anyway!</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">So it would be more wise that LTA to remove the bendies and let
                  operators like SMRT to improve its bus services instead which is
                  more important, like what it is doing now. If really some feeder is
                  not effective with double deckers deployed, then the bus operators
                  can instead have more single deckers to have the flexibilty to deal
                  with the crowds with better frequencies, OR even better, introduce
                  a new bus service to balance out the loads of the feeder while
                  providing more links to the commuters. That is the kind of
                  flexibility that will benefit all. I do agree that LTA needs to
                  roll out the 12.8m concept double deckers on the feeders or even
                  the 3 door single deckers as soon as possible.</p>

              <p>Bendy buses are feasible to operate, but not in its current format.</p>
              <p>If operators have to operate 2 door DDs on feeder routes, try something radical: remove every seat except those on the wheelarch from the lower deck for a sub-fleet of DD buses and deploy them during peak hours only. Make off-peak travel for senior citizens free of charge.</p>
