              <p>Well, with SMRT already making the stand that Bendys for shorter
              routes and DDs for longer routes, it's logical for them to do that.
              The Bendys on the current longer routes have to be replaced by DDs.
              So it can't be a Bendy-to-bendy conversion for all the
              deregistering units. Hopefully the DAFs and Volgrens will also be
              replaced by DDs and not A22s. </p>

              <p>If that's the case go for E500s... u don't need another bus type (MAN A95) just for 16-20 units.</p>

              <p>Maybe wasn't clear..I'm (also) referring to other PPSS that's
              run by other operators. </p>
              <p>Well, 265/285 isn't under SMRT also.</p>

              <p>Sorry about that.</p>
              <p>But whatever, SMRT can only have those BSEP buses transferred to other operators by LTA. They can sell those excess non-BSEP A22s. With that, new A24s or A95s can be ordered in its place.</p>
              <p>However, the main operators are still SMRT and CDG/SBST.</p>

              <p>I have serious doubts there would be A95s under BSEP when LTA
              has already committed to having only four bus models at this point

              <p>LTA might be converting some of the BSEP A22 order to A95 instead.. but maybe limit to 20-30 max? They have limit to 4 model for GCM... but these BSEP A95 can still be deploy on those non-GCM SMRT routes instead .. so no issue.. </p>
              <p>SMRT might be buying some 20-30 units of A95  to cover for the E500s which it have transferred over to LTA. to register under BSEP...</p>
              <p>total 218 BSEP SMRT buses bought.. i have actually speculate that 118 might be A22/100 might be E500 (cos SMRT bought 201 unit - should be 100 BSEP/100 SMRT plus one FOC demostrator). but it seem like that SMRT transferred some 16 units of E500 over to BSEP..(while SMRT register more A22 that time to replace the O405ï¼‰</p>
              <p>dun think the amount of A95 bought is big or else, SMRT will already issue press release... </p>

              <p>Why does it not makes sense for them to order A95s? Mechanically, the A22, A24 and A95 are similar, ie if you open the engine compartment, they are the same except for a few minor differences. Makes it easier for maintenance, you could order parts in bulk, and have a easier time training mechanics, overall it saves costs. And the driver's compartment is also similar, again easier to train drivers on the buses.</p>
              <p>Makes perfect sense for them to have the A95 in the fleet.</p>

              <p>Difference would be that the PPSS scheme is a tender based scheme, ie LTA calls a tender and interested parties submit their bids. This is similar to the larger contracts like Bulim and Loyang where LTA pays the operators to run the routes, while getting the revenue. So in fact, with the PPSS scheme, LTA is getting the revenue that would had been made by SBS or SMRT.</p>

              <p>Completely valid points. However, SMRT already has the MMCs and should just commit to it and not add a new bus type into its fleet, however mechanically similar it is. SMRT having A22s and MMCs is not any more complex than SBST having B9TLs and Citaros.</p>
              <p>If the A95 had existerd earlier, I'm sure that they would have gotten them instead of the MMCs. But now since they have gotten the MMCs, better to stick to it than to buy yet another type of 'new' bus model.</p>

              <p>I do not understand what's your reason for opposing a new type which is essentially similar to existing buses in the fleet. It is a type that doesn't complicate maintenance matters, requires a lot less time to train drivers on, and enables economies of scale to be achieved. All of which enables a company to save a great deal of money and to spend less time and money on various training. SBS is also doing it, otherwise they wouldn't had bought around 1600 B9TLs, 1100 Scanias and 1000 Citaros. The number of MAN buses in SMRT's fleet totals only 693 as of today, much less than the numbers of each of the types SBS operate.</p>
