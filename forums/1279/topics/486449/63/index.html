              <p>IMO they should stop ordering B9s (which are overpriced given
                  the specs they are equipped with btw) and spend their money on the
                  A95.. MAN has much more potential anyway</p>

              <p>Honestly, I believe SMRT definitely need a lot of DDs to replace a total of 154 bendy buses by the end of this year. I'm looking forward to see the DDs dominating 184 for example. To me the B9TLs are still much better than ADLs but I actually prefer A95s in general.</p>
              <p>I was rather surprised at the rate the bendies are going off. 29 MK2s will all be gone by early March, 65 Habits and one Volgren, among which half will be gone within the span of 1.5 months (early June and mid July) and another half will be gone witihin the span of 0.5 months only (second half of August). The remaining 59 Habits all be gone within 10 days in December, especially when 40 of them had their lifespan "shortened" similar to the case of CDGE B9TLs in September 2006. It was one of the greatest surprises I had ever when pursuing the enthusiast feeling of buses.</p>

              <p>I would hate the B9 much less if they are fitted to SMRT specs... I.e. PIS, sliding plug doors and all...</p>
              <p>Actl yknow what, fuck the B9s, never liked them even since the days I was living in HK anyway... Forever underpowered to the ADL and looks ugly as fuck. Was so disgusted when 219X got so many of those in 2006... Was hoping for ADL instead</p>
