              <p>If LTA intends to procure concept buses with an extra door at the rear of each bus, the purchasing costs of this kind of buses are likely to be high.</p>
              <p>Take Enviro500 concept bus as an example. What ADL has to do is shifting the driveline from the near side to the off side. Moreover, since euro 6 engines usually operate at a higher temperature than their predecessors do, ADL has to find enough spaces to equip larger radiators. These imply that the cost of developing a new chassis is likely to be high and so does the retail price of this kind of bus.</p>
              <p>Even if buses of this kind are ordered in bulk, as the case of New Routemaster suggests, the average purchasing cost is unlikely to decrease considerably.</p>
              <p>When it comes to MAN A95 with 3 doors, despite no major modifications of the chassis required, it may not necessarily imply that the retail price of the production batch of 3-door MAN A95 (if any) will be low.</p>
              <p>It is because bus manufacturers, like ADL, usually charge higher for the design and the manufacture of tailor-made buses, like Enviro400 City.</p>
              <p>Although Enviro400 City and E40H MMC share the same driveline, the retail price of the former one is believed to be higher than that of the latter one.</p>
              <p>If LTA wants to improve the layout of buses with cost minimisation, I think purchasing 12.8m double deckers with a large standing area may help.</p>

              <p>If LTA intends to procure concept buses with an extra door at
                          the rear of each bus, the purchasing costs of this kind of buses
                          are likely to be high.</p>
              <p>Take Enviro500 concept bus as an example. What ADL has to do is
                          shifting the driveline from the near side to the off side.
                          Moreover, since euro 6 engines usually operate at a higher
                          temperature than their predecessors do, ADL has to find enough
                          spaces to equip larger radiators. These imply that the cost of
                          developing a new chassis is likely to be high and so does the
                          retail price of this kind of bus.</p>
              <p>Even if buses of this kind are ordered in bulk, as the case of
                          New Routemaster suggests, the average purchasing cost is unlikely
                          to decrease considerably.</p>
              <p>When it comes to MAN A95 with 3 doors, despite no major
                          modifications of the chassis required, it may not necessarily imply
                          that the retail price of the production batch of 3-door MAN A95 (if
                          any) will be low.</p>
              <p>It is because bus manufacturers, like ADL, usually charge higher
                          for the design and the manufacture of tailor-made buses, like
                          Enviro400 City.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Even without the 3-doors...look at the OMV of the 60 A95s. I don't think LTA really had a choice in this instance.</p>
              <p>This is where competitive tender could really play a role on lowering costs for the upcoming tender.</p>
