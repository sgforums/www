              122 units of MAN A95 from STK . All chassis will be shipped by the
              end of 2016 and with complete buses starting to roll out of

              <p>That's nice to hear. Seems like LTA is rounding the purchase to 200 units of A95 in total (1 demo + 16 batch 1 units (earlier source stated 20 but I guess only 16 was acquired in the end) + 60 batch 2 units + 122 batch 3 units + 1 concept). Now I just hope the paint scheme could follow the concept bus/earlier lush green A95s or at least have the windscreen area painted black. It would be nice if they also updated the design to the concept bus style too.</p>

              <p>Doesn't matter bro... LTA decision to have bendies out. Will be
              left with very few island wide. So now going forward discussion
              will be DD v/s SD.</p>
              <p>Also SMRT itself has moved its A24s from feeders to trunks. Most
              SMRT routes have more SDs spammed than bendies even though they
              have super high loading. In such case, I prefer that there are DDs
              instead of spamming SDs.</p>

              <p>I still dont see eye to eye with DDs on feeders... LTA had better speed up delivery of concept buses and order a large fleet of those for use on feeders and intratowns...</p>
              <p>Then sell those LE B9s (not bought over by GCM) and those trashy B2 B9s (LF ones) to other countries... Malaysia perhaps? </p>
              <p>Consider early retirement for CDGE also... Most of them look unfit for another decade of svc anyways</p>

              <p>I have a feeling that the 122 man a95 are for future opeator for Seletar bus package . And also LTA will not order any 12.8m concept bus until 2018 as trial run for the 1 unit 12.8m SG5999Z has not been in service yet . </p>
              <p>The chassis for the new order (122 units) will be progressively made by the end of this year - while the bodywork that gemilang provides will start next year . Earliest arrival of the new batch of buses with complete bodywork and interior is Q1 2017 . </p>

              <p>That's not the point dont you get it. The point is current DDs are not suitable for feeders. Period. When there are better alternatives out there (i.e. tri door) it then does unjustice when LTA DELIBERATELY chooses to neglect the option, or delay its entry. </p>
              <p>Mark my words. LTA never delivers its promises. 2018 is merely yet another empty promise. Our bus system is going to shit with the current bunch of imbeciles in thr office...</p>
