              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, service 85 not really very parallel because it did not go to Punggol field. 3 and 83 are still parallel along Punggol field. Punggol field also has a huge sector of crowds in morning peak. So 3 is more important to have DDs. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>The OMV range of the A95s is comparatively wide. They have quite a latitude to set prices and do respond to the prospect of competition, something I have previously discussed.</p>

              <p>Just to share, I used to be a Friends of Tibs and I attended their dialogue sessions back then in 1998. I remember the Tibs staffs raised concern about DDs that had height constraints and even mentioned about incidents regarding top parts being ripped off. Hence their decision to purchase bulk bendies instead of DDs to boost capacity.</p>
              <p>Whereas for SBST, there were 2 bendies brought in for trial but were eventually sold off due to space constraints or something.</p>
