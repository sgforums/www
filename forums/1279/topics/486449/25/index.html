              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>One of your "good" quality Enviro 500s taken when it was a month
              old. Seems that your comment on things not being fitted properly is
              applicable here.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WHpTzKR.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="4128"></p>
              <p>I think you have to realise asthetics is a separate issue to the
              structural issues that concern the buses. An Enviro may look nicer
              than a Gemilang, but the E500 body structure just doesn't seem as
              strong as even a China bus. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Even China buses don't produce that kind
              of creaks. The bus just doesn't feel as safe as it should be for
              passengers.</span></p>
              <p>Well, the Enviros are still new, we will see what kind of
              condition they will be in when they are the age of the PSV (CDGE)
              B9TLs. And The PSV B9TLs don't have that kind of creaks from the
              body, its a strong body just that it has a vibration
              issue. </p>
              <p>I doubt the Enviro 500 body will last, structually that is,
              regardless of who is assembling it. And have you seen the quality
              of the roof sheeting from above, its atrocious, never seen a new
              bus with such wavy roof before. You want to know why Gemilang and
              Wright doesn't have this? Because Wright and GML don't roll the
              roof sheeting onto the roof structure, the technology used by
              Wright and GML are similar (if I'm not wrong, the Alusussie
              technology), and involves properly and precisely (ie machine)
              bending the metal to its required shape, instead of just rolling a
              sheet of metal and affix it (most likely with SikaFlex) to the roof
              structure.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Let's not talk about the body structure etc., becus all the while I'm referring to the cheap qualities from GML..</span></p>

              <p>Even the black rubber strip on the OCs...it also came out eventually. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="http://oi66.tinypic.com/309j50i.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p>I wouldn't deny that Gemilang still has room for improvement, I have never denied that. But you are lumping everything from quality of materials used, to workmanship to how things look together as a generic indicator of "quality".</p>
              <p>Here is my opinion and observations:</p>
              <p>Materials used: Materials used by GML is better, plastics used look less cheap (not to be confused with the next point)<br>Workmanship (interior fittings): ADL is better (till now so far, we'll see down the road) (this is the point you are pointing out in your post)<br>Exterior Design: No comments/Ambivalent<br>Ride quality (including general feel of sturdiness): GML is better.</p>

              <p>All these while, up till MANs, the GML products were assembled by third parties. The MANs if I'm not wrong, are the first buses for Singapore which GML has assembled themselves, and I think they have improved a lot from the earlier products. I am very confident that they can last a lot longer than you think. They still have room for improvement, and I think they should if they are to grow their business, and I have never denied that.</p>

              <p>I just have to say, Wright wins both, I'm sure that is a given. I'm glad Wright took the plunge back in 2003 or so to enter the far east market. They have brought good quality products to this region.</p>

              <p>Yes, at least you are now on the point. I have never said that the GML workmanship was better than ADL and I'm glad you have seen this point.</p>
              <p>The creaking noise in the video is from the brake mechanism. I believe its from a third party manufacturer as it has been heard on the VDL DB300 and recent Mercedes OC500LEs. If you hear it, it means things are working as they should.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Gemilang have improved a lot in terms of quality. The Lion's City DD bodywork is their quality product so far. The only gripe I have is the metal poles they use, which has a cheap feel to it. Hopefully in the future they can adopt a more premium looking metal pole like those used on the Citaro.</span></p>
              <p>I wonder how the UK Falkirk and Malaysian DefTech assembled ADLs fair compared to those assembled in China by Zhuhai Granton, do they creak that much?</p>

              <p>Same goes for 983...most of the BSEP buses have been transferred away to perm non BSEP services as a majority of their fleet because of upcoming GCM, it does not matter to SBST or SMRT anymore if they are using BSEP buses to perm BSEP services or otherwise since the number of spare BSEP buses in their depots are insufficient...in this case they still have many spare bendies kicked out by DDs, that is why bendies permed 171 and 983 as well.</p>

              <p>Yes, at least you are now on the point. I have never said that

              <p>The creaking noise in the video is from the brake mechanism. I
              believe its from a third party manufacturer as it has been heard on
              the VDL DB300 and recent Mercedes OC500LEs. If you hear it, it
              means things are working as they should.</p>

              <p>Quite honestly, the Scania DD chances in HK and Singapore market are slim. 7888 is more often than not found in the layup corner of amdep and the total number of these buses in HK is small, bearing in mind that it has been available for a good 7 or 8 years; I think the bus operators may feel that there are better products out there. Ride comfort wise, I think the Scania DD is not as good as the other products on the market, very hard suspension. From a personal point of view, Scania citybuses these days don't feel as comfortable to ride in as those in the past.</p>
