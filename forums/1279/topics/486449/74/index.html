              <p>Actually, 854 fleet start improving only once AMDEP took in the
              B1 A95s from KJDEP at a later stage. Before that I still dun see
              much changes even when the new B2 A95s start coming in last Sept
              (most of the A95s keep doing 969 then).</p>
              <p>From my observations, I still do see like 8-10 NWABs
              running on 854 running on weekday peak hours. Whereas at noon
              tend to have about 2-3 NWABs running only. At
              night seems only WAB running.</p>
              <p>For weekends, there are roughly about 3 NWABs on Sat and
              probably 1-2 on Sundays. I remember one occasion whereby 854
              had full WAB fleet on Sunday.</p>

              <p>Yes, your observations tally with mine. According the SGwiki, 854 should still have 8 perm NWAB brandies and like I said most of them are probably on split shifts and thats why they mostly appear during peak hours. Ofcourse there are 1-2 spares that also get deployed. Thats why like I said, 854 is doing well at the moment, meeting WAB quota and having a substantial number of DDs. I rather have NWAB bendy than A22 or OC during peak hours because of the crowds. In time to come, SMRT will probably replace these with DDs anyway. Just have to understand that SMRT will use the old buses till end of lifespan before new buses can come in. </p>

              <p>I'm sorry . SMRT replacing old bus with new ones when the bus lifespan comes to an end . You joking ? Especially for 854 . I been observing 854 since 3 years ago . When 854 0405 was coming to an end I expected them to deploy the new MAN a22 buses on 854 but instead they deploy the kinda old OC500LE . New bus on 854 ? Nope ! Always a old bus that is usually 3-5 years old or more . Just look at 854 fleet history , old buses (OC500LE is about 8 years old ) + crappy deployment that doesn't change . Yes it's have been improved but not to the standard of something like 857 / 969   </p>

              <p>Well, 854 started to receive its perm OC500LE fleets back in 2009 when they were brand new. And I remember how 854 got them was because its perm 0405 fleets got transferred to WLDEP back then (WLDEP did not get any new fleets replacing the outgoing Nissan UDs). 27J 45G 48Z 49X are the ones that had been sticky to 854 since 2009/2010 era till today.</p>
              <p>854 then continued to have several 0405s and most of them followed 854 over to WLDEP when WLDEP took over partial duties from AMDEP somewhere in 2013 (530U 578H 736T 755M). These 4 were eventually replaced by brand new A22s (1451K 1472A 1553U 1554Y 1555U).</p>
              <p>After 854 went back full AMDEP controlled in 2015, AMDEP side continued to deploy A22s together with OC500LEs. It was when AMDEP decided to give 171/851 full A22 fleets, 854 side had all the A22s removed and replaced with ex-171/851 OC500LEs. Kinda lousy move...</p>
              <p>Next thing is AMDEP took in first batch of E500 DDs. Even though 854 received a small number of them, I noticed that 857 keep snatching away most of the AMDEP DDs back then, leaving 854 still left with several old bendies despite being made WAB by then. And I still remember 854 still had such thing like 3-4 (or even more) consecutive NWABs even during off peak. This really made me pissed off and I did made several feedbacks to SMRT despite no improvements made then.</p>
              <p>854 initially did not improve much too when AMDEP took in brand new B2 A95s last Sept, as most of these new A95s keep going to 969 instead. Only some time later when AMDEP took in B1 A95s from KJDEP, then I started to see improvements in 854 fleet. Appreciated that. I still notice NWABs running though but not too much already during off peaks. Looking forward to see them go off and replaced with B3 A95s.</p>
              <p>Just my point of view though.</p>

              <p>857 did not have any perm bendy before. But there used to be several random bendies doing 857 on a weekend basis, probably to cater for the Little India weekend crowd.</p>
              <p>Think this weekend deployment is no longer practiced ever since 857 received DDs.</p>

              <p>Based on observations here recently regarding 854, it is doing totally fine.</p>
              <p>Having 8 perm NWAB bendies out of 29/30 buses is acceptable - look at those WAB feeders with more than 50% nwab fleet.. And based on spottings by various people, 854 also seems to be having quite a number of DDs the past few days, at least 10 A95s spotted on Thursday</p>
              <p>A22 vs OC, does it matter? Both are WAB buses the average commuter will not bother. Besides OC has a higher passenger capacity, so shouldnt OC be preferred over A22 actually for a service like 854?</p>
