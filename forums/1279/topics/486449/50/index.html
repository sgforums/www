              <p>Note that PC5554E (former PA6418U) has been replaced by a newer
              Chinese bus made in 2014.</p>
              <p>Of this list only 4 buses (PA6423D, PA6029J, PC1000M, PC5000L)
              remain in service, though out of these 4, only 6029 has its COE
              extended to 2021, the rest will have their COE expire at the end of
              this month and there is no way to tell whether they will be
              extended or not. I think it is quite fair to statistically
              extrapolate it to the actual number of buses, as these are random

              <p>They will only mess it up if they use the wrong buses on wrong type of routes. Though, the impact will be minimal with bendy buses being used instead of DDs (not the other way) as they will be gone from bus stops in double quick time. Just need longer lots at interchanges.</p>

              <p>If charter rates are as high as Australian rates, then maybe that would help with the maintenance, furthermore those buses would already have to pass ADRs before being allowed to be registered. So yes they are cheaper than Australian bodied ones, but they are still more expensive than the Chinese buses here.</p>
              <p>Most of the Chinese buses here use Cummins. I don't think there are any Weichai or Yuchai engined ones registered yet but I am hearing that a distributor is bringing in one of those on a Higer Midibus. However, the Cummins engine used on China made minibuses, the ISF, is made in China by Foton Cummins.</p>

              <p>The ADL will take longer than the MAN concept bus to unload, as the rear stair coverage area (ie which pax at which seat will use which stairs) is poorer than the MAN concept as it is all the way to the rear. The ADL may clear lower deck pax faster, but whats the point when its the upper deck pax slowing down the unloading (ie upper deck flow is the critical flow, not lower deck). The MAN rear stair is nearer to the middle which means more pax will notice the stairs there and will use it due to it being closer.</p>
              <p>That said, a commercially available product called the bendy bus is already here for decades to solve such issues. Easier to just buy and use a bendy.</p>

              <p>The ADL will take longer than the MAN concept bus to unload, as
              the rear stair coverage area (ie which pax at which seat will use
              which stairs) is poorer than the MAN concept as it is all the way
              to the rear. The ADL may clear lower deck pax faster, but whats the
              point when its the upper deck pax slowing down the unloading (ie
              upper deck flow is the critical flow, not lower deck). The MAN rear
              stair is nearer to the middle which means more pax will notice the
              stairs there and will use it due to it being closer.</p>
              <p>That said, a commercially available product called the bendy bus

              last stair alighting, pax can choose to go to lower deck or exit. forthe last door, a slighlty larger single door can alrdy sinc doubke take more space. alighting, can merge pax alighting from lower deck and upper deck to one single door.
              
              for the starting of course some will try to alight from front stair, but after a while thry will kno to wlight from back stair...

              bendy
              for the rear, got quite a bit of space, usually when i spot. only maybe 20% get to see a fully squeesy one.

              <p>The Bustech has a lot of tyre wear and tear at the front, the only reason why there is a twin steer is to circumvent the weird axle limits in Australia, which allowed it to be the only new double decker in Australia until recently, when the A95 got approved. I suspect because the A95 is light enough to meet the existing Australian axle limits.</p>
              <p>Whereas, the bendy buses, especially the A24, has proven to be as good as 12m single deckers at turning, otherwise they wouldn't be deployed on 858. The Citaro G and O.405Gs however, have a longer front section, which makes it a bit more difficult to turn in the same circumstances. Not sure about other brands.</p>

              <p>That is the ideal situation, which will never happen in real life, people will still alight from the front stairs. Furthermore, asking passengers from the front of the upper deck to use the rear stairs of the ADL makes unloading even longer, as the passenger will need to walk the whole length of the bus (bearing in mind the bus is longer) to reach the stairs. It will be worse than the current 12m DDs at time taken to clear the load.</p>

              <p>At busy stops, it typically takes at least 2 mins for a packed DD to just unload passengers. Thats the same amount of time taken for a bendy to load and unload their pax, actually, bendy buses sometimes does it faster at as fast as 1 min 20 secs. This is just assuming normal unloading and loading at busy stops.</p>
              <p>Full load unloading and loading (ie fresh load of passengers) eg at Clementi MRT/NP/SIM, DDs can take more than 5 mins, partly because they sit at the bus stop for so long that more pax stream in to try and (often unsuccessfully) board the bus. In those situations, 2 to 3 mins for a bendy bus max.</p>
              <p>This is also a reason why most BRTs around the world opt for bendy or even bi-articulated buses, they are an efficient people mover that is the bus product closest to a metro train in terms of efficiency.</p>

              <p>this does not mean that there are issue with the buses... there is the LTA ETS scheme as well which allow CAT C vehicles to deregister early to replace with new Euro 5 vehicles with rebate in COE....the take up rate is very high and maybe these buses are under the ETS...</p>
              <p>further, with rising COE price (as compare to the cheaper China buses price), it will be better for the bus operators to get new MIC buses instead of renewing COE (esp with rising road tax and insurance cost for older buses).</p>

              <p>At busy stops, it typically takes at least 2 mins for a packed
              DD to just unload passengers. Thats the same amount of time taken
              for a bendy to load and unload their pax, actually, bendy buses
              sometimes does it faster at as fast as 1 min 20 secs. This is just
              assuming normal unloading and loading at busy stops.</p>
              <p>Full load unloading and loading (ie fresh load of passengers) eg
              at Clementi MRT/NP/SIM, DDs can take more than 5 mins, partly
              because they sit at the bus stop for so long that more pax stream
              in to try and (often unsuccessfully) board the bus. In those
              situations, 2 to 3 mins for a bendy bus max.</p>
              <p>This is also a reason why most BRTs around the world opt for
              bendy or even bi-articulated buses, they are an efficient people
              mover that is the bus product closest to a metro train in terms of
              efficiency.</p>

              And then 184 bendy came in and just clear boarding n alighting in 2 mins

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">Based
              on the absolute space taken, the DDs win, but a stationary bus is a

              realise more pax can be cleared with a bendy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">Based
              on observations, bendies take less than half the time of DDs
              dwelling at busy bus stops, having similar and significant boarding
              and alighting activities. Using simple, easy to calculate numbers,
              the calculation is as follows:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">In a
              given 6 minutes time frame, and 36 m space. As you have said 3 DDs
              OR 2 bendies can fit into the space. But lets simply assume a bendy
              takes half the time (in fact, in reality, more often than not it
              takes less than half) of a DD. And for simplicity sake, lets assume
              a double deck takes 3 mins (at stops like NP and SIM, 5 mins is not
              unheard of), and a bendy takes 1.5 mins. Ie each DD space can be
              used by 2 DDs in 6 mins and each bendy space can be used by 4
              bendies in 6 mins.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">You
              could fit 3 DDs x 2 buses per space OR 2 bendies x 4 buses per
              space.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">So in
              a given 6 minutes time frame, you could fit 6 DDs OR 8 bendies.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">The
              above calculation was deliberately made simple, but it can be
              extrapolated to fit different dwelling times.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">The above assumes a DD
              takes just 3 mins while a bendy takes 2 mins. In reality, DDs can
              take 5 mins or more to complete boarding and alighting (see 74, 154
              at NP/SIM or Clementi MRT). And also note that typically, a bendy
              can take in a few more people than a DD in terms of total
              capacity.</span></p>
              <p>How about DDs where people don't move upstairs? Like DDs on 222,
              291, 983 where it takes some effort for the drivers to get them
              upstairs, or in the case of 291, the DD is delayed such that the
              next bus (usually a Scania) is at waiting behind to enter the
              berth. Do you know that before the introduction of 983, there
              wasn't a need to place any staff at CCK Ave 5 (the former 300
              u-turn part) to force people to move to the rear of the 300 bendy
              but a few days after 983's DDs were introduced, during the morning
              peak, staff have to be deployed to force people to go upstairs?
              Waste of resources as the staff could be used for other things like

              <p>last time already ask u how many bus stops will have such significant boarding/alighting activities but u cant answer.</p>
              <p>you have mention SIM/NP/Clementi Mrt bus stops.. what about other bus stops whereby the whole bus load of paxes will alight and another whole bus load will board? cant find much also, except for some MRT station bus stops (but mostly it is either alighting or boarding, seldom will have whole bus load alighting then another bus load board)</p>
              <p>For clementi mrt bus stops, not all bus services have significant boarding /alighting activities also, (maybe 154 some trips/some timing, 184 some trips/some timing)... pls do not tell me that every single trips of 184 bendy will have 100 paxes alighing at the bus stop...</p>
              <p>for NP/Sim, if during am peak, mostly will be alighting only. while for afternoon trips, mostly will be boarding (alighting still have, but not the entire bus load).. so basically, the dwelling time should be the same for alighting during AM (or lesser for DDs).. (assuming  u have 3 DDs unloading 300 ppl together compare with 2 bendies unloading 200), or if compare boarding activities during PM, 3 DDs will have less dwell time for boarding compare to 2 Bendies...</p>
              <p>we still haven compare those bus stops for which 2 DDs can do boarding/alighting, but only one bendy can do boarding/alighting.. (esp for boarding situation only). 2 DDs can board together (assume no alighting) and carry 200 paxes in 3 mins? while one bendy can only carry 100paxes in 3 mins (since only one door for boarding)..</p>
              <p>in your example above, you have assume that DDs have double alighting time as compare to Bendies... but in reality, is it really double the time whereby paxes can also alight using front entrance (so 2 exit for DD compare to 3 exit for bendies).</p>
              <p>Bendies have its own usefulness, but in Singapore, space is an issue..<br>to park 300 bendies in a depot, need 50% more space than to park 300 DDs...same go for interchange... </p>
              <p>LTA should throw some DDs on those intratown/SMRT feeders to see whether paxes will go upper deck or not since SMRT is now using their MAN A24 on long haul route instead of feeder/intratown... </p>

              <p>More people do indeed go to the back of a bendy bus than to the
              upper deck of a double deck, especially for shorter journeys. It is
              also easier to get drivers to ask passengers move to the rear on
              bendy buses than to the upper deck of a double deck. That is the
              general observation, you don't believe then go and make another
              observation.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">Common sense
              will also tell you that people will prefer to move in on a bendy
              where they don't have to climb any stairs than a double deck where
              they have to climb a narrow set of stairs. Also because of this set
              of stairs on the DD, things get slowed down, even with a second set
              of stairs and 3rd set of doors on the DD, it will still be slower
              than a bendy as the stairs are narrow such that people can only
              form one file to leave the upper deck, plus the fact that people
              have to watch their steps when going down stairs, its all slower
              than on a bendy, where people just walk direct to the door to
              exit.</span></p>
              <p>The reason why the bus transport hasn't improved significantly
              despite pumping so many buses is because there are too many double
              decks around, and alot of them are doing roles that are not suited
              for them. Bendy buses will speed up things and improve reliability
              and both passenger and traffic flows around busy bus stops.
              Singapore is just too dense a city for us to have double deckers
              choking up the roads. The general consensus around the world
              supports my view that bendy buses are more efficient people movers
              than double deckers.</p>

              <p>* Drifting from bendy/DD topic to SD/DD topic *</p>
              <p>A crowded SD often gets more delayed than a DD bus. Observe this very frequently on SBS feeders/intratowns that have mix of both.</p>
              <p>Reason is simple:</p>
              <p>If SD has around 70 pax on it and packed to door, people will find it very difficult to find their way to exit. Also until people alight and BC asks people to move in, people cannot board.</p>
              <p>This is different when a DD say is carrying 90 pax. People can easily alight while others can board from front door.</p>
              <p>For trunk services, this gets even worse due to distance. Hence, we always complain that how DD follow SD. It is because the SD slowed down drastically during peak hours loading/unloading and then the DD behind catches up.</p>

              <p>I absolutely disagree. DDs on 222 and 291 have a lot of people on upper deck. In fact, 222 DDs from Chai Chee are almost full upper deck. Same for 291 DDs during peak hours. Those taking bus at st 32/33 or st 8183 end up going upper deck. </p>
              <p>For that matter, look at one of shortest routes 225G and 225W. They have pax going upper deck. I had posted upper deck full pics of both the services as well. It is just a mindset change in SMRT area, which slowly will improve. </p>
              <p>Also, why do you think 13A has DDs deployed even though it is only 2-3 stops from Bishan St 22 to Bishan MRT. It is because people go upper deck and 13A DDs can take in 80-90 pax easily during peak hours. </p>
