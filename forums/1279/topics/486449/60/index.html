              <p>There is no reason for 70 to be cut as it has two terminal end points Shenton Way and YCK. 76 was cut because of its long looping point. It could have still terminated at Eunos but via Still Road instead of launching stupid 150 and 134 to make up for it. </p>

              <p>76 is still okay in my opinion.LTA should built a new roadside Siglap terminal for 76,135 &amp; 155.36,62 &amp; 518 is the one need a T2 terminal.LTA very funny leh,Shorter runtime but more rest time,Longer runtime but less break time.518 got only 9-16 mins rest time at PSR after the added runtime..What do they expect?In UK for a 12km bus service,drivers are given an average of 13-22 mins break!No wonder BCs resignation is still high.</p>

              <p>Routes 17 and 73 were facing a very similar scenario (Station A looping at Station B). When it came to contract allocation, they faced opposing fates. Route 17, being in PSR route group, went under Loyang, which is rather understandable. Route 73, being in AMK route group, went to Bishan instead of Seletar. Will we be seeing it originate from TPY?</p>
              <p>Also, Clementi contract includes 174, which passes nowhere near the suburb. The way in which the remaining contracts were split between the incumbents also left Routes 61 and 117 as orphan routes.</p>

              <p>LTA should build a Sengkang bus depot for services in Sengkang and Punggol.</p>
              <p>Take over all Sengkang services (including 965, which will be converted to bi directional), and Punggol services (excluding 3, 118, 136).</p>
              <p>117 will go to Sembawang package, 136 to Seletar, 3 and 118 remain in Loyang.</p>

              <p>The objective is not to have all service under 1 company in the Interchange..That's why LTA purposely didn't want GA to take 117..Only 50 left with SBST..Anyway i think Punggol is just temporary..Who knows what will happen once Tampines North,Woodleigh,Buangkok,Tengah and Marina South ITHs ready.</p>

              <p>Is not because no one ones to talk about man DD is because all the man dd are in Singapore and working . However when the next batch of man DD - coming Jan 2017 the forum will rise again and start to talk about the man DD and which operator will get it and etc . </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From what I have observed for the last few weeks , as I commute to and fro work at yishun - I need to take 854 . I observed that 854 will get up to 6 MAN A95 + 1 Enviro for weekdays while on weekends the no. Comes down to just 3 A95 . This looks good for 854 but they still have at least 10 bendy in the fleet . Like half is WAB the other half is non-WAB . </p>

              <p>Good News ! The next Batch of MAN A95 is here already but is unregistered . Saw it inside ST Kinetic HQ @ Boon Lay . There are a total of 5 Units I saw today (20-11-2016) . There is actually nothing major about 2 of the units but the remaining 3 Units has something new not found on any A95 . And yes I wonder around STK for 3 Hours to confirm the buses inside it if u ask . </p>
              <p>MAN A95 - 2 Units are lush green normal body work by Gemilang . </p>
              <p>MAN A95 - 3 Units are in lush green BUT with seats with headrest ( same as SG5999Z ) and the body work is the same as the MAN DD L ( SG 5999 Z ) with the same BIG-ASS Light ) BUT is not 12.8M . It is still 12 metre Long . USB-charging port is also inside . NO weird 3 door concept . </p>
              <p>To sum up 3 out of the 5 Units @ STK are based on the MAN A95 DD L 12.8m (SG 5999 Z) but is just 12 Metres long with Headrest seats . BTW the seats are the same as the one found in SG 5999 Z . The remaining 2 Units are normal A95 in lush green . </p>
