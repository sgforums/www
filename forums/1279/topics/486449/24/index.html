              <p>IMHO, the A95 construction feels a lot stronger and sturdier than the Enviros. The materials used on the Enviros look cheap, some of the plastic parts on the Enviros feels like plastics used in toys, soft and flimsy, and then there is the creaking noise from the body flexing, certainly the design and/or constuction of the Enviro body has been optimised for cost instead of quality, which is quite disappointing from Alexander Dennis as they used to produce good quality products. You certainly wouldn't want your car to have that kind of noise over bumps as it usually means something wasn't tightened when it should be.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The MAN with Gemilang body may not be as refined as a Wright, but it is certainly miles ahead in terms of quality when compared to the Enviros. The only drawbacks I can find with the MAN is the workmanship on interior fittings, which can be improved. Still better than the Enviros which sound like they have poorly constructed body frames, which is a crucial element when it comes to safety.</span></p>

              <p>860 will get DDs once it is tendered out to other operators. Now the priority is to get more high demand trunk services to get DDs, and SMRT is still short of DDs.</p>

              <p>I certainly wouldn't say creaking is fine. ADL may look nice both inside and outside, but what you can't see (ie parts concealed by interior fittings) is producing those worrying noises, I doubt the body will last without regular inspection and fastening of bolts and joints, and I also doubt its something that can be solved by improving workmanship, but rather its in the design of the body frame. The fact that ADL chose to produce chassis in Malaysia and bodying them in China speaks of how much they want to optimise costs.</p>
              <p>The bodies by Wright and Gemilang (specifically recent ones) have less of these issues, and credits to them for upholding (for Wright) and improving (for Gemilang) on their quality of products. Gemilang may have a cheaper look, but it feels a lot safer to ride in than an Enviro 500.</p>

              <p>One of your "good" quality Enviro 500s taken when it was a month old. Seems that your comment on things not being fitted properly is applicable here.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WHpTzKR.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="4128"></p>
              <p>I think you have to realise asthetics is a separate issue to the structural issues that concern the buses. An Enviro may look nicer than a Gemilang, but the E500 body structure just doesn't seem as strong as even a China bus. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Even China buses don't produce that kind of creaks. The bus just doesn't feel as safe as it should be for passengers.</span></p>
              <p>Well, the Enviros are still new, we will see what kind of condition they will be in when they are the age of the PSV (CDGE) B9TLs. And The PSV B9TLs don't have that kind of creaks from the body, its a strong body just that it has a vibration issue. </p>
              <p>I doubt the Enviro 500 body will last, structually that is, regardless of who is assembling it. And have you seen the quality of the roof sheeting from above, its atrocious, never seen a new bus with such wavy roof before. You want to know why Gemilang and Wright doesn't have this? Because Wright and GML don't roll the roof sheeting onto the roof structure, the technology used by Wright and GML are similar (if I'm not wrong, the Alusussie technology), and involves properly and precisely (ie machine) bending the metal to its required shape, instead of just rolling a sheet of metal and affix it (most likely with SikaFlex) to the roof structure.</p>
