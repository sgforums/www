              <p>167 and 980 don't need DDs, just because they go to the city doesn't mean they have high loadings all the time that justifies a full DD shift. This is the reason why bendies are only deployed on 980 on Sundays.</p>

              They do have high loadings during peak hour, I just told someone that i have to stand all the way from Orchard to Sembawang and 167 was full to the door everytime during peak hour. At Upp Thomson Rd, pax alight, pax board still full to the door.

              <p>But how many trips during peak, and are you able to get enough loading for the rest of the trips to justify DDs? No, because outside peak, it is relatively empty. What 167 and 980 needs is firstly, a staggered arrival timing (they come together, always) and secondly, higher frequencies using single deckers, it will be more beneficial to passengers this way as they will have a shorter waiting time AND more seats. Putting DDs will only give you the latter, not the former.</p>

              2 trip enough already what. 4pm-8pm split shift. I never say it is for off peak, i also got a seat after peak hour on 167/980. 
              
              The main is peak hours. I tell u the commuters are long distance travellers who take this bus all the way to yishun or sembawang and i believe u know that some areas can be congested for 980/167 route so a DD wont kill

              <p>The first significant amount of passengers will alight at Tagore, then along Upper Thomson, a change of passengers occur, (ie some Sembawang/Yishun pax alight while Sin Ming passengers board), then from Thomson medical centre, it is largely alightings.</p>
              <p>In the opposite direction, it is typically seated with reasonable standing pax until Nee Soon camp where it empties out, and remains empty all the way to Sembawang. And because 167 and 980 comes together, this means if 980 gets the pax, 167 will be empty from the city all the way to Sembawang.</p>
              <p>167 and 980 just needs better frequencies instead of DDs, really, as it can be quite hard to wait only to have both 167 and 980 come together.</p>

              <p>But how many trips during peak, and are you able to get enough
              loading for the rest of the trips to justify DDs? No, because
              outside peak, it is relatively empty. What 167 and 980 needs is
              firstly, a staggered arrival timing (they come together, always)
              and secondly, higher frequencies using single deckers, it will be
              more beneficial to passengers this way as they will have a shorter
              waiting time AND more seats. Putting DDs will only give you the
              latter, not the former.</p>

              <p>But in the same vein, you can actually see a lot of empty DD's on 190, 972 and 960 during off peak also. They dont actually need DD's in the town-going direction after AM peak especially after the opening of DTL in Bt Panjang. At 6pm at the junction of Steven Road and Bt Timah Rd, town-going DD's on 190, 700, 960 and 972 are all practically seen to be empty.</p>

              <p>I believe the planners at LTA have the loading numbers to justify why DDs are on certain services and why they aren't on others. If the numbers had been convincing enough, they would had put DDs since 1st Sep.</p>

              <p>I see your logic. But 190 and 972 are becoming more and more empty especially during off peak hour and in the opposite direction even during peak hour.

              <p>Thats an operational issue though. And that is for feeder services with high scheduled frequencies, they are different from the issues 167 and 980 faces, which runs at lower frequencies. Wouldn't it be better for pax to wait for a shorter period than the scheduled 16-17 min freq during PM peak for 980 as an example?</p>
