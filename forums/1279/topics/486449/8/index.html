              <p>Gearbox shouldn't matter. If a driver is careless, then no matter what bus you give the driver, he will still drive the same way. Similarly, if a driver is careful, there should be no reason why he should get into an accident where the fault lies with him.</p>
              <p>More importantly, the bus must be comfortable to drive and have a well designed body that minimises blind spots.</p>
              <p>The danger of choosing a bus with slower accleration will be that drivers may not be able to catch up to their schedules as fast as a bus with faster accleration.

              <p>agreed! </p>
              <p>To add on, I believe that TIB999B raised a salient question on control: whether an A95 with an Ecolife is indeed less controllable than one with a DIWA.<br><br>Short Answer: Yes <br>Long Answer: By virtue of transmission design, the ZF Ecolife transmission can allow for quicker acceleration than a Voith DIWA. Without going into the specifics, ride experience generally suggests that quicker acceleration is often associated with reduced control (for the majority of drivers), and that changing to a Voith <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> reduce the initial acceleration, thereby affording some increased degree of control. </p>
              <p>Remarks: To change transmissions for 'more control' is imo justifiable, although banal and reeks of silliness. Many issues surrounding the ZF A22s can be mitigated with better driver training and mentoring (with suitable technology and personnel of course), although that might be lacking somehow. I feel that the ZF A22s are actually ideally configured, although <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alot</span> of driver training and driver discipline is needed to reap the benefits the driveline affords.  </p>

              <p>One must remember that SMB5888H is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demonstrator</span> and by no means a production unit. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">While it can be argued that MAN/STK know SMRT's requirements well enough (Denso HVAC, Vogel 750 seats, Masats doors, Alcoa Durabright rims etc...), there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no legal or commercial obligation</span> for them to configure 5888H the same way any production units would be expected to be configured.  </span></p>
              <p>On another note though, the Ster seats are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lighter</span> than the Vogel 750s often mentioned <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> Shouldn't their use on a demonstrator (and possibly future production units) be a good thing? </p>

              <p>I can't agree with anyone who believes that a bus with a Voith gearbox will necessarily be easier to 'control' than one with a ZF gearbox.</p>
              <p>It is all down to driving technique and the way that the gearbox is configured (e.g. gearshift profiles).  A ZF-EcoLife gearbox has the potential to make a bus extremely slow (in the lowest-performance 'economy' setting) but yet has the potential to make a bus extremely quick (in a 'power' setting).  The same applies to a bus fitted with a Voith gearbox.</p>
              <p>In fact, each gearbox has the potential to produce rough gear shifting given the right conditions and each has its own unique characteristics and idiosynchrasies.  For example, the ZF gearbox has a primary retarder (on the input side of the gearbox) that relies heavily on engine rpm for maximum effectiveness.  While this makes for a more gradual and smoother retarder application, the retarder is rather ineffective at lower engine speeds.  The Voith gearbox has a secondary retarder (on the output side of the gearbox) that while is effective at all engine speeds, can make for a rather rough actuation with noticeable 'grab', especially when the gearbox has aged.</p>

              <p>If you got the money and the space to park it I wouldn't say that it isn't possible to buy one. You can even configure how you want the interior to be.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't mind back facing seats if it can maximize seating capacity. But I think leg space for the back facing seats for Enviro is kinda limited, on the Citaros and A22s they are okay.</p>
              <p>And yes I would prefer the newer buses to have Ster seats instead, even though they are more thinner, they are wider and more ergonomical. The Volgelsitze System 750 design is getting a little outdated already, in the European markets they have already replaced it with the Pino.</p>

              <p>LOL..it's a trial anyway..</p>
              <p>And currently..most ppl seems to stay at the lower deck more often than going up. Just witnessed svc8 loading for the past week..80% will stay at lower deck(even if no seats) rather than going up..</p>
