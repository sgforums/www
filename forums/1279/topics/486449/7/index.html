              <p>It says that ZF is quieter... But I believe ZF has more advantages than Voith.</p>

              <p>interesting to hear that, was expecting you to mention the
              Ecolife over the DIWA. </p>
              <p>that mentioned, is the D20's lack of low-end torque an issue
              when it comes to drivability? based off observations, the local
              A22s dont seem to suffer that issue whilst the A24 demonstrator and
              to some extent the A95 show it. </p>
              <p>also, would you propose a 6.2:1 rear axle ratio for future
              A95s? </p>

              <p>Out of all the products, the MAN D20 engine is by far the best match for the Voith gearbosx that I have come across.  Impeccably smooth changes up and down and great power delivery.</p>
              <p>The D20 engine, which not having the same % of peak torque below 1000rpm as the Mercedes-Benz OM 457 or OM 470, is definitely no slouch.  The slow initial takeaway that you are experiencing is a product of the gearbox electronically limiting the starting torque to improve ride quality and to reduce fuel consumption and output emissions.  All modern gearboxes apply significant torque restriction in the lower gears, especially considering the peak torque output of today's engines.</p>

              <p>thanks for the clarifications. </p>
              <p>onto transmissions and torque limitation, i understand that MAN and possibly Evobus have torque limiting features in their citybuses (ASR for MAN iirc) that prevent wheel skidding and hence ensure safety. however, this torque limiting aside, can I assume that a 360ps/1800Nm engine mated to a gearbox with 1600Nm max input torque will only have 1600Nm of effective torque (assuming no torque restriction by the gearbox is in place)?    </p>

              <p>Stability control is not the only reason why torque is restricted in lower gears.  Even the heaviest city bus under the most strenuous conditions would never require the full services of an engine with 1800 Nm of peak torque.  The Voith D864.5 can take an input torque of up to 1700 Nm but there's a good chance that the usable torque is 'capped' at a set value (e.g. up to 1500 Nm).  The use of an engine in a higher state of tune would allow an even larger 'window' where actual peak torque is available.  Because modern buses have systems communicating via CAN bus, it is possible for the gearbox, whose job it is to send power to the driving axle(s), to send a signal to the main 'brain' of the bus requesting limited torque.  This is achieved either via electronic wastegate (to limit exhaust gases flowing through the turbocharger(s)) or via control of fuel injection.</p>

              <p>There's absolutely no problems with using a gearbox that has a higher torque input maximum.  If anything, the gearbox will last longer this way as it is put under less stress than it was intended for.</p>

              available.  Because modern buses have systems communicating
              via CAN bus, it is possible for the gearbox, whose job it is to
              send power to the driving axle(s), to send a signal to the main
              'brain' of the bus requesting limited torque.  This is
              achieved either via electronic wastegate (to limit exhaust gases
              flowing through the turbocharger(s)) or via control of fuel
              injection.</p>

              <p>What's with bus manufacturers preferring Voith's 4-speed over the 5-speed? Voith's website says it produces 5-speed transmissions too. The Transperth B7Rs and the SBS WEGs use the 4-speed, but I think the 5-speed may be better. In fact, I would like them mated with the KUB engine.</p>

              <p>to answer the OP, the Voith DIWA Concept merges the torque converter with the retarder into a single unit, hence DIWA (DI -&gt; Differential, that is torque converter; WA -&gt; Wandler, that is retarder). simply put, the Voith torque converter functions BOTH as a torque converter and retarder under startoff and braking respectively, and this design philosophy/implementation underpins the vast difference in acceleration and braking characteristics between the ZF and Voith transmissions.</p>
              <p>could PoweredByCNG explicitly justify the above claim with the specific gear ratios?</p>

              <p>Looks I'm not the only one who prefers the Enviros over the MAN A95... The MAN A22s are easily cui and have spoilt parts, probably why I am not interested in the MAN A95. I find the Enviro is actually very comfy to take, while the MAN A22 is jerky... Another reason I think the MAN A95 is not as comfy.</p>
