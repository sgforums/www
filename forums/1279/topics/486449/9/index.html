              <p>Yah, and the suspensions are very special compared to A22 &amp; A24. Feels like a bouncier Citaro DD, goes smoothly over humps like a Citaro.

              <p>If you want the "bump", travel back in time to year 2007. Take SMRT bus 187 towards Boon Lay Temporary Bus Interchange. For the best experience, take a bendy bus. Sit at the very last row. When the bus is at Jurong West Street 64 about to arrive at the bus interchange, there is this hump on the road. When the bus goes over the hump, the entire bus will "bump". You will love it. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>If you want the "vibration", take any TIBS-era bus. my personal preference is the Scania L113CRL... the vibration level is to the max mannn.... <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>If you want oven experience, take the oldest SMRT bus... the Nissan Diesel U31RCN... when the bus is moving, the metal can get really hot... oh wait. the bus no more already. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually there still is a bump on the road along Jurong West St 64 at the entrance towards jurong point carpark. You can feel it on Service 172, 180, 187 bendys on the departing direction especially when the driver speeds over it. Beware your head if you sit last row though.</p>
              <p>If you want oven of the current buses, can try Scania K230UB Euro V like SBS8902X on 199 or O405G MKI like TIB903C on 180. Sometimes really very hot. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I took SMB5888H last month (20 March) and it was quite bad... The suspension was cui and was incredibly bouncy when the BC pressed on the acclerator (he was late). As with the MAN A22s (ZF), the bus was jerky when starting off and braking. The good points for the bus, however, had to be the more powerful aircon and sturdier bodywork...</span></p>
              <p>The Enviro is a good bus, though it feels mainly electric (i.e using a lot of eletronics to control the comfort of the bus and so on). Comfortwise, the bus is relatively smooth, though the pickup can be slow (braking is also sometimes jerky). Aircon is not well ventilated throughout the bus due to the awfully small aircon outlets. My only other issue with the Enviro is the creaky bodywork (more plasticky compared to 'adhesives' on the MANs with Gemilang bodywork). The BCs also need to control the bus well, especially due to the slippery brakes which squeak easily.</p>
              <p>Overall, you might think the MAN A95 wins because of power and bodywork, but I would frankly choose the Enviro anytime.</p>

              <p>You got a point if view there brother,But for BCs they would
              prefer the A95 over E500 anytime..Most probably due to power rating
              and the driving feeling..No hard feeling ya</p>

              <p>not too surprising given the A95's performance and familarity over the E500s. same dashboard, same gearbox, more powerful yet same model of engine, similar handling and braking... lol what more can they ask for? </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I took SMB5888H
              last month (20 March) and it was quite bad... The suspension was
              cui and was incredibly bouncy when the BC pressed on the acclerator
              (he was late). As with the MAN A22s (ZF), the bus was jerky when
              starting off and braking. The good points for the bus, however, had
              to be the more powerful aircon and sturdier bodywork...</span></p>
              <p>The Enviro is a good bus, though it feels mainly electric (i.e
              using a lot of eletronics to control the comfort of the bus and so
              on). Comfortwise, the bus is relatively smooth, though the pickup
              can be slow (braking is also sometimes jerky). Aircon is not well
              ventilated throughout the bus due to the awfully small aircon
              outlets. My only other issue with the Enviro is the creaky bodywork
              (more plasticky compared to 'adhesives' on the MANs with Gemilang
              bodywork). The BCs also need to control the bus well, especially
              due to the slippery brakes which squeak easily.</p>
              <p>Overall, you might think the MAN A95 wins because of power and
              bodywork, but I would frankly choose the Enviro anytime.</p>

              <p>to clarify my earlier post, I am actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in favour of the E500s</span> over the A95. </p>
              <p>while I understand that the E500s have an aluminium body, I am not sure if a steel frame still underlies the aluminium skin of the E500s. based on the assumption the E500s have a steel frame underlying the aluminium body panels, it should be several orders sturdier than the A95's body as the A95's body frame is also made of aluminium. </p>
              <p>similarly, both the E500s and A95s use the same, if not very similar Denso AC systems; hence i am surprised that the A95 has a more 'powerful' AC. assuming both buses use the same AC, then its a matter of fan speed which the BCs have control over. </p>
              <p>both the E500s and A95 are heavily reliant on electronics in all areas, and control of braking is dependent on the BC's level of skill as well as how the EBS (electronic braking system) is tuned on the vehicles.  </p>
              <p>i wouldnt want to comment too heavily on the E500's interior as the interior is specified by the operator. as for bodywork quality, SBS7888K's current condition will give you a good gauge of how the A95 will eventually become. </p>

              <p>Modern bus all disc brakes,All depend on the BCs.Not many BCs

              accelerate thus making the bus jerky..Most Employee bus and Workers

              <p>for many BCs with little experience, transiting from the O405s to OC/A22 generation of vehicles often comes with a culture shock. acceleration is lost due to multiple gear changes at lower speeds (6 speed vs 4 speed), whilst braking is greatly enhanced thanks to all-wheel disc brakes and EBS in the latest generation of buses. </p>
