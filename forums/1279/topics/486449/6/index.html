              <p>There's always more to it than full-load performance curves.  The MAN D08-series uses EGR only to control NOx out emissions.  Aside from the 20Nm peak torque shortfall compared to the SCR-only MB OM 906 (h)LA, due to the lower efficiency of EGR at controlling NOx, the manufacturer needed to carefully consider how the shape of the performance curves would affect emissions on the test cycles.  The final nominal performance curves is the result.</p>
              <p>And on top of all this, the full-load performance curves do not show how the engines behave at partial throttle.  In this case, the freer-breathing Mercedes-Benz engine (due to absence of EGR) would clearly win.</p>

              <p>There are so many variables.  You have the gearbox and its ratios, the driving axle and final drive ratio, weight, aerodynamics of the bodywork, calibration of the engine, turbocharger specification and even driving style that could easily make the difference.  And that's before you even consider things such as ambient temperature and humidity (engines run better on cool, dry days) and the state of consumable items such as air and fuel filters, conditions of the fuel injectors, turbocharger and so on.</p>

              <p>i'll challenge your premise on fuel consumption penalty concerning the D08 and D20 engines. fuel consumption is measured on a g/kWh against rpm scale, which comes with the caveat that the actual consuption is highly dependent on the amount of power output by the engine at the particular rpm. All other factors equal (as unrealistic as it is but for the purpose of this discussion), if a D08 and D20 have the same fuel consumption at say 1500rpm, with the D20 producing 320hp and D08 producing 290hp, wont the D20 still consume more fuel?</p>
              <p> i appreciate your knowledge and passion on these issues, but there has to be reasons why many PTOs are moving to smaller engines despite the benefits offered by bigger engines.</p>

              <p>I would choose the A95 DD over B9TL anytime,2nd choice will be
                  the Enviro 500.The only thing i dont like A22 is their bodywork
                  plus that hybrid copycat lion hair..Im not suprised if Daimler also
                  began to custom made DD to SBST based on the new 10700cc 350hp
                  Citaro engine</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the germans, or evobus specifically, dont do businesses where markets are fragmented and where orders come in on a cyclical basis. the RHD DD market, for most purposes, is fragmented enough to the point that the germans have pretty much stopped doing that business (on that note, A39 production has stopped early this year).</span></p>
              <p>the MAN A95, for most purposes, is nothing short of unsustainable should there be a lack of "sustained persuasion by concerned parties" to the PTO and other companies involved :) it is nothing short of wading into a market with really big names, thinking that small name with a not-as-well-received prior product would get some attention and hopefully elevate to big name status :D on that note as well, similar persuasion makes procurement easier, and novelty wears out much faster too.</p>

              <p>i'll challenge your premise on fuel consumption penalty
              concerning the D08 and D20 engines. fuel consumption is measured on
              a g/kWh against rpm scale, which comes with the caveat that the
              actual consuption is highly dependent on the amount of power output
              by the engine at the particular rpm. All other factors equal (as
              unrealistic as it is but for the purpose of this discussion), if a
              D08 and D20 have the same fuel consumption at say 1500rpm, with the
              D20 producing 320hp and D08 producing 290hp, wont the D20 still
              consume more fuel?</p>
              <p> i appreciate your knowledge and passion on these issues,
              but there has to be reasons why many PTOs are moving to smaller
              engines despite the benefits offered by bigger engines.</p>

              <p>You are assuming that the engines are compared under full load.  In practice, most of a city bus engine's life is spent either at idle or under low load.  Furthermore, simple physics suggests that a certain amount of energy is required to perform a certain amount of work so you cannot assume that a larger displacement engine automatically consumes more fuel than an engine with a smaller displacement.</p>
              <p>The downsizing of engines is due to stringent emissions requirements.  A smaller engine working harder running at full load more of the time will produce lower emissions because exhaust aftertreatment systems are more efficient at higher temperatures.</p>

              <p>1. Well it depends on the % of load you place on the engine, naturally!</p>
              <p>2. Naturally the 936 will not have the same off-the-line performance that the 457 has in spades despite having similar peak power and torque values in base form (299hp and 1200Nm or 1250Nm respectively).  In saying that though, the 936 is a significantly stronger engine than the 906 that it replaces so now there is less of a case to use the larger engine on a standard city bus unless absolutely necessary.  The OM 470 would without a doubt be an amazing performer with the same 'high torque at low engine speeds' characteristics of the old 457 but with even stronger mid-range torque.</p>
              <p>My contacts in Germany are returning excellent consumption figures with Citaros using the 936 at 299 PS with ZF EcoLife gearbox, just above 30L/100km measured at the pump on urban duties which is actually quite a bit better than the figures returned with the 936 at 286 PS and ZF EcoLife gearbox on previous Citaros and with better performance to boot.</p>

              <p>interesting to hear that, was expecting you to mention the Ecolife over the DIWA. </p>
              <p>that mentioned, is the D20's lack of low-end torque an issue when it comes to drivability? based off observations, the local A22s dont seem to suffer that issue whilst the A24 demonstrator and to some extent the A95 show it. </p>
              <p>also, would you propose a 6.2:1 rear axle ratio for future A95s? </p>
