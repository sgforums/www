              <p>More people do indeed go to the back of a bendy bus than to the upper deck of a double deck, especially for shorter journeys. It is also easier to get drivers to ask passengers move to the rear on bendy buses than to the upper deck of a double deck. That is the general observation, you don't believe then go and make another observation.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">Common sense will also tell you that people will prefer to move in on a bendy where they don't have to climb any stairs than a double deck where they have to climb a narrow set of stairs. Also because of this set of stairs on the DD, things get slowed down, even with a second set of stairs and 3rd set of doors on the DD, it will still be slower than a bendy as the stairs are narrow such that people can only form one file to leave the upper deck, plus the fact that people have to watch their steps when going down stairs, its all slower than on a bendy, where people just walk direct to the door to exit.</span></p>
              <p>The reason why the bus transport hasn't improved significantly despite pumping so many buses is because there are too many double decks around, and alot of them are doing roles that are not suited for them. Bendy buses will speed up things and improve reliability and both passenger and traffic flows around busy bus stops. Singapore is just too dense a city for us to have double deckers choking up the roads. The general consensus around the world supports my view that bendy buses are more efficient people movers than double deckers.</p>

              <p>Oddly enough, while some of the A95s have higher OMVs, the last batch registered out of the 60 SG plate ones on the roads now are actually cheaper than the competition.</p>

              <p>More people do indeed go to the back of a bendy bus than to the
                  upper deck of a double deck, especially for shorter journeys. It is
                  also easier to get drivers to ask passengers move to the rear on
                  bendy buses than to the upper deck of a double deck. That is the
                  general observation, you don't believe then go and make another
                  observation.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">Common sense
                  will also tell you that people will prefer to move in on a bendy
                  where they don't have to climb any stairs than a double deck where
                  they have to climb a narrow set of stairs. Also because of this set
                  of stairs on the DD, things get slowed down, even with a second set
                  of stairs and 3rd set of doors on the DD, it will still be slower
                  than a bendy as the stairs are narrow such that people can only
                  form one file to leave the upper deck, plus the fact that people
                  have to watch their steps when going down stairs, its all slower
                  than on a bendy, where people just walk direct to the door to
                  exit.</span></p>
              <p>The reason why the bus transport hasn't improved significantly
                  despite pumping so many buses is because there are too many double
                  decks around, and alot of them are doing roles that are not suited
                  for them. Bendy buses will speed up things and improve reliability
                  and both passenger and traffic flows around busy bus stops.
                  Singapore is just too dense a city for us to have double deckers
                  choking up the roads. The general consensus around the world
                  supports my view that bendy buses are more efficient people movers
                  than double deckers.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>first point, not sure how you think it is easier for BC to ask paxes to move in to the back end of the bendy? by shouting? </p>
              <p>Common sense? how do u explain those bendies which are full in front and empty at the back... </p>
              <p>so DD resulted in public transport not improving? So public transport will improve when all the services are running bendies and all the interchanges have to be expanded to accomodate with the bendies? last time, we already argue on this matter as well...have explained previously that bendies buses does not necessary speed up loading at bus stops, since NOT ALL PAXES alight at one bus stop (only at some major bus stops where there are more alighting)... </p>
              <p>further, 2 bendies buses can alight together, but 3 DDs can board/alight together... so things still the same.. not so sure about the fact that the bendies speed up traffic flow when it is infact taking more road space? </p>
              <p>you yourself admit Singapore is too dense a city and further it is too small, that it cant afford 2000 bendies to be running around the roads of Singapore... no space to park them also... </p>
              <p>this is taken at around 830am at junction of Bishan st22/Bishan Road.</p>
              <p>A sv52 DD travelling towards Bishan Mrt with upper deck fully seated and lower deck full as well...Paxes board along St22 which is quite nearby... so since you say generally short distance dun go upper deck, then how do u explain this? u go can see for yourself from8am to 9am at this junction...</p>

                  <p>Note that PC5554E (former PA6418U) has been replaced by a newer Chinese bus made in 2014.</p>
                  <p>Of this list only 4 buses (PA6423D, PA6029J, PC1000M, PC5000L) remain in service, though out of these 4, only 6029 has its COE extended to 2021, the rest will have their COE expire at the end of this month and there is no way to tell whether they will be extended or not. I think it is quite fair to statistically extrapolate it to the actual number of buses, as these are random spottings that I have made over the past 7 years.</p>

              <p>first point, not sure how you think it is easier for BC to ask
                                      paxes to move in to the back end of the bendy? by
                                      shouting? </p>
              <p>Common sense? how do u explain those bendies which are full in
                                      front and empty at the back... </p>
              <p>so DD resulted in public transport not improving? So public
                                      transport will improve when all the services are running bendies
                                      and all the interchanges have to be expanded to accomodate with the
                                      bendies? last time, we already argue on this matter as well...have
                                      explained previously that bendies buses does not necessary speed up
                                      loading at bus stops, since NOT ALL PAXES alight at one bus stop
                                      (only at some major bus stops where there are more
                                      alighting)... </p>
              <p>further, 2 bendies buses can alight together, but 3 DDs can
                                      board/alight together... so things still the same.. not so sure
                                      about the fact that the bendies speed up traffic flow when it is
                                      infact taking more road space? </p>
              <p>you yourself admit Singapore is too dense a city and further it
                                      is too small, that it cant afford 2000 bendies to be running around
                                      the roads of Singapore... no space to park them also... </p>
              <p>this is taken at around 830am at junction of Bishan st22/Bishan
                                      Road.</p>
              <p>A sv52 DD travelling towards Bishan Mrt with upper deck fully
                                      seated and lower deck full as well...Paxes board along St22 which
                                      is quite nearby... so since you say generally short distance dun go
                                      upper deck, then how do u explain this? u go can see for yourself
                                      from8am to 9am at this junction...</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">2 bendies vs 3 DDs can alight assuming the same space, and this brings us to the following example I have posted before:</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">Based on the absolute space taken, the DDs win, but a stationary bus is a sitting duck. When you take into account of the flow, you will realise more pax can be cleared with a bendy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">Based on observations, bendies take less than half the time of DDs dwelling at busy bus stops, having similar and significant boarding and alighting activities. Using simple, easy to calculate numbers, the calculation is as follows:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">In a given 6 minutes time frame, and 36 m space. As you have said 3 DDs OR 2 bendies can fit into the space. But lets simply assume a bendy takes half the time (in fact, in reality, more often than not it takes less than half) of a DD. And for simplicity sake, lets assume a double deck takes 3 mins (at stops like NP and SIM, 5 mins is not unheard of), and a bendy takes 1.5 mins. Ie each DD space can be used by 2 DDs in 6 mins and each bendy space can be used by 4 bendies in 6 mins.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">You could fit 3 DDs x 2 buses per space OR 2 bendies x 4 buses per space.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">So in a given 6 minutes time frame, you could fit 6 DDs OR 8 bendies.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px; line-height: 16.8032px;">The above calculation was deliberately made simple, but it can be extrapolated to fit different dwelling times.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">The above assumes a DD takes just 3 mins while a bendy takes 2 mins. In reality, DDs can take 5 mins or more to complete boarding and alighting (see 74, 154 at NP/SIM or Clementi MRT). And also note that typically, a bendy can take in a few more people than a DD in terms of total capacity.</span></p>
              <p>How about DDs where people don't move upstairs? Like DDs on 222, 291, 983 where it takes some effort for the drivers to get them upstairs, or in the case of 291, the DD is delayed such that the next bus (usually a Scania) is at waiting behind to enter the berth. Do you know that before the introduction of 983, there wasn't a need to place any staff at CCK Ave 5 (the former 300 u-turn part) to force people to move to the rear of the 300 bendy but a few days after 983's DDs were introduced, during the morning peak, staff have to be deployed to force people to go upstairs? Waste of resources as the staff could be used for other things like controlling buses at the interchange.</p>
              <p>How sure are you that passengers can't hear a bus driver shouting on a bendy when usually you will be able to hear the commotion even when sitting at the last row of a bendy, maybe you don't sit there often so you won't know.</p>

              <p>Let me tell you something - people sometimes wont ever try to move to the back of a bendy because they just want to alight fast. As a bendy only has 1 door at a trailer compared to 2 at the front, they would rather just stand in front of the exit door so that they dont waste time.

              <p>Also, I dont think its fair to compare how fast a bendy can load/unload passengers. While a bendy has 3 doors, a DD only has 2. This is the case of how some bus services are struggling with the MANs given that they have only 2 doors.</p>

              <p>Your first para is what me and lemon1974 have been discussing, which then led to a discussion involving asking passengers to move in or up, so that has been covered in my reply to him.</p>
              <p>Your next paragraph doesn't take into the realities of the current situation. It is absolutely fair to compare a 2 door DD with a 3 door bendy as these are the products available on the market right now as proven products. Saying that it is unfair is like saying that it is unfair for one kid to get 100 for an exam while another getting 40 for the same exam.</p>
              <p>On 3 door bendies vs 3 door DDs. It has to be noted that the 3 door dual staircase DDs will have to be extended to at least 12.8m (in MAN's case) or 13m (in ADL's case). This is to compensate for the loss of seats to the staircases.</p>
              <p>Lets look at the ADL for example, it is a road hog at 13m, while not having any significant increase in seats as compared to a normal DD, which contradicts the double decker supporters claim of "people wanting more seats, so a 3 door dd is going to solve the issues", plus the ADL has a enormous rear overhang which looks like it will sideswipe anything beside it when it turns. Plus, it will still take longer for passengers to get from their seats on the upper deck to the doors than someone getting from their seats at the back of a bendy bus to the doors as climbing stairs requires more caution than walking on a relatively flat surface (common sense).</p>
              <p>As for rear door boarding, it has to be noted that it is practiced at certain interchanges such as CCK and Woodlands during peak periods. Compare a bendy with just 2 foor boarding to a rear door boarding of a DD, the bendy is much faster, not just because some people will choose to stay below hence causing a clash of flows, but also because whoever who chose to go upstairs take a longer time to climb the stairs.</p>

              <p>So...why is SBST still buying DDs over the years despite having trials with the bendies? Also, over the years, improvements have been made for the DDs such as straight staircases which would have otherwise been the case for you, in which you said that flat surfaces require less caution than flat staircases which take a longer time</p>
              <p>Lets also try to look at some full-DD services such as 168. As a regular commuter of 168, not much time is wasted when people from Tampines take the DDs. A person takes the staircase in 5 seconds. If the staircase is full, 5 pax would otherwise be able to fill it and reach the upper deck in 5 secs. Also, it seems that there is no problem with the DDs as buses often come on time and almost always fill a bus load of passengers despite needing some time to load the passengers</p>
              <p>Actually, it depends on the passenger patterns. There are some times when passengers would not want to go up while others would. For example, previously, 856 used to be full of DDs but almost no worker goes up. However, with bendies, from what I seen, people move to the back and less passengers are left out. However, 981 is always full even upstairs. I am not sure why because I am not a 981 commuter but as I say it depends on passenger patterns</p>

                      trials with the bendies? Also, over the years, improvements have
                      been made for the DDs such as straight staircases which would have
                      otherwise been the case for you, in which you said that flat
                      surfaces require less caution than flat staircases which take a
                      longer time</p>
              <p>Lets also try to look at some full-DD services such as 168. As a
                      regular commuter of 168, not much time is wasted when people from
                      Tampines take the DDs. A person takes the staircase in 5 seconds.
                      If the staircase is full, 5 pax would otherwise be able to fill it
                      and reach the upper deck in 5 secs. Also, it seems that there is no
                      problem with the DDs as buses often come on time and almost always
                      fill a bus load of passengers despite needing some time to load the
                      passengers</p>
              <p>Actually, it depends on the passenger patterns. There are some
                      times when passengers would not want to go up while others would.
                      For example, previously, 856 used to be full of DDs but almost no
                      worker goes up. However, with bendies, from what I seen, people
                      move to the back and less passengers are left out. However, 981 is
                      always full even upstairs. I am not sure why because I am not a 981
                      commuter but as I say it depends on passenger patterns</p>

              <p>They only had 2 bendies for trial, and that was when bus operators owned and designed their own bus depots and workshop facilities (ie alll infrastructure expenses paid by themselves). Not going into detail but the facilities in the workshops of SBS differs from SMRT's. Only thing I can say is SMRT's workshop is more flexible. Furthermore when it comes to DD purchasing, they have only bought DDs of one particular engine arrangement in large numbers (Transverse engine with angle drive). All these to simplify parts and training. The only exception are the 200 O.305s, which is basically a single deck chassis when you talk about mechanical specs.</p>
              <p>But now, gov owns the infrastructure, it is a good opportunity for the government to move away from double deckers and go for bendy buses so that a more efficient system can be achieved for better rides.</p>
              <p>As for 168, if you noticed my posts, unlike the double deck purists who say that bendies should be all gone, I have never said that double deckers are unsuitable for all routes, what is needed are suitable buses for different routes. Though 161 and 168 do provide a good example when it comes to bendy vs DD unloading time at Woodlands, but thats besides the point here.</p>
              <p>981's main catchment comes from pax travelling to and from areas not served by 856. If you don't board the bus, or move upstairs, I'm sure someone else, be it drivers or other pax, will make sure you do that, because if you don't someone else will miss the only bus service to those areas and be late for work if they waited for the next one.</p>

              <p>Well I hope they dont make a mess-up situation here given that they occupy space</p>
              <p>Now I know why people want to go up on 52 and those other DD services</p>
