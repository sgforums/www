              <p>I am going to rant about 854 deployment again . 854 on this few
              days have been using more and more SD . What worst is that all
              those spare Enviro 500 ( taken out from 856 / 969 / 857 ) are
              appearing on 854 . While 854 A95 buses are taken away to replace
              those missing Enviro . Hello smrt ! Why do you want to swap buses
              here and there in the 1st place ? 856 / 857 cannot use Enviro 500
              bus is it ? Must use A95 bus huh ? What bullshit crap are you
              thinking ? Swapping buses here and there ? 856 need full fleet A95
              DD meh ? Enviro cannot do the job ah ? 854 last time was mixed
              fleet enviro &amp; A95 but now enviro buses has been on the rise
              and A95 buses decrease.  F*** you smrt for your rubbish
              deployment and only favour those money making routes . ( 854 is
              also a money making route with full capacity on peak hours on
              weekdays ) </p>

              168 only 1 or 2 SD out of the fleet once or twice a week and almost all of them are epull. So 168 is not the right example for this.
              
              Only 161 downgrade fleet on weekends. Around half fleet downgrade to SD n DD give those city svc.

              <p>U miss out 89 that also got massive downsize during weekends as well.</p>
              <p>161 is another service that is a headache during Sundays/PH. Recently, even Sat also had massive downsize. The last thing that I want to see on 161 during weekends is a DM3500 being deployed.</p>
              <p>168 is not much of an issue, there are still majority DDs seen on a regular weekend basis.</p>
