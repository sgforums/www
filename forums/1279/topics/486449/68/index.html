              <p>The MAN A95 is better than the WEG, so does that mean that the

              <p>The A95 has PIS, better doors and higher capacity, but it ends
              there. But at least WEG has capacity only slightly less than A95.
              While the Citaro has capacity MUCH lower than K230UB.</p>
              <p>I agree that the WEG still has room for improvement. But that
              doesn't make it trash.</p>

              <p>Haha ya. I hold to the opinion that the B9 is trash. And it doesnt have to be because the A95 is good (I think it is), its coz I dont even like the WEG in the first place! Sure the chassis isnt all that bad, but that's about it. It has horrible bodywork, horrible transmission, etc. </p>
              <p>Is there a problem with saying its trash? My definition of trash can differ from yours yknow. I just dont think that LTA should be adding orders like crazy, for a make like this!</p>
