              <p>Maybe because they are too common haha. Actually the A22 chassis is a very good chassis, like the A24. For me the reason why I do not really like them is because of the cheaply made Gemilang bodywork combined with SMRT's standard of maintenance. As a result a lot of the older A22s are already showing it's age, such as loud radiators, weird engine sounds, black smoke coming out of the exhaust pipe and bad overall condition of the exterior and interior panels, which many have became loose. Also another point I don't really like about the A22/A24/A95 series is the creaky sound from the rear axle whenever the bus moves off from a start or just before a full stop. It's very irritaing especially on badly maintained MANs.</p>

              <p>I would think its a common but misplaced perception that Gemilangs are cheap and therefore they are not good. I would say it isn't really that true. Yes, the Scanias are quite honestly crap IMO, but those were one of the first mass production citybuses they have supplied, and they were supplied as kits to local assemblers instead of being built in Malaysia. But years have passed between the first Scanias and the MANs, and I think Gemilang has done a pretty good improvement over the years. Moreover, they give their customers a chance to customise their buses, instead of shafing a integral design with very few options.</p>
              <p>The creaks on the MAN A22s are not limited to MAN buses and have been observed in recent O.500LEs in Australia. It is a brake mechanism and is designed to work and sound that way. This is in contrast to the worrying creaks from the body flex on the Enviro 500s, which sound like they have very bad body design and built quality. I actually feel safer on the Wrights and on 5888 due to this.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree that Gemilang have improved a lot over the years, the one on SMB5888H is probably the best so far. The bodywork on the KUBs and the OC500LEs may be less well built as compared to the one on the A22, but if you take a look at those well maintained ones, actually they are still quite good. My point is at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if you have something that is cheap. If you take good care of it, chances are that it will last just as well.</p>
              <p>Oh, so the creaks are from the brake mechanism. I rest my case on that then since it is part of the bus. Actually I find the bodywork of the Enviro 500 being quite fine, but they do need some serious review on their assembly and bodywork building methods, as not even the old Alexander Royale bodyworks creak like that.</p>

              <p>Yeah, remarkable acceleration. Especially when the BC decides to start flooring from the bus stop just to beat the amber light at the junction a few metres ahead. The 0-40kmh timing uh..fastest among the other types of buses currently running now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"><br>(the Citaros used to be quite near, but then SBST &amp; SMRT limited back the acceleration somewhat)<br><br>Wouldn't be too far off to say that the A22s helped alot of the SMRT drivers &amp; the services to stick to their frequencies better..</p>
