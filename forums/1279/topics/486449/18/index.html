              <p>Yeah. I personally feel that too. I guess 851 will be getting more MAN A95s in the future, as well as some for 854 and 857. I am not sure whether 855 or 860 will get any DDs. Btw KJDEP and WPDEP have many DDs already, around 50 to 60+. Also since AMDEP never take in MAN A24s recently, I personally guess it will take MAN A95s soon. Now its WLDEP/WPDEP turn to take MAN A24s hahaha, as well as KJDEP.</p>

              <p>Very much possible.</p>
              <p>Many svcs went WAB without much high capacity buses. There are also svcs which need O405Gs to add capacity. These are 169, 804, 811, 851, 901, 911, 965 and 969.</p>

              <p>230 A22 for SMRT have been deployed on the roads.balance 102 are for BSEP (of which 21 are on the road).. so guess if some A22 are being converted to A95 order, then it should be for BSEP instead?  </p>

              <p>Yes you are right. Furthermore since 851 does not benefitted from BSEP.</p>

              <p>Well, with SMRT buying so many SDs, this is probably the after effects being felt now. I guess SMRT only sees the need to upgrade when the SD bus becomes so packed till people cant board. For 851, most of the times, the SDs only have 70% of standee space used up. Bendys usually have very few standees during weekday peak hours from AMK to Little India Area. The bendys are quite well-utilised on weekends between AMK and Little India/Bugis sectors.</p>
              <p>Used to take 851 to school as a secondary school student some 12-13 years ago daily. Back then 851 loading was very high and the newly registered bendies were a saviour. But somewhere along the way, 851 seemed to have lost its very high demand and only became moderate demand. And with the service going WAB, alot of bendys were replaced with OCs with an increased frequency. Recently loading has picked up again for people along AMK ave 6 and marymount taking the service to Marymount CCL. But its still not reaching the very high demands of the past.  So IMO, this service needs upgrade, but not in dire need yet.</p>

              <p>851 in need of DDs. I am frequent user rider of 851 and I know

              always standing on the bus when going home. Its been 1.5 year I

              <p>SMRT totally screwed up 851. Given the long distance passengers have to stand, the loading has kind of tipped down between Marymount and Tiong Bahru. It is still pretty high between Marymount and Yishun but has 852 in parallel.</p>
              <p>This way SMRT has killed its own loading on 851 by making people change to other bus services / MRT for travel. I doubt 851 will get DDs anytime soon. They have downgraded so many bendy slots to SDs.. and keep doing that almost every other quarter. Now left with only 6 bendies and so many A22s spammed.</p>

              <p>I agree that 851 loading has dropped... but it is more because people have gotten frustrated with no seats to sit on long distances... and opted for other options instead. People prefer to stand in MRT than on buses when the distance is long.</p>
              <p>Once 851 starts getting more high capacity buses, loading also will improve.</p>
              <p>This is also my theory for 857. The DDs are carrying 80-85+ pax on every peak trip, and upto 100-120 pax between YCK road and Yishun. How the hell did SMRT manage without DDs? They just let people choose other modes of transport. Now that people know there are DDs, they take 857 a more direct way from some parts of city to travel to Yishun.</p>

              <p>I think if 851 is not getting DDs despite feedback there is likelihood that either 5890 or 5891 (or later A95 units) may go 851 if it goes to AMDEP since it is unlikely that it'll get any enviros as there won't by any more pb units registered and 851 has not been touched by BSEP yet. I think that explains why it's taking so long for 851 to get DD upgrade.</p>
