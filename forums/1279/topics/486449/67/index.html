              <p>I did take into account the location but it is a matter of direct service; when TEL1 opens in 2019, there will be three options. Either the students want to get down from Woodlands and head to take 169 and 902 (still have to cover walking distance but spend a few more minutes given the possible queue), or they have to transfer to TEL from Woodlands. There are even students who opted to walk a long distance from WTI to RP. </p>
              <p>Perhaps not many people would directly transfer to TEL initially since TEL1 only covers Woodlands, but when the rest of the TEL opens it would connect Woodlands to other places and they wouldn't have to rely on 169/902 too much.</p>

              <p>To be honest, if LTA and PTOs are not going to support the use of Bendy buses on feeder routes, atleast please don't deploy 2-door double decker buses. Don't need 100% bendy for feeders but atleast 1 in 2 or 1 in 3 will be good because these buses use the space more effectively and they can manage the loading patterns of a feeder like SDs can, plus reduce driver to passenger ratio. If not, just use SD and increase frequency which in turn is less cost effective in some ways because more space, more drivers but more cost effective cos lesser models to manage. There is always a tradeoff. 3 door 12.8m DD could be a solution but we have to see if these 12.8m can negotiate the sharp turns too as feeders Ply narrower roads.</p>
              <p>I will say Bendy bus operations are feasible in Singapore, as long as they are not deployed in the current fashion. We are no country with a lot of road space to have so many bendy on the  roads. If even woodlands interchange reserves those Bendys for 858 and feeders/intra town, the congestion issues will be more under control. Anyway with close to 150 O405Gs being deregistered this yr, I believe SMRT will pull the remaining Bendys to serve feeders. SD and DD shld form the bulk of Singapore fleet with 200-300 bendy at most to plug in gaps with their advantages. And talking about congestion, have you seen Boon Lay... The congestion is partially due to heavy alighting at the interchange from 2 door DD buses. I'm not saying use bendy there but my point is, no bendy doesn't mean no congestion. </p>
              <p>I think those who want to comment, please analyse the situation first and don't anyhow blindly say just put 2-door double deck. Ideally it solves the problem cos LTA see both same capacity and lesser space on the road. The truth is these DDs are doing a "not bad job" at the expense of people inconvenience and time. Bendys may congest the interchange for now but once they are out into those you roads where U have only 1 or 2 service, they are superior and at MRT stations they layover shorter times. And bear in mind, with more stations emerging in heartlands, people are going to travel lesser distances on feeders.. There will be more cases like 912 913 and 302, unless of course the feeder concept is extinct in Singapore. </p>

              and at MRT stations they layover shorter times. And bear in mind,
              with more stations emerging in heartlands, people are going to
              travel lesser distances on feeders.. There will be more cases like
              912 913 and 302, unless of course the feeder concept is extinct in
              Singapore. </p>

              <p>Yeah height restriction routes can also do with bendy but this one I rather say not neccessary. These routes can still cope with increased SD frequency. At 1 point I also used to say 105 can use bendy. But how many units will u need to just sustain that 1 service plus 105 crosses some heavy congested areas.</p>
              <p>But for feeders that go through congestion free small roads and heavy loading, you dont need that many units to sustain that service - definitely feasible.</p>
              <p>Today I took SBS7496H on 88 from AMK station to Buangkok Green during peak hours. If I run that distance, it takes 25-30mins. The bus took 40mins. Why? Cos every busstop had heavy passenger activity in terms of both boarding and alighting. And for a DD, the upper deck people must come down then people can board and go up. So every busstop layover atleast 5 mins. Very slow. My point is not to say 88 needs bendy but I will strongly believe 88 can do better with some DD slots being split to 2SDs instead of 100% DD fleet.</p>
              <p>That being said, this is the scenario that feeders face. You put DD, this is what will happen. Atleast 88 sees this for a certain sector of its route and DD might benefit the bigger picture of TPY to Pasir Ris, so fine. But feeder see this start to end, treating it this way will definitely be a step back in our public transportation.</p>

              <p>Some of your earlier points on bendies were legit. but some of your points such as that on svc 88 is rubbish. It puts the entire credibility of your bendy discussion to stake as you come across anti-DD and bendy-biased (which I believe you are).</p>
              <p>Anyway, my friend, get over it, bendies are gone. Not your or my decision, but the higher authorities there! And I feel sad too, as there should have been bendies for certain feeder/intra-town/height restriction routes.</p>
