              <p>HK ≠ SG, firstly. In HK wrights are assembled in Zhuhai while
              SG, STK (or is it CDGE I forgot). So there, HK wrights aren't the
              most durable either so your point on quality falls.</p>
              <p>Next. Dont generalise the order for HK, there are also a 1000
              over B9s for KMB alone, so just coz 220 of them are cheaper does
              not mean the rest will be. </p>
              <p>Look, I just think that for what LTA is getting they are on the
              shorter end of the stick since they are paying almost the same, if
              not more, for an older model of the make that is the B9. If they do
              want to take Volvo they should just convert the remaining orders
              (if any, good riddance lol) to B8TL directly. I think with E6
              engine it will def be more worth the time. </p>
              <p>Oh and ofc. Pls let it come w Ventura doors ans PIS. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wrong, the current batches of Wrights are not assembled in Zhuhai anymore, but in Malaysia. KMB only has 627 new (2010s) and old (ie mid to old 2000s) B9TLs, if we talk about the newer Euro 5s B9TLs, they only have 473 right now. Singapore has more Wrights and more B9TLs than HK.</p>
              <p>Euro 6 runs at a higher temperature which requires more cooling capabilities and it also comes with a trade off in torque (which is essential for urban operations) vs Euro 5s, and it typically comes at a higher purchasing and maintenance cost. Operators much prefer to operate older emissions standards buses than newer ones for this reason.</p>
              <p>Why would you want Ventura doors when you have a faster, more high tech door that Masats offer.</p>

              <p>IMO I think they shld just sell the storage B9s and buy in A24,
                  deploy them all on feeders.. Replace old bendies, ensuring HC buses
                  that are actually MEANT for feeders, and we can do some spring
                  cleaning of the rubbish here. Win-win-win situation!</p>

              <p>This was the same thing I heard when the first B9TL WEG2 was introduced back in 2010 and the order stood at 150 units.</p>
              <p>To quote Trump: "We’re going to win so much, you’re going to be so sick and tired of winning."</p>
              <p>Anyway after looking at that B8L due for KMB, your complaint is pretty much moot at this point. This should be the last from Volvo for Singapore.</p>

              <p>I did chat regarding Euro VI to a GAS chief technology and he reply the same thing.Euro VI engine need additional cooling system to disperse all heat especially for our tropical climate.He also said that Euro VI is essentially a Euro V with additional upgrade to Euro VI thus the complications,Unless its a totally new engine like the MB O936 7700cc engine</p>

              <p>Wrong, the current batches of Wrights are not assembled in
              Zhuhai anymore, but in Malaysia. KMB only has 627 new (2010s) and
              old (ie mid to old 2000s) B9TLs, if we talk about the newer Euro 5s
              B9TLs, they only have 473 right now. Singapore has more Wrights and

              <p>Euro 6 runs at a higher temperature which requires more cooling

              at a higher purchasing and maintenance cost. Operators much prefer

              <p>These new EURO emissions standards are basically under the conditions of the European markets, which the climate is different from our tropical climate. Thus it takes time to modify the equipment in order to satisfy the standards while ensuring the reliability operating under tropical climates. </p>

              <p>With all due respect. You clearly overestimate the LTA we are talking about here. The reason why I have given up all hope on upgrading specs for B9 and Citaro is coz after SIX YEARS of buying the same shit LTA AND SBST has done NOTHING to change, besides the straight staircase formation, which btw was brought in by SMRT first with the ADL, oh the irony.</p>
              <p>If it is so easy to write to LTA I would've done so alr. Would you like to try then? Anyways LTA will just give one of their answering machine responses, basically wasyomg time and effort. </p>
              <p>Because LTA ppl are STUBBORN, RELUCTANT TO CHANGE and KIASI in their work. They just need their paycheck and that's all. Thats the problem with having excessively high base salaries you see, there is no incentive to break frontiers and progress even further.</p>
              <p>This applies to bendies too. Because they are so ignorant to the fact that bendies can co exist with DDs and it doesnt have to be one over the other, that one can be used for trunks and another for short haul, thats causing regrettable decisions to be made.</p>

              <p>I find it very hard to agree with the statement in red, to say that less bendies = better bus operations is not valid. Just look at the feeder services in Woodlands, replacing bendies with regular 12 m buses means more drivers have to be deployed, and in many cases result in more bus bunching, not less. In fact, my observation with svc 913 is that its reliability has gone down the drain ever since they added A22s into the fleet. So at least, bendy buses should be used for the feeder routes ...</p>

              <p>The problem also lies with SMRT,Before BCM why don't they expand or lease another place for a bigger depot.They always ask help from LTA citing overcrowding depots,So LTA let them use Bulim and Loyang respectively.They also breached their promise by deploy bendies on long haul trunks.So most probably LTA had enough..Standardise fleet.But again i strongly disagreed if they decided to scrap all bendy buses including the A24.In fact they should have buy another 30 A24 for SMRT and lease to them instead..O405G have to go because its not WAB.</p>
              <p>Seems like SMRT doesn't like the E500.</p>
