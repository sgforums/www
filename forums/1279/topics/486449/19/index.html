              <p>In my opinion 851 doesnt warrant many high capacity buses.Ideal fleet is 15 OC500LE,9 A95/E500 and 3 A22/Citaro.Full day shift cam deploy 6 DDs while 3 will be on split duties.</p>
              <p>854 simply warrant many HC buses,20 A95/E500,7 OC500LE will be nice.</p>
              <p>857 need 14 A95/E500,5 A22/OC500LE/Citaro.</p>
              <p>Any excess DDs can be deployed to svc like 61,67 and 961.</p>

              <p>Well, with SMRT buying so many SDs, this is probably the after
                      effects being felt now. I guess SMRT only sees the need to upgrade
                      when the SD bus becomes so packed till people cant board. For 851,
                      most of the times, the SDs only have 70% of standee space used up.
                      Bendys usually have very few standees during weekday peak hours
                      from AMK to Little India Area. The bendys are quite well-utilised
                      on weekends between AMK and Little India/Bugis sectors.</p>
              <p>Used to take 851 to school as a secondary school student some
                      12-13 years ago daily. Back then 851 loading was very high and the
                      newly registered bendies were a saviour. But somewhere along the
                      way, 851 seemed to have lost its very high demand and only became
                      moderate demand. And with the service going WAB, alot of bendys
                      were replaced with OCs with an increased frequency. Recently
                      loading has picked up again for people along AMK ave 6 and
                      marymount taking the service to Marymount CCL. But its still not
                      reaching the very high demands of the past.  So IMO, this
                      service needs upgrade, but not in dire need yet.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>even on weekends (sundays) 851 has been downgraded from 5 to 3 bendies, and 1 TQ slot (maybe 1 of the 3 bendy) now crossing to 860... </p>
              <p>851 is still very crowded in the morning at 6:45 onwards and especially at 7+am, with all rigids completely packed and many people needing to wait for the next bus, but SMRT just simply ignored it... all the 851 bendies continue to cross to services like 856, with the first one only coming at 8+am.</p>
              <p>People from marymount thomson etc have switched to SBST's 54 (and im sure some others), which has been upgraded, receiving DDs over the past years</p>
              <p>dk how smrt can neglect it like that... (and also strange why no bsep add yet, whereas svcs like 966 are getting adds excessively)</p>

              <p>As I mentioned 851 has lost its loading to a great extent.</p>
              <p>1. People are frustrated with the poor service levels on 851 and getting no seat</p>
              <p>2. People have moved to other services </p>
              <p>3. Along 851s route there are other alternatives available, unlike 857 and 966... hence, those were a higher priority. </p>

              <p>Wonder if anyone spotted 5889?Wlbp saw about 2-3 new A95s few days ago.</p>
              <p>My guess is that SMRT only ordered 30 units while LTA might probably purchased more than 50 units gradually.But looking at their current spacing at the depots,They might retire early those non WAB buses.Right now only WLBP got few spaces.</p>
              <p>Wldep/Wlbp might take 60% of the units while Kjdep takes about 25% and the balance might goes to Amdep.</p>

              <p>Although 851 has dropped its number of bendys over the years, i must say the frequency has increased considerably compared to the past. Its quite sad actually, given that 851 was one of the pioneer services to get bendys other than 960 back then. Yes it is true that people have to end up standing on rigids if they are boarding after AMK central. But even if you add DDs to 851, its not going to impact the loading as much as 857 or 966. SMRT has been doing justice to the DDs by deploying them on services like 190, 857, 963, 966, 972 because these are the kind of routes that really utilize DDs well.</p>
              <p>For 190, 963, 972, 857 and 966, they are semi-express services and so they provide quick links as an alternative to MRT. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">But for 851, since it has no express sectors and most of the sectors are served by MRT as well, the load is pretty hard to go up. The uniqueness of this route has dropped over the years due to MRT developments too. Besides DDs are definitely going to push up the runtime for the 851 route compared to the rigids and bendys, eventually making MRT a faster option. So IMO, 851 can stay at similar ratio of SDs and HC buses maybe 3-4 upgrades at most.</span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Although 851 doesn't have express sectors, it does have many pax who take the svc over a long distance, eg Yishun - AMK/Marymount and AMK/Marymount - Little India/Rochor/Chinatown, who should be willing to go to the upper deck of DDs. I wouldn't say new MRT lines like CCL and DTL duplicate the route and remove its uniqueness, even the upcoming TEL doesn't directly duplicate 851. It's worth noting though that 851's route runs largely parallel to the yet-to-be-built NSE (North South Expressway), from Lentor to Little India/Rochor.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Personally, I think it may be a case of pent up demand like 857, where many potential pax choose to take other svcs instead, especially with other alternative svcs like 852, 54, 166 and 980.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Although dwell times would increase compared to the bendies used currently, 851 goes through quite a lot of city areas which would benefit from the decreased road space taken up, by using DDs instead. Looking at similar non-express SBST svcs from housing estates to the city like 51, 133, 143, 166, I personally think DDs would work, just that SMRT's lack of DDs (relative to SBST) means other svcs get them preferentially.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Although 851 doesn't have
              express sectors, it does have many pax who take the svc over a long
              distance, eg Yishun - AMK/Marymount and AMK/Marymount - Little
              India/Rochor/Chinatown, who should be willing to go to the upper
              deck of DDs. I wouldn't say new MRT lines like CCL and DTL
              duplicate the route and remove its uniqueness, even the upcoming
              TEL doesn't directly duplicate 851. It's worth noting though that
              851's route runs largely parallel to the yet-to-be-built NSE (North
              South Expressway), from Lentor to Little India/Rochor.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Personally, I think it may be a
              case of pent up demand like 857, where many potential pax choose to
              take other svcs instead, especially with other alternative svcs
              like 852, 54, 166 and 980.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 17.9055px;">Although dwell times would
              increase compared to the bendies used currently, 851 goes through
              quite a lot of city areas which would benefit from the decreased
              road space taken up, by using DDs instead. Looking at similar
              non-express SBST svcs from housing estates to the city like 51,
              133, 143, 166, I personally think DDs would work, just that SMRT's
              lack of DDs (relative to SBST) means other svcs get them
              preferentially.</p>

              <p>The future NSE does not allow an entry from Lentor.</p>
              <p>DDs on 851 would benefit. It is odd that this svc can go WAB without any high capacity buses that are WAB.</p>

              <p>Although 851 has dropped its number of bendys over the years, i
              must say the frequency has increased considerably compared to the
              past. Its quite sad actually, given that 851 was one of the pioneer
              services to get bendys other than 960 back then. Yes it is true
              that people have to end up standing on rigids if they are boarding
              after AMK central. But even if you add DDs to 851, its not going to
              impact the loading as much as 857 or 966. SMRT has been doing
              justice to the DDs by deploying them on services like 190, 857,
              963, 966, 972 because these are the kind of routes that really
              utilize DDs well.</p>
              <p>For 190, 963, 972, 857 and 966, they are semi-express services
              and so they provide quick links as an alternative to
              MRT. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">But for 851, since it
              has no express sectors and most of the sectors are served by MRT as
              well, the load is pretty hard to go up. The uniqueness of this
              route has dropped over the years due to MRT developments too.
              Besides DDs are definitely going to push up the runtime for the 851
              route compared to the rigids and bendys, eventually making MRT a
              faster option. So IMO, 851 can stay at similar ratio of SDs and HC
              buses maybe 3-4 upgrades at most.</span></p>
