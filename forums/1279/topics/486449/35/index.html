              <p>854 seriously needs a total fleet revamp. Despite going WAB last Oct, I still see several non-WAB bendies spamming on 854 especially on weekday peak hours. And to make matters worse it seems that some DDs from 854 had been running on its rival 857 lately, leaving 854 with no more than 50% WAB fleet running.</p>
              <p>I really want to see more DDs entering AMDEP to perm 854 by this year end. Best is 854 be part of the Sungei Seletar GCM package whereby SMRT doesn't win the bid.</p>

              <p>If I am not wrong, seems like only left with 3604Z and 3606T,
              sometimes zero. Even 5076J and 5077G nowadays keep doing on its
              rival 857, which I dunno why AMDEP like to pamper 857 so much. And
              also the fact that SMRT keep giving new DDs to the other 2 depots
              instead, I also dunno why.</p>
              <p>There are also several occurrences during weekday peak hours
              whereby out of 5 854 buses in sequence, only 1 of them is a WAB.
              This is getting very horrible.</p>
              <p>I really hope that AMDEP can swap out 4-5 DDs from 857 side with
              the old bendies from 854 so as to make it fair to the WAB quota for
              both services. Until the day when more DDs enter AMDEP.</p>

              <p>Those routes that ply within the city will get double deckers in priority. Since there will be more MAN A95s coming in, it's a matter of time that 854 gets more double deckers. And 857 is also partially controlled by Woodlands depot.</p>

              <p>No complaints doesnt mean that 854 need less DD. Yishun to YCK Rd already so packed during peak hour. 857 has bad frequency, 854 have alot of OCs and bendies. Would love to have more on 854. Plus it is the service that brings people to HG area from Yishun, surely there are a lot of them that commute on this service.</p>

              <p>Yes agree 854 needs more DDs. </p>
              <p>854 route can be cut short to Eunos since the part to Bedok is redundant with sv 25. 857 frequency has improved quite a bit. Service doing so much better now with &gt;50% DD fleet for a full rigid fleet. </p>

              <p>But to be honest 857s peak loading is between YCK Road industrial estate and Yishun (people also have 854 to choose here). The DDs get heavily used between 530-630pm.</p>
              <p>The crowd from Little India/Serangoon Road to Yishun hovers around 50-70 pax per bus but is more consistent and spread out from 530-730pm. </p>
              <p>857 as of today is doing quite decent in my opinion. 854 is the one that needs more SD-&gt;DD conversion because the number of rigids on this service is absolutely disapponting.</p>
