              <p>Recently I have strong feelings about 60kmh limit. </p>
              <p>I think a limit of a pathetic 60kmh is purely outrageous. Not only does passengers suffer from unnecessary extra travel times, it is harmful for the bus (particularly the Tridents, A22s and E500s) as they could not operate to their optimal performance. In turn this shoots back at the gvmt as buses age earlier and have to be maintained more frequently, and may affect the buses' resale value as well. </p>
              <p>I feel that it could be raised to 70kmh. What do you all think?</p>

              <p>The 50kph limit for army vehicles is lagi ridiculous. Even buses get held up by them... Moreover, some buses seem to cruise closer to 70kph (10kph allowance like the rest of us) while army vehicles can't even use the 10kph allowance. Stuck at 50kph.</p>
              <p>New buses I think can cruise comfortably at 70-80kph, so raising the speed limit for public buses at least on expressways to 70kph makes sense. I drive my 17-year-old van at that sort of speeds. Don't see why a professionally-maintained VO3X can't, much less a Wright or an E500. They even go around the bends faster and more comfortably than my van can...</p>
              <p>The common perception that speed kills is a joke. It's not speed that kills, it's bad driving habits that kill. You can go fast, just know when to go fast and when to slow down, and to always err on the side of caution.</p>

For commercial vehicles, it's just a sticker on the back and some beep beep device that just beeps at you when you hit the vehicle speed limit. So no reason to change speed limits for commercial vehicles. So many of them already go well over... They still have the cheek to tailgate me in the leftmost lane some more.</p></div>
