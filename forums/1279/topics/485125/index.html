              <p>Hey people, may I know which is better in terms of speed and chances of boarding a bus?</p>
              <p>1. MRT to Boon Lay -&gt; 179/179A</p>
              <p>2. MRT to Pioneer -&gt; 179</p>

              Time saved on 179A could be wasted on waiting for 179A at Int.
              179, you may not be able to board the first bus which arrives at pioneer. Then again sometimes 179A also screws up.
              
              This are my past experiences. I do not see much advantage taking one over the other. Same goes for return trips.

              <p>As a frequent traveler, let me provide you some options:</p>
              <p>1. Guaranteed seat : 179/179A from Boon Lay</p>
              <p>2. Fastest : 179 from Pioneer (frequency is good so if you see first bus is crowded  hope into the one behind)</p>
              <p>3. Crowd: there can be significant crowd boarding at Pioneer in a non-systematic way. If you want to avoid that  again board at Boon Lay. Journey time more by 10 mins if you choose Boon Lay over Pioneer</p>

              <p>Besides 179, you can try 199 and 241.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>During morning peak hours, bus 199 is used mainly by students going to Westwood Secondary School, students going to National Institute of Education and several old people (I do not know where in NTU campus they want to go, or if they are just taking the bus just for fun). </li>
              <li>Westwood Sec reporting time is 7.20am (as of 2012, when I was still a student there). After around 7.05am, the buses on service 199 departing Boon Lay Bus Interchange should be relatively empty as it would be used by only the remainder groups of passengers. 
              so why not take bus 199 instead, then make a transfer to bus 179 halfway at the bridge area, if your school is not within bus 199's coverage area but instead within bus 179's coverage area?</li>
              <li>However, consider it takes around 10 minutes to commute on bus 199 to Westwood Secondary School from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, <strong>it should take around 20 minutes to commute on bus 199 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange to the bridge area</strong>.
              Furthermore, there is heavy traffic congestion problem in the morning (until around 9am) along Jalan Bahar, especially between Jurong West Avenue 4 and the Pan Isand Expressway, which would lengthen the time taken to commute on bus 199 to the bridge area. So only consider this if you are very early for class.</li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
              <li> Alternatively, you can take bus 241 and alight at the bus stop opposite Xingnan Primary School. In the morning, the bus 241 section from Boon Lay Bus Interchange to Jurong West Street 91 is only crowded because people and students from other areas have to go to Xingnan Primary School, Juying Primary School or Juying Secondary School. After around 7.30am when the students are already at school, I do not think there would be much utilisation of bus service 241 in the section from Boon Lay Bus Interchange to Jurong West Street 91, so you can try taking bus 241 to go to NTU. From Boon Lay Bus Interchange/Pioneer MRT Station, you can take bus 241 and alight at the bus stop opposite Xingnan Primary School. From there, cross the road to the primary shool side, walk towards the canal, walk along the canal and climb the bridge, to go to the NTU park/garden, then walk the trail, climb the stairs, .... , and arrive at your school. You can consider this if your school is somewhere around the NTU park/garden. Travelling time from Boon Lay to Xingnan Primary School area is around 15 minutes. Walking time may be around 10-20 minutes. <strong>Total time should be around 25-35 minutes. So you should also only consider this if you are very early for class.</strong></li>

              <p>I appreciate your long essay. </p>
              <p>However, I will definitely not take 199 as it is not along the way to my destinatio. Anyways from the starter post you already can tell I can only take 179, otherwise I would not have posted at all (199 I know how to best take it). </p>
              <p>And you have not answered my question too. I believe that with 199's less frequent freq and the transfer I would have already long reached my destination using either of the two ways I have asked. </p>
              <p>241 is also out of the question. I would not consider walking as a way to enter the campus, especially with the monsoon season nearing. </p>
              <p>Thank you for your suggestion, I would appreciate it if you could tell me from Boon Lay or Pioneer?</p>

              <p>Go to Pioneer and take 179. You will also get a seat.</p>

                                  <p>I appreciate your long essay. </p>
                                  <p>However, I will definitely not take 199 as it is not along the
                                          way to my destinatio. Anyways from the starter post you already can
                                          tell I can only take 179, otherwise I would not have posted at all
                                          (199 I know how to best take it). </p>
                                  <p>And you have not answered my question too. I believe that with
                                          199's less frequent freq and the transfer I would have already long
                                          reached my destination using either of the two ways I have
                                          asked. </p>
                                  <p>241 is also out of the question. I would not consider walking as
                                          a way to enter the campus, especially with the monsoon season
                                          nearing. </p>
                                  <p>Thank you for your suggestion, I would appreciate it if you
                                          could tell me from Boon Lay or Pioneer?</p>

                                  <p>From my experience in the evening, it is easier to board bus 179 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange as only a few board at Boon Lay Bus Interchange while most commuters would board it at Pioneer MRT Station. I believe it is also like this in the morning.</p>
                                  <p>I cannot comment on 179A or compare it with 179 because I am not (yet) a student of NTU and I never commute on bus service 179A before.</p>
                                  <p>Nonetheless, I believe the queue for bus 179 at Boon Lay Bus Interchange is shorter than that of bus 179A, since one can only board 179A at Boon Lay Bus Interchange while 179 can board at any bus stop along Jurong West Street 63, Pioneer Road North and Pioneer MRT Station, besides Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
                                  <p>It should be faster if you alight at Boon Lay and take bus 179.</p>

              <p>There is no problem boarding 179 in PM at Pioneer. The high loading is mostly in AM.. There are people for Pioneer North Road for PM peak, but loading is not as high as AM buses. Pioneer loading for 241 is crazy in PM. Better to board 241 at Boon Lay if you want a seat.</p>

              <p> I second this and this is what I normally would do on a school day.</p>
              <p>Anyway OP can also consider taking Pioneer shuttle on weekends since it covers a much greater area of the school (although at a longer time).</p>
