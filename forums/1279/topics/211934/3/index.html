For a average Singaporeans, would they wanna know how the buses are deployed ? no.. they do not care.. all they wanna know is when their bus will arrive.. do they wanna care about the demand ? answer is also no. does it mean that by publishing the demands of each and every other service would mean that it will help to bring up the demand for other low demand services ?? It wouldnt help in anyway. If a route is low demand, it is low demand. by publishing the numbers would not help to bring it up. you talk about transparency. what is there to talk about ? ComfortDelgro is Not a Non-profit organisation who rely on public funds to run. Mind you.. They are a company who is profit driven. i do not think that you have the right to question them regarding this. It is already very good that they publish their monthly ridership. For all you know, they can actually dont do these.. Like i say.. Would an average joe cares about this ??</div>

Transparency also has its limits. Besides, demand of the services depend on many factors. In two to three years, when circle line is established, demand of services will change again. Maybe I should just let go and just let nature take its course.</div>
