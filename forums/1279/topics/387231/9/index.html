              <p><br> I myself have my frustrations too. I have placed hopes in that 857
              can be better improved during weekdays and weekends.</p>
              <p>Yes a public transport operator should exercise more
              responsibility - I've been duped many many times but there's
              nothing much I would do about it; I take it as part and parcel of
              everyday life and I'm glad I have a habit of leaving house much
              earlier for important appointments or events because there's no
              telling when something goes terribly wrong.</p>
              <p>Still, I'd like to see how it is like when SMRT rolls out the
              new/revised service changes next weekend first. :)</p>

              <p>think about it, that few buses that are being put to do RWS can actually be pumped back to their mainstream services. <br><br>yes, i may agree that perhaps that few buses are insignificant as compared to the fleet that smrt have. but what u guys seems to miss out is that that few buses can make a big difference in the freq.</p>

              <p>but then the question will be "WHEN"... if PTC never set the 10 min rule and LTA never set the WAB rule, do you think SMRT will buy new buses two years back when their buses still have not reach the lifespan yet?</p>

              <p>RWS68 &amp; 88 the most is 6 buses each.For 963R they operate along with its parent service but i suspect 8-10 buses.O530 Citaro demo maybe included?</p>

              <p>Hmm, i not so sure. Went to RWS ytd and saw about 4 OCs parked at the Basment Carpark awaiting start of trip. The frequency really quite quick. Anyway, the headway for RWS8 is 42 mins now with a 7-10 mins break in between trips. On the first day of operation (9/1/10), the headway was 50 mins with a 23 mins break in between each off-peak trip and 10 mins break during peak-period. The timesheet numbering from the bus i boarded to RWS was RWS8PM10, which suggests 10 buses being used. If your theory is right, then SMRT might classify the slots using even numbers only which is unlikely.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>We'll just have to wait till RWS88, RWS68 and 963R starts operations. This leads me to another problem. Since NR1 and NR6 would be made to call at RWS, does it mean that both these NR services will recieve OCs to meet the tender requirements?</p>

              <p><br>Do you understand the term "headway"? If not, please do not anyhow use it as and when it sounds good to you.</p>
              <p>Headway is the time period in between any 2 buses. 42 mins and 50 mins don't sound like headways.</p>

              <p><br>The loading is actually quite high for RWS88. I kept seeing buses with fully seated passengers, if not a few standees.Â Seems like for such a service the frequency is needed to be kept low.</p>
