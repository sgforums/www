              <p>They should engage a private bus operator with coaches instead for such services, since this is tourist attraction, rather than public buses using WAB buses with little seats. Moreover a bus company that can't even take care of its own services properly already and instead divert the buses to such shuttle services instead of improving its own public bus service standards.</p>
              <p>What a shame.</p>

              <p>I was just wondering on that considered CGA-Sentosa(RSW) svc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could it possibly be done with an IATA code and codeshared with airlines so pax can come out of planes and without lugging their luggage, go straight to Sentosa, knowing that their luggage is transfered directly to their end destination? Then there could be a "check-in" booth at the Sentosa end, so pax can tag their luggage directly to the overseas destinations without seeing it again(v.v at Changi) till the end destination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know this practice is done in other countries with rail and bus svc. Eurostar and some DB trains have codeshared IATA numbers. LH(Lufthansa German Airlines) and LOT Polish also have these codesharing svcs with buses with an similar(but not IATA) code.</p>
              <p>Closer to SIN, I know the City Air Terminal in the cities based for  KUL, BKK, and ICN have these services. They do draw pretty decent connecting traffic. A pretty promising scenario isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would it also be feasible if Singapore Airlines has its City Air Terminal at ION Orchard(where they have their office) and one at Sentosa RSW, and launch a SIA Hop-On bus to these two locations to merge their current City Hop-On and Sentosa Hop-On with the Airport, and it being the "official" CGA-City-Sentosa connection?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would like to hear your views.</p>

              <p><br>I do hope SIA can launch a dierct shuttle bus service to the 2 IRs from Changi Airport as well, on top of your proposal.</p>
              <p>Changi Airport -&gt; ECP -&gt; Rocher Road -&gt; Temasek Ave -&gt; (New Bridge link to Sands IR) -&gt; Marina Bay Sands -&gt; Bayfront Ave -&gt; Central Boulevard -&gt; Shenton Way -&gt; Keppel Road -&gt; Telok Blangah Road -&gt; Sentosa Getway -&gt; Sentosa IR</p>
              <p>Maybe Sentosa can also introduce some shuttle bus services to shopping/hotel areas like Marina Center, Novena and Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>For Ducktours, they can introduce their amphibious vehicle service from Sentosa to Harbourfront and their open top double decker sightseeing buses for a bus service to the city area.</p>

              <p><br>SMB 0098D, SMB 0118E. There's also a 'RWS8' operated using private buses, but that's meant for staff of RWS only.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Report: Day 1 in operation</span></strong></p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, the two buses were the only ones that operated on this service.</p>
              <p>Demand was very poor; only about an estimated 4 (mostly RWS staff) used the service. Overall, only about less than 10 - 20 pax used the service for the whole of the afternoon. Most of those who used it in the afternoon were bus fans.</p>
              <p>At the bus stops along Telok Blangah, only an 'RWS 8' plate was added to the bus stop poles. There were completely no press releases stuck to the information panels on the bus stop poles and almost all of the general public were totally unaware of the new service.</p>
              <p>However, the situation got worse inside RWS B1 carpark (where the RWS8 has a stop inside). There are two points inside the carpark where RWS8 can stop (which I would affectionately call them "A" for the one near the washroom and "B" for the one outside the main entrance, for the purpose of the report), but there were totally no signages informing passengers about where the bus will pickup/disembark them at "B", only an A4 sized paper which had the words "Press Conference". There were indeed a group of staff asking where to board the service at "A".</p>

              <p><br>I was there from 3pm to 5.30pm actually.</p>
              <p>In fact I was quite disappointed to learn about the low demand. But as of now, RWS is still not completed, so do the higher charges for private cars entering Sentosa being not in effect as yet, therefore what happens on the first day may not be a sign of what's to come in the near future. Perhaps ridership on RWS8 may rise some day, but till then, we wouldn't know if it will be a profitable route.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>To add on, I was thinking that Corp Comms didn't do their job of informing the general public of a new route. However, like I said earlier, RWS is not fully completed as yet. Touch-ups were still being done especially in and around the carpark area, so therefore the press release may have possibly been delayed in lieu of this.</p>

              <p><br>SMB 0098D, SMB 0118E. There's also a 'RWS8' operated using private buses, but that's meant for staff of RWS only.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Report: Day 1 in operation</span></strong></p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, the two buses were the only ones that operated on this service.</p>
              <p>Demand was very poor; only about an estimated 4 (mostly RWS staff) used the service. Overall, only about less than 10 - 20 pax used the service for the whole of the afternoon. Most of those who used it in the afternoon were bus fans.</p>
              <p>At the bus stops along Telok Blangah, only an 'RWS 8' plate was added to the bus stop poles. There were completely no press releases stuck to the information panels on the bus stop poles and almost all of the general public were totally unaware of the new service.</p>
              <p>However, the situation got worse inside RWS B1 carpark (where the RWS8 has a stop inside). There are two points inside the carpark where RWS8 can stop (which I would affectionately call them "A" for the one near the washroom and "B" for the one outside the main entrance, for the purpose of the report), but there were totally no signages informing passengers about where the bus will pickup/disembark them at "B", only an A4 sized paper which had the words "Press Conference". There were indeed a group of staff asking where to board the service at "A".</p>

              <p>The facility is not even fully completed yet, how can there be high demand of passengers boarding the shuttle service??</p>
