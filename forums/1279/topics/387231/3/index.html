              <p>Although the official press release by SMRT is still not out yet (as of 1351h when i last checked) , this is an alternative to support what SMB134H has said about RWS8 : <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/EDC100108-0000082/Gateway-to-a-smoother-entry">http://www.todayonline.com/Hotnews/EDC100108-0000082/Gateway-to-a-smoother-entry</a></p>

              <p>To TS:</p>
              <p>IMO, it is quite foolish of you to first of all, release this piece of info first, and then proceed to give clues about yourself, it is not worth the risk despite your noble intentions. The coy has ways and the means of tracking errant folks out, failing which, you will end up with a more difficult life with eyes on you and your colleagues. It will not be a pleasant experience. The coy like has very good reasons to keep such stuff under wraps.</p>

              <p>I think u are mistaken.</p>
              <p>What I mean is that since the info has been 'leaked', there's no point debating now whether it's true or not since the official announcement will be released by SMRT themselves.</p>
              <p>Hence, it is up to u all to decide whether the source is true. It is also on the onus of the person to decide whether he/she wants to release the classified info to the public before the official date. Should anything happens, the person shall take the rap. It's as simple as that.</p>
              <p>We, as public, may just view the info as reference and I believe ppl will wait till the official statement is up before we jump into conclusion.</p>

              <p>SMRT and Sentosa bus company are having talks of

              <p>I was just wondering on that considered CGA-Sentosa(RSW) svc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could it possibly be done with an IATA code and codeshared with airlines so pax can come out of planes and without lugging their luggage, go straight to Sentosa, knowing that their luggage is transfered directly to their end destination? Then there could be a "check-in" booth at the Sentosa end, so pax can tag their luggage directly to the overseas destinations without seeing it again(v.v at Changi) till the end destination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know this practice is done in other countries with rail and bus svc. Eurostar and some DB trains have codeshared IATA numbers. LH(Lufthansa German Airlines) and LOT Polish also have these codesharing svcs with buses with an similar(but not IATA) code.</p>
              <p>Closer to SIN, I know the City Air Terminal in the cities based for  KUL, BKK, and ICN have these services. They do draw pretty decent connecting traffic. A pretty promising scenario isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would it also be feasible if Singapore Airlines has its City Air Terminal at ION Orchard(where they have their office) and one at Sentosa RSW, and launch a SIA Hop-On bus to these two locations to merge their current City Hop-On and Sentosa Hop-On with the Airport, and it being the "official" CGA-City-Sentosa connection?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Would like to hear your views.</p>

              <p>As it is, you won't know what is it like to be caught unless you've been caught for breach of company policies. You don't just risk your job on a personal level, you risk your integrity when you breach what you signed, and worse, potential employers can be informed if they wish to find out why you left your previous job abruptly if it ever gets to that.</p>
              <p>It's not pleasant.</p>
              <p>Are we to encourage such behaviour?</p>
