              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Report: Resorts World Sentosa Day one in operation; 11th Day for RWS8</span></strong></p>
              <p>Along with frequents SMB 0098D and SMB 0118E, 6 more were observed to have joined the service, all bearing the authorised Resorts World Sentosa advertisment, as was required by RWS in their tender. They are: SMB 0021A, SMB 0022Y, SMB 0029D, SMB 0036H, SMB 0037E and SMB 0038C.</p>
              <p>Changes were made to the EDS. Initially supposed to show only "RWS 8", additional info was presented. The service number was moved to the right, while the words "Resorts World Sentosa" was added to show that the service plied to RWS.</p>
              <p>Bus stop infrastructure was slightly upgraded as well. The exact bus stop location in Resorts World Sentosa has been marked out more clearly by the columns which had the words "SMRT Buses" and hence, a dedicated lane for the RWS8 buses. Dedicated bus stops for RWS8 were present, most notably the one outside Vivocity.</p>
              <p>The number of buses added to the fleet was just right. During the mid-afternoon, loading was high, but not to the extent that buses were packed like sardines (I took SMB 0118E into RWS). However, when I went out of RWS at around 1720 hrs, all passengers were seated (I took SMB 0021A out of RWS).</p>
              <p>During my afternoon spotting, which lasted from around 1445 hrs to 1730 hrs (note that in this point, I'm talking about what's observed on the service itself and not Resorts World Sentosa), the majority of the passengers were observed to be mainly senior citizens. There were indeed some teenagers and some adults, but children (including infants and babies in arms) did not quite seem to form the bulk of the passengers. Interestingly, at 1730 hrs, when I alighted from the bus, there were some students who were in their school uniforms (also taking RWS8) who also wanted to catch a glimpse of Resorts World Sentosa.</p>
              <p>Overall, thanks to the help of some last minute publicity, the increased charges for private cars/reduced charges for public buses into Sentosa as well as the RWS8 signages and other infrastructure, many heeded the call to use public transport to enter the Resorts World Sentosa. Congestion was not a major problem for almost any bus, save for some slight bottleneck over at Telok Blangah Rd when RWS8 buses attempted to turn out of the Vivocity bus stop.</p>

              <p>1. Regarding T&amp;Cs, approach Sentosa and RWS. They made the
              rules. SMRT follows.</p>
              <p>2. The shuttle service is awarded through tender. If SMRT gives
              good proposal, I don't see why RWS can't choose.</p>
              <p>3. Most RWS services runs on weekends, which are the days where
              SMRT usually do most charter. With the amount of buses used on
              weekends and PH, I don't see how the charter will impact revenue
              services so much.</p>
              <p>4. Using "rundown buses" for public services. I would think if
              given a choice SMRT would not put new buses on schedule charters,
              aka IKEA or Poly shuttles.</p>
              <p>5. Hippo and SIA Hop-on have public service announcements (aka
              "Please move to the rear")? Someone besides vicamour please
              enlighten me.</p>
              <p>6. If you live in the SMRT areas long enough, you will know ways
              to beat the "poor connectivity".</p>

              <p>SIA Hop-on buses do not have "automated" public service announcements. But they can always be made by the driver and attendant(on the certain occasions when she is present)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>there is a limit on how much buses they can deploy on certain services esp 190/980. 190 is already having great frequencies. more buses mean more jams.. and esp along orchard during weekend? the traffic are heavy and buses are alway caught in jam..and for certain period, demands are one sided... in morning, buses to CCK are not full. for Sv 980, they alway deploy bendy buses on weekend (but they can make it full fleet bendy on weekend lah).. They can make it 5 mins frequency one way (to City during afternoon) but what abt the return trip? all buses are empty and then ppl will complain again why Sv980 to SBW come at 5 mins and all buses are empty? why sv167 come at 12 mins etc etc... all these also apply to SBST (which reduces a lot of buses on weekend)</p>

You also reminded me that bendies pose a problem to in the crowded roads in Singapore, so this is an example on why this is one of the reasons that LTA bans bendy buses, because they take up a lot of road space and in bus bays, which cause long bus queues. </p>
              <p>As for 960 and 980, they do not have fantastic frequencies at night, especially 980, the range is around 14 minutes. So why not put more buses instead??? And it doesn't have to be a two way service to service the commuters. How about a short working trip, like 960A or 980A??? Monitoring the commuters travelling pattern and introduce such short working trip services, for example, 980, if the commuter loadings are heavy from Bugis to Novena, then why not a short working trip from North Bridge Road to Novena MRT??? If SMRT wants to maximize its resources to squeeze out more profits to their shareholders, then the buses after these shortworking trips can be used to run NR services from city or Employee Buses to sent employees home at night. And all these services can be serviced by night shift BCs.</p>

              <p>We must always remember that when a bus company seems to be
              doing nothing, it does not mean they are really doing nothing.
              Remember people are complaining SMRT has no WAB buses? Yah the OCs
              just popped out at UCC in 2008.</p>

              <p>That was because the govt step in and force them to buy WAB buses. <br><br>If the law wasnt put in place, u think smrt will buy new buses ? <br></p>
