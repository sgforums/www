              <p>Why dont you ask yourself why?</p>
              <p>While we are on the topic, have you learnt how to <a href="/forums/1279/topics/476267?page=2">get around NUS</a> with my guide (or lack of, since I was "putting you down")? </p>
              <p>I made an offer to TEACH you, what did you do?</p>
              <p>You ignored me.</p>
              <p>Oh I kinda expected that, since the only type of information you appear to consider "useful" is information useful to YOURSELF.</p>
              <p>And why should I post any useful material here?</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1279/topics/475025?page=4">Pervertedboy's post</a> carries more weight than you can appear to imagine.</p>
              <p>What did you say? <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Lollll.. And his posts are only about buses.</span></p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>That's all?</p>
              <p>I have also told you more than a few times, cautioning YOU amongst others, that digging for information is less than correct. What did you do?</p>
              <p>You ignored as usual.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>So when those like myself try to stop wilful postings, you ignore the furore, and then turn around and say I am unhelpful? Please reflect. I think the fact that Gemilang instructed ADAMS to take the pictures down is instructive of what we can expect from firms trying to do business. PLEASE REFLECT.</p>
              <p>Friend, this is a FREE forum. The perk of which is "freedom", yet the same has its downsides, which you have now termed me as such.</p>
              <p>Not like I bother though. </p>
              <p>I have been around a long long time. I wouldnt be staying around here if my self-worth is measured by the likes of you. </p>
              <p>Unlike many of the keyboard warriors here, I have showed my face to some in sgforums, and know them personally. You? Perhaps you have too. But I assume that you think I am just someone hiding behind my com.<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Lastly!</p>
              <p>I am flattered that you asked me to "grow up". It is rather unfortunate, but my growth stopped years ago. But I still think I am young at heart. Thank you for acknowledging that.</p>
              <p>Finally, the childish me demands a response on your part.</p>
              <p>You better.</p>
              <p>Because otherwise I will just "put you down" further and "see you no up".<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

He "flame" people most of the time people wont flame back one, you are one daring fellow who created a mess out of nothing (which you thought was a mess).
