              <p>MAN is more reliable then Volvo from what I have seen and drive
              . I am a SAF Truck driver and normally I drive A MAN 5tonner ( the
              old one ) . Mind you the old 5 tonner is about 15 years old already
              given it been gone through muds,Rocky roads and harsh weather
              conditions and come out fine (break down is there but very little )
              . Man built one of the best reliable engine out there . Just go to
              YouTube and type in MAN U boat engine and you will see why . U boat
              engine with Man engine survive until today and still running strong
              . A 1920s MAN engine is still running strong is what I call
              reliability.  And also MAN has bigger parts here given STK is
              their distributor.  Is not that I hate Volvo but I just don't
              like the Swedish as the Swedish thinks they are better then
              everyone because they got a Alps . </p>

              <p>LTA will likely choose the route that will past by crowded areas . Services like 147 as you mention past by Chinatown/ Little India but Sv7( which I think will be the one chosen )passes by Orchard road and Bugis street. Sv 7 is more busier then sv 147 during weekday as every peak sv7 deploy every 5 mins and still there is NO seats after a few stops . This is how crowded sv7 is and therefore is the best candidate to trial the 3 door flow </p>

              <p>it a waste, 857 always full of people from little india to yishun. when it deployed on 143 the bus is fully use. if on 147 which is almost the same route as 143 at chinatown but 147 have mrt cover it route. 143 things is people board the bus at bus stop far from mrt station. even the route covered by mrt most of it like 147. 23 is the best but if LTA can extend 23 back to where it old service route will be better. </p>

              <p>it a waste, 857 always full of people from little india to
              yishun. when it deployed on 143 the bus is fully use. if on 147
              which is almost the same route as 143 at chinatown but 147 have mrt
              cover it route. 143 things is people board the bus at bus stop far
              from mrt station. even the route covered by mrt most of it like
              147. 23 is the best but if LTA can extend 23 back to where it old
              service route will be better. </p>

              <p>Most 857 loads between Little India and Yishun are around 50-55 pax so even SDs seem okay. Hence, 857 haven't got more DDs after the initial DD boom once SMRT took over.</p>
              <p>Main DD loading for 857 is YCK Road to Khatib where buses take 100 pax. Here you also have 854, hence I think we see 50-60% DDs on 857 only. </p>

              <p>@Formususeonly: service 7 also considerable not just of the core
              city areas this service passes through but the route is less draggy
              especially from Clement to orachard via entire Holland areas but
              also from bedok to bugis not too draggy as well. But for Service
              147 duplicate part of NE line yet the loading is still strong
              enough as a alternative. Loading from hougang to bed is very
              demanding especially peak periods. Morning or evening regardless at
              any day.</p>

              <p>I think both 7 and 147 are good candidates. 14, 166, 196 only peak hour loading, hence would prefer 7, 147. After DTL3, I am not sure 65 still seems an attractive option(?)</p>

              <p>you dont want to stand throughout your ride between Khatib and City. the Rigids on 857 aren't arriving that frequently either. 854 even had many bendies instead.</p>

              <p>Lol. Call yourself a bus fan and you don't even know who call the shots. LTA is the one who determine which slots get high capacity buses. Not the operator.</p>
