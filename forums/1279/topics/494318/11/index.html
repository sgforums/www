              <p>Industrial analysis:</p>
              <p>This launch is a big deal. Looks like STK/MAN want the whole production 3-door or/and Euro 6 bus contract <em>really, really badly</em>.</p>
              <p>If there is one TIB838H moment in BCM, this is it - to become the first Euro 6 public bus to be introduced in Singapore. They didn't airlift the whole unit into Singapore this time because they didn't have to (but it is possible the Euro 6 engine may have to be flown in to meet the deadline though). We are not going to have newer emission standards for quite a while (Euro VII doesn't exist yet).</p>
              <p>All three major DD manufacturers have gone to lengths not to alert their competition to what they were doing, but only STK/MAN was successful. It is unfortunate that ADL and Volvo were exposed by bus lobbyists (either by chance or deliberately) before they could make their proper move. That may have tipped STK/MAN to push their product out to market more quickly to have the first-mover advantage.</p>
              <p>Some may think that using SG5999Z rear door configuration as the scale bus model in 
                                                  presentation to PM Lee on the ceremony was some sort of mistake. It isn't. There is a very good reason why this particular scale bus model was used for this particular launch occasion.</p>
              <p>If STK/MAN in the meantime, with the introduction of SG2017C, trial of SG5999Z and advantage of incumbency, manages to convince LTA they can do the 3-door Euro 6 DD production run cheaper and faster than the other two (and that probability is quite high), then it's Game Over for ADL and Volvo.</p>
              <p>This is very important contract for the manufacturers because once LTA commits, it will be for a very, very long time and they don't switch easily. The Kawasaki MRT train contracts (from C151 to C151C to T251) is an example of that.</p>

              <p>MAN is more reliable then Volvo from what I have seen and drive . I am a SAF Truck driver and normally I drive A MAN 5tonner ( the old one ) . Mind you the old 5 tonner is about 15 years old already given it been gone through muds,Rocky roads and harsh weather conditions and come out fine (break down is there but very little ) . Man built one of the best reliable engine out there . Just go to YouTube and type in MAN U boat engine and you will see why . U boat engine with Man engine survive until today and still running strong . A 1920s MAN engine is still running strong is what I call reliability.  And also MAN has bigger parts here given STK is their distributor.  Is not that I hate Volvo but I just don't like the Swedish as the Swedish thinks they are better then everyone because they got a Alps . </p>

              <p>ADL's 3-door configuration was the preferred one. For STK/MAN to succeed they have to convince LTA that it is not worth the cost.</p>
              <p>If LTA accept STK/MAN's 3-door configuration, the market will open up to other players such as Volvo. But this is where Volvo will come under pressure, because STK/MAN has just taken away their Euro 6 first-mover advantage.</p>

              <p>Industrial analysis:</p>
              <p>This launch is a big deal. Looks like STK/MAN want the whole
              production 3-door or/and Euro 6 bus contract <em>really, really
              badly</em>.</p>
              <p>If there is one TIB838H moment in BCM, this is it - to become
              the first Euro 6 public bus to be introduced in Singapore. They
              didn't airlift the whole unit into Singapore this time because they
              didn't have to (but it is possible the Euro 6 engine may have to be
              flown in to meet the deadline though). We are not going to have
              newer emission standards for quite a while (Euro VII doesn't exist
              yet).</p>
              <p>All three major DD manufacturers have gone to lengths not to
              alert their competition to what they were doing, but only STK/MAN
              was successful. It is unfortunate that ADL and Volvo were exposed
              by bus lobbyists (either by chance or deliberately) before they
              could make their proper move. That may have tipped STK/MAN to push
              their product out to market more quickly to have the first-mover
              advantage.</p>
              <p>Some may think that using SG5999Z rear door configuration as the
              scale bus model in presentation to PM Lee on the ceremony was some
              sort of mistake. It isn't. There is a very good reason why this
              particular scale bus model was used for this particular launch
              occasion.</p>
              <p>If STK/MAN in the meantime, with the introduction of SG2017C,
              trial of SG5999Z and advantage of incumbency, manages to convince
              LTA they can do the 3-door Euro 6 DD production run cheaper and
              faster than the other two (and that probability is quite high),
              then it's Game Over for ADL and Volvo.</p>
              <p>This is very important contract for the manufacturers because
              once LTA commits, it will be for a very, very long time and they
              don't switch easily. The Kawasaki MRT train contracts (from C151 to
              C151C to T251) is an example of that.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Surprised SMRT still stuck with Kawasaki/CRRC despite the glaring defects in the C151A railcars. If it had been me, the C151C and CT251 contracts might have been given to someone else.</p>
