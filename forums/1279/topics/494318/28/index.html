              <p>Well, as you said, trial. </p>
              <p>If you have looked through tender specs for EDS/PIDS, it asks
              for both VDV 300 and VDV 301 compatibility. Funny thing is, VDV 301
              is not even bought by LTA. </p>
              <p>You know what's the biggest joke? VDV300 is an outdated
              protocol, instead of just bringing in VDV301, they'd rather spend
              money on both VDV300 and VDV301 just so that it works as an interim
              solution. </p>
              <p>They could have just upgraded the backend to VDV301 and spec in
              new buses with VDV301 only. This way, you would'nt need to spend
              unnecessary tax payer's money on the old VDV300 on every single
              bus.</p>

              EDS?</p>

              <p>It's like buying a Mac to run a Windows program. Then having to buy Parallels to install Windows. When there is already a working Mac program for the same thing.</p>
              <p>White LED EDS will eventually be the default. It's already the case in Perth.</p>

              <p>You may have a point there, though this might seem insensitive to the disabled community in Sg. IMO the crux of the matter is how LTA's bid to be more 'inclusive' has inevitably become a zero-sum game for everyone and not so much because of the 'weird' concepts. Still though, it's hard to completely blame LTA for this particularly as it has to deal with conflicting interests among different groups of communters and the end result of trying to please everyone turns out disastrous.</p>

              <p>That is to comply with ADR (Australian law). They have ridiculous rules too, such as the 2.5m width requirement, but their PIW space specification was spot on.</p>
              <p>It is possible to cover the exposed bolts and still allow the sliding mechanism to function. An emergency brake and fall onto to sharp edges of the foldable rail may cause someone to require stitches!</p>
