              <p>They are resurrecting bus routes that were withdrawn in any of the MRT rationalisation exercises. But there will not be anymore bus services to Shenton Way, simply put because it is too congested with all the Premiums and City Directs (651-672).</p>
              <p>Other than that, I saw another deviation - which is 7A and 7B into Orchard Road.</p>

              <p>Seriously speaking, LTA had made a very bad move since last Dec. I dun understand why LTA want extend lifespan of those old bendies even though there are enough B3 A95s to replace them. In fact I had been looking forward to see more WAB DD buses to replace the old bendies, especially on the Sembawang-Yishun package side. Even 184 is not receiving any DDs and still using so many old bendies despite going WAB last Dec.</p>
              <p>Instead LTA go and introduce so many useless routes and wasted so many new A95s down there. The new A95 units should be put to SMRT to replace every single old bendy that is due for retirement after reaching 17 years, not to put up a show on those low demand new routes.</p>
              <p>Those express services like 12e and 147e should just deploy full fleet single decks from their respective spare fleet. And I also dun see a need for 7A and 7B to be deployed with full fleet DD as well.</p>
              <p>Since SBST had taken in 6 new E6 A95 units, they should be given to HGDEP as there are a number of outgoing Tridents that are going to be next in line to retire. Tridents getting lifespan extension is the last thing that I want to see from LTA, also given their poor conditions.</p>

              so many new A95s down there. The new A95 units should be put to
              SMRT to replace every single old bendy that is due for retirement
              after reaching 17 years, not to put up a show on those low demand
              new routes.</p>
              <p>Those express services like 12e and 147e should just deploy full
              fleet single decks from their respective spare fleet. And I also
              dun see a need for 7A and 7B to be deployed with full fleet DD as
              well.</p>
              <p>Since SBST had taken in 6 new E6 A95 units, they should be given
              to HGDEP as there are a number of outgoing Tridents that are going
              to be next in line to retire. Tridents getting lifespan extension
              is the last thing that I want to see from LTA, also given their
              poor conditions.</p>
              <p>I am not going to fight a war here but this is just my
              thoughts.</p>

              <p>agree with most of your points... esp on 12e/147e/7A/7B.</p>
              <p>7A/7B should just be withdrawn and they can just easily add 6 buses to sv7 to improve the frequency... (right now,there are a lot of bunching of 7A/7B/7 buses and also when 7A/7B turn around to serve as sv7). </p>
              <p>for 2A, they can simply withdrawn the am trips..additional buses deploy on sv2 toward Chinatown should return to tanah merah off service to start new trips, rather than running empty trips on 2A. same go for the PM peak, whereby 2A buses should return off service to chinatown to start new trips.</p>

              <p>true.. like what i said, LTA does not see the need to give more DD for sv851 (which mean that LTA feel that the demand is not there)... so why does LTA decide to introduce 851E with full fleet DDs? to cater for MRT breakdown? </p>

              <p>Hmm so when people say 851 DD not enough, I suppose it means
              should add more peak DD's (lets say 10-12) but still 3-4 DD's
              during off peak ah? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Like that a lot of idle DD's during off peak leh.  And not really possible to zhong DD's from other services to crossover during peak hours coz those services will also need their DD's during peak.</p>
