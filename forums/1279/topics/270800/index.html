            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it that Germany's bus system can follow a given timetable with at most 5 minutes difference?<br><br>Why is it that Singapore's buses can come 3 buses in a row, and not well spread out?<br><br>I'm talking here about buses that do come in 20 minutes interval. I have personally seen at HarbourFront interchange: 3 bus 188 coming in one after another, and 10 mins later, 3 bus 963 coming into the interchange one after another.<br><br>We all understand that it may be the fact that drivers drive at different speeds. This is something that can be worked upon. The drivers could drive at speeds which would allow them to reach a certain bus stop/check point at a certain time. This way, the bus timings would be kept rather constant.<br><br>With our "high-tech" GPS systems installed in the bus, I would suppose it wouldn't be much of a hassle too if we install a small device to inform the driver whether he should drive faster or slower to the next bus stop.<br><br>What do you all think?</div>

But accidents rate are that much lower. Any reason?<br><br>Most of these happen on services that have longer bus routes. The problem here is that the difference in driving speeds will magnify when the route is longer.<br><br>Speed manipulation should have been done all the while during the drive to ensure that such events do not happen as frequent.</div>

They drive numerous hours every day. They drive on fixed routes unlike taxi drivers. They see almost the same things daily over and over again as they may drive the route a few times per day. It can be rather mundane. It is already hard to attract people to take on bus driving as they are facing lots of restrictions to satisfy the consumer's demand. There is a newspaper article on The Straits Times stating some jobs that very few Singaporeans are willing to take up. Bus Captain is one of the jobs listed in the article.<br><br>No doubt I am a consumer, the fact that SBST has introduced IRIS system has enhanced things greatly as we know where is our next bus going to arrive.<br><br>Besides, different BCs are different in terms of their way of driving. Some of them drive recklessly while some drive cautiously. Many SBST drivers slow down their speed when the bus approaches the traffic junction. However, some drivers drive very fast and change lanes frequently to rush back to the interchange.<br><br>Actually, normally for most journeys in singapore, after every bus stop, the bus will approach a traffic junction. I rmb LTA introduces a rule that the traffic lights will show green all the way along a road with many traffic junctions for the convenience of motorists. Imagine this, for most SBST drivers, after the traffic lights turn green, the bus will accelerate and stop at a bus stop. Then, it will accelerate again. However, by the time when it approaches the next traffic junction, the traffic lights will be turning red. This is due to the fact that the duration of the traffic lights staying at green is similar to the time required for a bus to travel from a traffic light to another traffic light which includes a stop at the bus stop. And thanks to the rule mentioned above, buses are approaching more red lights than green lights instead of 50:50.</div>

When it beeps at the bus stop, the bus driver would drive normally. If it beeps way before the bus stop, the driver will accelerate like siao. If it beeps way after the bus stop, the driver might take 10 minutes just to earn some red lights and the journey to Eunos MRT would take about 10 minutes. (I kena before.)</div>
