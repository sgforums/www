What abt the other 100? CRBs as well which is due by 2006? If this is true, SMRTB seems not interested... DD will have to wait for Euro4. My guess has been right as they are trying to sell the Mk2 on the net</div>

It is not surprising at all for me, 'cos I believe something like this might happen, and voila - It did! Although SBST have such close ties with Volvo, being a commercial company, they will go for the best offer around, and that best offer might not always come from Volvo themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i suppose u r referring to B7RLE. other chassii that can support CNG (and some biogas too) are B10L, B10LA and B10BLE. the new fuels coming your way are hydrogren, hybrid (joint gas and battery, like the Toyota Prius car) and DME (dimethyl ethter).<br><br>the B12BLE does not supoprt gas as a fuel source yet. i wonder where u can put the CNG tank on a DD. currently, for heavy-duty needs, you have to rely on B10LA or MAN's artic's.<br><br>note that B10M is no longer offered. whether it is out of production not so sure yet.<br><br></div>

The last Mk II's will retire after a year on 5th April 2006.<br><br>Note that the order of air-con refurbishment is erratic so I cannot give exact figures on how many are refurbished or not. As a guide (not verified), there are about 91 NAC Mk II's (64 W.

            <div class='col-md body'>i really find it funny. why bother to air-condition those MK2s and CRBs when they are going to be retired. Isn't it a waste of $$. Anyway, any guess where these new buses will go to? My guess would be HGDEP and BBDEP since they have a number of MK2s (esp. HGDEP). But i'm wondering whether will it really go to HGDEP as HGDEP has always been dominated by Volvos. Do take a shot of Hougang/Sengkang buses operating out of HGDEP having a merc O405. Anyway correct me if i'm wrong.</div>

SBST is definitely not buying anything other than O.500LE from Mercedes-Benz.<br><br>and no guesses where the new buses will go to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> we can wait till we are sure these O.500Le's are coming before we answer this.<br><br>and dun worry, those O.405's in hgdep are perm. they belong to svc 100 and were x-fer to hgdep from amdep following shift of control of 100 to hgdep. eventually these buses will move back to amdep, like many of their former 100 O.405 counterparts. these buses are:<br>326L<br>335K<br>345G<br>535R<br>3826R<br>3902D</div>
