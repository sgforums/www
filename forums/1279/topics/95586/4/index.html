            <div class='col-md body'>So Windy has driven/riden on the Citaro with the 6.4 litre engine before ?<br>Where would that have taken place ? I don't recall of any Citaro demo bus for sampling in Singapore or Malaysia before ??<br><br>Anycase the original standard engine for the Citaro is 12 litres, like the O 405 before it. But noteworthy about this newer 6.4 litre engine is that it's of new generation design with multi-valves, charged-cooling with advanced management electronics such that despite it's small size the output can be rated @ 280 BHP with Euro2 emissions levels ! This can be viewed as adequete as Euro3 buses are not yet the norm in Singapore. Of course if they want the latest Euro3 or coming Euro4 engines, then i suppose they revert to using the 12 litre engines rated @ say 250 BHP for rigid bus deployment &amp; say 300 BHP for articulated bus.<br><br>By the way, their new 6.4 litre engine does compare very well with almost any other the Euro 2 engines of similar or even larger capacity in performance. 280 BHP from only 6.4 litre how many other engines produce so much from so little ?? Currently very few.<br><br>Going by my personal experiences just yesterday taking Handal Indah's route 22 from Permas Jaya to JB city in their new M-B with new generation engines, i'm quite optimistic such new generation engines although small in cc the acceleration, power torque outputs can match or exceed older design engines of even double the cc !! There's limits to what can be done to gearing to boost performance perhaps, beyond that i'll say engine performance &amp; engine efficiency takes over. The 'push from behind' was strong, quick &amp; fairly silent as the bus climbed up the slope near the new CIQ complex under construction, mainly only the turbo whine with hardly much gearbox noise from the manual gear (suspect to be M-B original gearbox with 5-speeds) in fact i'll even say this is more what should be expected from the buses in Singapore instead !<br>Those ZF or Voith gearboxes used in Singapore on the whole i find them too noisy &amp; harsh !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yusry:</div><div class="quote_body">If Singapore does ever get the Citaros, I hope they do not buy it with the standard 6 litre engines. From Windy's experience, their performance is absolutely pathetic. Even the Routemasters could outrun them on hill climbs.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The engine capacities about the same BUT the engine technology, design &amp; generation are light years apart, i observe.<br><br>The Dennis Darts i've riden in Holland Village in Singapore before hardly can move themselves, even on a level road !! It has to struggle almost all the way ! I believe it's from Cummings ?? I'm very sure if they drop this new generation M-B diesel in instead, the whole damn thing would blast off like a small rocket !<br><br>Analogy i'll use is like the 2.2 litre engines used in the M-B taxi here. You can compare this with say a 3 litre or 2.7 litre engine from Toyota or Nissan taxis here the differences in engine performance, noise vibration harshness levels, exhaust emission levels are so obvious that the small cc engine is light years ahead of the 2 larger cc but more backward engines !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">6 litres?

It also retains the longitudinal seats over the rear wheelarches and the red BUS STOPPING sign and the handrail behind the upper deck windscreen, and the big-arse gutters above the top deck windows. Its days being governed to 35mph [60kph] have totally screwed the vehicle, it was a real shed to ride (although Voith Olympians are usually shockers to ride anyway). I must say, the single pane windows with the odd hopper window make it a tonne nicer to look at than the tropical windows with the three horizontal bars across the windows for body protrusion prevention (although it didn't quite redeem the lack of power, and rather noticeable turbo lag this bus had). Still, I was glad to get a pic, and now that I do, it can be either scrapped, sold or repainted."</div>

Anyway, the VO2X looks similar to many of those found in HongKong.</div>

That is about the same size as a Dennis Dart engine!</div></blockquote>Yusry and Suhirman,<br><br>Yes, they have a 6.33L engine.  hseochin can also confirm this, I'm sure, since he is also pretty specced up on the buses.  It is the equivalent of putting the 1.2L engine from a Lancer into a Tank!  I personally find the build and finish of the Citaros pretty bad...a Custom Coaches CB60 body would be much more suitable, with the lower plastic content.  The suspension is a little harsh, compared to the O.405, but the B12BLE is a vast improvement on previous Volvo air suspension.  Even the Hino RM197K has a tiny 6.8L engine.  The RM230 has a larger engine which sounds like it means business.  the CM has a 13 litre naturally aspirated engine.<br><br>The Citaro's width is some 5mm wider than the standard citybus.  The O.303s with the Mannheim bodies are very nice, and being a firm believe in the V8 engines they produce, I am disappointed at the lack of V8 option in the Australian market for the O.500RF coach chassis.  I am even more disappointed at the lack of hub reduction, although the hypoid rear axle will make a similar (though quieter) whirring noise.</div>
