            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing this long thread, i really have to salute the mk2s, and also the LO2x..<br>the LO2x served many services, especially the JIS for a long period of time. the buses has a higher capacity than the VO2x. also, i had taken LO2x when 97 was still NAC svcs, right up to 97 becomes FAC, thereafter, on JIS services. without them, JIS may had a bad time.<br><br>for the mk2s especially WA body), well, one big group of them had served the famous 170, with the tireless trips to Larkin. Many passengers had relied on it to go to JB. long-lasting and durable, the mk2s performed its best on the long 170 journey. long queues and cramped 170 were normal on 170 that time.  Now, its heydays are over, and they are mostly left to run "simple routes" like 125 and Bukit Merah feeders, exceptions are 151.<br><br>However, mk2s has a strange property in its good ability to heat up in hot afternoons. Long trips can be tiring and sleepy, but overall, rides on it were good and enjoyable, maybe because of its engine sound and its "rickety" interior condition. the same goes to the LO2x. Simple yet useful, these 2 buses would be missed by me..<br><br>Another bus i have to add is the Scanias CRB. Even though i dont ride on them very often, their quiet engine impresses me, and any long journey was never a "threat" to me as they travels at a reasonable speed, and i liked scanias psychologically.<br><br>Finally, are the MBO405s. like the VO2x, hey can make even a short trip a nightmare. Slow in moving, and hot all the time. the MBO405 are also famous for hot-con.. Grew up taking them, i only liked their CACs as the aircon was cold. However, overall, these 2 buses (MBO405 and VO2x) are condemned by me! Slow and Hot.. and the standees on the MB certainly dont help things out..<br>Good Riddance to them!<br><br>Well. Farewell to the departed tireless mk2s and the hardy LO2x!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

The other bus i will miss in the near future will definitely be the MB0405. Till now, i can't imagine the sight of SBST without 0405s. Looks so "hollow".<br><br>As for the reason to why LTA extend the lifespan of the Mk2s.......perhaps the drivers don't want them to leave?? =P Perhaps they are more pleasant to drive then those Mk3s and are fondly liked by the BCs. Another more pratical reason might be that they want to incoporate them into training buses?</div>
