They will get a refurbn in due course, where they have different air-powered door mechanisms, with individual arms, which they fitted progressively to the O.405 fleet even when they were stil NAC because of the said door issues.  It came down to the regulators in the doors only working to a certain amount of pressure to close the door, but not keep it closed (to a certain angle, one the angle increased, air pressure is also increased, so it stays in a certain position.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Overall speaking, i find it a matter of course that the Scanias are THE more well engineered &amp; 'refined' lot of buses compared to the Volvo B10M (whatever Mk.) eventhough in design age the N113's here are older than many of the B10M's here.<br><br>But also of course, my statements above are valid only upon the assumption of a properly maintained N113 i.e. N113 without all those over jerky gearchanging or excessive engine vibrations &amp; noise due to too low engine idling speeds set etc. !! On almost ANY vehicle (even the top class marques) if they are not maintained up to the standard they're supposed to be in &amp; designed to be, then the resulting experience can seem very lousy, maybe even perceived to be worse than some lousier marque but maintained in better conditions.<br><br>Vehicles with sub-standard maintenance &amp; condition i don't recognize as i don't allow any such deviations from the original 'set norms' to influence my judgement as to whether, overall speaking, the model is 'good' or not. Only those in acceptable servicible condition to me i recognize &amp; fortunately i do know there remains quite a good number of N113's here still in good enough form as not deserving to be written off as yet.<br><br>That's why my stand has been &amp; remains that between the N113 &amp; B10M (any Mk.) the N113 remains the better bus to be on !<br><br>Yes the Scania engine technology of charge-cooling &amp; full engine encapsulation etc. was somewhat ahead of time in 1989 &amp; even today remains quite technically advanced although many others have since narrowed the gap.<br>The suspension ride comfort on the N113, although noisy &amp; lousy (compared to O 405 &amp; O 305 standards) still is overall superior to that on the B10M's, where hard spine-jarring rides are the norm especially @ the extreme rear end !<br><br>Yes, i agree the B10M's are THE ones to be gotten rid off from here 1st ! Not necessarilly scraped yet but just exported to some more 'sub-standard' country<br>where sub-standard vehicles are more the norm there !! Talk of world class transport here ?!? That will never be so with models like B10M still hanging around ! Even the O 305 has that x-factor touch of class which makes it overall still superior (bus-chassis wise) to the B10M ! B10M as i've said is 'in the middle of nowhere' &amp; is fast becoming an 'irrelevant' model in this day &amp; age.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cool_elf:</div><div class="quote_body">I believe everyone here knows that u r so anti-scania buses.

MK2s are powerful buses but what irates me most is that the air holes keep blowing hot stuffy air! Imagine boarding a semi crowded MK2s on hot afternoon and you'll sweat like mad. That's what I experienced. Really hate it man. Their cousins MK3s have nice bodywork but they are tortoises on roads! There are so many MK4s on the roads and it's quite boring to always board them.<br><br>It's ok to take MK2s once in a while but not everyday!! I'd rather take MBO405s, Scanias or DDs than MK2s! The only Volvo bus that I can tolerate is MK4 DM3500.<br><br>MK2s are powerful but extremely uncomfortable bus to be in! MK2s are more like lorries transporting ppl!<br><br>I prefer those 80's NZMB Volvo B57s to Mk2s! Really missed the former..<br><br></div>
