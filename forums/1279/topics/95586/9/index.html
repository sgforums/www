            <div class='col-md body'>I'm inclined to believe why it seems no new public buses in Singapore lately is because the operators here are thinking of 'jumping' from their current Euro-2 vehicles here to Euro-4 &amp; skipping Euro-3 instead. Anyway, i'm beginning to find it somewhat 'awkward' to see Malaysian operators (they 'supposed' to be more backward than the Singapore ones ?) already using new M-B O 500's with Euro-3 potential while even the big operators in Singapore still stuck @ Euro-2 levels on their buses here.<br><br>I find the relative inefficientcy of CNG buses (to the diesel versions) remains a major deterrent to adopting CNG buses on any large scale. Therefore using Euro-4 diesel instead (of CNG) would still ultimately be THE more practical choice, especially with driving range &amp; fuel utilisation efficientcy &amp; efficacy taken into account. No need to bother with bulky CNG tanks which rob quite some space on the bus ! Overall exhaust emissions still low enough to meet Euro-4 standards &amp; no need to be limited to using only low sulphur diesel, which is still more expensive &amp; less readilly available in this part of the world.<br><br>Of late. i notice in Germany they starting to use the Citaro with Euro-4 diesels.<br>The new Ad-blue fuel additive on these Euro-4 diesel engines sounds an overall more practical space efficient alternative to having 'bulky' CNG buses. The Ad-blue tank is much smaller with only a small quantity needed to add to the diesel fuel &amp; the technology certainly does seem very promising for large scale practical use eventhough costs go up somewhat due to the Ad-blue additive &amp; the supporting infrastructure of Ad-blue refillng stations required to supply to the fleet operators.<br><br>I believe if the big operators here like SBST were to invest a bit in setting up the Ad-blue supply infrastructure here, not only would it serve their own fleet but can also be offered to private commercial operators of buses, coaches or trucks here in future as they also upgrade to Euro-4 &amp; Euro-5 diesels using this Ad-blue additive solution in time to come. With more demand likely lower bulk buying prices of the additive can then be negotiated with the fuel suppliers.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Airbus330Captain:</div><div class="quote_body">SBStransithas ordered 100 new CNG merc OC500LE<br><br>in volgren CR228L bodywork<br>perth<br>and melbounrne assembled<br><br>maybe we cna spot the differences of a perth volgren and a melborune volgren when....the buses arrive in 2005<br><br>the enginner mentioned something abt replacing mark 2s for these new pruchase<br><br>they shall be using CNG to run. most likely go SLBP?<br><br>source dave of perth whose source is engineer of mercedes dealer in..perth<br><br>Source from sgbuses forums. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>again, the AC buses are in better shape than the NAC volvos..<br><br>try taking one NAc mk2 (WA) esp in JIE, and you will see its true colours.. doors can open by itself, the overhead compartments looking like its going to drop off etc etc.. its outside looks liked it just came out from jalan halus<br>to me, the scanias look proper from the outside, no big "cracks" and holes</div>
