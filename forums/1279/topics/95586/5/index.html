Perhaps something with less 'cooling power' due to climate differences?</div></blockquote>A few things...<br><br>The deckers are usually of 2 axles due to how narrow the streets are in London.  Hence they have 11m Darts and 10m Tridents and B7TLs.  Also, because there is no airconditioning, but all buses have heaters.  Heaters are located on one side along the bottom railings under the widnows.  Tjhe Airbus vehicles had airconditioning, and had no rear widnow, and the lower deck saloon is considerably shorter than a standard 2 axle Olympian.  However, the air-conditioning unit is smaller, and it is a Carrier unit.  The unit is small and compact.</div>

It is the equivalent of putting the 1.2L engine from a Lancer into a Tank!  I personally find the build and finish of the Citaros pretty bad...a Custom Coaches CB60 body would be much more suitable, with the lower plastic content.  The suspension is a little harsh, compared to the O.405, but the B12BLE is a vast improvement on previous Volvo air suspension.  Even the Hino RM197K has a tiny 6.8L engine.  The RM230 has a larger engine which sounds like it means business.  the CM has a 13 litre naturally aspirated engine.<br><br>The Citaro's width is some 5mm wider than the standard citybus.  The O.303s with the Mannheim bodies are very nice, and being a firm believe in the V8 engines they produce, I am disappointed at the lack of V8 option in the Australian market for the O.500RF coach chassis.  I am even more disappointed at the lack of hub reduction, although the hypoid rear axle will make a similar (though quieter) whirring noise.</strong>[/quote]</div>

It comes complete with the Citaro badges on the ends, and the interior and seats are from the citaro.  It is also the same as the interior of the fuel-cell citaros, which ARE an integral body and chassis.  All of these demonstrators have the same body, seating arrangements and upholstery.  The windows are by Daimler Chrysler AG.  Like the fuel cell buses, these buses were assembled in Germany (Mannheim, I think) and imported (making full use of the exchange rate between the euro and GBP).  I think the declining quality of these bodies comes with the constant rain, the use of salt on the roads for melting snow, and the bad roads, as well as the usage of aluminium body frames.</div>

Well.. actually.. VO2x and Lo3x.. nothing much different.. they are just 1 or 2 yrs apart only...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
