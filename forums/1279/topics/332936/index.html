              <p>Hi, was just wondering how do they go about putting in the destinations in the EDS ? Does someone type it in manually and saves it in the EDS console in each bus itself or do they type it in a comp and then download it into the all the EDS.</p>
              <p>And where are the EDS console in the new SBST KUBs. It is just above the driver's head on the SMRT's ? And is it linked to the GPS system as I hav never seen the driver change the destination or tinker with it compared wif the SMRT's</p>

              <p>From my knowledge - The earlier buses are using Flip Dot matrix (with mechincal parts or something.) Lighting up of the EDS is done by two flourescent tubes. Will have stuck dot problem when the mechanical part stop putting the pixel up, more common to happen at the route details rather than the route number area from my observation - EDS looks like corrupted.</p>
              <p>The newer buses such as habits uses Flip Dot matrix with individual green (or orange) LED for each dot for lighting up at night. still susceptible to the EDS stuck dot. This individual green LED type EDS is for improved visibility. Still my favourite EDS type so far.</p>
              <p>There's an all LED one if i'm correct...something like the K230UBs? it's all LED bulbs.</p>
              <p>LCD - the tv type is cannot really see - i see reflections instead.</p>
              <p>=\ might have remembered wrong info</p>

              <p>EDS, or Electronic Destination Sign, is coined by TIBS when

              <p>as off_servic estated the offical name to use is Electronci Destination Sign</p>
              <p>the reason for the word destination and NOT display is ebcause buses too have interior LED displays for next bus stops or announcement.<br><br>also EDS replaced roller blinds and plastic destos etc... those show destinations so hence the D is for destination.</p>
              <p>Flip dot technology tends to become rather troubleome as some dots flip and stay to OFF postiion hence a missing dot. Or worse is the dot flips to ON postion n stays On all the time.<br><br>Personally i would think LED normal are more reliuable.<br><br>LCD siaplys can however display much more finer detial and use to display even graphics on the EDS.</p>
              <p>Modern EDS use electricty unlike the ol days of light bulbs. that explains the word Electronic.<br><br>really advanced LED EDS can display up to 4 colours. i beleive LCD EDS can display  in true colour.</p>

              <p>From my knowledge - The earlier buses are using Flip Dot
                  matrix (with mechincal parts or something.) Lighting up of the
                  EDS is done by two flourescent tubes. Will have <strong>stuck dot problem</strong> when the mechanical part stop putting the pixel up,
                  more common to happen at the route details rather
                  than the route number area from my observation - EDS looks
                  like corrupted.</p>
              <p>The newer buses such as habits uses Flip Dot matrix with
                  individual green (or orange) LED for each dot for lighting up
                  at night. still susceptible to the <strong>EDS stuck dot</strong>. This individual
                  green LED type EDS is for improved visibility. Still my favourite
                  EDS type so far.</p>
              <p>There's an all LED one if i'm correct...something like the
                  K230UBs? it's all LED bulbs.</p>
              <p>LCD - the tv type is cannot really see - i see reflections
                  instead.</p>

              <p>Those problems are called dead pixels. Conceptually, they are similar to the dead pixel problems that can occur with your LCD monitors, televisions, etc.; for flip-dot displays, the cause is, as you stated, a jammed mechanical part preventing the dot from flipping properly.</p>
              <p>I have seen a few such flip-dot displays where, after refreshing, some of the dots remain struck in their former position for a moment before flipping over.</p>
              <p>LED displays have their own set of problems. A few years back, I saw SBS 2779A (the Volvo B10M MK IV DM3500 with the LED display - and this was when it was a route 80 bus piror to it becoming the Nokia bus) with it's LED display displaying a flickering mass of garbled nonsense - no route number, details, not even characters that can be made out - just a mess of orange pixels. Not too long ago, I saw a route 86 Scania K230UB displaying a garbled mess on it's LED display too, but at least a few nonsense characters and the route number can be made out.</p>
              <p>I believe it's possible that future bus displays might move away from dot-matrices and towards an emerging display technology: organic light-emitting diode (OLED). These displays are capable of high-resolution like an LCD monitor, emit their own light (LCD displays require the use of backlights, while flip-dot matrix displays require either an external lightning source or an individual LED bulb lighting up each dot), can be "printed" on flexible, curved surfaces, and theortically can be cheaper than LCD displays.Two major hurdles, however, exists: limited life of the organic materials used (blue OLEDs, in particular, last only 14,000 hours), and susceptibility to water damage - both which are especially major problems for use as bus displays.</p>
