However, SBST simply got Comfort drivers to take over the previous SBST drivers and "loaned" the buses to them to run on Turf City routes. Who pays them salary (SBST or Comfort?) i dunno but the driver did mentioned clearly that it is loaned to them, not Comfort taking over that division. In fact, SBST complained that the accident rate is much higher now (every month i see a bus front window being smashed due to accident) cos probably the Comfort drivers are not so accident-prevention-conscious than SBST drivers since they were not driving public scheduled buses with all the guidelines.<br><br>i don't think Comfort vehicles will end up on public scheduled routes soon.. rather, it is most likely SBST is allowing Comfort buses to take over some of its charter operations and taxis can top up fuel there or go for servicing there. it is probably too cumbersome to ask the government for permission to use Comfort vehicles when they r managing its bus fleets' deployment well at the moment.</div>
