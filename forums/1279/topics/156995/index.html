The issue here is that the Government heavily subsides both operators (I think), and therefore, if it became a monopoly (or, as it were, more of a monopoly than it already is), then you still have the same service level, because the government could lose votes should bus services worsen.  If anything, bus services would be competing with the MRT and probably improve instead.

Of course, the companies lose the ability to manage routes and can probably just come up with suggestions.<br><br>What's better if the government subcontract each route to more than 1 company than just say this route goes to this company.

Like that still ok for me. If operated by single operator like that see all the public buses in same livery can be quite sian <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Both companies should try to share ideas on their business tatics if they do not want to merge. Will the government forced them to merge if they do not want to do so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a possible merger.<br><br>think about the famous SPH Mediaworks and Mediacorp.. when Channel U comes, both companies starts bleeding, esp SPH, so in the end, Mediacopr acqusited SPH channel I and U, and SPH gets 40% shares in mediacorp.<br><br>in this scenario, SBS may not even want to takeover SMRT buses, like SMRT not wanting to take over NEL?<br><br>reason: NEL bleeds heavily; SMRT buses has a drastic falling revenue.<br><br>however, Mr Lim Jit Poh, comfortdelgro chairman, is only aiming for EXPANSION of operations, but NOT giving up anything, in this case, NEL.<br><br>why SMRT bus loss revenue, cos nev overseas investments, and few advetisements on buses</div>
