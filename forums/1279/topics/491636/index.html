              <p>Please take the effort to go read the announcement at your bus stops at marine terrace. There is no 155, 160. It is 150 that can take you to Eunos or 134 to Paya Lebar.</p>

              <p>To add on to your points, many of the examples you raised had either <strong>ZERO</strong> or <strong>INCOMPLETE </strong>replacements at all (with regards to 989, lost connections along Jln Kolam Ayer and in CGA). Affected commuters are expected to use other alternatives to get to places served by these withdrawn/shortened services.</p>
              <p>At least the removal of 76 from Marine Parade did see a replacement in the form of sv134, and in another recent example, the lost sectors of 189 in West Coast and KRT entirely replaced with 201.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, this is perfectly normal. Some don't even know after 6 months. There are many people in Punggol who are still ignorant of new bus services sbs 117 and 118 being introduced after few months. Some heard of but don't even bother to know the routes of the new buses. Not everybody is into buses and not everybody is interested. They just want to go home only. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, this is perfectly normal. Some don't even know
                  after 6 months. There are many people in Punggol who are still
                  ignorant of new bus services sbs 117 and 118 being introduced after
                  few months. Some heard of but don't even bother to know the routes
                  of the new buses. Not everybody is into buses and not everybody is
                  interested. They just want to go home only. Cheers.
                  Thanks. </p>

              <p>Confusion is actually just one side of it. The impact is that
                  everyone who used to take 43 and 76 from Marine Parade to places
                  north of Paya Lebar MRT will want to take 43 now instead of taking
                  134 or 150 and transferring to 76, this means increased loads on

              <p>True... they can hang more posters at each bus stop.. and think put more posters in the buses as well.... yes.. there is one staff at paya lebar mrt bus stop, but she is not really doing the job... just stand and see only.... lots of pax are still rushing to board sv76.. the BC have to keep telling buses going eunos only....  </p>
