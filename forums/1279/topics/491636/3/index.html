              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Let's take a good look back in history at the links available
              between Paya Lebar MRT and Marine Parade Rd/Terrace if that's the
              case.</p>
              <p>Since Paya Lebar MRT station opened on 4 November 1989, let's
              start the chronology from Year 1989.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 1989 -
              Year 1992</span></strong></p>
              <p>Only sv135 offered the connection between Paya Lebar MRT and
              Marine Parade Rd when the MRT station first opened. The situation
              was possibly way worse back then than right now. While sv135 do
              have Leyland Atlanteans back then, they were of similar capacity to
              present air-conditioned single-deck buses (approximately 80 pax) to
              cope with the passenger demand, which probably just started
              building up as residents of Marine Parade first started to adapt to
              using Paya Lebar MRT as a transfer point to return home/get to work
              or school.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 1992 -
              Year 2005</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv76 was diverted from Ubi Ave 2, Eunos Link, Jln Eunos, Still
              Rd and Still Rd South to serve Paya Lebar Rd, Tg Katong Rd, Amber
              Rd and Marine Parade Rd (between Amber Rd &amp; Still Rd South) to
              alleviate the passenger demands of sv135. However, air-conditioned
              double-deck buses had yet to be introduced until 1993, which means
              that sv76 could be using the same 80-pax non-air-conditioned
              double-deck buses.</p>
              <p>I wonder if the commuters along Ubi Ave 2 had complained about
              the loss of a direct link to Marine Parade Rd. Eunos Link and Jln
              Eunos didn't have its lost links to Marine Parade Rd replaced for
              about 8 months until the introduction of sv55, while Still Rd and
              Still Rd South remained served by svM4 to Marine Parade Rd, Marine
              Cres and Marine Terrace.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 2005 -
              Year 2016</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv43 was introduced as the third connection between Paya Lebar
              MRT and Marine Parade Rd to help out sv76 and sv135, which also
              resulted in its extensive duplication with sv76. Operating with a
              full fleet of B10Ms, double-deck buses were only introduced on sv43
              from 2012, which meant that sv76 was the only service with
              air-conditioned double-deck buses of the three connections along
              this sector for about 7 years after sv43 was first introduced. The
              Marine Cres/Terrace connection was only offered from 2011.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 2016 -
              Present</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv134 was introduced as a replacement connection for sv76, which
              was diverted to Eunos Int. sv43 was marked as "the alternative"
              with albeit poorer frequencies, while sv134 itself, as with a few
              other BSEP services, also had erratic frequencies. Commuters were
              confused with the changes between sv76 and sv134 as the goodwill
              ambassador deployed was not conscientious in informing commuters of
              the changes and the BCs had to be the ones keeping the commuters
              informed.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
              Verdict</span></strong></p>
              <p>Which era was the worst? 1989-1992, 1992-2005, 2005-2016 or
              right now?</p>

              <p>Some case with 47 - time lag between svc intro and route information panels. Had to contend with tiny cryptic posters at the bus stop for the time being. But it wasn't so bad because it did not involve route amendements. </p>
              <p>There should have been banners at Paya Lebar MRT. And I think they should have gone as far as making announcements in the MRT station: "Service 76 has been amended to terminate at Eunos Interchange. Passengers going to Tanjong Katong Rd, Amber Rd, Marine Parade Rd, may use services 43, 134 and 135. Passengers going to Marine Cres and Marine Terrace, please use service 134." </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, if you read the post carefully, he is not suggesting to trim smrt966. He is merely telling people to consider carefully before everybody keeps suggesting to cut routes. </p>
              <p>Moreover there is nothing for you to worry. The authorities are not likely to cut routes without providing an alternative service. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I feel like falling off my chair and laughing. Of course it can be cut. Most demand is not from BPJ or Woodlands to Marine Parade. Why would Woodlanders be going to Marine Parade? To use Parkway Parade and Marine Parade CC, because they don't have their own facilities? To attend school? Or to enjoy sea breeze? </p>
              <p>It's ridiculous that people in the far north have direct access to Marine Parade when neighbouring estates that rely on facilities in Marine Parade have zero or lauzy connections to the area. Please tell me how Kembangan, Chai Chee or Bedok North would get to Marine Parade? 134 was the correct thing to do. People in Sims Place rightfully deserved a connection to Marine Parade over their counterparts in AMK. </p>
