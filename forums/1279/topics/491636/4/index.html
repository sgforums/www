              <p>So just because your area lacks a direct bus to Marine Parade, you want to rid of other existing connections from other areas to Marine Parade. Isn't that like if you do not have something, you expect others not to have that something as well?</p>
              <p>For 76, there are several alternatives (including the new 134) to justify its cutback to Eunos, even though I agree that the relability of the alternative buses needs to be stepped up and the publicity over the cutback needs to be better promoted. In addition, 76 also isn't exactly the fastest way to travel between Ang Mo Kio New Town and Marine Parade and probably wouldn't be as well-utilized along that stretch. I do not fully buy the benefit of the cutback in improving overall service efficiency, but it's not the worst cutback we've seen.</p>
              <p>However, for 966, it is a relatively fast route compared to taking the MRT to travel between Woodlands, Bukit Panjang and Marine Parade (60-90 mins) by using the BKE and PIE. In addition, there is almost no heavily duplicating alternative service to 966.</p>
              <p>In this case, it isn't about the residents of Woodlands and Bukit Panjang going to Marine Parade to use the facilities in Marine Parade. If not, why do we bother having Services 39, 85, 117, 161, 168, 858 and 969? By your logic, it's not like the residents residing in the East (Pasir Ris, Tampines &amp; Bedok) or Northeast (Hougang, Sengkang &amp; Punggol) needs to rely on the facilities in the North (Woodlands, Sembawang &amp; Yishun) and vice versa right? The thing here is there are people residing in one part of Singapore that are required to work or study in places in another part of Singapore, which is why the above bus services even exist in the first place.</p>
              <p>If what you are bothered about is the lack of a connection between Kembangan/Chai Chee/Bedok North and Marine Parade, we should be addressing that shortage instead and not wanting other connections eradicated. By eradicating 966 from Marine Parade, will there suddenly be an additional bus between the above 3 places and Marine Parade? (unless you amend 966 to those three places first and then Marine Parade then that's a different story)</p>
              <p>If not, we might as well just have ONE bus service in every residential town or area that everyone will rely on to get to the nearest MRT station. Why bother having trunk services in the first place regardless of route length? Let's redesign Singapore's public bus network to just have short feeder services that link to the nearest MRT stations and force all commuters to use the rail network only for long distance travelling.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6465E, that is why people are discussing that time. Far flung towns have direct linkage to marine parade when nearby towns do not have direct buses to marine parade area. That is the whole irony. This is due to the yr 1990s era of town planning where many far towns are connected directly by public buses. However in yr 2010s era, the paradigm shifts to short haul routes where nearby towns are connected in preference to last time. To shift away completely from the old theory takes years and expects lots of resistance. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Yes, if not then why would LTA cut 76 back? </p>
              <p>I am a Marine Parade resident, and have ridden these services
              and can vouch for the fact that this is the case for 76 as well as
              for 966 where most of the demand is from PP to Eunos (or at most
              Toa Payoh/CJC). I cannot give you any hard data, but as a private
              citizen I can make arguments based on day-to-day experiences living
              in the area. Like, people here depend on Marine Parade for basic
              facilities (i.e. shopping, marketing, schools etc). Why would
              somebody in AMK go all the way to Parkway Parade when they can go
              AMK hub? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">For schools in the
              area, you might find some. </span></p>
              <p>Similarly for Woodlands? Ok, I'll give it to you that you have
              students studying in RP or NSFs who go to army camps in BPJ and
              Woodlands.  </p>
              <p>So, instead of telling me there is demand, can you at least tell
              me why there would be demand from AMK/Woodlands to MP and
              vice-versa. I don't expect there to be data. If you have data, then
              please share it here. </p>

              <p>Lets say that I am a resident of Woodlands and I am a TP student. I cant possibly change my poly course because that is the only course available there and I want to pursue my dreams. There is 168 which goes there and it is 7am. My class is at 8am and I dont want to waste time getting there. If I were to take the MRT via CCL &amp; EWL, I will be late due to the number of lines of take. I dont even want to take 23 to TP from Tampines as I would wasting my money &amp; time when 168 is very direct and takes at most 45 minutes even with expressway jams. Most students from TP are actually from the North. Thats why 118 is very crowded as it also runs on TPE. People just want to go home fast after work as they are obviously tired. Even if the MRT is fast, we cannot rely too much on it as more people are taking it which means increasing chances of breakdowns. If you are talking about long-winded services like 167 &amp; 980, thats another story.

Dont forget that buses are supposed to serve areas not served by the MRT like Oxley BizHub at Tai Seng where there is a significant number of workers working there. Thats why you will see buses like 8 &amp; 24 which transport them back to their homes instead of walking to Tai Seng MRT from there which is generally far (distance)</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6465E, that is why people are discussing that time. Far
              flung towns have direct linkage to marine parade when nearby towns
              do not have direct buses to marine parade area. That is the whole
              irony. This is due to the yr 1990s era of town planning where many
              far towns are connected directly by public buses. However in yr
              2010s era, the paradigm shifts to short haul routes where nearby
              towns are connected in preference to last time. To shift away
              completely from the old theory takes years and expects lots of
              resistance. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>So just because your area lacks a direct bus to Marine Parade,
              you want to rid of other existing connections from other areas to
              Marine Parade. Isn't that like if you do not have something, you
              expect others not to have that something as well?</p>
              <p>For 76, there are several alternatives (including the new 134)
              to justify its cutback to Eunos, even though I agree that the
              relability of the alternative buses needs to be stepped up and the
              publicity over the cutback needs to be better promoted. In
              addition, 76 also isn't exactly the fastest way to travel between
              Ang Mo Kio New Town and Marine Parade and probably wouldn't be as
              well-utilized along that stretch. I do not fully buy the benefit of
              the cutback in improving overall service efficiency, but it's not
              the worst cutback we've seen.</p>
              <p>However, for 966, it is a relatively fast route compared to
              taking the MRT to travel between Woodlands, Bukit Panjang and
              Marine Parade (60-90 mins) by using the BKE and PIE. In addition,
              there is almost no heavily duplicating alternative service to
              966.</p>
              <p>In this case, it isn't about the residents of Woodlands and
              Bukit Panjang going to Marine Parade to use the facilities in
              Marine Parade. If not, why do we bother having Services 39, 85,
              117, 161, 168, 858 and 969? By your logic, it's not like the
              residents residing in the East (Pasir Ris, Tampines &amp; Bedok) or
              Northeast (Hougang, Sengkang &amp; Punggol) needs to rely on the
              facilities in the North (Woodlands, Sembawang &amp; Yishun) and
              vice versa right? The thing here is there are people residing in
              one part of Singapore that are required to work or study in places
              in another part of Singapore, which is why the above bus services
              even exist in the first place.</p>
              <p>If what you are bothered about is the lack of a connection
              between Kembangan/Chai Chee/Bedok North and Marine Parade, we
              should be addressing that shortage instead and not wanting other
              connections eradicated. By eradicating 966 from Marine Parade, will
              there suddenly be an additional bus between the above 3 places and
              Marine Parade? (unless you amend 966 to those three places first
              and then Marine Parade then that's a different story)</p>
              <p>If not, we might as well just have ONE bus service in every
              residential town or area that everyone will rely on to get to the
              nearest MRT station. Why bother having trunk services in the first
              place regardless of route length? Let's redesign Singapore's public
              bus network to just have short feeder services that link to the
              nearest MRT stations and force all commuters to use the rail
              network only for long distance travelling.</p>

In these cases you have Changi Airport, Tampines, CBP, Seletar etc as major employment centres that feed into these routes. The same cannot be said of Marine Parade. There's nothing wrong with having a direct link to Woodlands - there are people with genuine travel needs. But the problem in Marine Parade is that there are too many services and thus LTA is reluctant to introduce new services. Yet, the area is actually very poorly connected to neighbouring estates. So, something needs to go. It's time to re-examine some of these longer routes that don't make sense. </span></p>

              <p>Bet you have NEVER taken 966 before. If you havent then stfu. </p>
              <p>966 usually is at least fully seated on the express. It remains this way until Eunos Link, where 5-10 pax alight. At Eunos MRT even less will alight.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The HUGE bulk alight at MP. A place with no MRT and no alternatives as 7557R have correctly pointed out, it is the artery for northern residents as it provides the most direct (literally, even as the crow flies) and fastest link to MP. </span></p>
              <p>I should be the one falling off the chair and laughing at you for being so ignorant to the surroundings of MP. Let's forget about the one and only famous East Coast Park and also one of the largest mall in SG being there first, many people work at the offices in PP itself and the countless agencies in the shophouses at Katong. It is home to some of the renowned schools in Singapore: VJ, KC (not holding), Tao Nan to list a few. Yes, ppl in the north do not have these "good" schs back there. So foolish of you to ignore this bunch?</p>
              <p>What do you actually mean by being "poorly connected to surrounding estates"? What are you treating svcs 15, 31, 43 as?! These svcs amongst some others in MP provide a intratown network so dense one simply couldnt have asked for more. You want personal chauffeur svc to ur doorstep?</p>
              <p>Going by your line of logic I could name a dozen svcs that couldve been cut too. For eg, I can cut svc 853C since nobody would go to MP from Yishun anyways. In fact, any svc would have been cuttable since the other end " wouldnt come all the way here". Why 966? You hate it a lot?</p>
              <p>So why not I cut 48 too? Anyways there is still 197 to bugis and not many ppl go to KK in the first place, leave alone everyday. And c'mon, who the fuck even goes to Buona Vista?</p>

              <p>Bet you have NEVER taken 966 before. If you havent then
                      stfu. </p>
              <p>966 usually is at least fully seated on the express. It remains
                      this way until Eunos Link, where 5-10 pax alight. At Eunos MRT even
                      less will alight.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The HUGE bulk alight at MP. A
                      place with no MRT and no alternatives as 7557R have correctly
                      pointed out, it is the artery for northern residents as it provides
                      the most direct (literally, even as the crow flies) and fastest
                      link to MP. </span></p>
              <p>I should be the one falling off the chair and laughing at you
                      for being so ignorant to the surroundings of MP. Let's forget about
                      the one and only famous East Coast Park and also one of the largest
                      mall in SG being there first, many people work at the offices in PP
                      itself and the countless agencies in the shophouses at Katong. It
                      is home to some of the renowned schools in Singapore: VJ, KC (not
                      holding), Tao Nan to list a few. Yes, ppl in the north do not have
                      these "good" schs back there. So foolish of you to ignore this
                      bunch?</p>
              <p>What do you actually mean by being "poorly connected to
                      surrounding estates"? What are you treating svcs 15, 31, 43 as?!
                      These svcs amongst some others in MP provide a intratown network so
                      dense one simply couldnt have asked for more. You want personal
                      chauffeur svc to ur doorstep?</p>
              <p>Going by your line of logic I could name a dozen svcs that
                      couldve been cut too. For eg, I can cut svc 853C since nobody would
                      go to MP from Yishun anyways. In fact, any svc would have been
                      cuttable since the other end " wouldnt come all the way here". Why
                      966? You hate it a lot?</p>
              <p>So why not I cut 48 too? Anyways there is still 197 to bugis and
                      not many ppl go to KK in the first place, leave alone everyday. And
                      c'mon, who the fuck even goes to Buona Vista?</p>

              <p>I have ridden 966 on various occassionsa nd never said the majority of riders alight at Eunos. But the majority of demand to Marine Parade is from Toa Payoh (faster than 31), Kallang Industrial Estate, and Eunos. </p>
              <p>Yes, there is some demand from Woodlands, but you are overstating it. PP is a regional mall, and definitely not that different from what you'd find in the far North or in nearby areas. There cetainly are offices in Katong, and in PP/Parkway Central, but it's not a major employment centre. As for schools, I can attest to the fact that students who live in BPJ/Woodlands are a very very small minority (used to teach in these schools). Why would they come out here, when you have schools like NJC, SJI etc that all much closer. And the logic is just warped... A much larger majority of students live in Kembangan, Bedok North or Chai Chee. And these students don't have direct access. </p>
              <p>Take Kembangan for instance. Say you stay in Lengkong Empat and study in Victoria School. There is no viable way of reaching school by public transport. For Chai Chee, it's a very roundabout way of taking 222 to Bedok Interchange and then transfering.</p>
              <p>And don't put words into my mouth. I said 966 can possibly be cut. I didn't say it had to be 966. CBD services can't be cut because the area has no MRT. But go and suggest a route from Eunos to Kembangan/Chai Chee via Marine Parade. I've done it before and LTA will say cannot because there will be too much duplication with 15 &amp; 966 that connect Eunos to PP. So do you understand how a Woodlands service can impede improvements to the network in the area? That was why LTA had to cut back 76, because 134 is essentially a duplicate of 76. </p>

              <p>You very clearly don't live here. Yes, intratown within Marine Parade is good, but inter-town to Siglap, Kembangan, Chai Chee, Bedok North, don't have. Sims Place and Geylang East Central were recently added. The problem is the network is too dense in going to places like Bedok, Paya Lebar, Tanah Merah and Kallang, etc. </p>

              <p>To put things in another persective. 966 is the ONLY svc in the ENTIRE north/northwest district that provides a 7-days-a-week connection to MP. We are not even talking about direct bus connection here. Many in the north actually transfer to 966 to get to MP. The svc is that popular. We are not even talking about 966 serving an estate, or even a town. That SOLE svc serves <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">AN ENTIRE DISTRICT</span></strong>. Compare that to the east, where you have a svc to almost EVERY EWL station on the eastern stretch. Give you MULTIPLE options to get to a town in the east you dont want. Now you want a chauffeur svc to doorstep then you happy? Now you want to axe the lifeline for the whole of the north, just to benefit the measly dozens that live in that few estates? What bloody logic is this!</p>
              <p>I really don't know if you are the one ignorant or I am the one. I have a friend who used to study in a sec school in Clementi, choosing to opt for a junior college in the east. I'm sure there are many others too. JAE is a cruel process and many students often have to forsake travelling time to attend the next best alternative that they are left with. </p>
              <p>Regarding your suggestion about MP - CC. In the first place, have you reflected on the route that you have proposed? Couldn't you have suggested another routing that would have prevented the duplication? And cutting routes isn't that easy. It involves cost-benefit measurement, and no just blindly cutting. 76 was cut as it was clear that it really is a minority for passengers to warm their seats for almost an hour from AMK to get to PP. The same is definitely not true for 966. </p>

              There cetainly are offices in Katong, and in PP/Parkway Central,

              attest to the fact that students who live in BPJ/Woodlands are a
              very very small minority (used to teach in these schools). Why
              would they come out here, when you have schools like NJC, SJI etc
              that all much closer. And the logic is just warped... A much larger
              majority of students live in Kembangan, Bedok North or Chai Chee.

              taking 222 to Bedok Interchange and then transfering.</p>
              <p>And don't put words into my mouth. I said 966 can possibly be
              cut. I didn't say it had to be 966. CBD services can't be cut
              because the area has no MRT. But go and suggest a route from Eunos
              to Kembangan/Chai Chee via Marine Parade. I've done it before and
              LTA will say cannot because there will be too much duplication with
              15 &amp; 966 that connect Eunos to PP. So do you understand how a
              Woodlands service can impede improvements to the network in the

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">For the queries about a lack of connection between Bedok North and Marine Parade, I do not exactly understand your concerns. Isn't Bedok Int located in Bedok North? Aren't there already <strong>FOUR</strong> bus services all this while (16 and its predecessor CSS 608, 31, 196 &amp; 197 and its predecessor 41) that provides the connections? Even if a good number of residential blocks in Bedok North are located slightly further away from Bedok Bus Interchange, it is usually just <strong>ONE</strong> transfer away. Moreover, 31 also serves several parts of Bedok North beyond the bus interchange even if 16, 196 and 197 doesn't do so. If the "Bedok North" you're referring to is Bedok Reservoir, 15 is there for the eastern part of Bedok Reservoir.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Are you proposing a bus service that starts from either Bedok Int or Bedok North Depot that takes a long detour around the more secluded neighbourhoods of Bedok North and then looping at Marine Parade, or is it a service that starts from a secluded part of Bedok North (e.g. Bedok North St 3) that directly links to Marine Parade? A service from Bedok Int to Marine Parade via Bedok North would probably not be viable, but maybe a BNDEP - Marine Parade via Bedok North service is possible. As array88 mentioned, CBP - Marine Parade via Bedok North is not viable either, given that there's already 47.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">With regards to Chai Chee, maybe we could have either 1 of the 3 terminating services follow 229 to Bedok South Rd. However, that would be considered long winded by other users here. Or like I said before, let's bring back the good old Chai Chee Bus Terminal, which 41 once terminated at and linked <strong>DIRECTLY</strong> to Marine Parade. To correct your post regarding Chai Chee, the connections between Chai Chee and Bedok is also served by 229, and people who take 222 will not take it all the way to Bedok Int, but alight at New Upp Changi Rd instead. The walk from New Upp Changi Rd to Bedok Int wouldn't even take very long and you have another option to use the underpass to transfer to 31 at the opposite bus stop.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Siglap does have 401 to connect to Marine Parade during the weekends and public holidays. Maybe introduce a 401M (like some users suggested here) on weekdays to exclusively connect between Siglap and Marine Parade?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">A direct connection between Kembangan and Marine Parade is justifiable if there is sufficient passenger demand. However, all three areas (Kembangan, Siglap &amp; Bedok North), like SMB128B said, are clearly closer to Bedok Town Centre. Wouldn't it make more sense for the residents in these areas to go to Bedok Town Centre for the "basic facilities" that you mentioned?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">If it's for students getting to school, it is understandably a different situation. However, would the operating hours as a result have to be tweaked to just peak hour operation like 181M, 900A and 902 if the bulk of the passenger demand for your proposed connections are students? If the demographics of the passenger demand for the proposed services are homogenous, then of course a full day route is best.</p>

              the problem in Marine Parade is that there are too many services
              and thus LTA is reluctant to introduce new services. Yet, the area
              is actually very poorly connected to neighbouring estates. So,

              <p>the goal was never 1000 to begin with, it was 600 as LTA has mentioned that only 500 commuters would be affected by amendments at information panels at the bus carnival. The website only allows us to place 1000 as a minimum. Thus we have exceeded our expectations by 378 signatures. Also, we are still consulting relevant authorities to help attain our direct link back. Hope you understand. Cheers.</p>
