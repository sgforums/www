              <p>How did 76 get major downsize when only 2 buses removed for route getting cut. That too the buses removed were SDs. So now 76 has 13 DDs and 2 SDs instead of earlier 13 DDs and 4 SDs.</p>
              <p>How is 134 a downgrade? When now you have 5 DDs and 2 SDs. Yet majority DD fleet. 134 comes at a timely manner to Paya Lebar towards Marine Terrace.

              <p>Best would have been to extend 76 to Eunos via Still road and ply Marine Terrace bi-directional. No need for 134 or 150. </p>
              <p>Surprised no one is talking about 150 that is faring so poorly. &lt;10 pax on every bus. Few buses during peak 10-20 pax. More so if 155 come, 150 can go with 0 pax all the way. </p>

              <p>How did 76 get major downsize when only 2 buses removed for
              route getting cut. That too the buses removed were SDs. So now 76

              <p>How is 134 a downgrade? When now you have 5 DDs and 2 SDs. Yet
              majority DD fleet. 134 comes at a timely manner to Paya Lebar
              towards Marine Terrace. On return journey it could get delayed.
              Everyone is still missing the point. If 134 can get delayed inspite
              of its short route along Parkway/Tanjong Katong, then what would

              <p>sv134 should also terminate at Marine Terrace, so as to improve its reliability mah.. further, the delay that i have show is at 1122am and 1pm... NOT PEAK HOUR.... further, </p>

              <p>true, LTA should have manage it better... they should not have amended sv76 now... they can wait for around 3 months after sv134 have been introduced to do the amendment....  and annouce the amendment of sv76 at same time as introduction of sv134... </p>
              <p>it is funny that in one of the display at the bus carnival, LTA put that they are informing paxes well in advance of any new routes and amendment.... 1-2 weeks are not WELL in advance.......</p>
              <p>sv134 buses should get full body ads, putting route details (such as NEW SERVICE 134 from Sims Drive to Marine Parade)... bus stops should have more informations as well. that paya lebar station bus stop bus arrival time panel does not have sv134 arrival time as of last friday....and in IRIS/LTA app, no WAB details are show also..</p>

The only way to counteract this type of change is for you to take the deep plunge and get into LTA and join the planning group. Other than this, what we suggest here are just absorbing the after effects. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Let's take a good look back in history at the links available between Paya Lebar MRT and Marine Parade Rd/Terrace if that's the case.</p>
              <p>Since Paya Lebar MRT station opened on 4 November 1989, let's start the chronology from Year 1989.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 1989 - Year 1992</span></strong></p>
              <p>Only sv135 offered the connection between Paya Lebar MRT and Marine Parade Rd when the MRT station first opened. The situation was possibly way worse back then than right now. While sv135 do have Leyland Atlanteans back then, they were of similar capacity to present air-conditioned single-deck buses (approximately 80 pax) to cope with the passenger demand, which probably just started building up as residents of Marine Parade first started to adapt to using Paya Lebar MRT as a transfer point to return home/get to work or school.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 1992 - Year 2005</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv76 was diverted from Ubi Ave 2, Eunos Link, Jln Eunos, Still Rd and Still Rd South to serve Paya Lebar Rd, Tg Katong Rd, Amber Rd and Marine Parade Rd (between Amber Rd &amp; Still Rd South) to alleviate the passenger demands of sv135. However, air-conditioned double-deck buses had yet to be introduced until 1993, which means that sv76 could be using the same 80-pax non-air-conditioned double-deck buses.</p>
              <p>I wonder if the commuters along Ubi Ave 2 had complained about the loss of a direct link to Marine Parade Rd. Eunos Link and Jln Eunos didn't have its lost links to Marine Parade Rd replaced for about 8 months until the introduction of sv55, while Still Rd and Still Rd South remained served by svM4 to Marine Parade Rd, Marine Cres and Marine Terrace.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 2005 - Year 2016</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv43 was introduced as the third connection between Paya Lebar MRT and Marine Parade Rd to help out sv76 and sv135, which also resulted in its extensive duplication with sv76. Operating with a full fleet of B10Ms, double-deck buses were only introduced on sv43 from 2012, which meant that sv76 was the only service with air-conditioned double-deck buses of the three connections along this sector for about 7 years after sv43 was first introduced. The Marine Cres/Terrace connection was only offered from 2011.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Year 2016 - Present</span></strong></p>
              <p>sv134 was introduced as a replacement connection for sv76, which was diverted to Eunos Int. sv43 was marked as "the alternative" with albeit poorer frequencies, while sv134 itself, as with a few other BSEP services, also had erratic frequencies. Commuters were confused with the changes between sv76 and sv134 as the goodwill ambassador deployed was not conscientious in informing commuters of the changes and the BCs had to be the ones keeping the commuters informed.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Verdict</span></strong></p>
              <p>Which era was the worst? 1989-1992, 1992-2005, 2005-2016 or right now?</p>

              already made the endorsement when he went into LTA few years ago
              and studied the plans for change. The only way to counteract this
              type of change is for you to take the deep plunge and get into LTA
              and join the planning group. Other than this, what we suggest here
              are just absorbing the after effects. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
