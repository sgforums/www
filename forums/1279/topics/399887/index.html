              <p>Okay, so let me start here.<br>My friend is working on a project which requires pictures of hazardous substance signage - e.g. the kind you see on petrochemical-ferrying lorries.</p>
              <p><br>Now, I know that this is highly unrelated to buses, but then some of you may have an interest in trucks as well.</p>
              <p>If you happen to have high-resolution photos of these chemical trucks, petrol tankers, and said signage in general, please let me know.</p>
              <p>I am requesting for your permission for your photos to be used as part of the project work.</p>
              <p>Of course, you can say that I could take a bus home from school everyday and try my luck. But I cannot do that due to the following reasons.</p>
              <p>1) MRT is much more efficient in my case. From my polytechnic back to where I live, it is a roughly one hour and forty minute ride. Even longer, actually. If I do this everyday  I really have no time for my homework, etc.</p>
              <p>2) What are the chances I'll see a truck with these symbols? What are the chances I'll get a proper pic? (Note: proper. Not asking for uber-clear pictures.) With my lacklustre phone camera, hmm, not possible. And no, DSLR isn't an option. I'm banned from bringing it to school. Don't ask.</p>
              <p>3) That is gonna cost me a hell lot. No, I don't have BCP. For the very simple reason that I will rarely need to take a bus for now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And no, pictures off the Internet are not allowed. Apparently the teacher is intelligent enough to know that the signages are near the license plates, and hence, license plate must be photographed along with said signage. Side shots allowed to, but there must be a few front/rear shots present to prove that this is in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I may be being a little difficult here, but let me beforehand thank all of you for contributing to this project in any way. Please help a fellow forumer out by doing this. I don't want to disappoint the guy as he is a close friend of mine, and has helped me out numerous times in the past.</p>
              <p>So please do help me by donating me some pictures, if you have them.</p>
              <p>Thank you :)</p>

              <p>For petrol tankers, they are pretty common in petrol kiosks. For Shell, it is normally the Renault and Mercedes Benz trucks. For ExxonMobil, normally Scanias. For SPC, will be Volvos FH16 or Mercedes Benz, if I remembered correctly.</p>
              <p>For chemical ferrying trucks, the best place to look out for them will be Jurong Industrial Estate. There are tons of trucks moving along the main roads of the industrial estate.

              <p>There are plenty of such vehicles on the roads leading up to Jurong Island, and at the Jurong Industrial Area.</p>
              <p>Due to heightened security, you should use some common sense and not take near the checkpoint area. Plates should be for your teacher's eyes only.</p>
              <p>If you like to have Malaysia versions, Kranji and the road leading up the Checkpoint has trucks queuing up on peak periods.</p>
