              <p>Aiya... Still want standardise when THEY PRC THEMSELVES dun even standardise their own f***ing disciples of humanity... Beating up dogs, unfair government, cruelty, plagiarism and the list goes on... What f***ing right do they, the underworld DOGS hv to standardise when they are not even human at all???!!!! Since you are dogs, u had btr not eat your fellow friends too... Whenever I hear or see anything related to PRC in Singapre I would really want to punch the PRC guy (or also can be known as a dog)in his (or its) motherf***ing face or scribble in the government signboards whenever there are Chinese slangs there and stuff... Singapre is really starting to become dogs too in that case!!!</p>
              <p>I rmb got one time, when I watching channel 5 movie, the Chinese subs that came in wrote: "è¯´<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">å•¥</strong>?" (Originally "pardon?") I really feel like slamming the television and complaining man! Abt how PRC dogs were treated better by our dog-lover government, and how they have 100% CHINESE ads in our ENGLISH channels man!!!!!!!! F*** u mediacorp!!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, Singapore had btr not become PRC, otherwise I will make sure to cancel singapore citizenship!!! PRC Don't ruin my country's name I warn u!!!</p>
              <p>P.S. I cannot f***ing believe how PRC dog STILL hv the face to come to Singapore and make singapore standardised when back in their dog society, a UNIVERSITY GRADUATE called Singapore a piece of shit.</p>

              <p><strong>Hengtong Bus Debut in Singapore and be Well Positioned for Oversea Market </strong><br> Author:China Auto &amp; Parts   Source: China Auto &amp; Parts   Time:2012-4-5 13:52:13 <br> <br> <br> On March 17th 2012, the release conference of Hengtong Bus hosted by SCA
               was held in Singapore. About 300 guests attended the conference and cut
               the ribbon for the new models, including Chen Shaoquan, general manager
               of SCA, Shen Jinlong, manager of the machinery department of ITOCHU 
              Singapore Pte. Ltd, Hu Yu, general manager of Huaguan International 
              Industrial Equipment (CCIE), Tang Qiandong, vice president and party 
              secretary of Hengtong Bus, general engineer Wan Chang, regional client 
              representatives from Singapore and friends from media such as Singapore 
              Lianhe Zaobao and Straits Daily. This conference demonstrates that 
              Hengtong is officially entering the high-end market overseas, which 
              makes Hengtong one of the few manufacturers that are selling 
              domestically made buses to the market of developed countries. <br> <br> <strong>Entering the Singapore market with SCA</strong><br> <br> SCA is one of the top 50 enterprises in Singapore, which is generally 
              acknowledged as the most trustworthy coach and bust manufacturer by the 
              local industry. SCA is dedicated in R&amp;D and innovation, holding the 
              palm in designing and manufacturing ordinary buses and sightseeing buses
               for many years. <br> <br> Hengtong was set up in 1939, which is one of the largest bus 
              manufacturers in China. It is also one of the top ten bus makers with an
               annual production of 10,000 large buses. It has been constantly 
              improving its professional abilities in manufacturing buses. Hengtong is
               in the leading position in the Chinese bus industry in terms of 
              R&amp;D, manufacturing and management. Its products are sold to 23 
              countries and regions such as Thailand, Peru, Syria and Malawi. It 
              enjoys high brand recognition and reputation all over the world. <br> <br> The official release of Hengtong’s buses in Singapore makes the 
              respective advantages of Hengtong and SCA complementary to each other, 
              demonstrating the first achievement made by Hengtong and SCA cooperating
               with each other. It is also the beginning of the new journey Hengtong 
              is making towards the Singapore bus market. <br> <br> <strong>Customization makes perfect</strong><br> <br> Since the study group led by Chen Shaoquan, general manager of SCA paid a
               visit to Hengtong in August 2010, Hengtong has been making deep 
              analysis and research on the situations such as road, passenger flow and
               tourism of the Singapore market with more than a year’s communication 
              and exchange with SCA. After the targeted R&amp;D of new models, 
              Hengtong suggests SCA adopt CKZ6920CHB4 of its Xianglong family which is
               feasible and suitable for the actual conditions of Singapore. <br> <br> In September 2011, SCA signed a purchase agreement of 20 CKZ6920CHB4 
              with Hengtong. The released new model on the conference is the first 
              high-quality bus in the agreement, which is customized according to the 
              actual situation of Singapore by Hengtong. The body is elegantly and 
              beautifully designed. The framework and skin of the body are made of 
              two-sided galvanized materials, which greatly improve the corrosion 
              resistant ability of the body to combat the humid oceanic climate in 
              Singapore. The professional chassis is matched with the imported Cummins
               Euro IV diesel engine, which greatly reduces the operational cost due 
              to its strong carrying capacity and features of energy conservation and 
              environment protection. The seats are designed according to the body 
              features of the Singaporeans, of which the comfortableness is improved. 
              The luggage rack, LED TV and DVD equipped are simple and practical, 
              forming a more comfortable environment for passengers. <br> <br> After the release conference, people attended the conference paid a 
              visit to Hengtong Bus accompanied by Mr. Tang. They were giving high 
              appreciation to the perfect shape, human-oriented design and delicate 
              craft of the new model. Attendees of the conference were also very 
              interested in the new model, and many of them even registered right at 
              the conference to give a test try. <br> <br> At last, Mr. Tang said that Hengtong, as the globally recognized expert 
              in public transportation solution, will set up after-sale service 
              stations with SCA in Singapore under the principle of taking social 
              responsibilities and providing perfect services for customers during and
               after purchase. He believes there will be more and more Hengtong buses 
              running on the roads of Singapore, providing safe, environment friendly,
               comfortable and convenient services for the Singaporean people.</p>

              <p>Makes sense. They could be sending a demo to SBST since its painted in SBST colours. But not this one with Hengtong logo.</p>

              <p>Then Hengtongs will be as common as Scanias. And I wonder what will happen to user SMB228X if that happens.</p>
