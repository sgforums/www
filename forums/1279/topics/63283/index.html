If you cannot spot it, perhaps the bus is under maintainence or SBST has other plans for the bus, like going to another service. You can try spotting at New Bridge Road at 6.45pm (1845 hr). The bus usually will be there.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">The Mercedes Volgren O405G is still on service 18. Lately the bus is in operation very often, you can almost see the bus for the past few weeks throughout operations hours. Therefore, I believed there might be a buyer for it already as Singapore bus operators always uses the bus to the max when it is going off.</span></div>

They were converted to air-con buses after the introduction of TV Mobile and if "it's a lesson learnt" as you say, why did they still install TVMobile on these buses?</div>

If you cannot spot it, perhaps the bus is under maintainence or SBST has other plans for the bus, like going to another service. You can try spotting at New Bridge Road at 6.45pm (1845 hr). The bus usually will be there.</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">The Mercedes Volgren O405G is still on service 18. Lately the bus is in operation very often, you can almost see the bus for the past few weeks throughout operations hours. Therefore, I believed there might be a buyer for it already as Singapore bus operators always uses the bus to the max when it is going off.</span></div></blockquote>This particular bus is painted with the carrier man aircon advertisement rite??

However, I cannot confirm if this is true as the buses are still available for sale on their website.</div>
