              <p>There's a distinction between gear change and lock-up when there's an abrupt drop in rpm.<br><br>
              For the latter, I know some buses tend to lock-up too early and this means it has to lock-up again. This is due to a faulty setting, and fits the description you have described, which is, it fails half the time. They did not move on to the second gear but tried to rev again at first gear once more.
              <br><br>
              For the former, the pitch of the engine will be entirely different (though it may sound minimal to most people) when it's at second gear, and the rpm drop is actually not as abrupt as a faulty lock-up.
              <br><br>
              Most ZF gearboxes will, when it had cleared the first gear then dropped back to second gear and wishes to accelerate, lock-up at the second gear. This lock-up will sound like it is dragging and will take longer. The ones which will occasionally jump back to first gear and rev up again are usually LO3x's and 6HP's on B9TL and KUB. A small number of Striders do that too.
              <br><br>
              Maybe you can give me the regos of the VO3x's next time then I'll visit the buses. (:</p>

              <p><br>Honestly I can't tell much from that clip....not to say that the quality sucked, but I have to be there to experience it haha.</p>
              <p>Initially I thought that for such VOs the lock-up is too early. But now I think back, these buses are closer to the Lance, MKIV etc etc than 9208K. These buses change to 2nd at fairly low rpm, then attempt to pull through 2nd at even lower rpms and then struggle to proceed to lock-up at 2nd. Obviously there's a reason why the VOs are usually made to lock-up at 1st and at fairly high rpms, because half the time you get a kick in your butt when the bus switches back to 1st.</p>
              <p>In that clip however, I have no inkling of where's the lock-up, so honestly I can't say much about it. If you're looking for the above mentioned buses, I would say it is more likely to occur in the batch 3 types. Some I remember include 9630Z, 9638C. Light pressure on the pedal would induce that effect on these buses.</p>
              <p>If the lock-up is early, I would expect a pause and a slight rpm drop. But for these VOs, the rpm drop is a little steep, and the pause is shorter than what I would expect for a lock-up. Lock-up takes longer and more jerky. And what I thought was transition to 2nd for these buses should actually be the lock-up. The change is more obvious and the drop in rpm is less.</p>
              <p>And no wonder too.....a quick check on the gear ratios showed that the difference between 1st and 2nd are the greatest amongst the gears. Which proved all the more that these buses were actually changing from 1st to 2nd rather than locking-up.</p>

              <p><br> Honestly I can't tell much from that clip....not to say that the
              quality sucked, but I have to be there to experience it haha.</p>
              <p>Initially I thought that for such VOs the lock-up is too early.
              But now I think back, these buses are closer to the Lance, MKIV etc
              etc than 9208K. These buses change to 2nd at fairly low rpm, then
              attempt to pull through 2nd at even lower rpms and then struggle to
              proceed to lock-up at 2nd. Obviously there's a reason why the VOs
              are usually made to lock-up at 1st and at fairly high rpms, because
              half the time you get a kick in your butt when the bus switches
              back to 1st.</p>
              <p>In that clip however, I have no inkling of where's the lock-up,
              so honestly I can't say much about it. If you're looking for the
              above mentioned buses, I would say it is more likely to occur in
              the batch 3 types. Some I remember include 9630Z, 9638C. Light
              pressure on the pedal would induce that effect on these buses.</p>
              <p>If the lock-up is early, I would expect a pause and a slight rpm
              drop. But for these VOs, the rpm drop is a little steep, and the
              pause is shorter than what I would expect for a lock-up. Lock-up
              takes longer and more jerky. And what I thought was transition to
              2nd for these buses should actually be the lock-up. The change is
              more obvious and the drop in rpm is less.</p>
              <p>And no wonder too.....a quick check on the gear ratios showed
              that the difference between 1st and 2nd are the greatest amongst
              the gears. Which proved all the more that these buses were actually
              changing from 1st to 2nd rather than locking-up.</p>

              <p>There's a distinction between gear change and lock-up when there's an abrupt drop in rpm.<br><br>For the latter, I know some buses tend to lock-up too early and this means it has to lock-up again. This is due to a faulty setting, and fits the description you have described, which is, it fails half the time. They did not move on to the second gear but tried to rev again at first gear once more.<br><br>For the former, the pitch of the engine will be entirely different (though it may sound minimal to most people) when it's at second gear, and the rpm drop is actually not as abrupt as a faulty lock-up.<br><br>Most ZF gearboxes will, when it had cleared the first gear then dropped back to second gear and wishes to accelerate, lock-up at the second gear. This lock-up will sound like it is dragging and will take longer. The ones which will occasionally jump back to first gear and rev up again are usually LO3x's and 6HP's on B9TL and KUB. A small number of Striders do that too.<br><br>Maybe you can give me the regos of the VO3x's next time then I'll visit the buses. (:</p>

              <p>If you could come for any outings, look for me. I can explain it to you.... or if the driver allows, you might want to observe the gear change of an OC500LE at the dashboard. Ignore the 5th and 6th gear and treat it as 4th, but most importantly look out for 1st gear on startup and 2nd gear lock-up after slowing down (e.g. after negotiating a bend or traffic junction).</p>

              <p>If you could come for any outings, look for me. I can explain it to you.... or if the driver allows, you might want to observe the gear change of an OC500LE at the dashboard. Ignore the 5th and 6th gear and treat it as 4th, but most importantly look out for 1st gear on startup and 2nd gear lock-up after slowing down (e.g. after negotiating a bend or traffic junction).</p>

              <p>its way too far to board OCs as such buses dont passby near me. i rather observe on KUBs and B9TLs. their accelerations was a music to me. anyway, thx for explanation.</p>
