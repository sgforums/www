              <p>2nd paragraph: Everything is correct except that it does not downshift, it disengages lock-up at 2nd gear. The shift from 2nd gear to 1st gear occurs only at a very low speed (except LO which can be relatively higher) just as the bus comes to a stop, is characterised by a jerk, which is most audible on a SMRTB Dennis Lance just before it comes to a stop.

              <p><br>For Voith, if you notice, the 1st gear needs to be revved to high rpm because axle and engine are not connected. You'll get the feeling that the engine is pushing hard at the last stages of 1st, and yet the acceleration seemed to have plateued off. That's because of power loss in the high rpm regime without lock-up.</p>
              <p>Upon transition to 2nd, the bus transits gears and at the same time locks-up. The difference with and without lock-up is obvious. Most voith buses don't stay long in 2nd.</p>
              <p>The biggest clue to look out for the lock-up is the feeling that the acceleration does not match the engine's output. And if you notice, if the BC lets go of the pedal in 1st, the engine rpm drops at once. If its locked-up, the rpm should match the axle speed. For 2nd onwards you don't get that.</p>
              <p>So if there's lock-up, when the hell did it engaged?</p>
              <p>The answer came from taking a worn-out 792Z and a few other MKIIIs. These Voiths prove interesting. During transition to 2nd, unlike the normal voiths that lock-up and transit in a split second, these ones attempt to lock-up, and then transit. So what you hear is the high pitch whine of the engine suddenly getting lower and lower as the engine speed slowly matches the axle speed and then with a terrific jerk, the lock-up engages and the bus goes into 2nd at that same moment.</p>
              <p>For that, this is where the biggest strength of ZF lies. A Voith down-shifting will not disengage lock-up unless its a 2nd to 1st. Consequently you'll notice that most Voiths prefer to kick-down all the way to 1st at relatively high speeds to achieve high torque input to the axle. For ZF, if the bus needs to disengage lock-up upon down-shifting to achieve that, it is capable of doing so. So for Voith, if it goes back to 1st at high speed, what you get is a overworked engine and practically no effect on the axle.</p>
              <p>Just a side note, just like a manual where you lift your foot off the pedal and depress the clutch, for the lock-up clutch to engage the same should occur. But for some worn-out ZFs, the engine does not stop and what you get is a nauseating grinding sound as the lock-up engages.<img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              for sony ericsson's phones rite, can it record via the handsfree

              For Voith, if you notice, the 1st gear needs to be revved to high
              rpm because axle and engine are not connected. You'll get the
              feeling that the engine is pushing hard at the last stages of 1st,
              and yet the acceleration seemed to have plateued off. That's
              because of power loss in the high rpm regime without lock-up.</p>
              <p>Upon transition to 2nd, the bus transits gears and at the same
              time locks-up. The difference with and without lock-up is obvious.
              Most voith buses don't stay long in 2nd.</p>
              <p>The biggest clue to look out for the lock-up is the feeling that
              the acceleration does not match the engine's output. And if you
              notice, if the BC lets go of the pedal in 1st, the engine rpm drops
              at once. If its locked-up, the rpm should match the axle speed. For
              2nd onwards you don't get that.</p>
              <p>So if there's lock-up, when the hell did it engaged?</p>
              <p>The answer came from taking a worn-out 792Z and a few other
              MKIIIs. These Voiths prove interesting. During transition to 2nd,
              unlike the normal voiths that lock-up and transit in a split
              second, these ones attempt to lock-up, and then transit. So what
              you hear is the high pitch whine of the engine suddenly getting
              lower and lower as the engine speed slowly matches the axle speed
              and then with a terrific jerk, the lock-up engages and the bus goes
              into 2nd at that same moment.</p>
              <p>For that, this is where the biggest strength of ZF lies. A Voith
              down-shifting will not disengage lock-up unless its a 2nd to 1st.
              Consequently you'll notice that most Voiths prefer to kick-down all
              the way to 1st at relatively high speeds to achieve high
              torque input to the axle. For ZF, if the bus needs to disengage
              lock-up upon down-shifting to achieve that, it is capable of doing
              so. So for Voith, if it goes back to 1st at high speed, what you
              get is a overworked engine and practically no effect on the
              axle.</p>
              <p>Just a side note, just like a manual where you lift your foot
              off the pedal and depress the clutch, for the lock-up clutch to
              engage the same should occur. But for some worn-out ZFs, the engine
              does not stop and what you get is a nauseating grinding sound as
              the lock-up engages.<img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <br><br>
              By the way, for ZF when disengaging lock-up and revving up from second gear, techinically the gearbox does not drop to first gear, except in rare cases when the speed of the bus is really low, or in some LO's, which will result in a very strong jerk.</p>

              <p>Oh, and BTW....if you guys apply the same theory I used to try to figure out about the lock-up, then the W3E's "slip-gear" should also be the lock-up clutch in action.</p>
              <p>Before the "slip" occurs, if the BC lifts his foot off the pedal, the engine rpm falls much steeper than the axle speed. If the BC suddenly jams the pedal, there is apparently a slight lag as the axle tries to catch up with the engine.</p>
              <p>Once the "slip" occurs, you won't have such things anymore.</p>

              <p> as for the seats and stuff it all depends on your
              equipment. For those standard recorders I believe anywhere would be
              good. For my MP3 player I used for my recordings its best not to
              sit too far back, or else it will only produce static noises.</p>

              <p>Haha! 594K actually sounds like a AMDEP bus you know! And actually, there was a time when 594K's engine had a grinding sound, but i wondered how they repaired it though...</p>
