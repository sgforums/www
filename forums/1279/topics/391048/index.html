              <p>ABOARD A Cosy Express, commuters get a whole extra hour of shuteye before school.</p>
              <p>Having
              suffered long rides to their universities for the past three years,
              three young women launched their own bus service, dubbed Ace, which
              allows university students to avoid bus-to-train transits, and save up
              to 30 minutes in travel time.</p>
              <p>Its buses serve 75
              subscribers, called Acers, picking them up in the east - namely, Pasir
              Ris, Tampines and Bedok - and dropping them off at campuses in the
              west.</p>
              <p>Acers who might have previously needed
              two hours to get to school, can now get there in an hour to 90 minutes
              if traffic is smooth.</p>
              <p>Fares cost $3.70 per ride
              to the National University of Singapore (NUS) in Kent Ridge and $3.80
              to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Jurong.</p>
              <p>Commuters
              must sign up for at least one ride a week for the entire semester, and
              keep to a strict schedule of pick-up times, although Ace has also
              issued one-time tickets of $5 since last week to raise profits.</p>

              A cosy ride for varsity commuters
              Eisen Teo

              17 February 2010
              Straits Times
              English
              (c) 2010 Singapore Press Holdings Limited
              
              They can sleep through ride from the east to campuses in the west, and save time too.
              
              ABOARD A Cosy Express, commuters get a whole extra hour of shuteye before school.
              
              Having suffered long rides to their universities for the past three years, three young women launched their own bus service, dubbed Ace, which allows university students to avoid bus-to-train transits, and save up to 30 minutes in travel time.
              
              Its buses serve 75 subscribers, called Acers, picking them up in the east - namely, Pasir Ris, Tampines and Bedok - and dropping them off at campuses in the west.
              
              Acers who might have previously needed two hours to get to school, can now get there in an hour to 90 minutes if traffic is smooth.
              
              Fares cost $3.70 per ride to the National University of Singapore (NUS) in Kent Ridge and $3.80 to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Jurong.
              
              Commuters must sign up for at least one ride a week for the entire semester, and keep to a strict schedule of pick-up times, although Ace has also issued one-time tickets of $5 since last week to raise profits.
              
              The first three bus runs - two to NTU and one to NUS - started two weeks ago, with the earliest just before 7am.
              
              Every Monday to Friday until the end of the school semesters in April, these buses pull in at bus stops outside Pasir Ris, Tampines and Bedok MRT stations for boarding.
              
              They reach NTU at 8.30am and 9.30am, and NUS at 10am - barring traffic snarls.
              
              The fares are daunting for some, like Mr Daniel Chan, 21, who lives in Upper Paya Lebar. '$3.70 is kind of expensive for me, and I'm fine reading my lecture notes on the bus,' said the first-year NUS arts student, who spends about $2 and 90 minutes to get to school via two buses.
              
              Others, latecomers who are not used to Ace's strict pick-up timings, have been left behind.
              
              But the rest are grateful.
              
              Instead of having to stand for an hour on the MRT train and transfer from bus to train and back again, Tampines resident Ng Jin Bao, 25, a second-year engineering student at NTU, saves about 30 minutes.
              
              He said: 'Now I can sit down in comfort.'
              
              In fact, aboard an NTU-bound bus two weeks ago, most of the 15 passengers, including Mr Ng, had fallen asleep by the time the bus hit the expressway.
              
              Two of Ace's three 22-year-old founders - Miss Ashli Koe, who is a final-year business student at NUS, and Miss Joycelyn Ho, currently unemployed - had commuting woes too. Getting to and from school took Miss Koe, who lives in Serangoon North, up to two hours.
              
              Seven months ago, with mutual friend Miss Ho Khim Rong, an educational trainer, the two ploughed $5,000 of their money into the start-up.
              
              Through fliers, viral e-mails and a website (www.acosyexpress.com.sg), they received about 650 responses, and from there chose to launch routes that served the most people.
              
              They hired 20- to 40-seater buses from three private operators, which could set them back by up to $100 per bus a day.
              
              Despite monthly running costs of up to $4,200, Ace hopes to break even by May, so more routes can be launched, including an evening route from campuses in the west towards the east.

              <p>2 points to note:</p>
              <p>- one of the stopping points is located along a bus lane and looking at the timing, the bus will be stopping at this point during bus lane operating hours. This means that if LTA were to interfere, you can say bye bye to that stopping point and most likely it would, else it will be unfair to other private bus operators who were rejected for its use.</p>
              <p>- this service looks more like a shuttle service which requires users to pay for its usage rather than a charter service. Therefore, a PTC license is required to operate it. Unless you can argue that it is a charter service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. PTC licenses bus services and not LTA.</p>
