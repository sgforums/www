            <div class='col-md body'>Well, put it this way, SBS Transit will try to put a fleet of full air con buses on a service when they could of course.  However, not all services warrant the use of Air Con buses maybe due to low demand; and not all pax also want to take air-con buses.<br><br>The thing is some people complain of lack of new services; lousy frequency; no air-con buses.  It's difficult to satisfy the demands of everyone.  Remember SBS Transit has limited resources too.  So yeah...but I think SBS Transit is doing their best to have a near 100% air-con fleet.<br><br>And one thing, try not to compare SBS Transit with SMRT Buses.  Such comparison won't get anywhere.  Both companies have their unique strengths and weaknesses.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 28_29_293:</div><div class="quote_body">38/82/291/293 should be fully aircon fleet. but duno y there are cameos of non aircon single deck buses.

            <div class='col-md body'>the frequency bout sv57 is quite horrible today.. at 1115 hrs, i was at Bishan, and i looked at the Bus Departure Moniter. it says 57 departs at 1137.. means <strong>27 minutes</strong>! (i actually saw a 57 bus left at 1110).  and its advetised freq is 15-17mins  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  luckily theres alternative services..</div>

Delays could be caused by bus break down or traffic jams. Look at service 27, it's a popular service but SBST put so many buses on svc 27. It's pretty common to see 3 27's buses at one time, I wished SBST can do the same for other services like 518 (Peak hours), 36 ...etc . </div></blockquote>Sometimes, we also need to see if that particular Depot have enough buses to spare..</div>

I know that 163 only stop at Toa Payoh to rest for 3 - 5 mins then go again but how come she said only Sengkang INT can check the timing and if Toa Payoh INT dont have the timing..how come the TV can display the next bus timing?Can you experts give some assistance? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
