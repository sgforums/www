            <div class='col-md body'>Today sit Sv 82 with my friends for bus rides from Punggol Rd(opp Rivervale Plaza) then loop at Punggol Rd End then go back to our home. The bus driver drove very fast even on the two-lane Punggol Rd to the End there around 60-70kmh. When the bus reached Punggol Rd End, everybody alighted, then the BC waved his hands to ask me to get down. But I told him that I want to continue. He waved again to asked me to get down but I told him that I want to continue. After I said that, he flared up and scolded me and my friend to get down. When we got down he shouted at us on saying that we need to get down because of the time thing??? Then we waited at the bus stop like bamboo. While the BC was resting inside in the bus walking here and there and using his HP. After a few mins, he allowed us to board again and need to pay again. I also said sorry to him then we continue our journey. I thought Sv 82 is a loop service why this BC don't let me sit inside and wait while at other times I took and still can sit inside. Can anyone explain this??? Thanks a lot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><strong>PS: I just want to share this experience with all of you and not really complaning In case next time sekali got happen so you will know what to do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </strong></div>
