              <p>For the first time, the two public transport - SMRT and SBS Transit
              have come together to organise a job fair to attract and train about
              280 Singaporean bus drivers.</p>
              <p>They are tapping $3.2 million worth in SPUR funding in the process,
              and plans to use it over the next two years to recruit 560 local bus
              drivers in all.</p>
              <p><em>Geraldine Soh</em> finds out if locals will take the bait.</p>
              <p>The basic monthly pay is between $1,000 to $1,200.</p>
              <p>But by working overtime, that could go up to between $1,700 and $2,500, excluding travel benefits and bonuses.</p>
              <p>The low pay is not the only reason why locals shun the job.</p>
              <p>President of the National Transport Workers' Union Lau Lye Hock.</p>
              <p>"Our members have to get up early in the morning 2am to prepare for
              their early shift. And when they do the afternoon shift, they end late,
              these are the two challenges."</p>
              <p>Mr Lau says the union is trying to negotiate for a higher starting
              pay and more flexible working hours for the nearly 7,000 public bus
              drivers, most of who are their members.</p>
              <p>With the transport companies facing greater pressure to increase bus
              service frequencies, and plans to expand their fleet, SMRT
              Corporation's President and CEO Saw Phaik Hwa says they've had to
              schedule in more overtime work for their current drivers.</p>
              <p>Either this, or resort to hiring foreigners.</p>
              <p>A quarter of the SMRT's 1,700 bus drivers are Singaporeans, the rest are PRs, Malaysians or Chinese nationals.</p>
              <p>At SBS Transit, 40 percent of their 5,200 bus drivers are Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Friday's job fair, with 280 vacancies attracted 77 job seekers in the first few hours.</p>
              <p>220 had initially registered, but after an industry briefing and screening programme, the number was whittled down.</p>
              <p>35-year-old R Kannan was among the job seekers.</p>
              <p>The science degree holder chose SMRT over SBS Transit, citing the
              five-day work week and higher starting salary as the main draw.</p>
              <p>He says at a job fair some months back, SBS Transit had offered only
              $1,000 in monthly starting pay for five-and-a-half-days of work.</p>
              <p>"You must be interested in the work, but you must earn money also right? You no money how can?"</p>
              <p>SMRT CEO Saw Phaik Hwa:</p>
              <p>"There's no end to more salary being more attractive. I think the
              reality is what the industry can bear and be competitive for the great
              of the people we're employing. Several years back we started on a
              five-day week. I think it's quite unheard of, which is really quite
              cutting-edge."</p>
              <p>SBS Transit's Executive Director Gan Juay Kiat.</p>
              <p>"But captains, they would have been scheduled daily small amount of
              overtime. We're very mindful to make sure they don't exceed the law of
              72 hours per month. Our priority is to recruit more Singaporeans and we
              constantly review our salary packages, to make sure it's market
              competitive."</p>
              <p>52-year-old Ismail bin Hassan, says he's prepared to work overtime
              for $1,500 as it offers more stability than his taxi driving stint.</p>
              <p>Compared with his previous job as an operation technician, $1,200 in starting pay is also much better.</p>
              <p>"In present situation got no choice because for us above 50 they ask
              our age then they call us back but they never call back so it's very
              make you feel very down. I'm prepared if i don't get this I will go
              back to driving taxi. "</p>
              <p>Mr Ismail is among the 30 applicants who got the job of a bus driver.</p>

              <p>I personally feel that $1200 for starting pay is still pretty low...</p>
              <p>But low pay is nonetheless better than no pay....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I think this job will be good for supplementary income rather than for main income.</p>
