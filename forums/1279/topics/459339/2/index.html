              when you crippled and in wheelchair you see how convenient it
              is for you to use public transport instead of taxi or car before
              the introduction of wheelchair accessible buses and services.</p>

              <p>This is fact. Government should imply a private bus or something(that's cheap) for this disabled people. You can't simply because the bus is crowded, force some passengers to alight and wait for the next bus, and allow the disabled people to board do you? As you should know, during peak hours, there's confirm no space in the bus or train. </p>
              <p>Further more, I never say that LTA shouldn't implement, but rather a "Not fully WAB transport". Why? Cause during non-peak hours, there's still disabled people. Their boarding chances is higher. But during peak hours, their chance is low(besides waiting at interchange), and the non-WAB(probably bendy etc.) can take more pax.</p>

              <p>I prefer those additional cost to cater the minority. Or perhaps something that's on standby, when there's PIW, the WAB vehicle can be dispatch. Both benefits~ Plus, I don't think it will even affect my family or relatives when there's even WAB.</p>
              <p>I find it troublesome too(even if there's WAB buses/trains, imagine travelling from Home to somewhere like Punggol, normal bus route would delay a lot of time). I don't think you would take home service to interchange, transfer to MRT(if I start from Marsiling) down to Dhoby Ghaut, and up again to Punggol when I can simply call for a cab(London Cab) and reach my destination fast? </p>
              <p>Even if I am staying at Woodlands(example), to go Bedok, I can take svc168. However, being a PIW, I would much prefer a faster way, aka Cab(or some private WAB buses/vehicle). Unless a PIW is travelling short distance, the WAB feature isn't really of much use. </p>
              <p>Perhaps 70% of Public transport fleet is WAB, whereas 30% will remain non-WABs. And probably increase the no. of WABs for those private vehicles(for those WAB ppl to charter/flag down).</p>

              <p>I prefer those additional cost to cater the minority. Or perhaps something that's on standby, when there's PIW, the WAB vehicle can be dispatch. Both benefits~ Plus, I don't think it will even affect my family or relatives when there's even WAB.</p>
              <p>I find it troublesome too(even if there's WAB buses/trains, imagine travelling from Home to somewhere like Punggol, normal bus route would delay a lot of time). I don't think you would take home service to interchange, transfer to MRT(if I start from Marsiling) down to Dhoby Ghaut, and up again to Punggol when I can simply call for a cab(London Cab) and reach my destination fast? </p>
              <p>Even if I am staying at Woodlands(example), to go Bedok, I can take svc168. However, being a PIW, I would much prefer a faster way, aka Cab(or some private WAB buses/vehicle). Unless a PIW is travelling short distance, the WAB feature isn't really of much use. </p>
              <p>Perhaps 70% of Public transport fleet is WAB, whereas 30% will remain non-WABs. And probably increase the no. of WABs for those private vehicles(for those WAB ppl to charter/flag down).</p>
              <p>Anyway, this isn't any "flame wars"~~</p>

              <p>Watching his posts all I can see is that he likes to target others a lot. Especially when people has offended him previously, but he chose to continue pestering. He thinks that he can spoil TIB868X's reputation just like that. But instead, he brought harm to himself. No one likes it when one repeats an incident which is long ago history countless times, it really pisses everyone off.</p>
