              <p>Singapore buses are classified either as public buses or private buses. Public buses are those under SBST, SMRT and SJE. They are also known as Omnibuses. Private buses are therefore those buses that are not Omnibuses. They are further classified as Private Bus (PB), Private Hire Bus (PH), Excursion Bus (PZ) and School Bus (CB). These include SMRT's livery private buses. Depending on how you want to use the bus, you would need to apply to LTA on the appropriate classification. Years back, a bus can only be used as what it is supposed to be used for. Example, a school bus must be used as a school bus and it cannot be used as a private bus, a private hire bus or an excursion bus. You can refer to LTA website on the details of these classifications.</p>
              <p>However, LTA recently (couple of years back) allow secondary usage of these buses as long as it is approved by them. That means, a School Bus can also be used as a Private Hire Bus. This is where the classification becomes blurred. Hence, a generic plate prefix was introduced. This is where you see all the PA, PC buses being registered and the PB, PH, PZ and CB prefixes would not be used for newly registered buses. Existing buses still retain these prefixes.</p>
              <p>Class 3 licence holders can also drive a bus. What really matters is the size of the bus. Normally those buses with pax capacity of 11 seaters can be driven by Class 3 licence holders. Vocational licences are required for all buses except private buses. Also, all buses can drive into bus lanes during bus lanes operational hours BUT only omnibuses are allowed to stop at bus stops located along these bus lanes. That being said, they are only allowed to stop at approved stopping points. So it is not correct for 74e to stop at the bus stop before CTE during AM Peak.</p>

              <p>Wrong.</p>
              <p>PH was used for Private Hire<br>PB was for Private Buses</p>
              <p>Please take note of the difference between Private Hire and Private Buses. Private Hire means that the bus is privately owned but can be hired/chartered by another person. Private Bus simply means the bus is privately owned for use by the entity/company.</p>
              <p>Thats why regos skip from PA to PC.</p>
