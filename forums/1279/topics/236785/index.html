I have been in NUS for almost 4 years and I can also see the improvements to 95 (although most of the improvements came only in the past one year...) So you're the one who kept sending the complaints to SBST... Haha... Thank you for the good job!<br><br>Actually I don't see why 96 and 151 cannot use DD... In Hong Kong, there are many hilly roads which have DDs (like First bus 15 to the Peak, or Citybus 6 to Stanley). Even in Singapore, 179 and 199 also got DD... so "DD cannot climb slope" is not an excuse.<br><br>But 95 cannot use DD because of the low bridge between Yusof Ishak House and the Sports &amp; Recreation Centre. (The allowance is only 4.4m)<br><br>Actually NUS students who live in the East and North should learn to take the NUS shuttle bus BTC1. BTC1 travels non-stop from the bus stop along Bukit Timah Rd (outside Bukit Timah Campus) to the bus stop outside the music conservatory (opposite Raffles Hall), where students can transfer to shuttle bus A2, B or C. The journey time from Bukit Timah to the music conservatory is only around 10 minutes, compared to 20-30 minutes on 151. Somemore BTC1 is free, and seats are plenty (unlike 95 or 96 where students pack like sardines). Haha. The frequency of BTC1 is 15-20 minutes on weekdays. You can refer to http://nusinfo.nus.edu.sg/oed/services/csd/transportation/btcshuttlebusservice.htm</div>

In Hong Kong, there are many hilly roads which have DDs (like First bus 15 to the Peak, or Citybus 6 to Stanley).

The tridents on NWFB Svc 15 are special in a way that they are only 4.13M tall and 10.3M long.. So, in alot of ways, they are different from the DDs that we have.</div>

In the end, I had to take 200 home from there.<br><br>Hey by the way, I thought that 95 do pick up passengers at the Kent Ridge Terminal but on that day, 95s, yes more than 1 xD,  were just passing by the terminal, ignoring my flagging. It seemds as though that that wasn't a stop for 95 and furthermore, all those 95s were not being parked at the terminal, on the way off to somewhere else. It seems rather inefficient to let 95s pass by the terminal and drive off directly somewhere else.<br><br>But then again, those are just my speculations. xD.</div>

Once I waited for a BTC1 for more than 1 hour during the evening peak hour!!!<br><br>But after NUS received feedback and changed BTC1 into a one-directional service, there is a big improvement of the frequency. At least the frequency is reliable on weekdays. Now, out of 10 times I take BTC1, 9 times the bus comes within 10 minutes. (5 times out of 10 the bus comes within 5 minutes. Today I only waited for 1 minute.) Of course, I won't recommend BTC1 on weekends and during NUS vacation, when the frequency is 60 minutes.<br><br>Curiously, whenever I take 151 towards Kent Ridge, I'm the only one who alight outside Bukit Timah campus to change to BTC1. All the other people just stayed on the 151 all the way to NUS... (It's the same when I take 48, 153 or 154. Most of the time I'm the only one who alight at that bus stop.)</div>
