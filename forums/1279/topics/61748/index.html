I take it everyday to school and I think a more appropriate proportion (at least for now) would be 70% air-con 30% non-air-con though this proportion can change significantly at different times of the year. Now because of the school holidays (for secondary schools and JCs), there are significantly fewer people boarding 74 in the direction of buona vista in the morning (surely can find a seat on the bus) and SBS Transit has been employing a larger number of single-deckered 74s than before.</div>
