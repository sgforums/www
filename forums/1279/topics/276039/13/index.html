Can you like bloody give more hints?<br><br>13. The first part cannot be detemined as the driver does jump bus regardless of the shift type on 293. Exception are the 37 xover buses.

When I checked on SBS 2803M the next day, which was on <span style="font-style: italic;">Express</span> 518, the back of the bus was totally undamaged, save for some slight scratches.<br>3. Correct.<br>4. Correct.<br>5. Correct.<br>6. Correct, but there are more to this answer.<br>10. Correct. 'SBS 233 X' got it in his siggy. I also know that SBS 0914P does S shift first before I saw the siggy.<br>11. Correct, but actually it also did Service 18 too. Took this bus for two/three consecutive days from the weekday of the IMF onwards.<br>12. Seems that it's quite hard to notice there. Actually, it's SBS 0591L. If you walk closer to the bus, you may notice that one of the 'S' is handwritten.<br>13. Yeah, it cannot be determined but I noticed that she would normally drive SBS 3664R.<br>14. I give you the full one point for this question, but actually I'm asking for the first bus to be in the show. It's SBS 0896H that came first.<br>15. Check my rides. Normally the bus stop I always go to is opposite to the Community Centre. 'choww' also once told me that I may be familiar with the place. FYI, the bus stop I frequent is equivalent to T2 in the 225 timesheet.<br><br>The answer is SBS 2807C. If you have seen my rides and watched drama shows on Channel 8, the answer would be out, but I will also let you off for this question.<br><br>You got the highest so far - 10 points!</div>
