              <p>When I was still around, I told the RGT to help out the faults that they can rectify regardless which depot are they from. Because ultimately if my guys don't help out, the route group is going to suffer with a lack of bus. And then if the Route Group suffers, the commuters suffer because lesser bus to take.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also advocated the release of expensive items to be kept by RGT to be used to repair buses which are in need. Eg. Signal indicators. And if in the case when these expensive items are given to the other depot buses, we will record down and the manager decide whether to claim from the depot during the productivity meeting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some door problems can be rectified on the spot. Like the door cannot close. Many times it's due to the door button at the driver side. Or the door ECU. The Door system of SBS Transit is under DEANS. Or sometimes it's due to door pump leaking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wiper not working could highly be due to corroded wiper motor splines. I gave spring washers to the RGT to temporarily tighten the wiper blade to the splines. But if the wiper motor is not working and it's raining plus the driver is not confident to drive in the rain the bus will have to return.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I know that some RGT from other depots do not practice what I did. They simply just send the bus back to SL because it's not their bus. But it's an integrity issue. I'd rather help out when my guys can help out since everyone is under SBS Transit. And the commuters' interests should be highest priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that I have left, I do not know how my successor has planned things out. But likely things should remain the same.</p>

              <p><br>Me myself also not very clear of the answer but what I heard of was partly wat u said above. The mechanic may help to solve minor problem such as door, signal problem but not others. If the bus breakdown at the interchange, they would need to call it's own in charge , report the incident and they would call the tow car down.</p>

              <p>Similarly if the bus breakdown in the interchange and this bus is from another depot. Who would cover up that timing?</p>
              <p>Example: SBS 339A(SL 157) breakdown in Toa payoh.</p>
              <p>Or if, 2 buses from another depot did not manage to come back to the interchange in time and even exceeded the time that they need to departure again.</p>
              <p>Example: Timetable sequence.. (SBS 214B(BR 157) --&gt; (SBS 9096R(BR 157))</p>
              <p>SBS 214B should be back at Boon Lay at 8.30am and depart at 8.45am<br>SBS 9096R should be back at Boon Lay at 8.40am and depart at 8.55am</p>
              <p>Both buses did not came back until 9.10am. Who would cover up the timing? What do BNL route group do?</p>
