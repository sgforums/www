            <div class='col-md body'>The fares are already out and it will be 5 cents to 25 cents more expensive than current SMRT fares. No increment to students, child and NSMen fares.<br><br>10 cent discount will be given for commuters during the first 3 months of operation. However SBS Transit do not expect any profits for the first 2 years of operation, and even said that it will not break even for the next 2 years of operation. The discount will cost SBS Transit $2 million. SBS Transit has proposed higher fares in order to make up for the losses.<br><br>On a side note, there wasn't any mention of bus service rationalization. Though there was a mention of SBS Transit 'keeping a service from Dhoby Ghaut to Sengkang, so as to provide an alternative to the NEL'. Which in my opinion is that we would see Service 85 operating for a longer time than previously anticipated.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

However, Kai Guan told me that PTC had allowed 9 routes to be amended while routes going to be withdrawn are still pending approval.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this whole NEL has been monopolised by SBS Transit and it would make perfect sense for SBS Transit to take out some buses as to them, PROFITS are always the most important rather than the customers, can anyone in the NE area complain? No because SBS Transit has won the right to that area so they can withdraw any service they like. So you either take their MRT or take their bus, no other  way except you take cab.</div>

Hope that these 2 svc won't be affected much else svc 854 &amp; 965 may be the only Tibs svc in NE area.<br></div>

Svc 147 doesn't go to Sengkang. Neither does Svc 103.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
