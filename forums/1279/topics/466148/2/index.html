              <p>It's simple lah, she just wants to gain sympathy~~</p>
              <p>Seriously lah, people are stating the truth about BIS, wondering why he/she's taking it as "cyberbullying". Don't tell me that BIS's picture quality kiam cai isn't true? Further more, BIS said that they are different from others - they don't chase random cameos like siao. But what do you see now? All the pages are just random cameos with some lame captions. Isn't it again true? </p>
              <p>If this is being sent to police, I'm sure BIS is going to get it, especially those taken outside C&amp;C/ST Kinetic. </p>
