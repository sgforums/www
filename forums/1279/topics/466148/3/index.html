              So, roughly about 30 more or so to 2000 likes for the number one page on Singapore Buses~

              <p>Study more?</p>
              <p>Definitely.</p>
              <p>I have 3 A*s in math and science... I take triple science... I've met all my promotion criteria this month... my teachers say I have good learning attitude and I should aim for a scholarship, I was selected for an OELP trip that was unfortunately cancelled due to inter-Korean tensions on the border... and I topped the class with a GPA of 3.8 (4.0 if you count my A*s) this term.</p>
              <p>Still think you can do better? Challenge me then. Top in class for english, physics and chemistry, top 3 for biology... say I'm such a showoff? Continue saying... because at least I have stuff to gloat about, unlike you.</p>
              <p>There you said it already - keyword "before". It's a before thing, why are you still harping on it now. If there's a chance to leave those so-called "gangsters", as you call it, behind, do it then, and LEAVE them behind, instead of keeping them in the back of your mind and ranting about them whenever you have the chance. You know, quietly forgetting and moving on, it's actually a gift to yourself. If you complain you've not been loved enough, maybe you should learn to forgive. That'll be the first gift you get, and the best thing is that it's actually from yourself.</p>
              <p>I'm not being delusional - I already said that people are free to believe what they believe in. If they choose to believe in you, no one will stop them. If they choose to believe that YOU'RE delusional, likewise let them be. Some things in life are controllable, but most things are beyond your league. If you have friends, treasure them. If you lose friends, treasure the ones you have more.</p>
              <p>I don't fabricate stories. I don't have the time to fabricate them. There's a reason why I'm doing so well now, because I know how to prioritise. And if there's any reason I'm posting here - exams are over, I've done my e-learning assignments, I've worked hard this term and I deserve free time.</p>
              <p>In fact I'm not even affected - what medication, I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe it's futile trying to talk sense into you, maybe it's not.</p>
              <p>So just move on. I don't think that BIS is bad, BIS creates conflicts, so on and so forth. BIS is a bus enthusiast page run by a bus enthusiast posting pictures of buses, and there's nothing wrong with it. The only thing that is wrong, is that people need to realise that it's 2013, not 2010/1 now. Like I said - if you're given a chance to start afresh, take it. Because at your age, you don't have many more chances.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
