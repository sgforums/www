              <p>I think the pay disparity all boils down to the cheap influx of
                  foreign workers. These people work long hours without
                  complaining and draw the salary which is relatively higher as
                  compare in their homeland.</p>
              <p>Maybe we should do the same for the MPs (who are drawing 4X
                  higher than the US ministers). Import all these foreign MPs and I
                  am pretty sure they can do the job which our MPs are currently
                  doing, if not much better, at a lower pay.</p>
              <p>Also, there is this article in the ST about productivity, all
                  bus captain from SBST must know at least 3 route and must know
                  how to drive single and double deckers.   </p>

              <p>Agree. Plus the worst part is while most of our salaries are pushed downwards, the price of HDB flats keep increasing like mad. Just imagine buying a typical 4-rm HDB flat of around ~$260-290K range (first hand from HDB), plus renovation, furniture. $300K++. The only thing that came down is the floor area! Then not forgetting basic expenses such as internet, phone, h/p, utilities, kid's expenses... how to survive? Then our leaders kept lamenting we reluctant to produce more offsprings?</p>

              <p>Productivity is over-hyped. So is "meritocracy". Just how much do you want to squeeze from your people?</p>
              <p>We score high on HDI and GDP per capita, but we score badly in "happiness". And when world bank comes up with the new scheme that's coming up that includes leisure as part of the calculations for welfare and well-being, we'll simply slip further behind.</p>

              <p>Our leaders only good at justify for their huge salary that they are drawing. High pay is needed to have a clean and corrupt free nation. When we kao peh of our low pay, they say we are not up to the par. When we complain HDB too expensive, they said is still affordable.</p>
              <p>Now they are singing different tunes, want to control the inflow of foreign workers. and Need to relook HDB rules which may have flaw to encourage people to speculate. Maybe is a hint that a GE is coming, providing some sweeteners to the people?</p>

              <p>there was a TNP news report late last year where this was covered in detail. some trainee who failed the course and was forced to reimburse SMRT for training expenses complained i think. </p>
              <p>the nearest SBST depots to you will be BRBP and AMDEP. if you join SMRT it'll be AMKDEP. all depends on what kind of working life you want. salary-wise SBST will be slightly better. working-wise SMRT has 5 day work week.</p>
              <p>though considering distance from home and such, joining SBST would be wiser. why would you want to wake up excessively early to catch an employee bus to say, amdep when you can cycle to your workplace (brbp) in 10 mins? Whether they will post you to BRBP is another matter but considering your place of residence, the chances are quite high.</p>

              Many of my non-bus fans told me that sg public bus companies are among those few in the world which can still make healthy nett profit, while many public companies in the world are suffering from losses and got to be heavily funded by their govts.
              
              But the salaries of our public bus captains are a little too low, considering the huge sacrifices they have to make; either waking up early in the morning, end work in wee hours of the night, working even on Sun &amp; PH, CNY, endure difficult traffic conditions, nuisance motorists and passengers etc.
              
              Our leaders should consider channelling some funds into public bus companies from motorists taxes to better sustain the public bus companies and attract more locals to join by offering better pay and benefits, while maintaining affordable fares. This may come into play especially when we are facing ageing population, hence more senior citizen fare concessions to be borne by the companies.

              <p>I do agree with the fact that our Bus Captains should earn more than now like around $2500-$3000 at the minimum standard given that their job situation. Given the fact that out local government draws such a huge amount of salary every month, I also do agree that they should channel some amount of money into our local public bus companies so that our Bus Captains gets better pay and also might attract other people to join as Bus Captains, not simply relying on the company itself.</p>

              <p>A small sharing here of how a job of a bus captain (or bus driver) is like overseas in Japan.</p>
              <p>http://www.jrbuskanto.co.jp/recruit/driver.html</p>
              <p>JR Bus Kanto, recruitment for route bus drivers 1: throughout its operation sphere, 2: Tsuchiura area operations (similar to recruiting for a single depot/based at a single depot). In this advertisement they are particularly looking for people for post 2, perhaps of new routes/change of employment scheme.</p>
              <p>All drivers recruited from this advertisement are contract workers (å¥‘ç´„ç¤¾å“¡) and enjoy benefits of the company as a full time worker.</p>
              <p>Job: Route bus driver (basically as a bus captain here).<br>Employment scheme: Contract worker, tests for advancement to full staff given after training.<br>Requirement: 2nd type large vehicle (equal to Class 4 here, they can get this license class just by taking tests at driving centers, anyone above 20 can obtain) without demerit. No questions asked about age and job history (unlike local companies).<br>Pay: Monthly 250,000 JPY and above, bonus twice annually, pay set by the company. Daily pay of 9000 JPY and above, able to earn above 200,000 JPY.<br>Working hours: Depends on route, changes monthly (this includes long distance express bus routes).<br>Benefits: Health insurance, retirement fund insurance (like CPF), employment insurance (more like basic insurance type), accident insurance.<br>Holiday: Determined by the company, 4 days off for 4 weeks, special holidays available (6-day work week).<br>Work locations: Shizuoka. For Tsuchiura, experienced applications will have bonus, aged people welcomed.</p>
              <p>Note: Brackets are added information not translated.</p>
              <p>250,000 JPY is SGD 3294, 9000 JPY is SGD 141 as of post.</p>
              <p>Considering the large amount of routes you may drive (from several kilometers to hundreds of kilometers depending on type), 6-day work week, this 3000 SGD would be hard-earn money. Minus tax and such perhaps left with 2600 to 2800 SGD.</p>
