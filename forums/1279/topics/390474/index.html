              <p>$1300 is only the basic pay, something like you don't drive any bus or do anything for 1 month (standby) the driver will still get paid but with that amount, which is very unlikely. In fact, bus drivers earn more than you might think. Believe it or not, some of the BC pay do get a salary near $3000. If every BC pay would be paid a straight $1300 I think nobody would want to be a BC.</p>

              <p>Malaysia lagi worst than us. That day I went JB... Wanted to buy some stuff from the supermarket... Found out I cant find anything to buy. Either cost the same as us, or more expensive. <br><br>A packet of Royal Umbrella Rice costs like RM70 (SIN$29) in Malaysia... when we are selling at about SIN$28 last year when the rice prices was at its highest.</p>

              <p>From what I know, $1300 is like what other users mention which is the basic pay whereby regardless are you driving anot you will be entiltled with that.</p>
              <p>There bonus that serves as add-on to their pay. Such bonus is like DD bonus which mean drivers get paid more if they drive DD and also of cause overtime which is the pay will be counted hourly. In the other word:</p>
              <p>Overtime 2 hours &gt; SBST count as 2hr x 1.5time = 3 hrs</p>
              <p>So, the driver will get paid for 3 hrs even though he just did 2 hr overtime.</p>
              <p>So in conclusion what i was trying to point out is that drivers do earn more than 1.3k</p>
