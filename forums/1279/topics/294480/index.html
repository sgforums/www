I can assure you, most older enthusiasts here have problems just to explain the enthusiasm of buses we have to family and friends.<br><br>You cannot live, eat and sleep bus all the way. If your friends can't accept your hobby due to whatever reasons they have, join them in non-bus activities, even going for shopping, movies, meals and the lists go on.<br><br>Most bus enthusiasts will live through the stage of being laughed and sniggered at for having some "weird hobbies". As time goes by, you will be respected. You will find your friends willing to accept you and your hobby more.<br><br>You have to adapt, not adapted.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People often ask, "why you like buses?" or "what's so good about buses?" They often ask informally, I would answer them by joking too.<br><br>Actually, thinking about the questions asked, I'd think if others can like cars, why can't we like 'bigger' vehicles?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Others may think we are maybe 'wierdos'? This passion for buses was cultivated when we were young, there's nothing wrong with curiosity. If we like something, we should be determined to fight for what we think is right. Giving up a passion you have been through is seriously a waste of time, and especially when you are criticized by others and you give up. I don't see anything wrong with liking buses, as long as you are not too obsessed and if you forgo some things which are more important than buses, I think it is not worth it. Don't take criticism too seriously. You are not alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

In life, we really got a lot of things to explore on and have fun in it. (Those of you here who are Christians should understand what I say better..)<br><br>This explains why for now, I don't spend as much time as before on buses (as in forums, snap photos, not the normal bus rides that we ride daily), and you would see me post things to forum very seldom, as compared to the past of me..<br><br>I shall not say too much down here... But what I am trying to emphasize is NOT to be so obsessed with buses (or spend a lot of time on bus as a hobby), otherwise, your schoolmates may not like you and soon you will be outcast within your group of schoolmate friends..<br><br>If you really feel that you really wish to chat over this issue/topic, can do so through PM (from there add to MSN and chat from there) =)<br><br>Cheers! ^^</div>

What tintinspartan can do is to really try to blend in with your schoolmates well, and not keep talking about buses which may make your friends feel sicked and tired of it. Perhaps you can start by not spending so much time on buses, and really pursue the things that you really desire for other than buses, and find some time to better socialize with your schoolmates... Slowly, your schoolmates would have a different perspective of you and think that you have changed a lot, and hence they would not dislike you... =)<br><br>What SBS2671B said I agreed to it, just that for you (SBS2671B), try not to be so engrossed in buses and resulting in neglecting not only your studies but your friendship with all your outside friends (be it schoolmates friends etc etc..)..</div>

Let me share my views here...<br><br>Well, my schoolmates definitely would find it weird for me having bus as 1 of our hobbies... But no matter what, my advice to some of you guys here is not to be so obsessed with buses until you really don't care about other stuffs in your life.<br><br>As what I have believe, we cannot just live in this world with only buses, buses and buses... In life, we really got a lot of things to explore on and have fun in it. (Those of you here who are Christians should understand what I say better..)<br><br>This explains why for now, I don't spend as much time as before on buses (as in forums, snap photos, not the normal bus rides that we ride daily), and you would see me post things to forum very seldom, as compared to the past of me..<br><br>I shall not say too much down here... But what I am trying to emphasize is NOT to be so obsessed with buses (or spend a lot of time on bus as a hobby), otherwise, your schoolmates may not like you and soon you will be outcast within your group of schoolmate friends..<br><br>If you really feel that you really wish to chat over this issue/topic, can do so through PM (from there add to MSN and chat from there) =)<br><br>Cheers! ^^</div></blockquote>tintinspartan!! u can PM mi for my msn address also, we can make friends <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  just like wat TIB 1062Y have say. try to balance everything in your life. my classmate everytime when they need any help in going somewhere, they will sms mi n they find its a great help.<br><br>Dun be emo.... u balances up your things, u sure can cope wif your studies, friends n hobby together. I used to be like u also.. crazy about buses everyday. but how i learn how to balacne my things.<br>i have friends, bus fan gang, family, studies, hobby , work and girlfriend to balances. as what TIB 1062Y say... Pm mi for address and we can chat more..<br><br>Regards,<br>TIB 589B</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thing is....<br><br>i started out on this bus hobby collcting bus ticket de. then slowly interest in rego. then the danny chan book came in 1996. ok lorh winner leow lorh. know many thing suddenly.<br><br>the desire to learn more n more about buses , i feel , is a nice thing to have n work for, learning stuff enable u to expand ur horizon and know many stuffs.<br><br>for me if u ask me in 1996 about engine parts i sure draw blanks<br><br>today know a little bit.<br><br>with the internet these days u can pretty much learn up anything u want. esp if in buses. however advise is go borrow book on bus management and stuffs. cuz such things are always best describe and outlined in a scientific treatise written by the professionals in bus industry.<br><br>apparently the bus hobby is almost like trainspotting or airplane spotting. people sit plane / train (oops have be rich)  take pictures (ahh photography is a good thing to learn dudes), read book on plane n train (like read books on bus), gunzel foam etc over train/ planes. like we foam over bus.<br><br>perhaps read up on why ppl do trainspotting n plane spotting...will explain reasons why we like bus?<br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to remind that if you know you are not that popular among friends in schools, try to hide your "crazyness" about buses. Don't talk about buses in front of them. Talk about their common passions such as gaming or hang out with them (good purpose of course), I mean to spend more time communicating with them. They will slowly accept you.<br><br>I don't mind befriending you. PM me and get my MSN contact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the other time STN/ SGEMP open a thread abt having no friends in school and spending his recess in the classroom alone. frankly speaking u remind me of him. obviously others may think ur hobby is weird or sth. if thats the case then talk to them abt other stuff, ur life doesnt just revolve around buses &amp; trains. if they are not reminded abt ur special hobby they might be more willing to associate with u normally. more than 99% of my schoolmates are not enthusiastic abt buses and i dont talk to them abt things like possible fleet deployments of new K230UB. in fact most of them dont even know abt my hobby. one exeption is nenepokey who is my schooolmate and from the same CCA. its good to have someone to talk to in real life abt bus stuff,but theres a lot more other interesting stuff to talk abt anyway. if u talk to ur schoolmates abt other things they (hopefully) might forget abt ur special hobby and be more willing to accept u as an equal.</div>

They find it a bit strange, but then next day  like all forget, back to normal stuff.</div>

But STN is somesrot of lonely at school but when we invite him for KTM Railway Fan Club Outings, he speaks up including the time when we both met and we talked about things that we both share in common. I mean, he's a good friend to have. Remember that he is now studying Biomedical Science.</div>
