Cos I just only treat bus as 1 of my hobbies/interests. Moreover, bus captains also don't earn a lot, and hence, I would really like to venture into something which is really of great interest and at the same time, earn a higher amount of income... ^^</div>

Even though I don't take public transport.<br><br>Everyone will have a hobby. I find my colleagues who are obsessed with golf boring. They can spend one whole weekend in JB trying to conquer the golfcourse. Stay overnight and try to correct their mistake and re-do it again the next day. I find it a waste of money and boring. What's so nice about trying to get a ball so small into a slightly bigger hole in a big plot of land. But to my friend it is an attractive sports which trains and test an individual's patience and thinking capacity.<br><br>I enjoy motorsports. Riding my bike or drive my car in the race circuit. Going round and round trying to beat my previous lap with a faster timing, trying to overtake the next guy I can see at the same time prevent the guy behind from overtaking me. Some people find it stupid running around in circles. Wasting tyres and fuel trying to see who's faster. But I find that it is an attractive sport whereby one's endurance towards pressure &amp; capability to think in the midst of speed and pressure is brought to the test.<br><br>So everybody views beauty differently. One needs to fathom the beauty of the activity in order to appreciate it. Otherwise, it is just a waste of time to that person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to the point I just like to say that actually first thing to do is be your "non-bus" side to people who don't know you first. After a while when you 2 know each other more than you start the bus talk. Or just start if they stumble on subjects about public transport. After that it should be fine. Trust me, I used this method and I am fine. Now my friends collect regos for cameos and tix (it wasn't me who started all the tix collecting; its my friend who did it and I followed suit) and sometimes after the last day of examination there is nothing to do we would run off and catch the bus whom the BC I knew drives (we couldn't catch it on normal days because he is S-Shift) and if TIB465A is doing full day on 911 we would just sit at the bus stop and wait for it,  and also wait for the next bus (only on 911) if the one stopping currently is a bendy (I don't really like bendies on 911) and the best thing of all .... ....<br><br>... ... we still stick together as friends <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My "fame" started off this way:<br><br>In secondary one, all of us in the class had to decorate our desk, reason is to prevent us from vandalising our desk, at least we can vandalize on our decorations <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . We were told to decorate our desk with anything we like. At first I told me classmate sitting beside me that I want to put bus photos, she say "you siao ar?". I went on with it, and the theme for my desk was "SUPERBUS". Got some bus pix. Admiring my desk everyday (just joking). Because of this, many people who visited my classroom could easily identify where I sit and they started to test me about bus routes. I became the "Bus Boy". Almost the whole cohot of express students in my batch know about me and my "wierd" interests.<br><br>Since this hobby might be "weird" to some  people, and some people my think you have no common interest with them, I think you gotta improve on your socializing skills. If you don't know how to socialize, you will lose many friends.<br><br>If you want to achieve something, be brave and fight for it. Don't hesitate or regret it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

They can spend one whole weekend in JB trying to conquer the golfcourse. Stay overnight and try to correct their mistake and re-do it again the next day. I find it a waste of money and boring. What's so nice about trying to get a ball so small into a slightly bigger hole in a big plot of land. But to my friend it is an attractive sports which trains and test an individual's patience and thinking capacity.<br><br>I enjoy motorsports. Riding my bike or drive my car in the race circuit. Going round and round trying to beat my previous lap with a faster timing, trying to overtake the next guy I can see at the same time prevent the guy behind from overtaking me. Some people find it stupid running around in circles. Wasting tyres and fuel trying to see who's faster. But I find that it is an attractive sport whereby one's endurance towards pressure &amp; capability to think in the midst of speed and pressure is brought to the test.<br><br>So everybody views beauty differently. One needs to fathom the beauty of the activity in order to appreciate it.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think my friends and schoolmates find the hobby alright. Many years ago they would ask why would bus and transport be so interesting, but after some time they know that its good to know more about their own transport system and follow. Some who do not have full interest in transport went on to do their own research and helped lots when they were doing projects. They also helped spread the message out and make some other of their friends interested in transport as a whole. Although they may not know as much as some of our folks here, they have their own share of knowledge, at least they do not have to rely on the taxi when getting around.<br>As for many folks here who may have the same experience, you are a roving transport guide. Friends and schoolmates ask you for directions and so on. If you gave them a good answer and details to the route they would definitely come back and ask again. This is a good way to know more people too; people are the best advertising tool. Many of my secondary schoolmates still contact me if they got lost or need to go somewhere quick but not giving the money to flag a cab.<br>I always find it good to spread the message out and tone down the general feeling that bus/transport lovers are nerdy and dumb, bad at studies and so on. This general feeling is definitely wrong; I have met local and overseas bus/transport enthusiasts who do not look dumb and nerdy at all. They just put their time wisely into their hobby, spend time with friends and family, and sometimes adopt another hobby to supplement the time and balance life.</div>
