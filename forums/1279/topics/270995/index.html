            <div class='col-md body'>You can't teach an old dog new tricks. So guess we just have to put up with some of their quirks. However, criticism is sometimes a camouflage for a lack of understanding of these senior citizens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I also hate it when old people seemingly have to talk in raised voices as if in a shouting match.... But I have since given them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they are doing so because they cannot hear each other very well........<br>Just try talking when you have music blasting into your ears as by earphones. When you cannot hear yourself, you tend to talk loudly too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Other than old people talking loudly, I don't claim to understand.
