              <p>Are you serious about 19 buses for 43?</p>
              <p>It's not about the number of DDs. 43 operates at a frequency of
              11-14 mins from 6.30 am to 7.00 am. 43 needs 1 fleet add.</p>
              <p>On service 43/43M, Citaro passenger hogs are quite common
              throughout the day. The Citaro is just 1-2 mins ahead of a DD. The
              Citaro usually has far more passengers than the DD behind.</p>

              <p>Error in calculation.. .should be 15 DDs, 6 SDs = 21 buses.</p>

              <p>Not surprised by yr comments. Firstly no cross border route are under BSEP. Secondly, 2storey queue is not a rare sight at JB customs especially during weekends, be it 160/170/170X, CWs, 950, AC7 etc.. Frequency of 170/170X is also much better than that of 950.(10 buses is considered little for 170/170X for 2 hours in fact). </p>
              <p>There are many causes for delays for cross borders route(not sure if yr cause is common). But sometimes when jams occur, BCs just skip trips or u-turn at JB customs in order to catch up with their subsequent ones, which may explain yr long wait.</p>

              <p>160 and 170 berth is right next to the custom, whereas 950 berth is across the road. Most people take 160 or 170. Only a few cross the road to take 950. It's easier to take 950 than to take 160 or 170.</p>
              <p>This probably explains why SBS5010P took 950 instead of 170.</p>
              <p>950 is like a insider's "privilege", where those who know that 950 easier to take can actually come back to Singapore faster. :)</p>

              <p>I believe the reason why the original poster wrote about bus 950 poor frequency at Johor Bahru custom is because he feels that public cross-boarder bus services like 950, especially 950, should get BSEP service enhancement.</p>
                  <p>but, really, if it's really traffic congestion, then how come only 950 affected? How come 170, 170* and 160 not affected?</p>
                  <p>I still think it's because SMRT not enough buses, so they have to take away buses from 950 and use them on mainland Singapore bus routes, and as a result 950 frequency is reduced.</p>
                  <p>if possible, they should relocate the 950 berth to next to 170, 170* and 160 berth. then next time everyone just take whichever bus comes. although the queue may be long, but with the capacity of buses per hour, everyone can get on the bus back to Singapore fast. :)</p>
                  <p>otherwise, maybe LTA should enhance bus service 950 by having BSEP buses in the fleet. I know cross-boarder bus services are special bus services, but... at least... at least try to move 950 berth to next to 160/170/170* berths. :)</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, I think your comment is invalid. You need to observe the departing frequency of smrt 950 at woodlands bus interchange in order to know its frequency. I observed before. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p><br>It just hapened that I was at Woodlands during evening peak (5.30-6.15pm) today.</p>
              <p>Did not realy take note of 950's timings, but IMHO its frequency is really quite bad... Maybe not as bad as 20 minutes, but definitely longer than 10 minutes.</p>
              <p>And every single bus leaving Woodlands Reg Int was packed to the door (even more packed than 911/912/913). Wonder how could people board at Marsiling.</p>
