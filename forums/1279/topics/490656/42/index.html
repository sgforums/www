              <p>Generally looping for longer services is a bad idea … might as
                  well extend it to the nearest interchange. (Unless your definition
                  of "looping" refers to a 123/131-ish style looping that doesn't
                  involve the loop as a directional endpoint)</p>
              <p>If it's BPJ MRT … fine if it would be amended to terminate at
                  BPJ ITH. But there's currently three services (177, 180, 983)
                  looping there. 979/M as well if you count the end loops. May result
                  in ITH space constraint problems. Couldn't recall any past services
                  that used to loop there though.</p>
              <p>If it's Hillview Rd … should extend to Bt Batok via 177
                  route.</p>
              <p>If it's Beauty World … seriously just merge it with 41, can work
                  out a service swap between TT and SMRT separately.</p>
              <p>If it's Keat Hong Close … what the heck. Better to extend to Bt
                  Gombak and Bt Batok to bridge the MRT link and relieve load on
                  existing BB north services. Provided no serious duplication with
                  187.</p>
              <p>Other looping points aren't visibly feasible.</p>

              <p>Option 1: Service 700 can be diverted via 171's route and another part of Dairy Farm Road. It provides connectivity along Hillview Station to Dairy Farm and Skywoods. 171 can be shortened to Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>Option 2: Service 67 can be diverted via Eng Neo Avenue, PIE, BKE, Bukit Panjang Road instead of Upper Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road/Bukit Timah Road. By right on this roads no one took 67. Then 171 can increase reliability with additional double decker or bendy buses.</p>

              <p>That is a huge change. LTA first should consider modifying 171 to operate Yishun - Bukit Timah Plaza. </p>
              <p>983 getting extended is far fetched as it acts like a feeder with 05-06 minutes frequency between BPJ - Keat Hong - CCK. </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><br> As part of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), Service 46
              was introduced in June this year to operate between Upper East
              Coast and Tampines via Bedok North Road and Tampines West. In
              addition to improving intertown connectivity between Tampines West
              and Bedok, the route has also been designed to link residents in
              both towns to their nearest upcoming Downtown Line (DTL) MRT
              Stations at Tampines West and Bedok Reservoir Stations along
              Tampines Avenue 4 and Bedok North Avenue 3 respectively. As such
              come 2017, commuters would also be able to make convenient bus-rail
              transfers at these stations to amenities such as the Tampines
              Avenue 3 neighbourhood centre, Bedok Stadium and the Bedok North
              Block 85 market/hawker centre.<br> <br></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">We have
              noted your suggestion to extend the route of Service 46 to connect
              the neighbourhoods around Tampines Street 32/34 and Street 45 with
              the DTL Tampines East Station along Tampines Avenue 7. The
              extension would lead to Service 46 converting to a long-distance
              loop service, potentially affecting overall service reliability for
              the entire route. As it is with the current bus network, residents
              in Tampines East are already be able to take existing Services 28,
              29, 291 and 293 to Tampines Bus Interchange for access to the DTL
              through Tampines Station. In view of the availability of existing
              travel options, LTA has no plans to extend the route of Service 46
              to Tampines East.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;"> <br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;"> <span style="font-size: medium; font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Notwithstanding
              the above, we would like to assure you that LTA is aware of the
              developments within Tampines Town and will take your suggestion
              into consideration in our ongoing review of the bus service network
              for Tampines Town.</span></p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, noted and thanks. Next few months will be very interesting days for public transport with Sengkang interchange expansion coming up, followed by bukit panjang ITH which was delayed for 1 yr. I personally don't like the current ideas of bus services departing bukit panjang with first stop as a bus stop. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, they should be settling it internally now. They will not divulge details as they don't want wash dirty linen in public. As compared to Changi business park terminal, it opens so much faster. News were released to public and bus services 47 and 118 were announced fast. Even service 20 stopping at one stop outside was announced very soon. So I was wondering why it took Sengkang interchange expansion so long. Normally they will announce very fast so as to tell the public that they are doing something for public transport. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Related to power supply? Cuz beside it is a walkway, bridge, escalator and bus stop - unlike the one at Tampines where it's all by itself. Assuming all take power from same network, the supply may not be enough to accomodate the load from the new facility without compromising the other loads/lines; need to upgrade the system - and this requires time and money....the one at Hougang, Punggol and East Coast may experience the same problem.</p>

              <p>Comments on new bus services 127 and 129:</p>
              <p>129 - the route damn unique. could have been just TPY to Jln Tentaram, but extending it to Tampines is a good idea. Can benefit Temasek Poly students living in Toa Payoh. :)</p>
              <p>127 - Route very similar to 72. Obviously for the upcoming Wafer labs. Loading will be similar to 256 - cui.</p>
