              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, what a disappointment to you too! I thought you read messages clearly. In my earlier messages, I have already said I predicted DDs for peak hours only. Please brush up your English first if you fail to interpret clear English messages. Cheers. Do that first before even attempting to shoot people and after that realizing that you did not read carefully! Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, that is the problem with you. Ask before you shoot. The words should read 'expect lots of crowds again at mall la'. The other wording should be 'not lots of paxes from edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end to take sbs 386 to go to future mall at oasis' That is always the situation with all the new malls/eateries in Punggol. This goes to show you did not take sbs 386 before and you just base on people words to anyhow shoot. What I observe is I walk the talk here. I find that you all understand the issue but you are just trying to engage in petty wars which I am not interested. I am also not talking to primary school students whom request word by word illustration.</p>
              <p>And please, don't use this type of lousy attitude to say I will say crowds from other area to cover up. Whatever I say, I don't twist. You are already a full grown adult. No need for such mindless arguments. Come on! Cheers. Thanks.  </p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, crowds from oasis Terraces mall comes from flats opposite oasis LRT, namely Punggol breeze bto, edgedale green bto, some older blocks near kadaloor LRT and some blocks further up at damai LRT and the few bto projects next to the mall. For those deep inside edgedale plains end and edgefield plains end, some will take sbs 386. Some will plainly just walk. </p>
              <p>The main crowd of sbs 386 comes from edgefield plains end to mrt and edgedale plains end to mrt. Because there is only this sbs 386 which goes all the way in and this is the only service. </p>
              <p>The demand of sbs 386 is mainly bto flats deep inside waterway to mrt and vice versa. Take the bus many times and you know straightaway. Mainly because only 1 bus service goes all the way in and loop out. Same scenario is expected for edgedale plains end. Why? Because only 1 bus service. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, in my earlier messages, I say a flicker of residents from edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end will take sbs 386 to oasis LRT in future once mall is up. Not crowds of people from that area taking sbs 386 to go oasis LRT. </p>
              <p>If you take sbs 386 before, you will know that the crowd is from mrt to edgefield plains end bus stop and vice versa. This will soon also apply for mrt to edgedale plains end and vice versa. Hope this is clear enough for you. </p>
              <p>If you doubt the point that the malls once up will be full of people, go check out the new waterway point or even the old Punggol plaza on weekends. See how much people go there even when the Punggol plaza is there after 12 years. Basically the amenities here are not much, causing people to flock to the malls. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this is a very good way for you to shift the topic. In my whole messages for sbs 386, I did not even contradict myself but you still write that I contradict. I did not get into fights with almost everyone but you still anyhow write. Wonderful way to alienate the issue. 2 people argue with me and you choose to equate 2 people with almost everybody??? What a joke! Anyway, most people also get into fights in this forum. See how those guys get into arguments for sbs 76/134 cases will know. That is much more worse and it is more than 2 people but it is still not almost everybody. </p>
              <p>For me, I only predict sbs 386 to get a few DDs and just because you misinterpret it, others start to get the ball rolling. You are really one kind of a guy. You start everything by saying I am a huge disappointment when you are the one who misinterpret. Now you still have the audacity to come here and tell people that I argue with almost everyone? Damn childish! Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes the mall is under construction since mid June 2015 and is slated for completion in Q4 2017/Q1 2018. The polyclinic may open first. The mall is named oasis terraces. This is so called the neighbourhood mall for edgefield and edgedale plus many others living along Punggol drive. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Expects lots of crowds again</span></strong> and it is pity there are only sbs 50 and sbs 386 serving this mall. It is also a pity that one feeder bus service sbs 386 is expected to serve so many areas inside Punggol east. However it is also good that it connects many areas that well using 1 bus service.

              <p>If 811 were to get DDs, will 812, 806 get the DDs as well?</p>
              <p>However, two things remains, the lack of DDs and the WAB waves.</p>

              <p>More A95s are coming so don't worry<br><br>The issue is that it's totally hopeless to deploy DD on feeder/intratown/psuedo-feeder services (aka 962, 964, 860, etc)<br><br>SMRT is just mindlessly WAB-ing services which they don't even have the proper buses for. SBST has DD successfully on feeder/townlink services because they're deployed on those services for years now. No one wants to go upstairs for a few stops. Less said for the elderly who does frequent feeder services as well.<br><br></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From my point of view is LTA that encourage them to use DDs for feeders/Intratowns till the concept buses is finalise and put into production stage.They can start with 811,812,903,911,912 &amp; 913 for the pioneer project and subsequently to other feeders/Intratowns.More and less they can utilise the A24s that have left those service mentioned above that use DDs thus they can early retire they non WAB bendy buses.It will take times for SMRT controlled area commuters to get used to DDs for their feeders/Intratowns but its not impossible too.I rather they deploy those A95s rather than they spammed with A22s which in return cost manpower and fuel usage.</p></div>
