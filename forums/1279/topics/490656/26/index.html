              latest round of BSEP for Q2 2016 is announced. Implementation date
              is 24 April 2016. Affected services are sbs 117 and sbs 386, both
              Punggol bus services.</span></p>

              117 is amended to ply west camp road instead of seletar west link.
              This provides coverage to youth flying club and ST airport
              services.</span></p>

              386 is extended further up to edgedale plains end, with the same
              type of loop at 2 bus stops (1 stop going to Punggol mrt, 1 stop to
              Punggol east). It will continue to loop at Punggol east/central
              (Blk 162B bus stop) and serve all other bus stops. This will
              benefit waterway view and sundew residents. </span></p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, half congrats as you expect it to skip the bus stop outside greendale primary school (edgedale plains). The edgefield plains end to Punggol field/east/central is an important link. Expect sbs 386 to have double decker buses at peak hours only very soon once the edgedale plains end (waterway sundew residents) are in. Crowds will come in real fast. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Never expected it to miss any stops. I just expected that 386 would do Punggol Dr &gt;&gt; Edgedale Plains (end) and then continue to Punggol Plaza and back to Edgedale Plains (end) &gt;&gt; Punggol Dr &gt;&gt; Edgefield Plains (end) before heading back to Punggol MRT.</p>
              <p>Your response instead was that because of road structure, you expected the Waterway Sundew residents at Edgedale Plains (end) to walk all the way to Oasis/Kadaloor LRT on Punggol Dr which is so far away.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, that was because there is no space at Punggol interchange already and I had wanted a new feeder bus service to cover edgedale plains end instead of extending sbs 386. </p>
              <p>In the much earlier discussion way before this proposal, you also proposed sbs 386 to miss out the bus stop outside greendale primary school and I also say LTA will not purposely build a bus stop and introduce sbs 386 the only bus and then take it out without any replacement.

              <p>To add on, with no disrespect to you, you also say in the beginning that the extension from edgefield plains end to Punggol plaza/field/east/central is not necessary as the loading does not justify it. It should have remained as Punggol int to edgefield plains end. Only I keep saying that the linkage is important as it provides a new direct link. </p>
              <p>Now the authorities not only justify it by linking edgefield plains end to Punggol field/east/central loop, it double justifies it by linking edgedale plains end to Punggol field/east/central loop as well. It could well have totally removed this direct link this time round. However it did not. Well done to LTA. Make me so happy today. Cheers.</p>

              <p>To add on, with no disrespect to you, you also say in the
                  beginning that the extension from edgefield plains end to Punggol
                  plaza/field/east/central is not necessary as the loading does not
                  justify it. It should have remained as Punggol int to edgefield
                  plains end. Only I keep saying that the linkage is important as it
                  provides a new direct link. </p>
              <p>Now the authorities not only justify it by linking edgefield
                  plains end to Punggol field/east/central loop, it double justifies
                  it by linking edgedale plains end to Punggol field/east/central
                  loop as well. It could well have totally removed this direct link
                  this time round. However it did not. Well done to LTA. Make me so
                  happy today. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Once implemented they cannot remove the link. There is also no denying of the fact that the loading remains dismissal between Edgefield Plains (end) and Punggol Plaza in the range of 10-15 pax at the most.</p>
              <p>Now with Edgedale Plains (end) coming up, loading should improve a bit for Punggol Plaza and transfer to other trunk services.</p>
