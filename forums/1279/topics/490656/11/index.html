              <p><strong>151:</strong> Got DD-&gt; SD downgrade, no fleet add.
              Has many alternatives along its route, but recently loading has
              picked up quite a bit between Macpherson and Hougang that could
              warrant an upgrade.</p>
              <p><strong>153:</strong> Still operating with same # DDs/SDs.
              Current fleet managing load well</p>
              <p><strong>156:</strong> Current fleet managing load well. 156
              loading has tanked over the years, and 156A also was stopped</p>
              <p><strong>160:</strong> JB service. Horrible frequency.
              Definitely deserves fleet add.</p>
              <p><strong>166:</strong> got capacity downgrade from DD-&gt;SD (at
              least 4 slots in last 3 years). Loading on 166 has dropped over the
              years.</p>
              <p><strong>173:</strong> no fleet add/upgrade. Maybe now with DTL2,
              might get but will depend on loading</p>
              <p><strong>174:</strong> urrent fleet managing the loading well. I
              am not 100% sure if it got SD-&gt;DD in last 3 years? Someone can
              confirm.</p>
              <p><strong>177:</strong> thought this will get converted to full
              day service under BSEP or get extended to YT but did not happen</p>
              <p><strong>179:</strong> already operating with 27-28 buses with
              full fleet DD</p>
              <p><strong>180:</strong> already operating full fleet bendy</p>
              <p><strong>184:</strong> surprisingly this one hasn't got fleet add
              or upgrade unlike its other SIM/Clementi counterparts like
              52/154</p>
              <p><strong>197:</strong> current fleet doing well. 197's loading
              depends a lot on other services such as 7 bet Guillemard and Bugis,
              147 between China Town and Bukit Merah, 14 between Bukit Merah and

              <p>BSEP new bus service 258 has problem with schedule adherence. Just now, I waited for 258 at Boon Lay Bus Interchange. The wait was quite long. The queue line went from long to short to long, as bus service 243G arrives. Finally, the bus 258 arrived, at 8:15pm.

                      <p>Clearly, bus service 258 has problem with schedule adherence. I hope someone can help me inform the time keeper at Joo Koon/Boon Lay Bus Interchange about it.</p>

The loading is low (only a few cats in the lower deck) during regular hours and the loading is very high (up to half of upper deck occupied) during peak hours (up to around 8pm). I am sure the LTA knows exactly which are the hours the bus service has very high loading. I hope the pattern has been consistent enough over the past fifty three days, to deem it necessary for bus service enhancements (increase frequency) during the periods of very high loading.</p>
