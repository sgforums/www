                  <p>I disagree with the first point. By making 192 plying the route
                  of 258, there are definitely going to be serious problems. It is
                  somehow difficult to explain, but I do not think that as a trunk
                  service, 192 should ply the route like a feeder hybrid. Trunks are
                  meant to provide direct connections from one area to another while
                  feeders bring people from residential estates to the nearest MRT
                  stations/bus interchange. Furthermore, the distance is going to
                  increase, as well as the frequency and number of buses in its
                  fleet. I do not think this can be explained away by the fact that
                  the demand between Jurong West and Fairprice Hub is low.</p>

                  <p>Actually, 258 is a Jurong-Industrial Bus Service. Like 192, by right, 258 is meant to serve the industrial areas. So, I think it would be appropriate to merge 258 with 192.</p>

              <p>With regards to this reply, although my opinions are way before 258 is introduced, but I guess this still applies depending on which number are you using for the merged service...if you are retaining 192 as the number, my stand still remains that as a trunk service, it ought to bring direct connections and not winding around Jurong West neighbourhoods with many turns. If you are retaining 258 as the number, it would have garnered my support otherwise.</p>

                      <p>I guess 181 was never meant for industrial areas. The original intention was probably to extend it further to the then-proposed new roads. That was when the entire Wenya/Bulim area was only for residential uses.</p>
                      <p>Plans have changed. Now the only reason why 181 should be extended is simply to connect JW residents to Street 23/24, or otherwise to Boon Lay or Taman Jurong. That's all.</p>
                      <p>Anyway, I do not think 181 will ever be extended to an industrial area. </p>

              <p><strong>BSEP Bus Service 258 - Joo Koon to Boon Lay (loop)</strong></p>
                                                                  <p>It has been six days since the BSEP bus service 258 was introduced. At the section between Joo Koon Bus Interchange and Jurong West Street 61/71/81, the loading has been increasing every day, and it is still increasing, as more Jurong West residents are aware of this new bus service.</p>
                                                                  <p>For the section between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Jurong West Street 81/71/61, I feel that there is the potential to make the BSEP bus service 258 more useful. Rather than let the BSEP bus service 258 duplicate bus services 243G and 243W, I think it is better to let it go into neighbourhood 7, by plying Jurong West Street 72.</p>
                                                                   <p>I notice that many Jurong West residents who take bus along Jurong West Street 75 actually stay along Jurong West Street 72. They probably take bus at Jurong West Street 75 because they feel that this is a faster way to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, as compared to taking bus service 242. Although there is bus service 193 at Jurong West Avenue 4, the frequency is long.</p>
                                                                  <p>We could amend the route of the BSEP bus service 258 to ply Jurong West Avenue 4 and Street 72, before continuing on from Jurong West Street 82 - Skipping the entire stretch of Jurong West Street 75.</p>
                                           <p>By doing so, it would enhance the accessibility to bus services for Jurong West residents who stay along Jurong West Street 72. It could reduce waiting times for a direct bus service to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, from Jurong West Avenue 4. More importantly, it could be a more effective way to reduce the very high loadings on bus services 243G and 243W along Jurong West Street 75. This would also enable the BSEP bus service 258 to complement bus service 242, which sometimes has high loadings.</p>
                                                                  <p>Meanwhile, by plying Jurong West Street 72, 81 and 61, it would further enhance the intra-town bus connection within Jurong West Extension town (Gek Poh and Pioneer), which has already been enhanced with the introduction of the BSEP bus service 258.</p>
                                                                  <p>Ultimately, it is the money that matters. If we amend the route of the BSEP bus service 258 to ply Jurong West Street 72, more Jurong West residents would benefit and there would be higher loadings on the BSEP bus service 258. With higher loadings, more revenue could be collected. :)</p>

              <p>Nowadays, the topics are all quite intertwined. Even at other
              topics (not route suggestions) also suddenly have routes being
              suggested. So I believe this is due to the nature of the topics
              being discussed. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, yes i knew long time ago already. Some topics are just too close to call. For example, LTA bus service enhancement program part 4 is so close to new bus services announced by LTA. There is a need to consolidate similar topics, seriously. Or else you see posts being switched between similar topics and separate discussions for same issue. Due to this reason, we really cannot prevent cases of people writing in topics deemed not the most appropriate. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
