            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that the LTA is very smart to use the name "Eunos", instead of names like "Geylang" and "Bedok", to refer to the area that would get new bus service. "Eunos" is not the name of any sub-zone or of any planning area. As they never specify exactly where the new bus service would go, the new bus service can go to anywhere that can be associated to the name "Eunos". In other words, as of that time when the news article was published, they probably had not decided on the route of the bus service. (Unless, they are referring to the roads with "Eunos" in the name, that the new bus service would ply)</div>

              <p>First 68 &amp; 76, then 13, and now 76, 134 and potentially a 68 thrown in as well. LTA is really trying to throw us off. </p>
              <p>If it's a Go-Ahead service with the number 68, is it safe to say it is a Pasir Ris/CBP service? A Pasir Ris &lt;&gt; CBP link is plausible or a Eunos &lt;&gt; CBP link via Chai Chee/Bedok North.</p>
              <p>Thinking off the back of my head</p>

              <p>Any chance it will be a UEC service and serve Marine Parade? UEC is relatively close to CBP, so a Loyang-based fleet is possible, but the depot would be a bit far compared to BNDP/Changi Bus Pk. Could this explain an amendment to 13? </p>

              <p>Same sentiment. This new 68 is not one of the unknown feeder routes, so one of the trunk services will have to go from the package. </p>

              <p>Yes, I remember. But it was many years back when 42 was condemned to Darts running every 20 mins. The area has become a lot more populated since. Now a 12m SD can be packed to the door during peak hours along Lengkong 3/4, operating at 8-12 min intervals. Unfortunately, the area is largely private housing with about 10 HDB blocks, so it is not the usual candidate for a new BSEP service in LTA's mind. Now with LTA planning, there is a politcial angle as well so obviously areas that are perceived to be more needy are given priority. The other similar area is Joo Chiat which has poor MRT connections and few services. </p>
              <p>I think it will eventually come. LTA seems to be shoring up missing connections to Marine Parade. First in Bedok South with 47, and now with 134 in Sims Pl/Geylang East Central. It is a positive trend and I hope that once HDB estates are given access, LTA will also look into connections in the private housing estates. After all, other BSEP services like 4, 41 and 122 serve a much higher proportion of private housing than other BSEP services. </p>

              <p>Yew Tee is now okay with 979 introduced + 302/307 and MRT. It is an old estate with no new developments.</p>
              <p>117 is NOT a joke. It is actually picking up well. Especially towards latter half of 2016 you can expect it to get huge loading. Also the SAP - Punggol sector is getting good traction. I am happy it didn't connect Chong Pang (already too many services) and instead will connect to Canberra future town, which is not too far away. </p>
              <p>Pioneer - really? where? </p>
              <p>Haig road - have you seen the road from Geylang Serai to Dunman? It is too narrow for buses. The part from Dunman to Mountbatten okay.</p>

              <p>It is not out of the realm to think or to ask for a new service for Kembangan to Marine Parade. Kembangan/Changi Rd area have a lot of condos and about 10++ HDB blocks, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">about the same condo population as Flora Dr</span></strong>. So there should be demand considering that it's a new connection. Marine Parade boasts many nearby schools plus many shopping options. My main source of demand is not Frankel/Opera. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But might as well use Frankel to reach Marine Parade since it is the fastest connection? Too many services for Frankel because it duplicates 32 you might say. Simple. Re-route 32 to Telok Kurau Rd. It is a supplementary service, so it can supplement 15 &amp; 155. It should not be the sole service for Frankel Av. Even though 42 duplicates 32 to Kembangan MRT, it is only a one-way connection. No. of services to Kembangan  - 2 vs no. of services from Kembangan MRT - 0. Stupid right! So, you kill two-birds with one stone - you fix the problem of poor MRT access on Frankel Av, plus you provide a new Kembangan-Marine Parade sector. </span></p>
