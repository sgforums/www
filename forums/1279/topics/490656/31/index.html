              <p>If lets say LTA buys bendies, then the operators will have to accept them, no matter what. Its the same case as now, whatever buses (SDs or DDs) they buy, or depots or interchanges they build, the operator will have to accept it. Same thing that has happened to London, operators had to accept the Citaro bendies then, and the NBfL now. If bus operators can't accept or can't adapt, then its their own loss.</p>

              <p>Looking at the modern infrastructure of new interchanges,Do you still think LTA will buy bendies?Be honest with me.London already had ditch the bendies due to spacing and the road condition of the country thus they banned bendies.Only a few left mostly for Airport shuttle.If LTA keen on bendies they would have funded SMRT already and need not open tender for the three door concept DDs.</p>

              <p>This issue you are discussing (bus interchange design) is separate from the issue you were discussing (a hypothetical situation which you already had said "if" in it). I was just answering the "if" scenairo you brought up, which is simply that if LTA decides to buy bendies, the operators have no choice but to accept, and in fact it is true for whatever buses they buy.</p>

              <p>Yes with their depot capacity and LTA added buses..else why they request to park their buses at Bulim and Loyang respectively?No need to think so much about bendies,I got a strong feeling that SMRT will lose Yishun as well and those Amdep A24s can transfer to Woodlands feeders/Intratowns already.If really LTA funded a bit more A24s,I am the first one very happy if they get some for GA and use for svc like 359 &amp; 386.</p>

              <p>I thought the answer is already posted above so no issue
                              here..Look dude im not againts any bendy buses goes to any
                              operators or what..But seriously there is always a reason why there
                              is only 40 units of A24.Period and please get on with the topic
                              rather <strong>than discussing about if here if there bendy here bendy

              <p>The<strong> bolded</strong> part is the exact same thing that I have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT </span></strong>discussed on. You were the one who kept talking about the feasibility of bendy buses when I did not touch on that at all.</p>
              <p>My point is, if LTA decides to buy (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT</strong></span> that they will buy or whether it is good or bad to buy, I repeat <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong>) bendy buses. The operators will just have to accept it, and train their staff for it, as with any other bus they receive.</p>
              <p>My side of the discussion on this page of this thread has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never </span></strong>been on bendies themselves, but on the obligations of both bus companies and the authorities in a GCM landscape regarding bus assets, and it applies to all types of buses, as mentioned in the first post of this page.</p>

              <p>But seriously,Other operators has the right to reject bendy buses if they arent keen on it.Unless die2,LTA says they have to use it if they want the contract but until now there is no rules or regulations that TT or GA must also bendies if they win SMRT routes.This issue we had already discussed in meetings with LTA months ago..Someone brought it up and LTA themselves had no intention to buy bendies unless they have plans for that in future.They were merely discussed on the feasibility of the three doors DDs to us only.I understood what you meant,No worries no wrong or right here.</p>
