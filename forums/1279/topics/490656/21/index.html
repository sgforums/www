                           <p>You should look at the number of units in the BTO projects I listed here. All have at least close to five hundred units. Some have around five hundred to one thousand units. Some have more than one thousand units. For example, the upcoming BTOs at Woodlands have a combined number of around one thousand five hundred to two thousand units.</p> <p>I think once a BTO project (or a cluster of BTO projects) has a certain number of units, say around five hundred, we should have at least one BSEP new bus service for it (or for that cluster).</p>
                              <p>Actually, what's the ratio like for number of units to one bus service? There is probably a standard, like roughly how many units to one bus service.</p>
                              <p>If anyone here knows the ratio, it would be good if he can share it here.</p>
                              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>because if you look at the recent new yishun feeder 805, there's like around 4,881 not-yet-completed units of BTO flats along Yishun Avenue 4 and Avenue 1.</p>
              <p>in fact, with 4,881 units, I guess one new feeder alone is not enough. in future, we may need another new bus service for that area.</p>
              <p>whereas at Jurong West (Lakeside), there's like around 2,723 new units coming up next year and the year after in Boon Lay, Hong Kah and Taman Jurong...so, I think we need like one new bus service there eventually.</p>
              <p>so, that's like around six confirmed areas that will sure have new BSEP bus services: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Admiralty</span></strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Buangkok</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sembawang</strong></span>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Matilda</span></strong>, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Lakeside</span></strong> - and probably <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yishun</strong></span> also.</p>

              <p>I agree. Can add buses if required. But flats which do not have connectivity should be given priority for new service or service modification. Always new service also not required. Can just modify some existing service if required. </p>
              <p>I think Keat Hong area will be fine with 301, 983, 172. In future, I do hope 700 is extended to CCK via Keat Hong, given that 700 loading has dropped, and this will provide direct Orchard/City connection for Keat Hong residents.</p>

              <p>Don't think so much in future. First lets concentrate on current year.</p>
              <p>805 is running empty buses as most BTO flats not open. Same for 117 that almost goes express along ave 1 except for 1-2 bus stops as there is no loading today.</p>
              <p>First let these two services get utilized well, then we can think of whether a third service is required.</p>

              <p>in fact, another up and coming area is Bukit Batok West. in year 2017 alone, there will be like 2,073 new units completed. one year later, in 2018, another 3,165 new units. but that's next year and the year after.</p>
                                              <p>what's certain is that there's like around six areas that confirm will have new bus service, namely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Admiralty</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buangkok</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bukit Batok West</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Matilda</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sembawang</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yishun</span> - and probably also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong West Lakeside</span>, if BSEP 49 is not enough.</p>
                                              <p>what i am doing now is to merely speculate where the final twenty BSEP new bus services will be at.</p>
                                  <p>so, yeah, so far out of twenty i already speculate like six areas that are very likely to have at least one of the final twenty new services.</p>
                              <p>but, from the number of new BTO units this year and next year, it is quite unlikely that all twenty upcoming new services would be for the new BTOs... at most around ten only.</p>
                              <p>whereas for the other ten, I guess it is at matured areas... like BSEP 150/134... to enhance bus services and/or break up very long routes that do not need to be so long.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I think what mr carbikebus means is not this. What he implies is those kids who have richer parents will have their time to success shortened by about 15-20 years compared to those kids who have poorer parents. In other words, those with poorer family background will take much longer time (even count into decades) to reach on an equal footing with those who have richer parents. This is only for those luckier ones. Some may end up striving so hard and yet still lose out. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
