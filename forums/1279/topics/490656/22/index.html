              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I think what mr carbikebus means is not this.
              What he implies is those kids who have richer parents will have
              their time to success shortened by about 15-20 years compared to
              those kids who have poorer parents. In other words, those with
              poorer family background will take much longer time (even count
              into decades) to reach on an equal footing with those who have
              richer parents. This is only for those luckier ones. Some may end
              up striving so hard and yet still lose out. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>erm... I don't advise giving the best for our children, as that would only feed them until they become adults. Imagine what happens if their life has been a bed of roses, then suddenly when they start working they get a shock of how tough life really is.</p>
              <p>instead, we should let them learn the hard way. don't clean up their own shit or give them unfair help, otherwise they won't learn. teach them how to live their lives and be successful, then when they grow up, they will be successful adults.</p>
              <p>that's what I'm going to do when I have children. I will give them the best, obviously, since they are my blood and meat. I want the best of them. but, after a certain age, I will start to let go and let them live their life on their own, while I guide them. because I know I will not be there for them forever...</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6853S, the forum is for everybody to comment. If you do not like what I say, you are free to ignore me. Do not use such a lousy tone and assume that you know everything. Even if you talk to the MP and authorities, what is the big deal? It does not give you a full right to stop what I have been observing. All of us have a basic right to talk our mind. </p>
              <p>A big thumbs down to your lousy attitude. By the way, I cannot see sbs 76 being reinstated in any sense. Hope you prove me wrong then just by talking to the authorities. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Unless there is high demand between Marine Crescent and Upp Paya Lebar/Serangoon/AMK all of a sudden to warrant a return of 76, its reinstatement will not happen. An extension of 150 up to Serangoon is possible so that at the very least Tai Seng has a direct connection to Marine Crescent.

But in that case, you may need to scale down capactiy as the Paya Lebar to Marine Parade sector will be shared amongst four services (43, 76, 134 and 135). </span></p>
              <p>But, the main objective in this whole saga was to improve the connection to Paya Lebar and Parkway Parade.

              you take NSL from Gombak to CBD ah? You take NSL/NEL then you know.
              Worse still, Bt Gombak does not have direct link to places like Sungei Kadut and Science Pk.
