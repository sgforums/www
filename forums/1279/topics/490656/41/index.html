              <p>Problem is whether 171 route (YIS-BPJ) is DD friendly and whether it could run on high capacity buses with as high a frequency as 983. Based on current stats it doesn't look like a 171-983 marriage would endure.</p>

As it is with the current bus network, residents in Tampines East are already be able to take existing Services 28, 29, 291 and 293 to Tampines Bus Interchange for access to the DTL through Tampines Station.

              noted your suggestion to extend the route of Service 46 to connect
              the neighbourhoods around Tampines Street 32/34 and Street 45 with
              the DTL Tampines East Station along Tampines Avenue 7. The
              extension would lead to Service 46 converting to a long-distance
              loop service, potentially affecting overall service reliability for
              the entire route. As it is with the current bus network, residents
              in Tampines East are already be able to take existing Services 28,
              29, 291 and 293 to Tampines Bus Interchange for access to the DTL
              through Tampines Station. In view of the availability of existing
              travel options, LTA has no plans to extend the route of Service 46
              to Tampines East.</span><br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;">

              <p>Generally looping for longer services is a bad idea … might as well extend it to the nearest interchange. (Unless your definition of "looping" refers to a 123/131-ish style looping that doesn't involve the loop as a directional endpoint)</p>
              <p>If it's BPJ MRT … fine if it would be amended to terminate at BPJ ITH. But there's currently three services (177, 180, 983) looping there. 979/M as well if you count the end loops. May result in ITH space constraint problems. Couldn't recall any past services that used to loop there though.</p>
              <p>If it's Hillview Rd … should extend to Bt Batok via 177 route.</p>
              <p>If it's Beauty World … seriously just merge it with 41, can work out a service swap between TT and SMRT separately.</p>
              <p>If it's Keat Hong Close … what the heck. Better to extend to Bt Gombak and Bt Batok to bridge the MRT link and relieve load on existing BB north services. Provided no serious duplication with 187.</p>
              <p>Other looping points aren't visibly feasible.</p>
