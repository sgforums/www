              <p>Buses that never received fleet upgrade/add after BSEP was
                          launched (+3 years now)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-50</span></strong></p>
              <p>9 - there was capacity add + upgrades on both sv 19/89 doing
                          Changi Cargo but none on sv 9.</p>
              <p>16 - after Dakota MRT, loading dropped drastically between
                          Orchard and Dunman road. Current fleet is able to manage loading
                          well, hence agree no add required. </p>
              <p>18 - this service operates at 18-20 minutes frequency. It is
                          just a back up service there with limited resources. </p>
              <p>24 - surprisingly this  Changi Airport service has not
                          received fleet add for years now. I think it could be because of
                          parallelism with MRT + other services along the route that have not
                          substantiated the need</p>
              <p>26 - this service actually has pretty decent loading between
                          Geylang and Toa Payoh, but somehow has not got any add/upgrade</p>
              <p>27 - due to lack of DDs, already 32 buses had been added by SBST
                          managing the load well. Hence. But 27 really needed DDs. LTA
                          answered with 118.</p>
              <p>30 - surprisingly this heavy loading service got no
                          upgrade/fleet add. Have to say SBST has done a good job maintaining
                          the frequency/loading on sv 30</p>
              <p>32 - lol. no need. just a back up service. surprisingly even
                          after the Margaret Dr HDBs in Queenstown, both 32 and 122 haven't
                          really picked up its loading. Is it that the occupancy at those
                          HDBs still remains v low?</p>
              <p>37 - this service had received DD upgrades just before BSEP was
                          introduced. Having said this I do feel the lone KUB also needs to
                          be converted to DD slot. There is crash loading on this service and
                          needs to be treated like JIS - full fleet DD. The KUB cannot tank
                          the load. Also, sv 4 has relieved loading on sv 37 to some
                          extent. </p>
              <p>38 - needs fleet reduction, if any!!</p>
              <p>41 - since launched, no add/upgrade and not required. Actually
                          DD--&gt;SD should be done, and fleet add with Citaro as frequency
                          is around 12-15 mins. Fleet should look like 6 SDs, 2 DDs.</p>

              <p>Service 7 had fleet upgrades after BSEP was launched, but not under BSEP. Does this service count in your list, or have you missed it out?</p>

              <p>I agree with this. 20 and 38 follow similar routes in the sense
              that they both detour off Simei Rd (via St 4, St 3, St 1) then back
              onto Simei Rd.  And I know of cases where residents prefer 20
              because 1) the buses are newer and “better/high quality” (yes I
              have literally heard them say that) due to full BSEP fleet, though
              this remains to be seen due to the addition of Scania perms and 2)
              shorter route to Tampines Interchange.</p>

              <p>i live on serv 20 route and not so far from serv 38 also. i take serv 20 many time to simei. freq is very good now and lot of buses. i dun see 38 full but serve imp need to connect tamp cc to simei st 1 inside hdb. serv 20 load quite good from tamp to simei also. not just cbp.</p>

              <p>I agree!!! I favourite Svc 24 everytime to go back last time if I was from Airport to go to AMK... Heavy loading one most of the time... Even travelling towards Airport loading good...</p>
              <p>Need 2 fleet addition or maybe at least 4 fleet addition... But then AMK Interchange needs to have parking to accomodate (if fleet addition, frequency must be good also)</p>

                  around JE/West Coast. Multiple reasons</p>

                  luxury on this service.</p>

                  SD--&gt;DD upgrade or fleet add as the loading was +100 from Upper
                  Serangoon in AM. With 102 and 324 introduction, loading on 62 has
                  been tamed with these introductions. Current fleet doing okay.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px; color: #000000; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; line-height: 19.696px;"><strong>64</strong> - current fleet doing okay. Seems like the
                  Queenstown HDBs along Sterling have gone down in occupancy given
                  they are very old. On other part of its route it duplicates
                  65/66/139 too much</p>

                  -&gt; 1 SD. No more full fleet DD. Again mutliple services plying
                  the same route is the reason. Yet I would prefer 65 to be full
                  fleet DD because there are parts of the route you cannot predict
                  that will get  80+ pax. For those who are interested, these
                  are the high loading sectors:</p>

                  Reason same; multiple services in parallel. Now DTL2 also.</p>

                  loading. Its lone DD AM crossover also stopped in end 2014. In turn
                  94 got 2 DDs.</p>

                  no fleet add/upgrade</p>

              <p>Thats not really true. Sure, the loading may be on the undesirable side, but not to the extent of "absolutely terrible". If anything, this svc suffers low loading due to its horrible freq. </p>
              <p>At Tampines, this svc gets pretty decent loading from the int and at the lib. At N2 market ppl also board given it comes before 9/12. Also, Bedok South to TM, also got crush loading at times. </p>
              <p>One SD is not too much to ask for. It helps boost freq significantly while not using resources unwisely.</p>

              <p>The problem with 24 lies not in the fact it has too little buses, but in the fact the route is too damn long and buses from AMK gets stuck in traffic so much in the eastern end it is a miracle for buses not to bunch and for pax not to wait 10+ mins during PM peak. Adding buses will not only not solve the problem, but cause these buses to join the mayhem as well. In essense it is pouring resources in the sea. </p>

              <p><strong>111</strong> - got capacity downgrade with DD-&gt;SD. This happened 2 years back. sv 111 loading has improved again given Queenstown development. Maybe time to get the SD-&gt;DD back</p>

Having said this, I haven't seen 112 bursting and current fleet is able to manage the load. Is it that HG Ave 7 HDBs have less flats or less occupancy. Not sure!?</p>
              <p><strong>113</strong> - ha ha! the service that used to be much in discussion few years back until the 2 users realized there is no point speaking about it. Poorly planned route and disastrous frequency.</p>
              <p><strong>116</strong> - not sure if this one should be counted. It got downgrade from 7 buses to 6 and then got that bus back to fleet of 7 buses. I would not say the fleet add was because of better loading but more because the frequency was horrible at 20 mins. Now with 7 buses is around 15 mins. Somehow 3 years after also, 116 loading remains not so great. Poor route planning.</p>
              <p><strong>120</strong> - since launched, 8 buses and guess it will stay there for a long time, unless 120 route gets modified/extended. loading is okay at some sector, totally manageable by current fleet. </p>
              <p><strong>121</strong> - no fleet add since launch, 121 does pretty well between Tiong Bahru and Tehlok Blangah, but for a shorter route sports 8 buses and has decent frequency. </p>
              <p><strong>122</strong> - since launched early this year, no fleet add. Frequency kind of sucks at 15-20 mins, but the loading has failed to pick up. Most of the buses peak loading is at 20 pax. </p>
              <p><strong>132</strong> - no fleet add/upgrade. current fleet is doing well + alternatives such as 145 and 165/166 in its high loading sectors helps managing the load.</p>
              <p><strong>135 </strong>- current fleet managing load well. some how the routing is such that between amk and paya lebar loading remains around 30-40 pax. Paya Lebar-Marine Parade depends totally on 43, 76 arrival times.</p>
              <p><strong>136 </strong>- no fleet add/upgrade. There were few months when loading increases when Upp Serangoon flats were launched and people took 136 to Kovan. I even thought would make sense to launch 136A but then with 324 and 102 coming, 136 has gone down the priority order again. In fact, sv 22 crossover DDs could be changed to SD already!</p>
              <p><strong>140</strong> - guess it has its fair share of buses already. 4 buses for the route it serves is good enough. 140 is a sweet short trunk meeting unique commuter needs.</p>
              <p><strong>141</strong> - this is another unique route launched under BSEP. For some reason, loading has been below my expectations. I thought 141 would get higher loading, given it serves Farrer Estate and cuts across NSL-CCL-EWL.</p>
              <p><strong>142</strong> - this one's been a bit of a surprise. Operating with 5 buses ever since launch. It deserves a fleet add, especially when it is only service catering to Potong Pasir HDB estate. It does role more of a feeder.</p>

              <p>142 - I don't think it can be seen as just a feeder in Potong Pasir. Much loading comes between Toa Payoh and Potong Pasir MRT. Yes there are commuters boarding 142 at Potong Pasir MRT into the estate itself, but after MRT the bus usually has less pax than before MRT (I mean for PM Peak). That's just my observation.</p>

              <p><strong>111</strong> - got capacity downgrade with DD-&gt;SD.
              This happened 2 years back. sv 111 loading has improved again given
              Queenstown development. Maybe time to get the SD-&gt;DD back</p>
              <p><strong>112</strong> - no fleet add even though route is v
              unique and offers less alternatives throughout its entire route.
              Note it also acts as feeder for HG Ave 7. Having said this, I
              haven't seen 112 bursting and current fleet is able to manage the
              load. Is it that HG Ave 7 HDBs have less flats or less occupancy.
              Not sure!?</p>
              <p><strong>113</strong> - ha ha! the service that used to be much
              in discussion few years back until the 2 users realized there is no
              point speaking about it. Poorly planned route and disastrous
              frequency.</p>
              <p><strong>116</strong> - not sure if this one should be counted.
              It got downgrade from 7 buses to 6 and then got that bus back to
              fleet of 7 buses. I would not say the fleet add was because of
              better loading but more because the frequency was horrible at 20
              mins. Now with 7 buses is around 15 mins. Somehow 3 years after
              also, 116 loading remains not so great. Poor route planning.</p>
              <p><strong>120</strong> - since launched, 8 buses and guess it will
              stay there for a long time, unless 120 route gets
              modified/extended. loading is okay at some sector, totally
              manageable by current fleet. </p>
              <p><strong>121</strong> - no fleet add since launch, 121 does
              pretty well between Tiong Bahru and Tehlok Blangah, but for a
              shorter route sports 8 buses and has decent frequency. </p>
              <p><strong>122</strong> - since launched early this year, no fleet
              add. Frequency kind of sucks at 15-20 mins, but the loading has
              failed to pick up. Most of the buses peak loading is at 20
              pax. </p>
              <p><strong>132</strong> - no fleet add/upgrade. current fleet is
              doing well + alternatives such as 145 and 165/166 in its high
              loading sectors helps managing the load.</p>
              <p><strong>135</strong> - current fleet managing load well. some
              how the routing is such that between amk and paya lebar loading
              remains around 30-40 pax. Paya Lebar-Marine Parade depends totally
              on 43, 76 arrival times.</p>
              <p><strong>136</strong> - no fleet add/upgrade. There were few
              months when loading increases when Upp Serangoon flats were
              launched and people took 136 to Kovan. I even thought would make
              sense to launch 136A but then with 324 and 102 coming, 136 has gone
              down the priority order again. In fact, sv 22 crossover DDs could
              be changed to SD already!</p>
              <p><strong>140</strong> - guess it has its fair share of buses
              already. 4 buses for the route it serves is good enough. 140 is a
              sweet short trunk meeting unique commuter needs.</p>
              <p><strong>141</strong> - this is another unique route launched
              under BSEP. For some reason, loading has been below my
              expectations. I thought 141 would get higher loading, given it
              serves Farrer Estate and cuts across NSL-CCL-EWL.</p>
              <p><strong>142</strong> - this one's been a bit of a surprise.
              Operating with 5 buses ever since launch. It deserves a fleet add,
              especially when it is only service catering to Potong Pasir HDB
              estate. It does role more of a feeder.</p>

              <p>What time did you go to Punggol? It is so crowded I think thats
              the reason why 3 lots are needed for 118 – they simply cant park
              too many buses at Punggol. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">101-150</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>107</strong> - same ratio of DD/SD for many years now.
                      Fleet is doing okay, loading sector is mainly from Lavendar MRT to
                      Potong Pasir</p>
              <p><strong>111</strong> - got capacity downgrade with DD-&gt;SD.
                      This happened 2 years back. sv 111 loading has improved again given
                      Queenstown development. Maybe time to get the SD-&gt;DD back</p>
              <p><strong>112</strong> - no fleet add even though route is v
                      unique and offers less alternatives throughout its entire route.
                      Note it also acts as feeder for HG Ave 7. Having said this, I
                      haven't seen 112 bursting and current fleet is able to manage the
                      load. Is it that HG Ave 7 HDBs have less flats or less occupancy.
                      Not sure!?</p>
              <p><strong>113</strong> - ha ha! the service that used to be much
                      in discussion few years back until the 2 users realized there is no
                      point speaking about it. Poorly planned route and disastrous
                      frequency.</p>
              <p><strong>116</strong> - not sure if this one should be counted.
                      It got downgrade from 7 buses to 6 and then got that bus back to
                      fleet of 7 buses. I would not say the fleet add was because of
                      better loading but more because the frequency was horrible at 20
                      mins. Now with 7 buses is around 15 mins. Somehow 3 years after
                      also, 116 loading remains not so great. Poor route planning.</p>
              <p><strong>120</strong> - since launched, 8 buses and guess it will
                      stay there for a long time, unless 120 route gets
                      modified/extended. loading is okay at some sector, totally
                      manageable by current fleet. </p>
              <p><strong>121</strong> - no fleet add since launch, 121 does
                      pretty well between Tiong Bahru and Tehlok Blangah, but for a
                      shorter route sports 8 buses and has decent frequency. </p>
              <p><strong>122</strong> - since launched early this year, no fleet
                      add. Frequency kind of sucks at 15-20 mins, but the loading has
                      failed to pick up. Most of the buses peak loading is at 20
                      pax. </p>
              <p><strong>132</strong> - no fleet add/upgrade. current fleet is
                      doing well + alternatives such as 145 and 165/166 in its high
                      loading sectors helps managing the load.</p>
              <p><strong>135</strong> - current fleet managing load well. some
                      how the routing is such that between amk and paya lebar loading
                      remains around 30-40 pax. Paya Lebar-Marine Parade depends totally
                      on 43, 76 arrival times.</p>
              <p><strong>136</strong> - no fleet add/upgrade. There were few
                      months when loading increases when Upp Serangoon flats were
                      launched and people took 136 to Kovan. I even thought would make
                      sense to launch 136A but then with 324 and 102 coming, 136 has gone
                      down the priority order again. In fact, sv 22 crossover DDs could
                      be changed to SD already!</p>
              <p><strong>140</strong> - guess it has its fair share of buses
                      already. 4 buses for the route it serves is good enough. 140 is a
                      sweet short trunk meeting unique commuter needs.</p>
              <p><strong>141</strong> - this is another unique route launched
                      under BSEP. For some reason, loading has been below my
                      expectations. I thought 141 would get higher loading, given it
                      serves Farrer Estate and cuts across NSL-CCL-EWL.</p>
              <p><strong>142</strong> - this one's been a bit of a surprise.
                      Operating with 5 buses ever since launch. It deserves a fleet add,
                      especially when it is only service catering to Potong Pasir HDB
                      estate. It does role more of a feeder.</p>

              <p>142 use to have DD bus. and 145 should have more DD buses. if 105 can have bendy buses from TT that will be good</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, with sbs 382G/W launched today, I saw almost all the parking slots fully occupied at Punggol interchange. Some buses need to move out first before some can park. But can still be considered as quite smooth sailing. Every now and then, buses go out and bus come in very fast. Parking lots had been drawn at the sides as well. Overall function quite okay compared to tampines interchange. I also took Sbs 382G/W as well. Many families board SBS 382G/W at Sumang walk and sumang link which were as expected. This is a good feeder service with route well planned. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
