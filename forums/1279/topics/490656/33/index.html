              <p>To all those people suggesting to split up 67, I suggest that you go and observe how many people take 28/67 at Bedok MRT during PM peak. And a lot of them alight at the first bus stop along Bedok North Ave 3, where there's only 28/45/67. If you want to touch 67, I'm interested to see how 28 is going to tank the load alone.</p>
              <p>(Unless there's a replacement route that uses New Upp Changi Rd via Bedok MRT)</p>
              <p>Furthermore, 67's route between Tampines Int and Bedok or even up to Kallang / Little India is very unique and well-utilised. Cutting it will make Bedok North Ave 3 residents lose their direct connection to Geylang (especially where 28 doesn't ply or skip bus stops) and even Little India / Mustafa. And in another direction, link to Tampines Int will also be lost (for those suggesting replacement routes to Pasir Ris instead), unless everybody is happy with 168 and a long walk to Tampine Int / town centre (northern tip) which I highly doubt so.</p>
              <p>And for those suggesting 21, 23, 65, 66 as alternatives, they basically serve different groups of people. And DTL3 is not even up yet, not to mention that DTL3 is not really parallel to 67.</p>

              Like what they did with 187 (TT - Canning Vale) and 194 (Transdev - Palmyra) in 2008? TT lost their only route that ran through Brentwood, which was replaced by 500 (Transdev - Palmyra). The portion once served by 194 (split into 505 and 514) wasn't covered any more.

              <p>26: Toa Payoh Interchange &lt;&gt; Changi Business Park Terminal</p>

              <p>- This will help provide alternate route to terminated 67 between Bedok MRT and Bedok North Ave 3 </p>
              <p>- This will provide direct MRT access to Chai Chee residents + trunk service to Geylang/Eunos/Bedok North/ITE/CBP</p>
              <p>- This will provide Bedok North Ave 4 residents connection to Bedok MRT along Upp Changi Road to transfer to other services (+ alternative to sv 17)</p>
              <p>- This will connect ITE, Expo, CBP directly to Bedok North and Chai Chee</p>
              <p>- Residents along Bedok North Ave 3 will have a direct connection to Geylang, albeit a bit more winding than current 67</p>
