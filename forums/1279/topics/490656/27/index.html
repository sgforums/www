              Good move by LTA. Although I prefered 102 to do Westcamp as 102 has limited demand at Jln Kayu sector.
              For 386, I have nothing to say, conservative.

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, LRT cannot reach edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end. Moreover, the two places are populated with HDB flats. 1 bus service is a bit too little considering that there are other roads in Singapore with at least 3 to 5 bus services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, there is a semi expressway right behind. The road is currently being used by vehicles for constructing.  If sbs 386 is routed to go and serve using that expressway, then another new service needs to come in to serve all the new bus stops erected outside horizon and greendale primary school. It is totally not possible that they take out the only service passing by these few stops without replacement. You can see from sbs 76/134 episode. If they want to do so, they will have done it this time. Unfortunately they reinforced it by doubling this connection. </p>
              <p>If they are to decide it to go by semi expressway which is totally behind all these buildings, sbs 386 route will have been totally different. No need to go to whole of Punggol east. It will need to go to Punggol drive to access the semi-expressway. As of present, these two roads cannot be linked straight across. Unless you need to demolish many HDB flats already built. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I don't know why do you assume that with this change Punggol Plaza connection will be withdrawn. Not necessary. 386 can go via semi-expressway in future from Edgefield Plains (end) to Edgedale Plains (end) and can then still do all of Edgedale Plains to Punggol Plaza and loop as of today. The only stop that will be skipped is Oasis LRT along Punggol Dr (which if you see today has almost 0 boarding/alighting) because you have LRT connecting Punggol Dr to Punggol Plaza.</p>

Note that the mall will also have Punggol polyclinic. This mall is just nicely located in between these 2 roads. It is not possible for people to keep walking. I doubt they will re-route it to go by semi-expressway. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes the mall is under construction since mid June 2015 and is slated for completion in Q4 2017/Q1 2018. The polyclinic may open first. The mall is named oasis terraces. This is so called the neighbourhood mall for edgefield and edgedale plus many others living along Punggol drive. Expects lots of crowds again and it is pity there are only sbs 50 and sbs 386 serving this mall. It is also a pity that one feeder bus service sbs 386 is expected to serve so many areas inside Punggol east. However it is also good that it connects many areas that well using 1 bus service. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>There is a likelihood that the new BSEP buses registered from now onwards are in the new SGâ™¡Bus livery.</p>

                          <p>If bus service 258 gets capacity downgrade in the form of double-to-single decker bus replacements, it is likely that some of bus service 258's double decker buses will be re-deployed on either bus service 117 or 386. If there is no other BSEP bus with SBS Transit livery, it is likely that the rest of the new buses will be brand new buses in the new SGâ™¡Bus livery.</p>

              <p>The service 66 (West) can run from Jurong East and terminate at Bendemeer Terminus, located at Downtown Line Stage 3 station if necessary.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes the mall is under construction since mid
              June 2015 and is slated for completion in Q4 2017/Q1 2018. The
              polyclinic may open first. The mall is named oasis terraces. This
              is so called the neighbourhood mall for edgefield and edgedale plus
              many others living along Punggol drive. Expects lots of crowds
              again and it is pity there are only sbs 50 and sbs 386 serving this
              mall. It is also a pity that one feeder bus service sbs 386 is
              expected to serve so many areas inside Punggol east. However it is
              also good that it connects many areas that well using 1 bus
              service. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Ok. I thought Oasis Terraces is a new condo. Given that there is Waterway Point condo just opened + Punggol Plaza. So lot of options for Punggol residents.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, it is not much actually. Sengkang area has 4 malls, namely seletar mall, compass point (renamed as 1 sengkang mall), rivervale plaza and rivervale mall. So there should be 2 more coming up for Punggol. They are the northshore mall already announced and oasis terraces already in construction. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
