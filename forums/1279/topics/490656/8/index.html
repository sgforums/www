              <p>I was looking at all the SWTs and I realised the objective of
              supplementary services ('M' variants) under BSEP may be to replace
              some SWTs.</p>
              <p>143M is a replacement for 143A, 63M is a replacement for the old
              peak-hour 63M, 139M is a replacement for 139A, 123M is a
              replacement for the old peak-hour 123M, 17A is a replacement for
              the old peak-hour 17A, 859A/B are replacements for the old midnight
              859A, 53M is a replacement for 53A/B, 43M is a replacement and
              extension of 43A (from Buangkok Green to Serangoon)...</p>
              <p>And up to date, LTA has not introduced any 'M' variant that is
              not based on an original SWT.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I think LTA was experimenting with converting these
              short-distance SWTs to full-day services and see the outcome.
              However, as we see far less 'M' variants this year than
              in 2014, I suspect that LTA has seen this experiment as rather
              unsuccessful and may not be proceeding with introduction of such
              supplementary services.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Let's analyze M variants that have been introduced:</p>
              <p>43M - This was required, but <strong>not</strong> from Punggol to NEX rather from Buangkok MRT to NEX (loop). The buses go empty between Buangkok and Punggol and obviously so as there is MRT to connect + parent service 43.</p>
              <p>63M - makes absolute sense. The question is the number of buses added is too many. Can cut 1-2 buses. The better fix would have been 63 getting DDs but because of Rumm Tunggi, it cannot, so 63M was necessary</p>
              <p>53M - this could have been averted by just extending 113 but I think LTA does not want to add any resources to 113 given its poor loading. It does make sense IMO. Though 45A should go. Is it still operational?</p>
              <p>123M - this is necessary as well for Bukit Purmei residents, though 1 bus can be cut.</p>
              <p>139M - I also support introduction of this M variant and it is doing well</p>
              <p>143M - This is the M variant which was just <strong>NOT</strong> needed. Waste of resources. </p>
              <p>859 A/B - This is absolutely needed due to lack of feeder service.</p>
              <p>So out of the 7 M variants introduced, 5 are quite good. 1 route should have been shorter and 1 was not required.</p>

              <p>LTA refused to extend 113 to Serangoon as it wants to maintain the connection to Hougang Street 11, even though it is just 900metres away from Serangoon Station.</p>
              <p>They said there are still quite a number of people that takes 113 from inside Street 11. Not all are willing to walk out to Upper Paya Lebar Road to take 80 to Kovan / Hougang. (80 and 113 uses almost the same time to reach Kovan station). 53 and 53M has successfully taken off the AM loading from 113 but the PM loading for 113 is still <strong>heavy.</strong></p>
              <p>53M has too many buses IMO. The runtime is very relaxed. Drivers that drive 113 are often deployed to drive 53M btw. The off peak freq for 53M can be as long as 26minutes</p>

              for 113 is still <strong>heavy.</strong></p>
              <p>53M has too many buses IMO. The runtime is very relaxed. Drivers
              that drive 113 are often deployed to drive 53M btw. The off peak
              freq for 53M can be as long as 26minutes</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, they have already made it clear from the very start that for BSEP, loading is not the start-all or end-all for the newly introduced bus services. It is we all the people who have that perception that loading is important and keep on expecting them to make adjustment to it. Thus when we don't see any amendment, we have this sense of disbelief that it should not be this way. This is what we termed different set of expectation levels. What we people see is one set of loading (even a few) then we came out of our ideas to amend a portion of the routes which should realistically not be the way. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I AGREE with you. LTA has made some big mistakes in launching routes, and they haven't used the data well. </p>
              <p>But once they have launched the routes, it is difficult for them to make amends. They are scared the few people it serves may not be happy and make loud noise about it. Anyway, they have deep pockets, so they don't bother. If their pockets were limited, they would have to think harder and use resources more wisely.</p>

              <p>Buses that never received fleet upgrade/add after BSEP was launched (+3 years now)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-50</span></strong></p>
              <p>9 - there was capacity add + upgrades on both sv 19/89 doing Changi Cargo but none on sv 9.</p>
              <p>16 - after Dakota MRT, loading dropped drastically between Orchard and Dunman road. Current fleet is able to manage loading well, hence agree no add required. </p>
              <p>18 - this service operates at 18-20 minutes frequency. It is just a back up service there with limited resources. </p>
              <p>24 - surprisingly this  Changi Airport service has not received fleet add for years now. I think it could be because of parallelism with MRT + other services along the route that have not substantiated the need</p>
              <p>26 - this service actually has pretty decent loading between Geylang and Toa Payoh, but somehow has not got any add/upgrade</p>
              <p>27 - due to lack of DDs, already 32 buses had been added by SBST managing the load well. Hence. But 27 really needed DDs. LTA answered with 118.</p>
              <p>30 - surprisingly this heavy loading service got no upgrade/fleet add. Have to say SBST has done a good job maintaining the frequency/loading on sv 30</p>
              <p>32 - lol. no need. just a back up service. surprisingly even after the Margaret Dr HDBs in Queenstown, both 32 and 122 haven't really picked up its loading. Is it that the occupancy at those HDBs still remains v low?</p>
              <p>37 - this service had received DD upgrades just before BSEP was introduced. Having said this I do feel the lone KUB also needs to be converted to DD slot. There is crash loading on this service and needs to be treated like JIS - full fleet DD. The KUB cannot tank the load. Also, sv 4 has relieved loading on sv 37 to some extent. </p>
              <p>38 - needs fleet reduction, if any!!</p>
              <p>41 - since launched, no add/upgrade and not required. Actually DD--&gt;SD should be done, and fleet add with Citaro as frequency is around 12-15 mins. Fleet should look like 6 SDs, 2 DDs.</p>

              <p>Buses that never received fleet upgrade/add after BSEP was launched (+3 years now)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1-50</span></strong></p>
              <p>9 - there was capacity add + upgrades on both sv 19/89 doing Changi Cargo but none on sv 9.</p>
              <p>16 - after Dakota MRT, loading dropped drastically between Orchard and Dunman road. Current fleet is able to manage loading well, hence agree no add required. </p>
              <p>18 - this service operates at 18-20 minutes frequency. It is just a back up service there with limited resources. </p>
              <p>24 - surprisingly this  Changi Airport service has not received fleet add for years now. I think it could be because of parallelism with MRT + other services along the route that have not substantiated the need</p>
              <p>26 - this service actually has pretty decent loading between Geylang and Toa Payoh, but somehow has not got any add/upgrade</p>
              <p>27 - due to lack of DDs, already 32 buses had been added by SBST managing the load well. Hence. But 27 really needed DDs. LTA answered with 118.</p>
              <p>30 - surprisingly this heavy loading service got no upgrade/fleet add. Have to say SBST has done a good job maintaining the frequency/loading on sv 30</p>
              <p>32 - lol. no need. just a back up service. surprisingly even after the Margaret Dr HDBs in Queenstown, both 32 and 122 haven't really picked up its loading. Is it that the occupancy at those HDBs still remains v low?</p>
              <p>37 - this service had received DD upgrades just before BSEP was introduced. Having said this I do feel the lone KUB also needs to be converted to DD slot. There is crash loading on this service and needs to be treated like JIS - full fleet DD. The KUB cannot tank the load. Also, sv 4 has relieved loading on sv 37 to some extent. </p>
              <p>38 - needs fleet reduction, if any!!</p>
              <p>41 - since launched, no add/upgrade and not required. Actually DD--&gt;SD should be done, and fleet add with Citaro as frequency is around 12-15 mins. Fleet should look like 6 SDs, 2 DDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>

              <p><br>9 - Indeed needs fleet add. Although it can be argued that svc 9's loading from Simei MRT all the way to Airport Cargo may be less than 19/89, 9's loading mainly peaks at Tampines Ave 2/7 and Loyang Ave... Especiall at Ave 2 where it receives a lot of transfer pax. And that's where the DDs can get really packed...</p>
              <p>16 - Maybe it's time to divert it back to Stadium.</p>
              <p>38 - This service is a unique and key inter-town service especially for Simei. Although 20 is there, it doesn't really serve Tampines East CC &amp; Ave 7 which are key transport nodes in Tampines East. Frequency of 20 also depends... And since Eastpoint Mall is open now, expect more people from Tampines / Bedok South shopping there.</p>
              <p>And again for Bedok South, 38 provides the fastest link to Bedok MRT. Although there's 12 and 47 to Tanah Merah, not all residents prefer this kind of backtracking... And although there's 229, it's simply too winding.</p>

              loading from Simei MRT all the way to Airport Cargo may be less
              than 19/89, 9's loading mainly peaks at Tampines Ave 2/7 and Loyang
              Ave... Especiall at Ave 2 where it receives a lot of transfer pax.
              And that's where the DDs can get really packed...</p>
              <p>16 - Maybe it's time to divert it back to Stadium.</p>
              <p>38 - This service is a unique and key inter-town service
              especially for Simei. Although 20 is there, it doesn't
              really serve Tampines East CC &amp; Ave 7 which are key
              transport nodes in Tampines East. Frequency of 20 also
              depends... And since Eastpoint Mall is open now, expect more
              people from Tampines / Bedok South shopping there.</p>
              <p>And again for Bedok South, 38 provides the fastest link to Bedok
              MRT. Although there's 12 and 47 to Tanah Merah, not all residents
              prefer this kind of backtracking... And although there's 229, it's
              simply too winding.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>9 - I think frequency is already quite good and managing well with current fleet.</p>
              <p>16 - agree</p>
              <p>38 - actually people do prefer back tracking to Tanah Merah instead of taking MRT from Bedok, since 38 goes to interchange and its a long walk to MRT + congestion can be quite bad. Maybe observe PM peak for 38 at interchange and you will know. Each bus gets around 15-25 pax in my last observation. Most are those who alight at Bedok to shop at the mall. 229 is too winding. If 229 is made direct, can already do away with 38 and have it as a Tampines-Simei (loop) service.</p>
              <p>51 - The 20-25 pax that have moved to each 120, 121, 122 have definitely caused a dent to sv 51. I listed above the better/closer MRT options these serve than 51</p>
              <p>95/96 - ok shouldn't give excuse of student service, but you should know that 179 has also not got fleet add in last 3 years. I believe their capacity is just right to meet the demands. </p>

              <p>Indeed, this backtracking to 38 is one of the few good points of 47, as it passes directly to Tanah Merah but not Bedok MRT.</p>

              <p>Haha.  If you discussed with enough Simei residents you'd be convinced that it's a cause and effect, and that the poor loading is an effect of the poor frequency rather than a cause.</p>

              <p>Actually, the loading in Simei is dependent on whether was there a Svc 20 in front of Svc 38.</p>

              <p>I agree with this. 20 and 38 follow similar routes in the sense that they both detour off Simei Rd (via St 4, St 3, St 1) then back onto Simei Rd.  And I know of cases where residents prefer 20 because 1) the buses are newer and “better/high quality” (yes I have literally heard them say that) due to full BSEP fleet, though this remains to be seen due to the addition of Scania perms and 2) shorter route to Tampines Interchange.</p>
