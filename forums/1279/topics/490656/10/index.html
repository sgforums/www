              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, with sbs 382G/W launched today, I saw almost all
              the parking slots fully occupied at Punggol interchange. Some buses
              need to move out first before some can park. But can still be
              considered as quite smooth sailing. Every now and then, buses go
              out and bus come in very fast. Parking lots had been drawn at the
              sides as well. Overall function quite okay compared to tampines
              interchange. I also took Sbs 382G/W as well. Many families board
              SBS 382G/W at Sumang walk and sumang link which were as expected.
              This is a good feeder service with route well planned. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>This is a very common scene today at most interchanges. Observed often during PM peak at Hougang Interchange, Jurong East Interchange, CCK Interchange where there is queue of buses waiting to park. Looks like Punggol is joining the list.</p>

              <p>Agree on 145 but because of lack of DDs earlier, the service already has 27 buses. The operating frequency is bet 06-08 mins (pretty good). The DDs are doing fine but given the frequency and headway, not always well utilized. Adding more DDs will make sense if they decide to cut back the fleet to 24-25 buses with 10 DDs, 14 KUBs.

              <p>105 same case. 26 buses. Doing pretty fine with SDs with so many buses. </p>

              <p>You are right. It was LO2x. At that point in time, we had many feeders such as 333, 335 also operating with those LO2x. Not sure how people reacted when the DDs were downgraded to SDs on these routes.</p>

              <p>What is up with 118? It already has very a high loading during peak hours and serves several large segments of commuters, both workers and students. Buses are already full and this is excluding ITE students as they are still having their holidays. 118 suffers from excessive runtime and poor frequency as well as possibly a lack of buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>118 has been allocated 17 minutes to go from TPE bus stop to IKEA bus stop during peak hours while 27 and 168 has 7 minutes to do so. What is this? Has LTA learnt from their previous mistakes of giving a service ridiculously generous runtime (972 anyone??) to the point that quality and reliability of service compromised???</p>

              <p>What is up with 118? It already has very a high loading during
              peak hours and serves several large segments of commuters, both
              workers and students. Buses are already full and this is excluding
              ITE students as they are still having their holidays. 118 suffers
              from excessive runtime and poor frequency as well as possibly a
              lack of buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>118 has been allocated 17 minutes to go from TPE bus stop to
              IKEA bus stop during peak hours while 27 and 168 has 7 minutes to
              do so. What is this? Has LTA learnt from their previous mistakes of
              giving a service ridiculously generous runtime (972 anyone??) to
              the point that quality and reliability of service
              compromised???</p>

              <p>983 is very slow. I took it on Wed and it took forever to do cck ave 7 and cck grove. Totally empty roads yet the BC was going super slow. I think he did not want to bunch with A22 in front that departed just 03 mins before.</p>

This has provided better connectivity, reduced crowding and shortened waiting times for commuters. Commuters can expect a total of 1,000 buses to be added by 2017.</span></span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Nine new/extended bus services in 4Q2015 to enhance connectivity</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">2.  Between October and December 2015, seven new bus services were introduced, i.e. SBS Transit Services 47, 117, 118 and 258, SMRT Service 979 and City Direct Services (CDS) 664 and 665. Two existing bus services – SBS Transit Service 49 and SMRT Service 983 – were also extended. A total of 61 new buses were deployed for these routes. These new and extended bus services have improved connectivity for residents of Bedok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Jurong West, Marine Parade, Punggol, Sembawang, Tampines and Yishun. They bring the total number of new or extended services under BSEP to 54.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">3.  Commuters can look forward to more new routes in Eunos, Marine Parade and Yishun by March 2016. One new route, SBS Transit Service 382, which serves the new housing developments in Punggol West, as well as key amenities such as the new Punggol SAFRA Clubhouse, has started operations on 3 January 2016. More new routes will be announced later.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">80 weekly trips added to reduce crowding and shorten wait times</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">4.  To reduce crowding and shorten waiting times, seven additional buses were deployed to improve five<a style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: #006699;" href="http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=2b469fa2-dced-4a18-b2e6-62aba89458ee#1"><sup style="margin: 0px;">[1]</sup></a> </span><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">bus services during morning and evening peak hours in the fourth quarter of 2015.

In total, the operators have added 90 weekly trips during peak hours for these services in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is in addition to the 80 additional weekly peak-hour bus trips added by the Government under the BSEP during the same period.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Higher service levels with more BSEP buses</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">6.  The BSEP was started in September 2012. Together with the buses injected by the public transport operators (PTOs) and the use of private bus operators to provide additional capacity through the City Direct Services and the Peak Period Short Services, the BSEP will expand the public bus fleet by about 35%.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">7.  Commuters can expect better service levels and connectivity over time. By 2017, buses will be added to about 8 out of 10 feeder bus services. Connectivity will also be further improved with the introduction of 80 new routes.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">8.  With the additional capacity provided by BSEP buses, PTOs will be required to deliver higher service standards. Currently, 95% of feeder services are required to operate at 10-minute or shorter intervals during the morning and evening peak periods. This will be further tightened to 100% of feeder services operating at 8-minute or shorter intervals by 2017 when the BSEP is fully implemented.</span></p>
