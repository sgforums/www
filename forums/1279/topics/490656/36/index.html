              <p>That's pretty obvious. Though, I am beginning to suspect that once rationalisation begins with the opening of DTL3, there may be new services (not old services chopped up), with the freeing of resoruces from winding routes that are no longer necessary. This could happen post-BSEP. </p>

              <p>That makes sense, but it would make 48 slightly longer. LTA might not want to play with long-haul services, although 48 is quite direct and was extended in the past. </p>
              <p>As for the new Bedok North service, looping at Bedok North St 2 would be good.

              <p>Excellent. Sv 46 is like I proposed for sv 14 extension to
              Tampines. It is to connect UEC/Bedok South/Fengshan to future DTL3.
              Also with this they are connecting Tampines Ave 3/st 83 to

              <p>Maybe I wasn't clear. New services on top of chopped up routes. I.e, route A is split into Route A &amp; B, but there may be route C also. </p>

              <p>Because svc 26 is not considered a long trunk svc and furthermore its quite direct to interchange because it only skipped 4 bus stops and gain 10 bus stops unlike svc 28 which distance is over 23km in one direction and the jam proned route it goes.Svc 46 is just another 69 which provide inter town connectivity.</p>

              <p>Actually... 48 could have been extended to CBP if sv 47 had not been introduced.. I don't see the use of 2 services from Marine Parade to go CBP. </p>
              <p>What is needed is a CBP service going to Bedok North. Actually 46 could have been CBP-Tampines via Bedok North Road, but I think they made it ply Bedok South Ave 3 keeping in mind future DTL3.</p>

              <p>Finally. Both Fengshan and Tampines West have been suffering from terrible inter-town connections and I must say 46 effectively killed many birds with one stone, with connections to DTL and TEL (Sungei Bedok) as well.</p>
