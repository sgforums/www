                  <p>I recommend making the same suggestion across various forums. Not really for different views and opinions, because apparently it's the same people everywhere (anyway, how big is Singapore?). Rather, it is for the voice.</p>
                  <p>Say the same thing over many platforms. The more platforms, the louder the voice. And the higher the chances of being heard by the LTA.</p>
              <p>Anyway, well, if it is observed that after the Downtown Line opens, the loading drops, we could extend the route of the affected bus services, so that they can serve more areas and recover the losses from there.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I think I am wrong this time. Heard that sbs 118 will be launched from Punggol to Changi business park interchange on 20 dec 2015. This will be CBP 1st bus service. No wonder there are 2 plaques being constructed at berth B2 and B4 at Punggol bus interchange. So excited that after waiting for close to 9 months, they will launch 2 Punggol services Sbs 117 and SBS 118 at the same time! Cheers! </p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, I heard it is near completion. If sbs 118 is launched, it must be able to take in. Unless they plan for initial looping around CBP first. </p>
              <p>The additional plaque at B3 was up there for more than 8 months already. So it is only 2 additional plaque at B2 and B4 that were recently erected this week. </p>
              <p>84 only got 2 buses. 50 and 119 were added many years ago. With 386 added last year, its capacity should have been almost full with at most 1 more addition. Thus I only thought will launch sbs 117. Since they launch another sbs 118, should just squeeze everything to the limit. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
