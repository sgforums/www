              <p>With regards to Eunos area, I feel that the weakest links are the HDB flats at Lengkong Tiga and the industrial area at Eunos Industrial Estate. We can create one new bus service for them.</p>
              <p>The route could be like this:</p>
              <p>Eunos Bus Interchange &gt; Eunos Road 2 &gt; Eunos Avenue 5 &gt; Eunos Road 5 &gt; Eunos Avenue 6 &gt; Eunos Road 8 &gt; Eunos Avenue 5 &gt; Paya Lebar Road (Paya Lebar MRT) &gt; Sims Avenue &gt; Sims Avenue East &gt; Jalan Kembangan &gt; Lengkong Tiga &gt; Jalan Daud &gt; Lorong Melayu &gt; Jalan Ishak &gt; Lorong Marzuki &gt; Sims Avenue East &gt; Lorong Melayu &gt; Changi Road &gt; Paya Lebar Road &gt; Eunos Avenue 5 &gt; Eunos Road 5 &gt; Eunos Avenue 4 &gt; Eunos Road 2 &gt; Eunos Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>The length is only around 10.7 kilometres. :)</p>
              <p>This would connect Lengkong Tiga to a town centre (ie. Paya Lebar MRT Station), while provide a bus connection to Eunos Industrial Estate.</p>

              <p>Yes, but 4, 41 and 122 nonetheless have benefited many more
              private housing estates compared to say other BSEP
              services. </p>
              <p>It is not out of the realm to think or to ask for a new service
              for Kembangan to Marine Parade. Kembangan/Changi Rd area have a lot
              of condos and about 10++ HDB blocks, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">about the same condo population as
              Flora Dr</span></strong>. So there should be demand considering
              that it's a new connection. Marine Parade boasts many nearby
              schools plus many shopping options. My main source of demand is not
              Frankel/Opera. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">But might as well use Frankel
              to reach Marine Parade since it is the fastest connection? Too many
              services for Frankel because it duplicates 32 you might say.
              Simple. Re-route 32 to Telok Kurau Rd. It is a supplementary
              service, so it can supplement 15 &amp; 155. It should not be the
              sole service for Frankel Av. Even though 42 duplicates 32 to
              Kembangan MRT, it is only a one-way connection. No. of services to
              Kembangan  - 2 vs no. of services from Kembangan MRT - 0.
              Stupid right! So, you kill two-birds with one stone - you fix the
              problem of poor MRT access on Frankel Av, plus you provide a new
              Kembangan-Marine Parade sector and you solve the problem of
              duplication with 32 along Frankel Av by re-routing it to Telok
              Kurau Rd. </span></p>
              <p>And honestly, this new service would get a heck of lot more
              demand than 122 because it is so unique. After all, it is faster
              just to cycle to Marine Parade from Kembangan/Changi Rd than to use
              the bus. That's how bad it is. </p>
              <p>And if you wanna kpkb about no HDB, Kembangan got HDB, Haig Rd
              also got HDB. And really, Haig Rd can take buses la. About the same
              size of HDBs that 122 serves. Plus unlike 122, this is is a not a
              laughable supplementary services. </p>
              <p>And Margaret Dr where got HDB? You mean Commonwealth Dr, where
              122 essentially duplicates 195. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Where Margaret Dr got HDB?? Are you sure?? There are huge HDB blocks that opened last year. That's why 122 was introduced in first place.</p>

              <p>You mean the handful of new high-rise blocks at Dawson? Okay, true, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my apologies</span></strong> and yes big population because of their height, but again 122 is very duplicative of many services along Alexandria Rd, which is a few minutes walk of these blocks, it is even a carbon copy of 32 to some extent (though of course it has terrible frequencies hands down). The only new link that benefits a HDB estate (if diedie BSEP can only benefit HDB) is between the handful of blocks at Clarence Lane and the fringes of Jln Bukit Ho Swee Estate to Tiong Bahru/SGH. But even then, you walk abit, and can find an assortment of other services doing the same. </p>
              <p>Of course there are several unique connections it provides especially for the schools, so don't get me wrong.Though on the whole, it is very duplicative which a Kembangan to Marine Parade service proposed by several forumers is not. </p>

              &gt; Sims Avenue East &gt; Jalan Kembangan &gt; Lengkong Tiga &gt;

              <p>The length is only around 10.7 kilometres. :)</p>
              <p>This would connect Lengkong Tiga to a town centre (ie. Paya

              Industrial Estate.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Eunos Industrial Estate may be a bit narrow because of all the light trucks that occupy the side roads, but worthy of consideration nonetheless. Jalan Daud, Lorong Melayu etc are all narrow but similar, if not wider, than Serangoon Gardens so one-way service is possible. But I doubt we will see small residential streets seeing new servivces - Opera Estate, Serangoon Gardens, Jln Remaja etc are served because of legacy issues. But a Kembangan - Paya Lebar link is worthy of consideration. Even though you could argue Changi Rd is within walking distance, but hey, seeing as our friends in Dawson have a break with 122, why not Kembangan? </p>

I remember 32 used to loop at Chinatown in the old days, so I played around with the different sectors of 16, 32 &amp; 33 before hitting upon the idea of restoring the Frankel Ave-Chinatown link via Suntec City (currently served by Route 16). Notice that I have included Chai Chee into the picture too as I feel that area needs a better connection to Kembangan MRT.</p>

              <p>You mean the handful of new high-rise blocks at Dawson? Okay,
              true, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my
              apologies</span></strong> and yes big population because of their
              height, but again 122 is very duplicative of many services along
              Alexandria Rd, which is a few minutes walk of these blocks, it is
              even a carbon copy of 32 to some extent (though of course it has
              terrible frequencies hands down). The only new link that benefits a
              HDB estate (if diedie BSEP can only benefit HDB) is between the
              handful of blocks at Clarence Lane and the fringes of Jln Bukit Ho
              Swee Estate to Tiong Bahru/SGH. But even then, you walk abit, and
              can find an assortment of other services doing the same. </p>
              <p>Of course there are several unique connections it provides
              especially for the schools, so don't get me wrong.Though on the
              whole, it is very duplicative which a Kembangan to Marine Parade
              service proposed by several forumers is not. </p>

              <p>I do agree with you  that 122 could have been planned better. Especially the Commonwealth Dr part, and terminating point at NBR Terminal are so redundant. Buses go empty between Margaret and Commonwealth Dr almost at all times. It would have been better to loop at Queenstown MRT and pull back to Margaret Estate via Dawson Road with new bus stops.</p>
              <p>Frankel has 32, and maybe 32 needs to be changed a bit as it is quite duplicative to other services as well. This makes 32 not very popular as it is not a reliable service.</p>

Another interesting thing I observed is that many Dawson residents prefer to take 32 from the Margaret Drive bus stop at the junction between Mag drive and Dawson Road than taking 122 from Kay Siang Road. It may be either that they are lazy to walk to the Kay Siang Road bus stop or they may feel that going to Redhill Mrt by 32 is faster as compared to taking 122 to Tiong Bahru. I feel that 122's loading will pick up eventually when more Margaret Drive estate is fully developed by 2020 and when the condos at Prince Charles are completed. </span></p></div>

              <p>Agreed, though I disagree with pulling back at Dawson because 122 is very duplicative of services at Alexandria anyway. If 122 linked up Maragaret Dr with One-North this would at least provide a unique connection, thus higher loading. Or looping at the 61 side of Commonwealth Dr would also serve a larger catchment area and provide a new connection to Commonwealth MRT, Queenstown Library, Tiong Bahru and all the schools it serves. </p>
              <p> Difficult to amend 32 because even though it is duplicative, it often only duplicates one service and not multiple services. Long route and winding route so it has reliability issues. This is why 32 should just be a supplementary service. Plying Telok Kurau is sensible because Telok Kurau has many condominiums and there is no connection to Katong only to MP with 15, so 32 can supplement that as 15 can be very crowded. The connection between Katong &amp; Bedok is still intact. Opens up Frankel Av/East Coast Rd for a new short-haul higher frequency service serving Kembangan MRT. </p>

              <p>122 does have unique catchment of Kay Siang / Margaret and Alexandra Road to Tiong Bahru. But loading on 122 can never be super high. Hence, it stays at 7 buses with a meagre 12-15 mins frequency.</p>

              <p>You didn't know 43M loops back to Punggol?</p>
              <p>43M should still have 6 SDs... while 43 should operate with 13 DDs, 6 SDs... current fleet is 10 DDs, 11 SDs.</p>

              <p>Are you serious about 19 buses for 43?</p>
              <p>It's not about the number of DDs. 43 operates at a frequency of 11-14 mins from 6.30 am to 7.00 am. 43 needs 1 fleet add.</p>
              <p>On service 43/43M, Citaro passenger hogs are quite common throughout the day. The Citaro is just 1-2 mins ahead of a DD. The Citaro usually has far more passengers than the DD behind.</p>
