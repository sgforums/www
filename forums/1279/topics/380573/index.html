              <p>S61:14 WLDEP duties will be handed back to KJDEP.Guess they've learn the lesson that WLDEP is far away to BBT.</p>
              <p>S173:Given back to KJDEP</p>
              <p>S852:3 WLDEP duties will be handed over to KJDEP.Technically its dual control.</p>
              <p>S190:3 AMDEP duties will be given back to KJDEP.Back to old times.Full KJDEP control.</p>
              <p>S960:3 or 4 WLDEP duties will be given to AMDEP.</p>

              <p>S171:3 AMDEP duties will be given to WLDEP.</p>
              <p>S980:2 AMDEP duties will be given to WLDEP.980 will get perm S shift bendies probably from WLDEP.</p>

              <p>S184:Same as 700/A.</p>
              <p>S178 @ S187 will be dual control by both WLDEP @ KJDEP with WLDEP is the biggest controller.Hmm maybe KJDEP start first bus from BNL?</p>
              <p>S177:Timing will be enhanced.</p>
              <p>S77:Probably to loop @ Marina rather than terminate.</p>

              <p>1. I think the problem is that the 2 AMDEP full day fellas (1042E 1177A) keep at CCK Int at night, so the dead mileage is quite significant. Can somebody confirm if the AMDEP buses go off service from CCK at night?</p>
              <p>3. 171 may not get O405Gs thanks to it being a WAB service... SMRT will continue to flood it with OC500LEs and boost frequency, negating the need for bendies though they are majorly required. Moreover MCT has limited parking space as well.. so might be a bit difficult to change shift there.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For 190 AM Bendies they off service to AMDEP.For 106 AM side they change shift at MCT,Only a couple of duties change shift at BBT on Sundays.Imagine SL staying in Kallang/Eastern area change shift at BBT..Technically for proposed AM 960 @ 75 is that they required to start at MCT for the convienance of depot drivers and pax too.So no need to waste so many fuel for KJ/WL side to OS from their depot to MCT.The only way to free up parking space at MCT is to make 77 to loop there.171 is possible to make majority WL control.</p></div>

              <p><br>1) and 2)  I would miss scanias cameo on 61 and 173. Probably, sole 173 scania permer TIB657M would return to 178.</p>
              <p>3) Hope 2 duties from AM would send the OCs over to WLDEP so as not to affect WAB pouplation.</p>
              <p>4) So, would ex-WL 700 permers like: TIB471G, TIB472D etc... come back to 700 whereas ex-KJ 61 permers like: TIB630P, TIB631L etc... also?</p>
              <p>5) Imagine DAF cameo on 178, 187 and 852??? 178 and 852 might also get OC cameo mostly from KJ since KJ has many SP OCs.</p>

              <p>Its not compulsory to transfer the WABs over to Woodlands. If there is a need the next batch of WABs coming in will be deployed to WL.</p>

              <p> <br>If I am not wrong service 980 used to have a perm full-day bendy in 2002. Rego was TIB1201M followed by TIB1174H. The bendy was withdrawn in Sept 2003 and replaced by a UMW Lance. Also to add on that TIB883B did service 160 (before renumbering took place) in early 1998.</p>
              <p>In fact I feel that service 171 (WLDEP) should be the one getting OC500LEs instead of service 187/961, now that WLDEP had taken in OC500LEs.</p>

              <p>Back to those old days for some Bt Panjang services.</p>
              <p>Service 178 and 187 getting back DAF fleets. For services 75 getting Lances, hmm... Worse till service 960 might get cameo UMW Lances too. I feel that service 75 should go back to full WLDEP instead.</p>
              <p>Whereas service 852 will be better to come under dual AMDEP/KJDEP controlled instead of WLDEP.</p>
              <p>Service 980 had always been ping-ponged between AMDEP and WLDEP all these while ever since service 950 was introduced. Back to those days when 4/13 duties under WLDEP. Feel that service 980 should get bendies running on those 2 s-shift blocks.</p>
              <p>Having perm bendies on servce 855 will be good to ease the crowds during peak hours.</p>
              <p>Service 171 to have 3 more duties to WLDEP means cut 2-3 OC500LEs, unless WLDEP is willing to deploy them.</p>
              <p>For service 700 to go back WLDEP, lesser chances to get any more OC500LEs. Unless KJDEP decided to transfer more SP Batch 2 OC500LEs to WLDEP. Service 970 remains under KJDEP due to the mass redeployment of OC500LEs?</p>

              2002. Rego was TIB1201M followed by TIB1174H. The bendy was
              withdrawn in Sept 2003 and replaced by a UMW Lance. Also to add on
              that TIB883B did service 160 (before renumbering took place) in
              early 1998.</p>
              <p>In fact I feel that service 171 (WLDEP) should be the one

              <p>Yes. After the bendy is taken out, even off peak the buses can be packed to the brim even during off peak.</p>

SMRT will continue to flood it with OC500LEs and boost frequency, negating the need for bendies though they are majorly required.

              <p>AMDEP to NBR off-service is 17.8km</p>

              <p>Total dead running wise I think it might be more wise for KJDEP to take full control as assuming the first bus from NBR (AMDEP bus, 190AM/PM01) keeps at NBR at night, the total dead mileage is 35.6km and if it keeps at CCK, the dead mileage is 34.5km</p>
              <p>For KJDEP to take back this run, the two possibilities are 32.3km and 48.8km dead mileage. I suspect both 190PM01 and PM02 end at CCK though as they are only 20 mins apart departing from NBR on their first trip. Need to confirm.</p>

              <p>Heard from 2 guys at SMRT buses that there are numbers of
              redeployment fro year 2010 from February onwards.One is reliable
              another is just a Senior SL.Anyway i just treat it as RUMOURS as
              it's not yet official</p>
              <p>S700/A:All KJDEP duties will be given back to WLDEP.</p>
              <p>S184:Same as 700/A.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note:Nothing is confirmed till further notice</p>

              <p>i don't think it would be a good idea, look, if 700 and 184 goes back to Woodlands it would be just far, whereas Kranji is near.</p>
