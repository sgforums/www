              <p>Sound if you've been working for SMRTB before.Yes i agree that SMRT do not need another depot but AM @ KJ seriously need to be relocated at new multi storey or expand their depot.If they got spaces why not they buy more new buses for their services?Right now even if they add more new buses where the buses are supposed to park?Hence the bad freq that some of you experience.All they need is a piece of land from LTA and the approval from that woman.AMDEP already got plans(The land in front of the depot) to expand but till now no news</p>

              <p>Overnight road side parking are more prone to vandalism.KJDEP have to consider CCK for the time being.At least 56 buses can park there with security guards.Last time at Yishun there's a group of nao hia teenagers throw stone at the buses,ditto for Pasir Ris too.Security also bochap one,Fear for their safety.AMDEP should move to a new 2 storey bus park</p>

              <p>Maybe SMRT may consider to lease the land in front of AMDEP? It's big enough to build a MSBP there.</p>
