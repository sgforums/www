              <p>I will certainly agree that WLDEP is too far from Bt Batok Int.
              But for 190, it is just 4 bus from AMDEP. Not much difference. For
              svc 67, I also feel that Tampines Int is also quite far away from
              AMDEP. It should be full control by KJDEP.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>KJDEP to TMI is 28.4km</p>
              <p>AMDEP to TMI is 16km</p>
              <p>So AMDEP to Tampines is further than KJDEP to Tampines in your opinion? There will be a lot of dead running if KJDEP fully controls 67.</p>

              Pity those AMDEP SLs,Have to go far away from home ground to start or end work.
              
              At least for KJ side they're nearer to BBT,BPJ,CCK @ BNL.WL side near to WDL,BPJ,SBW and YIS too where AM side have to start or change shift at Lor 1,Eunos,Bedok,Tampines,MCT,The nearest is YIS and SBW.Well cant do much either as they got the smallest depot in Singapore.I feel that AM an kope 1 bendy from 800@812 each and replace them with OCs for 171

              <p>deadheading is a waste of fuel such that supp trips are not recommended unless the return trip's load is less than a tenth of the heavier direction. since they have to come back to yishun, just let them come back by normal revenue service with a tighter running time matched with the loading.</p>
              <p>the best way would be to just add a bus on 171 or arrange the supp trip from a YII feeder after having taken care of 10-minute ruling, which means it should be back to supp sometime between 7.20am to 8am, where a three-quarter shift can take over the YII feeder from there or by other methods of headway adjustment.</p>

              <p>Eh you driving or ride?If you drive then you should know that WLDEP is nearer to BPJ rather than BBT.Of course KJDEP is slightly nearer but do you think KJDEP can manage to park all the BPJ services in KJDEP?In the first place why do they need overnight parking at BBT?Its due to no available parking lots for several buses.Why the reasons that 856,852,857 is under WLDEP although they start shift in YIS?Because AMDEP is too small to handle all the Yis services.Guess you take a look at all SMRT Depots after 12.30am and you will understand better.If 106 can be under AM minority control i dun see why they cant handle 3 duties after they left 190.Economical reasons is one thing.Imagine kjdep services os all the way from KJ to MCT.At least a few AM duties will relief some burden there.</p>

              <p>My opinions:</p>
              <p>Service 173:<br>- May become a WAB svc after getting x-fered.</p>
              <p>Service 190:<br>- Its a good idea to have 190 to be fully under KJDEP. AMDEP is just too far away from 190. But can say goodbye to 1042E, 1177A &amp; 634D as those three are under AMDEP.</p>
              <p>Service 75:<br>- SP OCs from AMDEP might become perm for 75 and may become a WAB if KJDEP decides to throw the OCs to 75.</p>
              <p>Service 700/700A &amp; 184:<br>- I feel that WLDEP is better at controlling these two svcs as it can supply many bendies for 700/700A in AM/PM peak rather than just 2 - 3 bendies. Same goes to 184.</p>
              <p>Service 178:<br>- Its about time to have 178 to be partially under KJDEP control. Expect to see DAF on 178 as regular cameos that is similar to 925/927.</p>
              <p>Service 187:<br>- Since most of the perm ELBOs &amp; Striders kena kicked out from 187, i think tht KJDEP OC might replace those buses and thus becoming a WAB svc just like 172.</p>
