If Service 165 is being extend to JE, definitely there are more passengers compared to now and JE int is big enough to accommodate lot of buses compare to the tiny Clementi Int. (always Jam at the bus bay).<br><br>Lastly, one more sugguestion, if Service 111 being extended to Boon Lay Int, and Express 502 being withdrawn, because now express 502 buses are very lously, no more VOs, VSOs or Trident. Whole fleets being controlled by SLdep . If svc111 being extended to cover the entire route of 502. It is better and the fare frm Boon Lay to Orchard Rd is much cheaper than 502,Some more the buses are much better than 502 rather than paying high fare on 502 using O405 buses. Sucks<br><br></div></blockquote>I wouldn't say O405s and 3-axle LOs are lousy buses, only they get boring after some period of time. For Sv. 111 to be extended would be no solution to the parking woes of Boon Lay Int. I really think the interchange should expand to include the field adjacent to it, or even better, build Singapore's first multi-storey bus interchange.</div>
