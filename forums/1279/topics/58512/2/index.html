When TIBS took over Sv. 190 I clearly remember they could not cope with the load and had to send an O405G out together with an O405 trailing one min later, and after 4 mins the cycle repeats.</div>

Even during SBS times Sv. 190 would have a 2-axle VO out every two minutes or so to cope with the load.

Also, with the introduction of service 119, which uses a number of Superbuses which are left running empty during off peak hours. If service 119 don't exist, I think the Superbuses should be staying put on service 74.<br><br>With regards to the long frequency of service 74, sometimes the traffic condition at Lornie Road / Farrer Road is to be blamed.</div>

It runs empty 3/4 of the time, obviously just for showing off. We know SBST very well, don't we? SBST have a bone of contention to pick with services with majority students. Sometimes I'd rather TIBS operate in Bishan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, i dun understand why 165 which used to be a predominantly SD service has become a predominantly DD service when rarely has a DD 165 be filled to the brim before... So unlike 74 when the buses will almost always be filled to the brim in the morning by the time the bus reaches MacRitchie... And can someone enlighten me why there are so many VSOs in operation on service 25? It's not as if it's some special kind of service right... Think 74 deserves better buses lorz...</div>
