You showed the BC you're in a way "friendly"?<br>2. Why are you judging a depot based on only 1 service? :S<br><br>You consider checking cards to be a guideline to rate depot? Not very sensible I believe. You are criticising a depot because of a preventive measure the BCs take. Weird huh? In fact in ALL the buses I took with anyone, loads of people, (from all depots), why is it that I don't see them check cards so crazily as what you describe?<br><br>With the rise of terrorism, imagine if a non-BC were to be staring at a notice for BCs for close to 15 minutes. What would people think? Do not assume that the BCs know of the existence of bus enthusiasts. Remember, some come from Malaysia and have little idea of the Singaporean community. Their only ways to reach out are during their off days, going out to explore (do they have time? I don't know), reading of the papers, conversing with other BCs and perhaps passengers. I really don't think many BCs know so much about a bus enthusiast network around in Singapore, despite the fact that some of the BCs are bus enthusiasts themselves!<br><br>Maybe to help you out a little, smile at BCs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> A smile goes a long long way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well out of the many BCs ive spoken to...this is a rough average opinion of how they find B10TLs ranging between (SBS9800A-SBS9849K)... bus very slow..no strength if bus is packed...bus overall E braking makes bus quite unstable and worst of all if raining and driving the bus u gotta hold the steering tighter than the other models or it will slip off ur control...<br><br>Overall<br>WORST B10TL: brbp: SBS9830M - it seems like no one likes this bus at all...esp BR 31 &amp; 143 BCs<br>WORST B10TL: bndep: SBS9843B - very jerky amid gear changes...and again no one seems to like this bus...esp BN 81 BCs...<br>for amdep cant really point which is the worst..if u guys know..u can share...</div>
