              <p>FYI, I have not been agreeing with bendies as the whole system
              in my past posts because it is going to be unsustainable in the
              long run because Singapore population keeps increasing. Even for
              feeders. It's a matter of time feeder services are going to be as
              congested as those trunk services in the city, as long as people
              are demanding better frequencies and LTA introducing new bus
              services. Just observe how congested Yishun interchange with
              bendies and much less congested it is now, and with more bus
              services and improved frequencies for the current
              services. </p>
              <p>Please refer to my post above to improve 858. Bendies aren't the
              only solution to manage the loads.</p>
              <p>Do you know why the fares dropped? Because the govt is throwing
              money to subsidize the bus fares for the moment. It's not like the
              govt is going to subsidize forever. These 40 bendies are now under
              SMRT and not LTA. Doesn't it occurred to you that in the past, SMRT
              is always the first to apply bus fare hikes?</p>
              <p>You should know the term economics of scale. Why should LTA
              maintain its whole fleet of 12m easily and more cost effectively,
               but pay more to maintain a smaller special fleet at higher
              costs and absorbing these costs? History has tell you maintaining
              small fleets proves costly and these small special fleets are
              normally neglected and left to rot, like Dennis Lances, Darts,
              Tridents, Hinos, CAC Hispanic O405s,  Nissan UDs, just to name
              a few.</p>
              <p>And LTA is standardising the whole fleet of 4,00 0 odd buses to
              make  procurement, maintenance, and switching between
              operators easier and more efficient and flexible in the future. Why
              do you want to make their jobs harder just for these few buses?</p>

              <p>So far 36 is quite manageable. Just that GA needs to add more
              evening trips for 36B.</p>
              <p>The problem of 858 is from Woodlands to Airport. A parallel
              service that I have suggested would help to relieve the loads while
              adding new links. No need to introduce double deckers unless CAAS
              and LTA wants to build a DD-friendly bus terminal. </p>
              <p>27 should now just use a full fleet of low entry buses instead
              of low floor buses. Other than that, it's should be pretty
              manageable with the current frequencies. Still waiting for the
              rumored 137. Probably it can help to relieve 27 loads in
              future. </p>

              <p>The problem of bendies is not just on the roads outside but also
              within bus interchanges and depots. Ever since many bendies are
              scrapped and replaced by more single and double deckers, bus
              operators are able to add more buses to improve frequencies of
              current services and have more buses to introduce more new bus
              services. </p>
              <p>Of course LTA should speed up the trials for the tri-door double
              decker and introduce a fleet as soon as possible for feeder
              services. </p>

              <p>As much as they take a bigger space, they also move off faster. IMO, the reason why the service frequency is being improved is because there is no bendy to replace the deregistering bendy and so the best solution will be to add 2 SD buses so as to not reduce the capacity.</p>
              <p>In cases where DD suit better than bendy, like trunks,no problem - just 1 for 1 and this is indeed a step forward because you saved space on the roads. In cases where DD cant really suit because people dont go up or SDs are used because the route cant use DD, you are indeed replacing a 18m bus by 2X12m buses. It seems like a step forward cos frequency is improved but isnt it infact 3 steps back because you are actually taking more space now, having to hire 2 drivers and also pay double the fuel price. And in the end, this is going to reduce congestion in the interchange? the answer is NO. </p>
              <p>Conclusion: One Size does not fit all problems. Once again, bendy everywhere is not the solution for Singapore. But a small fleet to serve the necessary areas is wise. And this area is short distance feeders and routes with height restrictions.</p>
              <p>And just FYI, all the buses that are still in operator livery still belong to the operators and LTA is so called leasing them for a fee. So it is not like LTA purposely didnt buy over those bendys. All the CDGEs, SBS plated B9TLs (not under BSEP), KUBs, OCs, SMB plated Citaros, A22s (not under BSEP), SBST Plated Citaros (not under BSEP), E500s (not under BSEP), SMB plated A95s, A24s - they are all owned by operators SBST and SMRTB</p>

              <p>From what I observed in Yishun interchange, the bendies do not actually move off faster as you said. Once one or two bendies are stuck at the alighting berth, almost immediately you see a line of buses queuing behind. But the situation is not that bad with single and double deckers on the alighting berth, because shorter buses have more flexibility in moving in and out of lane with many buses.</p>
              <p>One of the main aim for LTA GCM is to improve frequencies for all of the services. 2 single deckers may take up the same spaces of a bendy bus, but at least operators can improve the frequencies by adding more buses, or use more buses for another new service. That's the flexibility they can play with to manage the loads. And two buses doesn't really mean that they will take up the whole space at the same time. Difference in frequencies can allow the two buses to stop at the bus stops at different times and yet improving the frequencies. </p>
              <p>The GCM is still at its early stages and places like Woodlands have not seen much improvements, like more new services, yet compared to other places. LTA may probably reshuffle the feeders there (e.g split into G/W) or add new services to relieve the loads. Parts of Woodlands are still not developed yet and thus new services may be needed in future. </p>
              <p>There are not many places with height restrictions these days and LTA has been removing these barriers since GCM. As for the airport, it's probably time to build a new bus terminal or restructure the bus infrastructures there. With the upcoming T4, Jewel, and T5, there is a need for more bus services, especially one to the west. </p>
              <p>If many other parts of Singapore bus services can operate efficiently without the need of a few special buses, don't see why places like Woodlands cannot improve without the need of bendies. Already seeing great improvements in Yishun, Chua Chu Kang and Bukit Batok with the fleet changes. Like I said earlier, Woodlands estate is still expanding, and it needs more space for more buses for new services. The current arrangement should just be the temporary one for better things to come in future. </p>

              <p>The problem with TPE is that LTA refused to build exit points to Sengkang East areas and move the traffic loads away from Punggol Road exits, thus causing a chokepoint at the bus services stopping at those bus stops.</p>

              <p>FYI, I have not been agreeing with bendies as the whole system
              in my past posts because it is going to be unsustainable in the
              long run because Singapore population keeps increasing. Even for
              feeders. It's a matter of time feeder services are going to be as
              congested as those trunk services in the city, as long as people
              are demanding better frequencies and LTA introducing new bus
              services. Just observe how congested Yishun interchange with
              bendies and much less congested it is now, and with more bus
              services and improved frequencies for the current
              services. </p>
              <p>Please refer to my post above to improve 858. Bendies aren't the
              only solution to manage the loads.</p>
              <p>Do you know why the fares dropped? Because the govt is throwing
              money to subsidize the bus fares for the moment. It's not like the
              govt is going to subsidize forever. These 40 bendies are now under
              SMRT and not LTA. Doesn't it occurred to you that in the past, SMRT
              is always the first to apply bus fare hikes?</p>
              <p>You should know the term economics of scale. Why should LTA
              maintaining its whole fleet of 12m easily and more cost
              effectively,  but have to pay more to maintain a smaller
              special fleet at higher costs and absorbing these costs? History
              has tell you maintaining small fleets proves costly and these small
              special fleets are normally neglected and left to rot, like Dennis
              Lances, Darts, Tridents, Hinos, CAC Hispanic O405s,  Nissan
              UDs, just to name a few.</p>
              <p>And LTA is standardising the whole fleet of 4,00 0 odd buses to
              make  procurement, maintenance, and switching between
              operators easier and more efficient and flexible in the future. Why
              do you want to make their jobs harder just for these few buses?</p>

              <p>I think you are actually very inflexible in changes and keep on harping on one way as a solution. There are actually more solutions with more buses than the current fleet, especially catering into future needs. The solutions are for the future, please think long term.</p>
              <p>Deluded? Rather than wasting your time here ranting at B9TLs here and complaining about useless things, why don't you spend time suggesting to LTA for such improvements, especially when Changi Airport is expanding with two new terminals and a new attraction? The problem is real in the future. </p>
              <p>Just as how they see it in Boon Lay interchange and improved it with a new Joo Koon interchange. </p>
              <p>Improve bus frequencies and add new services when the fleet improves, you complain. Before that, frequencies stretched beyond 15 mins and little incentives for new services, you also complain, ranting LTA giving template answers with no actions.</p>

              <p>With improvements in frequencies with more buses, it doesn't really matter to the commuters as long as they do not have to wait too long for buses. I still hear people complaining about frequencies up to 15 mins for some services for now.</p>
              <p>You have to know that interchanges are getting smaller or least stayed the same but more buses are deployed with more frequencies and new services, and more in future. The new Bukit Panjang and Yishun interchange are going to be smaller and yet new bus services are needed for more upcoming new developments in these estates.</p>

              <p>Are you trying to sidetracking or trying to find more
              faults? </p>
              <p>Is 972 fleet akin to a fleet add to 190 fleet or adding a new
              service under a different fleet?</p>
              <p>A fleet add to current service vs a new service with a new fleet
              is completely different. </p>
              <p>I just again put this into another perspective. If this parallel
              service is packaged to another operator, is this considered a new
              fleet for a new service under another operator or a fleet add of
              SMRT 858?</p>
              <p>If that's the case, might as well consolidate the whole fleet in
              Singapore and call it a fleet add. </p>
              <p>And since you feel that fleet add overall is useless whether it
              is to improve the whole bus system or adding new services or
              improve frequencies is useless, then might as well cut the whole
              fleet to 2,000 buses. Go back to the bus services standards back in
              the 1990s.</p>
