              <p>If that really happens, I am sorry to say that LTA and this
              whole BCM would have been such a disappointment. If they were so
              against bendys in the first place, they should have come up with a
              better solution or else just left it alone and carry on with
              purchasing the MAN A24s exclusively for feeders. When the 3 door DD
              materialised, I really taught LTA was making good progress and that
              with a successful trial, it will be a good alternative candidate to
              the bendy. The thing with feeders is not just capacity alone but a
              solution to allow quick boarding and alighting to reduce dwell
              times. </p>
              <p>If LTA were to just sub 2-door DDs for retiring bendys on
              feeders just so that there will be more space on the roads for a
              few more rich people to drive exotic cars, that's just a failure.
              If the 3 door DD trial were not ready yet, they should have
              considered giving the old bendys a 1 year extension till the trial
              is settled then decide. Put in those 2door DD now, Next time want
              3door DD also not many old buses to replace. </p>

              <p>The problem of bendies is not just on the roads outside but also within bus interchanges and depots. Ever since many bendies are scrapped and replaced by more single and double deckers, bus operators are able to add more buses to improve frequencies of current services and have more buses to introduce more new bus services. </p>
              <p>Of course LTA should speed up the trials for the tri-door double decker and introduce a fleet as soon as possible for feeder services. </p>

              <p>Actually those feeder services will always perform better with the A24s as opposed to DDs. And even more so when newer MRT stations crop up and people travel shorter distances on feeder service buses, with people ever more reluctant to go up. DDs are perfect for trunk routes.</p>
              <p>I just hope LTA does not take one whole loop to find out they were a fool by putting DDs to swap bendys on feeders now and adding buses when they realise that DDs arent enough because the upper deck is empty and eventually realising that a bendy bus that is 6m longer than a normal SD/DD saved more space than 2 SD/DD which is 6m more space than a bendy bus. I would have suggested 13.8m SD 100% low floor 3 Door variants (which is shorter than a bendy and may see better loading patterns than a 12m SD/DD) that are common in Europe but Im not sure if these buses can navigate our narrow roads. SBST's 997 didnt do that well i believe.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I really wonder if those LTA decision makers know what they are doing and if they know the ground well enough.</p>
              <p>On a side note, I secretly do hope that LTA will consider getting some SG plated A24s once all the O405Gs are gone. ATM, DDs are more needed because the current number of bendys even with those going to retire in 2017 removed, SMRT has surplus to run bendys on feeders. Around 60, with the existing 40 will definitely be good to supplement feeders in Yishun, Woodlands, CCK, Airport Services, Service 105 and maybe even 123's extended route.</p>

              <p>Understand your agony,But again what is the solution for feeders that aren't suitable for 12.8m DD?What about Airport svc?Forever spammed with SDs until the terminal jam with buses?LTA can set a rule that bendy buses strictly use for feeders &amp; airport svc not like SMRT gung-ho style of deployment..Those who breached the regulations should be given penalty.</p>

              spammed with SDs until the terminal jam with buses?LTA can set a

              </blockquote>
              <p>Even now 12.8m double deckers are not really introduced, we already see many feeders improving the frequencies with more buses or introduced new services to supplement the loads of the high demand services and yet provide more links with these new services. People are still demanding better frequencies for feeders and more buses are needed.</p>
              <p>I stated before that LTA can introduce a new service to supplement and relieve the loads of 858, just like how 972 was introduced to help 190. This new service can start from Woodlands and ply the same route as 858 and then ply along Gambas Ave, Sembawang Rd, before proceeding to SLE and continue the same route as 858 to the airport. It can provide a faster and more direct link for Woodlands residents to the airport without bypassing Sembawang and Yishun Estates, and also provides a link to Springleaf area for them.</p>
              <p>858 cannot forever rely on bendies as there are other better solutions and there might be possibilities that new services have to be introduced for more people to the airport. So these bendies are not feasible in the airport roads in the long term, since firstly there are limited spaces to park these buses in the airport and secondly, these buses are beginning to block the way of other buses and delaying their schedules, since most of the roads are single lanes. And also bus stops like T3 ones where 858 berth is shifted in the middle and block the other buses at the last berth.</p>
              <p>I just encountered a GA 36 BC who had to horn repeatedly at the bendy in front in T3 as he was running late for the schedule. But the bendy didn't move. In the end, the GA BC has to reverse and squeeze it's way out. Imagine how dangerous for the big bus to reverse in such narrow roads. It could have hit another vehicle behind or mount kerb. </p>

              <p>FYI, I have not been agreeing with bendies as the whole system in my past posts because it is going to be unsustainable in the long run because Singapore population keeps increasing. Even for feeders. It's a matter of time feeder services are going to be as congested as those trunk services in the city, as long as people are demanding better frequencies and LTA introducing new bus services. Just observe how congested Yishun interchange with bendies and much less congested it is now, and with more bus services and improved frequencies for the current services. </p>
              <p>Please refer to my post above to improve 858. Bendies aren't the only solution to manage the loads.</p>
              <p>Do you know why the fares dropped? Because the govt is throwing money to subsidize the bus fares for the moment. It's not like the govt is going to subsidize forever. These 40 bendies are now under SMRT and not LTA. Doesn't it occurred to you that in the past, SMRT is always the first to apply bus fare hikes?</p>
              <p>You should know the term economics of scale. Why should LTA maintaining its whole fleet of 12m easily and more cost effectively,  but have to pay more to maintain a smaller special fleet at higher costs and absorbing these costs? History has tell you maintaining small fleets proves costly and these small special fleets are normally neglected and left to rot, like Dennis Lances, Darts, Tridents, Hinos, CAC Hispanic O405s,  Nissan UDs, just to name a few.</p>
              <p>And LTA is standardising the whole fleet of 4,00 0 odd buses to make  procurement, maintenance, and switching between operators easier and more efficient and flexible in the future. Why do you want to make their jobs harder just for these few buses?</p>

              <p>So far 36 is quite manageable. Just that GA needs to add more evening trips for 36B.</p>
              <p>The problem of 858 is from Woodlands to Airport. A parallel service that I have suggested would help to relieve the loads while adding new links. No need to introduce double deckers unless CAAS and LTA wants to build a DD-friendly bus terminal. </p>
              <p>27 should now just use a full fleet of low entry buses instead of low floor buses. Other than that, it's should be pretty manageable with the current frequencies. Still waiting for the rumored 137. Probably it can help to relieve 27 loads in future. </p>
