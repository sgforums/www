              <p>Still feel that still a small number of people are very biased
              against bendies just like LTA...yes they occupy places when
              stopping but most passengers are happy with that i suppose.
              Furthermore existing yishun n woodlands interchanges are temporary
              n when they move to new or upgraded interchanges in near future
              such congestions wil be solved as they hav more spaces to move.</p>

              <p>Woodland interchange no change in size, just hope for the woodland north interchange to help to relieve the jam (but it will be at least 4-5 years more)..</p>
              <p>yishun new interchange is way way smaller than the current temp interchange.. only 46 parking lots if remember correctly. </p>

              <p>I have seen the floor plan before. It looks smaller with lesser
              lots.</p>
              <p>858 route and deployment itself is already a problem. I already
              stated all the solutions but he keep on insisting his own problems
              on his own solutions. If every airport service demands a bendy
              fleet as the only solution, think the bus queue may stretch and
              delay the whole airport. </p>
              <p>Maybe 972 has higher loadings these days compared to 190, but
              190 still continues to come frequently. At least now no one
              complains can't board 190 anymore.</p>
              <p>Madness or you want to see more people complaining about the
              frequencies of those services?</p>

              <p>858 loading, will need more confirmation.</p>
              <p>wait till you see 190 with A22s or OCs. neither 190 nor 972 should have rigids on them.</p>
              <p>oddly, no one complains of 225. but then again Boon Lay Int is still very small. 180 should need frequency up first not Bendy to DD upgrade. 179 has loadings like 902, however rigids do not even work at all for peak periods at NTU. 241 loading aparently had loading that is heavier than some feeders.</p>

              <p>If you look at the directional basis, TPE jams is caused by the chokepoint at Punggol Road exit that stretches till Tampines Ave 12, if go towards SLE. That is why exits to Sengkang East /Punggol East is needed to divert the traffic away from Punggol Road exits. </p>
              <p>CTE wise is caused by the chokepoint at Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 exit, that stretches to Braddell Rd exits, if you go towards SLE.</p>
