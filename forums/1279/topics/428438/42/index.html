And to make things worse, services like 109 113 163 ever got downgrades from K230UBs to MK3s. Compared to AMK areas, the fleets there are all very new and modern.

              Wanted to post this some time ago but forgot to. I feel that SBST finally made the right decision to install a 4-speed Voith on the Citaros instead of the 6-speed ZF. This will prevent a repeat of the troublesome 60km/h and ZF issues. ZF changes at too low RPMs, which sort of wastes all the power and torque there is. And 6 gears to reach 60 is just absurd, too much power and time lost in between gears. 4 speed is good since you can hear the turbo whistle at 60, not the bogged down sound it'll make if it was at 6th. 
              A question for you guys, is the Citaro limited to 60km/h? Because I know how the engine sounds like at 60 (when I managed to sit in front and look at the speedo), but then I took another Citaro and the engine note was much higher when it seemed to have sped on the highway (couldn't see the speedo as I was sitting at the rear). Maybe it was going faster than 60?

              <p>Remind me why does SLBP needs citaro ? </p>
              <p>They can easily get Mk4 from BBDEP and in return, BBDEP can get Citaros. Look at the number of Wrights SL is taking in and the fact that they are upgrading SD to DD slots. So i think, there is not a need for them to take citaros for now. </p>

              <p>Wanted to post this some time ago but forgot to. I feel that
              <span>SBST</span> finally made the right decision to
              install a 4-speed Voith on the Citaros instead of the 6-speed ZF.
              This will prevent a repeat of the troublesome 60km/h and ZF issues.
              ZF changes at too low RPMs, which sort of wastes all the power and
              torque there is. And 6 gears to reach 60 is just absurd, too much
              power and time lost in between gears. 4 speed is good since you can
              hear the turbo whistle at 60, not the bogged down sound it’ll make
              if it was at 6th.<br> A question for you guys, is the Citaro limited to 60km/h? Because I
              know how the engine sounds like at 60 (when I managed to sit in
              front and look at the speedo), but then I took another Citaro and
              the engine note was much higher when it seemed to have sped on the
              highway (couldn’t see the speedo as I was sitting at the rear).
              Maybe it was going faster than 60?</p>

              <p>Have you taken a ride on the production smrt Citaros less 148T? These uses the newer ZF 6AP1200B 6 speed instead of the old one on 136C.</p>
              <p>I find the smrt Citaro have more Oomph because gearshifts seems much zippier than its sbst siblings, and their larger range of gears gives a smoother engine brake while slowing down. The sbst Citaro engine brake can still be choppy at times, or that could be the bc's lack of experience with the vehicle.</p>
              <p>The Citaro is definately speed governed to 60km/h, using gps to check while on e-way will give the info. What you hear might be possible due to gearbox configuration. On 5-tonners crusing at 50km/h, they can also either run on gear 4 at higher rpms, or gear 5 on lower rpms. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I haven't had the opportunity to take a ride on SMRT's Citaros so I can't really compare. However, I can definitely say that the 4 speed Citaros are extremely smooth with the relaxed gear changes. Regarding the braking performance, it is definitely due to three BC's lack of experience. They can't seem to decide when and how much to brake smoothly. Sad to hear that it's governed to 60. Gone are the days when BCs sped on the highways. Just happened to take a MKIII on 506 the other day and the poor old bus was hitting the rev limiter. Wonder what speed that was. Never heard a MKIII rev so high or worked so hard before.</div>
