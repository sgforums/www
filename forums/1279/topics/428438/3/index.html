              <p><br>From what i observed, alot of people still doesn't know the last row of seats have only 4 instead of 5 seats, plus the engine cover is design below the last 2nd row of seat handles, so from the entrance, people will think there is a seat at the back, so they will move back. Indeed a very clever design for Citaro unlike MAN although it has more seats.</p>
              <p>Everytime if i take a Citaro, i will seat at the engine cover there and observe their movement to the rear. However, after the 300 Citaros are in svcs, i think they might start to stick near to the Exit instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>i wont compare O405s though its the same engine. It has a different bodywork and largely different gearbox. interior materials mostly different though that's not a big issue.</p>
              <p>Why I would compare citaros is its the same for everything except the operator. Like in econs to compare 2 variables u must hold everything else constant and then compare the factor that is variable.</p>

              <p><br>Cant really compare....different body-work, different AC arrangement, different engine, different gearbox. In short: Different bus.</p>
              <p>SMRT's 0405 is updated relative to the SBST one, as well as uprated. SMRT's 0405 engine is rated at 255HP as opposed to SBST's 220HP.</p>
              <p>That's why the difference in performance is actually rather noticeable.</p>

              <p>This argument won't cut any ice with me.</p>
              <p>You know why?</p>
              <p>Its just a friggin bus.</p>
              <p>Get over it.</p>
              <p>And the KUB is comfortable.</p>
              <p>You just have to lower your expectations.</p>
              <p>I take 3 hours of bus rides each day, 3/4 of the time on KUBs
              and have adjusted well to it and found its plus points good
              enough.</p>
              <p>And why in the world do you want to lean your head against the
              window for??? Its little details LIKE THIS (the oily stains) that
              PISS ME OFF to no end. Just imagine having to stare out of
              oil-smudged window for 3hrs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Bottomline: There's 1100 KUBs, you cannot escape la. And do your
              part in being considerate to other commuters. That's more
              useful!</p>

              <p>The KUB is comfortable when u are sitting down, but what about standees? you just need a bc to throw the acclerator once when moving off the bus stop and u can see people almost falling. 3 hours of bus ride, how much of it standing?</p>
              <p>As i said, the most simply way to test if theres any vibration at all is using the windows, if the seats vibrate, needless to say the windows would. I am not asking anyone to lean on windows for your whole trip, but just as an experiment.</p>
              <p>And are you sbst275? why are u replying for him then? Yes the kubs have been improved in countless ways, engine and transmission refined to use less engine braking, brake discs in E5 reduced in size for less powerful braking, better interior layouts. But, for a standing passenger, the ride is still not as comfortable.</p>

              <p>What you are advocating is just gross. Please don't do that.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way. If I have a friend taking bus with me, I am far more likely to be disturbed by oil-smudges than a vibrating bus.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And: Any BC who releases the brake and zham accelerator at once will see people falling. Its no fault of the KUB.</p>
              <p>BCs have also become accustomed to the KUB's fast responding brake-discs and have improved in their moving-off and braking. Its likely you haven't been taking KUBs recently to know this.</p>
              <p>NUS has been using K230UBs on the fantastic slopes and all the stop-and-go operations, but I havent seen anyone fall at <em>every</em> stop like how you describe, despite it being crowded within campus with all the standees you attempt to sympathise with. Most, if not everyone, welcomed the introduction of the K230UB. In fact, the SC K230UB is really nice to take. You should try it. Nice comfy seats and its tuned the same way as the EEV SBST K230UBs. Very smooth.</p>
              <p>I'm not speaking for anybody, nor any type. My take is: Its just a bus....as long as it does not cause my hair to catch fire, my eyeballs to fall off due to vibrations, or bust my eardrum due to noisy radiator during my rides, I'm cool with it.</p>
              <p>Oh btw....you want noisy radiators? Look for some of the B10M MKIV and B9TL and B10TLs. Can't go wrong with that.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, throwing the acclerator is not the same as flooring the acclerator when moving off. Try throwing the clutch on a heavy vehicle, if u ever driven one before.</p>
              <p>To add on, i dont hate taking kubs, i do like it when the ride is smooth and when the bc knows how to control his braking well. The main point im trying to say here, is that the citaro is still, a better bus in terms of comfort when compared to the kub. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I think look no further from the example of the Dennis Trident and the VSO to see what could possibly happen in the future.</p>
              <p>The Trident was considered a superior purchase over the VSO by virtually everyone, including myself. You can see the parallels drawn as far as criticisms levelled at the VSO was concerned: Underpowered, noisy radiator, slow....etc etc.</p>
              <p>Now, if you ask me again, I would pick the VSO over the Trident anyday, unless I'm in the mood for novelty.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Firstly, some of these criticisms were exaggerated. The VSO is not terribly underpowered. Like the K230UB, it is just not well-endowed with power. And it wasn't like the Trident was a lot better in pick-up. Even if it was, it isn't so obvious now. As for noisy radiator......it became quiet once the B9TLs started their roar. The VSOs still sound the same after all these years....at least for most.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the perceived virtues of the Trident were over-rated. The suspension is too soft. There are often BCs who do not appear to be comfortable driving the Trident, given its tendency to bounce and its somewhat faster acceleration, and that makes the bus ride worse. BCs tend to drive more comfortably with the VSO.</p>
              <p>As for comfortness....the VSO wins hands down. Its also not easy to find a Trident with decent aircon, with all of its interior and exterior lights working.</p>
              <p>All in all, the story is this: "Superior" buys can be self-perceived. Mainteinance is also vastly more important. And....give the "inferior" bus a chance....because the VSO is no longer inferior in my eyes anymore. Far from it in fact. The bashings about it not surviving TPE on 161 and 168, or not surviving the full 17 years are unfounded: The VSO is a reliable workhorse which I know usually guarantees nice aircon and suspension. The Trident? I'm not sure. 9671E's EDS backlight has been spoilt for YEARS already but nobody has gotten around to doing anything about it. *shrugs*</p>
              <p>Of course hindsight is always 6/6. Especially when 9844Z's rear wheel fell off at Woodlands Int years ago.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for bodywork, I have to acknowledge that the Trident has a sturdier bodywork, which also draws attention to the fact that people bash the OC500LE and K230UB's "delicate" bodywork, but nobody (these days) say anything about the possibly flimsier Volgren bodywork.</p>
              <p>Says alot about bias sentiments eh?</p>
              <p>Context might be different. Citaro is not likely to have the mainteinance issue faced by Tridents which illustrates economies of scale. But the moral still holds.</p>

              <p>think all the depots will get their fair share , just like the wrights .. </p>
              <p>and internal redeployments will be done</p>
              <p>AM/BR  &amp; SL still have some mercs to clear off , besides the  MK3s in bb/ar/bn/hg .. </p>
              <p>i remember Leyland regos 6xxx haha.. esp the lo2x .. if they use those lo2x 69XX nos again , it would be like coming back to life after 8yrs .. </p>

              <p>The neverending battle between SBST Hardcore and SMRTB gang again.Talk also cannot finish one.There are always passengers who like taking SBST buses and dislike SMRT buses and so on.Maintenance wise is partly about the driver itself.SBST ones especially the young do perform their first and last parade of duties which i salute them.They even dont dare to drive the buses even if the tyres are slightly bald unlike SMRT drivers which explain why some of the buses are in poor condition.Netherless if you ask me between SBST O405 and SMRT ones i choose the latter anytime anyday even if is in poor condition.Use to drive the SBST ones while they're temporary based in HG.As for SBST i see only HGDEP,AMDEP/BRBP and BBDEP/ARBP maintance their buses well and Kranji for SMRT.BNDEP &amp; SLBP can join WLDEP and AMDEP for crap maintenance..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ps:I got a strong feeling that SMRT will buy the facelift version of the Citaro later</p>

              <p>If your comparison are done with buses with the same age then I got nothing to say. I nt sure of other depots but all reported case are attend to, if it is not a major one then it will be rectified at the end of service. </p>
