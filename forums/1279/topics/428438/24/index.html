            <div class='col-md body'><p>I do agree with you on that point. Especially on the improvement of the air-con ducts.  Mercedes Benz should allow some flexibility in this area. Cold air coming out of small holes isn't sufficient to cool the entire interior of the bus. I personally experienced this, as with many other commuters. When i sat at the front, i could feel the cold air. However, as i move towards the rear, it becomes like an oven. At least, the air-con must be able to adjust, for the convenience of commuters.</p></div>

              <p>I'm not defending smrt here, but looking at the way smrt buy vehicles, it seems to show they simply do not want to have fleet expansion. Their recent Annual Report also states the new vehicles for the upcoming 2 years are for fleet replacement and not expansion.</p>
              <p>If they really wanted to maintain their fleet capacity, i guess the earliest that smrt might move to doubledecks will be when they replace their bendies?</p>
              <p>DDs are the way to go, since we're having quite some population growth here and crush loading SD will just make the buses packed and more packed.</p>

              <p>speaking of fleet expansion. i think they have already done their best to cramp buses into their depots as much as possible. if you want to continue on fleet expansion, they might need extra space to park their buses. where to park? along the roadside or @ Heavy Vehicle Parks?</p>

              <p>Yes, they have recently done a fleet expansion finally after 6years with the OC500LEs, but it was really long due.</p>
              <p>As for their depots, their AMK facility is nearing its land lease lifespan soon. If they are really serious about public transportation with buses, an option would be to aquire a nearby land parcle and start building a state-of-the-art facility that's DD capable, and of multiple stories as what KMB has done recently in HK. It takes time and planning, but if they really just want to concentrate on their trains, then there's nothing we can do too.</p>
              <p>Dont forget fleet expansion also has been called for by LTA too. Worse come to worse, alternative parking can also be done at train depots, at least its better than holding back fleet expansion and letting buses to be packed right?</p>
