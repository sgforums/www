              <p>And the remaining lease for AMDEP is 1.7 years as when the Annual Report was published. They probably will renew the lease since it dosent seem that they aquired any new land parcels to build a new depot on.</p>

              <p>Yes, they have recently done a fleet expansion finally after
              6years with the OC500LEs, but it was really long due.</p>
              <p>As for their depots, their AMK facility is nearing its land
              lease lifespan soon. If they are really serious about public
              transportation with buses, an option would be to aquire a nearby
              land parcle and start building a state-of-the-art facility that's
              DD capable, and of multiple stories as what KMB has done recently
              in HK. It takes time and planning, but if they really just want to
              concentrate on their trains, then there's nothing we can do
              too.</p>
              <p>Dont forget fleet expansion also has been called for by LTA too.
              Worse come to worse, alternative parking can also be done at train
              depots, at least its better than holding back fleet expansion and
              letting buses to be packed right?</p>

              <p>who know with the change in the minister/policy etc etc, we might see SMRT give up on their bus operations etc? or the govt might be announcing some subsidies soon that why they are holding back .. guess there must be something going on right now which we are not aware of after so many complains...</p>
              <p>and a lof of public keep on asking for competition and ask for more companies to provide bus public transports. the barriers of entry is so high? how many buses you need to buy at a start? 200? where to hire all the BCs/maintainence personal etc etc.. do u think some company will spend S$100 million to buy buses to provide public transport service and then when they ask for S$0.01 increase in bus fares, kenna complain right in the face? and if buses were late by 1 min, kenna complain again.. seriously i dun think any one will bother to join to provide bus services here...</p>
              <p>I think they would rather go spend that S$100 million on some other business (say maybe taxi?). S$100 million can buy more than 1000 taxis for the company to earn good income liao and no need to worry about drivers etc.. just give better rental rates and drivers will come to you.</p>

              <p>Yup, i too agree with you that they should build a new multi-story depot nearby with spare capacity. Even if its not doubledeck friendly, thats ok because the way they cram buses into their depots every night now is simply dangerous. Unfortunately, they dont seem to be willing to pour more money into bus operations that dont really make money.</p>

              <p>We just have to wait and see if anything is going to be done with regards to subsidies and such. It's possible as per what you mentioned about complains not being resolved.</p>
              <p>With regards to the cost of entry into public transport, those points are valid points. I believe LTA/PTC is trying to move us towards how buses in london is being operated. For example, in london: routes tendered to different company and bidded for. buses are purchased by companies themself, and they have to meet key performance targets and goals, fares are also controlled by tfl. This is very similar to what we are moving towards.</p>
              <p>However, there's a very critical point that we are different from london. Compare the fares. Their fares start from £1.30 (about SGD$2.60), and is capped at £4(about SGD$8) per day. Our fares is not even of comparison to theirs. This is probably why there are many companies willing to buy new buses and bid for routes, because its relatively easier to recoup operational costs.</p>
              <p>I do not think that our fares should increase, but as per what you have mentioned, the govt might need to provide some subsidies or incentives in order for the private sector to be willing to fork out money and run public transport.</p>
