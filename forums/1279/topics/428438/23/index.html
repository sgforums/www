              Actually I still think it is good enough to cater the loads and it works like the older generation buses like the Scania N113CRBs, Mercedes Benz O405s and Volvo B10Ms. 
              I don't really support peak hour crash loads these days as the front area can be so crowded that it is so hard to get off the bus. I still prefer the older buses designs which tends to be less crowded.
              But I observed that some of the older people like the full low floor design and claim to have more seats than the current WAB single deckers. But I think SBST should seriously improve the air con system and the bell design.

                  Move up is one issue. 
                  Move down is another issue. There aren't much grabpoles like the double decker staircases and double decker staircases faces backwards, so falling down is not very often while climbing down.
                  But WAB buses are different, when people alight, they climb down forward facing, which is in tandem in the direction the bus is moving. And it gets quite unstable for buses like Scania K230UBs and Mercedes Benz OC500LEs to a lesser extend. I have seen several occasions people almost fell or fell down the 2 steps. Having a full low floor is not a requirement but it is certainly a plus. One step up is still better, than 2.

              But I feel the gradient of slope from the rear door onwards can be a bit higher, which makes climbing to the steps with seats much easier. 
              Hope that Mercedes Benz will look into this for the Citaro 2 model and put in optional air con ducts for tropical countries markets as well. The factory fitted air con ducts don't work well in tropical climates.

              Regardless whether it is the driver issue or not, having stepless or the most one step is much better than having 2 steps up. And many people are complaining about it too.

              I think the first intention is for easy access to get on and off the seats easily with the back wall facing seats so that you don't have to move your body to let the one sitting inside to get out. But it sacrifice a number of seats, else the side to the doors might be able to hold 2 more seats and the side to the PIW area can seat 4 people instead of 3, if using conventional forward facing seats.
