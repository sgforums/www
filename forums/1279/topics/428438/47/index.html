              <p>I find it a nuisance that you are putting these Citaros as perm 53 without evidence at all. Yes, they might be on 53 for quite some time for the past couple of weeks, but how in the world are you going to confirm that they are perm? Only 53 and 138 has Citaros for sure everyday so far, so where else do you think they can let the newly-released Citaros come out on the roads and do some runs first?<br><br>If you say that they are perm, do they have any perm stickers? I can tell you for most of those in this list that you are saying is perm 53, i can say for sure that i hadn't see any perm stickers anywhere on these buses at all. Heck, even the first few like 6011E and 6012C still have no stickers, but they are still seen everyday on 53?</p>
              <p><br>And even if they do have perm stickers, show me the bus that is out. Stop chanting that this is perm, that is perm just because they have perm stickers. There's no point in saying that they are perm when you can't find the buses that are out from the service. It's like leaving your sentence hanging in mid-air. </p>
              <p>The Citaros on 53 are simply running around on whichever slots that are missing a bus, because the 53 KUB is out cameoing somewhere. <br><br>And its crazy to think that there's such a large amount of Citaros perm, when there's at least 7 KUBs on 53 still with their ad contracts. </p>
              <p>Can you use your eyes and properly observe which buses are missing first for a long time before you deduce any deployments? Not only for 53, but for whichever service you are posting on the Redeployments thread.</p>
              <p>I'm sure i'm not the only one here who's getting irritated of you anyhow posting &amp; editing deployments (before you were banned on SGwiki) just because you want to be the deployments guy. Open your eyes BIG and see first before talking. </p>

              <p>What I'm trying to say is, if that service is not within your reach, then don't try to overstretch yourself. Let the people who actually live along the route or take the service daily, or have reliable insider info (like Oceane) to post the deployments, while you concentrate on the ones that's near your area. That's what most of us do anyway.</p>
              <p>Let those who know what they are talking about post the deployments, instead of anyhow posting then get shot down by others in the end. Because they are the ones who confirm will see the service and take the service everyday.</p>

If that person has the insider info, he will post it on this forum, if he wishes to share here.<br>And anyway, you don't have to physically stay near that area to take the service? You could be taking that bus service everyday to work or school, but does that mean i necessarily have to stay near where i board the bus from?<br>Honestly, there's no point in rushing to post the deployments just for the sake of it. Confirm what there is going in and going out first then post, after letting the fleet settle down for alittle first and then observe the changes.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you will just seem like a troublemaker that cannot be trusted to those who know what is exactly going on with that service, and then they'll just crticise you like nobody's business.</p>
              <p>I'm just reflecting the situation that is getting out of hand. Messy deployments by a user who just wants to post whatever he thinks is true without any reliable info is just going to create confusion for everyone else who uses the wiki or checks the forum.</p>
              <p>It's time to really think of the interests of everyone else on the whole who might be using the wiki, and not just your self-prestige of  increasing the post count or appear as the deployments pro.</p>

              <p>How would you define  "reliable insider info"? SBS Transit is definitely not going to give its stamp of approval.</p>
              <p>Certainly not when posters were seen at interchanges that redeployments, rosters, timesheets, departure times, inspector tickets and even the type of shift are now out of bounds to public.</p>
