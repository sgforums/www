              <p>I do hope to see 163 can provide better service in Anchorvale and Fernvale as it's the main service serving residents there. 163 had KUBs many years back and I thought 163 is WAB hopeful, only till recently replaced by non-WAB buses, which was a disappointment. SBST really have to look into the amount of PIW in that area, although Anchorvale and Fernvale are relatively new estates, but that doesn't mean that no PIW living around that area. There are quite some 2-rooms &amp; 3 rooms around this area, and quite a lot are shifted here from old estates. Also doesn't mean that PIW don't live in 4-rooms and 5-rooms too. So the more that they have to better the service of 163.</p>
              <p>MKIII may be crappy as it seems, but it had served us a good 17+ years. HG keeping it for now most probably due to they wanted to use them till very last day. They will sure leave us one day, and Citaro might have the chance to replace it's position on HG services. We might have to be patient on this matter, there will be no point arguing and make things ugly here. Like what I've said earlier, we are all literated bus fans right? :)</p>
              <p>Bro Mercrox, from your nick, can see that you are a supporter of Merc buses. MKIII is a good bus, but then, that doesn't mean MKIII will stay for long. They will eventually go one day, but they don't haunt. I doubt you wanna being wake up in the middle of the night by a MKIII roaring beside your bed bah? :)</p>
              <p>Life is short, enjoy and cherish while we can. Let's just open our heart to welcome new buses and get ready to bid goodbye to those retiring ones.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>Till now I still dun really understand why service 163 is still not declared WAB, same goes for 156. It was one of the earliest Sengkang services to get K230UB perms together with 119 and 156 way back in May 2008. I believe it was due to the bus stop infrastructure between YCK Road (after AMK Ave 6 junction) to Upp Thomson (after Sin Ming junction). The bus stops along Sengkang stretch shouldn't have any issues for PIWs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">.</p>
              <p>Service 86 that plies along the same stretch along YCK Road to Sengkang got its 1st K230UB from AMDEP a few months later than 119/156/163, and it has been declared WAB liao.</p>

              <p><br>Till now I still dun really understand why service 163 is still not declared WAB, same goes for 156. It was one of the earliest Sengkang services to get K230UB perms together with 119 and 156 way back in May 2008. I believe it was due to the bus stop infrastructure between YCK Road (after AMK Ave 6 junction) to Upp Thomson (after Sin Ming junction). The bus stops along Sengkang stretch shouldn't have any issues for PIWs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">.</p>
              <p>Service 86 that plies along the same stretch along YCK Road to Sengkang got its 1st K230UB from AMDEP a few months later than 119/156/163, and it has been declared WAB liao.</p>

              <p>that's why i am worried abt 156 too. 4/8 got 3 KUB cameo on other svc!</p>
              <p>156 i think is along YCK rd again. the incline was as steep as 35 degrees after the AMK ave 3/HG ave 2 X. but svc like 43 and 76 are also there, so same issue with 86 on YCK rd(which i just knew you would mention it). i think it is unreasonable for SBS to give me an answar like that when i am asking for more WAB on 163.</p>
              <p>BTW, took 8389 tdy, and hope can be replaced, becoz the engine is roaring like mad and the bus stank of salted fish(though i canno find any on board).</p>

              <p><br>If I am not wrong service 156 might be due to 6th Avenue. But it doesn't serve much difference anyway. But look at service 174, it still can go WAB though the whole stretch of Old Jurong Road are not PIW friendly.</p>

              <p><br>Till now I still dun really understand why service 163 is still not declared WAB, same goes for 156. It was one of the earliest Sengkang services to get K230UB perms together with 119 and 156 way back in May 2008. I believe it was due to the bus stop infrastructure between YCK Road (after AMK Ave 6 junction) to Upp Thomson (after Sin Ming junction). The bus stops along Sengkang stretch shouldn't have any issues for PIWs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">.</p>
              <p>Service 86 that plies along the same stretch along YCK Road to Sengkang got its 1st K230UB from AMDEP a few months later than 119/156/163, and it has been declared WAB liao.</p>

              <p>Doubtfully that any bus-stops that 163 plies is WAB unfriendly, all are upgraded bus-stops along the way. But at least now can see that 87 is WAB hopeful since HG deployed plenty of Wrights on it.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
