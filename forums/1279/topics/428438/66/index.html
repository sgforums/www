              <p>Poor buses, the Germans never intended for them to be worked that hard. I sort of like the strange sparking sounds the SBST Citaros make. And I just realised the SBST Citaros seem to have extremely high ground clearance, higher than the SMRT counterparts. And the suspension is extremely soft too and comfy. It rolls too much when cornering though; seems like the only single decker that feels like there's a possibility of a roll over when taking sharp highway exits at 60km/h (like 53 exiting from TPE to KPE).</p>

              <p>yeah Rizal said that abt SBST Citaros having higher ground clearance than their SMRT cousins... perhaps thats why SMB142J bottomed out on a speed bump near BPJ... that was a really ouch experience for me...</p>
              <p>But I wonder why, or is it just me, that ever since the intro of Citaros on 53, the big hump leading out of CGA Terminal 2 basement seemed to have gotten itself a few more scratch marks...</p>

              <p>I apologize for my ignorance, but who's Rizal? And poor SMB142J. That's what happens when you drive too fast over a hump. Once saw sparks from a KUB on 34 hitting the ground at a traffic junction that happened to be quite bulgy. The scratch marks shouldn't be from the Citaros since they have much higher ground clearance. Maybe it's the SMRT OCs.</p>
              <p>And another thing, I seem to notice that the newer buses including the KUBs, Wrights and Citaros all seem to have some kind of "ski-looking" things at the four corners of their bodies. Is it to prevent bodywork damage in the event of hitting the ground at high speeds due to bumps?</p>

              <p>Yes, the 4 "legs" below are to preven the base from direct scratch when it bumps to the road and it can help prevent any cracks to any pipes connecting the bus.</p>

              <p>Ironically, after that, I took 9214S on 161 and its also on that list now because of its 15 degrees aircon.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

                  Totally agree, all these whining are getting some of us on the nerves. Besides, I am glad we have our Wright, Citaro and now the MAN buses to make bus life in SG more interesting for all of us.Lastly, its much easier for me to avoid a particular lousy piece of scrap metal. :)

              <p>For folks like me who have to takan 3 hrs of bus rides every weekday, I can tell you the Citaro is definitely not on the top of my list. Far from it in fact.</p>
              <p>Considering that I post that one on a wet day, with temperatures outside hovering around 28 degrees, and I still can tell you that its hot inside, something is very wrong!</p>
              <p>The aircon is very weak. You have to be delusional to tell me that the bus is comfortable unless you are a honey bee which can tolerate temperatures in excess of 38 degrees.</p>
              <p>Adequete?</p>
              <p>I suppose I can't generalise from a single ride, but there's too many complaints about the aircon to ignore.</p>
              <p>Need me to do hypothesis testing to tell you if the complaints are statistically significant?</p>
              <p>If so, Charles, what would you have to say?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
