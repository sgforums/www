              <p>To be honest, I dont see a need that 951E starts at my neighbourhood. I can bet that people chose to take 911E or 858 than 951E coz there will be jam at SLE/CTE area thus people preferred taking MRT although its congested.</p>

              <p>there are premiums using the SLE/CTE combo as well and 982E/850E are NOT spared from congestion, nothing can be completely spared from congestion, have you even taken these routes and calculated the demand? why do people take 982E when they have 190 and train? why do people take 971E when there's 700 and 190? 951E's introduction is timely, the route is not perfect but good enough targetting one of the most populated areas in woodlands (and yes i live along 911 and 951E's route)</p>

              <p>I dont have a reason to take these routes at all plus i have done my own calculations it is slightly cheaper for me to take 911 and take MRT to CBD than taking 951E from my house to CBD. But fine its up to the user's financial status to take this premiums or not but if me i still choose the old way because i have experience being late coz i got stuck in jam at 8am along the SLE/CTE route wich is a bad experience for me.</p>

              <p>its also cheaper to take 190/700 to the city compared to 971E.... but the greatest mystery is why 971E buses are still bursting at the seams even with more trips eh?? and you aren't even working yourself... most people working in shenton way can more than afford the express fare to the cbd every day anyway.</p>

              <p>1 Feeder, 1 Trunk and other 3 Express? That's all they can
              offer?</p>
              <p>Look at SBST, 7 services.</p>
              <p>6 trunks, only 1 express. SMRT can go jia poon.</p>

              <p>You ask yourself first, what full day route can SMRT produce?</p>
              <p>I think most area(SMRT region) already covered by current service. </p>

              <p>I dont have a reason to take these routes at all plus i have
              done my own calculations it is slightly cheaper for me to take 911
              and take MRT to CBD than taking 951E from my house to CBD. But fine
              its up to the user's financial status to take this premiums or not
              but if me i still choose the old way because i have experience
              being late coz i got stuck in jam at 8am along the SLE/CTE route
              wich is a bad experience for me.</p>

              <p>We may think transfer is easy and cheaper, but I don't think people would love to transfer and transfer(it's kinda troublesome). Yes I agree that it's cheaper using the old ways, but I also feel that it's kinda troublesome when you have 1 svc at your doorsteps bringing you to CBD(your workplace) straight away. (:</p>
              <p>I feel that the CBD area covered seems to be lesser for 951E. If possible, I think LTA should put up a survey in the area covered by 951E and plan out the route to meet most of their answer. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually the city portion of the route is the same as 850E. What I find needs improvement is the overcrowding of bus stop bays at Hub Synergy Pt and bus stops along Robinson Rd in the evening. A lot of premium services run by private buses collect cash and give change from almost every boarding passenger, taking up a long time at the bus bay. Promoting one public transport mode at the expense of other modes is going to bring us back to square one.</p></div>

              <p>Hmm..what I feel is that 120/141 are needed as they link from place to place that no svc have done so, especially 141. 116 wise I'm not sure, but I guess it benefits those staying inbetween the route or AMK/YCK RD to travel to Hougang/Serangoon easily? </p>
              <p>What trunk svc for Yew Tee/Bukit Gombak? How is it run? </p>
              <p>There's 962/858 connecting already to Woodlands Admiralty Town, or even the MRT. Just came to my mind, if you suggested that this svc from Sembawang will run parallel to the MRT track to Woodlands Ave7, turn to Ave2 and up to SLE/BKE till Bukit Gombak, probably possible. But on the other hand, how many people would take? OR Sembawang can get a full day svc running to New Bridge Road(allowed?) via Woodlands or so.</p>
              <p>Hmm they can actually convert 850E to full day svc since it's also start from Ring Rd, but probably a different route instead? With 850 as the svc. Can terminate at Marina Centre. But likewise, I feel that it's kinda low demand :x</p>
              <p>So the new Woodlands intra-town terminates where? :o I'm thinking of having 1 that connects to Waterfront, probably if NPark would to have a terminal for this intra-town, probably that would be better. </p>
