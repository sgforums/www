            <div class='col-md body'>Well, many people will go crazy over anything for no rational reason; it's not just buses - there's fictional characters, the military, cars, etc.. Same for me - if you ask why I like buses, I don't know how to really answer you, because in part my liking of buses is irrational.<br><br>Maybe it's because of the variety of buses out there (which I find fascinating), combined with exposure since young (I have been using buses since a child, and even before I became a full-fledged bus user (my father once had a car of our own), I have been making note of them - maybe they stand out because of their larger size. I have, since young, wanted to take every single possible bus model out there (which I almost acheived - I never got the chance to take SBS 81S, the Leyland Lynx, SBS' Nissans, and I still am unable to get on board TIB 838H, TIB 905Y, TIB 1024H, and TIB 890E) to experience what it's like to ride on one of those models.</div>

Hmm , maybe all i can tell you is that we grew up with buses since young , therefore we gradually like buses . There are people who kept their childhood toys until when they are adults . Reason being that the toy holds a memento to them .<br><br>"Why would someone want to spend over $100 on models of buses?" :<br><br>Thats because , firstly , bus models dont come cheap . They cost roughly $40 per model (detailed and good ones) , depending on the scale and size . Secondly , maybe collecting bus models allows them to see "buses" everyday , without having seeing the real ones . Just like me , altho i dont collect bus models . I collect construction machine models instead . I spent a total of $200+ on it . Reason being that i hardly see any excavators everyday . So collecting such models allows me to "see" them .

We moved out in 1986. The bus terminal is just a 5 minutes walk. Back then, the services there were 13 and 20. I get to travel very often as I follwed my grandmother around. Before the introduction if the One Man Operation system, you would take a look at the timekeeper's office to see which is the next bus. Then you just go up, sit down and wait for the driver and conductior. Most often, you don't have to because there were people already in the bus. I don't know why but the drivers would leave the front door open during the journey. Maybe they feel hot. Or maybe they can't be bothered to open and close the door all the time. But then, they always close the exit door. Hmm...</div>

Some have loud howling noises, some make queer hissing sounds, some even whistling sounds. Sometimes, the sounds are unique for a particular type of bus. I enjoy listening to the sound and it sometimes puts me into a calm and relaxed state of mind.</div></blockquote>The ZF howl on the SMRT's Merc O405 and many Voiths are the easiest to imitate ! Especially the SMRT's Merc ! I enjoy imitating their howling noise !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
