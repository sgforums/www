              <p>Hello all</p>
              <p>I would like to introduce SingaporeBus (<a href="https://projects.forum.nokia.com/SingaporeBus">https://projects.forum.nokia.com/SingaporeBus</a>):<br>An application to help find nearby bus stops, bus arrival times and bus itineraries in Singapore, based on information extracted from publictransport@sg, Iris next bus and TransitLink online services. Includes map and paths of the bus services. Developed for N95 but the app should be compatible with most touch and non-touch Symbian S60 phones (Nokia, SonyEricsson, Samsung...).</p>
              <p>So far the application has only been tested with N95 and on the s60 emulators (3rd edition FP1/2 and 5th edition). Please share your successfull and unsuccessfull experiences here or on the project homepage!</p>
              <p>SingaporeBus is totally free (except carrier charges if you use packet data of course...) and is open source. If anyone's interested I would more than welcome volunteers to help grow and maintain the application as I will soon have less free time.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>Wah ^_^</p>
              <p>This is actually going to be useful if it's good...gonna install it now.</p>
              <p>The SelfSigned version doesn't work for me. So I'm downloading the unsigned one and signing it myself.</p>
              <p>For anyone that has problems installing/wants to install, here are some basic steps:</p>
              <p>1. Download "SingaporeBusUnsigned.sis" from the files page.<br>2. Go to <a href="https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do">https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page/public/openSignedOnline.do</a><br>3. FIll in the form with your IMEI Number, Email and Application. IMEI number can be retreived by typing *#06# on your phone.<br>4. Wait.<br>5. Download the signed app that is sent to your email.<br>6. Install.<br></p>

              Hi n4l, thanks for trying the app and for the directions to use open signed!
              
              The SelfSigned version should have worked! Please let me know your device model and which error you are getting (upon installation I'm guessing, not upon running the application?)

              Although I am not 100% convinced, one reason for the failure could be unappropriate UID - I understand Selft Signed application should use unprotected UIDs and this was not the case for v1.1.0. Unfortuntely I don't have any FP2 or 5th edition device at hand to confirm that (everyone has iphones these days in Singapore :D).
              
              Anyway, v1.1.1 is now released with unprotected UID for the Self Signed version. If anyone still has issues installing this version, please send me the error message you get!

              <p>nice to see such a good symbian bus arrival app. Where is the open source code? I may want to take a look, the design look cool on the journey planner.</p>

              Hello
              
              n4l: Thanks for your patience and detailed error message. The problem was due to inappropriate capabilities, v1.1.2 solves the issue (this time I tested the release on Nokia's Remote Device Access and it does install fine). Note that SelfSigned and OpenSigned versions can't coexist so one must always be uninstalled before the other can be installed.
              
              SBS7322B: Thanks for trying out the app, and sorry for your bad experience. Could you please mention the model of your phone?
              I could not reproduce the problem in the emulators or on several devices at Nokia's Remote Device Access. During exit, the application tries to delete log files, that's the only part where I think it could get stuck. I have added stronger checking around the log deletion code in v1.1.2, but I cannot guarantee it will solve the problem. I usually do not have second look at applications which crash but your feedback will be most appreciated if you still have the heart to experiement ;)
              
              Yong Reader: Thanks for your feedback.
              I have been using yongbus few times and have been impressed at the speed and ease of use. Keep up the excellent work! I think web apps have much brighter future than standalone apps, hope the trend towards standalone apps ends soon :)
              The cource code is on the project homepage in the [Source] tab.
              Direct link to the code: https://projects.forum.nokia.com/SingaporeBus/browser
              You would be most welcome to contribute to SingaporeBus, let me know if interested! :)

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Some suggestions:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>When opening the app, the first menu's right softkey link should be exit instead of map - that's the functionality of most apps... :)<br><br></li>
              <li>Display only the nearest 10 bus stops unless requested for, loading the entire list is annoying at times... (especially since the GPS isn't that accurate - see next point)<br><br></li>
              <li>Possible to let the app try and resolve AGPS (say give 10 seconds) first then use any other geolocation method? The method that usually works first is horribly inaccurate and anonying at times. For e.g., I load the app, it uses the default (presumably Google) method, and it shows the bus stop opposite me or something else (just <em>not</em> the bus stop I know I'm at), by the time I locate and select the correct bus stop, the one I am at would have been resolved using AGPS - so it might be better to just let the app attempt using AGPS first.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>That's all atm :).</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              Hi n4l
              
              Thanks for your suggestions, good to see that you are very detailed about this app and want to make it better.
              
              * Before getting maps and routing, right soft key in SingaporeBus was also Exit. I switched to Map because it is more convenient in my typical usage of the application, instead of going into Options menu, etc. in order to show the map. Exiting the app is always possible with the red end call key. I agree however that being non standard is not ideal and I would welcome any alternatives/suggestions which would still provide quick access to the map (it's a convenience app so it should be as easy, fast and straightforward to use as possible).
              
              * I guess your concern is related to ease of use (not performance)? It is always possible to go the top of the list by pressing the left navigation key (there are several shortcuts in almost all screens). I feel that displaying first 10 bus stops would introduce complexity in the usage (need to think of the behavior of the search field and the favourite view, need to introduce new menu options, ...), whereas displaying the whole list feels simpler to understand. Let me know your opinion.
              
              * The app queries the 3 positionning methods (google, network and "all methods supported by the device" - not specifically GPS) at the same time (not one method after the other - was it your understanding?). The app then shows/uses the best available position at any point of time (similar to google/ovi maps). The problem I have with this procedure is that while browsing the list of nearby bus stops, the screen will jump everytime a position method resolves a position, which is confusing (is this your problem too?). Unfortunately I can't think of any better procedure. Since all positioning methods are simultaneous, waiting 10 seconds for GPS before querying netowrk positioning and google positioning does not seem to provide any benefit. Again, your input and suggestions/alteranives are very much welcome!
              
              
              Cheers!

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <ul>
              <li>For me, exiting the app with the red call key means to place it into background (i.e. consume resources), although your app exits instead of placing it into background, it feels weird because it's non-standard. I suppose placing it into the left soft key's manual would do good (perhaps as a first option or something).<br><br>The point was just a thought on my head in case you didn't think of that, what the soft key should do is up to you though - I'll just get myself acquainted with it. <br><br></li>
              <li>Yes, with regards to ease of use. I never knew about the left soft key button, so I'm gonna use it now :)<br><br>As a programmer (unfortunately not a Nokia QT one, otherwise I would be glad to help) I would understand that it's simply "easier" to show all the bus stops, however it can be a pain for an end-user.<br><br>Speaking of which, on the search function that you have, maybe it would be good to implement it in the home screen of your app (first screen) at the bottom where there would be a small bar for users to use (something like the Contacts App). It should search road names/bus stop codes/substrings of bus stop names (iirc, there was once I used it and it doesn't search for substrings).<br><br></li>
              <li>Yes, that's the exact problem I'm facing, the screen jumping around. Hence suggesting that an attempt at GPS resolving be done first before querying the rest since it's potentially the most accurate.<br><br>My understanding at is as long as GPS has successfully resolved, it would be the most accurate positioning possible, so that removes the need of doing a network + google positioning - saving some unnecessary data usage + frustration on the user's end.<br><br>Additionally, in any case, if I were to use Network/Google, it results in an usually inaccurate positioning (Google positioning has estimated weird locations for me before and honestly I've rarely gotten accurate readings from those 2) and I've to spend 5-10 seconds finding that bus stop I'm at (and possibly risking a jumping situation as mentioned). It'd be better to spend 5-10 seconds to resolve an accurate GPS reading - saving the frustration of search.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Cheers :)</p>

              Hello n4l
              
              * I agree, I am also used to red call key placing apps into background instead of closing them. I initially did not pay attention to this behavior because I did not code it. After some research it seems to now be the new expected behavior(http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/KIS000294_-_Call_termination_key_behavior_has_changed) and the IDE (Carbide) automatically generates the code to comply to that behavior. To place the application into the background there's now always the menu key :)
              
              * The search function should search substrings, could you check again? One thing to keep in mind though when searching is that the database is full of abbreviations such as "rd" for road, "jln" for jalan, etc. 
              With a device with a keyboard, such as yours I believe, you can just start typing and the search field will show immediately (there's no need to go into Options &gt; Search, this menu option was added for touch devices). I have added to the application homepage the list of all the shortcuts in each screen.
              
              * Regarding showing less bus stops, I can understand it could make the application easier to use in certain cases. But I fear it can also make the application less intuitive or quick to use in other cases. Furthermore, as you guessed it would be a big development due to the way the app is currently written :) The app is written in Symbian C++ with native avkon controls which are extremely painful to use in my experience. That's one of the reason there are only very few screens in SingaporeBus. With the many ideas you have, you would be much welcome to participate in the development of the app!!
              
              * Regarding the jumping screen, I definitely want to resolve this issue but I am still thinking of the best solution. GPS is the most accurate but it sometimes takes long to complete (more than 10s), it does not always work (indoors), and some devices do not have it. Even if the app could detect whether a GPS is available, with a 10s timeout I don't like that you need to wait that long in order to use the application (maybe you do not care about your current location, you actually want to do a search). And after 10s, what should the app do, query for google and network and cancel the GPS to avoid confusion due to a later GPS position?
              
              SingaporeBus v1.2.0 has just been released with some improvements over the jumping screen issue. The basic idea is that the app will maintain the selected bus after a new position is resolved. this should help with the screen jumping but is not a definitive solution.
              
              Cheers!

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Interesting, never knew that it's the "expected behaviour" now. Most of my 3rd party apps still background instead of closing when I press the red call button...<em>the irony</em>.<br><br></li>
              <li>On the search function, I was referring to specific cases like perhaps "Novena Church", where sometimes I'd type Church instead of Novena. In this case, the result I'm looking for wouldn't appear :)<br><br></li>
              <li>Yeah, I understand where you're coming from. I know someone in particular who likes the ability to see all the bus stops (and the distance). Hahaha. Perhaps an option could be in place for this? :)<br><br>I'm looking into going into Symbian development just for tryouts sake sometime when I'm free :), so I'll help out if I can.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Cheers  (just updated to 1.2.0 btw).</p>

              <p><span>SBS7322B</span>: Thanks for trying out the app,
              and sorry for your bad experience. Could you please mention the
              model of your phone?<br> I could not reproduce the problem in the emulators or on several
              devices at Nokia’s Remote Device Access. During exit, the
              application tries to delete log files, that’s the only part where I
              think it could get stuck. I have added stronger checking around the
              log deletion code in v1.1.2, but I cannot guarantee it will solve
              the problem. I usually do not have second look at applications
              which crash but your feedback will be most appreciated if you still
              have the heart to experiement <img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"></p>

              v1.3.0  is out with (among other changes) n4l's suggestion to first try the GPS fo N seconds, before resorting to network and google position. N = 0 by default (so by default the feature is disabled), but it can be increased in the application settings. N4l, please let me know your feedback and whether this is what you were thinking to. Upgrade can be done from the application itself (if it's SelfSigned only) in Settings &gt; Options &gt; Check for update.
              
              SBS7322B, I am the sorry one, I have no idea where the bug is and I could not reproduce it on any nokia I tested so far. To help troubleshoot this issue I have added better logs to v1.3.0, especially in the exit sequence. If you're still keen to experiment, could you install v1.3.0, start the app, enable logs in Settings &gt; Options &gt; Enable logs, then close the app (which will hang your phone), restart your phone, and again start the application. On this 2nd startup the application will copy the log file into X:\Data\SingaporeBus\TraceFile.txt where X is the drive letter where you installed the app (C/D/E/etc.). If you could send me this file, this should hopefully enable me to identify and correct the bug. But I know that's a lot of trouble since it requires 2 restarts of your phone!
