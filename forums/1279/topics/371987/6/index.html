Good environmental and fuel performance as well as high vehicle and service quality were crucial factors behind the choice of Scania as a bus supplier.</p>
              <p><strong>The single largest order is from Singapore, where operator SBS transit has ordered 200 more buses for delivery between November 2009 and May 2010.</strong> Since 2007, SBS Transit has ordered a total of 1,100 city buses from Scania, making the company one of Scania's biggest bus customers in the world today.</p>

              <p>The Elbos are the worst failures, followed by Scania L113CRL (SMRT). These 2 models though younger than the MBO405, already looked so haggard and the engines seemed to be in poorer condition.</p>

              <p><br>In the 1st place the elbos were not meant to be aircon buses. Tibs converted them in 2001 so as to achieve an entire fac fleet. Elbos had not even reach 15 yrs lifespan yet go on layup already lolx.</p>
              <p>So far the 0405s r the most reliable smrt buses on the road, but sad to say tat doesn't include the bendies.</p>
              <p>Umw lances is another of smrt's fleet which r poorly maintained as well, and if i m not wrong there were also lances like 931X n 936H tat ever caught fire n was deregistered in the early days?</p>

              <p>I believe in majority of accidents, the extent of damage is due
              to the impact of collusion and not so on the bodywork. Speed,
              amount of force, size &amp; type of vehicles involved in collusion,
              road conditions etc.</p>
              <p>For modern buses which are made up of more fibreglass components
              instead of metal, it helps to reduce capital cost, dead weight of
              the bus and hence greater fuel economy.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Our Habits uses fibreglass panels too, but why can they withstand impacts so much better?</p>
              <p>The trick lies in the structure, not the panels that covers the structure. The framework is what supports and made up of, a bodywork. The fibreglass panels are merely cosmetic parts that cover up the bus, much like the difference between bones and skins.</p>
              <p>Most modern bodywork used aluminium as their structure material. Depending on the aluminium alloy, their strength varies. There are 2xxx, 3xxx, 6xxx, 7xxx etc. series of alloys, all with their unique strength and properties. Pure aluminium is too weak. My school's Engineering workshop ever used a pure aluminium sheet. Its abt 5mm thick. I can dent it by just punching hard with my fist. Aluminium is a SUPER poor impact resistor. It cannot withstand hard impacts. I shan't go further into this, later become too cheem.</p>
              <p>Hispano Habit, however, uses steel (or stainless steel) as their structure materials (according to product pdf. file). Steel is extremely hardy when it comes to resisting impacts. However its main drawback is its weight. Steel has higher yield point (the point where metal fails under constant strain) compared to aluminum. It has a unique bending properties too.</p>
              <p>I still trust a Habit, as its bodywork is tested with accordance to EU safety standards (including rollover tests).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From what I can gather, Comfort DelGro have a disliking for manufacturers who use Selective Catalytic Reduction in their engines in order to meet Euro 4/5/EEV.  In Australia, Comfort DelGro Cabcharge's (CDC) largest operation, Westbus/Hillsbus in Sydney's west is purchasing only Scania buses with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (coincidence perhaps?).  I believe that CDC do not wish to invest in AdBlue refuelling infrastructure, even though a Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE consumes over 10L less diesel per 100km than a Scania K230UB.  While the Mercedes-Benz chassis is more expensive than the Scania chassis and the engines require AdBlue, the ~20% lower diesel consumption equates to significant savings over the lifetime of each vehicle.  In addition, the SCR concept allows for a better performing, cooler running engine, extending engine life and service intervals.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p></div>

              <p>1. Gemilang is ONE of the major coachwork company. But certainly not for most of the express buses shuttling regularly between Singapore and Malaysia. SKSbus-made coaches has more units running than Gemilang.</p>
              <p>2. I would like to see some factual evidence to back up your alleged claims that the citybus bodywork design by Gemilang is less durable than the express coach bodywork design. Please do not quote statements based on your visual assessments or observations, but rather from the technical aspect of the structural design itself.</p>

              <p>even if another habit hit TIB1138M the same way at same speed, the habit will have suffer the same damage as SBS8074K. The back part of the habit is the engine portion.. and any bus travelling at 50km hit suddenly onto another bus will suffer severe damage.

              <p><br>Has it occur to anyone here that the reason for the damage might due to the structure of the low floor chassis that might cause it to "dive" beyond a higher chassis platform, which causes the frontal damage to be more prominent??? This causes the front part of the chassis of a low floor bus to diverge below another chassis which has a higher platform, hence cause more substaintial frontal damage. Moreover a moving object tends to sustain higher damages when hitting a stationary object, because of the impact forces. Think about it.</p>
              <p>Sadly to say this kind of automobile bodywork technology has already existant in modern cars already and is tested and proven. To bus operators, it helps to reduce weight and hence reduce fuel consumption. Drawback is that a more sustaintial damage is inevitable because structure is used for impact forces absorption. Impact absorption is the key to modern automobile bodywork in the modern automobile technology era. Has it ever ocurred to you all that despite the bus having suffered from that degree of damage, the bus captain only suffer a broken leg, instead of being killed at such levels of frontal damage???</p>
              <p>Thus it is not just the 900 KUBs that will have this kind of problem as well, but the 133 OCs as well, as they all use Gemilang bodyworks. There is nothing much we can really do since our local GLC linked bus operators wants to choose Malaysian bodyworks as their bus body builders, in order of gaining higher profitabiliy, rather than the well being of the general public. Rather than just arguing here, wwhy not to give your feedback to SBST and SMRT instead on why they choose Gemilang??? </p>
              <p>If you look at China automobiles, it would be much more worse. Look at the crash tests of China cars, it will really scare many people. But at least the bus has been duly repaired and back on service now instead of being scrapped, after the period of necessary and responsible investigation, instead of sub standard repairing works and back to service without much proper tests for assurance.</p>
