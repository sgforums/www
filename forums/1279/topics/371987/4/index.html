              <p><br>im not forcing my opinions on SBST for that brown.Or K230UBs Euro IV massager. i said i just feel. lol</p>
              <p>let me repeat again, there are different types of passengers, some really expects a comfortable and nice journey while some just think gets to point A to B only.</p>
              <p>Also, why does SBST listens to feedback? because their revenue comes from their customers who are the ones taking the buses. Suggesting something to improve on isn't wrong! i believe unless the suggestion is ridiculous, if not they'd probably take note and implement in the future!</p>
              <p>Quoting an example, people feedback about the TIBS fabric seats. SMRT changes them to the more comfortable purple/red cushioned seats after being complaint/feedback about the issue.</p>

SBST cant satisfy everyone....especially those "so called" bus fans on the designs/EDS/interior etc etc. The buses are for general public use... not for decoration purpose.  Further i think SBST have done their own calculation and have their own reasons to purchase 1100 unit of Scania SDs.</p>

              <p>Interior is not the killer point for me. It's the vibration which rattles my teeth off.</p>
              <p>As for the perception of the general public, <em>none</em> of my friends (i.e. not bus fans) are convinced, even with the new Scanias, that buses are a better mode of transport. They'd rather still stand and try to squeeze on the train all the way.</p>
              <p>I think when some bus fans heard of Scanias on 502, more are going to prefer piling on the train anyway.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Yes, but Soon Chow has a long term partnership with SBS and SBST already, for more than 30 years in precise, so I think Soon Chow is the most likely candidate.</p>
              <p>For those who keep on complaining about SBST buying the KUBs, please think before giving all those senseless posts. Buying bus fleets is not just choosing any brand you fancy and you say you want to buy and how many you want to buy and that's it, buy. I believe SBST would not just want or like to buy Scanias only if they have so many choices to make. They have to take in account of the price per chassis, the operating costs per chassis, the fuel consumption and fuel performance for that particular model, etc. If SBST really had wanted to just buy one brand only, then why is it SBST still bring in so many demonstrators from other brands as well??? Those demonstrators are there for a purpose, evaluation/consideration/more choices, and not just for show.</p>
              <p>It is just too bad or maybe say too coincidence that Scania is able to convince SBST of its performance and other factors like operating and maintanance issues at this era, just like what Volvo did with the B10M in the 1990s and Mercedes Benz did with the OF1413s and OF1417s in the 70s and 80s. </p>
              <p>Think Comfort cabs with Toyota Crown Comforts as well to relate the case.</p>
              <p>IMPO, certainly I hope that SBST will buy some Mercedes Benz and Volvo or other brands of single deckers or even double deckers one day. But the environment now is different from what it is in the 1990s. Chassis were cheaper because there is no mandatory need for WAB and low floor buses, as such kind of buses tend to cost at higher prices. Things become more expensive nowadays, and operators need to maximize standardization to keep operating prices low. Even operators are using more cost effective bus bodies nowadays for new fleets, just like what it was in the 1970s and 1980s where SBS uses Soon Chow for almost all of its bus fleets. It is just that we are lucky that prices were reasonable in the 1990s that we could get to enjoy more of DM and Alexander products for SBS and TIBS buses. No matter how happy or unsatisfied with the new bus fleet being acquired, what the fact is, the operating environment now has changed, and ever since we stepped into the 21st century.</p>
              <p>If there is no mandatory law for acquiring WAB chassis, I believe SBST will have a wider variety of brands and chassis to choose from, since acquiring other types of chassis might be cheaper than a WAB one. Plus they need to consider that the chassis and engine emissions have to be EURO IV at least, which I believe is not cheap too. On a personal note, I believe SBST's urgency to buy the 900 KUBs is because they have to meet the WAB bus criteria with the 2015 deadline and also it's LTA's fault that kicked in this stupid regulation too late. And thus the lag in deregistering of the O405s and N113CRBs. They should have make it mandatory since the early 2000s to allow operators to have more time for preparation.</p>
              <p>For those who think taking buses are getting boring or interior that doesn't suit your fancy and because of less variety of buses, then I suggest you work hard, save up and get your own transport instead. Else live with it. Bus companies doesn't always satisfy such kind of fantasies.</p>
              <p>On the last note, if you think that the current KUB interior is boring or whatever, then feedback to them instead of just complaining here. And feedback to them on more constructive issues on the improvements, such as the number of seats and widening the steps at the back aisle, etc. Just like what those improvements they did from the EURO IV batch to the EURO V EEV batch. I believe the next 200 KUBs can be even better than the EURO V EEV ones, if more feedbacks can be given to them, instead of just complaining and complaining and complaining...</p>
              <p>Lastly stop flamming in this topic.</p>

              <p>the colours and stuffs, just hope they improve it because the brown isn't really nice imo, though i said before in my review, opinions will differ. I'd rather they also use different bodyworks for the upcoming buses because if a design fault is found, not all are affected.</p>

              <p>I miss the days of the earlier bus scene when there are more
              types of bus models plying the roads (about a fleet of 100-300 per
              model); hence more different bus designs, bodyworks and also engine
              sounds. It helps to make travelling by bus less boring.</p>

              <p>So far, Scania's tradition is the usage of ZF transmission. From L113s to K95s, all were using ZF, non were Voith if i remember clearly. N113 were the exceptions. If im not wrong, i read some where that Scania engines were technically "non-compatible" with Voith transmission. Not sure how true that is.</p>
