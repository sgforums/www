              <p>From what I can gather, Comfort DelGro have a disliking for
              manufacturers who use Selective Catalytic Reduction in their
              engines in order to meet Euro 4/5/EEV.  In Australia, Comfort
              DelGro Cabcharge's (CDC) largest operation, Westbus/Hillsbus in
              Sydney's west is purchasing only Scania buses with Exhaust Gas
              Recirculation (coincidence perhaps?).  I believe that CDC do
              not wish to invest in AdBlue refuelling infrastructure, even though
              a Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE consumes over 10L less diesel per 100km
              than a Scania K230UB.  While the Mercedes-Benz chassis is more
              expensive than the Scania chassis and the engines require AdBlue,
              the ~20% lower diesel consumption equates to significant savings
              over the lifetime of each vehicle.  In addition, the SCR
              concept allows for a better performing, cooler running engine,
              extending engine life and service intervals.<br> <br> Regards,<br> Dave</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Apparently, the ADBlue tank uses up space + adds weight, so this may be why Comfort DelGro refuses to buy SCR buses. Or its more likely due to the massive numbers of buses they have, and the problem of acquiring that much AdBlue, and the storage of AdBlue as well. Apparently, if the OCs run out of AdBlue, they downrate themselves to go at a lower power output of around 210PS (just like the CPU in your com when it gets too hot) and to keep themselves in the Euro V emmsions , wasn't it? So it could be a logistics thing, too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, since SBST bought an OC, and Mercedes Benz prefers SCR, wouldn't it be a hassle to procure AdBlue for ONE bus? Or do they put the OC at AM and then go buy AdBlue from SMRT AMDEP? Or does Mercedes Benz offer an EGR version of the OC, albeit with muted engine power?</p>

              <p>Good that you have someone to back you up, although it still didn't answer my question. I'm not going to pursue the question because you will not understand, taking into consideration your knowledge on the matter. However, as you grow older and gain more knowledge on how these structures are built, I hope one day you will understand why I posed you that question. Get in touch with people who are familiar with these things and only then you will know why it is made that way, and how it is made. I'm not being 'defensive' of Gemilang, but each structure is designed to serve its purpose. What's more that the decision makers have taken all factors into consideration, and concluded that it is what's best for them.</p>
              <p>And as for SBS8074K, it's just a picture of the wreckage. There are so many factors that contribute to such a damage. But I won't deny that the bodywork did play a part, and neither that it was the sole contributing factor.</p>

              <p><br>It obviously won't be so terrible as 8074K as how its whole front got torn open and caved in after ramming into just another bus.God knows what it would have become into if it had been rammed by something heavier and stronger or had it rammed into something much more bigger and stronger than it.</p>

              <p>even if another habit hit TIB1138M the same way at same speed, the habit will have suffer the same damage as SBS8074K. The back part of the habit is the engine portion.. and any bus travelling at 50km hit suddenly onto another bus will suffer severe damage. And for SBS8074K, the fire fighters have CUT OUT the front part of the bus to rescue the BC. the actual damage is not that severe. pls go and read through the archive first.</p>
