            <div class='col-md body'>Sick and tired of SMRT buses and trains waiting frequency. Right now their mean waiting time is about 15 minutes across the board.<br>Also have many cases of overcrowding and undercapacity/over capacity on certain routes?<br><br>But we cannot complain unless we have concrete evidence. Thus, What i suggest is this thread be used to note down all proper complains and suggestions regarding SMRT services.<br><br>Wht the complain should comprise of is the date of incident/Registration of bus and the service no. Also if possible the Service captain's name so that SMRT bus can trace the incident.<br><br>What do you guys think..Coz i personally think that SMRT buses is getting from bad to worse and as some1 living in SMRT dominated areas...getting quite Dulan alreadi. I think we need to be proactive and do something.<br><br>I suppose the same thing can be done for SBST services ba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I know. the mean waiting time for buses is around 10 to 15 minutes for<br>TIbs last time alreadi. What I am trying to r aise here is that some services deserve a shorter waiting time and we should try to raise the issue instead of suffering in silence..coz i tried complaining to no avail..If more people complain.then they certainly have to do something about it.</div>

Even if SBST were to run this line, you also will face the same problems lah. From your info, I work at Toh Tuck Ave since 1995. From SBST to SMRTBUS. Still same. Only difference is that more more ppl living in Bukit Batok and more ppl working around my place. More and more buildings coming up next along Toh Tuck Ave.</div>

Though I see it more as an investment more for $$ rather than for the benefits of the commuters. To make announcement, it is better to use the PA system rather than the screen. They are big but not big enough when you are some distance away (say 20 m).</div>
