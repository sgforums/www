I remember Svc 200 was amended at the end of 1993, the last major rationalisation of that period. The same day, 149 &amp; 390 were also axed and 16 was extended to CGA. The years 1992-1993 were marked by frequent rationalisation of bus services that it is easy to et confused. Svc 186 came about at the beginning of 1993 and was extended to St Mikes later that year. I remember taking Svc 5 from Holland V to Bugis and was reminded of the old 189 route when it took Lower Delta Rd and Jln Bt Merah en route to my destination. SBS probably thought 51 was enough to cover the Upp Cross St-Alexandra Rd sector. In addition, when 103 was shortened, 32 helped to cover part og the Margaret Dr-Tiong Bahru Rd sector.</div>
