            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cck_190:</div><div class="quote_body">hmm...apperantly one of the yew tee residents is me....and the problem is getting worse. cck smrt buses is not doing good at managing the frequency.<br><br>I agree with you on letting sbst compete with smrt on 190, but, how can we alert this matter to the general public? by stforums? or by what? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>It is surprising that Yew Tee residents can bear with 1 shuttle service for so many years. If Bukit Batok residents needs 2 trains transfer to go to Orchard, Yew Tee residents may need 3 transfers (2 trains and 1 bus). In factt Yew Tee residents may need at least 2 transfer to many parts of Singapore.<br><br>Talk to your MP, discuss with your grassroot  leaders, I believe you are not the only person frustrates with poor bus services in Yew Tee.<br><br>A little competition between 2 bus companies may synergise and result in better bus services instead.<br><br>Have you seen those empty DDs plying in CityBuzz routes? Don't you think they could be better deploy in other parts of singapore?<br><br>Have you waited for up to 20 minutes for Service 65/64 at Bencoolen, and what you need is just to make a transfer at Dhobby Ghaut, which could be reached in 15 minutes by Service 11.<br><br>Have you waited for 30minutes at Singapore Custom for service 170 to Queens Road Terminal (not Kranji MRT)? Last Friday night I had waited for up to 40 minutes, 4 buses of Service 170 (terminate at Kranji only), 3 buses of Service 160, 2 buses of Service 950, and couple of CW buses had left, and I still left standing at the Singapore Custom. In the end I am force to take Service 170 and alight at Kranji instead.<br><br>It is obvious for SBST, I would rather grab passengers from other bus companies rather than grabbing passengers from my existing routes. Why bother to improve bus frequency for Service 64/65? Why bother to put in more buses for Service 147? Why bother to ply buses from Kranji to Queens Road on a Friday night just to serve the few?<br><br>Bus companies are happy with monopolised routes, and they would probably do little to improve those routes.<br><br>Do you think SBST will implement FF147? Do you think SbSt will implement Fast Forward services that compete with NEL?<br><br>And do you think why SBST implement FF97 and FF174? They are grabbing passengers from SMRT Trains and Buses.<br><br>Given an option I will choose buses over trains. Nowadays sMRT trains are always jammed packed. I sincerely hope SMRT is aware of the deteriorating service they have been providing.<br><br>I sincerely hope that SMRT is aware that the longer train frequency and jam packed is forcing many passengers to travel by  buses. And I sincerely hope that SMRT is aware that we still need more bus services to complement SMRT train services in the western part of Singapore.<br><br>And I sincerely hope that PTC is monitoring the buses services plying in Yew Tee and Sembawang. Just a connection to nearby MRT station is not sufficient.<br><br></div>

There is the MRT as the backbone of the transport system. The bus network is just to fill up gaps in the MRT network where it is faster to take a bus than the MRT (e.g 168, 969, 965, 161)</div>

Other than those previously owned bus services by SBST, TIBS/SMRT has not come out with many new services.<br><br>I did post the same question to TIBS, and was told that it was not true. They had come with SMRT970. Of course I am quick to rebut them that SMRT970 was to compensate the withdrawal of TIBS5 which has caused many unhapiness then.<br><br>Looking at Punggol and Seng Kang, changes in bus routes are more dynamic and new services are still being introduced despite the running of NEL.<br><br>It is not true that the SMRT train is everything, it's true that all parts of Singapore is accessible by SMRT train, however it may not be the quickest and  most comfortable rides. If that's so, why is there still a need for SBST to come out City Buzz, Chinatown rides, Park Rides and Fast Forward?<br><br>Let's don't argue on the viability of these new initiatives. Do you think CCK is more indeed of Chinatown Rides than Clementi? Perhaps SMRT190her can have some branches to serve residents in YT, and perhaps Fast Forward (by SMRT) services for other services plying in CCK.<br><br>However, do you think SMRT is motivated to implement such new initiatives? Why would I implement FF106 or FF77 or FF75? Why would I drawn passengers from my SMRT trains? Will such initiatives generate more revenues?<br><br>The answer is obvious.<br><br>That's explain SMRT introduction of 950.<br><br>Without the SMRT trains or NEL, it is alright to have 2 bus companies to complement each other. Where both bus companies have their own turf to work on.<br><br>However with SMRT trains and NEL, and with SMRT trains covers all parts of Singapore, it is logical that SMRT would provide minimal bus services to complement her train services. And for those staying in the North-West, they are penalised for minimal bus services for their bus operator own the train services as well!<br><br>Why are there still so many bus services in Boon Lay? Despite it's a terminal SMRT train station? Do we still need those SBST bus services (other than Jurong Industrial Bus Services), if SMRT trains can access to all parts of Singapore?<br><br>I pity especially those staying in YT and Sembawang,  as long as SMRT still  the only bus operator in their area, they could only expect minimal bus services. As for those in BB and Woodlands, they may count themselves lucky for SBST had earlier well developed the bus networks in those areas.<br><br>So it will be a hard job for Mr Gan (Mp for Zhenghua) to improve the bus services in BP. Unless bus services is a public social service and unless bus companies are not public listed companies, his chance of getting SMRT to implement more bus services is slim. Perhaps he should try getting SBST to ply new routes into (and not terminating) his estates.<br><br>Likewise for SBST, why he ignore the changes to SBST198 or SBST196, to allow the bus services to ply along Commonwealth Ave and Alexandra (Ikea) instead? Again SBST has little motivation to make that change, she has SBST195 to ply the exclusive route, why would I bother to make change to SBST198 to grab from the same pool of passenger (and worse lose revenues to those passenger who after change need not have to make change to SBST195).<br><br>Unless there is real competition between bus companies, it may not be easy to have better bus services.<br><br></div>

And SBST operting only bus services (SMRTbus as well).<br><br>Alternatively, we could have SMRT giving out her bus services to a third bus company (Comfort?) . While SBST retained his buses and NEL services.<br><br>There is a conflict of interest (shareholders and passengers) for SMRT. SMRT could only provide minimal bus services to complement her train services. Minimal bus services would anger residents in the West. Implement more bus services that grab passengers from her own Train services would only anger SMRT shareholder.<br><br>If PTC really cares about providing better bus services, they should ask SMRT to let go of bus services.<br><br>(who knows sMRT may be more than willing to give up the bus services too, especially with a barrel of oil hits USD57.5)</div>
