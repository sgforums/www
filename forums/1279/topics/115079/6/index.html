I remember Svc 200 was amended at the end of 1993, the last major rationalisation of that period. The same day, 149 &amp; 390 were also axed and 16 was extended to CGA. The years 1992-1993 were marked by frequent rationalisation of bus services that it is easy to et confused. Svc 186 came about at the beginning of 1993 and was extended to St Mikes later that year. I remember taking Svc 5 from Holland V to Bugis and was reminded of the old 189 route when it took Lower Delta Rd and Jln Bt Merah en route to my destination. SBS probably thought 51 was enough to cover the Upp Cross St-Alexandra Rd sector. In addition, when 103 was shortened, 32 helped to cover part og the Margaret Dr-Tiong Bahru Rd sector.</div></blockquote>I can't remember whether it's 1992 or 1993 that service 200 was shortened. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>You forgot service 31.

The Ikea connection is provided by Service 198 along Jln Bt Merah whereby they need to alight at the stop outside the former Bt Merah SAFRA and walk round the corner to get to Ikea.<br><br>Currently the Clementi/Buona Vista and Outram Park (New Bridge Rd) and Raffles Place connection is provided by the MRT. The suggested new routing will not provide a faster alternative to the MRT as it has to serve Holland Rd, Sixth Ave, Dunearn Rd/Bt Timah corridor enroute. Movement between the suggested areas could be made by only 1 transfer which is necessary in the absence of the direct bus link.</div>
