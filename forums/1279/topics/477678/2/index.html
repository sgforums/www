              <p>Most powerful might just mean "most breakdowns" I believe (which will happen in due time), so SMRT should buy as many Superlions as SBST did with Volvo B10BLEs.</p>

Similarly, the 11m DD has advantages in the city area wrt maneuverability and safety as comapred to 12m SDs or even articulated buses. </p></div>

              DDs can be used for such routes (opening this up for further
              debate). <br> <br> 11m B9TL: the 12m B9TL lacks the dwell time advantage of the A24,
              and since it makes less sense to hold up nearly 100 ppl due to a
              fraction of those alighting at major stops, a shorter version of
              the B9TL mititates dwell time problems with 12m DDs whilst
              retaining some capacity advantage over regular 12m SDs (90 as
              compared to 70) for trunk duties. Similarly, the 11m DD has
              advantages in the city area wrt maneuverability and safety as
              comapred to 12m SDs or even articulated buses. </p>

              <p>I like your idea about the A26s. But unlike the A22 (chassis version of intergral body A21) and A24 (chassis version of integral A23), there is no chassis version of the intergral A26 offered, so the integral bus have to be ordered.</p>
              <p>I have suggested this long time ago when SBS997A was still around but I was always told that these type of rigids are too long (SBS997A was 14.5m, 14.7m could be even worser). Recently MAN has came up with the 13.7m A26 (<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Lion's City C)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, which slots in between 12m and 14.7m, which I think that would be perfect, and the third door is justifiable.</span></p>

              <p>Agree, although the MAN LC series differ from the Citaro family of buses in the sense that the LC is a MAN chassis bodied in-house by MAN whilst the Citaro is a proper integral (where the chassis and bodywork are one). Given this key difference, and that GML is appointed MAN's strategic partner in this region (at least SEA), I believe that the A26 chassis can and may be bodied by GML with the LCL-licensed bodywork. <br><br>I did toy with the idea of a 13.7m A26, but the nos of additional seats (as compared to an A22) made the 13.7m a lesser relevant alternative. Some figures: a 13.7m A26 would only afford you 8 more seats than an A22's current seating pax, whilst the 14.7m variant would add another 16-20 more seats. <br><br>Although i will agree with you that the 13.7m A26 is more maneuverable, I would go a further step to reroute these trunk-express routes to take the main avenues than the narrowed-up roads like YA5 (Yis Ave 5) and the maze of roads leading into TPY INT, SK INT etc. Trunk-express buses shouldnt even be doing feeder duties in the towns they transit by, should they?   <br><br>GML MAN's Strategic Partner: picked this up frm somewhere, but the gist is that GML will now body MAN chassis with a LICENSED version of the original LC bodywork for regional customers who specify the LC bodywork for the buses/chassis ordered. <br><br>Oh, and before I forget, the 3rd door is NOT AN OPTION for even the RHD A26 because of engine placement issues that the Citaros and A22s suffer from. EVEN IF you can squeeze 2 exit doors before the drive axle on the A26, it would make little/no sense to have them in such close proximity to each other. </p>
