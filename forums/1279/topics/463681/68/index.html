              <p>shut the fuck up you deficient doofus. nobody is asking for VIP frequencies or treatment! people merely want to get on the bus so that they can go home, is that so hard to ask for? how about you become one of those waiting for NR6s which never ever came and ended up having to take first buses or cabs home?
