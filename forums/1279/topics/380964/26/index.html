              <p>About the Citaro, the bus would give SMRT a good image that they
              CARE for passenger safety and not only cost. See this, SBST bought
              Scanias which were cheap but did gave a few issues to passengers.
              They didn't accept the OC demostrater for the expensive cost. SMRT
              buy OCs because they are good buses, though expensive in cost but
              at least they are buying quality product. You compare the OCs and
              KUBs. You will see the big difference. Also, SMRT took the
              initiative to refurb the DAFs and Scanias which recieved lots of
              complaints over the years. The addition of Citaro will let SBST see
              that sometimes, you have to sacrifice cost for customer
              satisfaction.</p>

              <p>the intention to demonstrate their concern for passenger safety is there, but if bus drivers continue to behave like gangsters on the road, this point is rendered moot. what use is having a bus that is designed for maximum safety when the person operating it does not embrace these notions and continues to drive in a manner that is inappropriate?</p>
              <p>if you look long and hard you will realise that SBST buys buses in large numbers in one shot (eg 150-200). not like SMRT where the maximum order I've seen thus far is 66 in a batch. if i can buy more units of that model A compared to model B for the same amount of money, and model A fits my requirements, why not? don't forget corporate decisions are ruled by the HEAD, not by the HEART. and cost means different things to different organisations so you can't lump them all as one and the same.</p>
              <p>are you sure that the OC500LE demonstrator was rejected by SBST because of cost? justify your comments by showing me proof. </p>
              <p>SMRT refurbished DAFs and L113CRLs only because of complaints, while SBST refurbished their O405s, N113CRBs, Mk IIIs as part of their midlife upgrading project. so who's the more proactive one here?</p>

              <p>Looking at the fleet size of SMRT in comparison to SBST, of cos it makes sense that the maximum order is only 66.</p>
              <p>And SMRT buses are dirtier than the oldest buses in SBST by a mile. That tells a lot. Cleanliness matters more than the "type". In general, mainteinance for SBST is also better than SMRT.</p>
              <p>Also I don't get why SMRT/LTA are dragging their feets over DDs. Is it that difficult?? Please don't cite all the infrastructure, costs etc etc etc. It will never happen if these keep cropping up.</p>

              <p>It's the workers who let the company image down. I may go into a
              rant bout this but i'm telling this from honest opinion and
              observation. Bus drivers on same service not co-operating with each
              other to maintain frequency, resulting in delays.</p>
              <p>For example, if you have 4 buses in a service running at 10 mins
              frequency and 3 of the buses 'run (chiong)' and reach destination
              very early, you can expect the remainder bus which stick to
              schedule to suffer the worst load. There are a few feeders where
              this happens. I once took a bus which broke down and the bus behind
              it refused to pick up the affected passengers. To make matters
              worse, there's lots of space in the bus. I hope SMRT can just
              reprimand these drivers to stick to schedule. </p>
              <p>Also, there are drivers which dun care about time. Take their
              own sweet time to reach destination resulting in bunchup and
              delays. This is what i don't like about some SMRT services.</p>

              does not embrace these notions and continues to drive in a manner
              that is inappropriate?</p>
              <p>if you look long and hard you will realise that SBST buys buses
              in large numbers in one shot (eg 150-200). not like SMRT where the
              maximum order I've seen thus far is 66 in a batch. if i can buy
              more units of that model A compared to model B for the same amount
              of money, and model A fits my requirements, why not? don't forget
              corporate decisions are ruled by the HEAD, not by the HEART. and
              cost means different things to different organisations so you can't
              lump them all as one and the same.</p>
              <p>are you sure that the OC500LE demonstrator was rejected by SBST
              because of cost? justify your comments by showing me
              proof. </p>
              <p>SMRT refurbished DAFs and L113CRLs only because of complaints,
              while SBST refurbished their O405s, N113CRBs, Mk IIIs as part of
              their midlife upgrading project. so who's the more proactive one
              here?</p>

              <p>SBST has more bad press simply because they are so much bigger than SMRT. naturally if your organisation serves a greater catchment area one would expect proportionally more complaints. greater catchment = more passengers served = increased potential for complaints. </p>

              <p>Baby prams are not rejected outright. They have to be folded to board.</p>
              <p>TIBS converted to A/C first. No other major modifications were made except for seat covers. For SBST's OAC buses, the only major modification to their interior were the A/C vents and seat covers.</p>
              <p>When MUP came for SMRT's era, they got the suppliers to produce the same O405/UD interior specifications as TIBS originally had. The UDs and O405s went for the refurb first. You might not notice it because the new installations were the same interior design as the old (norwithstanding the PVC seat covers)</p>
              <p>I think SMRT had already known that their Scania and DAFs don't have that much of a future; ELBOs didn't get refurbished at all, and these buses have now been relegated to suburban routes. It was only for the DAF/Scanias when SMRT decided to make the 
                  refurbishment visible.</p>

              <p>the policies are there for good reason. the main purpose of a wheelchair-accessible bus is to allow access to wheelchair-bound passengers. not babies in prams. this policy has been clearly communicated on their website and IIRC, on promotional material when the B9TLs were launched. drivers have also been instructed to request passengers to fold up baby prams. this is sufficient notice on making their policies known and should absolve them from any further liabilities.</p>
              <p>unfortunately SBST have already taken a re-look at the K230UB as you have suggested and have continually made improvements in response to feedback. </p>
              <p>unfair comparison in what terms? there were a substantial number of air-conditioned buses that were also refurbished (50 N113CRBs + 500 O405s + 300 Mk IIIs = 850 buses), more than the non air-conditioned buses (150 N113CRBs + 200 Mk IIs + 200 O405s = 550 buses). sure, you can say that SBST might as well do it all at one shot, but going by your logic, SBST should not have refurbished the aircon buses then?</p>

              <p>About the Citaro, the bus would give SMRT a good image that they CARE for passenger safety and not only cost. See this, SBST bought Scanias which were cheap but did gave a few issues to passengers. <strong>They didn't accept the OC demostrater for the expensive cost.</strong> SMRT buy OCs because they are good buses, though expensive in cost but at least they are buying quality product. You compare the OCs and KUBs. You will see the big difference. <strong>Also, SMRT took the initiative to refurb the DAFs and Scanias which recieved lots of complaints over the years.</strong> The addition of Citaro will let SBST see that sometimes, you have to sacrifice cost for customer satisfaction.</p>

              mistaken than the MKIIs, along with the MKIIIs.</p>
              <p>The MKIVs were refurbished later, in keeping with the mid-life
              tempo.</p>
              <p>The LOs and VOs were a little later, but I presume that's
              because its harder for DDs, but 9188J was refurbished earlier.</p>
              <p>So SBST is actually more consistent that SMRT IMO just to quote
              these examples. With regards to "mid-life" upgrades.</p>

              <p>Somehow the VO3X (especially Batch 2 and 3) have held up pretty well, most of them still are in not too bad a condition even after close to 14 years of usage.</p>

              <p>SMRT Corp has already admitted their bus operations are a liability, is that not enough substantiation on my part? which organisation would continue to show interest in a division they have dismissed as a "liability", unless forced to by public pressure or external intervention?</p>
