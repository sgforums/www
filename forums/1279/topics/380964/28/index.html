              <p><br> Why bother to argue with these people???</p>
              <p>It is already obvious that they merely support the company just
                      because they buy better buses, not providing better services.
                      Simply shallow minded. And disregrding the "old TIBS" buses in
                      their fleet simply irks me on this company even further. If not for
                      TIBS bus, would SMRTB be what it is today??? "130 strong fleet", so
                      the rest of the 600 odd buses are "trash" and not part of the SMRTB
                      fleet??? Never mind, not commenting any further, or else these <strong>fan
                      boys</strong> will continue their mindless reasonings again.</p>
              <p>And yes, I waited 40 mins for 961 along Woodlands Road last
                      week, evening peak. Really, that's called "good service" to you
                      all.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>from the moment you came into the bus forum, i have yet to see any non-derogative comments from you.</p>
              <p>you has seriously neglected that SMRTB is still a company, a transport operator who still provide a service to the commuters. you don't predict bus fans likes SMRT because of their buses, and SBST because they provide good services. but because both companies are transport operators which should aim at providing services and related services, and for bus fans to like it can be as simple as because of 1 transport operator that only operates buses around their vicinity that as bus fans it plays a part to liking that service or the company since they have grown up taking buses from the service/company.</p>
              <p>at least via complaints does a transport operator become better, and even better if the transport operators takes the initiative even before they receive the complaints. SBST and SMRTB doesn't really take the initiative. before you say about the bad points of SMRT, why not talk about the same thing for SBST? do take note im only using examples to illustrate, and i have no intention to rant on these services nor do i want to use this to judge which is the better transport operator because i find that there's no need to.</p>
              <p>i have ever waited for 45 minutes at the city area for a 162 to come. during peak hours even. it fails terribly to see the bus being jammed packed with passengers and with passengers not being able to board. that's not all, as a near-daily commuter of 162, i have yet to see any visible improvement of its frequency. i can wait up from 10 - 35 minutes for 1 bus till the end of peak hours and with this sort of frequency even during off-peak, its not only because of the jams, but also the neglection.</p>
              <p>how about taking another service as an example? service 132. another service with not much, if not no improvement to its frequency for the past decade that i've been taking it. i have ever waited from 15 - 35 minutes per bus during peak hours. and some of these buses would have been quite full already. during off-peak its frequency can sometimes be very bad also. i have ever waited for much longer than the maximum 16 minutes frequency during off peaks. how to justify this sort of frequency when there's no jams in most part of the roads it goes to during off-peak. even if there is, the jams had been quite minor and 132 can easily go past the jams within a few minutes.</p>
              <p>for SMRTB, i can wait for 985 for 20-30 minutes during peak hours and around 20 minutes even during off-peak hours. 985 can be quite full even during peak hours. at some point of time, its full to the entrance. its the fastest way to get to bukit batok from toa payoh via bus. not to mentioned there may be jams up on the expressway which makes the frequency worse and lesser chance to get up on the bus.</p>
              <p>a few other SMRTB services share the same kind of frequency, like 178, 852, though i waited lesser for these two. around 18-25 minutes for them during peak hours at most. off peak hours is much better at around 15-20 minutes. however for these two services i still have a chance to get up on the bus and sometimes find myself a seat at the same time even during peak hours. also, both services are also jammed quite a bit during peak hours. nonetheless, the few services that i've waited the longest and with the longest frequency comes from SBST.</p>
              <p>the services and buses of SBST and SMRTB has their good and bad points, but im not affected by the bad points but rather the good points? why? they are still the service provider, and we pay for these services. though we have the right not to take their services if some people thinks the services or buses is bad (maybe due to personal preferences for some), we can also complain to the relevant transport operator about the services or buses in query to improve them. we shouldn't condemn the relevant transport operators just because of the quality the provide because the passengers and the company themselves helps to improve them further. i don't. but you, you, along with a few other bus fans here condemn SMRT for such a service they provide. and for most of your (not theirs, theirs is lesser) comments in the bus forum it has been like this.</p>
              <p>and in bold, kindly don't call others fan boys. you may say this because you have not meet any bus fans before. even if you have heard hearsay about the bus fans in general, its not enough for you to call them fan boys. it is very rude, and if you haven't realised it, you are generalising most bus fans as fan boys, when most of us aren't. if you have meet bus fans in bulk before and ever interacted with them before saying that they are fan boys, then i have nothing else to say about this. though there may be more and more younger bus fans joining this hobby, im hoping that you are not generalising us as fan boys because of the age factor, if you are, sorry to say, as an adult, you are disgracing yourself here.</p>
              <p>this is not a rant zone. not for you to rant and rant about others, or
                      to post complains from the complaints you hear from your friend (as
                      what you said last year from your first few posts). you in your first post you made last year have commented others not to judge a bus company by their standards. and yet you are already doing that in your post here, as with most of the replies with similar contents you have posted in other topics. i hope you can reflect on what you are saying now, the comments you said about SMRTB in the other topics with what you have said in your first few posts.</p>

              <p>This merc is really a break through from the mundane K230 and 0C500LE bodywork...good work to SMRT to bring in something new (another is yutong).</p>
              <p>The design is also good.... a flat entry for eldery to go to the back, often the front seats are filled and eldery is being forced to stand</p>

              <p>3-4 Hour if you want to camp there. 2 Hour plus could be a little less.  Yishun &gt; Harbourfront = 1h 30mins(around...If I am not wrong) and Harbourfront &gt; Yishun is also 1h 30mins(if I am not wrong). Plus Traffic, resting, bus stop could add up to 3hours 30mins or more/less.</p>

              <p>One thing for sure, the Citaro is a move for a better accessibility in public transport. Imagine the current LE models like the KUBs and OCs, at most 5 seats available for elderly, while the Citaro opens up all the seats previously inconvenienced by the 2 steps for the elderly and the passengers.</p>
              <p>I hope that this trial be a successful one, and will lead to Citaro Gs/ similar 100% low floor buses be purchased for the benefit of passengers and a growing population. From what i know, SMRT's gonna get feedback @ their webbie at smrt.com.sg/citaro, so do support the accessibility cause rather than the bus.</p>
