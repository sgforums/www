              <p>It's the workers who let the company image down. I may go into a rant bout this but i'm telling this from honest opinion and observation. Bus drivers on same service not co-operating with each other to maintain frequency, resulting in delays.</p>
              <p>For example, if you have 4 buses in a service running at 10 mins frequency and 3 of the buses 'run (chiong)' and reach destination very early, you can expect the remainder bus which stick to schedule to suffer the worst load. There are a few feeders where this happens. I once took a bus which broke down and the bus behind it refused to pick up the affected passengers. To make matters worse, there's lots of space in the bus. I hope SMRT can just reprimand these drivers to stick to schedule.Â </p>
              <p>Also, there are drivers which dun care about time. Take their own sweet time to reach destination resulting in bunchup and delays. This is what i don't like about some SMRT services.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>About the Citaro, the bus would give SMRT a good image that they CARE for passenger safety and not only cost. See this, SBST bought Scanias which were cheap but did gave a few issues to passengers. They didn't accept the OC demostrater for the expensive cost. SMRT buy OCs because they are good buses, though expensive in cost but at least they are buying quality product. You compare the OCs and KUBs. You will see the big difference. Also, SMRT took the initiative to refurb the DAFs and Scanias which recieved lots of complaints over the years. The addition of Citaro will let SBST see that sometimes, you have to sacrifice cost for customer satisfaction.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>That said, however, getting a bus like the Citaro will not fully give SMRT a general good image where operations are concerned. SMRT should look into tightening up their service frequencies and reprimand drivers if they don't follow company rules and commit offences like being too early at the destination point and so on.</p>
