              <p>if its not due to complaints, then why the delay? why wait until
              the bus is 14-15 years old to commence "mid-life" refurbishments.
              if it's not about complaints, doesn't this show a lack of interest
              from the company in doing something? SMRT has already publicly
              admitted that their bus division is a liability - clear sign of
              disinterest there.</p>

              <p>This reply is the precise reason why SMRT decided to give it a makeover. Just because the replacement is not apparent or visible does not mean 
              that broken parts didn't get replaced. Being PR minded, they would have found out that a visible refurbishment has a larger impact on image than if they just retained the original interior specifications as they did for UD/O405s.</p>

              <p>Yes. But visible refurbishment (or lack thereof) has no relation to whether the management is proactive or not. They have performed the replacements, but many have not noticed.</p>
              <p>Your criticisms on giving DAF/Scanias such a late visible refurbishment can also be similarly applied to SBST's O405 Mk I/B10M Mark IIIs in exchange for a few extra years of life. Only we bus fans know that they have received the refurbishments, but to the common traveller seeing that the colours of the interior have hardly changed, they would not have noticed that it was refurbished (which was the case of SMRT's O405/UDs). If they made it visible, SBST passengers would also scream "is it worth it?!"</p>

              <p>SMRT Corp has already admitted their bus operations are a liability, is that not enough substantiation on my part? which organisation would continue to show interest in a division they have dismissed as a "liability", unless forced to by public pressure or external intervention?</p>

              <p><br>You are entitled to your opinions, and I respect that. In fact, I do agree with some of the points you have raised.</p>
              <p>However, the point I'm trying to raise here is cold hard proof. Just like how you want tintinspartan to demonstrate evidence that SBST rejected the OC500LE on the grounds of cost, I would also appreciate it if you can support with factual statistics, your remark that SMRT is refurbishing their buses only on the grounds of public complaints.</p>
              <p>Everyone can come up with as many theories as possible, but until and unless he can show those factual statistics, they remain as they are - theories and opinions. So let's not get carried away debating with opinions as substantiation. It gets nobody anywhere.</p>

              <p>fair enough. the quality of the refurbishment works that have been tendered out ultimately hinges on management decision after all. thus in a way we are able to suss out how proactive or how willing management is in effecting such changes.</p>
              <p>the first round of refurbishments for the Mk IIIs and O405s were definitely noticeable enough IMO. seat cushions were changed and the entire air-con ducting was gutted out and replaced. not to mention standee area was added for the O405s. the second round of refurbishment was minor touchup work not in the same league as that of the L113CRBs and DAFs.</p>

              <p>Yes. But visible refurbishment (or lack thereof) has no relation to whether the management is proactive or not. They have performed the replacements, but many have not noticed.</p>
              <p>Your criticisms on giving DAF/Scanias such a late visible refurbishment can also be similarly applied to SBST's O405 Mk I/B10M Mark IIIs in exchange for a few extra years of life. Only we bus fans know that they have received the refurbishments, but to the common traveller seeing that the colours of the interior have hardly changed, they would not have noticed that it was refurbished (which was the case of SMRT's O405/UDs). If they made it visible, SBST passengers would also scream "is it worth it?!"</p>

              <p>i can see SMRT putting effort now. kudos. last time dusty seats. i remember most buses with dusty seats. cough cough. lances with cockroach colonies, terrible gearslips and vibrations. somehow, i still find their DAF uncomfortable, very dirty, noisy and vibrates alot. but till now their orchard rd habits are still brown. 1209S.</p>
              <p>but at least they got better refurbishment done to their CRLs, i sat 566S on 190 bef refurbishment it was disastrous but i sat a refurbished CRL soon after and it was real good. improvement in their frequency on city area services esp 61 190 700 970. i feel that they really are stepping up this time which is really good.

              <p>It's the workers who let the company image down. I may go into a rant bout this but i'm telling this from honest opinion and observation. Bus drivers on same service not co-operating with each other to maintain frequency, resulting in delays.</p>
              <p>For example, if you have 4 buses in a service running at 10 mins frequency and 3 of the buses 'run (chiong)' and reach destination very early, you can expect the remainder bus which stick to schedule to suffer the worst load. There are a few feeders where this happens. I once took a bus which broke down and the bus behind it refused to pick up the affected passengers. To make matters worse, there's lots of space in the bus. I hope SMRT can just reprimand these drivers to stick to schedule. </p>
              <p>Also, there are drivers which dun care about time. Take their own sweet time to reach destination resulting in bunchup and delays. This is what i don't like about some SMRT services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About the Citaro, the bus would give SMRT a good image that they CARE for passenger safety and not only cost. See this, SBST bought Scanias which were cheap but did gave a few issues to passengers. They didn't accept the OC demostrater for the expensive cost. SMRT buy OCs because they are good buses, though expensive in cost but at least they are buying quality product. You compare the OCs and KUBs. You will see the big difference. Also, SMRT took the initiative to refurb the DAFs and Scanias which recieved lots of complaints over the years. The addition of Citaro will let SBST see that sometimes, you have to sacrifice cost for customer satisfaction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, however, getting a bus like the Citaro will not fully give SMRT a general good image where operations are concerned. SMRT should look into tightening up their service frequencies and reprimand drivers if they don't follow company rules and commit offences like being too early at the destination point and so on.</p>

              <p>If the Merc OCs are expensive, then I reckon a lot of public money has been spent down under in Perth. The Merc OC500s are everywhere, not even a trace of Volvo or Scania. In fact, I thought SG bus fleet owners weren't too fond of Scania because it was expensive to maintain. Why do we only have 1 4th gen Scania (2888)? Why did CRBs make up less than 5% of SBS fleet in 1996 (60% Volvo, 35% Merc, 5% other makes)?</p>
              <p>Why aren't there any Habit-bodied L94UB/UAs in Tibs (now SMRT colours)?</p>
