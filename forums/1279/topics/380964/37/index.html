              <p>Took it just now around 10pm. Taking it at night is even better than daytime, although just now was the first time taking it. The lightings everything was so cool, very stylish and neat. The moment I stepped inside the bus, "WOW".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>Nothing could describe it as it feels more like an A Class coach. Saw the black Entrance door button just below the windscreen wiper hidden in the black coloured portion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> </p>
              <p>The button is in a very good place actually, whereby in case of accident causing infront, once the button is touched, the Entrance doors open immediately for the sake of passengers safety.</p>
              <p>Overall, its smooth, sleek designs, comfortable and very classic indeed.</p>
              <p>Oh, one more thing, on top of the last row of seats, theres actually aircon flowing just above our head. Good job!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Only found 2 cons:</strong></p>
              <p>1) "STOP" sign can mean anything, so passengers may not know its actually <br>"BUS STOPPING", and just now, the sign never lights up a few times. <br><strong>Wire connection problem?</strong></p>
              <p>2) When BC wanted to close the exit doors, the Entrance doors have to be closed first, then open again, in order for all the doors to close. So with this, it wasted abit of the time whenever all doors are open. <strong>Close-open-close!</strong></p>

              <p>Haha, I was actually on the bus just now from HBF Int to Yishun Int. And yes, some passengers complaint having to wait for 30 mins - 1 hr for a 855 bus. Saw the timing cock-up as I was at HBF Int waiting for SMB136C for about 3 hrs, so imagine waiting for every 855 bus for about 45 mins today evening.</p>
              <p>A Dennis Lance even went off service after the previous bus left for 30 to 40 mins, thats why when SMB136C came after the off svc Dennis, people started complaining outside Habourfront Int bus stop.</p>
              <p>Actually all of us in the queue were frustrated, but becos it happen to be the new 100% Low Floor bus, all of us were staring and discussing at it for very long time until the BC came. The only complain started outside becos they <strong>WERE NOT</strong> in the queue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Normally you won't see long queues on 855 like 188 and 963 even during 10pm unlike just now. So, you can imagine never see a 855 bus in interchange for about 30 mins in addition to BC's 10 mins break roughly. In total of about 40 mins of waiting time to onboard 855.</p>

              <p>Erm, the wiper will be the first to be hit, and it's not intended to be activated in that manner, at least not during a head-on collision.</p>

              <p>Not very sure about the timing but this is base on demag_ac spotted at at certain place timing and this timing does not includes the traffic jam(if it happen to have it)</p>
