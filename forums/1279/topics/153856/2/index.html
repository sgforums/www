Those Volvo Mk2, Mk3 Mk4 the standing spaces so small and only can stand one side because of the student big bags. If BC want us to form two rows like that difficult to get off the bus even not two rows also. Students need to move here and there to let others alight and what so ever. It is quite troublesome. The seats too difficult to get off for me, as I carry big and small bags and may accidentally hit on others. If those people carry a lot of barang barang on board those buses it will be difficult for them to put their things and end up may use up the whole seat and others cannot sit. I hope that SBST can use the Nissian Diesel Buses(if can) on the school buses eg Sv 82, 119 and so on as the standing space is quite wide The legroom of the seat also quite ok.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its those back seats where your legs touches the back wheel part, then your knees will look very high up.<br>generally, i find front seats better to seat, eg, those first 2 seats, facing the seats which are facing the back.<br><br>also, widest leg room seats belongs to.. upper deck of VO2x.. quite a suprise.. mk2 WA is super cramp!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like the seats of MKII best, can lean my head n it's not painful...can zzz...<br>next is those of MkIV types, also can lean, but quite painful on the head after a while...SBST seats have good cushion...good for travelling long distances... SMRT seats sux... hard and dirty, try tapping hard on those seats n u can see decades worth of dust jumping out...wonder how much soft drinks, sweat from passengers' arses have seeped into the seats... reeks of smell too...<br><br>i prefer the configuration where all the seats are levelled...like MKs... all the seats are easily accessible in such configuration and standing passengers can grab the seat handles at a comfortable n more stable level... in contrast, for low level seats in front, u haf to grab the seat handles at ur hip level... doesn't provide very good support when the bus flings u hard while braking n accelerating</div>
