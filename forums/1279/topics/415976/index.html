              <p>BUS operators are expected to refund some S$300,000 to commuters who have been overcharged in fares due to errors in measuring distances between bus stops, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced yesterday.</p>
              <p>A nationwide review, conducted from August to October, found that bus commuters travelling between 68 pairs of bus stops have been overcharged since the new distance-based fare system was introduced in July.</p>
              <p>LTA said an estimated 337,000 out of 24.24 million journeys - or 1.4 per cent - are affected every week.</p>
              <p>On average, affected commuters have been overcharged by about $0.04 more per journey for the past five months.</p>
              <p>Affected commuters had between 200m and 1.4km added to their actual travelled distances, with the biggest discrepancy between the bus-stop at Raffles Country Club in Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and the one at Pasir Laba Camp in Jurong for services 182 and 182M.</p>
              <p>The review also found 30 bus-stop pairs, or 0.45 per cent of total bus-stop pairs, which have led to undercharging. Around 104,000 journeys per week are affected, with some commuters being undercharged an average of $0.05 a week - a total of $100,000.</p>
              <p>A total of 149 services run by bus operators SMRT and SBS Transit are affected by the errors. The new distance-based fare system, launched on July 3, has invited controversy since its introduction, with commuters protesting that they had to pay higher fares after its introduction.</p>
              <p>LTA's review was conducted following feedback from commuters, which led to the LTA discovering distance discrepancies in 13 pairs of bus stops in August.</p>
              <p>The errors for these 13 pairs of bus stops have since been corrected, with 180 commuters coming forward with claims.</p>
              <p>The LTA will begin correcting the distances between all 98 bus-stop pairs from tomorrow. Work is expected to be completed by Friday.</p>
              <p>Mr Chew Hock Yong, LTA's chief executive, explained that the distance errors stemmed from mistakes made in measuring the distance between bus stops.</p>
              <p>When the authorities implemented the distance-based fare system, they had used information given out by both bus operators.</p>
              <p>However, the information had not been updated. Operators had not taken into account factors such as road works and bus-route changes, which might have led to some bus stops being moved, he said.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit and SMRT have apologised for the errors.</p>
              <p>"We sincerely apologise to the commuting public for this error and any inconvenience caused," said Mr Chew. v Both operators will not face any penalties this time round, said Mr Chew, noting that they were writing off the fares that were undercharged.</p>
              <p>The Public Transport Council (PTC) will ensure that busstop distances are updated correctly by bus operators every three months or so, he said. A failure to do so would result in fines of up to $100,000 under the PTC Act.</p>
              <p>Commuters can log on to LTA's PublicTransport@SG website today to check if their bus services were among those affected.</p>
