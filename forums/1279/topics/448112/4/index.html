Cause many elderly USE feeder buses to get to the town centre to shop, buy basic daily things, food or visit town council for thingy to ask. Then the Mk4 and 3s have small steps. That also made it delay it's boarding and alighting time. I pity those elderly people. People in Hougang is aging like Ang Mo Kio. Ang Mo Kio got 261, 262, 265, 268, 269. Hougang, 325. 325's Route is [<strong>I forgot how many km!!!]</strong> approximately 12-20km IF I AM NOT WRONG. Elderly people may also want to go to their friend's house to visit them and have chat with them. They will take feeder buses too as feeder buses COVER MOST of the area's place. 325 already cover up 60% of Hougang. If excluding Serangoon , Kovan and Tampines Road area, it will be 70%. The rest is covered up by 113 and 112, which 113 is already WAB and 112 being commonly camoed by K230UBs. So make 325 a WAB sevice like the others :)</p></div>

              <p>Hmmm. I suggest that 82 from Punggol Int GO to NEX and then GO
              to Punggol Road End VIA Punggol Int and back to Punggol Int like
              what AMDEP is doing to 265.<br> I do notice that the frequency of 325 during morning peak hours
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPROVED</span> greatly. It is
              like 2~5 minutes got 1 325 already. You can even see them stacking
              in groups of 2-3 outside Punggol Pri towards Hougang Mall
              direction. I think 325 have 1 missing bus... That plausable slot is
              countinuously filled in by SBS2644E, SBS2703T*, SBS872B, SBS1995Z,
              SBS2665U... Countinuously filled in even when all the MkIII's are
              still in service.<br> [ SBS801G, SBS815S, SBS880C ] [Anyone knows why SBS723Z is dereged
              before it's time? ] The timing of it on off-peak hours improved by
              around 1 - 2 minutes only... if 4 minutes that will be better. But
              I think it is the BCs that drive it very slowly that is causing the
              major problem. Everytime I use iris, they keep saying ''May delay
              due to traffic congestion.'' when 43, 88 and 156 and 101 arent
              affected. First bus : 0-12 minutes, Next bus : 0-36 minutes.<br> The 36 minutes is when SBS723Z is still in service that time. It
              was horrible and many people were crowding at the bus stop. I hate
              it and I was extremely hungry to go Hougang Mall to
              eat. <br> At least, the frequencies improved. Maybe SBS may consider making
              ALL feeder buses to be WAB first. Cause many elderly USE feeder
              buses to get to the town centre to shop, buy basic daily things,
              food or visit town council for thingy to ask. Then the Mk4 and 3s
              have small steps. That also made it delay it's boarding and
              alighting time. I pity those elderly people. People in Hougang is
              aging like Ang Mo Kio. Ang Mo Kio got 261, 262, 265, 268, 269.
              Hougang, 325. 325's Route is [<strong>I forgot how many
              km!!!]</strong> approximately 12-20km IF I AM NOT WRONG. Elderly
              people may also want to go to their friend's house to visit them
              and have chat with them. They will take feeder buses too as feeder
              buses COVER MOST of the area's place. 325 already cover up 60% of
              Hougang. If excluding Serangoon , Kovan and Tampines Road area, it
              will be 70%. The rest is covered up by 113 and 112, which 113 is
              already WAB and 112 being commonly camoed by K230UBs. So make 325 a
              WAB sevice like the others :)</p>

              <p>112 got frequent k230ub cameo? u sure?</p>
              <p>until now dun have even 1 kub cameo hor</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>325 the demand not as large as 113..</p>
              <p>so if 113 nvr get improvements then 325 should not get it too</p>
