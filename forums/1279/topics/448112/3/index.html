              <p>And yes, I dont care if its LO or VO or DT or whatever. 74 needs them. Nothing short of full DD fleet.</p>
              <p>Just stop throwing B10Ms on 74. Its getting very sickening to be unable to board the bus at any given time of the day. </p>
              <p>147 has comparable load. Why does it have a higher DD-SD ratio then 74?? And 165. Nowadays even peak hour also can find sits on SD. Really no need DDs anymore.</p>

              <p>Actually I DO NOT THINK 82 SHOULD BE AMENDED TO PLY PUNGGOL INT.

              TAKE 62. 882 is the only service plying Sembawang End Park. Uncle,
              ppl also live there. If you remove it, people will complain to SMRT
              as other than Taxi and driving your own vehicle, there is no other
              ways of using PUBLIC TRANSPORT to get there. Pity those living
              there. I agree. Withdraw 84 and replace it with 82. I prefer the

              <p>This is because of the opening of the new Serangoon interchange. As there are limited parking slots, both services 81 and 82 were shortlisted and hence made to loop around Serangoon Central instead.</p>
              <p>Also by taking 82 out from Serangoon interchange, there is no more terminating points therefore it got to terminate at Punggol interchange instead. Service 84 was introduced to cover the missing links between Punggol interchange to Punggol Road end.</p>

SBS and SMRT cannot do a thing even if you make a riot. So please, remove that mindset and be a BC to solve the problem. Maybe all buses will become WAB in 2014 if BC problems are solved.

              <p>Even if ALL the WEGs and Citaros on 151 [ 100 buses ] , but you
              have not enough bus drivers. That makes it useless even if you put
              more bus services on that service. Now, SBS is facing lack of bus
              drivers, not lack of buses. Figure it again, thats why there are
              tons of spare buses in depots. If not, there will be lesser than 15
              spare busesif there is sufficient bus drivers. Putting more buses
              does not mean more rides. You need more bus drivers instead. Same
              to all others who are complaining about SBS/SMRT putting more
              freaking buses into the service. Does it help? It only helps to
              decrease the number of buses available to other services. So, stop
              nagging here for 'MORE CITAROS! MORE WRIGHTS!' Isnt a Vo3x enough
              already? <strong style="color: #ff0000;">If you nag again, YOU GO
              BE A BUS CAPTIAN INSTEAD. THAT WILL SOLVE THE LACK OF BUS CAPTAINS.
              SBS AND SMRT NEED A TOTAL OF 3600 BCs. YOU CAN HELP THEM REDUCE THE
              NUMBER TO 3599. </strong><br> Bear with it. The foreigners bus captains are impatient. But they
              helped us to solve the problem of lack of BCs by 1. So, spare SBS
              and SMRT's life by just calling people to become BCs instead of the
              usual "MORE WRIGHTS! MORE CITAROS!" mindset. SBS and SMRT cannot do
              a thing even if you make a riot. So please, remove that mindset and
              be a BC to solve the problem. Maybe all buses will become WAB in
              2014 if BC problems are solved. So, CONTRIBUTE! <br> Btw I am too young to be a BC. XD</p>

              <p>This is because of the opening of the new Serangoon interchange.
              As there are limited parking slots, both services 81 and 82 were
              shortlisted and hence made to loop around Serangoon Central
              instead.</p>
              <p>Also by taking 82 out from Serangoon interchange, there is no
              more terminating points therefore it got to terminate at Punggol
              interchange instead. Service 84 was introduced to cover the missing

              <p>To be more exact, the DDs should be on the shortworking 518A (if it ever happens) instead because it gets people from Pasir Ris to Suntec way faster. And if they do put DDs on 518A, depending on what is the distance covered by the pax, I think it would be something similar to a Premium service, but if i'm not wrong still be cheaper than the current flat fare charged by the Premium services. <br>It would certainly attract a lot of people to use 518A instead of the MRT if they know they are guaranteed of a seat.</p>
