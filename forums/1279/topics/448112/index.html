              <p>Since it's one of the golden opportunity to clean up the new bus mess once and for all, think can start listing out the new inefficiency problems that has begun surfacing</p>
              <p>1) Bus speed: Actually the scheduling system is more or less 'up there', but it's always played by some drivers driving slow or fast. I remembered it took 14 mins for Sv 151 to get from Opp CJC to SAJC during off peak. Apparently it was 151 &amp; 154 road hogging each other. The 2nd 151 bus was abt 3 mins behind, clearly lambat.</p>
              <p>2) Routing: Some routes became played by the MRT politics like Sv 7, 23. Then some like Sv 143, by the time the Toa Payoh bus reaches Jurong East, it's not going to be able to meet with the work going crowd as it's like 8:30am alrdy?</p>
              <p>To me, other than buses to Airport, Boon Lay or corridors w/o MRT, it shouldn't be too long.</p>
              <p>3)  Capacity/ Infrastructure: Some bus stops has to be upgraded. Some has to be overhauled.</p>
              <p>Say the Kranji MRT Stn bus stop, can't the Opp Kranji Stn be upgraded to have proper parking bays for 170X? Of course, 1 issue is how to manage the lorry long queue during evening peak hrs.</p>
              <p>Double decks to incr capacity in face of shortage of manpower?</p>
              <p>4) Traffic: I guess accidents are the main cause of bus delays... More enforcement by TP as like the past w/ frequent patrols?</p>

              <p>Some points to expand,</p>
              <p>2.1 There's some feeder services that generally only have 1 way loading during any time of the day. These services can should attempt to link to 2 different mrt stations if not already done so, to share the load of other services. Such an example is 811 which started plying khatib mrt not too long ago.</p>
              <p>2.2 As per what sbst275 has mentioned, routes should not be so long. What's the point of displaying the destination on the EDS when its not going to bring the passenger there in relatively acceptable time compared to taking a train, say &lt;30% more?</p>
              <p>3.1 Bus stops with more than a certain amount of services plying, should either be extended significantly or staggered as per how the two stops outside ibis hotel at bencoolen street was. This is so that when multiple buses enter the bay, no bus should have the tail sticking out of the bay onto the road.</p>
              <p>3.2 As much as possible, feeder services should try to use stops that are not on the main road, or bus stops that are served by few trunk services. This is so that feeder services does not delay movement of trunk services, as feeders have much looser timetabling.</p>
              <p>4 More enforcement would be good, there's a european country (which i unfortunately forgot) that installs cctv on the front of the vehicle just to capture any cars that violate the bus lanes. The footage is then reviewed by staff, and those who intruded into the bus lane given fines. This could also be done for those inconsiderate drivers who parks in the bus stop.</p>

              <p>Since it's one of the golden opportunity to clean up the new bus
              mess once and for all, think can start listing out the new
              inefficiency problems that has begun surfacing</p>
              <p>1) Bus speed: Actually the scheduling system is more or less 'up
              there', but it's always played by some drivers driving slow or
              fast. I remembered it took 14 mins for Sv 151 to get from Opp CJC
              to SAJC during off peak. Apparently it was 151 &amp; 154 road
              hogging each other. The 2nd 151 bus was abt 3 mins behind, clearly
              lambat.</p>
              <p>2) Routing: Some routes became played by the MRT politics like
              Sv 7, 23. Then some like Sv 143, by the time the Toa Payoh bus
              reaches Jurong East, it's not going to be able to meet with the
              work going crowd as it's like 8:30am alrdy?</p>
              <p>To me, other than buses to Airport, Boon Lay or corridors w/o
              MRT, it shouldn't be too long.</p>
              <p>3)  Capacity/ Infrastructure: Some bus stops has to be
              upgraded. Some has to be overhauled.</p>
              <p>Say the Kranji MRT Stn bus stop, can't the Opp Kranji Stn be
              upgraded to have proper parking bays for 170X? Of course, 1 issue
              is how to manage the lorry long queue during evening peak hrs.</p>
              <p>Double decks to incr capacity in face of shortage of
              manpower?</p>
              <p>4) Traffic: I guess accidents are the main cause of bus
              delays... More enforcement by TP as like the past w/ frequent
              patrols?</p>

              <p>Maybe you should stop complaining about public transport. Since you have mentioned all these, why not withdraw 84,115,191,275,825,882? These buses have 25min freq at least. If u think scheduling buses is easy why not u do it :) </p>
