Nobody implied in any way that you are a "brainless amateur", at the same time nobody is particularly interested in what you want to do with your life with your selected group of close friends too.

              <p>There is nothing wrong to attribute the cause to someone they believe is the cause. It's just that some people are more vocal, while others feel the need to refrain from adding to the excessive anger, even if they feel the same as the people who are vocal.  Maybe your numbers are so small no one could afford to not defend against the barrage of anguish, so you will not understand that winning the argument is everything, but having the right mind to see the larger picture. Or maybe everyone of you all are vocal, so we had so much noises coming from that few people.</p>
              
              <p>For your last paragraph, I don't entertain sweeping statements nor do I need your useless judgment to provide the kind of guidance I need in my life.</p>
