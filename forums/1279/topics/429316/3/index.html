              <p>First, I must say that you are just being racist...and mind you, you are white too. If you say SG is so big and questioned him about snapping at the interchange, let me tell you this...HK is so big but they are snapping at the interchange/terminal..so what you are telling me is that your geography failed badly and you are just like a frog in the well...and please..there isn't any form of gang here.  </p>
              <p>I suggest you scram off from this forum if you are a Singaporean as Singaporean shouldn't be racist :)</p>
