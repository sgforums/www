              <p><br> I am a little surprised because now they even have 79 at 07-08
              minute frequency with almost full fleet DD. Few years back TG

              is it traffic jam problem or bus frequency departing from the interchanges are terrible? sometimes i notice too many buses are going Off Service before the peak period actually end hence end up with terrible frequency on some other bus services.

              <p>Was waiting at jurong east interchange itself. A check on the frequency is 8 to 15 mins from 1700-1900 hrs on weekdays. From 1700hrs is ok. After 6.30pm it gets really crowded at jurong east int. this is when people who knock off at 5plus reach je and the waiting time is 15mins per bus. Guess SBST is thinking that 8mins frequency at 1700hrs onwards the bus would reach CBD around 6plus, just nice for the working crowd. But SBST never consider that 51 is the only bus that has the shotest route to pandan/west coast road from je int.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed... coz to Teban now, you have a bus every 04-05 minutes that too DDs... At JE, they need to combine berth of 79 and 143.. 79 berth is way ahead, so lazy people dont walk further and wait for 143 at JE while 79 normally leaves JE empty and goes all the way empty until Penjuru where it picks up load for Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>These are simple problems that can be resolved by LTA but it does not want to tackle simple ways of doing things.</p>
              <p>51 is a problem with frequency due to its long winding route. 143M should have actually first gone to Pandan and then looped at Teban Gardens, this way providing an alternate service for Pandan to JE MRT. Teban people already have 143/79 at a 04-05 minutes DD frequency.</p>

              <p>There is 78 too. Though it never serve teban directly, but those living near west coast road would take 78. Frequency of 78 is good with almost full DDs too. Actually i would prefer a direct and shorter route from teban/pandan to clementi rather than 143M.</p>

              i find LTA quite stupid to go take over the role of central bus route planning coz they represent the govt and if make the wrong or unpopular decision though it makes economical sense, they will get criticised terribly. but if continue let SBST &amp; SMRT intro/amend/withdraw route is still not so bad coz they represent a private entity only.

              <p>Central planning is needed because without it, there will be less incentive for operators to start new routes as the bus operations of both SBS and SMRT have been loosing money.</p>
              <p>Central Planning and in fact government operated or government tendered bus services are commonplace in the western world, mainly for the purpose of preventing market failure from happening.</p>

              <p>It is not confident. It does not care whether bus has pax or not. It just wants to meet its commitment in terms of numbers. X routes launched, x buses added.. That's about it.. Never analyze the actual usability..</p>

              <p>LTA can choose to cut losses for P Scheme at the end of the two years.</p>
              <p>P Scheme is too quickly conceived...I am more inclined to think that P Scheme is a small-scale experiment of the possible bigger competitive tender system for PTO routes in future.</p>
