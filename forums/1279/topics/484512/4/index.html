              <p>If you haven't noticed, I said the words 'nearly identical'. Without the Teban Gardens loop, 143's route to Pandan Gardens is completely the same as 51's route. As to why 51M is not introduced, I will leave it to you guys and SBS Transit.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBST, i think sbs 143M will benefit more. Purpose is to create direct link for both teban and pandan residents. For current west coast residents, not much issue. That is the problem. When one has it, others will want too. Cannot satisfy everybody.</p>

              <p>Was waiting for 51 at opp ayer rajah cc bus stop just now. Overheard 2 ppl conversation on 143M. Saying it keep looping at teban. They were waiting for 51 also. I check iris and the Next and subsequent is 25mins. A 143 just depart the bus stop not long ago. 143M came minutes later and i decide to board it. No point waiting for 25mins for 1 bus. But the poor 2 fella would rather wait for 51 instead of taking 143M. The point is 143M is there to benefit teban more. As bus analyser had said, teban already have 79/143. There is really no need for 143M. 51M would seriously be better. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBST, they saw the problem with sbs 51 and sbs 143 and they decide to implement sbs 143M to go one loop to teban and to pandan and back to west coast then to teban again and to JE. Surely it will solve most issues but left a minority at pandan who feel it should not go back go to teban to JE. It should directly leave pandan for JE. In this case, for a pandan resident, at best a 8 to 10 min loop at teban. It should at least alleviate the waiting time a little. They cannot expect to appease everybody.</p>

              <p>As a pandan resident myself, i can take 143M and loop or walk out to JTH road. From what i observe during morning rush hours, majority of people will still take 51 or walk out to JTH road. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, initially when they implement sbs 143M, I thought it will be like this. JE -jurong town hall rd -teban gardens-west coast rd -pandan gardens -jurong town hall rd -JE. Just like the old bus service 241 many years ago. However when I read the actual notice, it was pandan gardens back to west coast road and then teban gardens road then jurong town hall road back to JE. I could not think of any other reasons other than to connect pandan gardens and teban gardens by direct link. One more reason will be pandan gardens residents will still have a somewhat faster but albeit roundabout journey to JE. This will still be better than sbs 51. What can we really do? </p>
