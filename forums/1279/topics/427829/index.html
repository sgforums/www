              <p>Is something both companies should look into more.</p>
              <p>Increasingly, I feel the BCs are lacking in situational awareness =&gt; lack of anticipation or too much of it, which is not good also.</p>
              <p>Also, there's increasing incidences of buses taking it for granted that other road-users will give way to it exiting the bus-bay.</p>
              <p>And I had a most horrible ride days ago when this BC was apparently afraid of coming close to the kerb on the left and ended up driving on 2nd lanes most of the way. When he couldn't, he simply slowed to 15km/h and drove like a pussy, waiting for another chance to lane-hog when he could. And no wonder, he couldn't even friggin drive straight!</p>

              <p>Today's BC ended up activating the KUB's ABS because he rolled forward at 15km/h, traffic light turned red, noticed that only 2 seconds later, and then ZHAM brake. The noise of the brake pads going on and off is quite horrific.</p>
              <p>In the end the bus was left with half its body sticking out of the junction. Yet another example of lack of SA and indecisiveness.</p>

              <p>There are 3 kinds of BC: normal BCs, chiong BCs and fearless BCs. </p>
              <p>Normal BCs is your plain old 30ish uncle who drives the regular feeder service.</p>
              <p>Chiong BCs is those who speed a lot.We're talking fast until they stop <em>after</em> the bus stop. Refer below for optional extra information.</p>
              <p>Fearless BCs are chiong BCs plus the devil.Some are just careless or accidental, but some really drive as if they're in F1 cars.Overtake here, cut there, flat out here.... really dangerous driving.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say that they're terrible drivers. In fact they are quite good. It's just that they need to regard safety as their number 1 priority.</p>

              <p>Its an increasing and alarming trend, and the yellow shaded box is encouraging it when it is clearly dangerous and not particularly sensible.</p>
              <p>Anybody who takes bus frequently will concur I believe.</p>
              <p>I believe in giving way to the bus, and I do practice that. But there are increasing number of BCs who take that for granted and assume that everyone drives the way I do.  </p>

              <p>Is something both companies should look into more.</p>
              <p>Increasingly, I feel the BCs are lacking in situational awareness =&gt; lack of anticipation or too much of it, which is not good also.</p>
              <p>Also, there's increasing incidences of buses taking it for granted that other road-users will give way to it exiting the bus-bay.</p>
              <p>And I had a most horrible ride days ago when this BC was apparently afraid of coming close to the kerb on the left and ended up driving on 2nd lanes most of the way. When he couldn't, he simply slowed to 15km/h and drove like a pussy, waiting for another chance to lane-hog when he could. And no wonder, he couldn't even friggin drive straight!</p>

              <p>I take 3 hrs worth of bus rides every weekday. And it need not be the same services.</p>
              <p>How would I not know what I'm talking about?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for SMRT, I don't know much about it. Except the NRs I took occasionally, I heard: Went wrong way, or experienced: zig-zag driving.</p>
              <p>acx&gt; 151 full journey. This was probably the worst case I've had, the guy just puts one hand on the coinbox and any-oh-how cross from lane to lane, but taking care that he does not come within 3m of the kerb. If he did, he simply crawled, <em>but with both hands on steering wheel</em> and then turning left and right gingerly. When he enters bus-bays, he just leaves half the body on the road.</p>

              <p>Of course I would also point out that I trust BCs very much more than cabbies.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Put it this way, that SG car drivers can be selfish: but two wrongs don't make a right. And while I also don't particularly like it when the BC does not assert where necessary, a bus asserting itself is quite alarming at times, <em>especially</em> bendies.</p>
              <p>While the following is of course not likely to be representative of the BC community, we also have BCs who sabo their own kind.</p>
              <p>I've had: BCs who honked and flash light at BCs <em>from the same service</em> because the one in front was driving erratically and super slowly and doing funny things like crawling into the bus bay at walking speed and then stopping short of the bus-stop.</p>
              <p>I've also had: BCs who wanted to filter right, opened the window, asked the BC in front to give way, and the BC refused! And what did my BC do? Race with the other BC, draw in a stale-mate, and then stopped short of the traffic light and blocked the cars behind since he had to make the right turn.</p>
              <p>To paint BCs as angels is not going to cut it. My point is that they do have flaws and one of my gripe is that their SA in general has been deteriorating, or it might simply be that they do not care (which is not likely). Some slow at places where I thought was not necessary, though of course caution is better, but then chose to chiong at other places where I thought was dangerous. At Whitley Rd exit, PIE towards Stevens Rd, BCs usually slow because of the sharp change in gradient. On one fine day, my KUB BC happily went through at 50km/h and the front hit the road with such a force that the front pax either fell off their seats or were thrown off their feet. I myself thought that's the end of the Gemilang body, but it proved otherwise. So there....the KUB body also not so chui after all.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As mentioned about the 151 activating the ABS because he couldn't really decide whether to stop after he missed the red light for 1 second, last night, my 88 BC just chiong through the red light at a cool 60km/h even though he was probably 2 bus-stop lengths away from the traffic light! Granted, that was at AMK Industrial Park 2 at night, so traffic wasn't heavy. But what think you if you were the pax and prepared for a little braking since he was still far, but he chose to carry on through the red light?</p>
