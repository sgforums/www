            <div class='col-md body'>this thread will be a series of sharing some info i been researched on&gt;&gt;<br><br>Bus ticketing equprment<br><br>in the 80s, SBS experimented with then quite famous Almex Autofare 3 system. however they settled with the "cheaper" Sanyo S-Light  for thier OTS schemes.<br><br>the system had many similarities in design to the Almex Autofare 3 systems.  in terms of the push buttons on he console, it look very the same to an Almex Autofare 3 (this one I saw in book) .<br><br>today Almex still makes bus ticketing equipment.<br><br>as for he magenetic farecard era, SBS used Sanyo's S-Light generation 2 equipment.  basically an upgrade off the old machine but abble to handle magnetic farecards.<br><br>ERG systems tied up with Sony to equip us with this EZ-Link system in around 2001. it is of worthy note that  in 1994 3 years prior to 1997 launch of the Hong Kong octopus card system, ERG also develop for Hong Kong their system. also based on the same Sony radio-based signaling technology and equipment that our EZ-Link use.<br><br>ERG today is a very big player in the bus ticketing equipment industry, actively providing expertise in San Francisco and in new South Wales Aust where their readers are the exact same model as ours.<br><br>MALAYSIA<br><br>Incidentally while doing research i found out that Wayfarer and Philips provide some ticketing equipment to Malaysia bus operators with the Phillips haaving the Touch n go for toll paying in Malaysia .<br><br>the Wayfarer machine is of use on some Causseway link buses. it issues thermal tickets. Wayfarer is a company from Uk and always in hot competition with Almex in the 80s in the United Kingdom. today not so sure. hahaah<br><br>Of note some of ex-SBS Sanyo S-Light equipment can be found in some Johore transit buses. And still with he SBS logo on the machines. woooh.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how do they collect fare?<br><br>the Bus conductor<br><br>long gone from Singapore roads, the bus conductor once walked the planks of the old buses of STC n SBS times. but why bus conductor n how does he do his job?<br><br>Why?<br>the need to generate revenue when it comes to running a bus company means u need to collect money from ur customers. this can be done in many ways but things in the United Kingdom settled down to the one man who will do this job. the Bus conductor.<br><br>howw?<br>first a bus conductor will carry many things with him.<br><br>1) waybill: a slip of paper accounting for the amount of money he collects. the Buss cconductor will need to fill in this paper with the numbers on his tickets he issued and count the differences between the numbers for each ticket. the Bus conductor recives his waybill before he starts his job at the start of the day and then hands it in at the depot.<br><br>statisticians will then handle the waybill info to count the revenue out. in the early days ridership also can be found out from the waybills<br><br>2) tickets of different color. for each cash denomination . the tickets will generally have a 4 digit counting number, some fare stages in numbers arranged in square boxes the size of a punch hole.<br><br>3) hole puncher and bell ringer. this piece of equipment is exclusive to then bell punch . they made this bell punch. the conductor uses the punch in this way<br><br>a passenger will tell him the fare he/she is paying. say 50 cents. So he takes out the next 50 cent ticket to pass to passenger. he punches the ticket at where the passenger boards the bus. the punched stub with the fare number falls into a recepticle below the puncher. a bell rings indicating a transaction is complete.<br><br>at the end of the day, all the punched out ticket things 9preferably with the stage number clearly on them) will be sorted out by people n how people travel n travel patterns are determined from these small pieces of paper.<br><br>they also will sort them by colour and then calculate and make sure the amount of money collected tally with the waybill's numbers.<br><br>at th end of the day, the conductor will write down the last ticket number issued for each denomination into the waybill form and calculates he difference.<br><br>4) a bag to hold the money collected.<br><br>so basically this means the conductor has to steady himself on the bus as fares r being collected n he has to know who has paid and who has not paid. not a safe job if the conductor has bad sense of balance on the bus.<br><br>the conductor system was deemed to cubersome,prone to robberies, not safe to walk on bus,  n wage intensive and so bus conductor gave way to OMO. one man operation.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>
