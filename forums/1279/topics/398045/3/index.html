              <p><br>VSOs are loud when moving off and, well, moving in general.</p>
              <p>When they're not moving, they're misleadingly silent.</p>
              <p>KUB's may be noisy but no match for VSO or B9.</p>
              <p>B9 is just plain absurd noisy.</p>

              <p>B10TLs are actually naturally loudest esp first gear and second gear at high rpm with Voith transmission. B9TLs and K230UB are actually soft, its just those older ones with loud radiators.</p>

              <p><br>The B10TLs are usually uniformly loud across all units, including the ZF ones.</p>
              <p>As for the B9TLs, even the new ones produce too much noise for comfort.....some of the 88 fleet roars too much. In fact, my family has even managed to figure out which are the ones that warrant the comment: Oh here comes our fave bus (with sarcasm of cos).</p>
              <p>The VSOs never had so much impact on our lives. It simply integrated pretty fine when it arrived.....but not the B9TLs.</p>
              <p>The B9TL is so bloody loud we could hear it from 2 bus-stops away arriving at our doorstep and we just can't help but roll our eyes especially at dinner-time.</p>
              <p>So....I still refuse to believe when people say other types are louder. They are entitled to their views, sure.....but I still hold to my belief the B9TL is simply the loudest and most irritating.</p>
              <p>The VSO is loud.....but its roar is of a lower pitch than the B9TL which really grates on your ears. The VSO is really tolerable after a while.....for the B9TL, it was the reverse.....only after a while did it start roaring. The worst are the ones where the radiator noise doesnt fade away after a certain speed.....7486L is one. But it still wasnt half as loud as 7350P before it got fixed. My god, it was bloody loud!</p>
              <p>The only other type of noise that's just as irritating to me and comparable is those fuckers who zhng their bike/car to make them sound super cool.</p>
              <p>Yes! The B9TL rank alongside them. That's how loud I think some of them are.</p>

              <p>u are entitled to what you say.</p>
              <p>the very present fact firstly is a B10TL Voith hits higher rpm generatin more noise than a ZF before changing gears, secondly, radiators roar loudly for a longer time generating more noise than a ZF one.</p>
              <p>to the point on B9TLs.</p>
              <p>Well maintained B9TLs arent as loud cos they dun have an extra roar by its radiator at the rear, <strong>while those roaring ones</strong> just go rooooooooooar from the start to the end. <strong>those i agree are way louder than anything we have so far</strong>. the worse parts for those B9TLs are accelerating from zero and initiating the brake.</p>
              <p>if you really are disturbed, video down the B9TLs and other normal buses and send it out to stomp, i notice sbst is rather responsive to stomp articles relating to its operations.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't hate buses since I'm a bus fan. But my general comments on B9TL buses are its vibrations when stationary (some are really terrible) and the noise level. I try to avoid travelling on this model when I'm going for joyrides. I prefer boarding the KUBs than B9TLs. The Leyland and Volvo Olympians (WA) are much better than B9TLs IMO.</div>
