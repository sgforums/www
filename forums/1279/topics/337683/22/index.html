I agreed to a large extent based on your statements. It may take some time to change himself for the better u see, unless he goes back to his old self.. Teaming up with others with good trust is one of the better choice in my opinion. No point arguing over this issue again.

              <p>In a team, sometimes you need to be submissive and sometimes <strong>assertive</strong>...</p>
              <p>Why make people control your life? People don't want to race, then follow them to slack, and make excuses thereafter?</p>
              <p>If want to slack, then either do not come for race, or be frank to organisers and I think will allow you to leave earlier.</p>

              <p><br> But then, I had enough of him, but at most, I do not want my
              reputation to spoil further, he keep losing not only my trust but
              some other ppl trust also.. I agreed to a large extent based on
              your statements. It may take some time to change himself for the
              better u see, unless he goes back to his old self.. Teaming up with
              others with good trust is one of the better choice in my opinion.
              No point arguing over this issue again.</p>

              <p>you don't have to follow what your teammate do. if you had felt uncomfortable with your teammate, you should have told your problem to the organisers. if your teammate is doing what is wrong and shouldn't be done, encourage him not to do it, or just distance yourself from him. there is no need to follow what he's doing when you already know he's doing something which could get your team disqualified. otherwise, you show others that you wanted to talk about this problem, no actions to prevent it, but you are already doing what your teammate is doing, that it could be you yourself disqualifying your team and maybe not him. this is just a view from a contestant of this event.</p>

              <p>I agree with this. and, if u think that ur teammate is a problematic person, then that will teach u a lesson, not to be in the same team as that person the next time the amazing race is up..</p>
