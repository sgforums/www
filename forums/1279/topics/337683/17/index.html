              <p>Anyway, it is all based on your thinking skills. Got one checkpoint that have to take photo of something that is on a piece of paper. There's one where you have to shop for items and show it to the checkpoint master. There's one where you have to give the regos of 40 JB MK-IIIs or else answer deployment question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's one where you have to look around for guides and memerise their service numbers. There is one where you have to copy down bus timings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The final challenge was to find any 4 Station Masters in the crowded Vivocity and ask for their sigs. For the benefit for those who did not get 4 sigs, here are the places where the station masters are spotted.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I came to understand how the race went about yesterday from the Race Crew and here are my comments.</p>
              <p>Most of the participants seriously needs better thinking skills. There are many ways into reading the clue. As long as it does not violate the instructions given in the clue, you can do it. I understand Ben had some creative ideas on the clues and checkpoint tasks, of course with pepper spice and everything nice from the rest of the Race Crew. Good job.</p>
              <p>Thanggam LRT for example. The clue tells you to "Copy down the timings...." Most of you REALLY went to copy down on pen and paper. You waste time travelling from the LRT station to the bus stop and back.. Fortunately the bus stop code was given, if not I think dunno which bus stop you all would find and copy down the timings. One of the teams was smart enough to snap the entire bus stop pole with timings and stuff then write them down on the way back to the checkpoint. Good job.</p>
              <p>Thereafter they tell you to go to Roxy Square. Clue states that you can take the LRT. Please la even if you dont know the Parkway shuttle exists at least know there's an underlying reason why the clue allows you to take the LRT right? Alan's choice of taking 578 was a wise one but failed due to timing coordination. Knew you missed the Parkway shuttle that's why went to attempt 578?</p>
              <p>Picking Sunshine place was a wise clue. There's three places in Singapore with the word Sunshine: One is Sunshine Terr at near Braddell/Bartley Rd junction, two is Sunshine Plaza at Middle Rd, last being the one at CCK.</p>
              <p>I understand some teams do not know how to get from Rumah Tinggi to Vivo the fastest way. Take 63 transfer 145 ah? Wrong! In a race if you take this method you are at risk of falling behind man. Best way is to walk thru the HDB blocks to Alexandra Hospital stop and take any bus to Harbourfront.</p>
              <p>I would recommend taking a systematic direction instead of a runaround race. Going from amdep to Pasir Ris and back to Jln Kayu is a waste of time. Other than that the flow was managable.</p>
              <p>I also recommend scaling down the coverage area to prevent teams from lagging too far behind and had to catch up by skipping the stations. Maybe concentrate in a few HDB towns, or CBD area or even somewhere ulu or something.</p>
              <p>I understand the tasks at the checkpoints were quite challenging and had adequate coverage of some of the basic knowledge a bus enthusiast would need to know. However, one aspect was missed out almost totally. Instead of focusing on checkpoint tasks, the clue from one checkpoint to another should be more focused on the route to getting there. For example, from Pt A to Pt B there are 4 direct routes, 5 routes that require 1 xfer, and 9 routes that require 2 xfers. The clue can state the place of the next checkpoint, and then at the bottom state the route that the team should take e.g. Your route should only consist of 1 transfer only, or Your route should consist of passing by XYA Bldg / plying XTE Rd. This way you can minimise the chances of the team being lost and falling behind.</p>
              <p>Overall, good job though I believe there's lots of room for improvement. Keep it up.</p>

              <p>Anyway, it is all based on your thinking skills. Got one checkpoint that have to take photo of something that is on a piece of paper. There's one where you have to shop for items and show it to the checkpoint master. There's one where you have to give the regos of 40 JB MK-IIIs or else answer deployment question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's one where you have to look around for guides and memerise their service numbers. There is one where you have to copy down bus timings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The final challenge was to find any 4 Station Masters in the crowded Vivocity and ask for their sigs. For the benefit for those who did not get 4 sigs, here are the places where the station masters are spotted.</p>

              <p>1. Uhh, uhh...hahahaha. We missed 578 by 10 seconds. Literally losing hope when we were on 70 and it was shaking its way to Paya Lebar. Also, clues might not be helpful afterall - the planner could have just given the clue as a <strong>distractor</strong>.</p>
              <p>2.  This removes the overtaking factor of the race. The first person will always stay the first, and the last will always stay the last (okay, then maybe the only overtaking factor would be your speed of getting off the bus and to the checkpoint). Everyone would bunch up on the same bus if they're forced to do a certain route just like in the first three checkpoints - considering that our buses don't come every 2 minutes and overtake each other. The last checkpoint at Rumah Tinggi was a bad choice since everyone only had 1 choice of bus to head to the checkpoint unless you walked.</p>
