However, it is true that svc 151 can be quite packed during peak hours, but at other times, it can be quite empty actually, most of the time to be more accurate. also, the frequency of svc 151 had improved a lot, and is much better than svc 852. The fleet had also been upgraded recently to quite a bit of Mk4s, while it still retains the Mk II. Well, tolerate those NACs for  a while more...they are going to be phased out next year, according to LTA's 15-yr regulation. Who knows, by that time there would be plenty of Mk4s running around?<br><br>What a sad topic on the Bt Timah svcs......Im still stuck with Lance 211s that have such a long way to go on svc852<br></div>
