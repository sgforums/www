              <p><br>Majority of the fleet is still TIB-era buses =.= right now, which has a younger fleet compared to SBS. Hence the 200 MAN A22s and extra 40 batch 2 citaros, and probably some TIB-era buses getting moved out for these new buses at the same time, then make it to WAB?<br><br>If they dedicate all the OCs/Citaros back then to certain WAB-certified services only, then end up there might be people complaining why none of the new 0 step easy access new buses serve other routes. lol. When the wheelchair accessible buses are serving on non-WAB, it probably can be considered as a new easy access bus for now for other commuters.</p>

              <p>Yup you are right, the Dennis Lance is just horrible, engine not good, doors are lousy slamming everytime. Aircon is totally not strong and cold at all, esp during hot afternoons the buses can just be like fernance and the aircon ducts are just way too high to reach especially those sitting at the seats located before the backdoor mean the front half of the bus, i just cant even reach to adjust and check if got aircon anot even though my height is like 178cm.. </p>
              <p>Even the UK Lance aircon duct is way up the roof and the engines are not efficient sometimes, slow. Look at the all the Lances, TIB 1010Y for example, kenna so many accidents until the whole bus is disfigured and all are "plastic surgeried" parts and even the back engine cover also become got ventilation holes drilled and back EDS gone. Interior painted to green color instead of its orignial.</p>
              <p>Many lances also gone thru "plastic surgery" as most of you can see thats why they are all so ugly. And lastly, seats are all so cramp more to the back.. Oh man.. I wonder why did TIBS buy lances in the 1st place?</p>

              are not efficient sometimes, slow. Look at the all the Lances, TIB
              1010Y for example, kenna so many accidents until the whole bus is
              disfigured and all are "plastic surgeried" parts and even the back
              engine cover also become got ventilation holes drilled and back EDS
              gone. Interior painted to green color instead of its orignial.</p>
              <p>Many lances also gone thru "plastic surgery" as most of you can
              see thats why they are all so ugly. And lastly, seats are all so
              cramp more to the back.. Oh man.. I wonder why did TIBS buy lances
              in the 1st place?</p>

              <p>Somehow I hope that SMRT can sell off their Lances to other private bus companies in Singapore when all the 200 new MAN A22s arrive by next year.</p>
              <p>Feel that services like 980 should undergo fleet revamp. This service had been sticking to its Lances for a decade liao and furthermore AMDEP always tend to neglect this service when come to upgrading of new bus fleets.</p>
              <p>I still remember 970H was one of the most unique perm that 980 ever had but replaced by those boring Lances when 970H got transferred to WLDEP.</p>
              <p>Whereas look at 852, ever since AMDEP took back 5 duties from WLDEP, the situation improved much better. Now got perm OC500LEs and Citaros. In the past 852 also had a full Lance fleet from AMDEP. If only 980 can also follow 852's footsteps.</p>

              <p>If the UMW Lances are to be sent to Thailand, I wonder if the bus companies there will continue to use the EDS that Tibs installed, or remove them and switch back to plastic destos.</p>

              <p>AMDEP-wise generally I feel that they are more of wanting to make a good impression to the public with their fleets. So I won't be surprised to see citaros hanging on 852,854 etc where they are many people going to school/work.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Majority of Lances accident is case by the powerful acceleration and so SMRT siao2 tighten the pick up and make the bus more worse and not to mention the awful brakes otherwise it's quite a fun bus to drive.The DM bodied Lances just cmi IMHO and SMRT seems cannot do anything with the air suspension thus you notice why many Lances rear body always got visible dent.If the Lances park at open spaces without those rear divider then it's safe.Lances should sent to Kranji and DAF to AMDEP in return.I hope they retain the UK ones at least cause they"re quite new and the Cummins engine is Euro 2 compliance beside the Habit and Volgren bendies</div>

              <p>Lances were not so reliable buses in the first place. Already got 2-3 cases of Lances engine caught fire in their first 2 years of service and was immediately ripped off. Somehow dunno why Tibs bought the Lances in the past.</p>
