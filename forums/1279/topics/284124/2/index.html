            <div class='col-md body'>The purpose of my so called topic is my view on bus bunching problem. I know that this problem has been brought up over and over again similar to some social problems or any environmental problems.<br>I wish to highlight the fact that it will be getting worse if no one does anything about it be it from the transport operator's perspective, or from the government's perpective.<br><br>I apologise if my post seems to be a whining post as perhaps emotions got the better of me when I was writing my posts.<br><br><blockquote>Alamak,Bus brunching also complain,Bus late also complain.What gonna happen to Singaporeans nowadays?I rather have 147 brunching rather than have to wait 35mins per bus.<br></blockquote>In my opinion, it depends on the severity of the problem. Let me give an example, if the freq of 147 is about 6 mins. And only 2 buses bunch using Boon Keng Stn as a landmark, so, the max time I have to wait will be 12 mins. However, if there is an event like for example, Mid Autumn Festival, the problem of bus bunching will worsen and it can get severe up till the point where 6 buses can bunch together and I have to wait for 36 mins.<br><br>If I am rushing for time, I will be annoyed, frustuated, curse and swear and so on and so forth.<br>If I am not, maybe I will wait for 30 mins and that's it, bus hop.<br><br><blockquote>u doubt the effectiveness of it? U imagine the whole fleet of sv147 chiong at a fast speed. lets sae 10 buses speed.. and can u imagine the next time freq is at 60 min? Do u want tat? Or u rather want to have a constant freq in between buses? </blockquote>I don't mean chiong but at least drive at their normal speed.<br><br><blockquote>What do you expect them to do ?<br><br>- Long Route<br>- Heavy Demand<br>- Jams Everywhere<br>- Pax Wants Good Frequency<br><br>With these kinda problem ? Dont blame SBST or what. Question yourself.. Would YOU be able to do a better job if you were the one in control. Seriously, sometimes i really wonder what does Singaporeans wants..<br><br>Like what carbikebus had mentioned..<br>Long Frequency - complaint<br>Bus Bunching - complaint<br><br>What do you guys want the company to do ? </blockquote>I dun think so as of now if I am the one in control to be honest.<br><br>I don't know what Singaporeans want but what I want is just smooth freq of buses.<br><br>There are 3 things that we can do for every problem.<br>1. Recognise it, and do something about it.<br>2. Recognise and continue to whine about it with nothing being done.<br>3. Problem is not even recognised and it continues to fester like some diseases.<br><br>As I have said earlier, my thread here is to highlight the bus bunching problem and the worsening of it. Again, I apologise if my post here seems to be whining, complains or unreasonable.<br><br>I can't solve this problem but at least, I can highlight the severity of this problem to the authorities and it is up to them whether they want to do anything about it.<br><br>I really hope that BCs can get some breaks after driving a bus service especially long ones. They are working very hard and driving a bus alone is certainly not easy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And passengers like u.. Hu love to cramp the bus and making it stuck in bus stop for a long time cus it to bunch up.. Can the government make Bus lanes 24HrS? OR implementing rule to stop passengers from cramping the bus? Or close the door within 15Secs like MRT? If all these is fulfiled, i tink Bus has the same as MRT freq in terms of constant freq..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that bunching is a problem that wont go away so soon. Other than traffic conditions, there are many other factors. For eg, buses in Singapore dont exactly get the 'right of way' on the roads. How many cars drivers actually notice the 'give way to buses' sign at the back. Some of the newer buses now dont even have the sign. As a result, buses have to wait up to a minute to get out of bus bays/slow down to change lanes etc, causing unnecessary delays. I believe this does not happen in Germany.<br><br>On another note, I believe one-off incidents shouldnt be taken as a general condition of the bus service. Delays during Mid-Autumn Festival should be expected. A few years ago, I took 145 at about 8pm on National Day from lavender to TP. 3 buses bunched together and all chionged to TP, let the passengers alight, and immediately left for the next trip again, w/o resting. Most prob, the buses will bunch all the way until Bn Vista. No one will take this as a typical service standard of 145.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes if waiting for a bus that is prone to jam wait like 20min 30min etc shuld give up and go for alternate liao.... like i said moving is better than standing there doing nonthing...<br><br>sometimes instead of squezing up 190 i rather take 700 and transfer lrt home</div>
