Hu love to cramp the bus and making it stuck in bus stop for a long time cus it to bunch up.. Can the government make Bus lanes 24HrS? OR implementing rule to stop passengers from cramping the bus? Or close the door within 15Secs like MRT? If all these is fulfiled, i tink Bus has the same as MRT freq in terms of constant freq..</blockquote>Hmm. One of the reasons why buses are stuck for a bus stop for a very long time is due to the fact that people don't want to move into the rear.<br><br>Pertaining to your question of the government implementing bus lanes 24 hrs, I shall ask you now, "Why not?" Since bus lanes at Orchard Road are 24 hrs now, why not introduce 24 hrs bus lanes on the rest of the road.<br><br>And again, pertaining to your question of the government implementing a rule to stop passengers from cramping the bus, I shall ask you again now, "Why not?" Since this rule has applied to Premium Bus services, why not inroduce to the rest of the bus services.<br><br>Things are not as easy as it seems. Again, my purpose here is to highlight the problem, and I guess that some solutions can be found here, and whether or not, the government or the bus operators wish to do anything pertaining to this problem, it is up to them.<br><br>I agree to the fact that bus bunching is not a problem that is easily solved. In fact, it is linked to ERP, linked to cars, the surging vehicle populations. While COE prices are still falling, for cars and the fact that bus fares are increasing, please don't harbour any high hopes for bus service standards to increase.<br><br>There are numerous ways to solve the problem just that it will seem unpopular on the eyes of the public.<br><br></div>

Problems can be further divided into the extent of the severity of the problem like different stages of a disease. A bus that is late for 2 mins, I don't really consider that as bus bunching. 2 mins only, unless you mind even waiting for 2 mins. I guess you don't get what I mean.<br><br>But anyway off topic from this, today I have another interesting experience from 147. I guess Heaven must be blaming me for creating this topic that's why it is playing a prank on me.<br><br>I was rushing for time for an event at SAFRA Mount Faber. I reached Toho Green bus stop at 0905. 147 came at 0912. I was planning to take 147 (SBS 7334S) to Outram Pk and transfer to 124. While I was on my way to Serangoon, I was contemplating whether or not to take the NEL from Serangoon to OTP. Anyway, I took NEL. Spent around $1 plus on the train while I can choose to take 147 without any extra charges.<br><br>I reach OTP at around 0945. 4 mins after that at 0949, I saw 147 (SBS 7334S) at the bus stop near OTP stn. The speed at which this bus travels is equivalent to the MRT. lol. Must be my retribution for whining too much. I could have saved that $1 plus from the MRT ride if I have made a wise decision.<br><br>Alright, back to the topic, I shall summarise all this in just one sentence.<br><strong>Don't expect basic bus service standards like for eg. freq to increase proportionally with the increase in fares. </strong> Reason: As stated in this topic. And it is just one of the many reasons.<br><br></div>

Traffic along Keppel Rd outside the KTM Stn (eastbound) is always jammed due to the traffic link timing at the Cantonment Link junction. More green time is given for Keppel Rd (west) turning right into Cantonment Link. This cause alot of problem as more vehicles are heading east than west at that point in time. The problem with the traffic light is that the sequence (maybe not the timing) is the same thruout the day!<br><br>1.

            <div class='col-md body'>lol. Since this thread is revived, let me describe one interesting obervation.<br><br>On saturday after noon, I reach the bus stop at 1633. 147 bus came at 1655 with around 85 - 90% full of passengers. The bus travels, picks up passengers along the bus stops that he has visited. After Serangoon Stn where some passengers alight, he starts to zoom past the bus stops onwards even though the passengers were flagging the bus early. I can see the frustuations of the passengers' faces as the bus zooms past them.<br><br>At that point in time, there are still spaces left to accommodate 10 - 13 more passengers onboard.  Anyway, I will like to question whether it is mandatory for the BC to stop at  the bus stop whenever anyone flags the bus at the respective bus stops.</div>
