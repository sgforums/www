            <div class='col-md body'>I guess many of our fellow bus fans or commuters have experienced this common problem while taking the buses in other bus services not only 147.<br><br>I was drinking my drink while waiting for my 147 at Hougang Central to take it to my home in Serangoon North. I took 20 mins or more to finish my drink while I saw 4 74 buses, 2 153 buses, 2 89 buses, 3 27 buses picking up passengers from their respective berths. 147 haven't come at all. So, I walked around with my drink in the interchange and realised that there were no 147 buses resting at the interchange at all. After After drinking for around 16 mins, a bus 147 with bus rego 7313 came back, followed by 9216 5 mins after that.<br><br>7313 came around 5 mins after it was parked in the int. 9216 never parked in the int at all.<br><br><strong>And the most interesting thing is that both buses came its berth at the same time. </strong><br><br>7313, followed by 9216. The BC was grumbling to another BC that they hadn't rested enough and a guy at the office asked them to drive towards Clementi as they were behind schedule.<br><br>I am just wondering whether is that what SBST deals with late arrivals of buses into the interchanges by sending off two buses 7313 and 9216 together on the roads towards Clementi when they were behind schedule.<br><br>It is considered very tough driving service 147.<br>1. Route has 35 stages from Hougang to Clementi.<br>2. Encounters frequent traffic jams along Jalan Besar to Bras Basah Rd<br>3. I have researched 3 yrs ago for 147, it takes around 2 hrs for a bus to travel from Hougang to Clementi. I am not sure how long it takes for now but what I know is that it is definitely longer than 2 hrs due to high number of vehicles on the road now.<br><br>Coming to the topic of bus bunching, it will tend to occur for the following reasons.<br>1. If a bus is behind schedule by x mins, it will have to pick up y more passengers due to the x mins lapse for every bus stops making an assumption that every bus stop generate the same amount of passengers every minute. More time is wasted in picking up passengers and plus if the bus is full, time is wasted in telling people to move into the rear and so on and so forth and the BC will be waiting for the people to squeeze into the bus and to ensure safety before he or she closes the entrance door. Hence, bus bunching occurs.<br><br>2. Traffic conditions.<br><br>What I can suggest is knowing that 147 is a service that often experiences the problem of bus bunching which can be so severe up to a point where I can see at IRIS, waiting time for the next bus to arrive is 28 mins, 4 mins, 2 mins, 4 mins, 2 mins, 2 mins, spare buses should be left at the int so that in case of anything, freq of the service is ensured. Anyway, the mins here represents the distance between each other after a bus passes by a specific bus stop. This is taken during the Mid - Autumn Festival organised at Chinatown on 15th of September 2007.<br><br>Just a thought. And besides, is the thing in bold a common way to so called curb bus bunching problem?<br><br></div>

The down trips may depart on time, but the other buses which are supposed to be in front or behind the down trip bus may not be on schedule, and end up bunching with the down trip bus. This is also a big problem on 179A today, where even the 179A BCs doing the PM peak don't start on time. I've seen 4 buses start 179A at the same time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Of course it will exceed 2 hours if the driver is more than 10min behind schedule.<br><br>The best way to solve the problem highlighted by you is for 9216 to depart as what you said, with 7313 to start a downroute from Bendemeer Rd or Serangoon MRT, depending on how behind schedule is he. The main point is for 7313 to go back to schedule. Of course this would depend on how behind time is this fella. I dont think he will start from Hougang Ave 2 because by the time he reaches there, 9216 would have reached around Monfort Sch, no point.</div>

I am just wondering why do they have to do downtrips for 179A since the route is rather short. It just makes things very complicated be it timings and schedules. And, I agree with you that it also causes the problem of bus bunching.<br><br>Anyway, I have several encounters with 147 having to wait for a very long time. It can be very frustuating especially for someone who is rushing for time.<br>Hence, one of my frens who can take 147 directly to his hse choose to take NEL instead from Paradiz to Serangoon and then walk 15 mins from there to his hse.<br><br>I understand that bus bunching problem is a tough nut to crack plus the fact that bus captain is one of the most shunned jobs in Singapore as reported by The Straits Times some time ago regarding about jobs that most Singaporeans shunned. SBST and SMRT recognises the problem and have been doing their utmost effort to solve the problem. However, given the surging vehicle population (it seems more and more like an excuse), I can say that the problem of bus bunching can get worse in the future. Then, I guess that I will be like the rest of the commuters, whine about the declining bus service standards, having to wait for long hrs just for a bus.<br><br>Anyway, on my way from Ubi to my hse towards AMK direction, I was on 25. It occurred this morning at around 0930. There was a very serious traffic jam stretching from AMK Ave 3 at the junction with Serangoon Nth Ave 1 all the way to AMK Ave 3 at the junction with YCK Rd. It was due to an accident by a bus with another vehicle according to another frenz of mine who resides along the road. In SIngapore, one traffic accident can cause the whole stretch of road to clog up, plus the surging number of vehicles, woot, I can't imagine that. Other roads which are often clogged up are Paya Lebar Rd near Ubi, and also Eunos Link between Bedok Reservoir Rd and PIE. Besides, COE prices for cars are falling.<br><br>I haven't been to Germany before, so I don't know about their road infrastructure. Someone has told me that I should be thankful of Singapore Transport System cos there are other countries which its traffic jams can get so worse such that cars can remain stationary for hours, and hence reduce work productivity.<br><br>My view on public transport.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
