            <div class='col-md body'>I don't feel that SBS lovers should not be unhappy about it. Slow speed does not necessary means cab, but you can take another service if avalible. If not then must be patient, I have been late several times because of slow buses, but contrary to your case, its SMRT which was slow.<br>We must keep our cool when doing discussions, as I am aware many are primary and secondary school students, personally I am only slightly older, but no offence in anything I say too. Internet language is hard to hear, I can understand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sadly, theres no body which you feedback to, and theres visible results.<br><br>the bus companies, or even the government, decides what they want, and not really on what the public really wants.<br><br>take an example of the fare hike. do people have a choice? no. they can only "suffer" in silence and to take what is given to them.<br><br>however, on the other hand, most buses are generally faster than before, and only on rare occasions will u meet slow drivers..<br><br>only thing is the bus frequency was worsen over the years..<br><br>things cant change overnight u know..<br>Rome was'nt build overnight<br><br></div>

Our schedules, however, can only be planned to meet what is usually the expected traffic condition at the various times of the day. There will be times when the traffic conditions are unusually clear or congested and this often results in buses being too early or late.<br><br>When traffic conditions are especially clear, our Bus Captains are required to regulate speed if they notice that they are ahead of schedule. This ensures that the Bus Captains keep the arrival times at the bus stops as close to the planned schedule as possible to avoid any disruption like bus bunching.<br><br>From the perspective of the passengers on board the bus, the journey seems slow but to the passengers waiting at the bus stops along the route, they expect their bus to arrive on time as scheduled. Nonetheless, we will monitor our buses closely and make appropriate adjustments to the running time when necessary.
