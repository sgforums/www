              <p>I beg to differ. God knows what will happen. If it turns out good, great. But if becomes even worse, then its a disaster! Actually its just super slow traffic. They didnt close the entire road.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have been living in Upper Bukit Timah/Hillview area for nearly
              11 years. And this area always is prone to massive and heavy jams.
              And the worst day for it is always Saturday.<br> <br> In 2000, when they first decided to create the underpass/flyover
              from Upper Bukit Timah Road to Clementi Road, I remember how
              vehicles will be stuck in the 2-lane road for a long time! And for
              Jalan Jurong Kechil side, traffic only eased when the road for
              Jalan Jurong Kechil that connects to PIE. And when the
              flyover/underpass was completed in 2004, traffic conditions
              improved.<br> <br> But later on over the years, even before DTL was going under
              construction, traffic on Saturdays at this area can be very
              terrible. A theory by some of my friends is that it is due to the
              shorter traffic light timings. And personally, I feel that, if they
              want people to take the public bus, this shouldn't be the
              way.<br> <br> And now, with DTL, the jams are even visible on weekdays. So
              now...this chaos will get worse before getting better. Only by
              2013, this reign of terror will end!<br> <br> The impact of the jams is that once the roads are jammed, the buses
              all are affected and the frequencies of ALL services are affected.
              That's why so many OS Shift buses were deployed yesterday, such as
              bendy buses on 171 and a Double Deck on 151 and so on.</p>

              <p>All the 174/157 DD took out desto at shell stop. Only one 157 LO was on service. But thats the only DD i ever saw that was on service, the rest all off svc. The KUBs all also off svc. Only a few remain on svc. Practically 90% of the SBST buses that ply that area all went off svc upon reaching that area. Only 170 didnt have this move.</p>
              <p>184 i think is worst hit. Both direction also hit jams. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Jam at the church there(facing PIE entrance). Then loop at clementi come back to shell station, jam again. The funniest is yesterday, 1.20pm depart clementi, 3.10pm reach BP. Worse than i take 67 full trip. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> But i pity the SL, because its his last trip. Upon reaching BP int, he swapped shift with another driver.</p>

              <p>Tis morning I noticed LTA engineers are on site. Think they are mulling adding a traffic crossing for the slip road to Jln Jurong Kechil from Upp Bt Timah Rd.</p>
              <p>As for the bus lane, it cannot be implemented because there's only 2 lanes left. Bus lane must need at least be a 3 lane carriageway.</p>

              <p>Please allow me again to clarify. MacDow do apologise for any inconveniences caused, however we did/do act in accordance with all traffic regulations.</p>
              <p>Jln Jurong Kechil is two lane, with a bus bay, it is not a three lane road until after the UBT junction, it is not a matter of having 'only 2 lanes left', we can only work with what we have to start with. Again once all motorists have seen the new road markings and signage the flow of traffic will return to its normal state. (Which was not great to begin with)</p>
              <p>My/our engineers have been on site all day/night since the diversion works commenced, monitoring traffic, pedestrians, and onlookers. We are proud to say that we have had no pedestrian incidents during these works, and have experienced no traffic incidents; apart from the SMRT bus who lost the right mirror when driver error caused a minor scrape with an unrelated truck - on a section of road that is fully completed. Also we do understand that local traffic congestion effects other services wider reaching.</p>
              <p>MacDow are here to try and help, we are always approachable, and my/our staff are always recognisable with high visibility overalls with the company logo accross the shoulders. We shall continue to demonstrate how serious we are about the safety of all stakeholders, road users, and our site employees.  To this enad we invite all interested parties to come and discuss at any time, or lodge your email address to receive the regular community updates.</p>
              <p>Also, i am very real, and happy to engage the community in open and honest communications.</p>
