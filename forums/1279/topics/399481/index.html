              <p>Hi brothers and sisters. Just came home from bukit timah/jurong kechil area. Today the DTL contractor MCD(Maconnell Dowell) was carrying out major road alteration on the filter lanes and main 2 lanes of Bukit Timah road and Jurong Kechil road as well as the road infront of Beauty World.</p>
              <p>As a result, a massive severe jam developes quickly and soon forms into a chaotic impatient scene. Many buses were stucked for almost 1.5hrs. Minimum is 30mins, no joke. An account from the passenger who asked me what happened when i boarded TIB862L on 184 told me he boarded the bus at 1.20pm at Clementi. When he talked to me it was already 2:45pm, outside Shell Bus stop. So you can imagine how much his patience has been tested.</p>
              <p>157, 66, 52, 174 buses all went off service upon reaching the Shell stop. One by one, most Scania and DDs all went off service. The only SBST service i see that didnt have this is 170. 1 out of 10 bus remains on service.</p>
              <p>3 985 buses also bunched up. 3 184 bunches up. 173, 171 67, 961 etc all affected severely. Maybe that's why TIB1099S was on 171 today. XD Spotted it at BP heading towards town.</p>
              <p>Did any bus fan witness this too? TIB1224Y also experienced it first hand, before i did. I was at the area from 1.15pm onwards.</p>

              <p>I won't call it a misery for us. I welcome all this trouble and headaches for now because in the future when the MRT is done, I wont be getting stucked at Bukit Timah in the daily weekday jams again, which can last up to 20mins. Sure there must be a con for having a more efficient system.</p>
              <p>But i will call it as a misery for the engineers. No night work/construction/road works, because there are sensitive residential areas around. Bukit Timah road is one of the busiest road in singapore, diverting the lanes is bound to be a severe headache, somemore all this diverting works cant be done at night, hence they are only done on weekends where there are no peak hours. However, this results in time-wasting jam for people using the road.</p>
              <p>Just now saw the engineer and foreman kena confronted by traffic police. Quite a sight really</p>

              <p>No warning signs at the entry junction of Jalan Jurong Kechil where cars could have been warned to take the alternative route (by going straight and round Beauty World).</p>
              <p>For the video's instance, it was ridiciulous (and naive for the authorities) to have  tree pruning approved on the right lane and construction on the left lane at the same time leaving only the center one running!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have been living in Upper Bukit Timah/Hillview area for nearly 11 years. And this area always is prone to massive and heavy jams. And the worst day for it is always Saturday.<br><br>In 2000, when they first decided to create the underpass/flyover from Upper Bukit Timah Road to Clementi Road, I remember how vehicles will be stuck in the 2-lane road for a long time! And for Jalan Jurong Kechil side, traffic only eased when the road for Jalan Jurong Kechil that connects to PIE. And when the flyover/underpass was completed in 2004, traffic conditions improved.<br><br>But later on over the years, even before DTL was going under construction, traffic on Saturdays at this area can be very terrible. A theory by some of my friends is that it is due to the shorter traffic light timings. And personally, I feel that, if they want people to take the public bus, this shouldn't be the way.<br><br>And now, with DTL, the jams are even visible on weekdays. So now...this chaos will get worse before getting better. Only by 2013, this reign of terror will end!<br><br>The impact of the jams is that once the roads are jammed, the buses all are affected and the frequencies of ALL services are affected. That's why so many OS Shift buses were deployed yesterday, such as bendy buses on 171 and a Double Deck on 151 and so on.</p></div>
