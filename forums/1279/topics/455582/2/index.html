              <p>I see that SMRT always want to try to be different all the time instead of being practical and down the earth.</p>
              <p>Then why not in future, just buy MIC buses, like Yutong, Zhongtong, Higer, Sunlong, Kinglong, etc to replace the old fleets in future? Or just go back to the basics, go for Japanese like Hino and Nissans?</p>
