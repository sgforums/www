              <p>Under SMRT Corp, there are many wholly-owned subsidiary companies managing their respective core competencies</p>
              <p>SMRT Buses Ltd takes care of bus operation</p>
              <p>SMRT Trains Ltd takes care of rail operation</p>
              <p>SMRT Light Rail takes care of Bt Panjang LRT</p>
              <p>SMRT Taxis takes care of taxis</p>
              <p>SMRT Automotives takes care of bus and taxi repair and maintenance</p>
              <p>SMRT Engineering takes care of rail repair and maintenance</p>
              <p>The same goes for ComfortDelgro</p>
              <p>So the underperformance in bus operation has got nothing to do with the train aspects.</p>
              <p>Be it train or bus, a duopoly is always healthier as it's in line with the objective of market liberalization. Government does not want any single player to monopolize the bus or train market.</p>
              <p>The concept of duopoly was introduced in 1983 when Singapore Bus Service was the sole bus operator. Primarily, the objective is to introduce another player to compete with SBS.</p>
              <p>The very same principle applies when government wanted Singapore Bus Service to rebrand itself as a multi-modal public operator SBS Transit to manage NEL in 2003</p>
              <p>The basis is to create a market consisting of two multi-modal operators</p>

              <p>Totally agree with this point. But, only time will tell with a miracle if it will be true.. Kinda sad to see many of the O405s with dress rims being removed, exposing the other colours of the wheels... <br><br>And, if only the perm-bus system was brought back, I can tell you, many things about the current TIB and SMB buses would be better. No, I dont want to use the term SMRT Buses, it's evil. I rather just call the buses TIB and SMB.. SMRT is evil, and had evil leadership. The operations department and the HR department ought to get fired and replaced with more experienced staff...</p>

              <p>SMRT should have given up long back. From the first day here, I have already emphasize how badly they are managing their bus services. SMRT multi-modal system is a complete failure. Rail screwed up with tons of problems after years of poor maintainace and upgrade of systems. Bus screwed up with poor bus services, poorly maintained bus fleets and keeps on making losses. Cab screwed up as well, with many poor services aspects and making losses.</p>
              <p>No point being multi-modal where non of the operations are successful. Given their heck care attitude, being arrogant, irresponsible and stingy to commuters and not its shareholders, SMRT has already lose its purpose in Singapore. Better of that Hong Kong MTR to take over SMRT rail business, SBST or Hong Kong KMB to take over their bus operations and TransCab to take over its cab business. But now since they had thought of giving up the bus business, then might as well do so. Lower your losses and divert the money to improve on its core rail business.</p>
              <p>Just do every Singaporean a service here and the last service for Singapore buses, give up your bus operations to others. We have enough of all your nonsensical and irresponsible way and attitude of dealing with bus services for so many years.</p>
              <p>If SMRT really wants to run bus services, then go run cross boarder services like CW services, shuttle services and private buses. Don't run public bus services because SMRT is not qualified. They are better off with just rails mainly.</p>
