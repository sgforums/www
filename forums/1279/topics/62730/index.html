            <div class='col-md body'>i was thinking if TIBS 966, which plies between Woodlands Regional Int and Marine Parade Rd, can turn in into Toa Payoh Lor 6 when it reaches Jalan Toa Payoh in both directions, like what SBST Express 506 does. this will add only less than 5 mins of travel time but can be squeezed into the current schedule since they actually travel faster than the schedule (see below). and i've seen how TIBS allow long-distance services to speed on expressways - my experience came fromTIBS 858 (i saw 120km/h on Mercedes O405 w/o speed limiter before at midnight on its way back to Woodlands Reg Int - they used to put those few buses w/o speed limiters on 858 ). ideal travel time is within 45 mins from Woodlands Reg Int to Marine Parade, and less than 20 mins from Toa Payoh to Marine Parade. this allows TIBS 969 to compete with SBST 31 instead of making passengers walk out to Jalan Toa Payoh from Toa Payoh Int. but i wonder if it is because SBST rejected TIBS' idea at the PTC stage 'cause they wan to protect their Toa Payoh 'turf'?<br><br>FYI<br>this is the schedule sheet that i saw on the driver's seat. from what i can remember,<br>[weekday afternoon]<br>Location (Time from Woodlands Regional Interchange)<br>Woodlands Regional Interchange (0)<br>Marsiling MRT (9)<br>Catholic JC (29)<br>St. Andrew's Sch (37)<br>Eunos MRT (48 )<br>Parkway Parade (57)<br>NOTES:<br>it is scheduled to get to the opposite bus stop in 1-2 mins. break at Woodlands Reg Int is around 13 mins, not including meal breaks, which indicates only one bus is in the interchange bus park. counting travel time, there should be around 11 buses for the TIBS 966 bus fleet (based on average 13min interval), though some had counted 15.<br>the driver left Woodlands Regional Interchange late by 4 mins but was still ahead of schedule. by St. Andrew's Sch, it had been too fast by 10 mins. i suppose the drivers actually reach Marine Parade Rd faster and take longer breaks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It will cause some duplication if those TIBS services (966,985) if they turn into TPY lor 6. But I can see that there is a lack of TIBS svc in Tpy. I would also like to extend it to TPY too.</div>
