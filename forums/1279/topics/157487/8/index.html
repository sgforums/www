This is Singapore.  As the saying goes, In Rome do what the Romans do.  In Singapore, do what the Singaporeans do.  Please speak Singaporean lingo.<br><br>And do you even know the meaning of franchise?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>regarding the 20 hour thing, 20 hours as mentioned on sv3 etc may be seemed as hours of the service running. EG. from 1st bus from Interchange to Last bus reaching its final end point (ie. usually interchange)<br><br>however, its 18~19 hours as seen from 1st/last bus timings seems to suggest there will only be buses running from the interchange from 0535 to 0035. <strong>However, no bus stop will experience 20 hours of continious same service, only 19 hours.</strong><br><br>and yeah, to SGEMP, do please stop confusing people about HK "jargon". This is Singapore..</div>
