LUCKY DRAW<br><br>1.1 Qualifying Periods, Draw Dates and Last Date for Prize Claim<br><br>a) The promotion period for the Lucky Draw is from 4:00am, 12 Nov 2005 to 11:59pm, 2 Jan 2006.<br><br>b) The Lucky Draw will be held on 9 Jan 2006 and the results published in a selected newspaper and the SBST website at a later date.<br><br>c) The last day for the collection of prizes is 1 Mar 2006 by 12:00 noon.<br><br>1.2 Eligibility for Lucky Draw<br><br>a) All ez-link trips made on SBST buses and SBST trains (NEL, SKLRT and PGLRT), with fares deducted from Adult ez-link cards, Senior Citizen ez-link cards, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Student ez-link cards or NSF ez-link cards during the qualifying period as stated in 1.1a are eligible for entry for the Lucky Draw. Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Student ez-link cards or NSF ez-link cards with e-stamps are also eligible for entry for the Lucky Draw. Customers using shareholder or employee passes will not be entitled to participate in this promotion.<br><br>b) The promotion would be administered through the issue of Â“Transit DollarsÂ” to customers equivalent in value to the fares deducted from ez-link cards and Â“Transit TokensÂ” for e-stamp rides during the promotion period.<br><br>c) Â“Transit DollarsÂ” and Â“Transit TokensÂ” are issued by SBST at SBSTÂ’s discretion for the purposes of the Lucky Draw and Online Auction. They do not have any monetary value and can only be used for the Lucky Draw and Online Auction as stipulated by SBST.<br><br>d) The eligible trips shall be allocated 1 chance for each Transit Dollar and 1 chance for every 2 Transit Tokens remaining at the end of the promotion period. For example, an ez-link card with $50.61 Transit Dollars at the end of the promotion on 2 Jan 2006 will have 50 chances of winning. Hence, the more a customer travels on SBST, the better the chances of winning.<br><br>e) The Transit Dollars or Transit Tokens accumulated on one ez-link card shall not be transferable to another ez-link card.<br><br>1.3 Issue of Transit Dollars and Transit Tokens<br><br>a) Â“Transit DollarsÂ” are automatically issued upon complete entry and exit processing at the Entrance and Exit readers and fare gates according to the deducted value of the fare received by SBST (i.e. fare net of transfer rebate and fare apportioned to NEL). For example, $0.39 Â“Transit DollarsÂ” would be issued for a deduction of $0.64 less transfer rebate of $0.25 from the ez-link card on a SBST bus. Users of concession e-stamps will not be issued Â“Transit DollarsÂ” but are issued 1 Â“Transit TokenÂ” for each complete trip instead.<br><br>b) For an MRT trip from Orchard to Little India, only the portion taken on NEL, which is from Dhoby Ghaut to Little India, will earn Transit Dollars. Users of rail concession e-stamps for such a trip will earn 1 Â“Transit TokenÂ”.<br><br>c) On services listed in Annex A, bonus Â“Transit DollarsÂ” and Â“Transit TokensÂ” will be issued. The total Â“Transit DollarsÂ” and Â“Transit TokensÂ” to be issued in this case will be equal to twice that of other SBST services. For example, $0.78 Â“Transit DollarsÂ” will be issued for a deduction of $0.39 from the ez-link card on service 174, which is listed in Annex A. Users of concession e-stamps will not be issued any bonus Â“Transit DollarsÂ” but are issued 2 Â“Transit TokensÂ” for each trip instead.<br><br>1.4 Checking Transit Dollars and Transit Tokens and Registration of ez-link Cardholder<br><br>a) The number of Â“Transit DollarsÂ” and Â“Transit TokensÂ” issued can be checked at the SBST website www.sbstransit.com.sg starting from 19 Nov 2005.<br><br>b) Transit Dollars and Transit Tokens displayed will have a time lag of 5 days. For example, Transit Dollars shown on 30 Nov 2005 are for accumulated Transit Dollars from 12 Nov to 25 Nov 2005.<br><br>c) Registration is not necessary for customers to take part in the lucky draw. However, customers must first register their personal particulars in order to check the Â“Transit DollarsÂ” and Â“Transit TokensÂ” accumulated during the promotional period. Instructions will be available at the SBST website www.sbstransit.com.sg.<br><br>d) The details to be provided for registration are as follows:<br><br>i. ID number of the ez-link card to be registered*<br>ii. Name as in NRIC / Passport*<br>iii. NRIC / Passport No.*<br>iv. E-mail address**<br>v. Home address**<br>vi. Contact number**<br>vii.

Each complete Transit Dollar is equivalent to one chance for the Lucky Draw. Two Transit Tokens are equivalent to one chance for the Lucky Draw. The higher the Transit Dollars or Transit Tokens accumulated, the higher the chances of winning a prize. SBST's decision on the winners of the draw shall be final and conclusive.<br><br>c) SBST reserves the right to draw reserve "winners" in the event that any winner should be subsequently disqualified for any reason.<br><br>1.6 Lucky Draw Prizes<br><br>a) Prizes would be as follows:<br>Prize 	No.<br>$10,000 Cash 	1<br>20 inch LCD TV LCT-20KXST(AV) 	1<br>Digital Camera XPRO S(TI) 	1<br>MP3 Player 512MB MP-OL200 	2<br>MP3 Player 512MB MP-E5 	2<br>DVD Player DVD-2105 	4<br>VCD Radio Cassette Recorder RC-5200V 	3<br>CD Player CR-C10 	2<br>CD Player PCD-X10 	2<br>Total 	18<br><br>b) SBST may at its sole discretion at any time replace or substitute any prize with another prize.<br><br>1.7 Publication of Lucky Draw Results<br><br>a) The results of the draw will be published on the SBST website www.sbstransit.com.sg, and displayed at SBST's bus interchanges, NEL stations, SKLRT and PGLRT stations.
