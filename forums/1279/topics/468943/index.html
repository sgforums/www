              <p>Where did the money go ?</p>
              <p>The MRT store is still open.</p>
              <p>The only observation I made was during the last quarter the advertising panel is missing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the local company being useless when faced with some competition, the only tactics is to force the consumer to pay more for their incompetence.</p>
              <p>Have their standard improved or maintenance improved ?</p>
              <p>Especially the big red company.</p>
              <p>Have they provided more value before they overcharge the consumer for the same content ??</p>
              <p>Just like the same group of people who keep reminding us not to rely on them anymore but why should we bother to pay them millions if they are basically useless in providing any solution ???</p>

              Eh.. do you understand what happened after distance fare was implemented? Does not mean more people means more consumption..
              
              That's why how come w/ so many shopping mall, more biz cashflow problem creep up.. instead of having more biz for everyone...
              
              and also, even bus co in HK are against competition one for one... Bus vs Mini bus is another issue... Simply because there'll be no scale...
              
              Ppl who never do business or this kind will never understand why scale is so impt... Much as ppl talk abt competition..

              <p>Time to sell the bus and taxi division of the company. May be that will be better. I think SBST will face the same problem soon if they start to run the DTLs.</p>
              <p>I think the SMRT bus and taxi division should go to local a new PTE company JV not to SBST or other GLCs. Maybe woodsland transport and other pte company like transcab or other local transport companies that can bid for the taking over. </p>
              <p>SMRT should run only trian services and train stations in singapore it should also take over SBST NE line trian service. Even the DTLs LTA should let SMRT run.</p>

              obviously someone didn't bother to figure out the DTL framework... 
              
              it may seem to cost more to operator.. but it's sort of more stable and there's a clear defined line over maintenance matter...

              <p>I find most heartache at the fact that my fellow singkies just missed the point that <span style="color: #ff0000;">local public transport</span> (with the exception of the mature train lines) were never terribly profitable to start with.</p>
              <p>For those who keep chest-banging and loudly proclaiming SMRT IS PROFITABLE, I suggest you should read the annual reports and revenue flows to understand where these money have been coming from.</p>
              <p>Even CDG doesn't make much money from taxi, bus, train, LRT.</p>
              <p>Cynism doesn't make one look smart. Quite the contrary in fact, and I will not apologise for this caustic view of mine.</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p>Still no excuse. </p>
              <p>How come CDG can break even with 3000 buses with bulk purchases in recent years (really bulk purchase), but SMRT's 800-strong fleet can still come up with a staggering $30M loss? </p>
              <p>If we look at the MAN purchases, it represents only a comparative 1/4 of the fleet. SBST has been far more aggressive in replacing ageing assets and still manages to break even on the whole.</p>
              <p>Revenue figures in fact suggest that <span style="color: #ff0000;">SMRT earns more money on per-bus basis</span> than SBST so catchment isn't the issue as suggested many times! Its the cost....reading the annual reports will show this fact.</p>
              <p>The biggest problem with SMRT is its inexplicable inability to look far ahead. And Desmond Kwek looks like all talk and little movement else.</p>
              <p>About SMRT facing a "unsustainable future"? RUBBISH. We have a dual-operator situation precisely to set bench-marks against both operators as they "compete". It is clear which one is the laggard. Replace the tracks one time only = unsustainable?? Especially since the NSEWL have been raking in so much profits all these while? Where did these profits go???<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Now is the chance to try to correct the mistakesmade by SMRT and TIBS and today's SMRT will do well not to squander this chance lest LTA gets fed up and push it aside. Think not that the govt is not above doing shock measures when it has been embarassed enough.</p>
