            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise in advance for my poor English.<br><br><strong>How long does SMRT want us to wait ?</strong><br><br>Fu Li Yun<br><br>Let's begin with the reason for writing in.<br><br>I am a Bukit Panjang ( BPJ ) resident. On March 15, my fellow BPJ resident Mr Lin had wrote a letter to ZB interaction section, reviewing the incovienience of public transport in BPJ, in which, the focus is on providing direct bus services by the authorities, for instance, direct bus from BPJ to Ang Mo Kio or Toa Payoh.<br><br>11 days later ( March 26 ), SMRT Corporation Public Relations officer, Madam Cai gave a reply. She did not mention a word on direct bus, neither did she pay attention on Mr Lin's request, instead, Mdm Cai reply by teaching the residents of BPJ on how to take bus. Hence, I decided to write to ZB interaction ( published on April 4 ). Requesting SMRT to focus the transport problems in BPJ.<br><br>Besides asking upon how to improve the transport system here, allow the residents to enjoy world class transportation. I would also like to ask SMRT when are they going to introduce direct bus services?<br><br>The last sentence of the reply said, "True heartedly looking forward on a true hearted reply", even a sentence saying "never ever consider before" or "in consideration", is also a reply.<br><br>I believe that I am very patient. For the past month, I have been flipping the pages, with my friend from BPJ, looking for SMRT's reply, but to no avail.<br><br>From the beginning, I thought that SMRT refuse to reply, simply because they need time to translate my letter, or sending personnel to survey the situation. Now, besides feeling doubtful on SMRT's capabilities, the public also seen the bad attitude of SMRT towards passengers.<br><br>Let's make a comparison, on April 15, a well-known person of the local advertisement industry, made a complain of SIA's poor services in ZB's interaction section, received a quick response from SIA. That's a fantastic impression on SIA's responsiveness and professionalism.<br><br>Some people joked that, the difference of attitude towards passengers of these two transport corporation, depends on the mode of transport that they are providing.<br><br>Simply because, one company is providing air services, when the passengers are unsatisfied, they can choose another company. The other company is providing bus and train services, when the passengers are unsatisfied, they still have to wait!</div>
