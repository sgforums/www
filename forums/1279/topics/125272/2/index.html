A transfer betweeen NEL and EWL/NSL is treated as travelling on one mode of public transport, so passengers pay once, but a transfer between NSL and BPLRT, NEL and SKLRT/PGLRT is treated as travelling on two modes of public transport, so passengers pay twice with rebate.<br><br>Why the Boon Lay extension is proposed as an MRT extension instead of a new LRT line, is because after Jurong West St 63, it runs to an industrial area. Having a LRT line running to an industrial area is not a viable option.</div>
