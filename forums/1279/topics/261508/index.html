            <div class='col-md body'>I'm doing a survey here and want some shoutouts from you. Did you ever come across some stubborn or selfish teens that always blast their handphone music in buses, trains or even anywhere outdoors?<br><br>To me, it's very irritating to my ears just to listen to music that I don't like(dance/disco music) and this weird teens blasting their dance hits or sexy music in MRTs. Always never care of other people. I call them 'musical morons that just like to show off'. I apprieciate my music by having headphones on. If I don't have one, I just don't listen to music and keep quiet. These teens sometimes blast up their music till the whole HDB estate hear the 'disgusting' music'. Some apeks would scold them and advise them to keep their volume down.<br><br>There's one incident where these two rude teens blast their music inside a Mercedes 0405G Volgren (TIB1188T). The first 'musical moron' blasts up his music to be louder than the other. Then, the 'other musical moron' would blast his music more louder. Thus, begins a 'handphone blasting' competition. The BC (Bus Captain) can't concentrate on his driving and attention on the roads and stops the bus at the nearest bus stop, just to hear the rest of the students inside the bus to stop them from blasting their handphones. The BC come and report them to their individual schools and had their punishment served.<br><br>Please feel free to leave your complains and comments here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

These people are so selfish.
