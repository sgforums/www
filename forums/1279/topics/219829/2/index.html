            <div class='col-md body'>I felt that the Express services should have concession for students and elderly, just like the Chinatown Express ($1). With the extension of 506, more schools will be served, but students are likely to avoid 506 due to the high fares. Maybe SBST can introduce normal fare between UEC and Bedok Res Rd. Any passengers alighting after that will have pay Express fares. (I'm sure this is feasible with the Ez-link technology.)<br><br>There used to be Express 503 from Tampines to Shenton Way. It linked Tampines, Bedok Reservoir and Marine Parade together and serve many schools (e.g. St Hilda, Damai, TJC, VJC, St Patrick, CHIJ, etc). Although it provided a direct link between my home in Bedok North and my school (VJC), I would avoid it because the fare was simply too expensive. Anyway, 503 had been withdrawn, and things are back to square 1. (Students still need to change buses at Bedok Int.)<br><br>There also used to be Express 505 from Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah/WTC. It used to provide a non-stop link from my home in Bedok Nth to Bukit Merah. As a student, despite the high fare, I don't mind taking 505 because it's really FAST. I often took 505 when I went to CMPB or NUS. (It took only 15 minutes from Bedok Nth Rd to Jln Bukit Merah.) Unfortunately, 505 was withdrawn as the HDB hub moved from Bukit Merah to Toa Payoh, and commuters heading to Bukit Merah/WTC has to take the new 518 and change bus at Orchard. (As for me, I have to take 30 between Bedok and NUS every day. Although SBST introduced Fast Forward 30e, I would avoid it due to the high fares. Somemore 30e is not really that fast... During morning peak hour it gets jammed on the ECP anyway.)<br><br></div>

After all, 506 is quite empty during off-peak hours. Anyway I'm holding a student concession pass, so Express services are still too expensive for me. I'm not asking for normal concession fares (55 cents) for Express services. I'm happy if the fare can be reduced to $1, or even $1.50 (as long as it is lower than the normal $2++ fare.) Sometimes, students may need to rush from one point to another, but it's not very fair to make them pay the full express fares. Students have the need and want to travel fast, but not the demand. Since there is an excess of supply (bus seats) and the operational cost is the same whether the bus is full or empty, isn't it better to get more demand to match the excess supply?</div>
