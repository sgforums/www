              <p>LTA had built bus interchanges next to MRT stations, example Tampines, Pasir Ris, Clementi, Jurong East ...</p>
              <p>Is it a mistake for doing so???</p>
              <p>I realize for most bus interchanges, buses need to make many turns prior getting into the bus interchanges. And commuters normally need to walk a long distance into the bus interchanges.</p>
              <p>Most commuters normally need to walk for 10-15 minutes to the bus bay in the bus interchanges.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Will it be better if we build long bus bay along the MRT stations instead? Like the one in Kranji, or Buona Vista?</p>
              <p>And it actually make more sense in having bus interchanges to be located away from MRT stations. Example people rather make transfers along Commonwealth Ave [for Clementi Station] than going into Clementi Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>I hope Buona Vista and Ghim Moh bus terminal will remain where they are.</p>

              <p>I am suggesting having bus interchanges away from MRT stations. And have those bus services stop at bus stop next to MRT stations instead. Example people make transfer to 170, 160 at kranji at a bus stop rather than in a bus interchange instead.</p>
              <p>Example commuters make bus transfer easier at Commonwealth and Queenstown MRT stations, unlike their counterparts at Pasir Ris, they need not have to walk for 10 min to the bus bay, and the buses need not have to make many turns upon driving out/into the bus interchanges.</p>
              <p>Example bus 72 that ply between AMK and Tampines. Bus 72 pick up commuters from AMK and many alight at Hougang MRT, And at the same time many board the bus to proceed to Tampines. Transfer is a breeze for bus 72 at Hougang MRT.</p>

              <p>Integration is e key factor.</p>
              <p>If you need to walk so far to get to e bus interchange, something is really wrong.</p>
              <p>In any case, Opp Kranji MRT Station is terrible during the PM peak hours. You end up boarding the bus on the right lane all thks to e lorries.</p>

              <p>What I meant is that current bus interchanges example Tampinese and Pasir Ris were located 'far away' from MRT stations, that commuters now have to walk for 10 minutes to arrive at the bus bay at the bus interchanges. I propose having the buses to pick up at the door step like Commonwealth and Queenstown MRT instead.</p>
              <p>Why buses able to stop at the door step of Commonwealth and Queenstown MRT? Because some of the bus services terminating away from the 2 stations at Buona Vista and Ghim Moh.</p>
              <p>Of course Pasir Ris and Tampines have large population catchment, my suggestion may not be 'logical' however. For the buses may jam up the road instead.</p>

              <p>What logic is this.Â </p>
              <p>Can you just imagine waking up early in the morning, dragging your sorry ass tired body to board the bus to the bus terminal and then since it's located far away,then still walk 20 minutes to the MRT interchange?Â </p>
              <p>This is just an analogy here - yes your long bus bays could work, can they offer the amount of services and connections as compared to the terminal?Â </p>
              <p>The point of interchanges near MRT stations are for the ease of transition. You alight from the train, go to a terminal and there's a wider range of bus services to bring you to your location. Putting it far away is like saying, I place bar of soap in the kitchen but I bathe in the toilet.Â </p>
              <p>What you are just saying in your opinion is just to have a bigger bus stop outside MRT stations. Take for example Eunos interchange, they have a bus stop outside their interchange too.Â </p>

              <p>Putting Bus Interchange on top of the MRT (Toa Payoh) or Below the MRT station (Woodlands MRT) is not a bad idea.</p>
              <p>Some residence are next to the MRT and Bus interchange.. Compass point Condo...</p>
              <p>Maybe the question is not the proper integration of MRT and Bus Interchange but whether More Bus Interchange should be Included to reduce the size of very large Bus Interchange. Therefore reducing the walking distance.</p>
              <p>Even MRT interchange like Dhoby Ghaut MRT, I felt the walking distance is too long.. unlike Cityhall MRT interchange, or Raffles place.</p>
              <p>Sorry to deviate from main topic.. and during festive seasons.. some MRT stations are simply overcrowded...</p>
