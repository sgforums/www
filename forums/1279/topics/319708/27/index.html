              <p><br>If you want to take responsibility that the redeployment may not actually happen after its effective date, then go ahead.</p>
              <p>SBS 9454 R is still on 81. It was supposed to go over to 25<br>SBS 9489 R is still on 12. It was supposed to go over to 56<br>SBS 9163 E went over to 161 instead of SBS 9166 Y.</p>
              <p>If you post a redeployment you have to certify and assure that it will definitely happen otherwise what's the point of posting? To show that you have inside information? To show that you know these information before everyone else?</p>
              <p>You account and be responsible for what you post. That is why I do not recommend posting advanced redeployment. I would rather see the bus on service than simply sitting at home and clicking all day.</p>

              <p><br>If you say this, then what was the point of saying that I posted things that happened before the actual day itself, yesterday? I have people seeing 5 out of the 6 buses that I mentioned in service yesterday, or the day before. The last 1 (SBS 8275Y) is still not in service but it is in BNDEP, with SBS 3644Z replacing it for the time being. So definitely whatever I have mentioned yesterday, &gt;50% has already occured by the time I posted it yesterday morning.</p>
              <p>And I am not the sort that has so much time to spend at home, clicking away. I confirm what I am about to disseminate my information out by <strong>checking</strong> with others first. If not, like what you say, there is no point in informing. Do you seriously think I have so much free time?</p>
              <p>Things definitely can change. I've seen things that are not supposed to be occuring but they happen at the last minute. And I have also seen things that are supposed to be occuring, but they get pushed aside at the last minute.</p>
              <p>Pardon for being blunt here. I have seen 3 times whereby I post stuff and I am replied with sarcastic comments. When 199 &amp; 243 started K230, I posted the changes in redeployments the same night <strong>it had occured</strong>. Then I get a comment I am not supposed to get. Fine.</p>
              <p>1 week before 27 started K230 I posted that there was going to be. <strong>But that was because I had already checked, not through computer, but by the office staffs</strong>. And somehow or rather people get agitated. Not as in everyone, but specific people. Fine, I let it off.</p>
              <p>And now, it has been about a week since 8213/8228/8230 perm-ed 3. 8271 did on Friday, 8267 did yesterday. Good. I posted the redeployments. And I get the same sort of comments.</p>
              <p>I know there is a difference between cameo-ing and perm (And you don't need to tell me this), but I based it on the fact that 5 out of the 6 buses that I mentioned have already done 3, and thats why I post. I don't post for the sake of posting. I post to <strong>inform</strong>.</p>
              <p>Do you see <strong>everyone</strong> being irritated when I post "advanced deployments" of just 1 bus difference? But why is it that only you get agitated?</p>
              <p>My point is, not everyone here hates information being posted in advance. In fact, it is up to personal opinion. Fine if you feel angry that information that is posted in advance did not occur, and I sincerely apologise for that, but does everyone feel the same thing? I don't see ngjy22 feeling angry, I don't see the other friends I have feeling angry too. <strong>If you hate information being posted in advance, does it mean that everyone also has to hate the same way as you think?</strong></p>
              <p>I shall just rest my case here. And if you still want to discuss about it, send me a PM.</p>

              <p><br>8213 swap with 852 was posted by SBS233X earlier. that i rest my case.</p>
              <p>8228 replace the temp perm 3659 who replaced 3711 who went laid up. 8228 could have been perm since the 822x buses were perm on 3. That i also rest my case.</p>
              <p>8230 replaced the laid up 3700, should be perm around the same time as 8228.</p>
              <p>8267 8271 8275 replaces 73 3644 3669. 80U isnt in the picture. 73 and 3644 were still on 3 during the week afaik.</p>
              <p>I agree that its nice to post deployments in advanced only if they are true and accurate. However if in the event that it is not accurate are you going to bear the responsibility? If yes, gladly post whatever advance deployments you wish to post and get ready for comments that you may not want to digest well with.</p>

              <p><br>If you say this, then what was the point of saying that I posted things that happened before the actual day itself, yesterday? I have people seeing 5 out of the 6 buses that I mentioned in service yesterday, or the day before. The last 1 (SBS 8275Y) is still not in service but it is in BNDEP, with SBS 3644Z replacing it for the time being. So definitely whatever I have mentioned yesterday, &gt;50% has already occured by the time I posted it yesterday morning.</p>
              <p>And I am not the sort that has so much time to spend at home, clicking away. I confirm what I am about to disseminate my information out by <strong>checking</strong> with others first. If not, like what you say, there is no point in informing. Do you seriously think I have so much free time?</p>
              <p>Things definitely can change. I've seen things that are not supposed to be occuring but they happen at the last minute. And I have also seen things that are supposed to be occuring, but they get pushed aside at the last minute.</p>
              <p>Pardon for being blunt here. I have seen 3 times whereby I post stuff and I am replied with sarcastic comments. When 199 &amp; 243 started K230, I posted the changes in redeployments the same night <strong>it had occured</strong>. Then I get a comment I am not supposed to get. Fine.</p>
              <p>1 week before 27 started K230 I posted that there was going to be. <strong>But that was because I had already checked, not through computer, but by the office staffs</strong>. And somehow or rather people get agitated. Not as in everyone, but specific people. Fine, I let it off.</p>
              <p>And now, it has been about a week since 8213/8228/8230 perm-ed 3. 8271 did on Friday, 8267 did yesterday. Good. I posted the redeployments. And I get the same sort of comments.</p>
              <p>I know there is a difference between cameo-ing and perm (And you don't need to tell me this), but I based it on the fact that 5 out of the 6 buses that I mentioned have already done 3, and thats why I post. I don't post for the sake of posting. I post to <strong>inform</strong>.</p>
              <p>Do you see <strong>everyone</strong> being irritated when I post "advanced deployments" of just 1 bus difference? But why is it that only you get agitated?</p>
              <p>My point is, not everyone here hates information being posted in advance. In fact, it is up to personal opinion. Fine if you feel angry that information that is posted in advance did not occur, and I sincerely apologise for that, but does everyone feel the same thing? I don't see ngjy22 feeling angry, I don't see the other friends I have feeling angry too. <strong>If you hate information being posted in advance, does it mean that everyone also has to hate the same way as you think?</strong></p>
              <p>I shall just rest my case here. And if you still want to discuss about it, send me a PM.</p>

              <p><br>Perhaps you may want to indicate the redeployments as "wef xx/xx/xxxx" so as to clarify the details, in case some unsure bus spotters keep shooting you back.</p>
              <p>Just like how you posted the service 27/156/163 redeployment details as "wef today" (anyway thanks for the info too the other day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif">, went to understudy services 156 and 163 that time and verified that the info was correct).</p>
