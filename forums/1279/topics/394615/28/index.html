              <p>Accurately speaking the engine is mounted, on a tilted angle 30
              degrees NW to SE (as picture illustrates below). '30 degrees' is
              used by Scania to illustrate the engine placement as well, as it is
              'raised' 30 degrees from a flat position. Nonetheless 90 - 30 = 60
              which is also a correct representation. In that case, 60 degrees
              from upright.</p>
              <p><img src="http://minibusgrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/L113_CRL_Elbo_Engine_Map_Upload_2.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The main reason for this is to reduce compartment intrusion for
              lower entry (one-step or less) buses, at that time in Europe. Do
              note that this engine placement cannot be done to any existing
              upright mount engine, lots has to be done especially the engine oil
              pan, which enables the engine to suck up engine oil at a 90 degrees
              angle. Hence there is a 'out-of-shape' oil pan if you get to see
              the engine, you will understand how it looks like.</p>

              <p>I lik the floor design of the bus.Kinda looks lik 8031J's floor pattern.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""><br><br>And i m very glad tat they didnt folo the B9's seating layout at the rear of the lower and upper decks.I prefer tis style.The upper deck can hav more seats instead lik the LO3X/VO3X etc and no need to squeeze yrself to sit at the lower deck rear lik on the B9s.Good change by sbst.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""></p>

              <p>Frankly, the error message is because of one thing. I don't mind SLBP buses too, 66, 157, 174 and EB39 have SLBP buses and these services run near my residence also. No issue with depot, just the issue with the people there.</p>
              <p>Even the rumours that you are a staff of a certain department in SLBP, I still have to point this out, after a long duration of observation, from my own eyes and eyes that I borrowed.</p>
              <p>The <strong>error messages occur</strong> because <strong>SLBP does not top up Adblue chemicals for SBS8030L</strong>.</p>
              <p>No need to repeat that, humiliating enough, if depot does not take care of vehicle, should reject the vehicle and place at other places, <em>where economically possible</em>.</p>
              <p>chickenlittle2, why not you suggest to your superiors to install a Adblue pump at the depot? Perhaps you may get awarded under the suggestion scheme that your company offers.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this may lead to more new items added to SLBP when the time comes ;)</p>

              <p>for 8033D, i took it last sat with 9231S. the engine is hitting the surface of other parts of the bus. the radiator is roaring like crap and the engine is in bad shape and very noisy. hydraulic air raiser is malfunctioned. you call that good maintenance? one of the seats have broken cushions.</p>

              <p>7888k Did Jerk During the Journey But that was bcos BC accer and brake not it naturally will jerk. Overall The Ride Was Very Smooth, And Yea I agree With 7485P From The Buses And Examples He Showed Mi How SLBP Does "Good" Maintenance. 8030L Hit the 6th Gear at only abour 30km/h ? You call tat Good Maintenance ? 8033D With The Rubber Rubbing against the Wheel and Roaring can be heard from a distance Good Right? How Epic. Oh And Anyhow placing a Cardboard of anysize to State the Bus Svc Perm Svc no.? you call that good? i noe this has nth to do with maintenance but it tells us how crappy SLBP is, At least BNBP Puts A Nice printed Sticker with The Svc No. it Looks So Much nicer rather den place an anyhow size of Cardboard with The Svc No. Written on it or Use A Marker and Write on the bus So ugly.</p>
