                  ok.  I took this bus 2 weeks ago, I didn't hear the bus

              <p>If a bus that pop up error message that just come back
                  from the HQ. It tells us the job done at HQ is not
                  complete.  To me, 8030L gearbox is tuned similar to KUB
                  one. I dun see an issue.</p>
              <p>In fact, an unexpected ride with my friend exposed many badly
                  maintained buses. 8477G is one of them with super thick layer of
                  dust on the filter or A/C unit plus interior full of black
                  dust. Gearbox was not tuned properly. This adds on to SBS 8507D
                  which had thick layer of dust on the filter or A/C unit. SBS 8091K
                  is another vibration king.</p>
              <p>You see how the driver move off and stop sometimes and you will
                  feel the jerk.</p>

              <p>You want this to go into investigation, including your knowledge that there is a recall and you had knowledge of the results of the road test?</p>
              <p>I'm sure Volvo workshop personnel will not be happy to see this, especially with all the signs that the bus seems to be operated without Adblue, which is not within their control. For your information, Adblue needs to be filled as often as once every 2 days for local operating conditions. Volvo workshop can't station someone to just bring a container of Adblue to fill it at SLBP every 2 days at best.</p>
              <p>If you're not able to maintain the bus, maybe you should send your bus out instead of throwing all the blame on Volvo workshop, especially if you're not part of SLBP W/S you should not be sowing seeds of discontent between the two parties without any of them raising an official complaint.</p>

              <p>8030L gearbox has been pushed to the limits due to slbp's tuning. it keeps pushing forceful full acceleration at low gear and hit high gears at low speed with insufficient torque.</p>
              <p>also, the condition of 8033D is a lot left to be desired. go and sit 8031J and compare it with the other 2.</p>
              <p>the fact is someone is unable to face the facts so its best that people here go and get a taste of 8030L and 8033D for themselves, i believe you would agree with what i say. its just my 2cents worth onboard these 2 buses a week ago. should not be a problem to catch it, both of them are on full day (:</p>

              <p>I did heard about the recent recall of 8033D and tested fine. I had also took the bus and found that it is normal.</p>
              <p>I believe it is not just the Adblue issue. Do explain why this bus always breakdown when it comes back from HQ? Isn't checks should be done completely? Last time, it was the SCR issue.</p>
              <p>Putting all blames on SLBP workshop is also unfair. 8030L is the only single bus in the SBST fleet, it is normal that everyone will focus on this bus. Anyone, I do not want to talk too much of it.</p>

              <p><br> Thanks but I would like the timings from Shenton Way ter instead in

              <p>the timings for this bus can be hard to get. Service 133 does jumpbus.</p>

              <p>I did heard about the recent recall of 8033D and tested fine. I had also took the bus and found that it is normal.</p>
              <p>I believe it is not just the Adblue issue. Do explain why this bus always breakdown when it comes back from HQ? Isn't checks should be done completely? Last time, it was the SCR issue.</p>
              <p>Putting all blames on SLBP workshop is also unfair. 8030L is the only single bus in the SBST fleet, it is normal that everyone will focus on this bus. Anyone, I do not want to talk too much of it.</p>

              <p>how about 8031J then? it is also the only single bus in SBST's fleet. yet when i take it i feel that its better than 8030L in terms of its performance. 8030L is tuned to the extent that it becomes underpowered at 6th gear. the tuning undermines the performance of the bus where even the KUB now performs almost at the same rate as 8030L. previously 8030L can overtake other bus upon startup. now its less likely to occur</p>

              <p>yeah...8031J has lower power and torque somemore lor. though 8031J seems quite problematic, with it going in and out (based on my observations), it is still very smooth in terms of ride quality. if 8030L had its original tuning and received proper maintenance, it can still beat the Citaro in terms of pick-up, but now, looking at the situation, it seems to be otherwise.</p>
