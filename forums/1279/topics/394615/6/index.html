              pretty well. But IMO, the eye-opener must be the B9TL. The B9TL
              climbs faster than say....the MKIIIs and the MKIV DMs. In fact, its
              the MKIV DMs (the ZF ones) that struggle more than the MKIIIs. The

              <p>The one I cannot trust to climb these hills would be the VOs.
              Fortunately none has passed through that area....yet. At least as
              far as I know.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>IMO, the one that has the least difficulty for the NUS services

              <p>Official pictures in the official presses might be most unlikely, just like the Volvo B7RLE and MAN 18.240HOCL demos. This is an interesting addition, after the Scania BR112H double decker in the 1980s. Curious is, why was it acquired by SBS in the 1980s since it was a second hand bus from a UK bus co.? </p>
              <p>But since it is registered, it should be out in a week or 2.</p>
              <p>But hopefully this will be the only demo, since it is only EURO 4. And I have not heard of a EURO 5 K310UD. It will be quite contradicting for SBST to buy EURO 4 buses, since they have already moved up the trend to get EURO 5 buses. Hopefully more EURO 5 Volvo B9TLs.</p>

              <p>One way to look out for Euro 4 or 5/EEV engines is by the capacity. 8867 cc for Euro 4, and 9291 cc for Euro 5/EEV versions. What is changed is the bore of the engine, 3 mm more for each cylinder, relates to increased combustion capability and translated to more power for engines on a certain range, that is why you see a 270 to 280 and 310 to 320 increase.</p>
              <p>Euro 4 169 kW: DC 9-16 230<br>EEV 169 kW: DC 9-30 230<br>Euro 4 228 kW: DC 9-18 310</p>
              <p>DC 9 engine type, -16/18/30 engine designation, 230/310 horsepower (metric).</p>
              <p>The 228 kW engine has 1550 Nm torque, highest torque in city-buses locally till date (true also for the power output). No foreseeable problems for climbing local gradients or starting up with heavy load.</p>

              <p>Misconception: Scania K series buses vibrate cause their engines are mounted 30 degrees/temporary position.<br>Truth: K series uses upright engines as opposed to the L series.</p>
              <p>Disc brakes are used instead of drum brakes and used properly will not jepoardise braking. Cars use them as well and braking is more efficient.</p>
              <p>Engine brake is actually quite weak on the Scania K. Strong retarder (this used instead of the term engine brake) is like the OC.</p>

              <p>Engine mount changed would likely mean the mountings (with vibration absorbing paddings) changed. An engine cannot change its mounting angle/position anyway a person likes as this will affect the engine's performance and safety.</p>
              <p>Take a L and K engine for example, the former can be mounted 30 degrees to the side is because the oil pan is 'slanted' also, so that lubricant oil can be sucked 90 degrees upwards for use on the engine. Cylinders are moving in a 30 degrees 'slanted' motion when you look straight at the engine.</p>
              <p>If you mount a K engine slanted, likely the engine will start to vibrate hard along the axis of mounting and oil cannot be sucked up for use, causing the engine to damage and destroy itself!</p>

              <p>5 instead of 6 cylinders on a technical point would increase per-cylinder power output and require high per-cylinder efficiency.</p>
              <p>In cars we deal with per-liter power (efficiency). How much power can a car produce with that displacement. However, one good quote that my friend reminded me of, which I appreciate a lot especially when it came to the comparison of Citaro and OC500LE engines.</p>
              <p><strong>There is no replacement for displacement</strong>.</p>
              <p>Smaller engines tend to stress out with more power they can give. Hence when you look at the 8867 cc engine, 230 would be a comfortable range for the engine to work at compared to 310. If you like a powerful, responsive and fuel saving 310 horse engine, I would look at the 10 to 12-liter range.</p>
              <p>I would like to clear some misconceptions here.</p>
              <p>We should not look at how much cylinders an engine have, but the power per-liter that an engine can give and its efficiency and actual usage. Common misconception is by default, looking at how many cylinders an engine has and determine if the engine is powerful or not, then why not mount a V24 (24 cylinders) on a bus?</p>
