              <p>I did heard about the recent recall of 8033D and tested fine. I
                                  had also took the bus and found that it is normal.</p>
              <p>I believe it is not just the Adblue issue. Do explain why this
                                  bus always breakdown when it comes back from HQ? Isn't checks
                                  should be done completely? Last time, it was the SCR issue.</p>
              <p>Putting all blames on SLBP workshop is also unfair. 8030L
                                  is the only single bus in the SBST fleet, it is normal
                                  that everyone will focus on this bus. Anyone, I do not

              <p>These were true messages displayed on SBS8030L in 2010, the most recent only last week, and over the span of several withdrawal from service.

              <p>Of course, not to forget to mention, when the top message was displayed the bus was already belching out black smoke at first gear start-off low rev.</p>
              <p>Without Adblue chemicals, most likely the SCR catalyst tank will clog up with soot and eventually exhaust will be discharged as-is. Exhaust as-is meaning that its Euro 3 or below. Euro 3 or below means its not the vehicle's certified exhaust emission.

              <p>That is not true all the time. What are the reasons it broke down, and are not linked to the Adblue system? There is, but most probably not on the first day.</p>
              <p>I am sure the Adblue issue of this bus is more serious than other issues regarding the same vehicle, just by the look from the <em>outside</em>.</p>
              <p>You are the <em>inside</em> fellow. You can tell us (where possible not infringing company laws) what went wrong. But the warning messages I have to say about, because you don't see them everyday and without the messages one can say there is nothing wrong/cannot pinpoint the problem of the bus.</p>
              <p>Scania K buses use EGR system. B7RLE Euro 4/5/EEV uses SCR system. Comparing them directly are like comparing duck and chicken eggs. é¸¡é¥­åŠ æ³¸è›‹ã€‚</p>

              <p>I respect your vast knowledge of buses in SLBP, u seem so familiar with wad's on with every single buses, their maintenance process and even the technical aspect of buses which i honestly admit i do not possess.</p>
              <p>As much as you love SLBP to bits, you gotta admit there are certainly flaws in various aspect and i dare say it is the same for every depot, the way you defend issues at times really reflect how immature you are. Sure we each have our own prefences and i believe each bus fan have a depot which is their first choice but not once have we created a stir as often as you always with your comments.</p>
              <p>My post here is not to create another flame war but rather i hope you can be more sensible when defending issues rgding SLBP. Senior or juniors, it's our hobby to share, post and discuss the thing we all love in common. Please stop making this forum a war place and let us all enjoy our hobby in a more peaceful way. =)</p>

              <p><br>True, you are right! I had mentioned that there are flaws in every depot. SLBP is of course not the best and I see most of the depots met the standards. It takes 2 hands to clap and similarly an argument.  In this forum, we can see many PRO- AMDEP/BRBP bus fans and treat this depot as their favourite one.</p>
              <p>Talking abt bus fans, isn't bus fan loves buses rather than complaining buses. Bus fan should report to the company of any defects rather than complaining here. Somehow, I dun see true bus fans here compared to the bus fans in HK. </p>

              <p>Besides the SCR issue, can you tell me why it always breakdown
                  everytime it come back on service on the 1st day?</p>
              <p>I dun see the KUB in SLBP have the same problem leh.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't think any of us can tell you why it is removed from service after maintenance. But KUBs don't face this problem because for one thing, SBST has far more experience maintaining the 1000+ KUBs on the roads. Also, KUBs have EGR, not SCR. SBST doesn't not have much experience with SCR-based emmision reduction systems. The shit performance of 8030L a few days after Volvo maintenance is likely due to the empty AdBlue tank, which SLBP doesn't give a shite about since they don't have an AdBlue station. Probably why SBST didn't want the OC demo, since they can't even be arsed to get an AdBlue pump. The OC engine will automatically downrate itself should the tank run empty to keep within Euro V, so I should assume the same applies to the B7RLE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So why not get SLBP to install an AdBlue pump? Not saying SLBP is the worst lar, but it's going down the road to nowhere. Best to keep within laws.</p>

              <p>That is not true all the time. What are the reasons it broke down, and are not linked to the Adblue system? There is, but most probably not on the first day.</p>
              <p>I am sure the Adblue issue of this bus is more serious than other issues regarding the same vehicle, just by the look from the <em>outside</em>.</p>
              <p>You are the <em>inside</em> fellow. You can tell us (where possible not infringing company laws) what went wrong. But the warning messages I have to say about, because you don't see them everyday and without the messages one can say there is nothing wrong/cannot pinpoint the problem of the bus.</p>
              <p>Scania K buses use EGR system. B7RLE Euro 4/5/EEV uses SCR system. Comparing them directly are like comparing duck and chicken eggs. é¸¡é¥­åŠ æ³¸è›‹ã€‚</p>

              <p>Great understanding of the tech issue. That why I say B7RLE is not easy and good to maintain compared to Scania. Sometimes the use of urea is quite difficult to know cos it base on driving distance and conditions. Somemore if I am nt wrong, this is the only bus which uses urea. </p>

              <p>i nv said amdep/brbp was perfect. it you who post all the good stuff about slbp and bad stuff of amdep/brbp and nothing else like slbp is the best and amdep/brbp is the worse just trace back all your posts, its fact. period.</p>
              <p>let's end the quarrels. learn to stop continually praising slbp for theiur good stuff and criticising amdep/brbp for their bad stuff and give very little credit to the bad about slbp and good of amdep/brbp. though i doubt by saying this, helps in any way.</p>
              <p>i do not praise alot about amdep/brbp, you can clearly see in my posts. i only tell you am/br is better than sl in terms of condition of buses cos whenever you talk about am/br is nothing good de. and when someone talks bad about sl, you get very reactive.</p>
