If a new service is introduced which duplicate some of its own existing route, the number of passengers will drop on its existing services as some passengers will turn to take this new service. If there is no route duplication, they will expect you to take the existing service and transfer to another service somewhere else. At the same time, SMRT has to incur expenses for new service unless the service is a very profitable one to breakeven the expense of which SMRT will think it is quite unlikely to happen. Since this is the case, there will not be a need to buy new buses as using existing old buses in its fleet will do. This can result in maximizing their profit.<br><br>What SMRT is trying to do currently is play around with its existing bus services like changing frequency, amending the route, introducing short trips and introducing fast forward. They will only introduce new feeder/short haul services if the area is being ply by only this new service.<br>Evidence: 882, 900A, 922.<br><br>902 is like a short working trip for 169 which is not really a new service to me. 882 is not really a new service as well. That is to cover the missing link to Sembawang Park after 167 was amended! In this way they can cheat the public and the authorities that they have introduced 882 and 902 as new services! SMRT is SMART! Notice the only difference is the letter A between these 2 words! Upon mentioning this cheating case, I remembered 970 was introduced to cover former 5 after the dispute from the public of which TIBS claimed that they had introduced 970 as a new service when someone wrote in to complain to TIBS about new service introduction!<br><br>SMRT likes to trade or I would say compete with SBS Transit bus services in the past. (ie. SBS Transit introduce a new service to its rival's territory of which SMRT will eventually follows)<br>Evidence: 168 with 969, 161 with 965, 160 with 950, 39 with perhaps 966? What happen to the trade for 85? SMRT is no longer interested in trading currently and in the future?<br><br>If we look at why SBS Transit will introduce new services in a way that can hurt SMRT business is that most of the train services are operated by its rival SMRT. By doing so, they can steal some passengers from the train.<br>Explanation: By providing direct link implies there is no longer a need to take SMRT train or take SMRT train and transfer to a SBS Transit bus, thus this can reduce the number of passengers onboard SMRT trains.<br><br>The winners will be those living in places like Clementi, Toa Payoh, Tampines as they can choose to take SMRT trains or SBS Transit buses to their destination. This is what I mean by there is "real" competition!</div>
