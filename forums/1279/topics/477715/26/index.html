              SBST still not that bad consider the huge fleets,3300 vs 1150 buses

                   should improve when bus contracts model take effect. but again depend on how the contract specifies in areas such as maintenance. or else the awarded bidder will cut corners and end up with badly maintained fleet esp when contract is ending and they more bochap. also; will there be strict and regular audits to ensure the operator performs and maintain the buses properly and no alibaba.  or else history will repeat itself like what carbikebus mentioned earlier.

              <p>exactly! i still see 307P buses with less than 10 pax onboard..307 BCs are complaining that no one dare to board 307P, and everyone squeeze onto 307 even though its full...and on multiple occasions 307 and 307P pair together, sometimes 307, 307E and 307P all come together.</p>

              <p>LTA should not have started 307P in the first place, instead they need to know that they should more buses (all BSEP fleet adds) on 307 itself, at least 2 buses (1 A/P and 1 split) will do already... Then the frequency can improve and finally people no need to complain of overcrowding on 307 and all this 307P would not be there in the first place... LTA, please wake up.</p>

              pressed the bell, but the female BC was unaware of the bell sounding as it was
              too soft... When I told her about this just as she was about to turn to Punggol
              Central, she had to swerve into the small waiting area after the bus stop to
              let the passenger alight... She asked me if it was her fault or the passenger's
              fault. I told her that the bell was too soft, that was why she was unaware of
              the bell sounding. I told her to tell the depot about this issue, so this

              <p>Anyway, only for today (due to NDP rehearsal today):</p>
              <p>Bus services which end their trips at Marina Centre Ter (like 171 and 75) had to loop at Temasek Ave (Opp The Ritz-Carlton bus stop), as the parking lots for the bus services at the terminal area were blocked... This meant that buses had to start trips immediately from The Esplanade. The bus stop (Seating Gallery) outside the floating platform was barricaded due to the NDP rehearsal. Thus, passengers going for the NDP rehearsal had to alight at The Esplanade, leading to huge crowds at the bus stop...</p>

              <p>Agree totally! Just hope that later LTA dont remove all these services (240P, 268P, 307P ... ) saying low loading and that these services (240, 268, 307) are not having heavy loads ....</p>
