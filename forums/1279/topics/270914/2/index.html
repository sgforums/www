I feel that our area though there is no MRT line plying there, it is rather convenient in terms of bus network. There are a lot of options and besides, there are buses that link up to all the three MRT lines currently NSL, EWL and NEL and also CCL in the future. This is probably due to the well planned bus routes by SBST.<br><br></div>

Like I took 157 and 132 last time, it's only about 1 hr 30 min, about the same as bus transfer train.
