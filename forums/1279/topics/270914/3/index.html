They have attitudes and feelings. From what i know , SMRT SLs can have godly tight schedules . Whenever a human is under tremendous stress, he/she can display bad behavior . Not all SL i know shows attitude. Even SBST does have such incidents , not always SMRT.</div>

Don't forget my SBS 3600 A on Service 125 incident at St Mike... Driver even stop the bus (with passengers somemore) and walked towards me which is the opposite side of the 1 way road.. That's when I purposely ignore his yelling and horning (with my MP3 on...)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, nothing wrong with snapping photos at public roads, provided it's not within the vicinity of bus interchanges/terminals (exclude places like Tuas terminal..) Some drivers are just too over sensitive at we people snapping photos of their bus... They will ask questions like "why you taking photos of ME?" where our intention is only to snap the photo of the bus and not the driver itself....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
