              <p>The potential problems with leasing A95 to TTS could be that training of engineering staffs and maintain spare parts. This would not be very economical for only two buses.</p>

              <p>If you don't know MAN A22  A24 &amp; A95 has the same engine with A22 &amp; A95 sharing the same power output at 320bhp while A24 is at 360bhp . All 3 models has the  same MAN engine D2066 it the only difference in power output  control via Ecu  So TTS could actually lease some A95 because TTS has knowledge in maintaining MAN A22 which is identical to A95 just with 2 decks  From a maintenance stand point it will be a small learning curve for TTS engineers but since they have base knowledge of MAN D2066 engine  the need to learn how to maintain the chassis. just </p>

              <p>If you don't know MAN A22  A24 &amp; A95 has the same
                  engine with A22 &amp; A95 sharing the same power output at 320bhp
                  while A24 is at 360bhp . All 3 models has the  same MAN engine
                  D2066 it the only difference in power output  control via
                  Ecu  So TTS could actually lease some A95 because TTS has
                  knowledge in maintaining MAN A22 which is identical to A95 just
                  with 2 decks  From a maintenance stand point it will be a
                  small learning curve for TTS engineers but since they have base
                  knowledge of MAN D2066 engine  the need to learn how to
                  maintain the chassis. just </p>
