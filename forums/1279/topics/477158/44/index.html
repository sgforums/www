              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I tried it many times before so many fernvale flats were up. Last time when it goes fully by TPE instead of sengkang east/west way, it was 30 min. Now by sengkang east/west way and jalan Kayu, it is at most 40 to 45 min. As for 60 to 75 min, i doubt so. Anyway i will try again later this afternoon to gauge the timing again. As each has its own opinion, it is a fast service from sengkang to yishun. It is considered fast from Punggol east to yishun. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr smb128B, sbs 85 reg no SBS8993H has just reached compass point bus stop outside Blk 323B along sengkang east rd. Time is 4.29pm. So basically 24 min from yishun int to sengkang int compass point. Cheers. </p>
              <p>And I forget to explain that there are some people at the Far East of Punggol taking direct sbs 85 from Punggol to yishun. This is a direct service instead of taking sbs 83 and transferring to smrt 965 along Punggol road which basically involves a transfer. Time taken will be similar for both cases. Or those who really need to take smrt 965 to go beyond yishun interchange. Sbs 85 only stops there. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I have alighted sbs 85 at Punggol int. The time is 4.48pm. Total journey from yishun int to Punggol int is 43 min. Now my 40 min is pretty closer than yours 60 to 75 min. Now we know who do not have common sense, huh??? So next time, please do not start abuse people before you comment, ok? Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong. 60 min to 75 min is overkill. You can take the service and judge for yourself. 55 min is a wrong estimation too. This is a fast route by any estimation. I have taken this service countless times before I pass my judgement. Just a while ago at 4.05pm, i take this service again. It lasts 43 min from start to end from 4.05pm to 4.48pm. Moreover, the loading for this service is not high. There are not expected to be much delay. You will know if you take this service often. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Well, the estimation actually come from officlal Singapore public transport website...It is just that the time taken to load and unload passengers onto the bus may have been the burden to increase the total time taken to travel...I suppose that not much passengers have boarded service 85 on your trip to Punggol to Yishun?</p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, well this is not my first trip on sbs 85. I have taken countless times for sbs 85. Previously I have even had 38 mins before for this service. Please do not trust the timings for those official websites too much. Please take the bus services to have a feel of the timing. For sbs 85, the loadings have always been very constant throughout. Seldom there is an extremely high loading. This probably explains the low frequency of this service. Once you take this bus service regularly, you will definitely agree with me that the timing is estimated to be 40 to 45 min. At the worst, it will be 50 to 55 min which I believe to be too much. But definitely 60 to 75 min is extreme. Totally don't agree. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Well, there are a few previous cases where I checked the
              corresponding estimated travel time with the services I have taken
              from one destination to another and it is correct somehow...at
              least you did mention the maximum is 55 mins when the loading is
              high.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, ok on those previous cases which you took are accurate to the dot. But for sbs 85, certainly not. 55 min may be the one on the official site but it is certainly less than that. For 60-75 min, definitely out of target for sbs 85. 60-75 min may be more appropriate for sbs 50 start from end during peak hours. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, how I wish they will extend some more services to Punggol central but it looks highly unlikely at the moment.</p>
              <p>Because there are many alternatives at the moment.</p>
              <p>1. sbs 85 serving whole of Punggol central (especially those staying Blk 637-652 Blk 160-166) and Punggol east (blk 167-168), it takes 30 min to reach khatib mrt and 36 min to reach yishun mrt for those staying at the Far East.</p>
              <p>2. smrt 965 along Punggol rd (need take sbs 82/136 plus walk across bridge to transfer to smrt 965) --more suitable for those living near Punggol mrt to go Punggol rd transfer. Due to the need to transfer, time to khatib mrt and yishun mrt will depend on waiting time for smrt 965. Expected to be slightly better than sbs 85 timing, albeit only slightly better. If take sbs 83 transfer, not much difference because sbs 83 goes 1 round in Punggol. (In that case, may as well take sbs 85)</p>
              <p>3. Sbs 39/ smrt 858 along TPE stop. For those staying in east Punggol, take sbs 3 plus walk across bridge to transfer to smrt 858 along TPE stop. For those staying near mrt, take sbs 34 plus walk across bridge to transfer to smrt 858 to go khatib mrt or yishun mrt. Time estimated to be close to smrt 965.</p>
              <p>Now there is 39, 85, 161, 168, 858, 965, 969 to either khatib, yishun, sembawang, admiralty and woodlands. So don't think they will extend 961 to Punggol at this moment. Cheers. </p>

              <p>But how? You cannot remove the Khatib link... better to have a new service going via Yishun ave 1, Seletar Link to Punggol. Considering how huge Yishun town is becoming and the developments along Ring Road, ave 6 etc.. makes sense to introduce a new trunk service.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I do not force my opinion on all that sbs 85 is a very winding route. From start to end, it is only 45 min. Not the 60 to 75 min that was claimed and he admitted it. Go take it yourself if you do not believe. I am not those kind of proud person and I have never ever shown how great I am. So stop your accusations on me. I merely defended myself when smb128B asks me whether I have any common sense! It is always my right to defend when false accusations fly around. By the way, this does not concern you so what are you trying to do by writing such a reply???</p>
              <p>I have reiterated in an earlier paragraph that for the Far East Punggol residents (Blk 637 to Blk 652, Blk 160A to Blk 168B), it is considered direct to khatib/yishun. It is only 33 min to khatib mrt then without any need for transfer. For those residents nearer Punggol mrt, it may be winding so I advise them to go take sbs 82/136 transfer to smrt 965 along Punggol rd. So let's be clear! For those near mrt side, it is winding. For those near Riveria LRT, it is not. One road on, they are out to sengkang east drive! </p>
              <p>Obviously, either you choose to ignore the earlier paragraphs and not deal with actual facts or you are one who only join in together to launch personal attacks without any facts/knowledge to back you up. We do not envisage such stuff.</p>
              <p>We are all here to talk about bus knowledge about each and every route and certainly not to do what you think we are. There is no prize or reward for trying to show how great one is and we are all busy working adults and certainly no time for those childish thinking like yours ''but you have to force your opinion on everyone here and show how great you are''. So childish man. Let's move on!</p>

              <p>sv 332 - I had also proposed this route before... will be very beneficial to residents along st 21/24... I would only make it go via Jurong Gateway rd rather than loop around st 11... as 333 is there for it... This will provide fast connectivity to those transferring by bus to take 332 even to the new hospital complex. I think this will be a good route.</p>
