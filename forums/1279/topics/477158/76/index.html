              <p>If we look at the service number 164, possibilities (among SMRT territories) are:</p>
              <p>- Woodlands: There are services 161, 168 and 169 there. But doesn't make sense to me as there are already many services such as 161, 168, 858, 969 to Woodlands passing by Punggol. And doesn't make sense to use SLE to Woodlands as there's 161 for NE side, and NSL and TEL for YCK and Upp Thomson.</p>
              <p>- Sembawang: There are services 167 and 169 (to some extent) there. Possible as Sembawang already needs many more services, and there's development at Yishun North (hence Canberra MRT). But still doesn't make sense to ply SLE (in fact, even less sense).</p>
              <p>- Bukit Panjang: If 164 really plies SLE, then I guess this should be the best answer... And Bukit Panjang really needs a service to NE side. But service number wise, the only justification is 184. And maybe 174 to Beauty World.</p>
              <p>- Bukit Batok: SMRT is gonna lose it anyway... But at least there is 174 there so it makes some sense to use the number 164. </p>
              <p>Anyway, no matter which SMRT territory it is, good news for Punggol residents who are dying for new services. But, IMHO, let's not be too excited for now... In case it ends up like the Punggol-Tampines 164 or Punggol-Sengkang West 164.</p>

              <p>- Bukit Batok: SMRT is gonna lose it anyway... But at least
              there is 174 there so it makes some sense to use the number

              <p>Anyway, no matter which SMRT territory it is, good news for

              not be too excited for now... In case it ends up like the
              Punggol-Tampines 164 or Punggol-Sengkang West 164.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, there is a big difference. Sbs 161, 168, smrt 858, 969 are just passing by TPE stop nearby Punggol. They are not dedicated services going into Punggol. Punggol has so many HDB flats and those mentioned services passing by TPE stop only serve a few blocks directly. All the rest still need to transfer from other buses to this stop and worse cross the super long bridge. So your statement about many services to woodlands hold no truth. </p>
              <p>Let's choose to believe TIB1234T since he is so sincere to inform all of us here. He may have known the exact destinations for both ends already. One side is Punggol and one side is SMRT territory. Let's give him benefit of the doubt because he may be bounded by rules not to divulge as he may be a high ranking officer with the relevant authorities. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Numbering or not, eventually there would still be deviations. Perhaps for convenience' sake.</p>
              <p>41 and 49 are the smallest service numbers that only serve the west side (not counting the cross-island ones such as 14 or 30). Previously it was 78 and 79. Neighbouring services 39, 40, 42, 50 ... all do not.</p>

              <p>Like I said, those listed are just some of the numbering inconsistencies. You can name them, but the list just goes on.</p>
              <p>As for the first point, I was talking about strictly west-side serving services, namely 41, 49, 78, 79, 98 and the like. 48 falls in the same category as cross-islanders 7, 10, 14, 30, etc., so I didn't bother mentioning it.</p>
