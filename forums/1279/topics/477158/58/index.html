              <p>I agree 51 route needs to be made short but it can only be possible if they introduce another service from Jurong to city. Remember that Havelock-Ganges-Alexandra do not have too many bus services. 51 is an important trunk here. You cannot cut short 51 if you do not introduce another service covering its route. </p>
              <p>Also 51 is the only service connecting West Coast to Alexandra and beyond.</p>

              <p>If there is any route in Jurong East area that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not well planned: it is <strong>sv
              333</strong></span></p>
              <p>I often see so many empty buses on sv 333 as it is not the
              preferred choice for anyone. Even now at IMM, if sv 990 comes
              first, people would prefer it to Jurong East compared to sv
              333.</p>
              <p><strong>Lets take a look: </strong></p>
              <p>For st 32 residents, hardly see many ppl boarding sv 333,
              instead walk to JE Ave 1 and take 99/334 to MRT.</p>
              <p>For JE Ave 1 residents, clearly everyone prefers sv 98 to JE
              except those who want to go to IMM board sv 333</p>
              <p>For Toh Guan Rd residents, they prefer sv 52/105/183 to JE
              except those who want to go to say Townhall rd to transfer
              (miniscule #)</p>
              <p>For IMM, sv 333 was the preferred option until sv 990 was
              introduced. I think still at JE Interchange, people prefer sv 333
              as it starts from there rather than take 990 outside
              interchange.</p>
              <p>Overall, never really see this bus full... and on many peak
              timings also see it quite empty. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi. I am sorry. I disagree with your comment about 333 having many empty buses. I was on 333 during evening peak hour around two weeks ago. The bus was relatively packed.</p>
              <p>333 is a feeder for people staying in between Jurong East and Bukit Batok MRT Stations &amp; people staying at Jurong East Avenue 1 to connect to Jurong East MRT Station, while provide a connection to the market/neighbourhood centre/sports complex at Chinese Garden.</p>

              <p>Are we talking about the same service? I don't think 333 goes to Chinese Garden. And Jurong East Ave 1 residents take 98 to Jurong East MRT, those near Polyclinic even prefer 99/334 to sv 98. sv 333 is the last option, and no one in their right mind would take it to MRT if you know how long winding its route is. </p>

              <p>I am sorry. In my opinion, if the extension of 49 is merely to make it ply the AYE and Jurong Town Hall Road to Jurong East Bus Interchange, I feel that it would be a waste of resources and a duplication with the MRT. </p>
              <p>People staying in Taman Jurong can take 240, 246/154 to MRT and take 98, 49 back home, via Lakeside MRT Station. The time taken is shorter than if they take bus to/fro home and Jurong East MRT Station, even if the bus takes the most direct route (ie. via AYE).</p>
              <p>If 49 is extended to Jurong East, the purpose is very likely not to provide bus link to Jurong East MRT Station. Instead, it may be to provide bus link to industrial areas south of Taman Jurong which may be weak or absent, and since it would become near to Jurong East Bus Interchange, might as well make it terminate there.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, if 49 is to terminate at a bus interchange, it may be better to terminate at Boon Lay Bus Interchange instead. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Extending it to Boon Lay Bus Interchange can provide for a currently-absent link between Jurong West Street 42 and Jurong West Town Centre (Jurong Point, Jurong West Library, Safra, Jurong Central Park, etc.), and cater to a possible increase in population at Boon Lay when all the new BTO units are occupied.

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, please always remember when a new service sbs 49 is initially introduced, it was meant to connect jurong west st 51 and jurong west st 42 residents a fast link to lakeside Mrt station. By proposing a longer route to the interchange (Boon Lay or JE), please reflect whether the initial intention will be compromised and if so, if there are any other alternatives or any solutions for a lesser impact. That should be the objective of public transport. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I don't think so BIAAT (that's what I'll call you :D )</p>
              <p>There is sv 79 that does the same route and I don't see point of the major duplication. AYE for me does make sense bcoz the industrial area around AYE today is poorly connected to Jurong MRT. Either ppl take 154 to Lakeside or take 154 to Clementi. Would be good to give a direct connection to Jurong East.</p>
              <p>Also for Taman Jurong residents, taking 49 to Jurong East via AYE will be faster than taking 98 via Jurong West Ave 1 / Jurong East Ave 1. So I do see potential for the service. </p>

              <p>Namly Ave is mostly low rise private housing (bungalows, semi-d etc), most people living there have their own cars to get around, and ridership would probably be low even if there's a bus svc. SIM is walkable to bus stops at the main road. Except for svc 4 to Flora Rd (which has some condos), we don't really see new bus svcs to private estates, mostly legacy svcs like 317 and 42.</p>
              <p>That said, there could be a premium or peak hour svc for Namly Ave to CBD if there is demand, similar to some other private estates like Sunset Way or Chestnut Ave.</p>

              <p>It is a good route. I had suggested something similar previously, just that my route started from Bishan.</p>
              <p>Bishan Interchange -- Bishan Road -- AMK Ave 1 -- AMK Ave 3 -- AMK Ave 4 -- AMK Ave 5 -- AMK Ave 6 -- AMK Ave 9 and continued almost the same way just that after TP ave 4 -- TP st 41 -- TP Ave 9 -- TP st 45 -- TP Ave 7 -- Loyang Ave -- Pasir Ris Dr 3 -- Pasir Ris Interchange.</p>
              <p>* Connects Bishan (CCL) to AMK west town</p>
              <p>* Connects AMK West town to YCK MRT</p>
              <p>* New connection for Sengkang West/East way w/ Sengkang MRT connection</p>
              <p>* Provides relief to sv 27</p>
              <p>* Works as intra-town within tampines town, especially for tp ave 9 and st 45 residents. also provides latter connection to pasir ris</p>
              <p>* Connects Pasir Ris Dr 3 to Loyang, Tampines (no service today)</p>

              <p>Nope, 63's route should remain as it is an important bus route for R.T residents connecting them between Tiong Bahru Mrt and Jalan Rumah Tinggi but 36 extended to Bukit Merah sounds okay to me,  kinda resembles the old 16's route.</p>

              <p>36 cannot be extended, unless you have another service looping at Tomlinson road. Please note there are many people who transfer from other services to take sv 36 to Tanglin road/Orchard road from Somerset/Orchard Boulevard side. </p>
              <p>When sv 36 turns onto Tanglin, you will always see 10-15 pax on-board. These people will surely get upset if there is no alternative provided. </p>
              <p>Also 36 to Bukit Merah - which route to follow? From Orchard Boulevard you already have 123, 132 to Bukit Merah. From Somerset side, you already have sv 14, 16, 123, 175 to Bukit Merah. From Scotts, you have sv 5, 132 to Bukit Merah. What special advantage is sv 36 going to provide by extending to Bukit Merah.</p>
