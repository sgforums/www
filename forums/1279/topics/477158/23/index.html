              <p>Hi mr Darrylpohmaple, it will not happen. For your new amended sectors, it is duplicating sbs 197. For your previous sector, it duplicates sbs 196. It loses its current loading along Jalan bukit merah, queensway, commonwealth ave and north buona vista road. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Recently, my concession pass expired and I started to realise the benefit of taking MRT instead of a direct bus: it is shorter, faster and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cheaper</strong></span>. So out of boredom, I thought that maybe I should try to re-design the feeder bus network in Jurong West extension area, to make it faster and shorter for people to get to/from the nearest MRT station from/to their homes, while pay less bus fare and get more of the money they put inside their MRT/bus cards.</p>
              <p>As I randomly drew lines here and there to try to make it faster and shorter for one to get to a particular neighbourhood from the MRT, I felt that I might have come up with a set of feeder bus routes that is (slightly) better than the current one.</p>
              <p>Thus, I am writing this post to suggest creating two new feeder bus services and editing one existing feeder bus service.</p>

              <li>*With the usual traffic congestion at Jurong West Avenue 4 and Jalan Boon Lay every morning and evening, many people staying at Neighbourhood 7 would prefer to take 192/193/243G instead to get to/fro Boon Lay Bus Interchange, since it is faster and shorter.</li>
              <li>*Furthermore, when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, there is a possibility that either 192, 193 or both will nolonger go to Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</li>
              <li>*So might as well edit bus 242 to skip Jalan Boon Lay and go directly to N7 via Jurong West Street 64, to benefit people staying at N7 while anticipate a possible loss link in future.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>*With more people (moving in via BTO) staying in Boon Lay than originally (in flats that were already demolished under SERS), there may be a sustainable demand for a new feeder bus service to serve the North part of Boon Lay.</li>
              <li>*This would complement feeder bus service 240, which is already being complemented by a Peak-Period-Short-Service 240P.</li>
              <li>*It can also compensate residents staying at Jalan Boon Lay for the loss of link if bus service 242 goes directly to N7 via Jurong West Street 64.</li>

              <ul>
              <li>*With this new feeder bus service, people staying at blk 974-980 would not have to leave their estate and cross the road to the other bus stop (at blk 704) to take the 1.41km bus ride to Boon Lay Bus Interchange/MRT, or walk around 500m to Pioneer MRT station. Likewise, people staying at blk 833-838 would not have to cross the road to take the 1.84km ride on 243G (at blk710) to Boon Lay Bus Interchange/MRT station.</li>
              <li>*For the people staying at blk 833-838, besides not having to cross the road, they can get to the MRT (at Pioneer MRT station) 45.1% faster as the ride there on this bus service is only 1.01km.</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">*Currently, if they do not want to cross the road, the only bus services the people at blk 974-980 have to Boon Lay Bus Interchange and MRT are 241 (around 3.1km to Pioneer MRT, around 4.2km to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and 243W (around 3.1km to Boon Lay Bus Interchange), which is very long. Whereas for the people at blk 833-838, they only have 243W (2.8km) to Boon Lay Bus Interchange</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">*This new feeder bus service would shorten the ride to 1.4km (95.4% faster)(to Pioneer MRT Station) and 2.7km (12.9% faster)(to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) for people staying at blk 974-980, and 2.40km (14.3% faster)(to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) for people staying at blk 833-838.</span></li>
              <li>*This new feeder bus service would provide a bus connection to Pioneer MRT station for people staying at blk 711-718. As compared to the 2.5km ride on bus 242 to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, this bus service would enable them to get to the MRT (Pioneer MRT station) in 0.8km (68% faster) and Boon Lay Bus Interchange in 2.2km (12% faster).</li>
              <li>*Meanwhile, for most people staying at Jurong West Street 62, this new feeder bus service would be a complementary to bus service 243, while be a faster (cheaper) alternative for some of them working at Tuas and Gul Circle areas. </li>

              <p>Hi mr jurong west resident, thanks for interest in your proposed amendment of sbs 242. However the reason given is really not strong enough. By your few sightings of sbs 99 having empty upper decks really do not mean anything. Sbs 99 has high loadings at many sectors, thus requiring DDs. After analysing the situations of jurong west st 64 and Jalan Boon Lay, jurong west st 64 is well connected to Boon Lay. At Jalan Boon Lay stop, having 2 services sbs 99 and sbs 242 to gek Poh area connection is not over excessive. It is reasonable. Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurong west resident, sbs 242 is also needed for residents at jurong west ave 4 blk 676B stop. This bus stop is only frequented by sbs 99 and sbs 242. The flats around there need sbs 242. By skipping this portion of jurong west ave 4 and going by your proposed jurong west st 64, it added slight inconvenience which defeats purpose of a feeder service. Thus your proposal is likely to be rejected. Cheers.</p>

              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">*With this new feeder bus service, people staying at blk
                  974-980 would not have to leave their estate and cross the road to
                  the other bus stop (at blk 704) to take the 1.41km bus ride to Boon
                  Lay Bus Interchange/MRT, or walk around 500m to Pioneer MRT
                  station. Likewise, people staying at blk 833-838 would not have to
                  cross the road to take the 1.84km ride on 243G (at blk710) to Boon
                  Lay Bus Interchange/MRT station.</span></li>
              <li>*For the people staying at blk 833-838, besides not having to
                  cross the road, they can get to the MRT (at Pioneer MRT station)
                  45.1% faster as the ride there on this bus service is only
                  1.01km.</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">*Currently, if they do not
                  want to cross the road, the only bus services the people at blk
                  974-980 have to Boon Lay Bus Interchange and MRT are 241 (around
                  3.1km to Pioneer MRT, around 4.2km to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and
                  243W (around 3.1km to Boon Lay Bus Interchange), which is very
                  long. Whereas for the people at blk 833-838, they only have 243W
                  (2.8km) to Boon Lay Bus Interchange</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">*This new feeder bus service
                  would shorten the ride to 1.4km (95.4% faster)(to Pioneer MRT
                  Station) and 2.7km (12.9% faster)(to Boon Lay Bus Interchange) for
                  people staying at blk 974-980, and 2.40km (14.3% faster)(to Boon
                  Lay Bus Interchange) for people staying at blk 833-838.</span></li>
              <li>*This new feeder bus service would provide a bus connection to
                  Pioneer MRT station for people staying at blk 711-718. As compared
                  to the 2.5km ride on bus 242 to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, this bus
                  service would enable them to get to the MRT (Pioneer MRT station)
                  in 0.8km (68% faster) and Boon Lay Bus Interchange in 2.2km (12%
                  faster).</li>
              <li>*Meanwhile, for most people staying at Jurong West Street 62,
                  this new feeder bus service would be a complementary to bus service
                  243, while be a faster (cheaper) alternative for some of them
                  working at Tuas and Gul Circle areas. </li>

              <p>Honestly, no need for the new feeder service to Pioneer you gave outlined. There is already 185 from ave 5 to pioneer MRT and 192/193 from ave 4 to Pioneer MRT... If you observe there is not much loading towards Pioneer MRT from these avenues.. People prefer to go to Boon Lay instead.</p>
              <p>the feeder service that needs to be introduced is to Jurong West St 93. There is no service for people living along this area. Also need bus to Kim Tian area, International rd... Huge parts of these areas are covered with no bus service.</p>

              <p>I suppose you meant 'Kian Teck', 'Neythal Road' and 'Tractor Road', which have public bus connections only to the perimeters of these areas. </p>
              <p>Actually, there are many other similar areas in Boon Lay/Pioneer Industrial areas and Tuas which require more bus connections to these areas, that would go into the minor roads to serve the people working there. </p>
              <p>The public transport connectivity is not really there. This is perhaps the reason why there is heavy traffic congestion problem during peak hours, since most people commute on private transport (including private buses) and not many people commute on public transport, since it is not really there and it is not really reliable.</p>
              <p>Well, Tuas MRT is coming and Joo Koon Bus Interchange is opening. I would suggest a major overhaul to the bus services network at Tuas and Jurong Industrial areas, probably by breaking up the existing bus services into shorter bus services, so that the buses can ply more roads and serve more people. </p>
