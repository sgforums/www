              <p>Back to 82/107, before NEL introduce, 82 run from Punggol End to Shenton Way... SDs...<br><br>Can upgrade extended 82 to FULL DD service and special 82e plying Punggol/part of SKG before going KPE/Shenton Way area as suggested by a few bros here.<br><br>Correspondence with LTA seem to give me the impression that there is Premium 569 running in the morning, find it puzzling, Punggol residents must pay premium ride and worse only one trip every weekday just to get to town?! It does not hold as most of the housing estates(except Yew Tee, but that is another story) have at least one service to town/CBD area. (please do not ask me to list hor, you all should knoe)<br><br>After that, kena chopped to end at SGN station, if NEL breakdown at Punggol, Punggol residents ho say liao, but wait for MRT shuttle will at least be better than SMRT's dilly dally denial attitude...</p>

              <p>Alternatively, you could suggest this to the Residents' Corner (RC) or to your Member of Parliament. Convince the RC people and/or your MP that your suggestion will improve public bus services and they will submit a proposal to LTA to consider your suggestion.</p>

              <p>If go through MP and/or RC, I think LTA will be more likely to accept and implement your suggestion.</p>
              <p>Of course, I am not sure if this applies to the MPs of Aljunied GRC, Hougang SMC and Punggol East SMC. But even if you stay in Opposition's teritory, you can still try la... after all, PAP wants to win back everything they lose. They are probably more likely to serve the opposition wards, such as introducing new BSEP routes there, to make the people there happy, so that next election they would vote for them. </p>

              <p>My RC members most of them DO NOT take public transport, they join so that they can get their children to schools(if i am not wrong) or have their own vested interests. Furthermore most of them are new Singaporeans...<br><br>My MP is a very busy person, ESM... my Estate is nice on the outside(from afar) not so clean inside(i tink its the same for most lightning bolt controlled estates?)<br><br>Your sentence "If go through MP and/or RC, I think LTA will be more likely to
              accept and implement your suggestion" is very much correct and appropriate coz whenver have new bus routes, newspaper reports the MP/grassroots for that area have worked very hard with LTA to get it implemented...<br><br>SG &gt; cant work if you do not have connections with the ruling elite in one way or another...</p>

              <p>@Acx1688 I think I know why LTA rejected your
              suggestion. </p>
              <p>Simply because the demand for bus services at that area is too
              high, and combining them into 1 single bus service would reduce the
              supply of bus services. </p>
              <p>Some routes are similar because they complement each other, so
              that the load can be spread out.  If combine those routes into
              one single route, the entire load will be on that one route and
              there will be a lot of unnecessary complications regarding crowd
              management.</p>
              <p>More bus services = better ride. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>Alternatively, instead of combining bus services, you could
              suggest to LTA to introduce a new bus route, which duplicates
              sections of these bus services. </p>
              <p>That is probably why the new BSEP bus routes are mostly
              duplicating existing bus services. For instance, BSEP service 49
              duplicates mainly existing service 98.</p>

              <p>I don't think Sv 49 duplicates Sv 98... The purpose of this service is to relieve load on 334 and give people living on st 41 an option of Lakeside MRT rather than go all the way to  Jurong., it also relieves and provides another option to 335.. I don't see it affecting Sv 98 loading one bit.</p>

If 135 is diverted via Haig road, will provide direct connectivity to residents along Haig road to both Parkway Parade and Paya Lebar... You have from Paya Lebar 43/76 with DDs and good frequency to Tanjong Katong, so should not cause inconvenience. You also have sv 40 in case some people will cry that they lose direct connectivity to Pipit/Circuit/Mattar/Aljunied areas... If people from Tanjong Katong want to go to Serangoon, still have 43 to connect... for AMK still have 76... so will not cause inconvenience to people but rather benefit lot of people living along Haig road... if LTA is reading, it should consider this modification for sure.</p>

              <p>while i agree sengkang/punggol need a full day bus svc to town, a new semi-express svc would be better than merging 82/107. with mrt providing a faster journey in most cases, new long bus routes should use the expressway for a faster and more direct connection, as a good alternative to bus/mrt transfer. </p>
              <p>the new city direct svcs are cheaper than existing premium bus rts while providing similar fast connectivity, but would be better if some of them have full day variants serving additional areas like orchard, suntec or even harbourfront</p>

              <p>while i agree sengkang/punggol need a full day bus svc to town,
              a new semi-express svc would be better than merging 82/107. with
              mrt providing a faster journey in most cases, new long bus routes
              should use the expressway for a faster and more direct connection,
              as a good alternative to bus/mrt transfer. </p>
              <p>the new city direct svcs are cheaper than existing premium bus
              rts while providing similar fast connectivity, but would be better
              if some of them have full day variants serving additional areas
              like orchard, suntec or even harbourfront</p>
