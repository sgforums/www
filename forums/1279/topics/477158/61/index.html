              <p>I have labelled the points you have mentioned into two different points in your quote:</p>
              <p>1. Swapping of routes between 700/700A and 960 still retains the route between Whitley/Newton and Bugis, just that it is 700/700A plying that sector...</p>
              <p>2. I disagree that the workers need to spend more fare changing buses. Service 700/700A and 960 called at the same bus stop along Whitley Road after PIE; if they transfer buses at Whitley Road, then the distance from Woodlands Road to Little India remains unchanged. Unless they changed buses at Bukit Panjang, then it is as what you said because 700/700A plied a longer route via Petir Rd and Dairy Farm Rd towards BKE.</p>

              <p>One problem is the loading for 700/A... I don't know if 700/A loading is as crowded as 960, but to have to wait for another service at, say Whitley, means a troublesome transfer if they can't board... Boarding from BPJ wise, I would say for BPJ/CCK/Yew Tee residents will do...</p>
              <p>I think it will be good to have an 'express' full day service, maybe 967 or 968 that skips BPJ but connects Yew Tee...

              <p>TBH, this is one of the few times that gets me curious on this rumoured route 164 (PGL - Tamp) possibly via PSR (rumours also mention route 3)</p>
              <p>But we have to understand that with the opening of the TPE stop, there are a lot of options for PGL pax to head to either one of these places. However, during AM peak, most options are normally not viable. This will mainly discuss mainly services calling at the TPE stop, and best possibly route in order for it not to be known as yet another failed route</p>
              <p>PSR-bound services</p>
              <p>3: Too winding as the route travels around PSR (as a quad-feeder trunk service), but can manage loads well between PGL and PSR</p>
              <p>39: Yes, it will receive DDs soon, capacity will increase, and so will its loadings. Forget it.</p>
              <p>88: Nope, will probably be full</p>
              <p>89: Industrial-bound service, won't touch</p>
              <p>109: Same as 89</p>
              <p>Tamp-bound services</p>
              <p>27: Will definately be full from SKG/Hougang pax</p>
              <p>34: Already serving the PGL-Tamp sector well, as well as unique intratown within Tamp</p>
              <p>168: Probably full from pax from WLD</p>
              <p>969: Same as 39.</p>
              <p>So looking at the above, there are chances that it will just duplicates a number of routes. Most of the above routes are pretty direct, so I will try a different approach.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the via PSR route. The direct-to-Tamp also share the original same sector within PGL</p>
              <p>PGL Int</p>
              <p>PGL Pl, Dr (you can suggest alternative, but plying PGL Dr means Dr pax will not need to xfer buses to get to TPE stop)</p>
              <p>Edgefield Plains, PGL Field, Rd, TPE</p>
              <p>PSR Dr 12,3 (There are no services plying the full stretch currently, also the only other viable alternative is to ply Dr 1, which have 4 full day trunks and a full day Express plying it already. Connects to areas like Elias Mall, DTE, upcoming condos at Dr 3, Masjid Al-istighfar Mosque, Greenview (back gate)/Siglap/Hai Sing Catholic Sec, PSR Pri (back gate), Loyang Pt/Depot)</p>
              <p>From here, we can either choose to go straight to Tamp via Loyang Ave/Tamp Ave 7 (and duplicate a LOT of services). or go via Upp Changi. Lets try the latter.</p>
              <p>Old Tamp Rd, Upp Changi Rd Nth (compliments Svc 4/5/37) PIE, Tamp Ave 5, Tamp Int (It is an equally fast route towards Upp Changi compared to 4/37. Also, you have to take into account that when DTL3 opens, some demand will be shifted to Tamp East MRT. To shift some demand off Tamp Int, hence the express sector.</p>
              <p>Now the direct-to-Tamp</p>
              <p>Tamp Ave 10,1,4,5,Int</p>
              <p>I sometimes took 69 from Tamp Int to TP during AM Peak, and oftern at Ave 5, you will see students transfering from 34 to board 69. WEGs normally get full due to this. Also, the sheer amount of pax changing from 27/34/168 at Ave 5 (Blk 147) and 168 at Ave 1 (SAFRA) to TP-bound services are a lot. Those services (8,15,23) already have heVy loads from Ave 2, PSR and Tamp Int respectively. Also taken into account is that with the completion of DTL3, Tamp West will be the station of choice for most students. Ave 4 will receive MRT entrances, and also, that sector of Ave 4 is served by only 2 services in total. the advantage is that it reduces the xfers from Svc 34 for TP-bound pax, brings TP pax to Ave 4 MRT entrances, enhance Ave 4 service choices (Blk 80x)</p>
              <p>In the future, when the PGL semi-expressway opens, it can ply PGL Dr, semi-expressway, PSR Dr 12 first.</p>
              <p>TL:DR - two service route ideas for upcoming rumoured route 164 that (hopefully) reduce duplication with existing links, while duplicating heavy sectors</p>

              <p>Tamp Ave 10,1,4,5,Int</p>
              <p>I sometimes took 69 from Tamp Int to TP during AM Peak, and
                  oftern at Ave 5, you will see students transfering from 34 to board
                  69. WEGs normally get full due to this. Also, the sheer amount of
                  pax changing from 27/34/168 at Ave 5 (Blk 147) and 168 at Ave 1
                  (SAFRA) to TP-bound services are a lot. Those services (8,15,23)
                  already have heVy loads from Ave 2, PSR and Tamp Int respectively.
                  Also taken into account is that with the completion of DTL3, Tamp
                  West will be the station of choice for most students. Ave 4 will
                  receive MRT entrances, and also, that sector of Ave 4 is served by
                  only 2 services in total. the advantage is that it reduces the
                  xfers from Svc 34 for TP-bound pax, brings TP pax to Ave 4 MRT
                  entrances, enhance Ave 4 service choices (Blk 80x)</p>
              <p>In the future, when the PGL semi-expressway opens, it can ply
                  PGL Dr, semi-expressway, PSR Dr 12 first.</p>
              <p>TL:DR - two service route ideas for upcoming rumoured route 164
                  that (hopefully) reduce duplication with existing links, while
                  duplicating heavy sectors</p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, the new service must not go Pasir ris or else it defeated the purpose of directly connecting Punggol with tampines. Then there will be no purpose to introduce this new service. </p>
              <p>The service should go to Punggol central. In this way, people living in Punggol drive or field can still walk to Punggol central to take this bus service. Let's don't talk about the futuristic Punggol semi-expressway. This new service is for the next few months. This route will not have duplications with existing routes nor duplicate heavy sectors.</p>

              <p>punggol bus interchange</p>
              <p>This route will not duplicate sbs 34. It will not go the traditional Punggol road to TPE and it can avoid the super crowded TPE traffic in morning and evening. It goes by Punggol east to the secluded tampines road then cut into tampines ave 10. It also avoided the pasir ris area. It gives those flats and condos coming up along tampines ave 6 and tampines ave 9 a new service. From Punggol to tampines should be quite a direct 20 to 25 min service. Full journey to and back will be a 50 min journey at most. Much shorter than Sbs 3.</p>

              <p>Like mrwhale mention, that section of Buankok Dr is 1 way only. To maintain that fast connection, only viable method is TPE. Else, you have to go through Hougang. Or the direction towards PGL have to detour via Defu Flyover.</p>
              <p>Your proposed route is unique in some sense, but the sector along Ave 6 is better off plying bi-directional. Tampines is also getting two more interchanges in that area. There will at least be a feeder going there.</p>
              <p>Also, I did propose a route that skips PSR/Upp Changi. But it is more of a school service (TP) that enters Tamp from Ave 10 via Ave 1/4.</p>

              <p>did u see the route I have proposed? It does Punggol west before going to TPE. And for me it should cover Temasek Poly and be another intra-town like 34 within Tampines town covering ave 5, ave 9, ave 6, ave 5, ave 1 before heading back to Punggol. </p>
              <p>The route you have proposed is also good but west Punggol gets completely ignored. East at least has sv 3, 34 to crossover. </p>
              <p>Also within Tampines town, it duplicates sv 27, 168 from TPE.</p>
              <p>Going to Poly will take off load from other services as students will prefer this as another alternative.</p>

                  9, ave 6, ave 5, ave 1 before heading back to Punggol. </p>
              <p>The route you have proposed is also good but west Punggol gets
                  completely ignored. East at least has sv 3, 34 to
                  crossover. </p>
              <p>Also within Tampines town, it duplicates sv 27, 168 from
                  TPE.</p>
              <p>Going to Poly will take off load from other services as students
                  will prefer this as another alternative.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Alternative route within Punggol could be Punggol Way, Sumang Link, Sentul Cres (non-stop) then continue somewhere else.</p>

              <p>Hi. I would like to suggest a new bus route which starts and ends at Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange. This route serves areas in Choa Chu Kang which presently have very limited bus connections, enhances intra-town connectivity across Choa Chu Kang town and connects Choa Chu Kang town to the major developments at Choa Chu Kang Grove. It may be an extension to the new BSEP route 983.</p>
              <p>The route length is 14743.43 metres (14.74 km). This is an approximate value because I have no idea where Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange is located. So plus minus one kilometre, it's up to 15.74 km.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your feedback. Below are my answers</p>
              <p>1. I agree going to TPE would be faster but it would still make sense to do Punggol Field given there are huge number of BTOs operational there with only sv 119. Also it will provide Punggol road connectivity to Punggol West and Field residents. So if someone wants to transfer to sv 3, 82, 83, 136 etc can do so at Punggol road stop, and not everyone has to come to interchange to do so.</p>
              <p>2. I am okay if the bus goes via ave 8.</p>
              <p>3. I would have said go via Tampines Regional Library and ave 9 as it would get a new stop, but yes st 41 will be faster. I am okay with either option actually.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, west Punggol is still not too far from MRT. So they still have sbs 34. Furthermore sbs 34 does not really go to east Punggol that much. 2 stops and almost out of Punggol already. As for sbs 3, needless to say anymore. Such a long winded route! Even go a huge loop around east Punggol also useless as people do not take it to go tampines. So west and east Punggol is about equal. East Punggol also needs a more direct service to tampines(bedok/changi business park if possible). By the way, as of now, east Punggol residents is almost quadruple that of west Punggol. So east Punggol demand is even greater than west Punggol as of feb 2015. Cheers.</p>

              <p>One problem is the loading for 700/A... I don't know if 700/A
                          loading is as crowded as 960, but to have to wait for another
                          service at, say Whitley, means a troublesome transfer if they can't
                          board... Boarding from BPJ wise, I would say for BPJ/CCK/Yew Tee
                          residents will do...</p>
              <p>I think it will be good to have an 'express' full day service,
                          maybe 967 or 968 that skips BPJ but connects Yew Tee... Currently,
                          this is the lack from North side for parallel svc...<br> <br> Maybe route can be like this:<br> WRI<br> Wlands Ave 3<br> BKE<br> KJE<br> Yew Tee<br> KJE<br> BKE<br> PIE<br> Whitley/Stevens<br> Scotts<br> Orchard<br> Raffles<br> Shenton</p>

              <p>My proposed route for new service 968 is from Woodlands to Tampines</p>
              <p>Route:</p>
              <p>Woodlands Reg Int Berth 13 &gt; Outside Civic Centre (follow west loop 912E)&gt; Blk 511 &gt; Jalan Kayu/TPE bus stop (follow 168) then enter Tampines at entrance near Century Square or at Tampines Interchange extention.This service provides direct route for passengers going to Tampines serving mostly express roads so it could also be called 968E.As said in reply below(what I posted originally) this service is known  as 968 as both 168 &amp;969 passes Tampines so I incorporate both '96'&amp;'68' series to form 968/968E.</p>
              <p>And from what I feel 933 should be introduced and maybe SBST can introduce 168A for people travelling from Woodlands to Tampines or 168B forpeople traveling from Tampines to Bedok</p>

              <p>Fleet:Full Enviro 500</p>
              <p>Why 968 and 933 was chosen:</p>
              <p>968 was used as 969 goes to Tampines passing by Yishun and 168
              also passes by Tampines and also Tampines interchane extension
              having the '96' and '68' series service together.</p>
              <p>933 cause if there is 972 passing by Dhouby Ghaut why not have
              933 as well and they are also our local radio stations</p>
