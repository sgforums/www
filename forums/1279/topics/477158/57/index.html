                  <div class="quote_body">
                  <p>Should loop at JE Int.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, there are currently no actual way from Beauty World MRT
                              to Ngee Ann Poly, only from Ngee Ann - Beauty World (52/75/184). We
                              need a service coming from Clementi Rd to loop at there. The place
                              the route originated from will definately duplicate sone current
                              day routes, but here is what I can think of so far.</p>
                  <p>95 (Kent Ridge - Beauty World MRT via Holland Village)</p>
                  <p>Current day route to Holland Village</p>
                  <p>61/75's route to Upp Bukit Timah (Loop point)</p>
                  <p>The closest stop will probably be Bukit Timah Link, where there
                              is only 61, and 75/184 bus stop along Jln Anak Bukit is quite a
                              distance. Having another service to call at that stop will be
                              really useful.</p>
                  </div>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Actually, besides the buses at Clementi MRT Station, the alternative to Ngee Ann Polytechnic is to take 41, 61, 66, 77, 157, 174, 970 or 985, alight at Jalan Jurong Kechil, walk through the HDB estate, cross the bridge and walk through the sports centre (blk 18), and vice-versa. However, there is traffic congestion problem at Bukit Batok. That's why in my suggestion, I recommend that the route takes the expressway to Jurong East. </p>
                  <p>The other alternative is to take 74 from Dover MRT Station, which also stops at the bus stop along Clementi Road.</p>
                  <p>When Downtown Line 2 opens, there is 151, 154 and 74 at King Albert Park station (DT6) to Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
                  <p>From Beauty World station (DT5), there is 184 at Upper Bukit Timah Road (towards Woodlands) and 61 at Jalan Jurong Kechil (both directions).</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, I feel that the location of Beauty World station is out of place. They should have sited it along Jalan Anak Bukit instead. Or maybe they should re-design the junction at Upper Bukit Timah Road, Jalan Anak Bukit and Hindhede Road, and re-route bus routes to ply the section of Upper Bukit Timah Road where Beauty World station is located.</p>
                  <p>Well, at least there is King Albert Park station along Downtown Line 2 which has three services (74, 151, 154) connecting it to Ngee Ann Polytechnic. This is comparable to Clementi station along East West Line which also has three services (52, 154 and 184) to Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps LTA can consider re-locating bus stop #42051 (The Sterling) to a King Albert Park station exit when Downtown Line 2 opens. The current location of bus stop #42051 is around 100-150m away from the station.</p>
                  <p>But then again, the Downtown Line does not connect to many HDB areas in the West (except Bukit Panjang). Only East side HDB people will really benefit from Downtown Line, which I think should be enough to significantly improve the loading on East West Line and the crowding at Clementi MRT Station bus stop.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I feel that there should be a new bus route connecting Ngee Ann Polytechnic <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span></strong> (without transfers or beyond 30 minutes of travel) to Jurong West or Bukit Gombak.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, Clementi Road is already used at its maximum capacity and there is always jam during peak hours. LTA may be reluctant to have new routes there, because of the traffic congestion problem. Obviously, the reason is because there is only Clementi Road, that's why Clementi Road is always jam during peak hours. LTA should build a new road that runs parallel to Clementi Road. #justsaying</p>
                  <p>Just wondering, is it possible to have a public bus route that originates from somewhere outside Clementi and goes into Ngee Ann Polytechnic campus and loops inside there?</p>
                  <p>As in, from Clementi Road,</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- blk 72</span></li>

                  <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- exit to Clementi Road</span></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Should be possible. Since right now there are already (shuttle) buses running in the campus. If this is allowed, we do not have to have a new bus route that runs along Clementi Road and duplicate existing services.</p>

              <p>Actually, besides the buses at Clementi MRT Station, the
              alternative to Ngee Ann Polytechnic is to take 41, 61, 66, 77, 157,
              174, 970 or 985, alight at Jalan Jurong Kechil, walk through the
              HDB estate, cross the bridge and walk through the sports centre
              (blk 18), and vice-versa. However, there is traffic congestion
              problem at Bukit Batok. That's why in my suggestion, I recommend
              that the route takes the expressway to Jurong East. </p>
              <p>The other alternative is to take 74 from Dover MRT Station,
              which also stops at the bus stop along Clementi Road.</p>
              <p>When Downtown Line 2 opens, there is 151, 154 and 74 at King
              Albert Park station (DT6) to Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>From Beauty World station (DT5), there is 184 at Upper Bukit
              Timah Road (towards Woodlands) and 61 at Jalan Jurong Kechil (both
              directions).</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I feel that the location of Beauty World station
              is out of place. They should have sited it along Jalan Anak Bukit
              instead. Or maybe they should re-design the junction at Upper Bukit
              Timah Road, Jalan Anak Bukit and Hindhede Road, and re-route bus
              routes to ply the section of Upper Bukit Timah Road where Beauty
              World station is located.</p>
              <p>Well, at least there is King Albert Park station along Downtown
              Line 2 which has three services (74, 151, 154) connecting it to
              Ngee Ann Polytechnic. This is comparable to Clementi station along
              East West Line which also has three services (52, 154 and 184) to
              Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
              <p>Perhaps LTA can consider re-locating bus stop #42051 (The
              Sterling) to a King Albert Park station exit when Downtown Line 2
              opens. The current location of bus stop #42051 is around 100-150m
              away from the station.</p>
              <p>But then again, the Downtown Line does not connect to many HDB
              areas in the West (except Bukit Panjang). Only East side HDB people
              will really benefit from Downtown Line, which I think should be
              enough to significantly improve the loading on East West Line and
              the crowding at Clementi MRT Station bus stop.</p>
              <p>Thus, I feel that there should be a new bus route connecting
              Ngee Ann Polytechnic <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">directly</span></strong> (without
              transfers or beyond 30 minutes of travel) to Jurong West or Bukit
              Gombak.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Clementi Road is already used at its maximum
              capacity and there is always jam during peak hours. LTA may be
              reluctant to have new routes there, because of the traffic
              congestion problem. Obviously, the reason is because there is only
              Clementi Road, that's why Clementi Road is always jam during peak
              hours. LTA should build a new road that runs parallel to Clementi
              Road. #justsaying</p>
              <p>Just wondering, is it possible to have a public bus route that
              originates from somewhere outside Clementi and goes into Ngee Ann
              Polytechnic campus and loops inside there?</p>
              <p>As in, from Clementi Road,</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- blk 53</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- blk 72</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- blk 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- exit to Clementi
              Road</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Should be possible. Since right now there are already (shuttle)
              buses running in the campus. If this is allowed, we do not have to
              have a new bus route that runs along Clementi Road and duplicate
              existing services.</p>

              <p>Once DTL2 opens, there will be shift in loading.. many long distance travelers will change to MRT... and we will see short distance travelers from King Albert MRT to Ngee Ann... I also see Clementi MRT bound services getting relieved because of this.</p>
              <p>I feel that is one of the reasons sv 41 route has not been designed to go to Ngee Ann coz LTA believe after DTL2 opens... there will definitely be reduction in bus load for Ngee Ann. </p>

              <p>At Taman Jurong, there are new HDB flats being constructed now, and many more will be constructed in future. At present, the roads with the new HDB flats are:</p>

              <div>Likewise in Boon Lay, where there are new HDB flats at Boon Lay Avenue and Boon Lay Drive.</div>

              <div>There will be more new HDB flats in future, at the empty lands

              <div><br></div>
              <div>Considering how much the population at Taman Jurong will
              increase, it may be wise to create another feeder bus which
              complements 240 to serve the increase in population in Taman
              Jurong. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Likewise in Boon Lay, where there are new HDB flats at Boon
              Lay Avenue and Boon Lay Drive.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>In my opinion, I feel that the Taman Jurong section of 240 can
              be replaced with a bi-directional feeder route.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Was drawing routes here and there, then I realise 98 and 49
              serve better than 240 at Corporation Road, and the new route seems
              to duplicate 240... Bingo! </div>

              <div>Meanwhile, 240 can be re-routed to loop around Jurong

              <p>JWR: May be from the map you have drawn, you will realize how complicated your route is. sv 49, 98, 154, 240 are serving residents needs very well in this area. And where do you see more land in Taman Jurong? With last BTO announcement, all land in Taman Jurong will be taken. Yung Ho Springs, Lake Vista and Yuang Kuang Court are the last of HDBs within Taman Jurong.</p>
              <p>Unless you mean... they will build HDBs at Golf Course or Jurong Lake Park. I don't see this happening. </p>
              <p>Also you need to note that 240 serves an important feeder connection between Lakeside and Corporation Place/Kartworld commercial complexes on AYE, where it loops. Your service will not provide this link.</p>

              <p>Every bus goes full... and there are huge # of commuters who also board bus apart from interchange... why would you want ppl to pay trunk fares for a feeder? Anyway, no change will happen to 334... LTA will not inconvenience few ppl on routes not doing well.. you really think they will make any change to a service that goes housefull on almost every trip in peak hour.. I don't think so... And why change 334 when you can do the same thing by changing sv 49? </p>

              with distance-based fare nowadays and the assumption that most pax will make transfers after taking the feeder bus, there's no need change feeder bus fares to trunk fares. and there's a fare cap for feeder buses to compensate if the route is more winding in order to pick up more pax and ensure the route is economical enough to operate.

              <p>If there is any route in Jurong East area that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not well planned: it is <strong>sv 333</strong></span></p>

              <p>For st 32 residents, hardly see many ppl boarding sv 333, instead walk to JE Ave 1 and take 99/334 to MRT.</p>
              <p>For JE Ave 1 residents, clearly everyone prefers sv 98 to JE except those who want to go to IMM board sv 333</p>
              <p>For Toh Guan Rd residents, they prefer sv 52/105/183 to JE except those who want to go to say Townhall rd to transfer (miniscule #)</p>
              <p>For IMM, sv 333 was the preferred option until sv 990 was introduced. I think still at JE Interchange, people prefer sv 333 as it starts from there rather than take 990 outside interchange.</p>

              <p>51 needs to be cut short from Hougang Int to New Bridge Road also. There are many bus svcs from Jurong/Boon Lay to Harbourfront.</p>
