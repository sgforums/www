              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I am not dumb. There is still scope for 2 more bus services. See the planning of punggol town and you will realize that there are many other roads inside punggol not covered by even 1 basic service. This goes to show that there is definitely going to be additional bus services. They must originate from the nearest interchange which is punggol. Currently there are still empty berths which are used for emergency or back-up bus berth for LRT breakdown in punggol bus interchange. For your info, punggol does not have many new services from BSEP. Sbs 119 and sbs 50 are the only 2 new services. We all know sbs 119 is not really a new service as it is extended northwards from sengkang to punggol to serve the new HDB estates in punggol field to the west of the mrt.</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, before Punggol North MRT Stn is completed, 84 will still be retained as a feeder for Punggol North. It should be either withdrawn or retained (if they still decide to keep 84) when the MRT extension is completed...

              <p>See the planning of punggol town and you will realize
              that there are many other roads inside punggol not covered by even
              1 basic service. This goes to show that there is definitely going
              to be additional bus services. <strong>They must originate from the nearest
              interchange which is punggol.</strong> Currently there are still empty
              berths which are used for emergency or back-up bus berth for LRT
              breakdown in punggol bus interchange. For your info, punggol does
              not have many new services from BSEP. Sbs 119 and sbs 50 are the
              only 2 new services. We all know sbs 119 is not really a new
              service as it is extended northwards from sengkang to punggol to
              serve the new HDB estates in punggol field to the west of the

              <p>Such far away looping point?? Then situation like 27 and then
                  you will again crib about bunching. Not noticed hazards of long
                  looping point from Sv 27 already?</p>

              <p>27. </p>
              <p>Is due to over spam of buses and improper monitor of bus schedule, dear mister. </p>
              <p>Svcs like 34, 36 and 858 have no (or seldom) problem with bunching leh?</p>
              <p>Or what you can do is shift all (if not most coz of 84) the short range svc eg. 83 to terminate at its current looping point? And let long range terminate at int instead?</p>

              <p>Please explain how is Punggol heavily spammed with BSEP. Also,
              Punggol Int has still lot of scope to take in new services, which
              will rightly be reserved and launched once Punggol north is
              developed.</p>

              <p>Okay to dupdup77 and you, I'm sorry for the definition. But Punggol has alr gotten plenty of service improvement alr and don't you think it should slow down a bit? After all, the Punggol flats are not even fully developed and the bus int currently is just temporary. Once it fully develops and the new int opens (provided there are plans on it) you can have all the new svcs you want. Okay, not that I think Punggol don't deserve new svcs, but just that the time is not right. That's what I've got to say now. </p>
