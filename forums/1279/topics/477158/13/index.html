              <p>AM peak jam is due to lane closed for bus stop erection. Purpose of bus stop is definitely to allow buses going by this route to stop. Not for selective choosing of bus services. Buses going by whole stretch of TPE (39, 168, 858, 969) most likely will stop there. Buses turning out from punggol and sengkang are unlikely to stop there. We shall know the answers in a few months time. Cheers</p>

              <p>I feel that LTA will not approve such a route because as of this moment, there are already 2 bus services (sbs 159, sbs 163) with the same starting and same terminating interchange and so they are unlikely to allow a third service with identical interchanges being sengkang and toa payoh. I have seen the above route and it is a good one. But too bad 3 services with exactly same starting and same ending interchanges have never happened before. Maybe you will like to fine-tune the above route with a different terminating interchange?</p>

              <p>There is actually only 1 group of 3 (8, 28, 31) which is valid. Cheers. 7, 14, 196 (this group of 3) were not planned to be so initially. 7 and 14 were actually the only ones and 196 was unfortunately temporarily extended to the nearest interchange (bedok) because marine parade terminal stopped to exist. Up until now, I am still waiting for sbs 196 to be amended but it seems not to be so. As for the group of 3 (18, 38, 69), this is not valid as sbs 18 and sbs 69 are looping services and did not terminate at the interchange. </p>

              <p>3 routes with same terminating points doesn't mean the routes are the same. In fact 38 doesn't meet 69 at all after leaving Tampines/Bedok Int. </p>
              <p>Eh please lah, this is SG rmb. Most routes are not designed so that a person can travel from int to city/another int, but rather short sectors and sectors within. That's how the svc 8 clan and svc 14 clan managed to survive. </p>
              <p>But to BusAnalayzer, I would recommend the route to be extended to Punggol, plying the new and to-be estates 119 is currently plying. At the same time shorten 119 back to Sengkang and cut off its share of DDs. But again unlikely thanks to the stupid BSEP. </p>

              Tampines/Bedok Int. </p>
              <p>Eh please lah, this is SG rmb. Most routes are not designed so
              that a person can travel from int to city/another int, but rather
              short sectors and sectors within. That's how the svc 8 clan and svc
              14 clan managed to survive. </p>
              <p>But to BusAnalayzer, I would recommend the route to be extended
              to Punggol, plying the new and to-be estates 119 is currently
              plying. At the same time shorten 119 back to Sengkang and cut off
              its share of DDs. But again unlikely thanks to the stupid
              BSEP. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, there is nothing wrong with that. Yes it is better than cramming with another heavily congested interchange. Of course I know 3 routes with 3 same terminating points do not need to have same routes. For your info, sbs 38 and sbs 69 do not fit into this equation as they are not under same group of same interchanges since sbs 69 is a loop service. So it does not terminate there. Of course I know this is Singapore so people don't travel from interchange to interchange. All I say it is unlikely LTA will plan routes with same terminating interchanges for 3 services. By virtue of your last statement to BusAnalayzer, this shows the route can be further fine-tuned. This goes to show to all that the route can be slightly tweaked to serve residents better.</p>

              <p>True. 119 loading is very poor from punggol to sengkang portion. Sbs 50 loading from punggol to sengkang is far much better. Mainly due to improved loading from punggol east and sengkang east area bringing people to sengkang mrt. Cheers.</p>

              <p>28 is not a good example. The route is pretty straightforward from  Tampines CC to TPY. If you are referring to 28 going st 41, 45 etc, then also I don't see issue because there are so many HdB houses there that people need connection to Tampines CC, Safra, Bedok etc. 28 loading also super high coming from these streets. No wonder it got 2 DD slot upgrade few months back.</p>

              <p>28 is not a good example. The route is pretty straightforward
              from Tampines CC to TPY. If you are referring to 28 going st 41, 45
              etc, then also I don't see issue because there are so many HdB
              houses there that people need connection to Tampines CC, Safra,
              Bedok etc. 28 loading also super high coming from these streets. No
              wonder it got 2 DD slot upgrade few months back.</p>

              through SBST area anyway. So over here SMRT will be violating the

              <p>Of the bus that is coming to Bedok it can make sense. Just run it under SMRT in case of MRT breakdown. Or maybe can try SBST.</p>

              <p>You seem like a master at route planning, is it?</p>
              <p>I don't see anything wrong with sv 28's route. If you would be living along one of those Tampines streets, you would know. It connects so many HDB hubs within Tampines East, along st 41, 45, ave 9 to Tampines CC. Otherwise people would have to change. If these people have to go to SAFRA, they take 28, have to go to Bedok they take 28. Do you even know how packed this bus is from these streets. I don't care if it is direct or not, it benefits a lot of people.</p>
              <p>28 is not meant for people to take from Tampines to Toa Payoh. They can choose other options. It is meant to connect Bedok to Tampines internal town and from Bedok to Paya Lebar industrial belt.</p>

              <p>There's a difference between cribbling, and words that make sense. </p>
              <p>And by referring to how efficient buses run in other countries I acknowledge mine as not the former, but more of the latter (though not completely, I admit)</p>
              <p>It's rather astonishing and amazing how you can use 159 to shoot me back. Try again bro. </p>
              <p>Well never once did I say 159 is straightforward; it is just the most straightforward of them all. </p>
              <p>And since even a little bit of transfer annoys you dear sir I can infer that the total 10 min walk transfer at Bishan and Serangoon will suck your soul away. </p>
              <p>163 isn't helping either. </p>
              <p>This is a perfect example of Singapore's screwed up transportation system. MRT? Frequency screwed up. Bus? Route screwed up. Taxi? Fleet and drivers screwed up. Car? COE, ERP screwed up. So we walk lah uh? I don't think you can leh, walk a few stops off and on the bus and waste less than 5 mins of your time will kill u liddat, then walk from Sengkang to TPY is like walking to the moon alr?</p>
              <p>I don't think Singaporeans will be amused too. </p>
