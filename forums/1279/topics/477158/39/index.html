              <p>Hi mr TPS Timothy Mok, I think this will not happen. Irregardless of geylang lor 1 bus terminal closure or not, sbs 62 will stay its current route. Reason is very simple. It is a looping route and does not stop at the lor 1 geylang terminal. So totally not related. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Well I think your extension is a STUPID idea. sv 62 does not terminate at Lor 1 and the extension is more unlikely than 82/107 merger. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Yes route like this on weekends/PH will be good. I was also thinking on similar lines. Just your return route is quite winding and can be made more simple.</p>
              <p>I would say operating timings should match opening/closing timings of Gardens by Bay and maybe extend to Marina Cruise Terminal (like 402 for weekends/PH)</p>

              <p>Yes route like this on weekends/PH will be good. I was also

              <p>But this is only weekend/PH... I expect that on some NBR services.. the frequency/# buses is lower... so can manage.</p>
              <p>Problem now is if you have to start route within CBD, no alternative apart from NBR, Shenton Way or Marina Center. The other two are too commercial for gardens of bay.</p>

              <p>Hi. I would like to make a request to seriously consider revamping service 179, especially during morning peak hours between 6:30am to 8:30am. Today I was at the bus stop waiting for 179 to come, but after so so long, there is still no bus. No 179 bus, but there was one relatively empty 179A bus driving past the bus stop. In the end, as I was in a rush for time, I had to spend $5.70 on a taxi ride to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- No 179A. Just run 179 and 179B.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- 179 run at usual frequency serving all stops along the route.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- 179B service run at feeder bus frequency serving only stops along Pioneer Road North - between Pioneer MRT Station and Blk948-840.</span></li>
              </ol><p></p>
              <p>I know only a handful (or even none) of you here has access to the traffic data on 179 or really know how the traffic is like on 179, so please don't say things like "179 is already serving you all quite well" if you don't really know how it is like actually. </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I hope someone can ask LTA to consider having a new Short Working Trip between Pioneer MRT Station and Blk948-840. Just one that runs only during morning peak hours from Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays. That's all I am asking for.</p>

              <p>If sbst275 would be still around, he would have beaten you to death for your suggestion. You dont know how many topics he started in the last 3 years just to speak about how 179A should get more buses etc. etc. </p>
              <p>On another note, it might have been special case today, normally 179 buses are there every 03-04 minutes. Must have been some massive jam.</p>

              revamping service 179, especially during morning peak hours between
              6:30am to 8:30am. Today I was at the bus stop waiting for 179 to
              come, but after so so long, there is still no bus. No 179 bus, but
              there was one relatively empty 179A bus driving past the bus stop.
              In the end, as I was in a rush for time, I had to spend $5.70 on a
              taxi ride to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- No 179A. Just run 179 and
              179B.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">- 179 run at usual frequency

              <p>I know only a handful (or even none) of you here has access to
              the traffic data on 179 or really know how the traffic is like on
              179, so please don't say things like "179 is already serving you
              all quite well" if you don't really know how it is like
              actually. </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, I hope someone can ask LTA to consider having a new
              Short Working Trip between Pioneer MRT Station and Blk948-840. Just
              one that runs only during morning peak hours from Monday to Friday,
              excluding public holidays. That's all I am asking for.</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, what you have seen/witnessed/experienced may be a 1-off incident which do not necessitate any reason to have any additional improvement for this bus service 179. At frequency of 2-8, 1-7, 5-7, 4-10 min depending on timing, sbs 179 has one of the best frequencies in Singapore public transport system. Please gather more data everyday for 1 consecutive months before suggesting such items. Or else if everybody who has experienced 1 time lag and ask for improvement, then the whole system may collapse. Where do you get so many bus drivers and buses? Cheers.</p>
