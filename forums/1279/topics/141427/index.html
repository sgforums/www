I think that on sunday 119 should start operating on 0530 and not 0600 as the at Serangoon Jc that side the first bus would reached there at around 0635( which set of on 0600)and also Sv 136 and the first bus for 80 is around 0640 then how about before 0630 if you want to get to Senkabg Int or your school in the area where 119 and 136 serves must changed bus which is to take to Hougang Int then take whatever service from there. So hope that on sunday the time can be earlier but put a longer frequency can already</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today very angry with the service waited for 20 mins for a bus to come at Punggol Rd that side and Kovan Hub that side too. At night it is difficult to wait for the bus but other service also like that. Hope they can improve the frequency to about 10-15mins for non-peak??? and 8-10 mins for peak hours.</div>

Sv 113 the waiting time is good during the day and peak hours especially waiting time about 5 mins and can see two buses together. 113 during peak hours will specialy deploy bus at Kovan MRT to bring those people back home at their Lor Ah Soo that area so it is good. While 112 waiting time is so long just like 119 sometimes two same services come already then that service come. They should do the same like 113 by deploying bus at Kovan MRT as more people take from there to go home.</div>
