                  <p><em>20 routes to benefit from tomorrow; 120 more train trips weekly on NEL too</em></p>
                  <p>Can't squeeze into that bus or train during the morning rush hour?</p>
                  <p>Some commuters will get a reprieve tomorrow when 20 heavily used bus routes get more frequent services and bigger buses during peak hours.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the North-East MRT Line will see 120 more train trips a week from tomorrow.</p>
                  <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim announced this yesterday when he visited the Distance Fares roadshow at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
                  <p>These moves come hot on the heels of the recent Budget debate during which he said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will work with transport operators to improve capacity on busy bus services.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday, Mr Lim said he shared commuters' concern that the public transport system was getting more crowded, and resolving this was 'one of our top priorities'.</p>
                  <p>The operators are 'aggressively increasing' transport capacity for bus and rail, he added.</p>
                  <p>For example, over the last year, LTA has added 18 stations and close to 21km to the rail system when it opened the Boon Lay Extension and the Circle Line from Dhoby Ghaut to Marymount.</p>
                  <p>Of the 20 bus routes that will be enhanced, half are run by SBS Transit and the other half by SMRT.</p>
                  <p>SBS Transit will add 24 bus trips a day from Mondays to Fridays and use double-decker buses instead of single-decked ones for services 9, 27, 45, 53, 131, 145, 163, 166, 183 and 198.</p>
                  <p>A double-decker bus can pack in 130 people - 40 more than a single-decked bus.</p>
                  <p>SMRT will add 47 bus trips daily and deploy more bendy buses for its heavily used services 67, 75, 180, 184, 187, 188, 190, 858, 911 and 960.</p>
                  <p>It has also bought nine new buses to service these heavily used routes, said Ms Kang Huey Ling, vice-president of SMRT Buses.</p>
                  <p>Bendy buses can take in 125 passengers - 40 more than a normal bus.</p>
                  <p>These measures will kick in only during what the operators term 'peak of peak' hours. They define this as a half-hour duration any time between 7am and 9am, and between 5.30pm and 7.30pm. 'Peak of peak' hours vary depending on the routes.</p>
                  <p>The additional bus services may not run the full journey.</p>
                  <p>Take service 45, which runs from its Upper East Coast terminal to Ang Mo Kio depot. During 'peak of peak' hours, additional trips will run only from Lorong Ah Soo to the Serangoon MRT station, said an SBS Transit spokesman.</p>
                  <p>At the Distance Fares roadshow, Mr Lim also urged the public to use an online fare calculator (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.publictransport.sg/distancefare">http://www.publictransport.sg/distancefare</a> ) put up by the LTA to learn more about the new fare system that will kick in on Saturday.</p>
                  <p>Commuters will pay fares based on how far they travel by bus, MRT and LRT - regardless of how many transfers they make - as long as these are kept to a maximum of five transfers.</p>
                  <p>They will no longer pay a boarding charge - also known as a transfer penalty - each time they make a transfer.</p>
                  <p>The move to the new 'distance-based' system is aimed at making fares fairer.</p>
                  <p>At present, commuters who transfer, say, from a bus to a train, may pay a higher total fare even though they may travel a shorter distance than someone who takes a bus that travels a longer distance.</p>
                  <p>Two-thirds of commuters will save 48 cents on average each week, based on data compiled by the Public Transport Council (PTC). One-third of commuters will see a 31-cent weekly fare increase on average.</p>
                  <p>PTC's chairman Gerard Ee had explained that commuters who end up paying more will mostly be those covering a long journey.</p>

                  <p>27 and 53 cannot get DDs &amp; 858 cannot get bendy is because
                  of the height limit restriction in Changi Airport (for DDs) and the
                  turning constraints when entering the Changi Airport PTB bus stops
                  (for bendy).<br> <br> I think the Sunday Times report gets flawed at times.,. The 9 new
                  buses from SMRT might be referring to the 7 OCs to WLDEP, a Yutong
                  bus and a Citaro bus. Sometimes it may lead to confusion that some
                  of them thought that SMRT had bought 9 new bendys when its actually
                  not a true statement</p>

                  <p>Best yet, maybe they misinterpreted it when what SPH meant was, they're adding an aggregate of 9 buses to the bus services earmarked... i'm guessing fleet addition of a bus each to 67, 75, 180, 184, 187, 190, 858, 911 and 960, and running 188A with the same fleet count on Service 188 to improve trips count at the CCK to CCK Way sector.</p>

              <p>I seriously think their shorthand notes in conducting interviews that caused them to write information that are partially correct, or partially incorrect.</p>
              <p>We as enthusiasts know the facts and know what's incorrect in the article. The public if they have common sense will know. But for some it may not be the case.</p>
              <p>Take for example some 183 regular complains to sbst - the news said u are getting double deckers for this route but 2 weeks already i have yet to see a double decker on this route. all i see are all fully packed single decks. pls enlighten</p>
              <p>Then 3 weeks later they reply - due to tight turns and height restrictions we cannot let dds ply 183. however you may be pleased to know that we have added 5 trips operated by a single deck during am and pm peak hours to provide extra capacity for commuters on 183. thank you for your feedback.</p>

              <p>there is only one fleet addition to Sv27. no DD for Sv27/27A... They dun dare to deploy DD on Sv27A, just in case the BC forget that he is driving 27A and drove straight to Changi Airport..  They should  have introduce Sv127 instead, to ply between Hougang and Tampines and use DD on this route.</p>
