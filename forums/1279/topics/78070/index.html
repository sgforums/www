Acceleration wise ZF come out top. On the other hand, Voiths excel in top end speed as they have an overdrive which kicks in at about 70 km/h. All automatic gearboxes have torque converters, ZF'z are more audible than Voiths. Torque converters prevent the engine from stalling when the vehicle is stationary. It also provides a bit of extra power during acceleration. The whistling noise under braking is made by the integrated retarder. The retarder creates a magnetic field around the engine, slowing down its revolution and helps the vehicle to stop.<br><br>All engines have an optimal working range. Gearboxes are essential so that the engine is always operating within this range. For example, let's say an engine works best at  around 1500 rpm.  When moving off, you'll need to select a gear that will provide enough torque to move the vehicle at 1500rpm. Of course, more torque equals less speed. Hence, you'll need to select another gear which will make the vehicle go faster at 1500rpm. In this way, the engine will not be under or over utilised,  prolonging its life.</div>

If you do, you'll end up getting 5-speed instead of 4. At a certain rpm, the torque converter will kick in and you'll hear a rise in pitch. After that you'll hear the pitch drop; that is when the bus engages second gear.</div>

The ZFs are 4-speed gearbox, therefore you could hear 4 distinctive change of gearbox. However one has to beware about the slip gear change, ie the high pitch yell in the beginning, to the lower yell of the next gear change.<br><br>The Habit with Voith gearbox, do have distinct whistle, that is produced when decelerating. Most of the O.405G Habit with Voith gearbox are of 3-speed gearbox. However, the newer Habits, like TIB 1244 - TIB 1247, might have a 4 speed Voith, but no whistle produced during the deceleration of the vehicle. However, one can notice the Voiths by hearing the rather 'dry' engine sound.<br><br>2. Volvo Super Olympians &amp; Tridents<br>Both of these double deckers from SBST do hold up the first gear very long. This is because they are equipped with Voith gearbox. In the Tridents, you can hear the whistle when they are decelerating.

            <div class='col-md body'>The TIBS (now SMRT Buses) have 5 speed ZFs...a  5HP 500.  Because they are governed to 60km/h, as just about all Singaporean heavy and goods vehicles are, they don't ever go into 5th gear.  The only gearboxes that go into top gear are the 4 speed Voiths in the O.405Gs, and the Mk III B10Ms with 3 speed Voiths, and O.405s with SBST which have a 3 speed Mercedes Benz W3E.110 gearbox.  The B10Ms with 4 speed Voiths only go to 3rd, and the Scania N113s when they had a 4 speed Scania gearbox went into 3rd after governing.  It was after the governing thast the problems with the Scania gearbox really became costly, and hence the whole fleet was converted to the Voith gearbox, hence this loud whooosh you get in these buses.  With the Scania gearboxes, you could not hear a thing, other than road noise, and the sound from the a/c or forced ventilation in the non-a/c N113CRBs.</div>
