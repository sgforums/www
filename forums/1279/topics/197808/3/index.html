A more effective deterrent may be to peg some element of failure to meet service standards to the formula for fares adjustment.<br><br>For example, service lapses could equate to a slight drop in the 50 per cent of wage increase and inflation in the fares adjustment formula, or a reduction in the maximum 1.7-per-cent fare increase allowed.<br><br>The rising profits of the transport operators should also be taken into account.<br><br>With the recent increase in taxi fares, more people may take buses and the MRT. The revenue and profits of transport operators may rise further.<br><br>So, I suggest that time be given to assess the impact of the taxi fare increase, before the Public Transport Council (PTC) makes a decision on the fare increase application.<br><br>The main reason given for the fare increases is the rising costs of diesel fuel.<br><br>Why not consider reducing the tax on diesel? The fact that the cost price of ultra-low-sulphur diesel has fallen substantially since April should also be considered.<br><br>The fare adjustment formula is pegged to the change in average wages and inflation. I suggest that adjustments be considered to take into account the declining wages and relatively higher inflation of the lower-income group, which has little choice but to take public transport.<br><br>Instead of taking the CPI and wage increase of the entire population, more weightage should be given to reflect the CPI and wage change of those who have to use public transport.<br><br>In the final analysis, perhaps, the ultimate measure of whether the fare adjustment formula is fair is whether transport operators' profits continue to rise.<br><br>The formula enables operators to keep increasing fares and profits because rarely has there ever been a year when both average wages and inflation have declined.<br><br><strong>Public transport operators have things their way</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Letter from Lai Yew Chan</span><br><br>The proposed hikes have set me wondering whether the present business model of public transport is the best for us.<br><br>For one thing, the vagaries of the market are virtually non-existent for the public transport operators in the present model. This is most evident in the fact that commuters have no alternative but to absorb any fare increase thrust upon them.<br><br>Moreover, variations faced by typical businesses are kept minimal by formulaic price setting and barriers of entry.<br><br>In addition, the market dynamics for alternative modes of transport such as taxis and cars are well regulated and correspondingly predictable Â— a natural advantage to the public transport operators.<br><br>Even service standards are set and audited for compliance by an external regulator, a privilege not ubiquitous among mainstream businesses.<br><br>Would such a paternalistic and deterministic model make our public transport operators competitive? Could modified versions that would serve us better?<br><br>Perhaps the PTC could enlighten commuters like me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Article from <strong><span style="color: red;">TODAY</span></strong> Voices, 3 Aug 2006.<br><br><strong><span style="color: orange;">For a cleaner, spacious ride</span></strong><br>Commuters make known their choices<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Yvonne Lim<br>Voices &amp; Commentary editor</span><br><br>AS the Public Transport Council (PTC) turned up the heat on SMRT and SBS Transit to meet defined service standards ("Getting buses shipshape", July 27), ahead of the impending fare hikes, commuters got down to dirty business.<br><br>That is to say, a fair number of readers asked for public transport operators to be taken to task also for the state of cleanliness on their buses.<br><br>As Diana Tan, who wrote in to agree with letter writer Graham McEune ("Flag down those bus bugbears", July 29), put it: "<span style="color: red;">Dirty floors and windows that look like they have never been cleaned Â— I don't know what tourists think, especially when the rest of Singapore is so clean. As any housewife will tell you, a mop, a bucket and a wet cloth are all you need. Could someone tell SBS this?</span>"<br><br>To be fair, the transport operator's efforts do go further than this. Referring to its previous response to similar complaints, See Leong Kit noted: "SBS Transit's reply, that buses are given a thorough cleaning and fumigation once a month, with the bus drivers doing a quick sweep daily with broom and dustpan, is unacceptable."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Harking back to perennial complaints about stuffy air-conditioning, mouldy air-con vents, cockroaches and mosquitoes, he asked if such "sloppy attention" to public hygiene could have contributed to the seasonal flu outbreak.</span>.<br><br>See suggested the PTC impose standards on maintenance and hygiene. "After the buses stop operating, bring in cleaning contractors with heavy-duty vacuum cleaners to thoroughly clean the buses daily. <span style="color: red;">Areas where many hands have touched, such as grab poles and pull handles, should be wiped with disinfectant</span>."<br><br>Other common bugbears included the advertisements pasted over bus windows and inadequate leg space.<br><br>Raymund Koh, for instance, complained to SMRT that he felt "particularly squeezed in the seat just behind the first exit door" of a "bendy bus".<br><br>He received <span style="color: red;">the response that seats were fitted by the manufacturer based on the regulated 23cm of space.<br><br>"People of the current generation are generally much taller. Our public buses have very little leg room between seats, which tall passengers like myself cannot squeeze into</span> on long journeys. We need to sit slanting," he said.<br><br>Soh Poh Huat was glad the PTC was "finally" proposing to lay down the law on bus frequencies and waiting times, among other things. But he wondered <span style="color: red;">when it would extend the service standards to "buses not stopping close to bus bays to facilitate boarding/alighting", and "bus captains who fail to ensure the elderly, expectant mothers or parents carrying children are seated prior to driving off</span>".<br><br>His suggestion: That PTC set up an automated system to which commuters can instantly SMS their feedback. The authorities could then generate monthly reports. "For example, if there are more than X number of complaints, fines can be imposed," he wrote.<br><br>Going down a somewhat tangential road, Seah Leong Khai wonders if the PTC can extend its purview to commuter behaviour as well.<br><br>"<span style="color: red;">We hear complaints about passengers not giving up their seats to those who need it. Why should we, full fare-paying adults, be made to stand, while able-bodied young people on concessionary fares sit to enjoy the ride?</span>"<br><br>What he wants: For PTC to make it compulsory for students and national servicemen to give up their seats to senior citizens, pregnant women and other adults when the bus is full. Inspectors could enforce this.<br><br>"This makes business sense. Full-fare paying passengers should have priority over those who pay discounted fares, except for senior citizens. In other businesses such as air travel, you get priority when you pay a premium," he argued.</div>

So, public transport should be the way to go to and from the area, said the police in a media briefing yesterday.<br><br>To begin with, the Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre, the main venue for the meetings, will be closed to the public from Sept 8 Â— three days before the meetings begin Â— until Sept 20, when they end.<br><br>Suntec City Mall and the office buildings will remain open.<br><br>From 10pm on Sept 10, the longest stretch of road closure will be along Nicoll Highway heading to the city, while a shorter section in the eastbound direction will be closed.<br><br>The other road closures until Sept 20 are along both carriageways of Temasek Boulevard Â— the main road leading to Suntec Singapore Â— and the short stretch of Raffles Boulevard closest to the building.<br><br>Already, motorists will be able to see bright neon signs put up along the street to inform them of the coming road closures. Two weeks before the event, there will be advisory signs to indicate alternative routes. Once the roads are closed, there will be directional signs so that drivers will know where to turn.<br><br>Said Traffic Police Commander Ng Guat Ting: "Congestion and delays are expected during this period ... We seek the public's patience and cooperation in securing everyone's safety."<br><br>For members of the public who take cabs, they can only stop at Suntec Towers 1 and 2 (outside Mango), between Suntec Towers 3 and 4 (outside Carrefour) and Marina Square (opposite Pan Pacific Hotel). Shuttle buses will stop either at Suntec Tower 2 or Carrefour.<br><br>The lanes of nine roads will also be closed at certain times during the 10-day period, due to activities hosted at other venues, such as the Esplanade.<br><br>Public transport operators have been apprised of the traffic arrangements and are ready to cater to any increased ridership to the area if people switch to public transport.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"We are going to use our spare fleet, which are usually for buses that break down. So, we'll use our entire fleet,"</span> ComfortDelGro group corporate communications officer Tammy Tan told Today.</strong><br><br>If motorists still insist on driving, though, they will be able to pick up one of 300,000 pamphlets the police will be distributing at Shell, SPC and ExxonMobil petrol kiosks to get a detailed map of the roads affected.<br><br>Motorists like Mr Ron Awyong, 30, will probably give the Suntec area a miss, though.<br><br>"Although Suntec is popular with young parents like myself, there won't be the usual convenience of driving there," he said. "Imagine lugging a pram and baby in the human crush if I have to park further away. And for people who are used to driving, like me, public transport is a last resort."<br><br>Visit <a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg" rel="nofollow">www.spf.gov.sg</a> for more information</div>
