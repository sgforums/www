            <div class='col-md body'>The Sunday Times had a report on bus travel times versus that of trains, and the results showed that MRT is not always faster. And transfers did not necessary meant it will make their transport costs cheaper. Amongst the services cited by resenting commuters include Service 106 and 111.<br><br>Routes used in comparison included 4 routes of Bus VS MRT, and 2 routes of Bus VS Bus-MRT.<br><br>The example where bus had the greatest edge over MRT is from Blk 288D Toh Guan Rd to CK Tangs, Orchard. 502 took 29/39 minutes (off-peak/peak) while Bus-MRT took 63/67 minutes.<br><br>On the opposite end was Pasir Ris MRT to CK Tangs, Orchard. Express 518 took 98/90 minutes while MRT took 44/54 minutes.<br><br>Other routes are (Bus Peak/Bus Off-peak VS MRT Peak/MRT Off-peak):<br>Ang Mo Kio MRT to Clementi MRT (165): 53/67 vs 51/68<br>Serangoon Sports Complex to Paya Lebar MRT (76): 35/45 vs 60/63<br>Choa Chu Kang MRT to CK Tangs, Orchard (190): 75(jam)/45 vs 55/50<br>SCGS to Woodlands MRT (960 VS Bus-MRT): 53/54 vs 52/51</div>

Both SBS Transit and SMRT have applied to the Public Transport Council to increase their bus and train fares.<br><br>The application came just hours before the deadline to do so expired at the end of Tuesday.<br><br>The proposals for the fare hikes, if accepted by the PTC, will be announced next month and will kick in by October.<br><br>This year, there has been a slight change in the dates.<br><br>The deadline to apply for adjustments was pushed back from May to August because the PTC said it needed time to implement changes to the Act, such as introducing new service standards.<br><br>Fuel costs have been rising for the two big bus companies, by as much as over 40 percent just in the last year.<br><br>SBS Transit says that diesel is its second biggest cost item after manpower.<br><br>So it has decided to ask for a fare increase after much deliberation.<br><br>With the formula imposing a 1.7 percent cap, SBS Transit says that most adults travelling on its buses and trains would see a one-cent to two-cent increase in fares.<br><br>If the maximum is approved, that will yield SBS Transit almost $10 million a year.<br><br>SMRT is also planning an increase averaging two cents, affecting mainly adult and senior citizen stored-value EZ-Link cards.<br><br>In many ways, the fare increase was widely expected.<br><br>When the new formula for calculating fare increases kicked in last year, the government said small and regular increases were preferred to big jumps every few years.<br><br>So, fare adjustments will probably be annual affairs now.<br><br>And both SBS Transit and SMRT have already hinted they would do so.<br><br>Both companies also say that they are mindful of the problems the fare increase would impose on the not so well off.<br><br>Hence student fares and concession passes will be unaffected.<br><br>Both companies will also have funding schemes for the lower income groups to offset any burden posed by fare increases.<br><br>But will commuters accept these arguments?<br><br>"They have the reason for raising their fares. Because of the oil.....they have to have a coverage. So I think it is ok," said a commuter.<br><br>"First, it was the oil price increase, and then the bus fares, and then the taxi fares. It all came so suddenly. It's not the amount, it's like all at once. It kind of adds up for us," said another.<br><br>"What will be, will be. But when fare increases, there will be upgrading of services and it's useful for upgrading," said a third commuter.<br><br>"Students, older people and the poor people would probably need more help," said a fourth.<br><br>The new head of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, Cedric Foo, told Channel NewsAsia that the companies should also consider discounted rates for poor school children, off-peak rates for retirees and issuing a limited number of free passes for the unemployed who need to commute for job interviews. - CNA/ir</div>

Only 3 per cent of all trips will see a three-cent increase.<br><br>SMRT said the maximum fare hike would translate to an average fare increase of two cents per trip.<br><br>Both transport operators said that the proposed fare hikes would not affect children and student fares on concession passes or using ez-link cards. SMRT added that there would be no increase for single-trip ticket fares and cash fares on its buses.<br><br>Depending on the final fare adjustments, both companies said they would help lower-income households adjust through various schemes, such as the Public Transport Fund.<br><br>The continued rise in fuel costs Â— which rose by 40 per cent over the past year Â— was cited as a reason for the fare hikes.<br><br>SBS Transit said the maximum fare adjustment would add $9.9 million to its full year's revenue Â— providing only partial relief for the $30-million increase in fuel costs last year. Diesel costs for SMRT rose from $24.1 million last year to $33.8 million this year.<br><br>The requirement to use ultra-low sulphur diesel as of last year also added $2.2 million to fuel costs, according to SBS Transit, making its $101-million energy costs the largest component Â— or 18 per cent Â— of its total operating costs.<br><br>Despite higher operating costs, however, both companies remain profitable.<br><br>SBS Transit posted net profits of $55 million in the first quarter this year and SMRT recorded a net profit of $27.4 million for the first quarter this year Â— 6.8 per cent more than the same period last year. This was due to increased train ridership and growing retail rental and advertising income.<br><br>Said SBS Transit spokesperson Tammy Tan: "<span style="font-style: italic;">While the company is still profitable, a fare adjustment is necessary to ensure that it continues to earn sufficient money to be able to invest in its operations, so as to improve its services. Buying new buses, for instance, costs money.</span>"<br><br>Last year, SBS Transit spent $150 million on 150 new air-conditioned, double-deck buses which are also wheelchair-accessible. It will be adding 50 more such buses at a cost of $25 million this year.<br><br>PTC chairman Gerard Ee said that the council will study the proposed fare hikes and come to a decision by early next month.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">We will try to minimise the impact on the consumers, bearing in mind they come from a wide range of household incomes</span>," said Mr Ee.</div>
