Fare is the same as 170. If you're comparing with EZ-link fares, it will be cheaper if you board from JB because you're paying in RM. And don't be too assured of seats unless you're first in line. SJE and CW2 depart alternately from Queen St. Generally, people will take whichever leaves next. Its slow start is due to the lack of exposure but over time more people will know of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay.. some updates here..<br><br>SMRT 950 is now coming in frequently, especially on weekends when loads can shoot. Best timing so far is a 5min wait. Weekday loads on this svc no longer consist of only school students but also workers as well. Loads generally subside at night.<br><br>Take note: The school students mentioned here are those who go home late due to extra lessons and do not use only the BAS SEKOLAH buses which they use in the morning to get to school, just for the information of those who are unwary of the current situation and utters rubbish here.</div>
