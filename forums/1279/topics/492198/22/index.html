              <p>So far i've been observing go-ahead services.Yes mrdupdup77, i
              do agree with your point. However, i found it to be more frequent
              than SBST. However, i waited up to 18mins for 382G yesterday, was
              disappointed to find out that only 1 bus was running 382G, but 3 on
              382W??</p>
              <p>i just don't like how go-ahead is making its drivers switch bus
              routes throughout the day, it causes confusion especially when
              driving 382G&gt;382W? Sometimes will go wrong route. I felt they
              could have sticked to SBST's style, one-two routes per day for
              drivers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, if you are not happy, you can leave the forum. Moreover, you have said you wanted to leave so many times and why are you still here? Please leave and do not create a scene here. Don't know still want to act clever. Cannot stand such people. LRT never reaches every single resident home area still want to tell people to shut up? </p>
              <p>Even Go Ahead Singapore has the courtesy to admit that they are looking into matters inside Facebook page. Who is this gekpohboy to tell us to shut up? Haha.</p>

                      notorious of getting delayed and bunched. Hence, sometimes a sv 12
                      can get around 80 pax. </p>
              <p>There was the part of Bedok South Road to Tanah Merah that
                      usually would get 80 pax but now you have 47 to alleviate the load

              <p>Very long never login here, so I'm amazed by the bullshit I see going on when I do login. <br><br>If you mean packed to the door like sardines = can tank the load, sure. the Citaros on Sv 12 can manage with your definition. After all, they're still on Sv 12 after so many months since they kicked the KUBs out. Right?<br><br>I suggest you go re-take the entire Sv 12 on different days of the week again before you post anything related to Sv 12. Your observations &amp; whatever numbers you cook up with (or if you disagree that you're plucking the numbers out of thin air, then the numbers you post here), are seriously flawed in reality.<br><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br>Getting delayed &amp; bunching and 1 Citaro cannot tanking the load are 2 separate issues. Even if delays don't occur (which tbh more bunching occur than delays nowadays), the Citaros would still struggle at certain sectors of the route &amp; on certain timings / days of the week (&amp; nope, not just your usual AM+PM Peak+Weekdays situation)</span></p>
              <p>You should try taking from the Bugis area during PM Peak on Weekdays and on weekends. (but this isn't a very accurate sector to observe because usually they will pull extra DDs from other svcs on Weekends just to cater to this sector)<br><br>Or from Opp Tampines East CC to Simei + Expo. (Don't tell me there's Sv 38 &amp; Sv 9 to alleviate the load to go to Simei MRT / Expo / Tanah Merah MRT or vice versa, there's a reason why alot of people rather wait for Sv 12 (&amp; Sv 9 when it's not alr packed with all the SATS Cargo people) to skip the detour that Sv 9 &amp; 38 does around Simei area just to go to Expo / Tanah Merah)<br><br>Or anywhere from Katong area onwards back to PSR during Weekends &amp; PM Peak<br><br>I look forward to your reply once you have done your observations.

              <p>Exactly like you said. The DDs on Sv 225G &amp; Sv 225W are a pretty good example. Alot of times the pax that do go to the upper deck are "indirectly forced" to go up, not because they really want to. </p>
              <p>As for Sv 222 &amp; 291, i think the pax on those svcs think abit differently though because alot of them will just chiong the upper deck when the DDs do come. Or maybe that's because the pax are also more used to the greater proportion of DDs on those svcs compared to Sv 225)</p>

              <p>Truth be told, whenever I look at the arrival frequencies for some of the recent GA svcs (from the mobile apps &amp; those monitors at the bus stops), it's a little bit scary (so I kinda can understand why your friend replied that way haha). But yeah, alittle while more and suddenly a bus appears out of nowhere. </p>

              <p>Very long never login here, so I'm amazed by the bullshit I see
              going on when I do login. <br> <br> If you mean packed to the door like sardines = can tank the load,
              sure. the Citaros on Sv 12 can manage with your definition. After
              all, they're still on Sv 12 after so many months since they kicked
              the KUBs out. Right?<br> <br> I suggest you go re-take the entire Sv 12 on different days of the
              week again before you post anything related to Sv 12. Your
              observations &amp; whatever numbers you cook up with (or if you
              disagree that you're plucking the numbers out of thin air, then the
              numbers you post here), are seriously flawed in reality.<br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br> Getting delayed &amp; bunching and 1 Citaro cannot tanking the load
              are 2 separate issues. Even if delays don't occur (which tbh more
              bunching occur than delays nowadays), the Citaros would still
              struggle at certain sectors of the route &amp; on certain timings /
              days of the week (&amp; nope, not just your usual AM+PM
              Peak+Weekdays situation)</span></p>
              <p>You should try taking from the Bugis area during PM Peak on
              Weekdays and on weekends. (but this isn't a very accurate sector to
              observe because usually they will pull extra DDs from other svcs on
              Weekends just to cater to this sector)<br> <br> Or from Opp Tampines East CC to Simei + Expo. (Don't tell me
              there's Sv 38 &amp; Sv 9 to alleviate the load to go to Simei MRT /
              Expo / Tanah Merah MRT or vice versa, there's a reason why alot of
              people rather wait for Sv 12 (&amp; Sv 9 when it's not alr packed
              with all the SATS Cargo people) to skip the detour that Sv 9 &amp;
              38 daround Simei area just to go to Expo / Tanah Merah)<br> <br> Or anywhere from Katong area onwards back to PSR during Weekends
              &amp; PM Peak<br> <br> I look forward to your reply once you have done your observations.

              <p>Wow, nice reply from you. Seems like you haven't really been in this hobby long time to really know who I am from Sgf + who I am in reality on the other FB grps. Doesn't login here often doesn't mean I have time to go create all the nonsense spam accounts. And doesn't login here also means I've more proper stuffs in life to do than staying in this forum all day.<br><br>I'm always amazed at your ability to cook up numbers from thin air. (ok la, you said it's proper loading observation, so I shall leave it as that term, proper loading observation it is)<br><br>So what? You work for the EZ-LInk company Transitlink? You work for the LTA? You go &amp; observe the passenger numbers boarding in &amp; out of each stop along the way? (which if you really did go &amp; observe the numbers loading in &amp; out of each stop, damn, you could have done much more with life during that bus ride than being obsessed with that)<br><br>The services you give in your reply all makes sense, well-said, they can alleviate the Sv 12 load. except 1 thing - Sv 10, 14, 38. 47? none of them goes to Pasir Ris (or the short stretch of Tampines that Sv 12 goes pass). <br><br>You expect the Sv 12 pax bound for PSR from Katong to walk over to Parkway Parade to take Sv 15? You expect the PSR pax to take Sv 10 to CGH &amp; then switch to Sv 17? Or take Sv 14 from Katong area &amp; switch to Sv 17 at Bedok Police Station?<br><br>You expect the pax bound for Tampines East CC area to take 38 &amp; 47 to Tanah Merah &amp; then swich to the MRT &amp; then switch to 8/18/38? Your logic is pretty good. which unfortunately, most of the uncles &amp; aunties &amp; Sv 12 pax don't agree / don't understand because that's not what they're doing to get back to Pasir Ris or Tampines. </p>
              <p>And your reply, hahah. Idk how can anyone even think a user account from Year 2005 is one of multiple spam accounts on here. Go on. </p>

              Haha rode on sv 12 for many times liao.
              Before sv 118, I always take sv 89 &gt; sv 12 to get to Expo.
              Also rode sv 12 many times from Mount Batten to Bugis. :-)
              Therefore, I know sv 12 loading quite well.
              BusAnalyzer has the tendency to jump to conclusion after observing a FEW times, or sometimes, based on assumptions. So I suggest that no need to get so worked up, lots of ppl get into fights with him incase you don't know.
              Have a good day ahead! :-)
