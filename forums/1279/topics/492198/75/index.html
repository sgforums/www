              <p>This is one POV which i think is equally likely to be true,
              given also that previously the report by straits times highlighted
              their experience in taking on electric buses. Also, the policital
              side might come in play as what wsy1234 mentioned about China's One
              Belt One Road which may see China playing a much prominent role in
              many global markets. Plus, their bid is significantly lower than
              the incumbents</p>
              <p>However there is also be carbikebus' opinion which is equally
              logical too. The circumstances here is definitely different frm
              those in HK-CHN (referring to cross border buses), and the fact
              that LTA might still prefer SBS due to their experience. Also, even
              if they know about their electric buses, operations here may be
              tough due to different road conditions and also climate</p>

              <p>yes.. if they die die want to win, they will bid much lower.. their price for this is similar to the seletar package (which have more buses)....</p>
              <p>there is 50 million difference in the bid price between SBST and lowest bidder. unless that lowest bidder proposal is bad.... even SMRT have lower bid price as well... chance of SBST winning is low...</p>

              <p>In the past only 160/170 had free transfers and only at WDL X-ing. Even the fare stages of these 2 routes were coordinated in such a way as to allow this arrangement to be possible.</p>
              <p>Now, all assets belong to government. Furthermore it is now mileage-based fares that are charged.</p>

              <p>no, it's the schedulling. Take 170 and most of the time it will go 60kmh without stopping at bus stops that often, while for 67 even if there is a 170 approx 8 mins behind + 67 stops at quite a number of bus stops, the 170 will eventually overtake, especially during off peak.</p>
