              <p>Non-GCM / Non-BCM stuff, please discuss at other threads.</p>
              <p><strong>At the rate replies are posted, this thread will be

              <p>The earlier thread lasted for around two years, and this, around
                  one year only?</p>
              <p><strong>I'm okay if there has been strong discussions about BCM,
                  but it seems that many a times, it's not related to the BCM

                  negotiated contracts (when was the last time we discussed about
                  negotiated contracts?)</strong></p>
              <p>and, @carbikebus, enough about your "prediction" on which
                  operator might win which tender, or which depots might remain and
                  where new depots might be located. You have been writing this
                  repeatedly for many times already. It's time to write something
                  else.</p>
              <p><strong>For discussions about 969, it can be done at other
                  threads like the bus interchange thread and bus loading
                  thread.</strong></p>
              <p>Those about bus deployment can be discussed at other threads
                  like the bus depot thread.</p>

              <p>I understand you own this thread, but it doesnt mean that it has to be very lasting for more than 2 years or more or forever if u wished it could be, but i think as long as everyone contributes happily, I think this thread will still be very healthy. Which do you prefer? A thread that is being kept alive by ppl who makes ONE post once every month or a thread that contains intense discussion? It is a forum for a reason, where everyone can discuss about their opinion openly, and not being restricted by whatsoever. If you find someone with strong opinions that they repeatedly voice out, let them be, don't pinpoint and hurt others. In fact their opinions could make other fellow forum contributors ponder about it and make their own opinions.</p>
              <p>I understand your frustrations that the thread is not going on like what you expect it to be, but if you feel strongly abt anything that has not been discussed lately, why not you initiate you views now? No point blaming others not discussing it right?</p>
              <p>Plus, things abt 969 and bus deployments, there wil obv be some grey areas that will overlap thru mulitple threads, and would be inconvenient for forum contributors to switch threads now and then to see the discussed topic, and that is why some would choose to discuss it here. Did you realise that the DTL2 rationalisation thread is suddenly filled with BPJITH discussions? While i think it is not really related to that thread per se, but as long as ppl r willing to discuss, why stop them?</p>
              <p>I joined the forum is to have a greater perspective about the bus industry and learn more about it, so why stop ppl frm learning more at the same time too?</p>
              <p>I hope my tone isnt too condesending, but I hope that you could can understand that it would be great that if you aren't too anal abt who post what in which thread. In fact, you also contributed well from what I observed (rmb that trash dove? Thou it could be annoying but i find that it spiced up the thread a little), even though there were some random posts here and there, just like what I sometimes end up doing too. Don't worry too much OK? Just be nice and ppl would be nice to you :)</p>

                  well from what I observed (rmb that trash dove? Thou it could be
                  annoying but i find that it spiced up the thread a little), even
                  though there were some random posts here and there, just like what
                  I sometimes end up doing too. Don't worry too much OK? Just be nice
                  and ppl would be nice to you :)</p>
              <p>Cheers ;)</p>
              <p>PS Oh if u legit are thinking of going back (?) to Malaysia,
                  there are also a lot of interesting buses to spot haha</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I understand the rationale. However this GCM thing will mean that the future services for Punggol bus interchange expansion will go to SBST since Go Ahead can only have 25 services as stated in contract? Meaning next feeder service will be SBST? Strange concept though. Note Punggol will have in total more than 52 parking lots after expansion and the number of bus services currently is only 16. Still got many slots to go. Thanks.</p>

              If the future svcs from Punggol are operated by SBST, they belong to which package ah?
              That's why I say the number of svcs in each is just a number.

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes somehow the extra future bus services must go to loyang or Sengkang-hougang package. Means should just be a numbers game. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
