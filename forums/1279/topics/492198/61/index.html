              <p>(In fact isn't gonna be like that in the long run, just like

              <p>I understood..But again if cost if the deciding factor,Then TTS &amp; GAS will stand no change againts these two incumbents.The foreign operators doesnt have any MRT,CDS,Premium or any influential shareholders.</p>
              <p>If SBST win back Loyang,Do you think they want to hire back their ex-staffs?ï˜‚ï˜‚</p>
              <p>The purpose of competition is to create more jobs to locals...Most of them are reluctant to join SBST to he honest.</p>

These bus services will operate out of the new Seletar Bus Depot which is scheduled to be handed over to SBST in August 2017. Besides the Seletar Bus Depot, SBST will also manage Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang Bus Interchanges.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Evaluation Process</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">3.  The tender for the Seletar bus package was launched on 7 June 2016 and attracted nine bids when it was closed on 27 October 2016. All tender submissions were evaluated based on the same set of criteria through a two-envelope process which looked at quality and price factors. With greater weightage given to the quality proposals submitted by tenderers, the price envelopes were only opened after the quality evaluation was completed. This two-envelope process allows LTA to raise the service levels of our bus industry and at the same time get the best value for money. Overall, all the bids for this package was closely matched in terms of quality and they were also competitively priced.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">4.  SBST was awarded the contract as it had the highest combined total score for both quality and price evaluation. In its tender submission, SBST demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of ground conditions and strong competence in bus service scheduling to enable the optimal deployment of buses and resources to meet travel demand. Furthermore, SBST has emphasised in its proposal a stringent maintenance regime for bus assets and infrastructure and committed to a significant number of experienced technicians to ensure high maintenance and reliability standards. In terms of manpower development, SBST has presented a robust career development program to up-skill its staff, and a comprehensive transition plan to minimise impact to commuters and affected bus workers.</span><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Scope of Contract</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;">5.  Under the contract, SBST will operate 26 two-way bus services from Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang and Yishun Bus Interchanges, to Bukit Batok, Bukit Merah, Eunos Bus Interchanges and Shenton Way Bus Terminal.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">6.  Drawing from the experience with the first two packages, SBST will take over services in the Seletar bus package in five tranches starting from the first quarter of 2018. With a smaller number of bus services and vehicles in each tranche, the bus operator will be able to better address any teething issues during the transition period.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">7.  In addition to operating and managing bus services to specified performance standards, SBST’s responsibilities include the following:</span></span></p>

These guidelines detail the obligations and responsibilities of both incoming and outgoing bus operators, including the timeline for the offer of employment, recognition of the length of service, employment terms to be safeguarded, treatment of affected bus employees including those who choose to stay with the outgoing operator, as well as training for those who choose to join the incoming operator.</span></span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 5px;"> </p>
              <p>SBS Transit has been awarded the Seletar Bus Package, which is the third set of public bus services that has been put up for tender under the Bus Contracting Model. The award of the five-year contract, which can be extended by another two years, is the first bus tender award for SBS Transit under the new model.</p>
              <p>Under the package, SBS Transit will progressively from 1Q 2018, operate 26 bus services, of which two will be new. These services will originate from the Ang Mo Kio, Yio Chu Kang and Yishun Bus Interchanges and supported by the new Seletar Bus Depot. Currently, SBS Transit operates 13 of the 24 existing bus services. With this award, it will run 13 new routes.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit Chief Executive Officer, Mr Gan Juay Kiat, said: “We are delighted that the LTA has given us this vote of confidence based on the quality of our proposal and price competitiveness. We will invest more in both hardware and software to deliver quality bus services to our commuters and look forward to rolling out the 26 services under the BCM from 1Q 2018.”</p>
              <p>Under the terms and agreement of the tender, commuters can look forward to better services and facilities at the bus interchanges. For instance, handphone charging stations will be made available at the Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang Bus interchanges. At the non-air-conditioned Yio Chu Kang Interchange, more fans and water coolers will be installed while the canteen will be air-conditioned for the comfort of our commuters, Bus Captains (BC) and staff.</p>
              <p>A new commuter engagement initiative, “Meet the Managers”, will be rolled out, enabling commuters to share their feedback and suggestions face-to-face with management at the bus interchanges. Besides this, annual commuter satisfaction surveys will also be conducted to identify areas where we can do better.</p>
              <p>In commuter safety, all buses plying the 26 services will be fitted with a smart anti-collision system known as Mobileye, which detects, analyses and monitors road conditions while the buses are on the move. It provides audio-visual warnings so that our BCs can take defensive actions to avert a collision; delivering safer journeys for our commuters.</p>
              <p>Our ISO55001 Bus Asset Management framework and systems, which we were recently certified in, will enable us to effectively manage our operational and engineering assets under the Seletar Bus Package. Leveraging on technology, our staff, including the workshop technicians, are already actively using mobile applications and tablets for higher productivity and efficiency to provide better quality service to our commuters.</p>
              <p>Bus Captains play a very critical role. With higher starting salaries, new local BCs can earn up to $3,460 a month, including allowances, incentives and overtime pay in their first year of service with us. Free annual health screenings, free travel and $500 worth of flexible benefit credits are among the slew of benefits we offer.</p>
              <p>At the Seletar Depot, our BCs will be encouraged to stay healthy as facilities such as a gym, health check corner and other recreational amenities will be provided. They can also look forward to establishing careers in the bus industry as we adopt a progressive wage model and offer alternative career pathways.</p>
              <p>For the Seletar Bus Package, we plan to hire about 330 more Bus Captains and staff.</p>
              <p>For affected BCs, who are driving the existing routes operated by SMRT, we will work closely with the National Transport Workers’ Union for their transition if they opt to join us. With our commitment to strong and harmonious labour-management relations, and the staff engagement plans that we have mapped out, these affected BCs can expect to cross over smoothly.</p>
              <p>With the award of the Seletar Bus Package, SBS Transit will operate a total of 223 bus routes, with 197 under the eight Negotiated Contracts.</p>

              <p>When you wanna try out a new bus make you will want to first try
              out with a small sample size. </p>
              <p>It makes no sense for SMRT, who alr is procuring A95s steadily
              and already have 100+ ADLs in service, to take in 15 ADLs for no
              particular reason. It isn't economically sound too. </p>
              <p>As for TTS — they actually DUMPED out ADL, you would expect them
              to take back the 15?</p>

              <p>I think TTS dumping ADL could be politically fueled. Some of the TTS ang moh were from ADL, and they left ADL at a pretty bad note.</p>

              <p>Are u kidding me bro? Causeway-link? No way they will even be interested in our BCM!</p>
              <p>And carbikebus always pointed out, experience play a minor part in BCM (which i still disagree to some extent), but is the headways and freq that matters.</p>
              <p>Tbh, how many of you guys think that SBS and SMRT are screwing up the cross-border operations so badly that LTA shld srsly consider abt giving it to other operators? (If Trans Star were to bid, if they ever were to, they might have some chance, given they also have cross-border operation experience)</p>
