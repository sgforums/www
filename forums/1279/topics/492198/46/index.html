                              <p>Yes, having the same model in large quantity is more cost effective.</p>
                              <p>This is called "economies of scale".</p>
                              <p>When the order is large, Manufacturers and Advertising companies usually offer substantial discounts, as producing in large quantities lowers the unit cost of production. This enables the bus company to procure the products and services at lower prices, and as a result, they are able to generate higher revenue.</p>
                              
                              <p>When there are only a few models, Technicians can become specialised in handling the buses. As they become specialised, they tend to make less mistakes, and thus productivity increases.</p>
                              
                              <p>With higher revenue and productivity, banks and financial institutions would be more willing to provide financial support to the bus company, at lower rates.</p>
                              
                              <p>^^ Which is why Go-Ahead only wants B9TLs and Citaros, and they outsource the advertising to Moove media.</p>
                              
                              <p>However, the lack of communication and coordination in the very beginning worked against them.</p>
                              
                              <p>Hopefully, things are better now, because there are indeed economies of scale to be reaped from Go-Ahead's way of operating and managing the bus services.</p>

              <p>then go-ahead should find way to improve on their mechanic skill to repair the buses... cant even maintain/repair some 4 years old buses?  die die must use new buses? even if give them new buses also will become lousy buses very soon.</p>
              <p>then what  about SBST? SBST have to send over those BSEP citaros/B9TL to TT/GA...</p>
              <p>what do they get in return to operate? even older KUB/citaros/B9TL...sv50 are getting those 10 year old CDGE B9TL... so shouldnt SBST be the one who complain about higher maintainance cost/downtime? other BSEP service also getting KUB as well.  are you saying that these older buses are in better condition than those 33xx series B9? </p>

              <p>ADL agent move to KL? Rapid Bus using E200 and E500 aren't they? Anyway i hope the minority SD fleet gets supplied by Scania. in fact Penang (KUB + E500) has nicer fleet than LTA (Citaro + B9TL). HK lagi best. E500 Mk 4 sia.</p>
              <p>If like Beijing, that also means we get A24 deployed on GCM/BSEP basis.</p>

              <p>Well, I believe when the buses are procured, they come with warranty. If spoil, can ask the manufacturer to repair.</p>

But this is not yet considering the A95 which is a brand new product just introduced in Asian markets a year plus ago.
