              <p>Causeway Link still pocket their fares. Every less ringgit paid
              riding 170 is every extra ringgit Causeway Link earns. They have
              more incentive than a GCM operator...</p>
              <p>LTA has no understanding how 170 works in reality.</p>
              <p>The nature of these routes are logical. I am supportive of SBS
              Transit holding onto these routes, so I am not going to give away
              anything that give other rivals a chance.</p>

              <p>Try using Microsoft Word to write, and then copy-paste (CTRL + A; CTRL + C at Microsoft Word)(Ctrl + V at forum)(use computer to select the text you want to use, if necessary)</p>
              <p>That's my "secret" to writing "long" articles.</p>
              <p>I notice it is very hard to write at the forum itself.</p>
              <p>The text by default is Times New Roman, and the layout of the forums do not encourage "long" messages, which actually restricts thinking.</p>
              <p>Maybe that's why you find it hard to express yourself.</p>
              <p>Anyway, rest assured. Your explanations are not flawed. I understand the articles you write, and I had made it a point to respond to every point that you made in the articles.</p>

                  <p>If my guess is correct, the traffic jam is due to the long weekend from 28 April to 1 May.</p>
                  <p>The road works near Woodlands Checkpoint have been around for many months now. Had similar encounters previously, but the jam is not that bad as what was described in this forum.</p>
                  
                  <p>The traffic jam is probably an isolated case, as many people use the causeway during the long weekend.</p>
                  <p>Now that the long weekend is over, the congestion problem should be resolved.</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks for the sharing. I didn't know that each company is only allowed to run up to 150 buses across the border everyday.</p>
              <p>If that's the case, why they put 160 and 170 together, instead of put them at different operators?</p>
              <p>If every bus service has 150 buses to run, actually this would increase the capacity significantly, and bus service will surely improve.</p>
              <p>However, the problem is that this may worsen the traffic congestion problem already on the Causeway and around Woodlands Checkpoint, because more buses means more traffic, and if the traffic management don't improve, actually it's gonna worsen the situation, instead of improve it.</p>

              <p>Once enough people walk across the causeway in the morning to be
              noticed, LTA will increase that quota.</p>
              <p>In any case, Causeway Link still has room to increase the
              capacity with its 150 existing buses...but I will not give away

              <p>there are already so many people walking across the causeway every morning/evening..  LTA wont be bother about it.. cos all the buses are jammed along the causeway.. so u add more buses also no use.. cos if u walk, u take 20 mins to reach counter from JB CIQ. if u take buses, u can stuck one hour in the bus for the bus to reach Woodland Checkpoint from JB CIQ. </p>
              <p>add so many buses also no use, when the immigration counters cant take in the number of ppl arriving together. and when the bus checkpoint take their own sweet time to do the clearance for each bus...</p>
              <p>wait until ICA improve their clearance process (esp their automatic clearance system are still alway down and often have to restart). </p>
              <p>the 150 buses for CW is definitely not enough, if u see the complains posted by ppl taking CW3/4/6. and right now a lot of CW buses are already doing u-turn at JB custom. </p>

              <p>did u interpret wrongly? that msg is saying the cost of running
              a team in china is RMB1-2 million.. while the cost of running the
              same team in developed country is US$2 million.. so the cost of
              running the management team in singapore definitely wont be just
              RMB1-2 million per year. u cant compare china salary to singapre
              salary.. </p>

              <p>Hi lemon1974, </p>
              <p>Probably I interpreted wrong. It sounds like their advantage is they will save money on management by paying their management team at Chinese salary rate, so they can tender for a low price. I was assuming they only need to hire some local to count coins, whom might earn even higher than an admin staff located in China (say, 1500SGD to 7500RMB).</p>
              <p>Even by cutting the price to extremely low, they will still be higher than current operators. Because they have to reprint station posters, pay for new Macdonald style uniforms and Free Lunch on Depot open day. That will keep newcomers out of the game.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
