              <p>Quite the contrary actually. 34 constantly flies the SATS Canteen stop, filled with residents from tamp, both east and west. 53, being the only svc to CGA from Loyang and PSR, is no better. </p>

              <p>110 relieves the load for 858, NOT the airport. It doesn't even touch any suburbs in the east, so why would you even claim that ALL svcs will be able to cope? </p>

              <p>Even if 110 only plies T4.. what's the use eh? The bulk of ppl working in T1 to T3 will still continue taking 27 or 858.. and ofc you still have the many more in the north and the east still crammed into 34, 53, 858..</p>

                  <p>Indeed. Thankfully, in 2014, SMRT procured 40 units of MAN articulated buses. They can be purchased by LTA and deployed on airport bus routes if required. If need be, more articulated buses can be procured to serve the airport.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I agree with you. On the other day I took service 34 from Punggol to CHangi airport terminal 2 to take my flight. It was the 2nd bus which depart Punggol interchange at 5.42am early in the morning. I thought I am damn clever to take the first 2 buses in the morning to airport and I expect it to be one hell of a fast ride being in the early morning with lots of empty space in the bus.</p>
              <p>Oh boy I was damn wrong. At Punggol side, there was a steady line of people queuing at interchange. It was not crowded initially. By the time it reaches tampines side, it was super crowded. At every stop, many people boarded. Not sure why it was like this. People were standing so close to my legs since I was sitting right from the start. So many people boarded all over tampines and never did I expect it to be so bad just like 858 at TPE stop. This goes to show many at tampines depended on service 34 to get to CGA. Guess it will continue to be like this since 34 is the only service connecting tampines and Terminal 4 in time to come. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
