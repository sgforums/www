                      <p>With regards to Gali Batu terminal, I have a feeling that it would be SMRT operating the bus terminal.</p>
                  
                  <p>This is because in the certificate issued last week for commuters taking the first bus out of Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange, the "General Manager" title has the word "(Gali Batu)" beside it. I have a feeling that this means Gali Batu terminal would be managed by SMRT.</p>
                      
                      <p>As for the temporary bus park, it's probably the temporary facility before Gali Batu terminal opens.</p>

                      <p>Yes, unless they decide to use A22s on 160 and 170, then this means more A22s would be registered with SPAD, which would be easier cuz already got track record, and also easier to register next time (if all the crossboarder buses use the same bus model).</p>
                      
                      <p>Whereas for the A22s involved, they can be swooped with Citaros.</p>

              <p>No that's not the point omg, I understand that the purpose of 110 is NOT to alleviate the crowds in the east.. I'm saying that the LR solution is to build DD friendly terminals, and it's absolutely ludicrous to claim that 110 alone can solve the overcrowding issues of all airport svcs.. never did I say that 110 should solve problems in the east, that was never 110's job..</p>
              <p>If you reroute 110 to ply the east what's the bloody point for northeast residents then?? It's just gonna be another 27.. and 858 will still be crowded as before (if not worse w T4)...</p>

              <p>If someone does not believe what i have said previously, here's an evidence that the problem with airport services are real. Yes i know for some ppl 110 may look like a white elephant, but wouldn't it be better to let's observe the situation of 110 for abt a week to a month to decide and start any argument war here? Why are you counting chicken b4 they are hatched?</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 25px;"><strong>China firm's One Belt, One Road, one Singapore bus bid</strong></span></p>
                      
                      <p>State-owned Shenzhen Bus Group (SZBG) sees its bid for Singapore's fourth bus contract - its maiden overseas foray - as part of China's One Belt, One Road initiative.</p>
                      
                      <p>Explaining its decision to venture overseas, SZBG deputy general manager Joe Ma told The Straits Times that "the time is right for the company to seize the initiative and build on its clear successes in its home market".</p>
                      
                      <p>"In so doing, SZBG is also acting to support China's Belt and Road Initiative, whereby enterprises, particularly those providing infrastructure and services, are encouraged to venture into the global market," he said.</p>
                      
                      <p>The Singapore bus market "is considered one of the best and most prestigious in the world", he said.</p>
                      
                      <p>The fourth bus package is relatively small with 18 routes. The previous one had 26. It drew five other bidders - SBS Transit, SMRT, Tower Transit, Go-Ahead and Jiaoyun Group-Travel GSH consortium.</p>
                      
                      <p>Mr Ma said SZBG is the largest public transport operator in Shenzhen, in south-eastern China. It has an all-electric fleet of some 5,700, making it the world's biggest electric bus operator.</p>
                      
                      <p>With Hong Kong's Kowloon Motor Bus as a stakeholder, SZBG also runs a number of cross-border services between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.</p>
                      
                      <p>Mr Ma reckons this gives it an edge in the Bukit Merah package, which includes two cross-border services to Johor Baru.</p>
                      
                      <p>The company, set up in 1975, also employs several pioneering technologies, such as mobile phone bus fare payment, a "lost and found" app, and a patented fast electric-charging technology.</p>
                      
                      <p>"In addition, we are pioneering premium on-demand bus services and the use of artificial intelligence in the form of predictive analytics," he said.</p>
                      
                      <p>Mr Ma added that SZBG is also testing face-recognition technology to monitor a bus driver's behaviour and fatigue level, vehicle collision avoidance systems, and devices to detect corrosive and inflammable substances onboard.</p>
                      
                      <p>"Despite Singapore's relatively smaller physical size compared with Shenzhen, we recognise and admire the city's prominent global status as an international tourism and event destination, attracting well over 16 million international visitors in 2016," Mr Ma said.</p>
                      
                      <p>Apart from public buses, SZBG's business covers taxis (with 2,800 of them being electric), limousine and car rental services, bus advertising services, property development and management, new energy, big data and financing.</p>
                      
                      <p>It has a fleet of some 11,000 vehicles with total assets of 8 billion yuan (S$1.6 billion) and a workforce of 25,000.</p>

Keeping an open mind, i think they wont hire all PRCs or be biased by employing them more easily, just like how TT and GA opened up to all. Of course, PRCs here or in the region will likely be more drawn to this contract and definitely more will apply for a job coz its a co that is based in their hometown. But be aware that if that is to happen, those driving cross borders ought to know simple malay too! just to clarify, the current BCs driving cross borders are mostly, if not all, are malaysians and a few singaporeans right? i dun rmb any other FTs driving these routes</p></div>
