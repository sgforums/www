              <p>If SMRT win, they will just spam shitaro after shitaro on all Yishun services.  Even for them having bendies is not going to be much of an advantage because most of them are retiring in due course and there are only a total of 40 A24s, of which AMDEP has only 10 or so available for Yishun anyway.</p>
              <p>Coupled with the fact that the NSL parallels the two Yishun trunks, it will always be SMRT's interest to jialatise 851 and 852 so that nobody want to take them (like the state they are in now) so that they can push pax to their trains, since they are taking all money earned from train tickets as compared to buses which they are paid the same no matter how many passengers their buses take.</p>

              <p>I predict Go Ahead Singapore will not get it. They ran into problems again. Their model of outsourcing refueling to other companies are subjective to issues which are not totally in their hands. Newspapers reported that the outsourced companies underpaid their workers. They sort of protested and stopped refueling for last few days due to underpayment. </p>
              <p>Now whoever thought that bus drivers don't do own refueling is a good thing? It is a benefit provided by Go Ahead and it is good for the bus drivers but it strikes back at the Go Ahead company itself. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, then what is the bloody difference too? They allow sbs transit and smrt to bid for seletar package and they will not choose them no matter what? Like that, they may as well tell them not to bid. </p>
              <p>For my mail above, I am trying to tell that LTA may have been dumbfounded by the flow of events leading up to the Go Ahead Singapore issue which causes them to delay the closure of seletar package tender. So stability may have overridden other criterias. Do not forget that seletar package introduction was way before the Go Ahead issue.</p>
              <p>Your point of LTA introducing 3 packages to raise foreign stakes in local transport scene will be very valid before the Go Ahead debacle in the authorities mind. However, it has all changed after the issue. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Just kidding. Srsly, it's hard 2 decide which is better. I feel
              that SBS and TTS are equally good. Maybe should let TTS win, cuz
              they small.</p>

              <p>I predict Go Ahead Singapore will not get it. They ran into
              problems again. Their model of outsourcing refueling to other
              companies are subjective to issues which are not totally in their
              hands. Newspapers reported that the outsourced companies underpaid
              their workers. They sort of protested and stopped refueling for
              last few days due to underpayment. </p>
              <p>Now whoever thought that bus drivers don't do own refueling is a
              good thing? It is a benefit provided by Go Ahead and it is good for
              the bus drivers but it strikes back at the Go Ahead company itself.
              Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Amdep can continue use Amdep,Lydep and probably some of Seletar lots for their BCM.Can park around 40 buses at Sembawang too.</p>
              <p>For Kjdep side,They can utilise BPJ bus park once Bt Panjang ITH is ready.Can park around 35 buses and can use part of Woodlands Bus park.</p>
