              <p>Actually, to manage the bus service better, it may be better to merge 160, 170, 170* and 950 into one, and remove the bus connection to Larkin Bus Terminal.</p>

              <p>I feel like slapping Gekpohboy alr. (ok i dun literally mean it but sorry for getting triggered) "remove the bus connection to Larkin Bus Terminal...Larkin Bus Terminla is for holiday makers...only a few people (around 30) actually take 170 everyday to get from Larkin Bus Terminal to Singapore..." I admit i  cannot physically be present at the checkpoint to observe this but at least make comments that make sense like carbikebus. And here are the reasons why:</p>
              <p>1. If u talk abt people commuting to Singapore daily, workers have their blue Bas Pekerja/Bas Kilang and students have their orange Bas Sekolah, and the fact that it is also not convenient for commuters to transfer at Larkin to get out of Singapore, so yes, maybe can remove. --&gt; But bear in mind, the freq of 170 is at abt 10-15 min per bus, so that stretch frm JB CIQ to larkin with standees is justified. Plus, there are also crucial bus services at Larkin (other than express bus services in case udk)</p>
              <p>2. Have you seen how hectic it gets especially it gets to important festive seasons like CNY and hari raya? Yes we have alternatives (CW1,2, SJE), but 170 is still favoured by many due to its cleanliness, reliablity, and convenience (yes, surprisingly even when ppl are in Malaysia). And we are not talking abt practicality, we are talking abt favourism. Commuters dun talk abt practicality, they think abt favourism. Its literally hell in case you havent been there yet. (Consider this: long queues for 170X at Kranji MRT, but not as much for CW1. Why?)</p>
              <p>Yes i agree with you that the loop at JB Sentral is redundant, but personally I think this is the best way: 170X will still continue to go to JB Sentral as well as 160. Reason being some 170X shifts can convert to 170 and proceed to Larkin aft clearing JB Customs, and the fact that 160 freq is also poor, it shldnt be a prob ferrying those 1 or 2 lazy ppl to JB Sentral. 950, like what carbike bus mentioned, shld go to Larkin. And yes, 170X needs parking lots, and i mentioned b4 there ought to be a proper ter to house 170X and CW1 to handle the mess and danger everytime at that bus stop (yes dangerous, literally. 925 long queues and crowd and buses cutting in to the bus stop dangerously. Chaotic). I wont agree to you 170M idea thou.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A qns for carbikebus: Why such thoughts for AC7?</p>

              <p>Yup, and thats my point for Gekpohboy too. (I'm really sorry if i happen to have problem expressing myself clearly haha) Why would u want Causeway Link to monopolise causeway operations? Are they handling it better than we do? Total withdrawal of 170 route worsens the bottleneck. Bear in mind the RTS is yet to be built (and no concrete timeline is given to the public as of yet, its hard to discuss abt the impact as it is not gonna happen in the near future)</p>

And do help me explain to gekpohboy that why 170 shldnt be shortened to JB CIQ, even the Larkin stretch is redundant, due to loss in cost of operations. Thanks.
