              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, a responsible bus company will not tolerate such stuff. Then all I can say transperth is not responsible. </p>
              <p>Go ahead must seriously address its shortcoming of missing buses and not leaving interchange when it is supposed to. There is a standard to maintain when being awarded contracts. This should be the way rather than asking the public to leave home earlier. By the way, if leave home earlier and buses still don't appear, it is as good as ...Root cause of missing buses and bus headway must be addressed. No other illogical explanation or countermeasure like ask public to make up for their shortfall should be accepted.</p>
              <p> Obviously gekpohboy points are not valid. All he does merely is to write 'crowd-seeking attention' posts. Please do not fall for it. Thanks.</p>

              <p>It isn't. From my experience, Transperth these days doesn't
              really care even if you report fellow passengers getting assaulted.
              There's an awful lot of anti-social behaviour I have witnessed on
              Transperth this week.</p>
              <p>carbikebus claimed that even he, along with others, were banned
              by GA on Facebook. But I cannot confirm what really happened, so I
              can't comment on this. But from my experience, I personally think
              GA is relatively courteous.</p>
              <p>But if your are late for school, your school principal will tell
              you to use an alternative or arrive earlier, as gekpohboy said. At
              least that's what mine did many years ago.</p>
              <p>But you do know how much of a wayang is GCM/BCM at this
              point.</p>

              <p>If trips do not operate at all, then the operator must pay liquidated damages for every trip lost. They cannot wiggle out anymore.</p>
              <p>First/Last bus non-operation is the worst of the possible offences. Before GCM/BCM, I understand that at operator level they were to be operated "at all costs". If there is one trip you must not operationally screw up, it is the last bus.</p>
              <p>Extra trips by the operator comes at their own cost and brings no extra payment from LTA.</p>
