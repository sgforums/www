              <p>If in that case, might as well give Svc 36 back to SBS Transit and have it the way it used to be. I agree that it is not far away but it maybe gives a bad impression to the tourist that you have to board it at T2 instead of boarding at T3 and T1 where their flights lands.</p>
              <p>So must get Go-Ahead deploy staff and inform the passengers. Common for Singaporeans and some tourist not to read the service details as they have a guide book and all guide books do mention that Svc 36 goes to City from Terminal 3, 1 &amp; 2.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion... But I do think it is very absurb to have those wanting to take svc 36 to board the service from T2 instead of right at where they landed in T3 &amp; T1</p>

              <p>All the way there is no issue in boarding at T3.  So did Go-ahead change the route? If so, they should remove the 36 queue at T3/T1. Is there any poster that T1/T3 that ask paxes who wan to board sv36 to go to T2?  Further , the paxes were able to board a sv36 bus after 1 hour. So that mean that sv36 is still picking up paxes. Just that GA screw up the operation by making many buses off service at that timing. </p>

              <p>It is high time LTA does something about the bus infrastructure at CGA. There is so much time wasted per bus moving from one terminal to another, do security check everytime and the basements are usually hot and unhealthy with fumes. </p>
              <p>Buses should just operate on the main level like taxis do. They can relook the map of CGA and figure out a way to do it. </p>
              <p>Now with T4 coming up next year, what each bus will enter T4 as well?? </p>
              <p>If they do it by the roadside without these security checks, the movement between terminals will be quick and even faster even after doing T4.</p>

              <p>If in that case, might as well give Svc 36 back to SBS Transit

              away but it maybe gives a bad impression to the tourist

              <p>So must get Go-Ahead deploy staff and inform the passengers.
              Common for Singaporeans and some tourist not to read the service

              that Svc 36 goes to City from Terminal 3, 1 &amp; 2.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion... But I do think it is very absurb to have
              those wanting to take svc 36 to board the service from T2 instead
              of right at where they landed in T3 &amp; T1</p>

              <p>I think being able to board at the terminal directly is a PRIVILEGE more than a given. Walking across the airport for transport connection is part and parcel of every airport, and if it compromises operations operators have no obligation to tailor its svcs to precisely cater to every single group. Of course, this is provided the inconvenience to commuters are not large. Do you think walking across an air conditioned walkway for 5 mins is a huge obstacle then?</p>
              <p>I disagree that SBST should take back the svc. SBST still terminates at T2, but boards pax anyways and hold them up at T2. If you ask me what really ruins impressions of foreigners it is having a bus that one has waited for so long, only for it to stop halfway when he most expects it to already be on its way.</p>

              <p>What makes you think they MUST wait at the berth then? Passengers could either wait in the terminal, or ideally, plan their journey so they arrive EXACTLY at the timimg, or at least enough to reduce discomfort. </p>
              <p>Even if we take that waiting is a pain. I dont think the problem is exclusive to T2, since one has to wait for the bus to arrive at T1/3 anyway.</p>
              <p>Sure, you feel providing boarding at every terminal isnt a problem. But as I've said, it is a PRIVILEGE, not an absolute. The problem does not come with a privilege being provided, it is when a firm is blamed and shunned for failing to do so.  </p>

              <p>so it still does not explain why there is queueing berth for
              sv36 at T1/T3? since it is for alighting only? </p>
              <p>and it still does not explain why there are sv36 (GA) buses
              picking up paxes at T3/T1 </p>
              <p>SBST issue a poster when T3 open, clearly mention that sv36 will
              proceed to T1/T2 before carring to the city... </p>
              <p>if GA want to change the practise, it is fine..but they need to
              put up posters to inform the paxes, so that the paxes can take
              other bus services to T2 to take sv36...  if i remember
              correctly, the destination at the bus stop at T1/T3 for sv36 show
              Tomsonlin Road.. </p>

              <p>Yeah... Both T3/T1 shows Tomlinson Road.. I agree with the arguement of lemon1974.</p>
