              <p>no one say it is easy...but GA listed out its plan/proposal and that why LTA awarded the contract to them.. so if GA cant fulfil/cant schedule buses to depart regularly and cant maintain the frequency, then what for have BCM and what for award the contract to GA?</p>
              <p>Not everyone like you is SO RICH to take taxi or drive....</p>
              <p>and do u think it is reasonable for someone to wait 40 mins for a bus? (granted that there are alternative, but not many would want to transfer buses).</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, I suggest you don't check the apps or actual situation too often. Because you will vomit blood later. I do that for some services and I find some long headway occasionally. I just treat as 1-off. Probing too much will lead you to discover other items. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, you just need to check the app for 34 and 43 more often and you realize one thing. People are not complaining about 3 buses within 14 min. People are much more concerned about the next bus after these buses go off. Just for now, around marine parade, 2 buses coming 1 after another and the next bus is a cool 30 min away. You see more of such cases everywhere. Even 3 and 83 also have that happening. This is what people are worried about. Those who complained in go ahead Facebook page are those who waited 20-30 mins and more. Yes the Facebook page is also one of the correct place to feedback for Go ahead Singapore. They spell that inside their banner in pasir ris interchange. I also asked the office guy before. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
