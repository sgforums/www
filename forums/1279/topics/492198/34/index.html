              <p>It is. Happened 2 days back along Mountbatten road. There was a
                  sv 12 SD and sv 12 DD right behind. At "Bef Walton Road" stop, the
                  passengers from sv 12 DD were made to alight and board sv 12 SD.
                  And then the "lush green" DD went off service towards NBR.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, how did the passengers tap out of the second bus? If they tap out of first bus and they need to tap in 2nd bus, they need pay again because transferring to same service will not have discounts. If they tap out of 1st bus and they did not tap in and tap out of 2nd bus, this means the passengers underpaid for their journeys. If so, Go Ahead Singapore contravened the contracts for loyang tender as fare is collected by LTA. No longer by the transport companies. In this case, Go Ahead may be subjected to fines and may also be warned. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <h2>This is to improve commuter flow and to
              encourage commuters to move to the rear of the bus</h2>
              <p><span>OCT 3, 2016</span><span style="margin-left: 5px; color: #9b9b9b;">5:50 AM</span></p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Singapore</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>PUBLIC buses with three
              doors would not only take longer to deliver but also cost
              significantly more</strong> if the Land Transport Authority (LTA)
              were to introduce them in response to the Public Transport
              Council's (PTC) Advisory Report.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Public buses currently have one
              door in front and another in the middle, between the two axles. But
              the LTA is looking at buses with a third door at the end, behind
              the rear axle, and two staircases for improved commuter flow and to
              encourage commuters to move to the rear of the bus.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The move follows some of the
              recommendations made in the PTC's Advisory Report, which aims to
              enhance the commuting experience by making bus and train travel
              more comfortable and accessible for all.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">While three-door variants are
              commonplace in Europe, virtually all of them are left-hand-drive
              (LHD) models and cannot be easily converted for Singapore's
              right-hand-drive (RHD) market.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">This is because the bus engine is
              located in the rear and the entire chassis has to be re-configured
              before the doors can be moved to the left side of the vehicle.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The senior executive of a bus
              supplier said: "We have buses with three doors but not in
              right-hand-drive. In fact, this option is not available in the
              market."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">But he added that even though this
              configuration does not yet exist, current models can be
              re-engineered to meet the requirement.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">"It is not impossible but it will
              involve significant cost," he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The senior executive declined to be
              named as he said that the LTA could be calling for a tender soon
              for both single- and double-decker buses with three doors, and he
              did not want to jeopardise his prospects.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">There are currently more than 5,500
              public buses in Singapore, operated by former incumbents SBS
              Transit and SMRT Buses, as well as newcomers Tower Transit and
              Go-Ahead.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Of these, SBS Transit runs about
              two-thirds and SMRT a quarter. Tower Transit and Go-Ahead together
              operate the remaining 10 per cent or so for now.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The transport operators use mainly
              the Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Scania and Man brands, and one of these
              is understood to be specially developing a three-door RHD bus for
              the Singapore market but only in single-deck trim.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Soon Chow Corp, Singapore's oldest
              bus manufacturer, recently built a three-door double-decker for UK
              bus body supplier Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The mock-up does not have an engine
              and will be displayed at this month's Singapore International
              Transport Congress and Exhibition.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The managing director of a bus
              chassis manufacturer said converting a three-door LHD bus to RHD
              "is difficult and involves a lot of work".</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">He said: "The development fees are
              high and because of Singapore's small volume, the cost of each bus
              will also be high."</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, irregardless of the number of people on board, this should not be condoned. Go Ahead Singapore tendered for the project at a price and LTA accepted it. This means it is shortchanging many people. Just hope that there is a fault with the bus and let's give Go Ahead Singapore the benefit of the doubt and don't dwell on it anymore. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Theirs is only 11.4m and i have taken in twice while on holidays in London..Unless Volvo/ADL/MAN/Scania can custom a 3 door DD on just 12.3m and no need 12.8m which is very risky in SG.The 3rd door should be a single sliding type.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, irregardless of the number of people on
              board, this should not be condoned. Go Ahead Singapore tendered for
              the project at a price and LTA accepted it. This means it is
              shortchanging many people. Just hope that there is a fault with the
              bus and let's give Go Ahead Singapore the benefit of the doubt and
              don't dwell on it anymore. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, accepted cheapest tender and allowed others to trim down their own keepings? Is our regulatory body so naive to let foreign companies trample on us? Super unlikely.</p>
              <p>Allow same service transfer without paying money? Sure or not? How they know that the guy is really transferring or running an errand halfway and boarding the bus again? They know they cannot control so they specially list out this term in today item of transferring with maximum 5 trips. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Further, who know how many ppl are waiting at the bus stops in front?  So the Citaro have 30-35 paxes, take in another 8 paxes fom the DD. So these 8 paxes have to stand? Then if another 15 paxes board. The bus will be full already?</p>
              <p>alternative practice is to switch to "off service" n allow for alighting only.  In the past, whereby we are using destos, SBST used to do that by flipping the destos for delayed buses (buses will move faster with only alighting). But heard that LTA prohibit this. </p>
