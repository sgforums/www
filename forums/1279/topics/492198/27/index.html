              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, so we know the real reason now. The new bus operators have difficulty adjusting to the system of a number of different routes during the week instead of one single route. So is the operator to be blamed for enforcing such a system initially? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, so we know the real reason now. The new bus
              operators have difficulty adjusting to the system of a number of
              different routes during the week instead of one single route. So is
              the operator to be blamed for enforcing such a system initially?
              Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE— Just a little over two weeks into the start
              of its bus operations here, transport operator Go-Ahead Singapore
              has lost a number of bus captains, and is engaging drivers on a
              short-term contract basis from SBS Transit and SMRT Buses to
              cope.</p>
              <p>The number of drivers who left is below 20, said a
              Go-Ahead spokesperson in response to queries. The drivers left
              because they had difficulties adjusting to the operator’s
              “interlining” model, which requires bus captains to drive a number
              of different routes during the week, instead of one single
              route.</p>

              <span style='font-family: "Benton Modern RE",sans-serif;'>“It’s
              a very flexible business model which will benefit us and commuters
              as well, because (our) bus captains know how to drive a number of
              services. But because it’s a new concept in Singapore (in) the bus
              market, it’s not very popular with our bus captains,” said the Go
              Ahead spokesperson.</span></div>
              <p>Go-Ahead Singapore, which won the second
              contract put up for tender by the Government under the bus
              contracting model, began rolling out its services on Sept 4 in
              tranches. As of now, it operates 24 services, with one more to
              begin next year.</p>
              <p>From Wednesday (Sept 21), 30 SBS Transit bus captains
              will be deployed at Loyang Depot for approximately two months to
              drive Services 358 and 359. Ten SMRT bus captains will also be
              deployed to help Go-Ahead.</p>
              <p>The request was made by Go-Ahead, which said in a press
              release on Tuesday that the attrition rate was “higher than
              expected”. The company said 38 more bus captains are due to enter
              service over the “coming weeks” and that it is sourcing for and
              recruiting more bus captains.</p>
              <p>Said the company’s deputy chairman David Cutts in the
              release: “This move is about ensuring commuters continue to receive
              a service they can rely on. I am grateful to SBS Transit and
              SMRT Buses for their support and we will work towards recruiting
              and training more Bus Captains so as to take care of the journeys
              of commuters.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, it is a real shame of BCM. Now we all know why there are missing buses in the scheduling and why the headway is so long. Cannot ask the public to leave home earlier to cover up for them. Still have chances to run into buses with long headway. Once the regular public starts to take their buses, the situation will show itself. Cannot hide and use other reasons to cover up. The truth finally surfaces out. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, should give back to Sbs transit/smrt for more

              <p>Hi mr philipC, the signs were there in the first week already. The first three days saw so many missing buses which did not depart bus interchange on time. Then there are so much headway between buses. Super long queues formed at service 386 in interchange. Many people complained and complained. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Looks like Ang Moh management style and does not fit in Singapore contact. Drivers driving more than one route in a week? maybe Carbikebus can provide more insight</p>

              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, it is a real shame of BCM. Now we all know why
              there are missing buses in the scheduling and why the headway is so
              long. Cannot ask the public to leave home earlier to cover up for
              them. Still have chances to run into buses with long headway. Once
              the regular public starts to take their buses, the situation will
              show itself. Cannot hide and use other reasons to cover up. The
              truth finally surfaces out. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>LTA should have step in n delay the handling of all services under pasir ris to GA. They could have say that GA will take over few services first. But guess LTA does not wan to lose face cos it will be kicking its own legs if it do so. </p>
              <p>So LTA just let GA take over Pasir ris route n instead ask SBST/SMRT to help. </p>
              <p>frankly speaking, I really dunno why GA need to have such schedule for BC to drive different route in one day. Does not see any benefit ? Less buses are used? Dun think so. Cut OT? Dun think so. What else?</p>
