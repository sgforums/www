              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, I don't think it is the erratic LTA school holiday scheduling. On the flat screen panels showing the time to depart the Punggol bus interchange, the buses don't even show up at all. Sometimes not just 1 bus departure can go missing. On occasions, 2 go missing. End up people keep waiting. The 2 buses were 13 min apart. But both also never come to pick up passengers. So end up is a virtual system. Haha.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, I thought they are one of the largest bus operators in the UK? They are also an experienced company in charge of transportation. Why they cannot even fulfil the basic rule of having buses leaving interchange at the timing they put on the screen? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>sv 12 is doing okay. Where do you really see that Citaros cannot
                  tank the load? Most buses have loading of 50-60 pax. But sv 12 is
                  notorious of getting delayed and bunched. Hence, sometimes a sv 12
                  can get around 80 pax. </p>
              <p>There was the part of Bedok South Road to Tanah Merah that
                  usually would get 80 pax but now you have 47 to alleviate the load
                  as well, as well as erstwhile 38. </p>

              <p>Bedok South Rd to Tanah Merah as you have mentioned (indeed, I agree that 47 has been useful in tanking part of its load). Also Tanah Merah to Simei/Tampines area (this one 38 can only partial tank). It's at Tanah Merah itself that people cannot board.</p>
              <p>If 12 cannot full DD, just don't decrease the percentage of the existing DDs can liao.</p>
              <p>I forgot to mention Sv 2 as well. You have rightly pointed out that 2 should full DD.</p>

              <p>they have more than 1/2 year to prepare already.....if BCM is
              having such issue, might as well ask SBST to run instead..(although
              SBST got bunching, but at least departure from interchange/terminal
              are usually on time, if got delay, they will also put on tv
              screen). even if there is traffic jam, they can pull buses over
              from other services.</p>
              <p>But go-ahead is tv screen put departure timing, but buses never
              appear.. maybe the departure timing is for the bus to leave the
              interchange without pax...</p>

                  U see the system already weird one esp the duties. Do 1 duty svc, Then park at interchange, wait for another svc wich maybe late, then do that svc, go depot sleep, take another svc. 
                  
                  I rmb SBST/SMRT system so rigid and simple. 1 BC 1 svc per day
