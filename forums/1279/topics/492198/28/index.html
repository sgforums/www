              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, Landtransportguru reported about GoAhead mismanagement. They say some have already resigned after Punggol takeover and soon after taking over pasir ris, there was another mass resignation. They are unhappy over no time to rest. They are being told to do 358 and 359 east and west loop non-stop without resting time at pasir ris int. They think that their previous company Sbs transit is better. They also did not fill up other positions and the offices at pasir ris closed already even when buses are still operating. </p>
              <p>So I am not too sure whether Go Ahead Singapore will stop this current practice of interlinking. If they continue on and more resigned, does it mean they want to keep borrowing from Sbs transit and make other companies get into problems with other services in Singapore? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, Sbs3004X meant the operator to win seletar package. Not Loyang. It SBST wins seletar, you cannot quit since you are Go Ahead employee.</p>
              <p>As for Loyang package, if go ahead gets kicked out, it will definitely be sbs transit taking over. Why I think like that? Because the only reason why kick out go ahead is bus schedule not reliable. The only way to prevent is must be call back the previous company which runs it for years. That company is Sbs transit. LTA always does things on a familiar situation. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, very easy for them. They can go back to Sbs transit after 2 months contract. By the way, this is Go Ahead Singapore fault. They tendered low during bid thinking they could save costs for the interlinking schedule. They think whatever practise overseas can be used for Singapore small public transport context.</p>
              <p>Anyway I have read that Go ahead Singapore has said they will start to revert back to the normal scheduling system for Punggol services first. Do you know if it has started today? This fact needs you to confirm. Hope they finally do it well for this tender. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>At least you are aware and apologetic but it is really not your fault.  Have to tell the GA management that long frequencies and too many low capacity buses are not acceptable. People cannot make it for school exam is no joke. MRT breakdown, have procedure for can take exam later provided you still reach school/take exam at a different school. Bus come late/cannot board/go off route then how? There are people who got penalised because they late due to GA; if it had been MRT they would be given time to take paper.</p>
              <p>Even VJC teacher give up and tell the school to take taxi during exam period already.</p>
