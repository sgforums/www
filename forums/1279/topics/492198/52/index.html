              <p>In fact i rmb their run time for khatib to tamp is like 40 min, which is like 10 min extra compared to last time. But with the 3 new bus stops along Tamp conc, i think 5 min extra is sufficient. But yes, 969 has been going pretty slow, and maybe what was discussed is true, where during off peak will be faster</p>

              <p>Hello, 2-3 mins cut is not sufficient, svc 969 runtime can easily shave <em><strong>at least</strong></em> 5 minutes.</p>
              <p>Standard timetable from Tampines (3rd last bus out from Tampines):<br>+01 min: Tampines Concourse stops<br>+02 mins: Stop at Tamp Ave 9<br>+16 mins: TPE stop<br>+33 mins: First stop at Lentor Ave<br>+38 mins: Khatib MRT<br>+43 mins: Yishun MRT<br>+48 mins: Last stop at Yishun<br>+54 mins: 3M @ Gambas Ave<br>+57 mins: Admiralty MRT<br>+64 mins: Woodlands MRT/Int</p>
              <p>As you can see, SMRT has scheduled a grand total of 22 mins between the TPE stop and the stop at Khatib MRT during the off-peak hours. Pre-GCM, this journey took about 12 mins in off-peak hours, and 15 mins in peak hours. Of course if you artificially add 10 mins into the schedule, then the svc 969 buses have to crawl between Punggol and Yishun!</p>
              <p>Another observation: <em><strong>Almost all</strong></em> svc 969 buses depart Tampines Int at least 5 mins later than the timing indicated on their DDUs. This seems to allow the buses to travel at normal e'way speeds to Punggol, but after that they all slow to a crawl anyway ...</p>
              <p>Last mind-blowing observation: SMRT has given svc 858 the <em><strong>exact</strong></em> same runtime between the TPE stop and the first stop at Lentor Ave (in spite of the detour to Jln Kayu), which clearly shows that SMRT is sandbagging the svc 969 schedule for no obvious reason ...</p>

              <p>Hello, 2-3 mins cut is not sufficient, svc 969 runtime can
              easily shave <em><strong>at least</strong></em> 5 minutes.</p>
              <p>Standard timetable from Tampines (3rd last bus out from
              Tampines):<br> +01 min: Tampines Concourse stops<br> +02 mins: Stop at Tamp Ave 9<br> +16 mins: TPE stop<br> +33 mins: First stop at Lentor Ave<br> +38 mins: Khatib MRT<br> +43 mins: Yishun MRT<br> +48 mins: Last stop at Yishun<br> +54 mins: 3M @ Gambas Ave<br> +57 mins: Admiralty MRT<br> +64 mins: Woodlands MRT/Int</p>
              <p>As you can see, SMRT has scheduled a grand total of 22 mins
              between the TPE stop and the stop at Khatib MRT during the off-peak
              hours. Pre-GCM, this journey took about 12 mins in off-peak hours,
              and 15 mins in peak hours. Of course if you artificially add 10
              mins into the schedule, then the svc 969 buses have to crawl
              between Punggol and Yishun!</p>
              <p>Another observation: <em><strong>Almost all</strong></em> svc
              969 buses depart Tampines Int at least 5 mins later than the timing
              indicated on their DDUs. This seems to allow the buses to travel at
              normal e'way speeds to Punggol, but after that they all slow to a
              crawl anyway ...</p>
              <p>Last mind-blowing observation: SMRT has given svc 858 the
              <em><strong>exact</strong></em> same runtime between the TPE stop
              and the first stop at Lentor Ave (in spite of the detour to Jln
              Kayu), which clearly shows that SMRT is sandbagging the svc 969
              schedule for no obvious reason ...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In addition, they did a stupid thing of adding 3 more bus stops for 969 in Tampines which was totally not required. 969 during peak hours already full from interchange; no on can board 969 along Concourse and no one will alight as people will not stand in long queue, rather take 72, 127 or walk. </p>
              <p>I really hope they revert 969 to express between Tampines and TPE Punggol once svc 68 starts plying Concourse. </p>

              <p>and FYI 883 also crawling at 20-30 km/h, it is not just 969.</p>
              <p>i think even 858 crawls at that as well.</p>

              <p>Once again,</p>
              <p><strong>This thread is only for GCM / BCM
              discussions.</strong></p>
              <p>Non-GCM / Non-BCM stuff, please discuss at other threads.</p>
              <p><strong>At the rate replies are posted, this thread will be
              filled up in less than one year since it was created in June last
              year!</strong></p>
              <p>The earlier thread lasted for around two years, and this, around
              one year only?</p>
              <p><strong>I'm okay if there has been strong discussions about BCM,
              but it seems that many a times, it's not related to the BCM
              contracts at Bulim, Loyang, Seletar or Ulu Pandan, or even the
              negotiated contracts (when was the last time we discussed about
              negotiated contracts?)</strong></p>
              <p>and, @carbikebus, enough about your "prediction" on which
              operator might win which tender, or which depots might remain and
              where new depots might be located. You have been writing this
              repeatedly for many times already. It's time to write something
              else.</p>
              <p><strong>For discussions about 969, it can be done at other
              threads like the bus interchange thread and bus loading
              thread.</strong></p>
              <p>Those about bus deployment can be discussed at other threads
              like the bus depot thread.</p>
              <p><strong>Please stop filling this thread with replies not related
              to GCM / BCM.</strong></p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
