            <div class='col-md body'>What are your fastest rides till date?<br><br>For me, the ride home on 089 yesterday is the fastest I have tried. The mkIII was pretty normal till he reached Lor Halus. Actually 9638C, 088, was directly in front, both cruising comfortably at 65km/h. Suddenly the mkIII revved up and attempted to overtake the speeding VO3X. I was scarred stiff by the sudden revving up and the mkIII reached to the point it was screaming!(Must have been 80km/h by then) The BC relaxed and speed dropped back to about 65-70km/h, unfortunately, 9638C was not to be outdone....... It played drag race with us, and the VO3X started pulling away again. The mkIII BC bo chap, until the VO3X rear was level till the front of mkIII, then the mkIII went off its rocket again and this time, the BC kept his foot on the pedal and the mkIII overtook a small lorry, a motorcycle, a car, and a garbage truck, and finally deposited itself between a scooter and a van. My heart almost fell out. The entire drag race lasted from Lor Halus to close to Sengkang, I am surprised, the mkIII was still ok.
