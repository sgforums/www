              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Reaction to new bus service 128</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commuters living in the North seem to be giving SBS Transit's new basic
                  bus service 128 service to the Central Business District a miss,
                  preferring to take the train.</p>
              <p>The new bus service which started this morning runs, parallel to
                  half the North-South MRT line providing residents in the North with an
                  alternative means of public transport to get to work.</p>
              <p>The service will have 4 trips each during the morning and evening peak hours.</p>
              <p>There were only 6 commuters travelling from Yio Chu Kang to the city area on one of the four morning peak hour trips.</p>
              <p>Most took the bus for its novelty.</p>
              <p>Among them was student Tan (not real name), a self confessed 'bus enthusiast'.</p>
              <p>"I like to try out new services and joy ride and understand the demand of the service."</p>
              <p>Another commuter was Zi Yun.</p>
              <p>"This bus reaches my office, i just wanna try if it's faster or the same time as the train."</p>
              <p>By bus however, the length of the route takes almost thrice the time compared to the train.</p>
              <p>The MRT takes an estimated 26 minutes from Ang Mo Kio to Shenton Way while the bus service takes 74.</p>
              <p>Both modes of transport cost $1.39.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, while most commuters might value their time over comfort, some are willing to compromise.</p>
              <p>"If it's slightly longer and i can sit down then i'm still fine la
                  but if it's maybe fifteen minutes more, i'll still prefer to take the
                  train"</p>
              <p>"If i'm not in the rush of time i'll take the bus and since the
                  train along north south line is usually packed i will prefer to take

              <p>Well, the bus service demand is not there yet. But people would soon know that taking 128 is more faster than what it would take to take a Service 70 bus. I waited outside Apex Tower for the 1st PM trip and a Service 70 VSO pass by, 5 mins before the 1st trip came. A SBST official was there to check out the 1st PM trip down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I rode till YMCA and there, I waited for the second trip. A few bus enthusiasts were on it. I took the route till the ending point at YCK MRT. The SAME SERVICE 70 VSO was just coming into YCK Int. I hope people would realise this service. There comes the truth; after Jubilee AMK, the bus fans had the whole bus to themselves (except an SBST official noting the passenger density in and out of the bus.) till YCK.</p>
              <p>But overall, it duplicated part of Sv 162 route till Novena.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Reaction to new bus service
              128</span></strong></p>
              <p>Commuters living in the North seem to be giving SBS Transit's
              new basic bus service 128 service to the Central Business District
              a miss, preferring to take the train.</p>
              <p>The new bus service which started this morning runs, parallel to
              half the North-South MRT line providing residents in the North with
              an alternative means of public transport to get to work.</p>
              <p>The service will have 4 trips each during the morning and
              evening peak hours.</p>
              <p>There were only 6 commuters travelling from Yio Chu Kang to the
              city area on one of the four morning peak hour trips.</p>
              <p>Most took the bus for its novelty.</p>
              <p>Among them was student Tan (not real name), a self confessed
              'bus enthusiast'.</p>
              <p>"I like to try out new services and joy ride and understand the
              demand of the service."</p>
              <p>Another commuter was Zi Yun.</p>
              <p>"This bus reaches my office, i just wanna try if it's faster or
              the same time as the train."</p>
              <p>By bus however, the length of the route takes almost thrice the
              time compared to the train.</p>
              <p>The MRT takes an estimated 26 minutes from Ang Mo Kio to Shenton
              Way while the bus service takes 74.</p>
              <p>Both modes of transport cost $1.39.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, while most commuters might value their time over
              comfort, some are willing to compromise.</p>
              <p>"If it's slightly longer and i can sit down then i'm still fine
              la but if it's maybe fifteen minutes more, i'll still prefer to
              take the train"</p>
              <p>"If i'm not in the rush of time i'll take the bus and since the
              train along north south line is usually packed i will prefer to
              take the bus as it promise me a seat. - 938Live</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually, i feel that 128 shld have a limited stop service instead of stopping long every single MRT station. Perhaps some of the stops along 128 with services to shenton way/ city could be skipped totally to improve the journey time, 1h15mins from yck to shenton way is really not attractive compared to the trains. Alternatively, have a 128A and 128B that serves alternate stations to speed up the journey.</p>

              <p>Well, the bus service demand is not there yet. But people would soon know that taking 128 is more faster than what it would take to take a Service 70 bus. I waited outside Apex Tower for the 1st PM trip and a Service 70 VSO pass by, 5 mins before the 1st trip came. A SBST official was there to check out the 1st PM trip down.</p>

              <p>I rode till YMCA and there, I waited for the second trip. A few bus enthusiasts were on it. I took the route till the ending point at YCK MRT. The SAME SERVICE 70 VSO was just coming into YCK Int. I hope people would realise this service. There comes the truth; after Jubilee AMK, the bus fans had the whole bus to themselves (except an SBST official noting the passenger density in and out of the bus.) till YCK.</p>
              <p>But overall, it duplicated part of Sv 162 route till Novena.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But, about the bus enthusiast that kena interview, I had to keep it confidential as I know who is that person and I don't want to start anymore conflict.</p>

              <p>based on your timing, it seem like Sv 70 is only 17 mins slower? despite having to stop at more stops, fetch more passengers and going a longer trip?<br>the Sin Ming reporter mention that the last morning trip took 66 mins despite only 6 paxs board /alight throughout the whole journey, excluding SBST staff and two reporters. Imagine, if there are more paxs boarding/alighting? the journey time should be more than 74 mins..</p>

              <p>Probably because 128 passes by more congested roads during peak hours. And service 70 can chiong at Nicoll Highway and at YCK Rd between ST electronics and AMK Ave 5.</p>
