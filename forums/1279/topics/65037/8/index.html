If they don't allow boarding at this terminal, then there will be no communal bus stop outside the terminal which will allow boarding on all the services starting from this terminal.<br><br>Anyway, I subscribe to tranquilice's theory that it saves time for the bus to just turn out from the terminal instead of going a loop and then out. Kent Ridge is different because the buses still have to pass by the boarding/alighting berth before leaving the terminal.</div>
