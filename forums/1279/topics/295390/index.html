It really is weird.<br><br>800's perm bendy fleet included 1114, 1200 and 1207. 1207 definitely stayed in 800 for more than 3 weeks. Perhaps half a year to one year or so. I really dont remember seeing 425 on 812 except on cameo's... same with 1131.. (could u possibly have mixed up TIB425R with TIB725A?) Plus 812 *did* start with Scania's as their AC buses, not O405 AC's. TIB812G and TIB816X was on standby *only* on svc 812's first day (never ran the route) but was subsequently moved back to 851 the very next day. They (together with TIB811J and TIB814B) only went to 812 after svc 851 received perm bendies. As for TIB975U and TIB976S, yes their first long term perm assignment was svc 812, but svc 812 did NOT receive the Hispano Mark II bendies as soon as the buses were pressed into service. They were on the AMDEP Bt Panjang / CCK services for a week or two initially.</div>

It really is weird.<br><br>800's perm bendy fleet included 1114, 1200 and 1207. 1207 definitely stayed in 800 for more than 3 weeks. Perhaps half a year to one year or so. I really dont remember seeing 425 on 812 except on cameo's... same with 1131.. (could u possibly have mixed up TIB425R with TIB725A?) Plus 812 *did* start with Scania's as their AC buses, not O405 AC's. TIB812G and TIB816X was on standby *only* on svc 812's first day (never ran the route) but was subsequently moved back to 851 the very next day. They (together with TIB811J and TIB814B) only went to 812 after svc 851 received perm bendies. As for TIB975U and TIB976S, yes their first long term perm assignment was svc 812, but svc 812 did NOT receive the Hispano Mark II bendies as soon as the buses were pressed into service. They were on the AMDEP Bt Panjang / CCK services for a week or two initially. </div></blockquote>You still living in Yishun?

However Svc 851 was the first service in Yishun to receive perm bendies (171 only had TIB838H for a small while). Svc 854 received bendies only after Svc 851 did. First FAC service in Yishun was service 855.
