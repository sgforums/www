So 426 is definitely new new AMDEP. As for 425, I think it went to KJDEP for route service. 425 was rego'ed TIB0000W in AMDEP during its preflight check period (about a week or two - pun intended by the technicians? W is never a valid rego check digit) before the official rego was slapped on it. As for 427, I do believe it is also new new AMDEP. At least 428 was. 428 served on svc 854 on its first route day.<br><br>As for 279 and 280.. you really really have to check your records man... really. They really started new new on service 167. Service 950 is not even existent when 279 and 280 were rolled into service  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>279 and 280 were subsequently switched over to 850.. then shortly after that to 852. It is only then when service 950 was inaugurated. And even then, service 852 on and off still have 279 and/or 280 on it running as AC buses (with its aircon turned off and windows opened at other times in other services). It was then finally decided that 279 and 280 be moved to service 950, and the move was officially announced in poster in all 852 bus stops.</div>

I suppose they dont clean the interior except for sweeping the floor. Full interior cleanups did happen twice though. The first time was when TIBS took over the BPJ services. They didnt have enough new new buses to go to 5/75/171/177/179/184/343/344 etc etc (not enough new O405's) so they plucked a good number of UD's and Hino's over e.g. some of the buses in the TIB265K to TIB310M range to go over. Since these were really old buses and they didnt want the BPJ commuters to think that TIBS shortchanged them with old buses, they repainted every surface new for these about-to-be-scrapped buses <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> including the wheel rims, all interior walls (white paint), and polished the poles.<br><br>The second full interior cleanup happened during the SARS period. More as an effort to convince the public that the buses are clean and hygenic I think. I remember seeing TIB1126Y on 812 looking sparkling new when it was already a few months into service.<br><br>Service 178 was one of Woodland's premium services 20 years ago, as was 852 for Yishun.

Dennis Lances hardly match up to the O405's in terms of ride comfort. Lances are the lowest ranked buses in AMDEP other than the UD's. But it is more than that.

The DAF's are actually better than the Lances - at least the suspensions packs more spring.<br><br>In terms of the current "secondary" buses in TIBS/SMRT, I rank them in the following order:<br><br>1. WA Strider Scania<br>2. Elbo Scania<br>3. WA Setanta DAF<br>4. Volgren Lance<br>5. Volgren Hino<br>6. DM Lance<br>7. UD<br><br>However on some days I may actually still prefer to board a UD than a Lance simply because a UD has many many more seats than a Lance. I rank the UD's lowest simply because they are old and unmaintained... when they are new, I think they can challenge even the DAF's.</div>
