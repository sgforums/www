            <div class='col-md body'>I could only remember 1224Y first time when I sat it somewhere 2003 on 188. After which it was all along on 188 until 189 started introducing bendies in early 2006. Slightly before that period it had been spare bus. It should have been under KJDEP all the while, lest my memories are not to accurate.<br><strong>[Warning: Slightly off topic, do not continue if you are bounded by time]</strong><br>Although not first deployment, but as I could remember, ex-KJDEP buses of service 989 were 432U, 436J and 479K which were transferred to other depots after the service was withdrawn, while the others stayed in KJDEP and 'helped' out other services.<br>As memories held, 475X went to 189 after which to 67, 492X and 547Y went to 188, 493T went to 176, although info on sgwiki indicated 61 first, 520Z went immediately to 189 and stayed ever since, 521X, 537B, 539X, 611U and 800R went to 106 and stayed there as well. 543H went to 190, 591T went to 925 first, then spare and now serving multiple roles as shuttle and regular buses. 600B and 608E went over to 67, 605M served 189 for quite a while before going over to 176. 792E, which was seen many times on 989, cannot be confirmed as a perm and so is left out of this picture. Hino, DAF and Volgren Merc were some of those which also served on the route as cameos.<br>And for those interested, there was actually a Habit 'serving' on 989 on the first day! Although the exact details whether it entered Changi International PTB or even ran the entire route is still sketchy, the rego can be certain and still can be found on the TIBS news magazine in the National Library.<br>The bus is <span style="color: white;"><strong>TIB1133B (KJ 106)</strong></span><br>Have fun!</div>

TIB811J and TIB814B went from 812 to 804 and then from there to other services since. TIB819M and TIB820H served on service 812 - they were the last AMDEP perm rigids to serve on service 812 before it went full bendy. From there they went to service 171. Whether they did 811 perm in between I am not sure, but I dont think so. I havent seen them on 171 lately so i dun think they are still on service 171. Maybe because I have not been to Yishun Interchange often enough for the last 4 years already. Been walking out to Ave 2 bus stop or to Khatib MRT.</div>
