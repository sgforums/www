( in case not posted) what are the other 3 buses with AC in 1988 before this 950 hinos come about adding to the AC fleet?<br><br>ZYX<br></div></blockquote>No other voithed ones that I know of. BTW the Voiths in 335S and 336P were also largely speculation. The biggest clue or giveaway was that these two buses had the characteristic Voith whistle upon braking. They aceleration sounded different from ZF's too, and did not have the characteristic ZF catcall upon braking.<br><br>TIB279X and TIB280R were the two AC TIBS buses. The other 3 belonged to CSS - CSS267L, CSS268J and CSS269G. CSS269G differed from the TIBS Hino HT238 OAC's on 950 because 269G had a single piece rear windscreen while the TIBS ones had a 3-piece each. These 5 were all OAC, although they looked like CAC because their windows can be opened.</div>
