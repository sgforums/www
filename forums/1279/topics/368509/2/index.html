              <p>There is way to play them though. Since they are unreasonable, then you shall follow ALL LAWS, 50km/h on the roads, 30km/h near junctions and 20km/h entering bus stop. but you'll sure lambat until very jia lat. If more BCs do that, their service frequency will sure die. If the routemaster were to question you again, you said that he was the one who told you to stop at all bus stops REGARDLESS of whether there are any people at the bus stop and therefore messing up the frequency, think he might want to take back his words. For sure, such actions will sure make them lengthen the runtime for the service, which will sure be irritating by commuters, especially those rushing. Law by law, you won't be at fault, but make sure that they're disadvantaged by your law by law actions.</p>
              <p>IMO, it's like a cycle among the government, company and commuters.</p>
              <p>1) LTA: Safety rules, encourage people to take public transport<br>2) SBST: Apply safety rules and lenghten runtime, therefore, slow journey<br>3) Commuters: Complain that the journey is very slow, they rather they drive.<br>4) LTA: Try to pursue those pax to continue public transport<br>etc</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, looks like they are failing themselves. Car, expensive. Trains aren't too comfortable too ride on. Bus too slow. Leave cycling and walking out. Are they training our patience? I won't be surprised to see crazy people outside there telling people about politics like what I experienced on 490U, Sv52.</p>

              <p>I remember the VS stop at Marine Parade need not be called by buses other than those that loop at Siglap. So, 196, 197, 31, etc. won't stop there.</p>
              <p>Some BCs would unofficially allow boarding/alighting at that stop though ( I remember 196, and that time there was no AVLS, so no automatic fare stage updating. so can tap at the fare stage of the stop before that)</p>
              <p>now they have made that stop to include all services. probably due to  complaints by those who feel that stop should not be skipped. but the previous stop is not very far away - probably the reason it was skipped intially, just like how some alternate stops are skipped along Orchard Rd etc.</p>

              <p>There is way to play them though. Since they are unreasonable,
              then you shall follow ALL LAWS, 50km/h on the roads, 30km/h near
              junctions and 20km/h entering bus stop. but you'll sure lambat
              until very jia lat. If more BCs do that, their service frequency
              will sure die. If the routemaster were to question you again, you
              said that he was the one who told you to stop at all bus stops
              REGARDLESS of whether there are any people at the bus stop and
              therefore messing up the frequency, think he might want to take
              back his words. For sure, such actions will sure make them lengthen
              the runtime for the service, which will sure be irritating by
              commuters, especially those rushing. Law by law, you won't be at
              fault, but make sure that they're disadvantaged by your law by law
              actions.</p>
              <p>IMO, it's like a cycle among the government, company and
              commuters.</p>
              <p>1) LTA: Safety rules, encourage people to take public
              transport<br> 2) SBST: Apply safety rules and lenghten runtime, therefore, slow
              journey<br> 3) Commuters: Complain that the journey is very slow, they rather
              they drive.<br> 4) LTA: Try to pursue those pax to continue public transport<br> etc</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, looks like they are failing themselves. Car,
              expensive. Trains aren't too comfortable too ride on. Bus too slow.
              Leave cycling and walking out. Are they training our patience? I
              won't be surprised to see crazy people outside there telling people
              about politics like what I experienced on 490U, Sv52.</p>

              <p>Best excuse - A/C auto-climate cannot adjust. Corp Comms announced it publicly before, so just let her suck thumb.</p>
              <p>Though occasionally it's not the A/C that is at fault. The first OC Batch II I boarded the first time, I saw missing screws and the A/C cover partially open (though not obvious) - the temp sensor went crazy and the priority seats were just freezing. Not sure if the SL I told manage to get it fixed though.</p>
