              <p>Today some auntie around 50-60s came up my bus and asked whether
              she can transfer to service 851. As i know, my service doesnt see
              851 so i just told her my bus doesnt see 851 at all. I'm around
              5-6minutes late and pple becoming more n more already so i
              didnt want to talk so much with her since she wont be taking my bus
              anyway. Then she ask me WHICH service at that particular stop
              allows her to transfer to 851. I told her im not sure(how would i
              be sure? im not a resident there n not from SMRT). Then she went on
              to give some slow n unlinked comments abt going to some swimming
              complex etc to find 851 which i wasnt paying much attention as im
              running late n i know she isnt taking my bus. I just told her im
              not sure. She politely said she will go ask somewhere else. My DDU
              became -7(lambat 7 minutes) aft she left.</p>
              <p>Before i closed the door, she told someone outside loudly in
              mandarin, saying "driving on the road also dont know, ben dan
              de(stupid)"</p>
              <p>Maybe i wasnt particularly polite as i was very late, but i sure
              wasnt that rude to her. I did look at her as she was asking
              questions n even though i gave one word answers, i didnt shout at
              her.</p>
              <p>How in the hell would i know abt SMRT bus services? Somemore im
              not a resident there, i'm not so sure. Later i tell her wrongly she
              also will scold. Don't know also a SIN? And driving must know all
              the surrounding places? Drivers r suppose to concentrate on the
              road, not on surrounding areas.</p>

              <p>Fight for your rights? Every BC were to fight for rights at any passenger who "assult" them, then the bus no need to continue the journey? Then passengers will fight for their rights. BC continue to lambat? Being in service industry, be it Bus captain or not, patience and tolerance are attitudes that they shoud carry. Double_Decker is just sharing his story that he encounter. You do not need to side him till send her lawyer letter, what a joke man.</p>
              <p>If BCs don't provide route information then who will provide to those who can't read english and needs help? You think the all the people who take buses are bus fans? I am sure all BCs are willing to help those who needs help, in the case that the BC does not know. There's nothing he can do about it and to call the passenger to ask others.</p>
              <p>It's only 7min, he should be able to chase it back if he's able to. At least chase back a few minutes so that he has enough break time.</p>

              Today, an ah lian with a xialan-faced-BF or brother brought a large transparent cup of coffee or i-dont-even-know-what-shit-drink-with-a-thick-straw onto my bus. I didnt say anything, and she didnt look at me, so i didnt bother about her. I could not see where she was seated from my mirror.
              
              When i reached the interchange, i saw her walking to the exit door, without her fucking cup. Since i did not know where she was seated(hence not knowing where she left it), i did not want to go behind to search for the cup and make her pick it up(wasting time).
              
              As i expected, i saw the fucking cup on the floor when i check the bus after parking it. I was angry and took a photograph of it.
              
              She probably wouldnt be so lucky if she met the 2792K indian BC of service 38. What a ch** b** ah lian. Parents never teach one.(And i purposely want to scold the parents because i am no saint. I am equally guai lan)
              
              SBST should start catching such people to do Corrective Work Order. Make them go to depot at 3am to WASH BUSES.

              <p>some people are just terrible. give them chance to bring a drink into the bus not enough. still wanna litter. these same people will complain abt others who mess up the cleanliness of the bus. maybe you all need to implement rules like the SMRT trains. u can see that the MRTs and its stations are squeeky clean 99% of the time.</p>

              <p>You want Singapore's transportation system to become trash is it? Good lorh, if BCs and SLs everyday fight for their rights in every single little thing, then wat u think will happen? I am not saying the BC should keep silent or wad, but don't you think that as part of the transporation and "service" industry, these things would definitely happen?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Want Singapore transport system to be like Paris? Almost everyday bus drivers and train drivers go on "strike"... Good lorh, like this "fight for your rights", at the convenience of the entire system...</p>

              <p>Today, an ah lian with a xialan-faced-BF or brother brought a large transparent cup of coffee or i-dont-even-know-what-shit-drink-with-a-thick-straw onto my bus. I didnt say anything, and she didnt look at me, so i didnt bother about her. I could not see where she was seated from my mirror.</p>
              <p>When i reached the interchange, i saw her walking to the exit door, without her fucking cup. Since i did not know where she was seated(hence not knowing where she left it), i did not want to go behind to search for the cup and make her pick it up(wasting time).</p>
              <p>As i expected, i saw the fucking cup on the floor when i check the bus after parking it. I was angry and took a photograph of it.</p>
              <p>She probably wouldnt be so lucky if she met the 2792K indian BC of service 38. What a ch<strong>* b</strong>* ah lian. Parents never teach one.(And i purposely want to scold the parents because i am no saint. I am equally guai lan)</p>
