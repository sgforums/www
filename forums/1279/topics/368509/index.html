              <p>Admin's note - this is a thread for bus drviers to post some of the experinces they have... Pls adhere to the guidlines .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As i have said in the introduction thread, i am actually a BC with SBST for 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>Something happened last night made me really angry. For 2.5 years, i've more or less seen many unreasonable pax, but this incident last night nearly made me want to beat up the pax. Please allow me to complain.</p>
              <p>I was driving a DD for P shift. At around 11.15pm, my last trip, i reached the Hua Xin Court bus stop along Marine Parade. I realised no one was at the bus stop and no one wanted to alight, so i naturally just skip the stop, travelling ard 30-40 km/h as i do so(which is slow).</p>
              <p>As my bus go over the bus bay(the furthest end), this man, quite old, suddenly appeared n flag for my bus. My natural instinct is obviously to slow down even more n try to stop the bus for him. However, i realised that i can no longer steer into the bus bay since i already go over the furthest end. I wanted to just ignore him since there was no way i can stop safely(my only other option is to stop on the road, which isnt allowed according to law). Suddenly this old man threw something at my bus, which I believe is some tiny stone from the road. When he did that, my instinct is to stop immediately upon hearing the loud sound. So i did. I opened the door for him and he boarded.</p>
              <p>This was what he said,</p>
              <p>"YOU NEVER STOP AR!"</p>
              <p>"Sorry."  I replied. But i didnt think i was wrong anyway. Just saying it as a SOP.</p>
              <p>"WHAT SORRY! U RUSHING FOR BLOODY FUNERAL AR!"</p>
              <p>I immediately got angry and turn around to stare at him as he made his way to the green seat. He turned and stare at me, and then i ignored him n continued my journey.</p>
              <p>I was furious abt this incident. I wasnt really at fault to start with and i said sorry as well. He still got the cheek to scold?! I already let him board the bus AGAINST THE LAW by stopping outside bus bay. What more does he want?!</p>
              <p>Sorry for the long story. I had to get it off my chest. Passenger nowadays really too much le.</p>
              <p>I wasnt rushing for time by the way. I was ahead of schdule.</p>

              <p>forgive and forget :)</p>
              <p>besides, the uncle , and most paxs don't really know BC's job scope and SOPs. So they naturally will assume they are the passengers (im the biggest mindset). So usually when dealing with passengers who post about BCs and buses being this and that in this forum i usually post -&gt; <strong>You try to be a BC first before coming back to post more. </strong></p>

              <p>Since your bus was over the bus bay, for safety, I felt that you didn't need to stop, even if he throw something at the bus.</p>
              <p>Just on Tuesday afternoon, I witnessed this incident:</p>
              <p>A service 162 WAB (didn't take down rego) just pulled out of the bus stop outside Hub Synergy Point (along Anson Rd) and turned into the next lane (2nd lane from the left). The traffic light was red. Then there was a woman rushing across the traffic light crossing from M hotel, she knocked at the bus doors to alert the BC, but then the BC didn't open the door as the bus was already out of the bus stop. She continued knocking until the traffic light almost turned green and then the BC opened the doors.</p>
