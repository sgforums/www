              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you had read properly, the 55 people scenairo was a
              <strong>if</strong> (I suppose you don't need me to explain this
              word), and was done to show how inefficient double deckers are when
              there is a full load, the purpose is to show the flow, for a full
              bendy would have more choices to take when it comes to
              alighting.</p>
              <p>In any bus, passengers would move in if there is a huge
              space left by those who have alighted, and if they don't, prompting
              from the drivers will encourage them to do so. On a bendy, the
              alighting passengers take lesser time to alight, and therefore
              whoever's supposed to move further in to the empty
              spaces are <strong>able</strong> to move in at an earlier time
              (lets say its time <strong>a</strong>) as compared to a
              double deck, and consequently, whoever's boarding can board earlier
              (lets say its time <strong>b</strong>) than if it was a
              DD.</p>
              <p>On a double deck, because the alighting passengers who are the
              last to alight (usually) come from the upper deck, and that they
              take longer to alight, people who want to move in or upstrairs can
              only do so later (lets say its time <strong>c</strong>), which
              means people who want to board can only board later (lets say its
              time <strong>d</strong>)</p>
              <p>Here <strong>a&lt;c</strong> and <strong>b&lt;d.</strong></p>
              <p>And all this is before considering the fact that people may not
              move upstrairs because they are alighting in a few stops.</p>
              <p>If there weren't a lot of people alighting from the upper deck
              of those buses at CCK, there wouldn't be a jam and I wouldn't
              mention it. But there is, so I think it is still better for you to
              go there and see for yourself. Yes DDs may have the front doors
              available for alighting at interchanges, but it doesn't really
              speed things up by a lot, because it is still one line from the
              upper deck to the lower deck, and having to walk from the stairs to
              the front door takes a slightly longer time. And thanks for
              pointing out, bendies also have an extra set of doors for alighting
              at the interchanges.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>you are basing on the fact IF there is full alighting of the 55 people on the upper deck with significant boarding activities as well...how many bus stops have such situation whereby all 55 paxes will alight at the same stop?</p>
              <p>the example given by you at NP/Sim bus stops are out of the scenarios right now...</p>
              <p>further based on the actual number of paxes alighting, the dwell time at bus stop wont be 100% more for DDs.. that is a fact...</p>
              <p>and back to your "<strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;">a&lt;c</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;"> and </span><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;">b&lt;d.",  </strong><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> this is technically correct, but i have also pointed that the no of DD that can stop at a bus stop compare to a bendy...so u need to take into consideration that as well (and for bus stops with no significant boarding/alighting activities),  so if 3 DD pull into a bus stop and pick up /alight 5 paxes and each bus stop for 20 sec, so 15  paxes were clear from the bus stop in 20 sec.. but if 3 bendies go into the bus stop and pick up/alight 5 paxes and each bus stop for 20 sec, the last bendy will only leave the bus stop 40 sec later (thus holding up traffic on main road for 20 sec).... pls do consider this fact as well... </span></p>
              <p>as for the CCK situation, you are saying that all the DD are full when arriving at CCK interchange? how can it be? tot those bendies keep saying that the DD wont have much ppl going up stair when travelling short distance? now you are painting a picture that all DDs are fully loaded at the upper deck when reaching CCK, thus causing all the delay.</p>

              <p>Lesser feeders, precisely the point. Why are areas managed by
              TIBS/SMRT having so many feeders for a residential town (8 in
              Woodlands &amp; 6 in Yishun), while certain areas managed by SBST
              that are of the similar population density as Woodlands/Yishun have
              only 4-5 feeder services?</p>
              <p>For a start, more feeder mergers to form routes like sv3/38/60
              should be conducted.</p>

              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Thats only one matter.</p>
              <p>There is also the need to intro more point-to-point. Like 161 and 168.</p>
              <p>This effectively removes H&amp;S and allows for DDs, as well as bus resources, to be well used.</p>

              <p>Problem for 67 now it is spammed with a hell lots of A22s..Might as well cut 3 SDs and put just 1 DD to perform..Reduce 2 split duties for weekdays,Most of the time during peak hours,Buses from either depots loves to follow each others which result in less loadings and bunchings..Today at Tampines around 1816hrs only 3 A22s,1 bendy and 1 DD enter int at an average of 5 mins!.969 face overcrowding issues again and i see 2-3 A22s really cant cope with the paxs around 1800-1830hrs</p>

              <p>Anyone who wish to take the DD on 172, i have posted the timings for this duty in another thread before :)</p>
