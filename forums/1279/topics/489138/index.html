              <p>In a given space of 36 m, yes you will have space for 3 DDs and 2 bendies. Based on the absolute space taken, the DDs win, but a stationary bus is a sitting duck. When you take into account of the flow, you will realise more pax can be cleared with a bendy.</p>
              <p>Based on observations, bendies take less than half the time of DDs dwelling at busy bus stops, having similar and significant boarding and alighting activities. Using simple, easy to calculate numbers, the calculation is as follows:</p>
              <p>In a given 6 minutes time frame, and 36 m space. As you have said 3 DDs OR 2 bendies can fit into the space. But lets simply assume a bendy takes half the time (in fact, in reality, more often than not it takes less than half) of a DD. And for simplicity sake, lets assume a double deck takes 3 mins (at stops like NP and SIM, 5 mins is not unheard of), and a bendy takes 1.5 mins. Ie each DD space can be used by 2 DDs in 6 mins and each bendy space can be used by 4 bendies in 6 mins.</p>
              <p>You could fit 3 DDs x 2 buses per space OR 2 bendies x 4 buses per space.</p>
              <p>So in a given 6 minutes time frame, you could fit 6 DDs OR 8 bendies.</p>
              <p>The above calculation was deliberately made simple, but it can be extrapolated to fit different dwelling times.</p>

              <p>That is some stupid calculation. Sorry to say that but your thoughts here are not realistic.</p>
              <p>If 179 was bendies at Pioneer MRT stop, and coming at 02-03 min frequency like 179.. first of all it would create a queue of buses to just call at the stop (take into consideration there is also 241, 255, 257 calling at this stop). This would not just delay 179 but also all other buses because the bendies would hog the stop.</p>

              <p>oh really? but someone (not u) seem to say that bendies wont have bunching issue if they are deploy on sv179......or any other service with good frequency....(cos it is DDs who are holding up at the bus stops, thus causing all the bunching).Bendies does not hold up at bus stop and thus no bunching.....but then 5 x912 bendies right after interchange should not happen at all since bendies are so efficent in clearing loads at bus stops...</p>

              <p>In the same respect, your explanation doesn't consider the traffic congestion caused by a double deck acting like a sitting duck at a bus stop.</p>
              <p>Sure, not all stops will see bendies taking 1/2 the time, for example, stops where one or two pax are alighting, then yes, it will take the same time. And sure, not 100% of the time, as there may be different passenger behaviours, but in general, if you have a sizable crowd (more than 10), you would realise the bendies unload way faster. And when you see busy bus stops, thats where it drops below 50% of the time taken by a DD.</p>
              <p>The flow is simple, and I have explained it before, there is just one entrance on both bendies and double decks, but the double decks have a choke point at the bottom of the staircase, where people boarding will have to wait for people coming down from the upper deck to alight, and only two lanes of flow to exit, of which there is only one lane of passengers from the upper deck (even if all 55 people want to alight at the same time, they will have to form a line before coming down the stairs).  And also, the walk from most of the upper deck to the exit is a long one in terms of time taken (vis a vis a bendy) and both climbing up and down the stairs take additional time. So people get stuck waiting for people to come down, even if they are just going to the rear of the lower deck, and if they do want to go upstairs, they will have to form a queue to go up, slows everything down.</p>
              <p>On a bendy, you just have to walk from the seats to the doors, which are less than half the length of a 12m from the seats, and there are four distinct lines that can be formed and while sometimes there may be a wait at the exits, it isn't a long wait, usually a few seconds before you get to pass it, especially as there is a standing area opposite the door which allows pax who've just boarded to overtake the exiting pax.</p>
              <p>I would recommend you to see a situation where congestion have been caused by double decks where previously didn't exist. Go to CCK Int during peak now, especially in the morning. Previously with bendies only, there wasn't that much of a jam (just a short wait, if there is any), now with the double decks there is a jam, and a long wait when a double deck is in front of you occupying the alighting berth even if there was no jam, and if you actually look at how slow people are coming down the deckers at the alighting berth, you'd see the clearer picture as to why there is a jam. Meanwhile the bendies really take less than 1/2 the amount of time there as compared to double decks, the bendies in this case, literally come and go.</p>
              <p>Same situation at the first pair of bus stops at Bukit Panjang after BKE, double decks which just dwell at the bus stops. While bendies just take less than half the time to unload and load.</p>

              <p>lack of parking spaces? so one more reason to have less bendy..... double decker blocking at interchange causing 5 x912 to be bunch? are u sure? why dun you say bendies blocking in WDL interchange causing these buses to be bunch?</p>

              <p>In the same respect, your explanation doesn't consider the
              traffic congestion caused by a double deck acting like
              a sitting duck at a bus stop.</p>
              <p>Sure, not all stops will see bendies taking 1/2 the time, for
              example, stops where one or two pax are alighting, then yes, it
              will take the same time. And sure, not 100% of the time, as there
              may be different passenger behaviours, but in general, if you have
              a sizable crowd (more than 10), you would realise the bendies
              unload way faster. And when you see busy bus stops, thats where it
              drops below 50% of the time taken by a DD.</p>
              <p>The flow is simple, and I have explained it before, there is
              just one entrance on both bendies and double decks, but the double
              decks have a choke point at the bottom of the staircase, where
              people boarding will have to wait for people coming down from the
              upper deck to alight, and only two lanes of flow to exit, of which
              there is only one lane of passengers from the upper deck (even
              if all 55 people want to alight at the same time, they will have to
              form a line before coming down the stairs).  And also, the
              walk from most of the upper deck to the exit is a long one in
              terms of time taken (vis a vis a bendy) and both climbing
              up and down the stairs take additional time. So people
              get stuck waiting for people to come down, even if they are just
              going to the rear of the lower deck, and if they do want to go
              upstairs, they will have to form a queue to go up, slows everything
              down.</p>
              <p>On a bendy, you just have to walk from the seats
              to the doors, which are less than half the length of a 12m from the
              seats, and there are four distinct lines that can be
              formed and while sometimes there may be a wait at
              the exits, it isn't a long wait, usually a few seconds before you
              get to pass it, especially as there is a standing area opposite the
              door which allows pax who've just boarded to overtake the
              exiting pax.</p>
              <p>I would recommend you to see a situation where congestion have
              been caused by double decks where previously didn't exist. Go to
              CCK Int during peak now, especially in the morning. Previously with
              bendies only, there wasn't that much of a jam (just a short wait,
              if there is any), now with the double decks there is a jam, and a
              long wait when a double deck is in front of you occupying the
              alighting berth even if there was no jam, and if you actually
              look at how slow people are coming down the deckers at the
              alighting berth, you'd see the clearer picture as to why there is a
              jam. Meanwhile the bendies really take less than 1/2 the amount of
              time there as compared to double decks, the bendies in this case,
              literally come and go.</p>
              <p>Same situation at the first pair of bus stops at
              Bukit Panjang after BKE, double decks which just dwell at the bus
              stops. While bendies just take less than half the time to unload
              and load.</p>

              <p>so how many bus stops have such situation whereby 55 paxes are alighting and another 55 paxes want to board the same bus? are u saying that every bus stop, there will be the same boarding activities (all the 55 paxes from upper deck will alight and another 55 will go to upper deck?).. further, if a bendy is packed, you think it is easy for the paxes to alight and board as well? still have to wait for the paxes to alight first, before the paxes inside the buses can move in before BC open the front entrance.. so the time is roughly the same... you are assuming that the BC will open the front entrance and there is space between the entrance/exit for the paxes to board....</p>
              <p>further, how many DDs are causing traffic congestion acting like a sitting duck? are u talking about the NP bus stop?  i usually saw bendy causing congestion, because the tail end protrude out on the lane, thus all car behind cant pass at all... </p>

              <p>HK is no utopia but Singapore should have lessons from them
                  about point-to-point bus routes. LTA should eradicate the hub and
                  spoke model we are using now. There's simply no logic in squeezing
                  in more services into already overcrowded bus interchanges, in fact
                  it should be the opposite, LTA should build more numerous but
                  smaller bus terminals, even roadside ones to decentralize the bus
                  network as well as allowing them the opportunity to modify bus
                  services to serve areas that have not been well served. If LTA
                  continues to press on with the hub and spoke model, it will just
                  explode in all of our faces in a few years time, especially when we
                  are massively increasing the amount of buses on our roads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, if we do indeed transition to a more point-to-point bus
                  system, it is unlikely we will need bendy buses. HK doesn't need
                  bendy buses because of their point-to-point bus network and also
                  because they don't have many feeder/intra-town style routes. Unlike
                  LTA, they don't try to cram entire trainloads of people onto feeder
                  and intra-town buses at each station.</p>

              <p>This was EXACTLY my point...</p>
              <p>Some are just plain stubborn to recognise this...</p>
              <p>And to these ppl I say this: You all dont want bendy so much right?! Can... Scrap hub-and-spoke and encourage long-distance travel by introducing more point-to-point! Whats the damn problem with that? This is giving all commuters benefits! Instead of spamming more feeders and in turn causing bottlenecks IN the bus with DDs!</p>
              <p>There has to be an opportunity cost somewhere!</p>
              <p>And to those asking me to join LTA... I ask you then, you come forum for what sia... Voice opinion also not happy... Who ever said that an opinion must make "legitimate sense", or at least to your own petty standards? I hope to hear more than this simplistic and dismissive response.</p>

              <p>If you had read properly, the 55 people scenairo was a <strong>if</strong> (I suppose you don't need me to explain this word), and was done to show how inefficient double deckers are when there is a full load, the purpose is to show the flow, for a full bendy would have more choices to take when it comes to alighting.</p>
              <p>In any bus, passengers would move in if there is a huge space left by those who have alighted, and if they don't, prompting from the drivers will encourage them to do so. On a bendy, the alighting passengers take lesser time to alight, and therefore whoever's supposed to move further in to the empty spaces are <strong>able</strong> to move in at an earlier time (lets say its time <strong>a</strong>) as compared to a double deck, and consequently, whoever's boarding can board earlier (lets say its time <strong>b</strong>) than if it was a DD.</p>
              <p>On a double deck, because the alighting passengers who are the last to alight (usually) come from the upper deck, and that they take longer to alight, people who want to move in or upstrairs can only do so later (lets say its time <strong>c</strong>), which means people who want to board can only board later (lets say its time <strong>d</strong>)</p>
              <p>Here <strong>a&lt;c</strong> and <strong>b&lt;d.</strong></p>
              <p>And all this is before considering the fact that people may not move upstrairs because they are alighting in a few stops.</p>
              <p>If there weren't a lot of people alighting from the upper deck of those buses at CCK, there wouldn't be a jam and I wouldn't mention it. But there is, so I think it is still better for you to go there and see for yourself. Yes DDs may have the front doors available for alighting at interchanges, but it doesn't really speed things up by a lot, because it is still one line from the upper deck to the lower deck, and having to walk from the stairs to the front door takes a slightly longer time. And thanks for pointing out, bendies also have an extra set of doors for alighting at the interchanges.</p>

              <p>The thing is, in Woodlands, berths can accomodate both bendies and double deck, and only one bus at a time. With the increase in use of double decks, you see them taking the berth for a longer time, meaning other buses will have to queue up before they can use them. And how has lack of parking spaces got to do with bendies vs double decks? Do you think double decks don't face parking issues?</p>
