              <p>Yes also have to consider between few years back and now there has been quite a few fleet add to the service. 961 used to operate with 26 buses, now operates with 32 buses in the last 3 years. </p>
              <p>Having said it, 961 is such a long route that by the time it starts in peak in one part of the country, it is already off-peak by the time it reaches Bukit Merah region. Mandai estate is the reason why 961 is still packed in AM at Kranji but there is 160/170/178/960 to complement as well. Really depends on who comes first.</p>

              <p>What's the loading pattern like though, are there many that take long journeys on 961? If it's mainly short-distance demands, it could make sense to split the route up to cater to the crowds separately. There's DTL/CCL to bridge the centre section as well.</p>

              <p>Doing long loops like these are damaging to BCs. I'd rather not.</p>
              <p>In fact, considering 173's poor demand, why not do a mix-and-match? So we have 961 doing Woodlands - Beauty World - Clementi, and 173 doing Bt Batok - Beauty World - Lor 1 Geylang.</p>
              <p>If need be, can amend 173 to do 852's route via BB East Ave 4/6, Old Jurong Rd, Upp Bt Timah Rd to reduce the loop. Hillview estate can be covered by 176/177, and Hume Ave by 178. Or both by a new short trunk.</p>

              <p>No amount of bendy buses will solve the isuue, but at least a bigger bus with more seats will appease a lot of the passengers instead of fully loaded 12m buses after a long wait. Of course it would be wise to break the routes up, but LTA has to take into consideration the links that will be lost.</p>

              <p>3585/2586/3590/3591 are still appearing on 857? Or it seems so from my last ride on 857 a couple of weeks ago. Not sure about 5071 though.</p>
              <p>5076 seen on 857 often too. Wonder what's 854's actual DD fleet now.</p>
