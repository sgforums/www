              <p>This was EXACTLY my point...</p>
              <p>Some are just plain stubborn to recognise this...</p>
              <p>And to these ppl I say this: You all dont want bendy so much
              right?! Can... Scrap hub-and-spoke and encourage long-distance
              travel by introducing more point-to-point! Whats the damn problem
              with that? This is giving all commuters benefits! Instead of
              spamming more feeders and in turn causing bottlenecks IN the bus
              with DDs!</p>
              <p>There has to be an opportunity cost somewhere!</p>
              <p>And to those asking me to join LTA... I ask you then, you come
              forum for what sia... Voice opinion also not happy... Who ever said
              that an opinion must make "legitimate sense", or at least to your
              own petty standards? I hope to hear more than this simplistic and
              dismissive response.</p>

              <p>I saw 2 Enviros on 964 today.1 is the usual SMB3567Y but i also
              saw another one.Why i said 2 is because one had appeared opposite
              Admiralty MRT and then it went off towards Woodlands Mart and not
              long after SMB3567Y came.Therefore the bus i spotted earlier could
              not have been SMB3567Y as it would not have looped so fast</p>

              <p>Now already sign that rail network will breakdown anytime and i
              guessed its a good cow sense knocking on their head that we cant
              100% rely on rail.If you ask me to do bus planning,I would gladly
              scrap the feeder network and replace with trunk service,Peak hour
              express service and bus parrallel service compliment the rail
              line.But LTA is so stubborn that they need to continue the feeder
              bus legacy to compliment the MRT.</p>
              <p>My defination of short trunk(1-10km) acting as a so called
              feeder also</p>
              <p>Medium trunk(10-20km) and long trunk(21km above).</p>
              <p>Express service would operate between 0630-0830 &amp; 1700-2000
              during weekdays and 0630-1330 for Saturdays(Excl PHs).This way the
              DDs will be fully utilise even for short trunks(Lower deck for
              short and upper deck for longer distance).A24s can be use for short

              <p>Precisely to your point coz SBST has trunks catering as feeders within the towns. For instance Tampines: heavily populated town</p>

              <p>72 acts like feeder for Tampines Ave 6/9</p>
              <p>27/168 act like feeder for Tampines Ave 9/10</p>
              <p>39 acts like feeder for all of Tampines Ave 2 (not covered by 292 entirely)</p>
              <p>22 acts like feeder for Tampines Ave 4 (not covered by 293 entirely)</p>
              <p>23 acts like feeder for Tampines Ave 1</p>
