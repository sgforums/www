              <p>So rumour say 3616 is the 201st Enviro.</p>
              <p>Assuming 201 units total, means 116 BSEP and 85 non-BSEP.</p>
              <p>Wonder about A95 coming in... how many? Will there be any

              <p>So that means the production batch DDs have already been registered as it has already reached 5085... and BSEP only 07 more units... and then done!</p>

              <p>171 do need DDs.. I saw the loading is quite high from Yishun Ave 5 / Sembawang road towards BPJ.. even within BPJ town bus exited with 60+ pax to Upper Bukit Timah road. When I observed the loading, I realised that 171 is the only service connecting Yishun / BPJ area to Upper Bukit Timah / Bukit Timah road... Hence, though I was also suggesting earlier, I now don't think 171 will be cut short to BPJ/CCK area even after DTL2.. as sizeable number of pax take it to Upper Bukit Timah from BPJ area...</p>
              <p>The best could be that 171 goes via 961 route to terminate at Lor 1... and 961 loops at Beauty World, given that 170 is parallel. This is my suggestion.</p>

              <p>I don't know if trees are trimmed along the sector of Mandai Rd from Mandai Ave to Sembawang Rd. That should be the limiting factor for 138. And Mandai Lake Rd also seems to have low-lying trees so I doubt 138 and 927 will get DDs.</p>
              <p>It would be nice for 138 to get DDs, though.</p>

              <p>No. Letting 171 copy 961's route would add another 7km to the route, making the total 40+ km, and that's really not considerate of BCs. I doubt LTA would do that either.</p>
              <p>Bt Panjang MRT to Bt Timah Rd / Dunearn Rd has 67, 170, 171, 961, 970, though only 171 serves the Bt Panjang interior.</p>
              <p>Suppose if the link from Yishun - Dunearn Rd is to be preserved, then a plausible suggestion would be to divert 171 after Dunearn Rd to Sixth Ave / Holland Rd / North Buona Vista Rd, to terminate at Buona Vista, or even Kent Ridge to provide the BPJ - UBT - Dunearn - NUS link, complementing 151 / 184.</p>
              <p>Then again, for any rationalisations, compromises have to be made when links are lost. If 171 ends up being cut, you could just increase the frequency of 852.</p>

              <p>Just let me say.. i took 171 and noticed it has around 60+ pax who take 171 from BPJ interior to Upper Bukit Timah road / Bukit Timah road.. The bus almost went empty before hitting Adam/Ferrar road junction with around 15 pax on board... again picked up good number of pax along the stretch before Newton to Orchard.

              <p>The discussion actually started with 171 Enviro... and then switched to rationalization... To say... it was mostly working people, not many kids... and loading started dropping from say after Hillview junction on Upper Bukit Timah... the main high load was between Yishun and Upper Bukit Timah... Having said that there were still standees on the bus until Swiss Club Link on Bukit Timah road... </p>

              <p><br>I doubt that the main passengers Mr BusAnalyzer encountered are students, as departing from Yishun at 7.50am is too late for students (generally they need to reach school before 7.45am).</p>
              <p>On a side note, amending 700 to Eng Neo Ave is not a bad idea, as it provides BPJ students a faster (and door-to-door) journey. Currently students already complain about 67 and 171 etc being too slow, and surprisingly, some of them prefer to take 190/972 etc to Whitley Rd and transfer to 151/154/156. Just that I'm not sure if this will disappoint those taking 700 to city.</p>

              <p>Not yet.. the trees along Slip Rd from Mandai to BKE is still not trimmed... just drove by this morning. In fact, the tree canopies seemed to have gotten thicker and hanging lower ... maybe the haze encourages rapid branch/leaves growth??</p>

              <p>Ha ha... so much for AMDEP making way for DDs... I think AMDEP took only to satisfy 854 BSEP and 857 for now.</p>
              <p>Maybe 5084/5085 will go AMDEP or that also might end up with KJ. I hope AMDEP so that it can start deploying more DDs on 854.</p>
