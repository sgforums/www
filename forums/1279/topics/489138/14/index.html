              <p>How is the route not DD friendly when 850E runs DDs along Ring road stretch towards Khatib?? </p>
              <p>How many services would LTA/SMRT transfer to WPDEP bcoz AMDEP cant take in DDs? In meantime, didn't have choice but to go on adding A22s. </p>
              <p>Even after transfer to TT, doubtful 860 will get many bendies... A24s order is so little that it is out of question... and 860 is WAB so all the non-WAB bendies are useless... at max 2-3 can get deployed... So sooner or later 860 needs to get DDs.</p>
              <p>Also we have to note 860 loading is crazy even though the flats from st 41 to ave 4 on both side of ring road are still under construction. Once they are ready in 2016/2017... 860 will be more like 291 fleet with maximum DDs.</p>

              <p>All I'm saying is that LTA and SMRT probably had their reasons to not deploy DDs on 860. I don't think extending 860 route will give them a reason to deploy DDs because 983 route is shorter than 860 and it still gets DDs almost full fleet. Next, even if SMRT doesn't want DDs, LTA has final say for this BSEP route. And it can't be because LTA doesn't want DDs on its routes because the fundamentals besides BSEP is providing more capacity. LTA has been upgrading SDs to DDs in most cases instead of fleet add so my elimination method only brought me to conclude it must be with the route? Unless, there might be other reasons. Does 850E duplicate the whole of 860? Also 850E for its route changed recently also.</p>
              <p>When LTA takes over BSEP buses and not service 860, SMRT will have to deploy its own buses so let's see what they do. Even if LTA wanted to use those Bendys now, they can't cos they are not BSEP. And let's just say LTA doesn't prioritise getting Bendys for now because there are still too many around than what would be needed for the future bus fleet of singapore. DDs get priority to upgrade SMRT's trunks that have been severely neglected.</p>

              <p>I don't see a reason why you mention 850E's route amendment. DDs were already deployed on 850E before the route amendment, so the old 850E route must be DD-friendly. It makes no sense to say that the deleted sector suddenly became DD-unfriendly just because 850E changed its route. </p>
              <p>Plus, even after 850E's amendment, it still duplicates a significant portion of 860.</p>

              <p>All I'm saying is that LTA and SMRT probably had their reasons
              to not deploy DDs on 860. I don't think extending 860 route will
              give them a reason to deploy DDs because 983 route is shorter than
              860 and it still gets DDs almost full fleet. Next, even if SMRT
              doesn't want DDs, LTA has final say for this BSEP route. And it
              can't be because LTA doesn't want DDs on its routes because the
              fundamentals besides BSEP is providing more capacity. LTA has been
              upgrading SDs to DDs in most cases instead of fleet add so my
              elimination method only brought me to conclude it must be with the
              route? Unless, there might be other reasons. Does 850E duplicate
              the whole of 860? Also 850E for its route changed recently
              also.</p>
              <p>When LTA takes over BSEP buses and not service 860, SMRT will
              have to deploy its own buses so let's see what they do. Even if LTA
              wanted to use those Bendys now, they can't cos they are not BSEP.
              And let's just say LTA doesn't prioritise getting Bendys for now
              because there are still too many around than what would be needed
              for the future bus fleet of singapore. DDs get priority to upgrade
              SMRT's trunks that have been severely neglected.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The reason to me is pretty clear - it has nothing to do with the route... as 860 route can manage with DDs. </p>
              <p>The reason is that before AMDEP became DD friendly, LTA already upsized sv 860 fleet to 16 buses from a fleet of 07 buses last year... so you can see 09 buses were added... With a frequency of 03-05 mins during peak hours, and 860 managing the load very well... LTA now does not see immediate need to upgrade SD --&gt; DD when it has a lot more challenges with other SMRT trunk routes.</p>
              <p>860 SDs in AM take around 50-60 pax these days because of bunching... and PM is around 40-60 pax depending on bus arrival... In general... 16 buses is too much for the route.</p>
              <p>In future, I do expect some buses to be cut and converted to DD... Also note that Ring road between ave 11 and ave 4 still has lot of construction and new flats that will open.</p>
              <p>By Q4 2016/Q1 2017... sv 860 will have a fleet of say 12 DDs, 4 SDs... similar to sv 291.</p>

              <p>Yaa. Service 860 can have that many DDs in the future when population in Yishun has increased. But for now 860 can have 2 to 3 DDs for a start. </p>

              <p>Yes that's one straight forward option. </p>
              <p>But now, Yishun could easily get another new BSEP svc rather than fleet add. Comparing to 983(CCK), it's limited now. </p>
              <p>I believe LTA didn't put DDs on 860 straight away is because they (also) want to boost the manpower "stress load" on SMRT. Further more, there could be some new BSEP svc coming up. If, by then, the loading stays, DD upgrade will the be option. </p>
              <p>That's my point of view ; because if you just deploy DD to the svc, downgrades here and there will be seen. No. of drivers won't increase faster.</p>
