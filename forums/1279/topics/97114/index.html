            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh! I much prefer to read about "real" stuff about buses. How come so many fantasy topics leh? get real! talk real issues, stop daydreaming!! read so many of such similar stuff damn sian. Can't be true that we have all run out of real-life stuff on buses to talk about right.<br><br>so many topics like "Fantasy bus routes", "fantasy bus interchange", "fantasy bus companies", "what are your terminals (your imaginary bus co.)", "fantasy bus fleet deployment".......... i think you get the idea *faints* oso "what kind of peculiar routes you have in mind" is the worst of all topics, it's 'fantasy bus routes' by another name......repetitive....and it's "particular" not "peculiar"!! wah phiang!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>besides talking about reality, sometimes people should also be allowed to dream. hence the "fantasy" topics. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>well, this forum so far as I know (because I only joined recently) has a real wealth of information such as the different bus models and routes and history of bus routes n interchanges and etc etc etc. also bus fans here have their ideas and comments about present services and how they might want to better improve it, which may not happen in reality immediately, and hence all the fantasy topics.<br><br>just my perception as a student, after taking a look at how all the wealth of information all my qian2 bei4 here in this forum have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No no no....i am not opposed to one or two 'fantasy' topics.....that's fine with me..... but not so many again and again. When topics repeat themselves all over again under a different name/thread....eg "fantasy bus routes" dies out, and then reborn as 'what peculiar routes in mind", the same people writing the same things all over again (!!!).... i am sure maybe people shudder at the repetition!<br><br>the word 'fantasy' also suggests that it's just daydreaming......one can fantasize...but one must not get so carried away to imagine fantasies will one day turn into reality hor! we are not living in some fairy tale!<br><br>and frankly, does anyone seriously think bus companies monitor this forum and act accordingly to the daydreams of users here! aiyo!!!! real life bus routes must not only serve public, but must oso be profitable.....must do market research by monitoring real life use of bus routes/times/frequency, must hold meetings with transport authorities, must follow govt legislation governing sbstransit/smrt, must calculate if route is profitable/essential, must think if it meets transport goals, must think of bus/manpower resources ...........i think turning the idle daydreams of a few into reality is not on their list of priorities!<br><br>it's perfectly alright to briing up REAL LIFE ISSUES AND SUGGESTIONS....i think if topics are given more earnest words like 'suggestions for bus amendments' or if ppl write to sbstransit/smrt maybe got chance for real life changes......but writing under 'fantasy bus routes' and expecting to be taken seriously (assuming that bus companies actually read this forum) is like hoping to strike toto. hahahaha....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some want a test bed and comments before sending their proposed routes up. some jus wished such a route existed but they noe it wun be feasible practically. but it's still perfectly fine to discuss about these fantasies as that's where things start to move on. at least ppl get to experiment around with different routes.<br><br>some users like to re-create a topic as the previous topic might be too 'cold' or they wan a new topic for their own suggested route. thus, now i've put up a sticky jus for tis purpose and i hope all users will continue to stick to tat.<br><br></div>
