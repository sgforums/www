              <p>When 70B was introduced, they adjusted one of the split shift duties to do 70B only during AM Peak. Fleet size was unchanged then. When BSEP bus 3302 came in that's when the fleet addition came in. Problem with 70 now that I have is the WAB buses dont tally with the WAB blocks as there's an excess of 2-3 non-WAB buses running on WAB duties. But I find that a small issue, fleet size correct with the correct number of buses would be enough.</p>
              <p>As for 85... probably 1987 is still perm while 8993 replaces 0963.</p>

              <p>Sv 15 had 2 revisions in 2012 - 16 Jan was 
              to adjust run time, 23 Jul was to add a morning downroute from Eunos to 
              Marine Parade at 0609h. Both revisions saw a slight change in how the overnight parking blocks were assigned. but of course full fleet size of Sv 15 requires on the ground checking for the missing bus cos on paper, its 15 buses.</p>

              <p>this one need to check on the xover timings, and probably PM peak for 255 when there's no xover between 255 and 179.</p>

              <p>Sv 15 had 2 revisions in 2012 - 16 Jan was to adjust run time,
              23 Jul was to add a morning downroute from Eunos to Marine Parade
              at 0609h. Both revisions saw a slight change in how the overnight
              parking blocks were assigned. but of course full fleet size of Sv
              15 requires on the ground checking for the missing bus cos on
              paper, its 15 buses.</p>
              <p>I think the missing one is probably one of the BN spare citaros.
              that duty does the morning downroute from Tampines Ave 9 to
              Tampines Int. needs verification. I didnt list Sv 28 as one of the

              <p>So for Sv 15, on paper it's 15 buses as of now, but in reality might be more? Think I'll have to check it again sometime soon when I'm free during peak hours.<br><br>Sv 28's fleet size problem existed like before 2012 I think, before 1926Z left 28 for SP then 69. </p>

              <p>Just saw 1942B &amp; 8189M on Sv 15 yesterday though...and as far as I'm concerned, the Mk4s on Sv 15 are still safe as of now~ <br><br>8189M comes down from PIE at around 0715hrs+ during AM Peak to turn into PSR Int to start the first trip thereafter usually from PSR Int.</p>
              <p>I'm thinking the extra bus out from 33 might be that 2600 or 2629A. 2629A did almost all the PSR services since Oct..didn't spot it lately though cause I was overseas~</p>

              <p>earlier 154A trips probably done by the 157 buses, and those that start late from Boon Lay. the 7+ trips are done by 1 bus. maybe a swap of duties occurred means the fleet add bus probably went to replace 8486's old slot.</p>
