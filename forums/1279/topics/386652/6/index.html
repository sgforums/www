              <p><br>New bus terminals don't have to be a stand alone building, like what they are in the 70s and 80s. Entering the new era, LTA can integrate bus terminals into small HDB malls or multistorey car parks, with this bus terminals premises integrated into parts of car parks, loading/unloading areas, etc.</p>
              <p>For example, places like Hougang Green Shopping Mall, Rivervale Mall, Elias Mall, Pasir Ris West Plaza, 888 plaza, etc can be a smaller scale integrated transport hub, like Ang Mo Kio int/AMK hub, Toa Payoh int/HDB hub and Boon Lay int/Jurong Point. With 3 to 4 services in these hubs, you only need at most 10 lots for buses and a boarding and alighting area.</p>
              <p>So it provides a mini transport hub concealed from residents while provide a centralised amenities area for residents. So why not???</p>

              <p><br>I don't think this will be the trend for new bus terminals in future. Firstly, LTA wants a proper looking bus terminal with berths and boarding and alighting points and expansion of bus stops means more lanes of roads will be eaten away. Secondly, such kind of bus stop derived bus terminal is not feasible in the 21st century bus services concept since LTA wants smooth and fast operations for buses along bus stops and bus lanes.</p>
              <p>On the current trend right now, even some of the roadside terminals are in danger of being replaced or removed. Marina Centre terminal might have a new terminal once the IR @ Marina Centre is up, else the current services might be looping around Marina Centre or terminating at Shenton Way. Ghim Moh terminal might be removed and the services might be terminating at Buona Vista instead, which I think Buona Vista might be a proper boarding and alighting terminal in future, where more services are required when One North industrial park becomes more matured, and if any major redevelopment of the old Ghim Moh estate.</p>
              <p>Sims Place terminal might be eliminated if LTA wants to remove the terminal and 64 might be extended to Eunos Interchange, if there is a major redevelopment in Sims Place estate. Geylang Lor 1 terminal already has its replacement soon, near Kallang entertainment center if I'm not wrong.</p>
              <p>The only roadside terminal that is safe will be the one outside Kembagan MRT station. 42 only has one bus parked outside the bus stop and Jalan Kembagan is not a very busy road. Changi Village although an old estate, but I believe that it will be safe, as I don't think there will be any major redevelopments as the authorities might just want to remain the place for its tranquility and tourist attraction.</p>
              <p>Kovan is a different story since Upper Serangoon Road already has a number of servces plying along and Hougang Central interchange nearby. But I think there might be a major redevelopment in future for Kovan, especially the ex-Hougang South bus interchange premises. Maybe the idea of a small integrated transport hub can be build in future, as I feel that Kovan Mall is a bit too small for the current shoppers there. Maybe services 115 and 119 might just terminate there. 83 can even be extended there with direct links to Punggol, Sengkang and Kovan.</p>

              <p>if there's regional or rather neighbourhood bus terminals, chances are trunk svs would make a round before leaving the new town as like pre - 1980s.</p>
              <p>This leds to cancellation of feeder svs (last MRT train issue as well) and it wun be efficient.</p>
              <p>As for long bus stops, it isn't going to work as you're not going to expect ppl to slowly walk up to the 4th or 5th bus. Eventually coming buses would be held back</p>
