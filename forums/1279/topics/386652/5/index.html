              <p>That's why I don't give a crap about public transport anymore, if they are taking away this flexibility and alternatives, to cope the increasing demands and population in future. Hong Kong public transport is still better with a good mix of buses and rails, with rails coping the main populated areas and the buses serving the rest while provide direct links as well. No point building so many expensive rail lines everywhere, especially in small cities like Hong Kong and Singapore. Because commuters are screwed up paying more and more for an inflexible system.</p>

              <p>Thing is, removing 1/2 e seats dun solve e problem in the long run. At the end of the day no matter how much more MRT line they're building, NSL &amp; EWL is going to be choked or get worst w/ more interchanges up.</p>
              <p>There's only 1 MRT line to serve Orchard, and will always be.</p>
              <p>As for buses, build 1 bus int only enough for today. wat abt for tml? Like now special express svs from heartlands to Sentosa?</p>

              <p>And trust me, the vaccum left by the unnecessary cancellation of trunk services will be filled up by cars. There were 925,518 vehicles on the road as of December, if you want it to reach 1 million within 2 years, you can go ahead and cut bus services in the way you like.</p>

              <p>Eh Eh. Relax. I did consider your above options. I didn't say cancelling all of the trunk services. I was trying to say reducing trunk services.</p>
              <p>As for the terminals. Perhaps an few addition for the heartlands.</p>

              <p><br>The issue is the cost hence MRT can't be serving everywhere either.</p>
              <p>Another thing is I've mentioned, as more MRT lines are up, chances are EWL &amp; NSL are going to be more packed. Imagine removing Svs like 22 &amp; 24 and forcing ppl at Paya Lebar to take CCL and squeeze w/ ppl at Bishan en-route AMK.</p>
              <p>There's a limit the MRT can take.</p>
