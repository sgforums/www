              <p>SBS buy buses, far hike kpkb so much. Saw those stepless buses
              are frills..</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, e SBS single decks cost $350k and you get
              stepless + wheelchair accessible.</p>
              <p>$200k, 1 China bus (dunno easy to find maintenance spare parts
              or notch), compare w/ Coaster. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I've ever calculated before, in the long term, using either
              buses dun cost much in diff. It's fuel consumption, maintenance
              that's e biggest cost factor.</p>

              <p>May i look at some of your calculations? Fuel consumption wise, how do you know its higher? Afterall manual transmission vehicles tend to save more fuel than automatic transmission vehicles. And also regarding this point, without the auto trans, a large portion of maintenance cost is eliminated.</p>

              <p>But the point here is, is there a steep incline to overcome? The gear change issue depends on the driver and how skilled he is to shift into the respective gear when climbing up slope, or down slope. A automatic transmission simply makes the life of the driver easier, but at a cost of fuel efficiency.</p>
              <p>Also, if thats the case why hasen't many of the private bus operators switched all their new vehicles to auto transmission if your claim that manual will sip more fuel in our traffic condition in singapore? The minivans, lorries, trucks. etc?</p>
              <p>I would also like to bring your attention to the yutongs that advance coach are using, and what spare parts are you talking about? The engines are cummins powered, and how is that not common in the region? What other proper spare parts do you need other than the engine and the transmission that is <strong>rare</strong> to obtain?</p>

              <p>If you end up w/ this prob of gear dragging which is of an human issues, esp for public buses they wun want it. Thousands of buses having issues of gear dragging. You can train them not to drag gear but is it going to help?</p>
              <p>Manual ppl will still buy because of the impulse cost issue. Do ppl really bother long term cost?</p>
              <p>As for lorries, they need the torque esp carrying close to max load. In this case it's diff to operating buses on the need for smoother rides.</p>
              <p>Yutong may be a special case, but for the other PRC buses?</p>

              <p><br>That is only a start of their business for the first few weeks. Maybe the ridership will increase after some time. This will be a good replacement for 950 if they can managed it well.</p>

              <p>Since SMRT is so interested in providing premium services, then let them take over all the premium services. They can use the buses for morning peak premiums, then afternoon for shuttle buses like to IKEA and RWS, and at night the Night Riders.</p>
              <p>No need to provide basic services since they are not interested and their main core is rail. Let SBST take on all the basic services. In the mean time, just wait for a 3rd operator that is as good as SBST and TIBS to complement some of SBST basic routes. People are forced to take public transport and forced to face fare increases every year, but not to forced to accept sub standard services with no obvious reasonings.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Singapore bus share market is so small, if it is gonna shrink in future, then no one will wants to take them since this is a money losing business and shrinking the market share just result in losing more money. I can't imagine how LTA is going to shrink the market in future, i.e. cutting up routes, further shorting and even withdrawal after that.</p>
