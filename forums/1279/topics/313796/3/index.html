              <p>Agree with you but answering of phone calls is acceptable but please try to keep it very very short. Many young ladies like to talk for a very long duration for nothing. Also, I see many young girls/ladies talking loudly and <strong>unneccesarily for nothing also. If you must talk, please do it softly and please do not laugh and touch each other. I find it irritating. That is why you can't hear the in-train annoucements. I find it very irritating when people's handphone ring. I have no idea why they must use such a loud and irritating ringtone. You can get the best experience on the last few trains at night when it is very empty.</strong></p>

              <p>in the end, it all boils down to basic courtesy. if everyone think of the other's well being and convenience when in the train, the experience will be a lot nicer. as it is, the train is crowded enough. we don't need all these counter-social behaviour.</p>
              <p>unfortunately, it is also all about positive influence and being exposed to socially responsible behaviour. if all these `bad habits' are deem acceptable, then it's hard to change then. it is my observations of train commuters overseas and their good habits are what prompted me to `do the right thing'. for instance, I observed that in the foodcourt in USA, most not only clear their own trays after eating, they also clean up the table so the next users can enjoy their food. for that, I am conscious of not dirtying the table when i eat here. and i clear my tray everytime i had my macs or kfc. but because it is not the norm and many are not exposed to such practice, it then become socially acceptable.  </p>
