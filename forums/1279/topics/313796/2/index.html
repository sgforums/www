              <p><br>They should do one for SMRTB... see how bad they can go.</p>
              <p>Just this evening I had a very unpleasant experience... BC of 1058K on 812 came back from east loop first round, ready to do second round. Instead of parking his bus at the bus park he went on all the way to park at the boarding berth, open the middle exit door and went out to tap his card, then take his own sweet time for 2 long minutes before coming back. I mean, tapping the card takes less than 3 seconds. What's more, TIB 0781L was behind all the while, waiting for the driver to finish his damn business. Not only were the 812 pax unhappy, 171 pax were also unhappy.</p>
              <p>I guess this warrants a letter to maybe ST Forums... glorify the name of SMRTB.</p>

              <p>The problem is this kind of "audit" are usually wayang business. The companies involved are usually informed and prepared well beforehand. Anyone who know how WITS and ISO certification works will know what I mean.</p>
              <p>Speaking of "customer experience", I never had good experience, even back to the days before SMRT became multimodal. TIBS yes, SMRT Buses, hardly.</p>
              <p>Not to be a racist or sadist or whatever you called it, but I think those "judges" are certainly not local and not asian. You should get what I mean.</p>

              <p>i am not sure how singapore can clinch the best experience award. having been to metros in many parts of asia, my experience here in SG is far from `best'. granted i only ride the train once or twice a week, but i can attest to my so-so experience most times i am on board; or i am just plain unlucky. much has to do with the bad attitude of some bad apples. my bitching includes:</p>
              <p>1. not moving in into the carriage readily. some actually try to `extend' themselves to take up more space so you on the outside can't get in.</p>
              <p>2. talking on the cell phone while in the train</p>
              <p>3. talking in the train (ok, some may find this acceptable, but why let people know you got stood up in your last night date?)</p>
              <p>4. not showering in the morning. the BO on some is `day spoiling'.</p>
              <p>5. putting their phone mp3 on loudspeaker. not everyone's into click 5.</p>
              <p>6. some who spread out their ST or wanbao while reading in the train. can't they fold it into the `right' size so it doesn't impinge on the others?</p>
              <p>i could score till 10 but i know i am just unnecessary grumpy today. it's a monday.</p>
              <p>btw, japanese are immaculately well behaved in the train. they automatically switch off their phone or put them in silent mode. they hardly answer any incoming call. they read small paperbacks and hardly converse inside. sometimes, i wish they could loosen up a little. but not sure why they are not selected or shortlisted.  </p>

              <p>Seriously, I feel that SBST and MTR gave me a better impression than SMRT in terms of service.</p>
              <p>How often do you see SMRT staff at platforms, besides at terminating stations where they need to chase passengers out (any other operator would do the same). SBST has staff at the busier stations redirecting people to less crowded areas of the platforms, while MTR has a platform guard stand/counter at their stations, which the staff would regularly make annoucements about arriving trains. At Central station during peak hours, there are additional staff at the platforms to stop people from entering the trains if they deem it too full for people at Admiralty to board. The only time I can think of MTR staff being unable to handle the crowds is when there is a No. 8 Typhoon signal, when everyone leaves their office at the same time. And certainly, MTR counter staff serve customers better, as even though their standard of English/Mandarin isn't that good, they would not rush though the process of serving the customer.  Even Japan, which has crowded trains, have pushers to push passengers into trains such that train operators can run smoothly.</p>
              <p>And yah, the frequency of SBST and MTR are much better. Yes there are 8 mins frequencies on the MTR, but that seems to be limited to the Tung Chung Line, which mainly serves the town of Tung Chung, so, during Saturday off peak, the train isn't that full even after 8 mins. The other lines seem to have a max of 4 mins. While SBST's NEL frequency, which stands at 6 mins off peak, still allows passengers to find a seat on the train.</p>
              <p>Its all about how much a company wants to give. Service comes from the top (eh from the GEMs ad).</p>

              <p>Agree with you but answering of phone calls is acceptable but please try to keep it very very short. Many young ladies like to talk for a very long duration for nothing. Also, I see many young girls/ladies talking loudly and <strong>unneccesarily for nothing also. If you must talk, please do it softly and please do not laugh and touch each other. I find it irritating. That is why you can't hear the in-train annoucements. I find it very irritating when people's handphone ring. I have no idea why they must use such a loud and irritating ringtone. You can get the best experience on the last few trains at night when it is very empty. </strong></p>
