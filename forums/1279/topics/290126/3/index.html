The cons is that the bus' speed will be reduced . The pros will be that when carrying a heavy load up a hill , say the bus is fully laden , the bus can still move up the hill without crawling like a snail .<br><br>That time during the AOH , there are Merc and MKIVs . The MKIVs (striders) were crawling desperately up the steep incline . The merc however , moved straight up the hill without much strain .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
