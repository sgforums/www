            <div class='col-md body'>0405 is built for travelling within the city, B10M is built for expressway coach. so 0405 pickup speed is good so that it can travel efficiently in the city and can chiong between bus-stops. but on the expressway cannot go that fast. B10M pickup speed is slower and somehow feels more 'heavy'. but its powerful on expressway, can chiong v well if not for the speed limiter (though Mk2 &amp; Mk3 dun haf i think).</div>
