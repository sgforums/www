Take it that both buses have same horsepower ratings and torque . The merz will still win. Why? The Merz have a Hub Reduction axle. What the Hub Reduction axle does is that it reduces rotational speed while increasing torque . A higher torque level = better acceleration . Hence the merz may win in the end.</div>

Scania L94UB, Scania N113CRB or Scania K230UB? Make urself clear.<br><br>SBS2888T can really chiong on PIE and ECP stretches. Maybe because of the gearbox though which makes it change gears faster.</div>

Some of these Mk3s, although they can speed on the expressways, but if the BC wants to keep it steady, they cant realise their full potential. SBS781E is 1 BNDEP Mk3 that can speed, but not as fast as the ex-Sv 89e Mk3s.</div>
