              <p>A lot of these services ply along DTL western wing. When DTL opens, most of these services don't even need to use high capacity buses. Some of the route might even be axed or shortern.</p>
              <p>And some of these services are affected by low branches along Dunearn Road. I would suggest LTA and NEA to work together to relocate these low branch trees and replace them with high branching trees, thus to allow double deckers to ply along the road. It is such a waste that double deckers can't ply along that stretch of road just because of low tree branches to provide a better bus service overall.</p>
              <p>Worse that because of this, many commercial vehicles as well, especially large mobile cranes and container trucks have to make a big detour just because of this. Wasting fuel and money for companies.</p>

              <p>If you look into many of the routes along Dunearn Road, their demands will be dropped once DTL opens.</p>
              <p>And just look at Henderson Road, low branches but SBST still manages to use single deckers for all the services there.So other than demand drop in future, these services can just use single deck buses. But I gonna agree that NEA and LTA should do something with the trees along the road. The problem shouldn't stay like this forever.</p>

              <p>SMRT should retain bendies for their feeders which has served them very well for many years. SMRT should get double deckers for their trunk services which don't have any height limits. Retain bendies for trunk services which have height limits like 67(?). For svc like 67 or 169 maybe can mix DD and bendy because not all commuters are long-haul ones and may just want to alight after a few stops, making them unwilling to go upstairs. for trunk-feeder hybrid like 962 or 859, i think its best stick with bendy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>wow you guys are busting your nuts over this. if smrt operate bendy, so be it. if smrt gets dds, good for them. if smrt operates both, best of both worlds.</strong></p>

              <p>In practise, there is a lot that can affect the performance and fuel economy of a city bus (e.g. weight / load, topography, engine design, maintenance, driver training / driving style).  There is a very important relationship between the engine and the transmission that affects the engine speed at any given road speed.  It is therefore perfectly possible for bus with a small displacement engine to use more fuel than a bus fitted with a large displacement engine simply because it is working at non-optimal engine speeds when cruising at important road speeds.</p>
              <p>You sound like a typical 'fleet manager' who has never been involved with buses or understand the relationship of power and torque outputs of an engine vs. displacement.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is perfectly possible for a small displacement engine to make similar peak power and torque figures compared to a large displacement engine, but at what cost?  You need a larger turbocharger capable of supplying higher boost pressure to the engine (read: slower transient throttle response and higher boost threshold), larger cooling system to handle the increased heat rejection, stronger internal engine components in order to cope with the higher operating pressure, and possibly shorter servicing intervals due to the engine operating at closer to its physical limitations.  Furthermore, a small displacement engine produces low torque at the most important low engine speeds where the turbocharger is inefficient, which is not ideal for driveability, meaning that in order for the bus to accelerate at a sufficient rate, you need to keep the engine speeds high which in turn means unnecessary noise and vibration.  Larger engines not only produce high power and torque at lower engine speeds, but also provide a larger torque band - a window of engine speeds where peak torque is available under foot.  This ensures less gearchanges required even in harsh topographies and the possibility of using a taller final drive ratio, further keeping engines speeds and therefore noise and vibration levels lower.</p>
              <p>So in short, smaller engines DO NOT automatically mean lower fuel consumption.</p>

              <p>The downsizing of engines in passenger cars may be acceptable considering naturally aspirated engines are currently the norm and the maximum weight likely to require shifting is unlikely to exceed 2,000kg, but when you're dealing with commercial vehicles where turbocharged diesel engines are already the norm, you're dealing with a completely different kettle of fish.</p>
              <p>There are times where additional tax expenditure is unlikely to dictate decisions made by an operator.  The extra money spent on road tax brings the benefit of higher levels of passenger comfort (i.e. lower complaints due to rough gearchanges or high noise / vibration levels) and decreased downtime and operating costs due to longer life of components that are put under lower levels of stress.</p>

              <p>I believe it will come to a time that commercial vehicles will downsize their engines soon. The car engine technologies are the test bed for any technological advnaces in the past as they are smaller and easier to implement and test out before using these technologies for bigger machines. Once auto manufacturers are able to produce efficient and lasting smaller engines which can produce adequate performance and cleaner engines, they will intorduce it to bigger vehicles. As our fuel sources are rapidly depleting and booming world population, plus awareness of greener enviroment globally, this technological advancement has to be improved.</p>
              <p>Bus manufacturers have also been trying to downsizing engines, offering smaller engines with adequate performance. Technologies might be premature but these will be improved as time passes.</p>
              <p>In Singapore context, we are moving more into greener awareness. The implementation of EURO IV requirements in a few years time will certainly affect our bus operators' decisions, which they are even looking into EURO IV and beyond. However as engines move beyong EURO IV, bus operators are making smaller efficient engines for stricter emission standards too. How many options they have???</p>
              <p>Lastly, our government may also implement carbon tax soon, which bus operators should also consider this as well. Road tax is another issue to consider. Right now, our bus operators are beginning to use smaller engines which are comfortable as well.</p>

              <p>In Singapore context, we are moving more into greener awareness.
                  The implementation of EURO IV requirements in a few years time will
                  certainly affect our bus operators' decisions, which they are even
                  looking into EURO IV and beyond. However as engines move beyong
                  EURO IV, bus operators are making smaller efficient engines for
                  stricter emission standards too. How many options they have???</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>A bigger engine may not always be less clean than a 'smaller' engine. Take the OC500LE which displaces ~12000cc and the KUB which displaces ~8900cc as an example...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO, SCR is the way to go to reduce emissions, not EGR, which is the direction Mercedes is going. The pros and cons of SCR outweigh the pros and cons of EGR. With SCR, there is little to no sacrifice needed to the engine displacement/size, which may comprimise performance. and I've seen much more smoke and soot exiting the KUB (and MAN's) EGR engine than the B9TL WEG2 and OC's SCR engine....</p>

              <p>As for our road tax structure, it simply discourage our
              operators to buy big engine capacity buses. Thus looking into
              smaller engines that provides acceptable performance while going in
              line with the government green policies.</p>

              <p>and how much do bureaucrats know about the relationship between engine capacity, performance and savings over the course of the bus lifespan? "acceptable" performance with lower tax rates may seem very attractive now but what operators should go for are savings in the long run while not comprimising on performance.</p>

              <p>Please check your facts before posting.  The 5-litre engine is for HYBRID BUSES ONLY.  The 8-litre Euro VI engine replaces the 7 and 9-litre Euro V engines.</p>
