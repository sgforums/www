              <p>The Citaro C2 is offered in both Euro V and Euro VI configurations, so it's still a possible contender. It will however likely cost more than whatever other chassis they could find + a regional bodywork.</p>

                          <p>Alighting and boarding are faster with bendies. Happens every
                          morning at Clementi MRT bus stop. 154 and 183 DDs always hog the
                          bus stop for minutes and people refusing to move up to the upper
                          deck.</p>
                          <p>Yes, bendies are long but alighting as extremely fast from a
                          full bus to empty bus, unlike DDs. Boarding is faster to a certian
                          extent, but boarding on DDs are slower due to people alighting from
                          the upper deck.</p>
                          <p>Bendies have noise at the articulator when they are bouncing or
                          at uneven surfaces because the below of the articulator is sagging.
                          Can't be helped. You have to replace the whole thing, like what
                          they did in refurbishments.</p>
                          <p><strong>If I am not wrong</strong> the depot can easily
                          disable/enable door interlock and speed limiter. SL can also
                          disable speed limiter on the older models too.</p>
                          <p>No working bus stopping bell? Because it's spoilt? You think the
                          depot is very free to get the bus back as and when they wish to
                          repair a petty bell? As long the bus stopping light it lit on, it
                          should be no problem.</p>
                          <p>You seemed to be biased towards DDs. <em style="font-weight: bold;">Yes</em>, DDs are better. <em style="font-weight: bold;">But no,</em> bendies are not horrible. It
                          is just the matter of it being depolyed on the route suited to it
                          and passenger habits too. </p>

                  So ppl not willing to move up to the upper deck and you can it's socially ok... So the bendies ppl not moving into the 2nd end is ok? Suddenly people are now pulling out social ills to justify for claiming DDs are hogging up the place... Need me to say you self pwn yourself... Clementi was ever noticed by myself that behind buses was clogging up the Ave 2 junction because 106, 189 and 184 bendies were hogging up the place because of either mass alighting or boarding..
              
              Dun want to move, dun come and say ppl taught you to say this ungracious behaviour is ok.
              
              Furthermore, in reality bendies can only ergonomically 110 ppl, w/ 50 standee... ADDs can do more than that..
                      
              Dun forget, bendies are hogging up the space in the CBD during the peak hrs as like 190.. it's mostly boarding in the AM peak at BPJ, alighting in CBD.. The reverse occurs in the evening... There'll defintely be somewhere there's pure boarding and alighting. Now comes is whether can the infrastructure cope.
                      
              When the articulator has sound and it's not properly managed, it's something awaiting to happen... 
                      
              Uh huh.. Then what's the door interlock for? quite a no of times alrdy... Habits w/ swing plug door opened n chiong off onto the road...
                      
              And, if I tell you I overhear an SL telling a commuter that SMRT decided to disable the bus stopping bell because it's too noisy, what's your reaction? It's not spoiled.. It's just that it's too noisy... Then what's the bell for?
                      
              No... LTA's new int are alrdy telling you to suit to 12m buses.. Boon Lay, S'goon, Jurong East Temp, BPJ Temp are good examples. And stop using social ill behaviour as I can tell u, bendies ppl also dun move in as if there's ghost on the 2nd carriage...

              The SL even had the cheek to tell the commuter to look at the running LED screen for the bus stopping wording..

              Oh ya.. Tibs that time say the primary reason for O405G was because London also buying bendies.. now London culled all the bendies... so how now??? If Tibs is still around, I think it's a big self pwned...

              <p>I think the major concern for bendies is the space in new interchanges. We argue that bendies take a lot of place in CBD. That is true.</p>
              <p>But has anyone bothered to see the mess bendies cause in Woodlands Int. It is not CBD, but the amount of clogging and line during peak hours because of bendies - it is crazy.</p>
              <p>If you look at Tampines, Bedok, Boon Lay - they have equal or more number of services at these interchanges, yet you will hardly find queuing of buses and delay at the very first stop.</p>
              <p>I am not saying NO to bendies. Use them, but rationally.</p>
              <p>1. You need to convert CBD running routes to DD</p>
              <p>2. You need to convert FEW routes at Woodlands Int and may be Yishun (when the new interchange comes alive) to DD</p>
              <p>SMRT should take a smart call to bring in DDs and while I know it upsets bendy fans, it is time not to get emotional, but practical.</p>

              <p>People doesn't want to move into the rear of SMRT's O405s... Reason? Simple.<br><br>No place to stand properly at the rear. The rear of it does not have any poles or grab handles to stabilize yourself. Since safety comes first, people crowd at the exit.</p>

              <p>Agreed. And I can sight so many instances even on Bukit Timah Road, where bendies create nuisance even if it is not a heavily crowded road.</p>
              <p>Bendies are good in Yishun / CCK / Sembawag / Woodlands, but again in moderation, otherwise it can create a huge mess like it is doing in Woodlands.</p>

              The BI layout aren't even designed for bendies... need me to say abt SL force reversing out of boarding bay because a bendy blocking it's path? lol
              
              I wonder what Tibs was thinking back then.. just to be special... yet WRI, Yishun BI not even designed for bendies in the first place...
              
              and MBT still ask SBS to handover more bus sv area to Tibs.. making the situation worst... 
              
              ya hor.. if Woodlands was still as it is, and Bus Int at Woodlands Centre... how ar?

              <p>I hope SMRT can take this chance now to switch over to double deckers and ditch bendies for good. Ignore those childish kids who only think of their own fantasies.</p>
              <p>They are not practical anymore and will not be in future. Look at the mess they make along bus stops, bus lanes, bus interchanges and bus depots. Look at the frustrations made to the BCs themselves, other buses and BCs, other passengers who got delayed by the jams and queues caused by them and other road users. Look at the time wasted for other buses and passengers just to wait for them to clear the bus stop/berth, change lanes, park, etc. Look at the land space they take up in bus interchanges and depots where bus companies can park more buses for better frequncies and more bus services without taking up extra expensive and scarce area. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Some services can't even boost their capacity just because they cannot use bendies for the route, due to plying along busy roads in CBD or busy bus stops and not enough place in depots and interchanges to park these buses.</p>
              <p>SMRT bus services should buck up from now onwards and get rid of the old problems. Better manage their bus management and ditch bendies for good and use just single and double deckers to make their operations easier and lower their cost of operations. In this way, they can have less problems with parking spaces, jams and queues in interchanges and boost the number of buses to park in depots and interchanges to increase frequencies of their current bus services and introduce a few more service with more 12m single and double deckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>If SMRT don't have any bendies for now, they can easily have 1000 12 m buses which can help them to increase their loading capacities with better frequencies and introduce 1 to 2 bus services for Sembawang already. SMRT, please look into the future and don't repeat the mistake made in the past.</p>
