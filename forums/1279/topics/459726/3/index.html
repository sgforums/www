              now now now... ppl now dragging and assuming who that person is by name... maybe that's showing what people say abt bendies are right... no way to justify, now go attack using something else...
              
              ASSUMING is a very good word...
                      
              I've ever said bef, standardisation is the only way to deal with matters... Chapalang fleet not only now pwns yourself over maintenance issue, it also makes BI planning very bad... Gotta make special arrangement for arti fleet.. and not many space can be offered...
              
              I think ppl here still dun get it why chapalang fleet dun work... If you think it's so easy to plan everything with a little of this and that, then go work in LTA... Think of how to bao gar liao all the bendy, ADD, SD needs together esp in the CBD area...
                  
              A lot of details takes a little think and one step back to figure out what works and what does not... Something that claims to be good may not really as good as what it is either...

              Explain why SL &amp; BC are acknowleding bendy buses are dangerous buses for their backside? Do you know abt it? Stop snaking around...
              
              Dear SMB228X... Ppl tell you O405G no interlock, the backside sticking out, bendy maintenance even to the point they dun bother to reinstall a working bell.. you DARE NOT EVEN justify anything back.. 
              
              Do you observe in the first place? Ppl tell you A, you also believe it even though it's verified to be untrue...
              
              You still have not answered me.. if one fine day Citaro become creepy dirty buses for lack of maintenance and a new Mercedes series appear.. how? Eating your own words?

              As again, I'll ask this qn...
              
              Back then when Tibs decided to purchase bendies... 
              
              They'd knew BPJ bus stops many can't really take in bendy buses when the New Town matures further, the Woodlands Centre Bus Int may only move in after the launch of the bendies (for those who dunno this, the MRT expected completion in the past are much more conservative, the NSEWL was actually targeted to commence fully in 1992).
              
              The Woodlands Regional Int is not as widely spaced as per the older SBS interchanges say Jurong East or Bt Batok, using bendy buses would mean buses have to properly queue up and give way... Not reversing out...
              
              Not to mention size of the typical bus stops.
              
              All these is now come to think of it... It all boils down to planning... I believe SBST has their own reason to get rid of the 2 bendy buses eventually.
              
              If people cannot justify any of these issues, dun bother to troll and start another round of attacking...

              <p>I hope SMRT can take this chance now to switch over to double
                  deckers and ditch bendies for good. Ignore those childish kids who
                  only think of their own fantasies.</p>
              <p>They are not practical anymore and will not be in future. Look
                  at the mess they make along bus stops, bus lanes, bus interchanges
                  and bus depots. Look at the frustrations made to the BCs
                  themselves, other buses and BCs, other passengers who got delayed
                  by the jams and queues caused by them and other road
                  users. Look at the time wasted for other buses and passengers
                  just to wait for them to clear the bus stop/berth, change lanes,
                  park, etc. Look at the land space they take up in bus interchanges
                  and depots where bus companies can park more buses for better
                  frequncies and more bus services without taking up extra expensive
                  and scarce area. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Some services can't even boost their capacity just because they
                  cannot use bendies for the route, due to plying along busy roads in
                  CBD or busy bus stops and not enough place in depots and
                  interchanges to park these buses.</p>
              <p>SMRT bus services should buck up from now onwards and get rid of
                  the old problems. Better manage their bus management and ditch
                  bendies for good and use just single and double deckers to
                  make their operations easier and lower their cost of operations. In
                  this way, they can have less problems with parking spaces, jams and
                  queues in interchanges and boost the number of buses to park in
                  depots and interchanges to increase frequencies of their current
                  bus services and introduce a few more service with more 12m single
                  and double deckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>If SMRT don't have any bendies for now, they can easily have
                  1000 12 m buses which can help them to increase their loading
                  capacities with better frequencies and introduce 1 to 2 bus
                  services for Sembawang already. SMRT, please look into the future
                  and don't repeat the mistake made in the past.</p>

              and if they can point out the problem, what does it show?
              
              Never mind you can get it even if I posted qns at BPJ, the timing of the Woodlands Extension and label it as noises.. because you only want to see what you want to see... Or is it you dun understand because simply you dunno how to plan things...
              
              Never mind also... By hurling vulgarity at people and be saying AMK only what... It goes to show about you... You're very likely to heck care abt people's COI report abt the AMK Stn or whatever place, it goes to show about you..

              Not to mention how LTA plans bus int these days.. As to what I said, up to your to take it.. LTA dun need to specify anything, you take by how they plan it... If they need to intervene, they might have rather nationalise SBST &amp; SMRT...
