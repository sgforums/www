Sliding down a snow slope, walking together for long distances, sleeping in tents at night and a Eucharistic celebration outdoors were some of the unforgettable moments for the 100 youths from 20 parishes that took part.<br><br>The highlight of the Youth Week was the Youth Fest. The festival providied a platform to affirm youth and their talents. The festival kicked off at noon with a carnival bustling with games and food, live performances by bands at the talent corner and an on-site music station controlled by DJs. There was also an hour-long live chat discussing youth issues. The grand finale of the day was the evening rally cum Eucharistic celebration under the stars.<br><br>The Youth Week affirmed our youth that they matter to Jesus and our Church.<br><br>See photos in the <a href="http://cayc.org/CMS/index.php?option=com_zoom&amp;Itemid=30" rel="nofollow">YMO photo gallery.</a><br>See &amp; download <a href="http://cayc.org/CMS/images/stories/Youthwalk_group.jpg" rel="nofollow">Youth Walk group photo (556kB)</a>.<br><br>(Information taken from CAYC)</div>
