            <div class='col-md body'>Next on D&amp;D, at around 10pm, we began to dance at the dance floor. I actually don't want to join them because I am too shy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But later on, my friends asked me to dance and to join in the fun. But later on, some of the girls wanted to take a rest when they felt exhausted after dancing for about 1 hr. But the boys continue while the D&amp;D organisers invited them to join in again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>While I dance with my friends, JOSEPHINA asked me to dance with AUDREY but she is a bit scared of me. So instead, I went up to the stage to support AUDREY &amp; her other friends. They are from Apex-LW'21 youth group. (formerly known as LIVING WATERS). When I felt exhausted, I usually drink Coke (at least 4 cups!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I felt that it is fun, excited, and enjoyable for the D&amp;D. But I know it ends around 12.45am and I reached home at 1.30am.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>---END OF STORY---<br><br>NOTE: Do not circulate this message through e-mail.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">BRIEF HISTORY OF LIVING WATERS &amp; CORNERSTONE</span></strong><br><br>LIVING WATERS was formed in 1976 while CORNERSTONE was formed in 1969. LIVING WATERS was since changed its name to Apex-LW'21 in 2005 recently. Although they still uses the old name, it is still a church youth group member.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>As for the private fantasy bus companies, APEX BUS CO. was set up in 1974 and LIVING WATERS BUS NETWORK in 1979. Both fantasy bus companies were at Jurong Interchange in 1979. In 2004, finally merged as Apex-LW'21 Bus Services in 2004 before the youth group Living Waters in 2005.<br><br>PRISCILLA joined Living Waters in 2000 and elected as a President in 2003 as the former president of Living Waters was retired on the same year. He joined this group in 1986 and he has made the youth group to be more enjoyable and have plenty of youth activities. As the group looks into recruiting new members, all existing members will have to go, with 20 ex-Living Waters members of 1984-1988 are now at EDM.<br><br>As for Cornerstone in 1969, nothing to say about its history. I honestly don't like the rules of Cornerstone in 1969, the members were quite strict then. While the Cornerstone were helping out in camps, they treat the participants very strict. If they failed to observe the rules, they may be asked to leave the campsite. Luckily, they had retired in 1981. Not until in 1997, all Cornerstone members of 1980-1986 were retired and they are joining another youth group in different parishes. The Cornerstone in 1969 were believed to be from Cheng Chi School and becomes a church youth group in 1980.<br><br>As for Living Waters, formed in 1976 by Cheng Chi School (Stephen Lee Rd), a group that was not so popular at that time. It started with 40 students from Cheng Chi School and the president for this group is one male Chinese teacher. They have to follow strict curfews, attachments and other activities organised by the teachers. If they were late for meetings, they may be punished severely. If they don't listen to any meetings or to participate in any youth activities, without giving any reasons, whether you have family activities or whatever, they will also be punished.<br><br>In 1978, Living Waters became the youth group of Church of St Anthony, the priest Fr Cyprien Huc (now deceased), was holding on to this group. About 90 youths joined this group in 1978 and rose up to 130 in 1981. As Cheng Chi School closed, the members (including the president of this group) became the member of the youth group of the church. It means that Living Waters is not formed by the church when it first conducted its meetings in 1976.<br><br>Followed by the 1st Youth Walk in 1983 by CAYC, there are 50 Cornerstone members and 21 Living Waters members took part. As the 1st Youth Walk was not so adventurous, they had to walk and pass by most villages (eg. CCK Village). They decided not to take part for the 2nd time in 1984 until 1990.<br><br>Living Waters began to retire all 1976-1980 members in mid-1990. This was to implement that more new members will be joining in this group, by then the group cannot cope with about 140 members in 1990.<br><br>For Cornerstone, there are about 250 members in 1988. Due to large scale of youths in Cornerstone, they were separated in shifts.<br><br>Cornerstone &amp; Living Waters began conducting meetings and youth activities in English because very few youths from Mandai can speak in Chinese or in dialects. It was only that in 1989, they stopped conducting it in Chinese and its dialects. (It means that Cornerstone &amp; Living Waters were conducting its meetings in Chinese &amp; Teochew in the 1970s &amp; the 1980s.)<br><br>In 1993, the new church-raising fund at Woodlands Ave 1 was set-up. Living Waters had its last attachment on St Anthony's Feast Day in Mandai. The group contributes about $32,840/= for the building fund while Cornerstone donates about $57,385/=.<br><br>Cornerstone &amp; Living Waters had its another retirement exercise in 1997. 140 Cornerstone members in 1980-1986 and 74 Living Waters members in 1982-1986 were retired in 1998. The ex-Cornerstone members were allocated to EDM and some other youth groups from various parishes.<br><br>In 2002, Cornerstone had to withdraw 61 members of 1987-1990 as they want new members to join in and to open up to every youths who don't belong to any youth groups.<br><br>In Apr 2003, the president of Living Waters was replaced by PRISCILLA. This marked the start of the retirement of 159 members in 1984-1988 with first 31 members in 1984 began to retire.<br><br>Until Nov 2003, AUDREY &amp; AMANDA joined Living Waters. They thought that it would be useful youth groups that will reached out to people, while the 45 members of 1989-1996 were hibernating and didn't do anything.<br><br>As for 2004, all 45 members (excluding the 71 members who resigned), were withdrawn as since Fr Terence Pereira is looking on to new members to join Living Waters. It is sad to see all their friends were gone. Remembering one member in 1991, he thought that he will be joining another group, EDM @ CAYC. There are about 20 members of Living Waters in 2004, since the Cornerstone celebrates its 35th Anniversary.<br><br>In 2005, Living Waters had its name changed to Apex-LW'21. Apex was a sub-group of Cornerstone, and it always gained some experience to Living Waters. Apex-LW'21 is a merged group as if it is 'friends' between the two groups. It is now a popular church youth group that teaches us to write reports or to go for attachments, while the name 'LIVING WATERS' still retains.<br><br>Followed by the 1st Youth Camp in 1988 and the 1st Mt Ophir Trip (Gunung Ledang, located in Malaysia) in 1990, the trip was a success for more than 15 years! About 75 of the members do participate for this event, as well as the 1st Walkathon in 1984. (Route for Walkathon 1984: From Stephen Lee Rd and loop at Chong Pang Village, Sembawang)<br><br>Next year, Apex-LW'21 will be celebrating its 30th Anniversary.</div>
