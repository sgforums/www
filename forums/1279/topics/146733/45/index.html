            <div class='col-md body'><br>here is evidence to show tht our grand high emperor is big a$$hole one even AFTER death threat...<br><br>[quote]<br>Jul 10 2006, 11:26 AM<br><br>About the Shek Ngai thing<br>ok for those inquisitive souls that want to know about the juicy details of the quarrel that day... can do so here... see i'm such a nice person... seriously if u were in class that day u wouldn't have missed me storming out in class... unless you are blind, deaf or simply ignorant of your surroundings... but anyway here goes:<br><br>you know when Mr Tan came in to give the report cards... then he took up this slip of paper and started reading it... anyway here it is:<br><br>"i shall repeat myself... "sweet 16; i shall murder the one that said that..."<br><br>it was after this sentence that i stormed out of the class... if you were wondering where i went i went to the girls's bathroom just beside the class and i went to the toilet because my bladder was full... LOL (sorry did i just spoil everything?) then i sat on the chair thinking of ways to murder shek ngai until 2 girls came in and started staring at me... maybe because i was looking murderous or something... i was so annoyed i went out... a few seconds later Aini and Zahara came out...<br><br>that was when i started crying... not because i was sad... but because i was angry... i don't think u can imagine the immerse anger i was feeling that time... unless it happened to you... actually, initially i thought it was Mr Tan who printed out the paper... and Shek Ngai that sent it... (that i confirm) that was why i stormed out of the class... if i had known that Shek Ngai did it i would have took the paper and tore it into half and thrown it at his face... but it was him after all... oops sorry Mr Tan!<br><br>so we were outside the science lab... and i was crying and cursing Shek Ngai and Mr Tan ( i apologised already ok) for printing out and reading out the paper... seriously it was an act of disrespect... so i was so fucking pissed off... especially at Shek Ngai... because i didn't expect him to print out the bloody post without my permission... of all people he had to offend lao niang... i think he wants to die early or something... so the three of us were there cursing them at how blogging was like a daily diary and bloggers could write anything in their blog... copying the post is actually an illegal act and the bugger can be sued until he wets his pants... seriously i wasn't joking when i thought of sueing him... but i decided to beat the crap out of him first...<br><br>so momentarily Vivien appeared... ( i dunno why but she says Mr Tan sent her) by that time i'd stopped crying and proceded to think of my revenge.... (muahaha) then Aini suggested that they should talk to Shek Ngai, and that i should stand aside least it became physical (oh my manicured nails!!)... but they went back to take their report book for me and for themselves and took my bag with them... then Vivien started complaining about Marsela and bla... i don't think i was listening... because i started to become angry again... and i swore i wanted him to apologise to me in front of the whole class which he will be doing during the extended programme...<br><br>well so we spent the rest of the time chatting outside of the toilet and then Baizura came... and it began to become a bit more interesting... Baizura together with us conspired to talk to Shek Ngai after school... and more people came... particularly Pristine and Linette... because they wanted to know what happened... anyway... so the bell rang very soon...<br><br>and i went back into the class and everyone was like O_O... and<br><br>ok Kel i'm sorry i pushed you and said GET LOST...<br><br>i was angry ok... i am a frigging hot headed person... what can i do i have my father's alleles!! and here is the behind the scenes footage of what happened when the class dismissed (deng deng deng deng )<br><br>we have the accused: which is me, the prosecutor: Shek Ngai, the defendant: me again, the judge: Mr Tan and the jury: Aini, Zahara, Baizura, Vivien and Yan Xiu...<br>ok i don't really remember how it started but Shek Ngai was talking to Mr Tan and was laughing at something i don't remember i remembered Bai joining in and i wanted to tell her to zip on that topic and started the mission... and i was hissing to myself on how if he continues to not shut his mouth i will scream at him... then Aini was telling me to calm down...<br><br>then i think Mr Tan told Shek Ngai if he was aware that there were other people that wanted to talk to him and himself... he slapped forehead and said "Oh!... sorry~" so if i remembered correctly, Aini was the first speaker... and she asked him why he complained or something...<br><br>then i think she asked Mr Tan if he printed it out...<br><br>at that time upon seeing the face of my nemesis i was obviously angered... so i raised my hand and said: " Shek Ngai and i ask you something? did you print out this post? did u specifically copied the entire post and ctrl C ctrl V and pasted it on microsoft word and saved it, and then send it to Mr Tan?"<br><br>he was grinning for some freaky reason... i don't want to know why... and very cheekily said "Yes, i did... but i ......" i interupted him from his crap and said " so you admit from copying from MY blog..." he kept quiet... then i proceded to say " Can i ask you how did u feel when Khai took the picture from YOUR photobucket account and stole your bandwith?"<br><br>he said " i was angry because she didn't ask for my permission..." so i was like " oh so you were angry? then how does this situationn differ from yours? how is it that you have the right to be angry and that i do not?" then the jury agreed saying "people have feelings too~"<br><br>you know what i'll write it in script form... it's so annoying to type it out this way:<br><br>SN: ..... silence doesn't say anything<br>Mel: did u open up MY blog and saw on the left columm that the blog belonged to me? did u see "name: melissa there?"<br>SN: yes~ i think i did<br>Mel: then did you scroll down and saw a tagboard there?<br>SN: certainly<br>Mel: do you see me online Shek Ngai? did you see my email address angel devil haha? i may have put my status to busy but u did see my online right?<br>SN: yes~<br>Mel: oh! so of the many million times u saw me online, u didn't bother to raise the issue with me, but u bothered to go behind MY back and tell the teacher, raising your complains about what i wrote...<br>SN: is silent<br>Mel: ::takes paper:: you read it only once right? how did u think i was feeling when i wrote this?<br>SN: more silence...<br>Mel: *quotes from own post i shall repeat myself... then the first person that said Happy Birthday was rui ping... then elaine came... i think they forgot about my birthday because when we went to school...<br>at this point i started crying again... so pai sei o///O<br>Mel: what do you think i was feeling at that point of time when i wrote this?<br>Aini: a blog is for people to vent their anger you know... a diary... how can you do this...<br>Mel: we all take ss right? don't you think that i may be biased and that i was frigging pissed that day? u read it only once, without understanding and you come and point your finger at me.<br>yes and here i seriously break down into tears and started sobbing... even more pai sei o///O<br>Aini: Shek Ngai, you promised to be better to your classmates... but you made mel cry you know... so how?<br>Shek Ngai:..... is still silent.<br>Zahara: and not only melissa you know? you offended a lot of people... remember you called me useless...<br>at this point mel has stopped sobbing yay to me<br>SN (in defensive mode): that was because the class notice board was done so slowly<br>Mr Tan (steps in): but u shouldn't have subjected it to the person...<br>SN: Oh!<br>Mel (upon recovering composure): excuse me i was in charge of the board last year... and who helped us? only the both of us...<br>Aini: and me<br>Mel: ok three people... and sec three... we had more subjects we had piles of homework... we had tests... we can't simply neglect our work and do the class notice board just because of that reason...<br>Zahara: u call us useless, then when you were in charge of the bio board?<br>Mel: there waas perpetually nothing on the board except the BIOLOGY that Bai wrote<br>Bai: laughs, damm funny lahx<br>SN: i wanted to put something out there but MARSELA stops me (kinda pissed off)<br>Mel: don't you think you should ignore her since you are in charge? you insisted on you role and you didn't fulfill it? what does that make you?<br>Zahara: and when u offended other people you hurt them too you know... when u scolded matthew he was very angry with you...<br>Mel and Aini: and Hao Pei? remember?<br>SN: ::smacks forehead:: i have forgotten<br>Mel: u forgot O_O<br>Mr Tan: there are some people that just come to forget these things...<br>Mel: you complain to the teachers and then you forget after hurting other people?<br>Zahara: you do it too often you forget...<br><br>-momentarily silent-<br><br>Mel: you were offended because i called you an asshole...<br>SN: *agitate and starts blabbering<br>Mel: i call Aini a bitch everyday... i tell Zahara to go and die but u think i mean it?

"sweet 16; i shall murder the one that said that..."<br><br>it was after this sentence that i stormed out of the class... if you were wondering where i went i went to the girls's bathroom just beside the class and i went to the toilet because my bladder was full... LOL (sorry did i just spoil everything?) then i sat on the chair thinking of ways to murder shek ngai until 2 girls came in and started staring at me... maybe because i was looking murderous or something... i was so annoyed i went out... a few seconds later Aini and Zahara came out...<br><br>that was when i started crying... not because i was sad... but because i was angry... i don't think u can imagine the immerse anger i was feeling that time... unless it happened to you... actually, initially i thought it was Mr Tan who printed out the paper... and Shek Ngai that sent it... (that i confirm) that was why i stormed out of the class... if i had known that Shek Ngai did it i would have took the paper and tore it into half and thrown it at his face... but it was him after all... oops sorry Mr Tan!<br><br>so we were outside the science lab... and i was crying and cursing Shek Ngai and Mr Tan ( i apologised already ok) for printing out and reading out the paper... seriously it was an act of disrespect... so i was so fucking pissed off... especially at Shek Ngai... because i didn't expect him to print out the bloody post without my permission... of all people he had to offend lao niang... i think he wants to die early or something... so the three of us were there cursing them at how blogging was like a daily diary and bloggers could write anything in their blog... copying the post is actually an illegal act and the bugger can be sued until he wets his pants... seriously i wasn't joking when i thought of sueing him... but i decided to beat the crap out of him first...<br><br>so momentarily Vivien appeared... ( i dunno why but she says Mr Tan sent her) by that time i'd stopped crying and proceded to think of my revenge.... (muahaha) then Aini suggested that they should talk to Shek Ngai, and that i should stand aside least it became physical (oh my manicured nails!!)... but they went back to take their report book for me and for themselves and took my bag with them... then Vivien started complaining about Marsela and bla... i don't think i was listening... because i started to become angry again... and i swore i wanted him to apologise to me in front of the whole class which he will be doing during the extended programme...<br><br>well so we spent the rest of the time chatting outside of the toilet and then Baizura came... and it began to become a bit more interesting... Baizura together with us conspired to talk to Shek Ngai after school... and more people came... particularly Pristine and Linette... because they wanted to know what happened... anyway... so the bell rang very soon...<br><br>and i went back into the class and everyone was like O_O... and<br><br>ok Kel i'm sorry i pushed you and said GET LOST...<br><br>i was angry ok... i am a frigging hot headed person... what can i do i have my father's alleles!! and here is the behind the scenes footage of what happened when the class dismissed (deng deng deng deng )<br><br>we have the accused: which is me, the prosecutor: Shek Ngai, the defendant: me again, the judge: Mr Tan and the jury: Aini, Zahara, Baizura, Vivien and Yan Xiu...<br>ok i don't really remember how it started but Shek Ngai was talking to Mr Tan and was laughing at something i don't remember i remembered Bai joining in and i wanted to tell her to zip on that topic and started the mission... and i was hissing to myself on how if he continues to not shut his mouth i will scream at him... then Aini was telling me to calm down...<br><br>then i think Mr Tan told Shek Ngai if he was aware that there were other people that wanted to talk to him and himself... he slapped forehead and said "Oh!... sorry~" so if i remembered correctly, Aini was the first speaker... and she asked him why he complained or something...<br><br>then i think she asked Mr Tan if he printed it out...<br><br>at that time upon seeing the face of my nemesis i was obviously angered... so i raised my hand and said: " Shek Ngai and i ask you something? did you print out this post? did u specifically copied the entire post and ctrl C ctrl V and pasted it on microsoft word and saved it, and then send it to Mr Tan?"<br><br>he was grinning for some freaky reason... i don't want to know why... and very cheekily said "Yes, i did... but i ......" i interupted him from his crap and said " so you admit from copying from MY blog..." he kept quiet... then i proceded to say " Can i ask you how did u feel when Khai took the picture from YOUR photobucket account and stole your bandwith?"<br><br>he said " i was angry because she didn't ask for my permission..." so i was like " oh so you were angry? then how does this situationn differ from yours? how is it that you have the right to be angry and that i do not?" then the jury agreed saying "people have feelings too~"<br><br>you know what i'll write it in script form... it's so annoying to type it out this way:<br><br>SN: ..... silence doesn't say anything<br>Mel: did u open up MY blog and saw on the left columm that the blog belonged to me? did u see "name: melissa there?"<br>SN: yes~ i think i did<br>Mel: then did you scroll down and saw a tagboard there?<br>SN: certainly<br>Mel: do you see me online Shek Ngai? did you see my email address angel devil haha? i may have put my status to busy but u did see my online right?<br>SN: yes~<br>Mel: oh! so of the many million times u saw me online, u didn't bother to raise the issue with me, but u bothered to go behind MY back and tell the teacher, raising your complains about what i wrote...<br>SN: is silent<br>Mel: ::takes paper:: you read it only once right? how did u think i was feeling when i wrote this?<br>SN: more silence...<br>Mel: *quotes from own post i shall repeat myself... then the first person that said Happy Birthday was rui ping... then elaine came... i think they forgot about my birthday because when we went to school...<br>at this point i started crying again... so pai sei o///O<br>Mel: what do you think i was feeling at that point of time when i wrote this?<br>Aini: a blog is for people to vent their anger you know... a diary... how can you do this...<br>Mel: we all take ss right? don't you think that i may be biased and that i was frigging pissed that day? u read it only once, without understanding and you come and point your finger at me.<br>yes and here i seriously break down into tears and started sobbing... even more pai sei o///O<br>Aini: Shek Ngai, you promised to be better to your classmates... but you made mel cry you know... so how?<br>Shek Ngai:..... is still silent.<br>Zahara: and not only melissa you know? you offended a lot of people... remember you called me useless...<br>at this point mel has stopped sobbing yay to me<br>SN (in defensive mode): that was because the class notice board was done so slowly<br>Mr Tan (steps in): but u shouldn't have subjected it to the person...<br>SN: Oh!<br>Mel (upon recovering composure): excuse me i was in charge of the board last year... and who helped us? only the both of us...<br>Aini: and me<br>Mel: ok three people... and sec three... we had more subjects we had piles of homework... we had tests... we can't simply neglect our work and do the class notice board just because of that reason...<br>Zahara: u call us useless, then when you were in charge of the bio board?<br>Mel: there waas perpetually nothing on the board except the BIOLOGY that Bai wrote<br>Bai: laughs, damm funny lahx<br>SN: i wanted to put something out there but MARSELA stops me (kinda pissed off)<br>Mel: don't you think you should ignore her since you are in charge? you insisted on you role and you didn't fulfill it? what does that make you?<br>Zahara: and when u offended other people you hurt them too you know... when u scolded matthew he was very angry with you...<br>Mel and Aini: and Hao Pei? remember?<br>SN: ::smacks forehead:: i have forgotten<br>Mel: u forgot O_O<br>Mr Tan: there are some people that just come to forget these things...<br>Mel: you complain to the teachers and then you forget after hurting other people?<br>Zahara: you do it too often you forget...<br><br>-momentarily silent-<br><br>Mel: you were offended because i called you an asshole...<br>SN: *agitate and starts blabbering<br>Mel: i call Aini a bitch everyday... i tell Zahara to go and die but u think i mean it?

You will be doing yourself a favour, and the people around you.<br><br>I have been reading the various stuff bandied about about you in here and SinBus, and I have tried to keep a neutral stand.  But this really takes the cake.  You need HELP.  You cannot just isolate yourself in 1 corner and condemn the rest around you.</div>
