            <div class='col-md body'>WOW! I didn't expect so much replies after one night..<br><br>anyway, my thoughts about this service..<br><br>instead of just using the *655 service, SBST can also use it on the WAP page.. In that way, not just SingTel customers can use, even M1 and StarHub customers can. But they must know the WAP page URL first. the *652 service (Bus guide) was also available on WAP and received quite a bit of hits. Yup nowadays I use the WAP service rather than using the *SEND service which will set me back by $1 for every request (because I search for several buses at once).<br><br>second, if service 518's estimated time arrival plates are displayed along the route, why not implement this service on 2 or 3 services which have long frequencies (around 18-25 mins) and more highly utilised. This way, it would be better to gauge the usage of this new service rather than using on a sole route.<br><br>third, if talks with M1 and StarHub <strong>were being carried out</strong>, why don't we see SBST implement their bus guide service on their networks for the past 3 years where *652 was in operation?<br><br>fourth, why hasn't SMRT come up with the phone bus guide service, so that passengers using SMRT Buses can benefit? Don't think we can expect them to jump onto the bandwagon of next bus arrival immediately.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, I think SMRT (formerly Tibs) needs to try out such a system if SBST is successful. Putting the bus arrival times on WAP could be a good idea if it can be made available to all mobile users.<br><br>But perhaps bus stops @ major landmarks can have bus arrival times put up on the signposts. This is a common sight in the Perth region where I am currently based.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last time i tried using singtel GPRS to locate e buses around me. Came back w a list of bus nos that r operating in AMK n non in my area!!! Even though I was next to Bishan int @ that pt of time!!!!!<br><br>N e other option is 2 find e bus no 2 ur destination fm where u r nw. So u just enter ur destination pt n e embarking pt u can choose auto, that means they themselves detect where u r. HAHAHAH Came back to me again w a list of numbers I could take fm AMK n transfer thereafter. Hello, I was standing @ Bishan central @ that time, nt AMK central.<br><br>In other words e system nt accurate!<br><br>Than u think when they track e location of e bus while travelling on e road will be accurate? Later like in this case, u r in bishan, e system thought u in amk.</div>
