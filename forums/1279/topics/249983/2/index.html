There is no aircon upon alighting and also, you don't get automatic glass doors. You have to push them open yourself. This applies the same for the boarding berths. Definetely troublesome for those who are carrying lots of heavy things on their hand.<br><br>The boarding berths are quite unwelcoming. It looks plain and outdated. Some dirt marks on the walls can be seen. You look to the outside of the interchange and could barely see a few buses. Some BCs resorted to switching on headlights to see more clearly.<br><br>Even after it opened for about four years already, there are still renovation works ongoing there. I saw some workers putting up what looks like some aircon ducts at the alighting berths weeks ago. The empty space behind Berth B4 (housing Services 83 and 86 queues) is also undergoing construction works. Lastly, the service guide rack at Sengkang Interchange is terrible. Nothing on 80, 163 or something else, just some guides I've seen before and in big stacks.<br><br>Outside the interchange, the condominium has been stained with soot from the buses exiting the interchange. Also, where can I find the best place to take photos of buses? I would say, not even a single one unless it's at the main road as the interchange is dark.<br><br>Any other comments?</div>

The first underground INTERCHANGE needs a lift so that i dont have to just take escalator and that the less able-ed can take buses too. (applies to 161/168 B9TLs only)<br>Changi Airport - Similar to Sengkang in the sense people have to bear with the carbon monoxide. But its worse because no aircon! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Geylang Lorong 1 - The boarding place is far from the road and dangerous to go when all the buses except 980 turn into lorong 1. Sometimes the smell is horrific.<br>Shenton Way - Where is it?!?! Under the ECP!??! The place isnt near the Tanjong Pagar MRT!</div>
