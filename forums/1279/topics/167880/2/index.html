            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">Looking at the traffic scheme, It is better for services to loop at Marina Centre. Why? first of all, take an example of sv133. It is a looping service. It stops at Exhibition centre and Carrefour. People can walk to Marina Square very easily. People going back home can also board at Exhibition centre and Carrefour. Convenient.<br><br>As for sv56/196/77/75/171/960... They alight at Pan Pacific. Those going to sun tec have to walk. When going back home, they have to walk all the way to Raffles Avenue/ Esplanade to board. If they are at Suntec, they whave to walk so far. some more Marina Centre cannot board/alight.<br><br>One idea is for Marina Terminal Service to commence service n such a way that it terminate like current 106, and commence like city bound 36.</div></blockquote>Sounds quite ok, but if you go to the Fountain of Wealth and observe, you'll see that the situation at the convention centre bus stop is really bad, since the entrance to the taxistand/pickup point/carpark is located like metres just before the busstop and the fact that a lot of cars enter that little sideroad doesn't help since the buses usually get stuck behind cars or the other way round when the queue at the bus stop stretches way back to the entrace of Temasek Blvd.<br><br>That being said, the roads of Suntec City (Temasek Blvd and Ave) look like they can't handle the sudden influx of buses and the potential traffic problems it could cause. The circus traffic can be really bad at shopping hours with the taxistands, pickup points, and the 3 exits all leading in or out of the circus.<br><br>Which is why the current system is still the best solution, unless you widen Temasek Blvd and Ave to become a giant 4 lane road in each direction and shift the offending cars away to somewhere. You'll get to windowshop at Marina Centre and see the Esplanade as well when you walk to the Esplanade busstop.<br><br>And of course they could always take 133/857/97/111 for a short trip to Raffles Ave</div>
