Hougang Ave 8 is some distance from NEL, taking bus and change to NEL will cost a lot.<br><br><blockquote>Which <strong>bus routes</strong> should be amended? Are they too long?</blockquote>171 too long, but neccessary for people in Bukit Panjang to get to Yishun.<br><br><blockquote>Are there duplication of <strong>bus services</strong>?</blockquote>77, 106 and 7 along Holland Rd.<br><br><blockquote>Do you think any <strong>bus services</strong> should be withdrawn or increased?</blockquote>No need.<br><br><blockquote>Are staggered bus stops a good idea?</blockquote>Not a problem to those who come to Orchard Rd very often. Those people who seldom come to Orchard Rd might get confused or lose their way.<br><br><blockquote>Are there too many or too few bus services serving Orchard Road?</blockquote>Quite ok, Orchard Rd too congested during Xmas and NY period.<br><br><blockquote>Should some bus services use only double deckers?</blockquote>65, 143, 7, 14.<br><br><blockquote>Do other bus services need bendys?</blockquote>167 ( To serve people in Upper Thomson and Sembawang, alternative to 162.<br><br><blockquote>Are major residential areas well-connected to Orchard Road?</blockquote>No, Hougang Ave 8 does not have a direct bus to Orchard Rd, due to NEL.<br>Pasir Ris also no bus to Orchard Rd ( Is 518 operating for the whole day? )<br><blockquote>What are your experiences taking the bus to/from Orchard Road?</blockquote>Centrepoint bus stop should be common bus stop for all buses, but it will be prone to congestion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA did a major study sometime back to improve the congestion problem. But.. sigh...<br><br>I think the biggest improvement that shd be done is to move all bus stops to the right of Orchard Road, similar to the bus stop arrangement outside Orchard MRT along Orchard Blvd.<br><br>Most congestion is caused by cars turning left into the 2 CTE entrances, as well as into shopping centres like PS. Buses need to filter right to get pass, resulting in the centre lanes slowing down.<br><br>Whether there is sufficient space on the right of Orchard Road is highly subjective.  I think there is.<br><br>For example, I am sure Ngee Ann city won't mind sacrificing some of the open space in front of their complex to make a bus bay. There are URA carparks on both sides of Specialist Shopping Centre to accomodate a bus bay, same for the green space opposite Meridien. Even the space above Dhoby Ghaut MRT is available.<br><br>Also.. bus lanes should be applied 24 hours along Orchard Road, since the regular Bus Lane hours do not match the peak hours at Orchard Road.<br><br></div>

And travel by Sometset Road, Grange Road and Orchard Boulevard.<br><br>Forgo the busstop at Orchard LInk totally. Don't you think that the jams are at the junction between Sometset and Grange road? It was caused by vehicles from grange road clogging the junction by turning right into Somerset Road??? Despite the yellow boxes, the vehicles still clog the junction, thus buses move little despite green light and causes jams along sometset road. Let the buses turn left into Grange Road and that would result in lesser jam.<br><br></div>
