As long as anyone's opinion is sensible (Which I feel PJ_Quek's is), anyone is free to voice them out. In this case, PJ_Quek didnt say anything that is not decent or of inapporpiate content, thus, I dont see the need to be belligerent to him. If you cant stand his completely legitimate opinions, just ignore him and get on with your life, because, it doesnt help at all to insult him in such a manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Silverkris, please use some sense.<br><br>This is wat u said<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">That's why we have topics like "Memorable bus rides" or "you prefer sbst or smrt" or "where have all the passengers gone" or "what bus posessions did you collect" or "do you think sbst and smrt future routes will all be express ones" or "if you were a BC, which interchange/terminal would you avoid" or "which is your favourite bus captain uniform" etc....you get the idea.<br><br>ALL topics which are subjective, and based on one's experiences, opinions and reflections. </span><br><br>When you have topics like You prefer this or that, Which interchange/terminal you avoid and blah...by asking people to pick a preference there will be a tendency to lead to a quarrel...i'm just pointing this out...seriously...at the end of the day you are the troublemaker who starts topics like this.  I would advise you to stay way because if you are going to start more opinion topics which might cause debates and subsequently veer off into arguments, you are not definitely not welcome.  As I said you wanna invite opinions do it in the private.  Period.  Why can't you do that then?<br><br>And you can't speak for me Silverkris, you are not me.  You cannot say that I cannot stand the fact that people have opinions.<br><br>Let me ask you how useful are your contribution Silverkris?  What help have you been?  Have you provided any information or anything of this kind?  Ask yourself.<br><br>As for PJ Quek suggestion let me shoot it down from the business point of view.  Maybe you think I buy what SBS Transit has to say or what.  But from the business sense, PJ Quek doesn't make any sense.  The whole idea of network rationalisation in the NE corridor is to prevent duplication (yes yes 502 hardly duplicates the NEL) but the whole idea is for commuters to use the NEL...the NEL has yet to break even...and it's definitely not in good business to duplicate resources and end up in a lose-lose situation for a company.  Of course I would like 502 reinstated...it was a very convenient service for me.  But if you look at the bigger picture or in the business sense...if people dun break the habit of using the NEL...the under-utilisation of the NEL would cause SBS Transit to lose $$...they have to account to shareholders...and I am sure you know most businesses have to make a profit...if losses are mounting...the only way to do is to raise fares.  Then we grumble and curse.<br><br>Express 502 was definitely quite a cash-cow for SBS Transit...unwilling they may be in shortening the route, they had to for the sake of reducing losses.<br><br>Of course different parties have their own different interests...commuters want convenience...companies want profits...firstly try to see the forest or the big picture.<br><br>What PJ Quek say is suggesting is from an own personal interests.  502 was my direct bus from Orchard.  I am not grumbling or what.  It's a matter of taking an alternative...as for no connections between Hg/SK/S'goon to Orc...use the NEL.<br><br>Hg Ave 8 is not an exclusive area that 502 must serve.  There are other populous areas in HG as well.</div>

The kerb which this traffic lamp post is the cause of everything! if LTA just remove this kerb and move the traffic lamp post inner, the whole lane can be utilised! Buses need not be stuck at the junction[somerset &amp; grange rd]. If you guys do drop by there, you will notice what i am saying</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My two cents worth on service 16:<br><br>Service 16 seems to have more than its fair share of controversies. Many were unhappy when it took over the route of 390 to the airport. Some complained when 36 was introduced from Bukit Merah later, and now 36 has taken over roughly the same route of the former 390, and operates a similar route as 16 from town.<br><br>Perhaps the routes of 16 and 36 can be amended to become complementary, so that 16 can use DDs? i.e. avoiding narrow lanes and height gantries.<br><br>Not too sure if it'll work.

            <div class='col-md body'>Woodlands is seriously lacking in a bus link to Orchard Rd, simply because of the MRT. I may still have direct link 95x if not for the MRT, but what's done can't be undone. But that aside, sometimes, it's kinda tough having the same operator operating both trains and buses to major places. Even the slightest duplication cannot be passed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

In 1993, services 31 (Tampines - Stadium Blvd) and 149 (Toa Payoh - Changi Airport) were merged. As a result, service 16 was extended to the airport to cover service 149 route from Marine Parade to the airport. Service 390 (Changi Airport - Tomlinson Rd) was withdrawn with service 16 as the alternative service. However, soon, service 390 passengers were complaining that with the amendment, they had to take service 16 to the airport which resulted in a longer travelling time. The press published the complaint and this "forced" SBST to introduce one-directional-peak-hours service 16E (Semi-express between Bt Merah - Changi Airport) not long after, which plied express along ECP, Rochor Rd/Ophir Rd, Beach Rd between the airport and City Hall MRT. <strong>In Dec 1997, service 16E was re-numbered service 36 with route and operating hours un-changed.</strong> Then in Sep 1998, service 36 route was amended to become the route today and changed its operation hours to a full day service, and service 16 route was shortened to Marine Parade on the same day.<br><br><strong>Service 36 did ply Bt Merah - Changi Airport from Dec 1997 to Sep 1998. During that period, it duplicated service 16 between Bt Merah interchange and Stamford Rd/Bras Basah Rd during the peak hours. Before Dec 1997, service 36 is numbered service 16E. </strong><br><br><strong>For more information on service 36 (Bt Merah - Changi Airport), please check the 1998 Transitlink guide. </strong></span><br><br>Actually I am a bit stunned that: 1. tranquilice knows his bus history like no one's business; and 2. that this "someone" (who prefers not to be named) can point out a paragraph that was written 10 months ago!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I remember taking Svc 36 from Bukit Merah, but I am quite certain I wouldn't be able to recount the entangled history of 16/16E/36/390.

            <div class='col-md body'>I live in the Serangoon North area. Bus service 502 was the only bus in 1999 that went to Orchard Road. Later in 2003, after the rationalisation of bus services due to NEL, bus 502 no longer ply the serangoon area. Besides that, before the NEL, bus services 111, 85 and 106  went to Orchard Road from the Hougang and Serangoon and the Sengkang area. Since the NEL is built, sigh, these three bus services are all affected.<br><br>I sincerely hope that there is a bus service that goes from Orchard Road to  Serangoon, Hougang, Sengkang or even Punggol areas.<br><br>By the way, bus service 89 does not go to Orchard Road as in 2nd of January 2005. It goes to Changi Airport Cargo Complex via Pasir Ris and Sengkang areas.</div>
