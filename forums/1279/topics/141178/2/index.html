            <div class='col-md body'>From the beginning to now, CAIX you have been making excuses for yourself.  Honestly, the more you defend your actions, the more guilty you make yourself become to be.<br><br>This is not an argument.  I am just pointing out the inadequacy and folly of his actions.  I am also clearly explained to him why his actions are deemed inconsiderate.  It becomes an arguement as CAIX is defending his actions with so many excuses.  You can't even own up to your mistakes.<br><br>BTW you are accountable and responsible for your own actions.  I don't see why you have to bring others into the picture.  So if you see someone steal something, does it give you the excuse to steal...and when you get caught, exclaim, but he also stole what.  Why am I being ticked off here.  So does it make you less guilty?  I doubt not.<br><br>Well, if you still refuse to admit your mistake, there's nothing anyone can do about it.  It just reflects on your moral values and your character.  I can only wish you good luck.<br><br>Personally I take around 3 guides per service, be it rare or not.
