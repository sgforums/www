            <div class='col-md body'>And now for a short break from bus talk- we turn to a weather report:<br><br>Windy_hates_B10TLs (in Sydney according to profile) said to SilverKris<br><blockquote>The uniform maybe? stinking hot and humid singapore would be more like it.</blockquote>It's interesting even the climate is a reason for derogatory and snotty language, especially where Singapore is concerned. It's almost as if one is expected to be able to change equatorial/tropical weather, or weather anywhere in the world. One rarely hears Sydneysiders complain about summer with such hostility during my decade there- even though there are long, sweaty, consecutive hot days of 38c, or the big and fat flies which compel one to perform the Aussie wave....in fact many look forward to the beach in 3-4 months of summer weather and other relaxing pursuits- humidity or no humidity.<br><br>Two Norwegian friends who have grown up in cold climates all their lives, esp. with short days and long nights in winter talk about depression, the bitter cold with cracked and dry skin, burst plumbing and sewerage pipes, increase in suicides during winter, and their anticipation of long warm holidays in Singapore.<br><br>People in other countries accept their regional weather matter-of-factly...whether in London where it rains and is cloudy regularly, or Australia where the high UVB exposure has given Australians the dubious distinction of having the highest skin cancer rates in the world. Even those who live in (and enjoy) climates with four seasons in Europe have fatal heat waves to contend with in summer (e.g. the more than 5000 French nationals who died from the summer heat wave in 2002), and snow storms in winter.<br><br>No one is ever happy with the weather, not Aussies with year long water restrictions, floods, drought and hail ...or Singaporeans  who bear with the high humidity. Singaporeans can perhaps choose to look at the positive side of things- no typhoons, snow storms, heat waves, hail or dangerous icy roads.<br><br>While it is highly bizzare to talk about the climate with such animosity, it is perhaps a reflection of one's dysfunctional mindset.<br><br>If I may <span style="font-style: italic;">impulsively</span> articulate my thoughts on this: Singaporeans who live abroad and complain about the weather back home have perhaps developed an inexplicable superiority complex, and think themselves too good for the climate here. It is then just a common psychological <span style="font-style: italic;">illness </span>-bashing things Singaporean. Foreigners who do so are just oblivious to the unpredictability and risks of weather in their own region.<br><br><blockquote>Hmmm, your nick is a little too close to mine for comfort</blockquote>I have no problems with your nick, and you are quite free to use another nick if you think it's too <span style="font-style: italic;">similar</span> to mine for your liking.<br><br>And now...back to bus talk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I begin my reply, may I just say that clearly you are either at work and very bored, or you have an awful lot of time on your hands.  But that's ok <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I have no complaints about weather generally, but the humidity just really gets to me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by WindyDay:</div><div class="quote_body">And now for a short break from bus talk- we turn to a weather report:<br><br><br>If I may impulsively articulate my thoughts on this: Singaporeans who live abroad and complain about the weather back home have perhaps developed an inexplicable superiority complex, and think themselves too good for the climate here.

So there is no superiority complex available.  Nor would I consider myself to be entirely foreign to Singapore, I have family over there, and I have made many frequent visits to classify Singapore under "nice place - wouldn't want to live there" (although it is not the onyl country which falls under that category).  Nor do I ever complain about the weather normally, but it was quite appropriate to add in a little comment which was made in jest (with a slight tinge of truth), quite unlike your off-topic rant which seems to characterise these forums.<br><br>I do however, have to say that I find that most local ppl think that reasonably cool air-conditioning is not suitable, and it needs to be 2 or 3 degrees warmer than the polar ice caps!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by WindyDay:</div><div class="quote_body">I have no problems with your nick, and you are quite free to use another nick if you think it's too <span style="font-style: italic;">similar</span> to mine for your liking.<br><br>And now...back to bus talk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div></blockquote>Well, you might just be in the minority there! I have had many a PM abusing my 'lack of taste' in buses.  Note, I don't like them, and I will never like (note, I don't get obsessed) anything for the mere fact that it is new, which is quite prevalent in the enthusiast community in Hong Kong and Singapore.  I mean, each to their own...  I just don't like them, and that's that.<br><br>Oh, and as for the comment about a dysfuntional mindset - yes, I do possess one.  It is called being a train, bus and aircraft enthusiast.  I hate all modes of transport, but something just compells me to take out my camera and take a photo of it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
