              <p>Think I will start a topic to discuss all these. Wonder how will the current fleets situation be like if no depot transfers ever took place in late 2004...</p>

              <p>100: Full K230UB fleet instead of having some MK4s in its fleet...</p>
              <p>105: More K230UBs then expected if AMDEP still controls partial duties.</p>
              <p>109: Full K230UB/Citaros if AMDEP controlled instead of HGDEP, BNDEP remains the same.</p>
              <p>82/103: Dunno if will suffer the same fate like 138 or not, due to road conditions at Seletar Camp as well as Punggol Rd End...</p>
              <p>101/158/315/317: Full K230UBs.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Eunos services</strong></span></p>
              <p>60: Might not have gone WAB, could have remained with MK3/MK4/VO3x fleets.</p>
              <p>63: Doesn't make any difference with a mixture of MK4/K230UBs in its fleet.</p>
              <p>94: Would remain as MK3/MK4 fleet without going WAB till today.</p>

              <p>100 still got plenty of KUB. If 100 would to be WAB, then it might have the chance to get KUB full fleet. 82 and 103 doubtfully will get KUB even if it's under AM, road condition cannot make it, although road inside Seletar had improved.</p>

              <p>Flamebait topic.</p>
              <p>Where you want to throw your B10Ms to?</p>
              <p>AMDEP?</p>
              <p>Share?</p>
              <p>You do realise that HGDEP's experience with B10Ms far outstrips AMDEP?</p>
              <p>If I were the CEO and I want to minimise the impact of any fleet renewal, SBST's strategy makes the most sense.</p>
              <p>Why spread the new buses around and the old ones also when you can replace them outright, let the recipient depot learn, let the depot with older buses carry on what they are good at, and then take in newer and IMPROVED batches of new buses with the experience from the other depots?</p>
              <p>Why can't you people see that its a win-win situation for the depots, and the company and people like us on the whole?</p>
              <p>And HGDEP is quite possibly resisting the switch to the newer buses and understandably so.</p>
              <p>Look at the mainteinance level of its oldest buses, the MKIIIs. The bus is still very much good to go like any newer bus!</p>
              <p>HGDEP really takes pride in its MKIIIs and B10Ms. Why would I not take pride in them as well?</p>

              <p>Actually, I think that the reason Serangoon is thrown over to HGDEP is becoz of NEL.</p>
              <p>Before NEL was born, it was considered that Lorong Chuan is next to AMK. And strictly speaking Lor Chuan is actually in S'goon. in other words, s'goon is just next to AMK.</p>
              <p>However, things changed after NEL opened in 2003. Serangoon was then misled that it is actually nearer to Hougang due to one single fact that Hougang was just two stops away on the NEL from Serangoon. And remember this: The circle line was NOT opened at that time, so people think that you can only reach AMK from S'goon through the city. Therefore, since they think it is nearer, S'goon ended up where it was today. </p>

                              <p>Actually, I think that the reason Serangoon is thrown over
              to HGDEP is becoz of NEL.</p>
              <p>Before NEL was born, it was considered that Lorong Chuan is next
              to AMK. And strictly speaking Lor Chuan is actually in S'goon. in
              other words, s'goon is just next to AMK.</p>
              <p>However, things changed after NEL opened in 2003. Serangoon was
              then misled that it is actually nearer to Hougang due to one single
              fact that Hougang was just two stops away on the NEL from
              Serangoon. And remember this: The circle line was NOT opened at
              that time, so people think that you can only reach AMK from
              S'goon through the city. Therefore, since they think it is
              nearer, S'goon ended up where it was today. </p>
                            </div>
                          </blockquote>reason is NEL but your supporting paragraph is flawed. Serangoon under hgdep is due to rail breakdown replacement. Easier to despatch buses if all the NE interchanges are under one depot, with assistance from amdep and bndep, as well as slbp and bbdep for the southern stations.<br>

              <p>I think that services 11 and 64 should go under BRBP controlled instead, together with all the St Mikes routes. Whereas Eunos routes return back to HGDEP. In return some Sengkang/Punggol routes (85, 159, 161, 163) that terminates along NSL corridors will be either partial or fully transfer over to AMDEP.</p>

              This is nothing new in SBS history.
              There is a reason why Ang Mo Kio gets the majority of the older Mercedes Benz buses like the OF1413s and 1417s and Bedok and Hougnag gets more Volvo B57 than other depots. Logic still applies till now.

There is a reason why Ang Mo Kio gets the majority of the older Mercedes Benz buses like the OF1413s and 1417s and Bedok and Hougnag gets more Volvo B57 than other depots. Logic still applies till now.</p>
