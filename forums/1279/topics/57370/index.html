Incidentally TIB1126Y is now also at KJDEP after being replaced by TIB1232Z.<br><br>Initially TIB1050G served on svc 190 after moving to KJDEP but now it is on 106.

            <div class='col-md body'>Can anyone kindly tell me why TIB 1024 C is such a special bus? By right, it should be a Habit (TIB 1019 Z to TIB 1023 K) are, and so is TIB 1025.

Anyway, I think that it is the first bendy bus to be using the Voith Gearbox, not until the later, newer Habits joined the fleet. I last saw it on Service 913, I took it at night and the driver made some noise about me not getting off the bus, heehee. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Hence it is TIB1024H.<br><br>So you are asking why TIB1024H is sandwiched between the Habits? It went like this. The first Habit was TIB1025E not TIB1019Z. The numbers TIB1019Z to TIB1024H was left empty for a while. TIB1024H was TIB's Volgren Bendy prototype, and it came into play at about the same time as the TIB1041H - TIB1057M batch. As for why they slotted that Volgren into TIB1024H, I have no idea, but I guess TIB1019Z to TIB1024H regos was initially reserved for a few more Volgren bodied Dennis Lance 245's. However they kind of realised the Dennis Lance sucked big time so decided not to proceed with the Lance orders (thank heavens!). The TIB1019Z to TIB1023K habits were registered at the same time as the TIB1103M to TIB1120M habit batch, after they confirmed that they no longer needed that few rego's for any more Lances. Hence the Habits of TIB1019Z to TIB1023K are actually NEWER than the first TIB1025E batch, having about the same age as the TIB111X batch.</div>

This way the bus company could identify it easily. So it's not that funny though.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

If you are able to contact the company straight away, it is easier for them to contact the bus captain / service captain (Tibs) or the interchange the bus is terminating at to see if they can retrieve the item.</div>

Coz I noticed the bus licence no. plate, I managed to help my friend successfully retrieve his bag left behind the bus few yrs back! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

If you misplace your belongings you will be able to notify the relevant interchange, and ask them to check if they have found what you have lost. That would not have been possible without the number plate.</div>
