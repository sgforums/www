            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I wonder if Sv 3 would be MORE circutous after the extension. By looking at the present route of Sv 3. it's already so circutous that the driver feels so 'intolerable' when driving this route. It goes in and out of Tampines, and then goes in and out of Pasir Ris, and now it has to go in and out of Punggol! I must salute to Sv 3's drivers.</div>

Really could have been a nightmare... go macpherson, serangoon, then orchard (by that time should be anxiously looking at watch), then some more go chinatown, telok blangah, pasir panjang, turn circles in tanglin (oh dear already very late), then some more go holland and ulu pandan before winding up at Ngee Ann, super super late and butt ache.<br><br>That time was the SBS DM Volvo MK II's some more, lagi worse, bumpy and slow.
