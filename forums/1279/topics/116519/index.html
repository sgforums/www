Having seats (unless single deck) and fewer jams.<br><br>It's still faster to travel by bus ffrom holland to amk than to take train from bv to amk.<br><br>Doubt I will travel by CCL, from holland to bishan and than to amk and finally a bus to serangoon north.</div>

SMRT is more than happy that the trains are packed to the brim, and commuters have to wait for 6 minutes for a train. As a public listed company, SMRT skimmed and maximised returns for shareholders.<br><br>Not sure if you feel that SMRT service had deterioriated since Ms SAW take the helms.</div>
