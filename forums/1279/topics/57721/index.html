            <div class='col-md body'>Sembawang is indeed a growing town, with plenty of potential for new services. Unfortunately, one of the elements that the town lacks is a permanently fixed bus interchange. Currently, it houses two terminals: sembawang rd end and admiralty rd west. If there was an interchange, the existing services at the two terminals would be redeployed to serve the interchange. With the redeployment, tibs will be able to introduce feeder services to cover the routes of the existing amended services. There is a strong possibility that Tibs is in final preparations to introduce a new service possibly from Sembawang to the East possibly to Changi Village or Pasir Ris via Yishun. There are also talks that a temporary int would be built by end of next yr. I also would like to see Sembawang develop into a viable town with good transport links other than the MRT.</div>

Sv. 980 and Sv. 167 will be amended to terminate there, and feeder services will most likely be introduced. Sv. 965 may even terminate at Sembawang. Anything can happen!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, you know, that will be very good, in my opinion. With the new interchange, Service 167 can perhaps consist or a partial fleet of Bendies. The Pax load during peak hours are really great, sometimes the passengers have to stand all the way from Shenton Way to Orchard or Thomson. Some Bendies would make things better. But one concern is this: How is Service 167 going to serve Sembawang Beach? It is after all, quite a famous place, many people still make use of Service 167 to go there. Nonetheless, can the Bendies make a loop around the round-a-about like Jalan Kayu, and construct another new stop to indicate which direction the bus is travelling to?<br><br>Then there is Service 980: Will it cause inconvenience because the Admiralty Road West Terminal is too far away from Sembawang Central?<br><br>Or do you guys think that Service 858 can be extended to Sembawang, with the introduction of Bendies when the new terminal 3 is up? I hope that Transitlink or LTA will consider building a permanent interchange at T3 when it opens. It may take long, but at least it gives the drivers (e.g. from Service 36, 53, 27, etc) a break.

They dont even bother to bolster the 167 fleet even on a temporary basis during peak hours. One habit used to serve on 167 for a period on a trial basis.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AntiDennisLance:</div><div class="quote_body">167 currently can already take bendies - just that they didnt feel the load is enough. They dont even bother to bolster the 167 fleet even on a temporary basis during peak hours. One habit used to serve on 167 for a period on a trial basis. Remember even service 82 used to have bendies even at the cramped Punggol End terminal. Unlike service 804, bendies are safe on 167.<br><br>Even if there is a new terminal at T3, service 858 still cannot take bendies as it still has to pass through T2 which is not bendy-able. Plus after service 969 was introduced, service 858 hardly have any standing passengers now.</div></blockquote>Yes a Pininfarina Habit bendy bus once went to Sembawang Park for a trial test in 2000. Successfully turned around the circus but it was decided not to use bendy bus due to low ridership. Shit, i should bring a camera.<br><br>I must say honestly. In Feb 2001, I saw Citaro Bendy and another Mercedes Benz 0405G entering T1 and T2 bus terminal for a trial run. Of course, it was successful! Asked one of Tibs staffs and he confirmed it was a test for Service 858. However, the result stated that the ridership was very low in the morning after Changi Airport. Hence, they introduced Service 969 and then all ITE Tampines students &amp; Temasek Poly students bidded farewell to horrible 858...<br><br>And there is 80% chance for Svc 804 to get bendy bus. It depends on whether the new route amendment is approved.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It's confirmed that Sembawang Town will get one feeder service. Service 167 and 980 will likely be moved back to a newly built interchange besides Sun Plaza. Service 962 and 859 should be studied into feasible implemention to see whether they can be mergered or not. Oh 169, 856 and 981 how??? It'll be interesting if Sembawang Town owns two bus terminals and one interchange. Hee hee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I find NR 2 route TOO LONG-WINDED! It's high time for Tibs to introduce service NR 9 from Marina Centre via Boat Quay, Chinatown, River Valley Rd, Orchard Rd, CTE, YCK Rd, Lentor Ave, Yishun Ave 2, Yishun Ring Rd (former route of 520), Yishun Ave 5, Sembawang Rd, Sembawang Ave, Sembawang Dr, Sembawang Way, Canberra Link, Sembawang Rd and loop at Sembawang Park.
