                  <p>Deeban, stop all these flamewars ok?? This time round you are in the wrong. Dun put the blame on others. I strongly agree with SMB128B and Gus.Chong. If you have not posted that comment last nite nothing would have happened.  Tell me, what have I done to offend you?? Once and for all please stop all this nonsense can or not?? And everytime you apologise, I close one eye, I accept. But after a few weeks you and your nonsense comes back again. Seriously when are you going to stop insulting me?? I have been tolerating you for the past 4 years. And if you have nothing constructive to post then dun post. This forum is for general discussions not to ruin everything. Don't ever force me down the throat to dig out all your past confessions and put up here for everyone to see how well your words cannot be trusted at all. Anything unhappy against me settle thru PM.</p>

              <p>Aiya... If now I see someone point a gun at someone else, u trying to say I should not come and help since it is not my business anyway huh? So u say I have to be friends with the gunner to know that he is an inhumane bastard to point a gun at someone? This is purely an example BTW. </p>
              <p>LOL. You are in the wrong and you are trying to flame others with useless arguments and false speculations. Please. I don't really wanna flame, but you have to control yourself. Stop being so sensitive. I am sorry for using those words, if an apology is what it takes to calm u down on the asshole point. So... truce? I will stop calling u offensive stuff and you will not go and shoot someone due to assumptions on his motives?</p>

              <p>I've noticed... Merc can shoot him all he want on the above, just like how he shot me in the past... But this time it's too much. As far as I have noticed, there isnt a single mention of any of the services you have mentioned, and I dont sense any hidden motives. Merc is the FIRST ONE to come and stand from the rest. Like seriously. Ok. Last time he moan 70, 163, 854 etc. He shot him. Fine. I nothing say, coz I also want them to get WAB, so I learnt my lesson. Now? I shot Merc back becoz I find it ridiculous to try to flare up something that doesn't need to be there at all. Redundant move. Makes everybody unhappy. This is why I was so flamed. I don't have to leh. Others are talking constructive opinions relative to the topic (all except that 388-ass), and suddenly, BOOM! Phantom strike. Well, this isn't pleasant leh. </p>

              <p>Agree. For SMRT case at most 100 more A24s, then enough of MAN already. I would like to see them trial the 3 door Mercedes-Benz Conecto or the 4 door Conecto G.</p>
              <p>As for SBS, well it is really time for a change, time to get B9Ls and Enviro 500s for a change.</p>

              <p>In the past, SBS had different buses different models from different depots. And different estates had different bus models.</p>
              <p>Those days in the 80s, AMDEP/JRBP had mainly Merc OF1413 and OF1417s, TPDEP had Leyland Victory, BBDEP/BNDEP/HGDEP had Volvo B57 and Albion Vikings. HGDEP had Merc OF1417s as well.

              <p>Come 90s, SBS bought many different new bus models and designs. BBDEP and HGDEP had Volvo MK2s, TPDEP and BNDEP had Scania N113CRBs and AMDEP/JRBP had 0405s. And eventually all the 0405s were mainly from TPDEP (now BRBP), AMDEP and JRBP (now SLBP) areas. While BBDEP/ARBP/HGDEP/BNDEP had mainly Volvo MK3s and Volvo MK4s.</p>
              <p>Ever since SBST roll in the new WAB buses starting 2006, it seems that the trend had changed.
