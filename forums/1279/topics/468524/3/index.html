              <p>In the past, SBS had different buses different models from
              different depots. And different estates had different bus
              models.</p>
              <p>Those days in the 80s, AMDEP/JRBP had mainly Merc OF1413 and
              OF1417s, TPDEP had Leyland Victory, BBDEP/BNDEP/HGDEP had Volvo B57
              and Albion Vikings. HGDEP had Merc OF1417s as well. For the DDs,
              BBDEP/BNDEP/AMDEP had Leyland Atleanteans, TPDEP/JRBP had LO2x,
              while HGDEP had mostly Merc 0305s.</p>
              <p>Come 90s, SBS bought many different new bus models and designs.
              BBDEP and HGDEP had Volvo MK2s, TPDEP and BNDEP had Scania N113CRBs
              and AMDEP/JRBP had 0405s. And eventually all the 0405s were mainly
              from TPDEP (now BRBP), AMDEP and JRBP (now SLBP) areas. While
              BBDEP/ARBP/HGDEP/BNDEP had mainly Volvo MK3s and Volvo MK4s.</p>
              <p>Ever since SBST roll in the new WAB buses starting 2006, it
              seems that the trend had changed. Everywhere u get to see Scania
              K230UBs, Volvo B9TL Wrights and Merc Citaros, which are now evenly
              distributed to every depots. It is not as if 1 depot restrict only
              to Scania K230UBs while the other with only Merc Citaros.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The reason why that is so because the K230UBs aren't restricted to be only replacing the O405s. Same goes to the Citaros. Not restricted to replacing Mk3s and Mk4s but also as fleet add.<br><br>But the trend I can see now is that HGDEP has a whole lot less KUBs as compared to AMDEP, as HGDEP had less [ or none ] O405s. Citaros also trend for the first batch. AMDEP had less than ARBP and HGDEP as ARBP and HGDEP had tons of Mk3s.</p>
