Have you forgotten 290 having 999, the MB0405G bendy bus as a perm fixture on 290? If I remember correctly, there were no problems with 290 and bendy buses. DDs on 38 may be a problem though...</div></blockquote>I agree that bendy buses may not be able to be deployed on Service 38. The Tampines-Bedok sector may be easier for bendies to move about. However the Bedok-Tampines sector, in particular the Simei Road and Simei St 4 junction, where the buses will make a left turn, is hazardous to bendies and even to normal 12m buses. Notice that the line markings along Simei St 4 was redrawn further back, to allow buses to make a safe turn.</div>

Took it several times, as well as watch it pass by, and 80% of the time it is almost empty. Then again, maybe tts because I dont usually see it during peak hours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>156 is another funny bus. Its frequency is actually rather high sometimes (when you dont really need the bus), but you will often see one bus jam packed while the others are relatively less loaded.<br><br>Not to mention that 53 is just as wierd! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

That was the reason the BC gave me and he told me that there was DD &amp; bendy training for 38 before it was introduced.</div>
