              <p>Freer than here for sure. In the case of GM... GM had just too many employees and was such a established and big part of the economy that the government simply couldn't afford to let them fail. In USA there are so many other car companies, so your statement cannot be used in context. Though GM is a strong lobby interest, they do not "control" others.</p>

              <p>Suddenly the Unions came into my mind as well for not being
              flexible, being e culprits of end up helping their union members to
              lose their jobs.</p>
              <p>The Western govt do have protectionalism laws on it's industries
              as well.</p>
              <p>Make it ironic, back in e 1970s, there were 3 bus cos yet they
              did not bother to find innovation like double decks or OMTS until
              all were forced merged into SBS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>There are many transport operators in Europe and USA for instance. Premium long distance buses is a good point in which elaboration is not necessary.

              <p>So you saying SG should have a duopoly on bus routes?! So this unhealthy competition that kills off prospective new entriants into the market should be continued?! Look at what LTA is doing... This is state-controlled monopoly. Look at how many percent in shares are the current two operators owned by the government and how "efficient" the network in SG is. Ask yourself this. Do you find it efficient to travel from a SBST controlled territory to a SMRT controlled territory? Have you thought why? If then so, how to solve?</p>

              <p>I'm not saying of duopoly or sort. End of the day it boils down to this question. 1) Would having more small players keep cost lower over purchase or it'll escalate over economies of scale? 2) Would new operators be interested into investing capital into bigger buses like double decks? 3) Would they be committed to providing bus svs bet 0530 - 0000 other than e profitable peak hr slot? 4) Are they willing to committ themselves into investing on things that'll improve passengers life i.e. IRIS or ez-link card as and when opportunity arises?</p>
              <p>If it's a No, then it's not worth to compete just for e sake of competing. The days before SBS is a golden example.</p>
              <p><br>e area issue I'll put it tis way, it's just like wat's going on in HK right now.. Kowloon rt and HK Island rts are exclusive to their own side</p>
              <p>As for state owning, dun tell me you can't buy SBS's share in SGX?</p>
