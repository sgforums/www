            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LTA invites feedback on names for MRT stations along Circle Line </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : The Land Transport Authority is inviting feedback on suitable names for MRT stations along the new Circle Line.<br><br>The first three stages of the Circle Line will have 12 stations. It will pass through Orchard Road, the civic district and some of the busiest corridors in the city and some residential towns.<br><br>Most of the stations have been given a working name.<br><br>The station next to the War Memorial Park, for example, has been called Convention Centre.<br><br>But now the LTA is asking the public whether they agree with these names.<br><br>"I kind of like Convention Centre because this area is all about convention halls. So it is to identify with the place."<br><br>"Personally I think it is Suntec Station because it is simple and it is Suntec City!"<br><br>"Certainly, if you put Memorial Park it would be a nice name."<br><br>"I think Esplanade is better, well-known especially among the tourists."<br><br>But the LTA has some rules about how these stations should be named. <span style="color: red;">There should not be any names of commercial buildings or private institutions.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">It is also not keen for stations to be named after roads as these could span long distances and may not give a good idea of the station's location.</span><br><br>The station next to the Singapore Art Museum is now called "Museum Station", but even a Turkish expatriate prefers calling it 'Bras Basah'.<br><br>"Bras Basah sounds better to me than Museum...it is too generic, too common," he said.<br><br>"I will prefer Bras Basah because it is a very old name, and everybody knows the place. And I can identify with the area rather than calling it Museum Station. Some of the older folks may not know 'Museum Station'."<br><br>The public have six weeks to give their feedback to LTA at cr_mailbox@lta.gov.sg - CNA<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Courtesy channelnewsasia.com</span></div>
