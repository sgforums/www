Time and money is wasted on 2 train rides which lines run paraell to one another.<br><br>Currently the best solution is to link the 2 stations via Citilink Mall. One of the reason why Convention Centre station is build on its own is due to the CCL route alignment. If the station is to build alongside City Hall station along Stamford Rd, then there will be problem for route alignment to Millenia station.</div>
