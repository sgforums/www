            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I'm thinking of writing a letter to SBS Transit HQ for us to visit Hougang Depot in December. Besides the in-house bus assembly plant, what other good things can I talk about? I'll do a draft by next Sunday.<br><br>For the day of visit, how about first week of December? Unlike Tibs when I can just send in an email, I have to write in a letter to SBS Transit. I tried sending an email to the stupid Dorothy Lee and the reply was "We had noted your interest in visiting our depot. We will organise a trip for Friends <strong>soon</strong> (how soon?)"<br><br>Of course now you are not sure whether you can can make it for the trip but if you are interested, please tell me. It's better for me to indicated the number of interested people.<br><br>All of you are invited, and feel free to give any comments.</div>

SBST staffs have to take off their time to entertain us otherwise the managers may not be happy with them. Not wise....<br><br>Suggest for SBST to host a one-day depots tour for us e.g visiting 3 depots by SBST chartered bus together with a few staffs.

            <div class='col-md body'>That sounds logical. We would ask SBST to send a Trident or even better, Scania N113CRB or Leyland Olympian 2-axle!</div>

Of course, it's true!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Darryl, we have to make the special negotiation on lowering the price for chartered bus if SBST is reluctant to sponsor us. More likely, we have to share money to book a single bus...cheaper lah. It's best if we all sign the petition to bombard SBST to host a one-day 3 depots tour for us. "Host" means SBST sponsors us a chartered Superbus...maybe VSO  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Name 3 depots which you will like to visit FIRST:<br>1)<br>2)<br>3)<br><br>If the FIRST visit is voted, then we know how much we want to visit!

            <div class='col-md body'>To "Smiley Volgren": may I know your user ID on the message board?<br><br>Back to the topic, I guess SBST won't be so kind. We have to charter the bus ourselves if we want transported to be provided. How I wish the 811Ds are still around..You see, the 27-seater bus is enough for all of us and imagine the group of us occupying about two-thirds of the seats! Probability -&gt;0. So how, what model shall we charter? B10BLE, Mk 4 (27xx, 28xx series) or Mk 4 (9xx series)? Maybe we can gather at say, Hougang Central Int and wait for the bus to pick us up? Oh yes, we should get more people going, so that the cost paid by each person will be reduced.<br><br>Do you think there is a canteen in each depot? We can't go on the tour w/o eating lunch rite?<br><br>About the petition...if you are interested in going (whether you can eventually make it is another case), pls sign your name, scan it and send it to me. I shall include the signatures of <strong>everyone</strong> who is interested.<br><br>My votes: 1. HGDEP 2. SLBP 3. AMDEP. Charles, you see i'm so~ good to you!</div>
