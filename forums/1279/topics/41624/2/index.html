How I wish the 811Ds are still around..You see, the 27-seater bus is enough for all of us and imagine the group of us occupying about two-thirds of the seats! Probability -&gt;0. So how, what model shall we charter? B10BLE, Mk 4 (27xx, 28xx series) or Mk 4 (9xx series)? Maybe we can gather at say, Hougang Central Int and wait for the bus to pick us up? Oh yes, we should get more people going, so that the cost paid by each person will be reduced.<br><br>Do you think there is a canteen in each depot? We can't go on the tour w/o eating lunch rite?<br><br>About the petition...if you are interested in going (whether you can eventually make it is another case), pls sign your name, scan it and send it to me.

Long distance is alright, then we can enjoy our ride on our chartered bus!<br><br>I don't think there's anything wrong with having lunch at a depot.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I got an email from someone called Sabrina from SBST Advertising Department regarding charter enquiry. She gave me a file regarding the price of chartering but most of the info can be found here.<br><br><a href="https://www.bus-charter.com.sg/MMS_PROD/SilverStream/Pages/pgCharterPricePublic.html&lt;br%20/&gt;" rel="nofollow">http://www.bus-charter.com.sg/MMS_PROD/SilverStream/Pages/pgCharterPricePublic.html<br></a><br><br>I realised that chartering a bus may not be feasible because be it multiple stopover (i.e. Point A to B to C and back to A) or at disposal, there's a time limit of 4 hours. How about I make special arrangements for special buses (eg Lynx, U31SCN, 16.240, etc) to be available for us to hop on a joy ride within the depot or maybe just outside the depot?<br><br>She was also kind enought to refer me to Ms Connie Chua from Corporate Comms to arrange for a visit. She gave me Ms Chua's email address, so may just send her an email. This will make things easy for all of us.[/b]</div>
