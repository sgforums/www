I totally agree, TIBS is showing us that it is cash greedy by putting 520 on a feeder route which not only wastes time but also cheats those passengers who do not know it is an express service.<br><br>Plus now with the NEL, I'm not surprised that TIBS is reviewing its operations on 520, considering that taking the NEL to Dhoby Ghaut and then MRT to Yishun would take almost the same time as 520 or maybe be even faster. The bendies on 520 during morning peak is definately a waste of resources. With service 39 coming up now, TIBS should transfer those bendies to 969 in order to compete with SBS.</div>

Now it is August. So it is true that 520 have no Bendys.<br><br>What you observed were Saturday treats - 1058 is permanently on 812 and 1019 is permanently on 854. They were merely cameos and do not belong to the 851/520 fleet. 1138 is permanently 851 so there is no suprise that once in a blue moon it appears on 520.<br><br>I take 520/851 almost every morning so I definitely know better.<br><br>If you dont believe me, I invite u for one weekday morning and one Saturday morning to sit with me at a 520 bus stop, sip coffee/tea with breakfast and talk about buses while spotting the whole 520 fleet. You will be appalled to find that they are mostly Dennis Lances with almost every seat filled by the time they leave Yishun.</div>

But as you said the downside is that it is ridiculously expensive plus the 20 minutes headway if you just missed one.<br><br>Now that 520 is going to be withdrawn, 851 should be having a less constantly changing fleet.</div>

If I'm not wrong, Scania N113s also appeared on service 16 and 16E.</div>

I'm not sure when Sv 390 was amended to loop at Tomlinson Road.<br><br>Svc 23 used to loop at Tomlinson Road too before it was amended later on to loop at Rochor Canal Road.</div>

I recall riding on them (Changi Airport - Tomlinson Road - back to Changi Airport for only 45cents) before validators were installed in them. (MB WAs had no floor riser where the validators were placed. Being young then, I remember my feet were hanging in the air)<br><br>Before that Volvo Mk IIs (both with Duple Metsec and Walter Alexander bodies) were deployed on Svc 390.<br><br>Earlier than that, I have no idea which buses were used on Svc 390.
