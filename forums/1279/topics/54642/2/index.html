            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, svc 23 used to travel all the way to Orchard Rd, but I'm not sure if it looped at Tomlinson Rd. However, it was later shorten to loop at Rochor Canal Rd, coz the MRT line was opened between Tampines and Orchard.<br><br>Yes, Mercedes Benz MB O405 (eg SBS484M) later joined forces with the existing Scania N113OACs to serve svc390 (but no sure abt Volvo MK II deployment on this svc).<br><br>Svc 16 also uses a number of Scania N113 CRB and OACs during the route from Bt Merah-Airport. but most of the fleets on this svc are dominated by the Volvo families..</div>

It's a misfortune as this proves that express services proved to be unviable for Tibs. But, ever since Express521 was amended and rebranded as sv963, things have been looking up for the service.
