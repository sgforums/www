Only TIB 725 A is repainted with new SMRT livery.. But now, either it gets 2 UD U31RCNs buses &amp; or 3 UD U31RCNs buses (with the exception of last Sunday, 16/1/05, see P.S below for more details).. If you are lucky, u might catch better buses with better looking like the Scania<br>SCANIA L113CRL Walter Alexander Strider, TIB 637 X, with Power 98 FM ad, or some other MB O405 CAC buses..<br><br>P.S: Last Sunday, 920 has full MB fleets for the whole day and 921 has Scania bus (TIB 638 T) also for the whole day.. From what i noticed, on that day, i only saw 1 UD U31RCN CAC bus passing thru Bt Panjang Road towards Boon Lay once (think is TIB 1253 M cos this bus is the only bus in this series with an ad at the back of the bus.. correct mi if i'm wrong).. Other than that, i never saw anymore UD U31RCN buses anymore for that whole day, not even the OAC version.. (still wondering y is this so..)</div>
