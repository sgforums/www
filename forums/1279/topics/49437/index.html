If you think that the 3 point reversing at Harbourfront is serious enough, this is worse. Basically, the bus driver missed the narrow entrance to the L-shaped thingy and had to reverse, and effectively dammed the road, and after some hair-raising struggle, he went into the L-shaped thing, but ended up stuck there. If I remember correctly, there is hedge or poles at the end to prevent overshooting. The thing is designed for a 12m 0405, not a 17+m 0405G. Thus, there is that trailer hanging out in the road and caused a bit of hold-up. I dun know how the driver did it before my trip, but I guessed he attempted an articulator-breaking turn. Anyway, I think the bus behind got the inspector with him to and helped to direct traffic and the Bendy driver while he reverse on the whole road. It took 10 minutes before the bus got going to the next bus stop. After that, 0405Gs are history on 804.<br><br>However, there are still Bendys deployed on 804 today, especially in the afternoon, using 806 Bendys. The route is similar to the old 804A, where the bus expressed from the interchanged to the Blk 356 bus stop to pick up its first passengers, and follows the normal 804 route after that.<br><br>Hope this answers your queries<br></div>
