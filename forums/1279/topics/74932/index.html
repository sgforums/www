            <div class='col-md body'>No, i don;t think its very possible to park at the coach park. This is especially in light of the rather tight chicanes that the bus has to go through right after exiting PTB1 basement. Moreover, the coach park can be in very high demand during peak times. Also, it would be hard to co-ordinate the services there as the main control is located in the basement. It is also more than adequate for two service 36 mk4/mk5 to park comfortably at its own berth at PTB 2,<br><br>I rather pity my svc 858 drivers,many are actually forced to drive 80+ fare stages non stop due to some delay in their timetables during peak hours.....they zip in and out of each terminal before rocketing its way of PTB 2 basement , negotiate the S bend and into ECP at 4th gear ( power!!! )</div>
