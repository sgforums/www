Only much later on did they retrofit a pneumatic operated door but no stick was used instead the valve tap was like the swing type, like that used in laboratory gas supply taps.<br><br>I think the stick type here were original fittings &amp; only used by the Japanese buses like Hino &amp; Nissan Diesel. Never saw it on any O 309 here.<br><br>The O 306 however came with original auto doors with quite different operating switches. It was the 'silent' type (but i don't think it's hydraulic though possible) with hardly any air sound when the doors open/close unlike the other types which were noisy when operating. To open a door the driver had to press down a button located near the parking brake &amp; to close the same button had to be pulled upwards. 1 button for each door.<br></div></blockquote>Ooh, I remember those door levers. The swing type of lever was the standard on almost all of the SBS buses. The old ones on the Soon Chow buses really look like a gas supply tap. But the ones on the OF1417 and B57 is a slim metallic rod with a black/red blob at the end. The switch type on the Nissan and Hino was short. On most buses, extensions were fitted in the form of metal rods or rubber hoses. Extensions were fitted on the Atlantean too, whose lever was originally located near the knee level onthe left. These were later replaced with the push/pull type located under the window on the right; ditto for the B57 and 1417.<br><br>As regards to the O306, I remember those push/pull buttons. Sometimes they were tied to a string. The driver would just tug on the string to close the door. I don't recall encountering a silent one. Once the driver push/pull the button, it will give a short and sharp "PISH" then "BANG" went the door. It gave me the shocks but I love that old bus because of the high seats.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe those Volvo used the swing lever type mounted on the right to the driver since there were no driver's door.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't find the metal levers protruding vertically towards the standing passengers/driver safe to even think about !

I definitely mark those Japanese designs DOWN &amp; out for such poor passive safety considerations !

These switches were also used to replace the original swing lever on the older Atlanteans and also on the OF1417. If I remember correctly, it was pull to open and push to close.</div>

Those long metal rods were actually the lever plus the extension, added for easier access. They were located on the left, level with the dashboard. The location of the levers, although obstructed somewhat by the steering wheel, can be seen below.<br><br><a href="http://suhirman.fotopic.net/p10788509.html" rel="nofollow">http://suhirman.fotopic.net/p10788509.html</a><br><br>I don't think passengers will tumble there as the drivers cab is cordoned by a metal tube. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> As for quiet doors, it would be on the Atlanteans.
