              <p>The answer is you simply have to observe.</p>
              <p>376Z's would have come back by now IF it was under
              refurbishment, The replacements has already been made, But won't
              rule them coming back. If 370P is under refurbishment, it will be
              random cameos, Not 667J covering it, Likewise for 368Y, it won't be
              taken by 664S. I believe if SMRT wants to keep those UDs
              364H-377X won't get laid in the first place. The answer I believe
              is obvious enough, OCs arent to be used as an excuse.</p>

              <p>yes.. but you alway did not observe the correct things..</p>
              <p>TIB376Z is laid up last year and it is gone forever. There is reasons why they laid up a lot of UD last year.. They have to find space to take in the new OCs. and these UDs that laid up/deregistered are of worst condition or having issues in maintenance.. That why only selected few.. 362/363/365/368/370/375/1255 are not laid up and still serving till this year..</p>
              <p>Do not go and alway mess up the deployment of Sv178. You keep saying that certain buses replace 370 on its slot and certain bus replace 368 on its slot. but you cant even tell us what is the shift of each bus on Sv178. I.e what shift is the original 368 on, what shift is the original 370 on and what are the timing? SInce you are so familiar with Sv178 fleet and duty codes, you should be able to give the shift details and the respective bus on each shift/slot? You alway say that this bus replace this .. but yet i did  not see any concrete proof from you telling us the exact shift details. I have asked you once. but you did not reply.</p>

              <p>OCs cant really be used as an excuse, If they have interest in keeping the UDs they would have done so by now, the CSS1XX regos would have gone, not 364H,366C-377X. 362M and 363K are solely used for TRG purposes I believe.</p>
              <p>368Y's slot is 178 AM07/PM07. 664S is perming that slot.</p>
              <p>370P is AM03/PM03. Now covered by 667J. (Note this slot serves as the last bus at Boon Lay)</p>

              <p><br>Someone has just yet to realise that its the company's decision and that no matter how it is being debated, it doesn't make any changes to the current state of issues. We can't do anything about what they had decided that what's better for the company. If they do things like this just live with it, no point harping over the issue about why they should be kept and what not. There is nothing we can do about the issue either ... ... no need to stress over a few UDs also</p>
