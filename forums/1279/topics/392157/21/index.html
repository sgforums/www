              <p><br>I think SMRT had to really start utillising overnight parking at some more interchanges like CCK and WDL. I see that all 3 depots couldn't cope the number of buses at the moment. I agree it's a hazard but the public should be understanding about the matter, which i doubt so. Give SMRT sometime to manage the fleet with a round of redeployments. I know there are plans for a KCDEP in the coming years and i hope it will help ease the choking of buses into the depots.</p>

              <p>i think SMRT did get the approval from the authorities to park their buses along the roadside... Frankly speaking, i also work at that area... i dun think these buses are causing hazard to any one. The traffic is very light at night... and there are very very few people walking on the road at night, except for some foreign workers who went to the shop/coffee shop at night..</p>
              <p>I dun think LTA/TP bother to go check that area also. I have alrd feedback to them a lot of time about illegal parking by car/lorry at the junction of Kranji Loop/Kranji road, near the coffeeshop areas during day time and they dun even come and give summon to these vehicles. If you have taken 925 during peak hours, you can notice of those illegal parked vehicles at the road side..</p>

              <p>i think SMRT did get the approval from the authorities to park
              their buses along the roadside... Frankly speaking, i also work at
              that area... i dun think these buses are causing hazard to any one.
              The traffic is very light at night... and there are very very few
              people walking on the road at night, except for some foreign
              workers who went to the shop/coffee shop at night..</p>
              <p>I dun think LTA/TP bother to go check that area also. I have
              alrd feedback to them a lot of time about illegal parking by
              car/lorry at the junction of Kranji Loop/Kranji road, near the
              coffeeshop areas during day time and they dun even come and give
              summon to these vehicles. If you have taken 925 during peak hours,
              you can notice of those illegal parked vehicles at the road
              side..</p>

              <p><br> I think SMRT had to really start utillising overnight parking at
                  some more interchanges like CCK and WDL. I see that all 3 depots
                  couldn't cope the number of buses at the moment. I agree it's a
                  hazard but the public should be understanding about the matter,
                  which i doubt so. Give SMRT sometime to manage the fleet with a
                  round of redeployments. I know there are plans for a KCDEP in the
                  coming years and i hope it will help ease the choking of buses into
                  the depots.</p>

              <p>for WL's case, if they are going to start overnight parking, Where are they going to start?</p>

              <p>Even if WL has that in their own interchange, What about others? Batok already taken by KJ, while Yishun under AM, so there is literally no more space for WL to do overnight parking.</p>
