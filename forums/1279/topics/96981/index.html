Those white plates belong to "Scheme-B" services. There are a handful of services which still operates. However, I'm confused with the following sentence, <strong>"operators can remove those white plates and give smrt bus stop plates their white plates, not use white here and gray there"</strong>. You mean SMRTB should adopt the white colour plates instead? Or?<br><br><blockquote><strong>also, the smrt bus stop plates feels a little bit empty as compared to sbst ones. e.g. sbst ones will state the bus stop description (e.g. little india station) but smrt dun have. in the past the "TRANS-ISLAND" logo was long, so can understand, but now the SMRT logo is shorter, having those empty spaces on the right of the plate looks awkward.</strong></blockquote>IMO, SMRTB should display the bus-stop description in their territories (eg Woodlands, Yishun, Bt Batok), especially those bus-stops without any SBST service calling. Since SBST plates already have the bus-stop description, it is redundant for SMRTB to do the same. The Transitlink Bus Guide still provide the same description for both SBST and SMRTB.</div>

I agree that the 2 plates look very much alike in low lighting conditions. However, they do put the destination name under the service, but its a pity they dun put much brains into doing it. For example, there are pairs of bus stop in Yishun that say Yishun in both directions for NR1, so are the commuters left in a daze and return to Yishun in 10mins or 1hr 40 mins later? These bus stops are the older ones and hence do not have provision for the new bus stop info posters yet.</div>
