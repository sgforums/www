              FROM THE DESK OF BUSES[in]GAPORE! TOP AND ONLY OFFICIAL PAGE ON SINGAPORE BUSES
              <p>
              Photography of buses (or for the matter, anything as the subject) - never start to box yourself in to rules, it's your freedom to photograph the way you want it, and to create the stories you want to tell.
              </p><p>
              But I never believed in photographing following one standard angle + sunlight at all. Sunlight on the subject - "a requirement" in some sgforums (which was the main bus forum before it collapsed)? Why the hell is some enthusiasts setting up rules like the one in the screenshot back then?
              </p><p>
              90% body, 10% head for the angle, cannot be pok (intruded) by shadow, cannot be pok by car, cannot half bright half dark.It's understandable, people don't want to look back regret pictures side dark and "sian-ed", EDS display must be perfect full etc. Head cannot be "big" (too much front, bus cannot blur if not is "fail". And get restrict the flexibility and locations of just photographing buses... Sure, it's advisable and encouraged, that's totally fine..
              </p><p>
              But what disgusts the most is the last paragraph of the third post.
              </p><p>
              People don't appreciate their efforts on trying to help them and they continue to snap "not too good" photos, throw them aside? And those "hopeless", bin them? This kind of attitude is seriously stupid. This was why i got boycotted because I felt those "rules" were too restrictive and I had attempted to voice out to photograph more freely as is. And then, the attempts to continually badmouth this page and me...
              </p><p>
              To you, might be pieces of rubbish low quality shots. To the others, some of them tells a story to many others who may appreciate it even though it's dark at the side, or is not of some "high standard". 
              </p><p>
              High standards...I've seen many overseas bus pages with photos that technically would be having a lower "standard", some taken with low megapixel cameras or sunlight at the "wrong direction", but those photos are able to tell the stories to the many others who visit the page! Some of their photos had a bit of blur but is still useable and they just upload it to tell and share the stories to others!
              </p><p>
              What really matters is that one one is able to freely enjoy or relax in a hobby, there was never a requirement in any hobby afaik, or some made up "rules" by some childish kids trying to dominate the hobby. Being able to tell the stories from your memories and your good or bad photos regardless of any camera models be it handphone, compact or DSLRs...i believe that's what matters. 
              </p><p>
              There are times when there might be this only one chance to snap and even though blur a bit or side a bit dark or "fail shot" but you might have caught a piece of history! There are past photos when cameras weren't even common, there were dark photos of pre-1980s buses which you can't tell too much details or get covered by shadow, but they contained the important clues of the snapshot of the bus at that time!
              </p><p>
              Sometimes I do play about a bit with panning, rules of thirds, but most of the time i photograph things as is regardless of weather condition or stuffs...just try my best.
              </p><p>
              And for those who want to bother CSI-ing, ngjy22 (I heard) was the one who initiated that group boycott against me back then in 2009 which was mentioned in the 1st May post.. Look at this page today. Fail shots, low quality shots, so what? I bent the rules to be more flexible to photograph more freely, short and simple. I tell my own stories the way I want it to be.
