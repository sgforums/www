Street 21 and the area around it will be served by the new Kovan MRT station instead.<br><br>But businesses said the North-East Line station, which opened in June, had not brought in as many shoppers as expected. They have been lobbying to keep the interchange open.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA), however, has said that Hougang town is not big enough for two bus interchanges so close together. They are one MRT station apart.<br><br>MP for Aljunied GRC Cynthia Phua, who helped lobby to keep the interchange, said yesterday that the idea to convert part of the interchange to more than 100 carpark lots came up after an ongoing survey of shoppers revealed a large number came by car from private estates nearby.<br><br>There was a shortage of carparks in the vicinity, and the Housing Board has agreed to one being built, she said.<br><br>Madam Phua said she was also working with the LTA and bus and train operator SBS Transit to keep some bus services going along Hougang Street 21 after the interchange is closed.<br><br>She was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an unveiling ceremony to upgrade Hougang Central, one stop from Kovan.<br><br>Located at Hougang MRT station, Hougang Central will be spruced up over the next two years to attract train commuters to stop and shop there. The $2 million project, which will start in December, includes the construction of covered linkways and a gallery for outdoor events.<br><br>The area around Hougang South Interchange will also have similar works done, from March next year till 2005. The project will cost between $1.5 million and $2 million.<br><br>But retailers told The Straits Times that neither keeping a few bus routes nor building a carpark could make up for the loss of customer traffic.<br><br>Madam Cindy Sim, 50, who runs Golden Star Optical in Block 203, beside the interchange, lamented: 'The interchange area is where all the shops are. Closing it will cause my business to drop by at least 70 per cent.'<br><br>Another shopkeeper, Mr Billy Ho, 34, who runs B H Household Products in the same block, felt that a carpark would not serve most shoppers: 'What about those housewives who don't drive? They have to take the bus here, so having a carpark here will be of no use.'</div>
