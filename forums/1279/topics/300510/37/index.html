              <p><br> This is sort of expected.as my father told me,older buses bodies

                  strider accident is a classic example of how older buses bodies are
                  always strong and it also shows that older buses bodies dont give
                  way that easily no matter how much force or impact is put against
                  them.thumbs up to SBS2597H.i salute it.</p>

              <p>Survivablilty of vehicles and its occupants in accidents often calculates in the impact forces, angles and so on, but on more layman terms, older bodywork contain more or often full steel platings. This applies to trains as well, that is why the case than new vehicles often have lighter weights than their older counterparts.</p>
              <p>Many old buses and trains have steel platings. Often these are on the sides of the vehicle, used to protect occupants in the event of a crash. Roof can be of aluminium platings. Of an entire vehicle, the strongest part would have to be its chassis. It is one part of the vehicle that cannot break first. That is why when welding a chassis back together, extreme care has to be taken and often the case of a vehicle breaking its chassis would mean scrapping, due to the cost and danger involved in modifying/repairing the chassis.</p>
              <p>Now, bodyworks of buses and trains tend to go towards the lightweight side, as had been for the past ten years in fact. Weights dropped, crash protection fluctuates around the safety levels, but would not be able to attain those of the pre-90s level, where a bus/train is built like a tank. Taking a modern bodywork, many of the parts are of easily replaceable and machined, like plastic, aluminium and composite material. Steel still exists, in vital areas like the driver's cabin (leg area) and often the frame of the bodywork.</p>
              <p>Old cars with dents, all you need is a mallet and knock the dent out! Now, the whole piece of cover, bumper or door needs to be replaced in a similar accident. One knock of the mallet can make the material go broken easily.</p>
