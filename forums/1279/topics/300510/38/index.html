              <p>most likely e mechanics gave new suspensions for that bus. after some time, e springs shld go back to their original positions. i've seen such situations bef, except that mostly it was e front that went up.</p>

              <p>Its not whether bus manufacturers have or not, but whether bus companies want or not. Bus manufacturers can just simply outsource their doors (which they seem to always do) to others to manufacture.</p>
