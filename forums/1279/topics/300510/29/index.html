              <p>There was actually one incident, but it was SBS9296E (BN 9) which broke down (I think) along Loyang Ave just after TPE towards Changi Village. Front desto taken down, BC nowhere to be seen. I saw it around 7.50am today.<br><br>However there was no visible damage, and no vehicles around. Same incident? Or two different incidents on the same stretch of road?</p>

              <p>Water is to cool down the bus engine component (not very sure what it cools). Likely the bus ran out of water and BC risked overheating the engine.</p>
              <p>Just one thing, how the BC get so much water to pour into the engine? thought BC carry 1 bottle for personal consumption</p>

              <p>There's a tap just further up the road I suppose, or maybe he borrowed one of the house's taps. He had three bottles (maybe also borrowed from the residents of the houses along the road). and just kept walking to and fro the tap and the back of the bus.</p>

              <p>SMRT bendy bus hit car</p>
              <p>From mycarforum:</p>
              <p><span>The incident:   <br> <em><br>I
              was on clementi road(Commonweath Ave West) queueing up to turn in to
              Clementi ave 2. There were 2 lanes turning into the road, i took the
              outer lane. There was an accident at the opposite junction and traffic
              was slow, beside me was a SMRT bus(those extended long one). <br><br>As
              i was approaching the turn, i saw the SMRT bus beside me sped up front
              and make left signal. i immediately put my car to stop knowing that he
              needed more space to turn into the road and it happened that the rear
              bumper of the SMRT bus hit/brush my car body just above the front
              wheel. i only managed to see the left bumper which has scratches and
              paint from my car, didn't see the car plate after making the turn. <br><br>I
              stop by the road side to check my car, damage was dents and scratches.
              i didn't manage to follow the bus as it make a right turn after that.
              It was bus 184. Not knowing that bus 184 actually was a looping bus
              from bukit panjang, i went clementi interchange to check. When i reach
              Bukit Panjang interchange the person in charge told me that all the
              buses have returned to the depot at Kranji. <br><br>When i reached
              Kranji, i asked for all the BUS 184 plate numbers from the counter. i
              manage to track which is the bus that has hit me as there was scratches
              on the bumper. <br><br>They ask me to talk to the driver tomorrow
              and see how and also talk to thier claim dept tomorrow as they already
              went back. No report file on thier side and no police report made. <br><br>what should i do next? </em> </span></p>

              <p>Does anyone know which 184 bendy bus has scratches on the bumper?</p>
