              <p><br>Not really agree with what the BC does. Firstly, BC speeds, not only is he putting his life at risk, it includes that of passengers... should innocent passengers be dragged into accidents just because BC wants to be on time?</p>
              <p>Secondly, no matter how late he is, BC still must pick up passengers. Unless he contacts OCC and OCC allows him to go into Alighting only mode.</p>
              <p>Well... maybe he is just one of the black sheep in SMRT community...</p>

              <p>I would say that this may be another case of bus captains not monitoring the water levels or not checking their buses properly all together... It may also be a design problem with certain batches, but not to forget that actually all bendies do suffer from problems such as 'thirsty' (consuming water tanks everyday to cool the engine) or fuel line leak (happened to 1224Y twice last year), in which the second one would demand a immediate return to the depot. I would say that it was observance that saved the buses that had the problem.</p>

              <p>@tamago: Yeah, 1224Y got hit 110 degrees for the dial with the cog (same as SGF's) and that I guess is for the gearbox. Water temperature can hit 90 degrees, but once it reaches 100 the bus will no longer move. But the occurance of fire seems to be isolated to ZF Bendies so far. I would consider the bus captain (name not release for privacy) of service 189 who is perm 1224Y professional and responsible as he does a walk around check everytime after he tapped his card at the office. For example, arrive into Interchange, off load passengers, drive to parking, get off and tap card, <strong>come back and walk round the bus once</strong>, especially stopping at the engine compartment area. Once I saw him opening the cover and closing again. This is what responsibility is I believe.</p>
              <p>@Oceane: Yeah the reports must be quite mixed up. We cannot be sure of the service but that parking slot can be used by all SMRT services.</p>
              <p>New Paper: "A bus at Boon Lay Interchange caught fire yesterday morning. Its driver was apparently unaware till a fellow driver had horned, reported Shin Min Daily News. A stall owner at the interchange said the bus had dropped off its passengers and was heading to the parking bay. A series of explosions followed, before fire spouted from the rear engine. The fire was later put out by Civil Defence officers. No one was hurt."</p>

              <div><br>Said the STOMPer: "Yesterday at Boon Lay bus interchange, a bendy bus was seen to have caught fire at the engine at the back of the bus.</div>

              <p>Can't say that actually. There are so many buses with ZF gearboxes, but why must Habits catch fire? And. Theres also the MK2 and 2nd Batch Habits that have yet to catch fire.</p>

              <p>Here we have to go in to the fact that there are some batch 1 ZF Habits which does not have intercoolers like some suggested. I have not seen the engine personally so there is no proof whether which has intercooler or not.</p>
              <p>But even with intercooler it does not mean the engine would not catch fire also, and once again, the CRBs are to proof also...</p>
