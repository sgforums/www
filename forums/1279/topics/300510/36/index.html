              <p>SBS2597H was involved in an accident while on its perm service 196 at Esplanade Bridge. It was heading towards Bedok Int when it happened. Apparently, it stopped at the bus stop and a lorry whacked straight into its back. Two SBST recovery vehicles seen around the area, pax all got off. Damage looks serious, might be out of service for some time. Was on SBS3797R on 57 when I witnessed this accident, time of witness about 6pm. No indication of any injuries.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I also saw the accident, was about the same time on service 196, SBS7382C, heading Bedok. Damage to lorry was much limited to the cab, the rear panel of the bus was at most dented, the glass in fact held and the rear service plate was still in place.</p>
              <p>The broken glass on the ground possibly came from the lorry's front windscreen. The Alexander bodywork held the impact quite well.</p>

              <p>But there are serious depot accidents which are uncommon. EG: Driving a MK IV DM3500 into a pit dug into the ground during renovations in BNDEP (During IMF). :lol: That MK IV DM3500 belonged to sv 36...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S: Does that account for the regular cameo of SBS1706S on 36 during the IMF? LOLx.</p>

              <p>SBS2597H was involved in an accident while on its perm service
              196 at Esplanade Bridge. It was heading towards Bedok Int when it
              happened. Apparently, it stopped at the bus stop and a lorry
              whacked straight into its back. Two SBST recovery vehicles seen
              around the area, pax all got off. Damage looks serious, might be
              out of service for some time. Was on SBS3797R on 57 when I
              witnessed this accident, time of witness about 6pm. No indication
              of any injuries.</p>

              <p>SBS2597H is back in service today on 8. Streaks of paint at the back of the bus are coming out, but bus looked okay.</p>

              <p>SBS9531B (on s69) had a tyre explosion slightly after 5 this evening, one stop after Bedok Interchange towards Tampines. Rear non-drive axle right tyre exploded, collapsing inside the rims. The bus captain was looking at the damage. No other vehicles involved and no visible damage to the bus.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I also saw the accident, was about the same time on service 196, SBS7382C, heading Bedok. Damage to lorry was much limited to the cab, the rear panel of the bus was at most dented, the glass in fact held and the rear service plate was still in place.</p>
              <p>The broken glass on the ground possibly came from the lorry's front windscreen. The Alexander bodywork held the impact quite well.</p>

              <p><br>This is sort of expected.as my father told me,older buses bodies are stronger.and he also told me that they are more solid also.this strider accident is a classic example of how older buses bodies are always strong and it also shows that older buses bodies dont give way that easily no matter how much force or impact is put against them.thumbs up to SBS2597H.i salute it.</p>
