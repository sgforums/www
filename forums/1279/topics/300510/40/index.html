              <p>Hard to gauge directly cause 8074 case its on a much more open road and possibly higher speeds. Being on the safe side, this case might involve about 20 - 30 km/h impact speed. Taking a bendy's emergency deceleration the alert point to impact point might be quite short. It is common to see buses trying to turn to the middle lane to avoid the cars dropping off passengers in the morning or buses waiting to off-load their passengers.</p>
              <p>And the accident happened this morning (03rd Dec), so night have not come yet when this post is created (or when the post of the accident was made).</p>

              <p>Seems that the damage to 1172M is more concerned as the EDS is damaged, possibly beyond economical repair. The dent is so much that it can be seen from the inside of the bus, although I must say that the Habit bodywork was excellent in preventing further injury to occupants.</p>

              <p>from e looks of it, 1172M can be fixed, as in they install new orange-coloured EDS like some other bendies use. however, e extent of e dents could show that it may take quite sometime for it before it returns to svc.</p>

              <p>I see this accident, reminds me of a few things:</p>
              <p>1: Cars like to stop there to pick up/drop off passengers. I have been on many buses, most of which almost get into accidents. Almost smashed into the windscreen when the svc 52 braked really hard. I was trying to get to a seat.</p>
              <p>2.  SMRT buses here are either driven by chiongsters or are very packed, leading to near-accidents or in this case, accidents.</p>
