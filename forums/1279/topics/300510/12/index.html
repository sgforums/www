              <p>SINGAPORE: A collision at Admiralty Road between an SMRT bus and a private bus left 15 people injured on Sunday evening.</p>
              <p>According to a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) spokesperson,
              the casualties suffered injuries ranging from head wounds to fractures
              to the arms, ankles and collarbones.</p>
              <p>The SCDF received a call
              about the accident at 8.36pm and several ambulances arrived on the
              scene. Except for one casualty who was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital,
              the rest — including the driver of the SMRT bus — were conveyed to the
              National University Hospital. The driver of the private bus was unhurt.</p>
              <p>It was not known at press time how many passengers the two buses were carrying respectively.</p>
              <p>According to eyewitnesses, the private bus was carrying more passengers and the SMRT driver was trapped in his vehicle.</p>
              <p>Taxi driver Shen Tian Hua told TODAY that the front of the SMRT bus was "badly mangled".</p>
              <p>Said Mr Shen: "Shards of glass were all over the road and the two buses were blocking two of the three lanes. It was messy." — TODAY/so</p>

              <h1>Fifteen injured as buses collide</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A collision at Admiralty Road between an SMRT bus and
              a private bus left 15 people injured on Sunday evening.</p>
              <p>According to a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)
              spokesperson, the casualties suffered injuries ranging from head
              wounds to fractures to the arms, ankles and collarbones.</p>
              <p>The SCDF received a call about the accident at 8.36pm and
              several ambulances arrived on the scene. Except for one casualty
              who was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the rest — including the
              driver of the SMRT bus — were conveyed to the National University
              Hospital. The driver of the private bus was unhurt.</p>
              <p>It was not known at press time how many passengers the two buses
              were carrying respectively.</p>
              <p>According to eyewitnesses, the private bus was carrying more
              passengers and the SMRT driver was trapped in his vehicle.</p>
              <p>Taxi driver Shen Tian Hua told TODAY that the front of the SMRT
              bus was "badly mangled".</p>
              <p>Said Mr Shen: "Shards of glass were all over the road and the
              two buses were blocking two of the three lanes. It was messy." —
