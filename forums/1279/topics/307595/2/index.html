              <p>For those people who conplain a lot regarding NAC buses on service 151, it is a good thing that service 151 will definitely become a FAC service by April 2008 after the last batch of Volvo MK2s are deregistered. Service 151 currently have only 2 NAC buses left out of total 25/28 buses (SBS1880X and SBS1893J)</p>
              <p>However, I think that this will not solve the overcrowding problem. I also believe that DD buses are impossible on service 151 due to the routes along NUS. In fact SBST should consider deploying more buses on service 151 during peak hours (perhaps crossover buses from other services). Maybe Scania K230UBs may help as it has more standing spaces <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>But I dun understand why they cant send DDs to stop OUTSIDE of the campus. Think out of the box?? If the single decks cant handle the load then use DDs and plan it in such a way that they can transfer passengers to the final destination (NUS in this case, but there's other schools like SIM/NP/all the bukit timah sec schs etc)?</p>
              <p>Since it's just that (stupid) bridge in NUS which causes the problem, why not just destroy that bridge (muhahaha)</p>

              <p><br>actually i was thinking to introduce 74M or 74B , that run along the same route with Sv 74 , but it will go straight along Clementi Road and travel to Kent Ridge terminal. Maybe it can run at 15 mins frequency from 7am to 12 noon and use DD . Can use those VO2x loh since the students are asking for DD, but never mention AC or NAC. haha.</p>
              <p>It will help to ease the load on Sv 151 and those students can choose to either transfer to Sv 96 along clementi road or alight at Kent Ridge terminal and take the internal shuttle near the Arts carpark (is there still shuttle service there?). I been almost 9 years never went back liao.<br>In the first place, SBST should not introduce Sv 151, then there will not be any complain. Everyone will take Sv 96. Even if increase the frequency of Sv 151 to 2 mins, it wont help also, cos of the traffic jam and you will still see buses bunching. Further, there is less demand out of NUS in morning, so what is SBST going to do with these extra buses, if they increase the frequency? All off service to Hougang/Bukit Timah to start new trips?</p>

              <p><br>ya the pair of bus stops is still there outside AS2, good for students transferring from Kent Ridge Terminal. It has A, B, D and BTC1 - basically access to every part of campus.</p>

              <p>yea. Throw the initiative back to NUS.</p>
              <p>NUS raise school fees mah....haahaha. Personally I think it's a better idea. lol.</p>
              <p>But I dun understand why they cant send DDs to stop OUTSIDE of the campus. Think out of the box?? If the single decks cant handle the load then use DDs and plan it in such a way that they can transfer passengers to the final destination (NUS in this case, but there's other schools like SIM/NP/all the bukit timah sec schs etc)?</p>
              <p>Since it's just that (stupid) bridge in NUS which causes the problem, why not just destroy that bridge (muhahaha)</p>

              <p><br>actually i was thinking to introduce 74M or 74B , that run along the same route with Sv 74 , but it will go straight along Clementi Road and travel to Kent Ridge terminal.

Even if increase the frequency of Sv 151 to 2 mins, it wont help also, cos of the traffic jam and you will still see buses bunching. Further, there is less demand out of NUS in morning, so what is SBST going to do with these extra buses, if they increase the frequency? All off service to Hougang/Bukit Timah to start new trips?</p>

              <p>Whether the bus roll back or not depends on BC driving style. That's why most 179 BCs will step on the accelerator for a 1-2 seconds before releasing the handbrake when climbing the NTU hill. The Standby/inexperienced ones dunno, they release handbrake first, then suddenly bus roll back.</p>

              <p><br>i know, but SBST275 is asking to introduce a limited stop service (151C) from toa payoh to NUS. Not me. There is FFW151E, but students are not taking, cos they cant use concession pass. So i dun think SBST will introduce another limited stop service from TPY to NUS. If they introduce, then those NTU/SP/NP/SIM or whichever school ppl, will ask SBST to introduce one service from each housing estate?</p>

              <p>As for Macpherson, you started by saying at 1st place 151 should not be introduced. By withdrawing it, many ppl along many stretches or travel pattern would be affected which incl Macpherson. If you said no comments, then in the 1st place that comment should not be there</p>
              <p>Actually it's the schedule does not reflect the true situation (My prev post, 1 bus supposed to arrive KR at 0923, yet at 0907 it's still at Aft Sixth Ave bus stop) rather than crowded area I suppose.</p>
