              <p><br>i know, but SBST275 is asking to introduce a limited stop service (151C) from toa payoh to NUS. Not me. There is FFW151E, but students are not taking, cos they cant use concession pass. So i dun think SBST will introduce another limited stop service from TPY to NUS. If they introduce, then those NTU/SP/NP/SIM or whichever school ppl, will ask SBST to introduce one service from each housing estate?</p>

              <p>then what do u wan SBST to do actually? do u think introduce 151C will solve the problem? does SBST have to give 3 mins frequency for Sv 151 from 6am to 10 pm so as to satisfy you? but in that case, buses will bunch, and then u will complain, just like what u have complain abt bunching in Sv 74.</p>

              <p>As for Macpherson, you started by saying at 1st place 151 should not be introduced. By withdrawing it, many ppl along many stretches or travel pattern would be affected which incl Macpherson. If you said no comments, then in the 1st place that comment should not be there</p>
              <p>Actually it's the schedule does not reflect the true situation (My prev post, 1 bus supposed to arrive KR at 0923, yet at 0907 it's still at Aft Sixth Ave bus stop) rather than crowded area I suppose.</p>

              <p>sv74 frequency erratic? it is due to the frequency and also traffic condition at marymount/lornie rd/bukit timah rd. </p>
              <p>as for Sv151, i did not say anything abt the withdrawal NOW. I was talking abt in 1994/95. If SBS does not Introduce Sv 151 THEN (in 1994/95) to NUS, then no complains will be heard..  All students just have to find their way to Clementi to take SV 96. Before that (94/95), there is also no bus from Macpherson to Hougang mah. So why are you talking abt the inconvenience to passengers at different sectors?</p>
              <p>so ultimately, you still think that SV 151C will solve the problem right? i dun think so.</p>

              <p>Tat's then, alrdy the service is in place, it's to look how to resolve instead of regretting wa last time why have 151, back then freq was somemore 3 - 10 mins for AM or 4 - 8 mins for PM... now is 7 - 13 mins (AM) 6 - 15 min (PM)</p>
              <p>Like I've said, how they schedule it matters. You can use excuses of jam each time, but no one is going to believe it once it becomes a daily affair</p>
              <p>Sv 151C would enter Toa Payoh New Town or even terminate at Bishan and runs limited stop along Bt Timah. It ends up resolve the crowding problem at Opp Trellis Twr in the morning. In fact, once a rude Sv 5 BC was horning on a Sv 151 bus which passengers were alrdy have difficulty in boarding</p>

              <p>Today took a joyride on service 151 (SBS8109U), and it seems that all the Volvo MK2s (regardless of all types) have disappeared on service 151 completely when I looked on the other side of the road thruout my journey. Make up of 5-6 Scania K230UBs and majority MK4 Striders. I wonder whether all the NAC/CAC MK2s were being replaced by the Scania K230UBs??</p>
              <p>I believe that service 151 should have more than 1 Scania K230UB permers (apart from SBS8120K). Maybe someone can help to update sgwiki if got any latest information about the fleet, thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Btw service 151 last time had <strong>18</strong>09, now have <strong>81</strong>09 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
