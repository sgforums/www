            <div class='col-md body'>Yea i heard about that bus, along with the Only Renault bus in SBS(then) fleet. What i meant is "new" MAN bus on our roads, such as the MAN 18.260/310 series.Oh yes! i found out something. Some of MAN engines, the D28 series(some of it) could be derived from Mercedes Benz engine, the OM447hLA or the OM457hLA. Both the MAN and Mercedes engine have the same capacity, 11967cc. This could mean that if SMRT bought the bus models with the D28 series engines, they might be able to use Mercedes engine parts on MAN engines, saving cost on  MAN parts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem could be reliability. I heard from a Malaysian friend that the MAN buses couldn't cope in our hot tropical climate. Scania and Mercedes buses fare a lot better. Other problems could be the price, the availabilty of parts and the ease of maintenance, which may not be as good as the other marques. But I like MAN buses because they have the guts. It's like a Scania but a lot more noisier. If our operators are planning to buy MAN, make it the Lion's City. This bus is way cool and its name kinda relfects our country too.</div>

Ya i also thought about reliability was the main prob, as well as parts. YEA! I love the sound of MAN buses! Especially the Causeway link's MAN 18.310! Their turbo and engine is PURE LOUDNESS! At the back of the bus, you can hear the engine roar very loud when the BC trottles the engine hard! Hmm Lion's city? Why not Lion city as well as Lion city T? And also, the name suits Singapore very well, since Singapore is also known as Lion city, right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Wonder why there are so many Scanias? I estimated that 65% of the coaches were Scanias. Mostly were Scania 360/380(Normal coaches and semi-deckers),310/340(normal coaches) and 420(double decker coaches). MAN chassis were most common with Grassland.SG operators uses ISUZU, Mitsubishi,Hino and Volvo(B7R) for revunue services. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> As for coaches, i dunno why there are so few Volvo in use in Malaysia as coaches. Anyone know why is that?</div></blockquote>some of the operators uses Hino. FYI, Grassland has a 100% MAN bus fleet. Delima express has a big fleet of B7R. Don't underestimate this chassis, because although it has small engine capacity, this one can easily reach 110kmh. I must say, when the bus accelerates, it does produce a nice sound. There are so many scanias because most probably they are slightly cheaper and easier to maintain. There are few volvos around because most operators would look for something cheaper and get those Hino(s). If you wanna get the B7R, you can either try Delima express, Transnational, KKKL or Konsortium express.</div>

I just love the acceleration of the B7Rs, especially its engine noise, but is the rattling as worse as the B7RLEs in Sentosa? I also love the Scanias, especially the unique "tsst tsst tsssst" sound when it shifts gear, maybe because of the Hydraulic/Pneumatic clutch.</div>

No the rattling is not as worse at the sentosa ones, they are more smooth and quieter on the highways. Konsortium has a mix of buses so if you're lucky you'll get a volvo. i've got once with a VinStar body. Very siok. Rain also no leak and very silent.</div>
