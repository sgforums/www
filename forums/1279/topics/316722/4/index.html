              <p>Yes... As the organizer here, what I really feel is that we should befriend with one another not just because of the fact that all of us here are bus enthusiasts, but also more of the "outside bus" stuffs.. I know it's not easy for some of us here as we may have any conflicts, misunderstanding or grudge among/against one another due to certain issues, but in life, we can't be forever having this kind of thoughts, right? (I am not going to continue talking about life stuff here cos it can be a very long one..)</p>
              <p>Hence, the reason for this activity is so as to let everyone here go and have fun to the max, and I believe, through fun activity like this, sometimes, it does help to resolve any misunderstanding/grudge/conflicts among one another here... (I am not targetting any specific person here right now)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forgiveness among one another:</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span>Sounds very simple and easy to say, yet unachievable for some of you here.. If everyone of us here are unwilling to forgive one another for all the mistakes that we have committed in life, then I believe all of us here will be in our own world.. I'm sure all of you here would not want to lead a life that is full of grudge towards other people.. Everyone wants to lead a happy life, and if all of us here start to show forgiveness towards one another even for the grave/serious mistakes that we have made not because we intend to (here again, some of us here may mistreated unintended as intended), I believe that we can stay together as 1 big <strong>warming </strong>and <strong>friendly</strong> bus enthusiasts family/community and really show our care and concern towards one another..</p>
              <p>I hope my message here will serve not as a warning but as a word of encouragement to all of you here, and to really encourage more bus enthusiasts here to take part in this race.. We want a community that is warming and caring, not having "wars" among one another, and we really want to give good reputation to other people (not bus enthusiasts) especially all the SG forumers here..</p>
              <p>Take care everyone and do make yourself free and sign up for this race yeah ^_^</p>
              <p>Cheers =)</p>

              <p>Yes... As the organizer here, what I really feel is that we
              should befriend with one another not just because of the fact that
              all of us here are bus enthusiasts, but also more of the "outside
              bus" stuffs.. I know it's not easy for some of us here as we may
              have any conflicts, misunderstanding or grudge among/against one
              another due to certain issues, but in life, we can't be forever
              having this kind of thoughts, right? (I am not going to continue
              talking about life stuff here cos it can be a very long one..)</p>
              <p>Hence, the reason for this activity is so as to let everyone
              here go and have fun to the max, and I believe, through fun
              activity like this, sometimes, it does help to resolve any
              misunderstanding/grudge/conflicts among one another here... (I am
              not targetting any specific person here right now)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forgiveness
              among one another:</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span>Sounds very simple and
              easy to say, yet unachievable for some of you here.. If everyone of
              us here are unwilling to forgive one another for all the mistakes
              that we have committed in life, then I believe all of us here will
              be in our own world.. I'm sure all of you here would not want to
              lead a life that is full of grudge towards other people.. Everyone
              wants to lead a happy life, and if all of us here start to show
              forgiveness towards one another even for the grave/serious mistakes
              that we have made not because we intend to (here again, some of us
              here may mistreated unintended as intended), I believe that we can
              stay together as 1 big <strong>warming</strong> and
              <strong>friendly</strong> bus enthusiasts family/community and
              really show our care and concern towards one another..</p>
              <p>I hope my message here will serve not as a warning but as a word
              of encouragement to all of you here, and to really encourage more
              bus enthusiasts here to take part in this race.. We want a
              community that is warming and caring, not having "wars" among one
              another, and we really want to give good reputation to other people
              (not bus enthusiasts) especially all the SG forumers here..</p>
              <p>Take care everyone and do make yourself free and sign up for
              this race yeah ^_^</p>
              <p>Cheers =)</p>
