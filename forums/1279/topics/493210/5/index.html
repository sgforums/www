              <p>I hope LTA modifies few existing routes to terminate at Changi
                  Business Park Terminal, going through the CBP central area.</p>
              <p>All the routes introduced in the CBP area have super high
                  loading.</p>
              <p>20 - almost full fleet DD from a full fleet SD when
                  introduced</p>
              <p>35 - getting to a full fleet DD by regular conversions of SDs
                  -&gt; DD as the loading at Xilin from the CBP area is v high. You
                  see even DDs in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span> during
                  peak hours.</p>
              <p>47 - SDs are not able to tank the load between CBP &amp; Tanah
                  Merah. I wouldn't advocate SD-&gt;DD conversion simply because the
                  loading between Tanah Merah - Marine Parade is strictly between
                  30-40 pax.</p>
              <p>118 - DDs did v well on this service since very first month of
                  introduction.</p>
              <p>* There could be possible options that LTA can try to divert one
                  more service from Tanah Merah to CBP given the high loading. They
                  could do it to 38, 45, 46, 48 or extend 26. Whatever they do, it
                  cannot be done standalone but have to tie in with some other
                  changes in the region.</p>
              <p>* Personally I would prefer if it is svc 46 as it would help
                  connect Bedok North Town and DTL3 @ Bedok Reservoir to CBP area.
                  Also help with the lukewarm loading the service has. </p>

              <p>CBP's demand is quite visible from the number of non-CBD premium services serving there. Can certainly introduce one or two more services (preferrably semi-express) that roughly trace the route, possibly one to Hougang/Sengkang, and one to Bedok/Eunos. Aside CBP Terminal, UEC can also be a good place to start the route.</p>
              <p>Any diversions should take into consideration the loading balance on the remainder sections of the route.</p>

              <p>38: How exactly will it be diverted though? If it just touches the outskirt of CBP (Expo MRT), not sure if it will be useful. If it goes all the way to the centre of CBP (like 47, 118), will probably be too winding and may duplicate too much with 20/47.</p>
              <p>45: If that happens, a serview from Bedok North Ave 3 needs to be diverted to UEC to maintain connection to a few shops along Bedok Road. 46 cannot because it's simply duplicative to 14. 18 may actually be a good choice.</p>
              <p>46: Will need to see how many people from Bedok South will use DTL3 when it opens. (Actually I don't think they will go all the way to Bedok North MRT, as DTL3 itself is extremely inconvenient.)</p>
              <p>17A: I don't think it's very winding - if you see it as just a service from Bedok North Road and Ave 4 to CBP.</p>

              <p>Doubtful, seeing that there has not yet been large scale modification of services in any previous years. I think LTA may start with a few trials on those with really bad routing/timing/demand first (but the ones listed above are good candidates).</p>

              <ul style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px;">
              <li><span style="color: #333333;">38 could be a possible choice,
                      with alternatives (for faster travel) 20 to Tampines central, 12 to
                      Tampines east and Bedok south, and 24 to Bedok central, but it may
                      end up being seen as too duplicative of 20 and 47.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA: Yes svc 38 could be diverted as
                      there are alternatives.</span></li>
              <li style="color: #333333;"> </li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;">Diverting 45 may be difficult (?)
                      if the Tanah Merah -- UEC Rd connection is not backed up, leaving
                      more stress on 14.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA: 45 if
                      diverted can be helpful to connect Bedok North, Eunos, Hougang,
                      Serangoon and AMK. But this will need some more change such as 26
                      to be extended to UEC via Tanah Merah or get 46 to be diverted via
                      Tanah Merah to UEC.</span><br></li>
              <li style="color: #333333;"> </li>
              <li><span style="color: #333333;">46's current north-south routing
                      makes it difficult to divert east to CBP, so probably not the best
                      choice. Better for optimization around other areas (such as within
                      Tampines town or into Pasir Ris).</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA: Actually can. What will be missed is Bedok
                      South Ave 3 which also has svc 506 connecting to Bedok Reservoir
                      MRT in future if required. There aren't too many BTO blocks around
                      Bedok South Ave 3 or UEC (anyway). </span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #333333;">17A and 506 could be considered.
                      48 too, but not too winding.</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">NV: 506 can stay as it is and 17A modification
                      will make it very winding. 48 can but will be too duplicative with
                      svc 47. Prefer some service from Bedok North (45 or 46) to go to
                      CBP instead.</span></li>

              <p> I think 506 should be terminated at this CBP Terminal. Since it is a express serivce serving jurong east and the east side of singapore and our mrt is not that stable it should be good for 506 to go around CBP. actually LTA should let 506 go back to changi airport as it original planned </p>

              <p>Yes, and also 858, which is debatable as it loops at the airport, but does not really terminate there.</p>
              <p>And by the way, it would be great if you could use the right word, "Singapore's longest route", because there are even longer routes around the world.  You can see tons when you cross the Johor Straits. (Unless your world = Singapore)</p>

              <p>I hate SBST to the core. Its buses are now coming later than ever, and they have zero sense on deployments. Their buses are getting worse than SMRT's (which rly tells a lot), and they can STILL act like they're boss by domineering LTA on bus types, depot space allocation etc. My area here, svc 2 has become a world better after GA took over — full fleet DDs, punctual buses and well-maintained, clean fleet. So good riddance to SBST!! Of you think Yishun is bad enough you would not want to imagine SBST taking it over.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, it is in direction towards new bridge road terminal.</p>
              <p>Even if it is true for no 2, it is certainly not true for no 6 and 386. I have met many situations. Recently I was at one bus stop waiting for service 386. The driver saw me and refused to open the door and drove off. Luckily there was another bus 386 just behind. The driver saw what has happened ahead and apologized to me on behalf of the earlier driver. I just smiled and boarded. So how? Is Go Ahead good or bad like this??? </p>
              <p>So it boils down to people perception only. Good or no good all depends on circumstances. Does not really mean Sbst or go Ahead is good or no good. So let's do the sensible thing of not condemning sbst or smrt or tower transit or go ahead. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
