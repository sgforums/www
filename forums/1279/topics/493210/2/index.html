              no more new services to be launched (svc 883 is the new service in
              the Sembawang/Yishun package) so this suggests any new bus routes
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span></strong> be accompanied

                          Do not expect new feeders at Sengkang. If have, they would already exist. Use your brain think about it. Otherwise, wonder why they drag so long (more than 10 years)? Anyway contrary to popular belief there is no new bus stop at Compassvale crescent... I think the one at Swimming pool (farm way) also can forget about it. No chance for feeder. More likely is trunk to enhance intra town connectivity.

                      Tuas don't need so many buses... the current number is sufficient.... 193 not yet WAB.... at most one more is enough for Tuas. Jurong West Boon Lay and Taman Jurong will have around 1k new flats coming up. 240 already quite pack, but maybe after fleet upgrade still can handle.... Bulim and Clean Tech Park will need a dedicated bus service when more offices open there.

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, as I had always said in the past and I shall repeat it again, the new bus stop for those new compassvale crescent flats is actually at the road on the side called Sengkang east rd (blk 286B).

              <p>I don't expect bus stops inside compssvale crescent as it is considered one way due to only one turn to compassvale street. Tell LTA to prove me wrong in 2017 if they decide to erect bus stops and put buses inside compassvale crescent. I stand to be corrected and challenged. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, oh ok. Loop is still acceptable. This part of the area is really quite a contentious area where it can make or break a new bus service. Not far from Sengkang mrt. But neither near too. Can walk but also cannot walk sometimes. If introduce a service just for looping, also considered too short. Headache sia. This is also why service 83 gets some loading because people boarded at Sengkang interchange compass one mall with hands carrying plastic bags and alighted at compassvale st bus stop.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile walk few min to compassvale street take 83. For those flats near to Sengkang east rd, can walk there. For those flats near to compassvale LRT, can walk there as the bus stop at LRT has more bus services there. Meanwhile, hope LTA really pulls in a service to loop at compassvale crescent since the expanded interchange is completed. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
