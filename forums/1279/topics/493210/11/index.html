              <p>Anyways, pertaining to kampong bahru ter, it would be quite interesting too, as there could be potential changes to 1. the CT directs: would they be withdrawn (CT18)? Would they be renumbered? Would they be extended/amended to a great extent? Or would there be minimal changes; and 2. 120-122.

              <p>121 loading is high between Tiong Bahru and Telok Blangah. The other stretch to NBR is low.</p>
              <p>120 and 122 are terrible...</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>But I don't expect any changes on 121 and 122. At most it's only 120 that could possibly be amended because it would lose the link to Outram Park MRT.</p>

              <p>120 - Telok Blangah Heights &lt;&gt; Redhill MRT</p>
              <p>121 - Telok Blangah Rise &lt;&gt; Tiong Bahru MRT</p>
              <p>122 - poor loading throughout due to badly designed route but important for Dawson estate. If re-routed loading can be very high given the high number of new flats and tall buildings.</p>

              <p>About the increment of a particular bus model at a depot, this means they are doing fleet standardization, which is a good thing as this enables operators to purchase materials in large quantities and enjoy cost savings as a result; economies of scale.</p>

               <p>Imagine you have x amount of MAN food that can feed z amount of MAN buses. Obviously itÃ¢â¬â¢s better to feed z number of MAN buses than any quantity smaller than z.</p>
                                              <p>Also, if you concentrate all the resources at one place, you would minimize duplication of resources, which would lead to costs savings.</p>
                                          <p>After all, buying 3x amount of MAN food for 3z number of MAN buses is cheaper than buying 4x or more amount of MAN food for 3z number of MAN buses.</p>
                                      <p>Thus, on the concern about Citaro buses concentrating at airport bus routes or at certain depots, I can see where they are coming from.</p>
                              <p>(Just like F1 got pit stop to repair vehicles during the race, airport bus routes also need to have a Ã¢â¬Åpit stopÃ¢â¬ï¿½ at the airport in case the bus breaks down, right? So, itÃ¢â¬â¢s better to have resources for just one bus model than to have resources for many bus models)</p>
