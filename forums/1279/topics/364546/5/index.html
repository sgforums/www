              <p>unlike the previous race, this one is based on most points wins. Not based on who comes first. At the same time, it shows that SBS2615P, jayh272416 &amp; SBS8533C are one of the most hardcore busfans around our community. One example is taking photos of bus cameos. They managed to get 30 pics of cameos within the whole afternoon. This is not an easy task to accomplish as they must remember tons of bus rego in order to get the correct rego which is doing an cameo service and also requires lots of running around and patience and they also managed to accomplished many other tasks which is why they aced the entire race.</p>
              <p>However, the organizing committee is quite disappointed with tintinspartan as not only he let everybody waited and dragged the starting and ending time by 30 mins, but also he woke up late at 11am. Half and hour after the race had flag off. If only he got the initiative to wake up early at around 8am then another team could have been formed perfectly.</p>

              <p>However, I will delete the file by 2359 hrs, 26th June 2009 to avoid anyone other than the intended parties from getting the pictures. As the file contains all the participants photos, you should use them at your own discreet, preferably, not to use any photos other than those of your group or yourself. You also know that forum posting of photos is the most insecure way of sharing, even sharing through Facebook itself would pose a risk. Downloading would turn away most ill-intentions, but this is not the most secure way on Earth, of course, applies to the Universe. I cannot stop an alien from downloading the file.</p>

              tintinspartan as not only he let everybody waited and dragged the
              starting and ending time by 30 mins, but also he woke up late at
              11am. Half and hour after the race had flag off. If only he got the
              initiative to wake up early at around 8am then another team could

You also know that forum posting of photos is the most insecure way of sharing, even sharing through Facebook itself would pose a risk.
