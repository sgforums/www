              <p>1) For the last few years, I have been emailing LTA etc regarding issues with current svcs or suggestions on new routes and so on. But most of the time I will receive 'very poor, ridiculous' replies from them. Can anyone share your experience/s as well?</p>

              <p>2) I noticed that new bus stops have been installed along Chai Chee St/Dr on the opposite direction of where svc 222 plies. Any info anyone?

              <p>Granted, the LTA deals with a lot of feedback every day - many of which are rubbish suggestions. </p>
              <p>But I agree some of their replies are very stupid. Sometimes they are just trying to find an excuse, or be defensive in instances where there are gaps but don't really want to do anything about it. For instance, when I feedbacked about an MP-Kembangan link, they acknowledged that there were no links but "stressed that there are alternatives". And their alternative is one that I've see NO ONE using because it is so stupid: Take 42 to Flamingo Valley and then take 40 to East Coast Rd, and then walk from Roxy Square at East Coast Rd under the sheltered walkway. </p>
              <p>Stupid on many levels. For those of you familiar with 42, it goes in and out of Fidelio Street, so one must endure this loop in and out, and make a gigantic loop from Kembangan, just to get to Flamingo Valley where one can transfer to 40. Then 40's frequency is also not fantastic and it doesn't go directly to Marine Parade Rd. And while PP is accessible from East Coast Rd via Roxy Sq, other amenities in MP are not. </p>
              <p>It probably will take you a good 30 minutes using LTA's suggestion, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">when one can just shoot down Frankel Av or Siglap Rd in a taxi from Kembangan MRT, and be at Marine Parde in 5 mins. </span></p>

              <p>True enough, we understand that LTA themselves have their own guidelines and other stuffs to look at etc... but at times they are really, really absurd. For my case, I rmbr a LTA officer asking me to take 17 (from Bdk Nth Ave 4) to Bedok MRT &amp; take the train to TM....one whole round..!</p>

We have looked into your request to spilt Service 243 into two services. Our assessment is that the spilt would adversely affect existing passengers with lost links to amenities, ie. Gek Poh Shopping Centre, Pioneer Mall, etc. In additional, residents who now enjoy the direct link will need to make additional transfers, which will impact them with longer journey time.</p>

The current scheduled frequency for Service 243 is 4 to 9 minutes during the morning and evening peak hours.</p>

Currently, the Quality of Service (QoS) Standard set by the Public Transport Council (PTC) on passenger loading requires that the average loading does not exceed 95% daily during the weekday peak periods on each bus service. We have checked the 1st two bus stops which Service 243 calls at after leaving the bus interchange during the evening peak hours. Our checks at the bus stop outside Blk 669 along Jurong West Street 64 showed that Service 243G operated with majority of the trips below 80% utilisation when the buses leave the bus stop.  At the bus stop outside Blk 665A along Jurong West Street 62, all trips had the utilisation rate of less than 75%. Please provide us with more details such as actual location, date and time where overcrowding was experienced so as to allow us to investigate, as well as follow-up with SBST.</p>

                                          <p>I appreciate their effort to check the data, and write a tactful reply. I am convinced with the figures they provided, that it was just me thinking that the service is bad. It was probably due to the long queues and waiting times that made me think that the service is bad, where actually it is good. As commuters, we should accept what we have and enjoy the ride.</p>
                              
                                                       <p>I stopped writing to them to feedback on bus services ever since I received that reply, as they had given me the assurance that I can count on them to deliver a good quality public bus service.</p>
                                                  
                                             <p>Honestly, our public bus service is good. As compared to the other states like Johor Bahru, Penang and Sarawak, ours is the best.</p>

              <p>I feel that they are reasonable in their replies.</p>
              <p>Back then, in year 2013, I wrote an e-mail to them regarding bus
              service 243, after observing very long queues for bus services 243G
              and 243W at the bus interchange.</p>
              <p>I suggested splitting 243 into two.</p>
              <p>They took two weeks to reply.</p>
              <p>This is their reply:</p>
              <p>Names obviously faked to protect identity.</p>
              <p>We have to understand that they are the authorities. They know
              the data. They know what they are doing.</p>
              <p>Ever since that e-mail, I stopped writing to them to feedback on
              bus services, because I feel assured that our public bus service is
              in good hands.</p>
              <p>Last time is 243 have long queues, now is 193. I think if
              someone writes to them to complain about 193, their reply will be
              something like this.</p>
              <p>Anyway, rather than complain, we should appreciate that we have
              a good quality public bus service. The public bus service in
              neighbouring states like Johor Bahru is worse.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not directly related to bus routes, but I'd previously sent feedback (in 2014) abt the posters at MRT stations, showing bus svcs to other MRT stns.

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">(eg <a href="http://bus.mytransport.sg/ADM.PDF">Admiralty MRT</a>, where 904, 913, 964, 965 to Woodlands MRT are listed under bus stops on both sides of the road.

              <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">Based on our checks on 9 September 2015 at Yishun Interchange, there was an instance of prolonged wait time of 23 minutes from 3.16pm to 3.39pm, which you have encountered. This was because one of the scheduled trips did not depart from the interchange, due to the bus captain scheduled for the trip calling in sick. We would like to assure you that the long wait time experienced at Yishun Interchange is likely to be one-off. Our further checks for the month of September indicate that the overall reliability of Service 103 is good, with more than 95% of trips departing the interchange at intervals of 16 minutes or less.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">In addition, you have also mentioned in your feedback that other buses on Service 103 were in the interchange, but were not dispatched to reduce the wait time. Based on our records, SBS6558U was the first among the buses which you have listed in your feedback to arrive at the interchange, at 3:23pm, and was dispatched at 3.39pm, which you subsequently boarded. Some break time was necessary for the bus captain. That said, SBS Transit Ltd (SBST) could have made some adjustment to the timing of the trips to space out the bus departure timings and shorten the wait time of passengers like yourself. We have reminded SBST that they are expected to make live adjustment to minimise the impact of any unplanned service delays on passengers.</p>

The capacity provision of Service 103 is also adequate, with 95% of the buses less than two-thirds full when they departed the bus stop After ST Airport Services. However, we note that there was a trip at a higher bus utilisation of more than 75% and some commuters might face difficulties boarding the bus if on-board passengers do not move to the rear of the buses. We will request SBST to remind their bus drivers to request passengers to move to the rear of the buses.  </p>

Since the launch of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), we have added 2 buses to Service 103 and an additional 6 buses in view of the route extension in June 2015. This has helped to provide additional capacity for passengers taking this service and at the same time, shorten the waiting time.</p>
