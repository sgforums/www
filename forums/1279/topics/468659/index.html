            <div class='col-md body'><p>A 42-year-old woman was killed on Tuesday morning after she was hit by a bus at about 7.35am.<br><br>It is understood that she was crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing when a double-decker bus running the service 78 route, turning from Commonwealth Avenue West onto Clementi Avenue 3 ran her over, pinning her underneath the bus. She was dragged for about 5 metres before the bus came to a stop. Paramedics pronounced her dead on the spot after arriving on the scene at 7.50am.<br><br>SBS Transit's senior vice-president for corporate communications, Tammy Tan said the company was very sorry that the accident has happened and their priority is to render assistance to the deceased family. Ms Tan added that the bus captain has been suspended from driving duties with immediate effect, pending the outcome of investigations.<br><br>The police have confirmed that the 47-year-old Singaporean driver is assisting with investigations.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/woman-hit-and-dragged-bus-clementi-avenue-3-20130423">http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/woman-hit-and-dragged-bus-clementi-avenue-3-20130423</a></p></div>

              <p>now bus is auto gear, unlight last time manual. ilove manual gear controls. change gear from high to extreme low, just step on brake, hold and shift gear to neutral, then can immediately shift down to very low gear. but depending on the steps down the gear level, youmay need to apply the appropriate force down on th brakes and duration on hold to avoid suddent jerk and stress on the gear shift system....that was the old days.</p>
              <p>i have not much information about this case. so what their investigation is about. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think in general for saftey measures, pedestrians should not stand too near to corssing's edge. even the pedestrian walk turns green, its better to observe any on coming vehicles, judge their speed and braking motion. you wont know the driver's state of mind of what how he was controlling the wheel on braking. not sure about time to brake evffective dont cross yet even on pedestrian green light.</p>

              <p>Probably.</p>
              <p>Some of the drivers also tend to assume that the pedestrians are aware of a bus turning and turn with/without horn or alerting. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Others just observe before the driver reaches the traffic junction to turn or use the mirrors to check.</span></p>
              <p>If possible, vehicles should install a control sensor? Or the driver can use the CCTV, provided it's capturing at the angle.</p>

              <p>It is difficult for the bc to see at the junction. U go to yck terminal every morning n u stand at the junction where sv72/13/162 buses turn out to amk ave 8 n see how the bc look when turning.  ESP for sv72/72b buses which are alway full. The bc usually see here see there before turning.  Not easy at all.  </p>

              <p>Car drivers also have to twist their heads, motorcyclists, cyclists also.</p>
              <p>That blind spot at the rear especially from 90 deg to 135 deg on both sides from the front is very dangerous because mirrors can't really cover those spots.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SBST practice junction drill as well as what to do upon approaching zebra crossings but sadly almost none practice this now ever since the influx of China drivers. Not only they challenge you the pedestrian on a crossing but also will horn and tailgate at other motorist too.First thing first they ought to change their aggressive way of driving before even talk about blind spots.I speak this as a motorbike rider,Car driver and bus driver.</p></div>
