              <p>yup! thats an excellent way..</p>
              <p>anyway look at 147... a good example.. its at reduced frequency obviously..many people choose to wait for it and squeeze into crowded buses... although most peopl are taking train back..</p>
              <p>anyway for CCL, most stations has 2-directional roads serving it... unlike NEL Potong Pasir - Dhoby Gaut where it only calls at North-bound roads.<br><br>still, over sometimes, commuters travelling patterns should be observed if they are switching to MRT or remain on buses</p>

              <p><br>Yes at that time if 147 still continues to loop at Potong Pasir after its amendment to Hougang Ctrl, the travelling time to the CBD from Hougang Ctrl would be longer.

With the amendment of 82 to serve Hougang New Town, there was also a public outcry for those who live at the stretch of Upp Serangoon Rd. Those affected passengers would take 327 to Hougang (South) and transfer another bus to the city or either take 84, 136 or 153 from Upper Serangoon Rd. As for 83, the route was withdrawn with 147 covering parts of the 83 route.<br><br>Although the strength of public outcry had reached the level of inconvenience, TransitLink has already point out the problems.</p>

              <p>14 could serve ppl to East Coast/ Upp East Coast from Orchard. But issue is back then where are u going to find a terminating point for the bus?</p>
