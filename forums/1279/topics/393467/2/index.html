              This is true...<br><br>- When the Circle Line opened, commuters would directly travel to Paya laber MRT and transfer to Circle Line and travel to Stadium MRT.<br>- Service 11 demand would drop as commuters will favour the MRT to save travelling time. Which means time travelling on Circle Line would be shorter than travelling on Service 11.

              <p><br>I have been to Tokyo before and I am quite familiar with the railway system in Tokyo, it is totally different compare to Singapore. The commuter trains serve as a main transportation, plus there are also many different subway and railway lines operating within Tokyo metropolitan/outskirt areas. Note that some private railway lines do duplicate with the main Tokyo JR line and the different railway companies can compete with each other. Another special thing I observe is that the subway lines do have through services to continue along the private railway commuter lines to the outskirt areas.</p>

              <p>Service 147 was spared from rationalisation from all other services, becoming the only service left to ply the NEL route. This is to allow choices fro commuters, as good public transport systems should allow commuters to have choices. It also serves as a service to bring people from the stations to segments of the line where there is no station. To take note: Bendemeer Road, Jalan Besar and Bencoolen street are not exactly on the NEL.</p>
              <p>So, rationlisation should still take place, like what happened to Services 81, 82, 106, 111, while some services should continue to retain. In the case of CCL, it is built in a way where around 50% of the line does not follow any road (quite high), but for stage 1 and 2, there is this stretch that follows (Serangoon - Paya Lebar) with bus service, and seriously speaking quite short. So, I guess that if possible, Service 70 will be one that is rationalised (cut to Serangoon/Tai Seng). If we look at the services rationalised, it's all in the manner where one side of the route has MRT service, the other without. Some services are likely to be rationalised such that they are linked to MRT stations instead. Could 158 probably loop in to Stadium?</p>

              <p>Agreed. Tokyo's subway coverage is unparalleled. With the Fukutoshin Line, every road inside the "Yamanote Ring" that can be dug is dug for subway.</p>
              <p>But the investment on subway is worth it for them because of the immense flow of passengers within and also into and out of Tokyo everyday. We can never reach the kind of coverage required given our population size without paying too much and underutilizing them, so it might still be more economical to have buses plying like they are now, and not as feeders from major stations like Tokyo has.</p>

So, I guess that if possible, Service 70 will be one that is rationalised (cut to Serangoon/Tai Seng). If we look at the services rationalised, it's all in the manner where one side of the route has MRT service, the other without. Some services are likely to be rationalised such that they are linked to MRT stations instead. Could 158 probably loop in to Stadium?</p>

              <p><br>If this is the case I also feel the same for service 24 too. It duplicates service 22 from AMK to MacPherson (except for the Serangoon MRT part) and also parallel along the CCL and EWL lines. At most service 24 might cutback to Bedok (becoming the former service 34 route).</p>
