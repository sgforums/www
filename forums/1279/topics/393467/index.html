              <p>Too early to make assumption bro, and I dun think any of those mentioned would be affected, especially withdrawing of 24 and 43. Those you mentioned I believe were due to they passby Paya Lebar and Serangoon, but withdrawing would deeply affect those passengers going beyond.</p>

              <p><br>Agree with you. Services worst to worst will just have some route amendment, i.e. plying on other roads, but terminating of buses would probably remain, merging quite unlikely.</p>

              <p>Why make assumptions/speculations that services are going to be withdrawn or amended when LTA has not annouced anything about bus rationalisation yet?Serangoon and Paya Lebar are high passenger corridor areas, and the Circle line has only 3 carriages. Do you think they can support the increasing future demand? If they anyhow withdraw or shortern any bus routes, there will be many complaints again in future. If the bus network is still comprehensive enough, why break it? And travelling and demand patterns are so much different from the last decade, LTA wants people to take more buses as well, making such rationalisations is as good as shooting themselves in their own foot.</p>
              <p>In the NEL bus rationalisation in the early 2000s, TIBS also withdrawn service 520 (which I don't understand why withdrawing this useful services is approved.), shortern service 106. So if it is based on your speculations again, I think service 853 will likely be withdrawn, service 61 will be shortern to New Bridge Road ter, service 966 and 985 to be intergrated into one service. Since the parent company do want to see more ridership on their rails to earn back the monsy asap, and compromising bus services instead.</p>
              <p>As a frequent bus commuter, I won't wish to see any bus services along any future rails lines to be adversely affected. It can only makes things worse, especially supply cannot meet the demand in the future years.</p>

              <p>With rising of people in Singapore, I also think that rationization is not a wise choice, as buses serves to some locations which trains can't.</p>

              <p>Whether some bus routes get cleaved or withdrawn or not is totally up to the bus companies and the relevant management authorities. If the company finds it economically unwise to continue operating a route that may lose alot of passenger volume due to new transport alternatives then it may choose to cut the route, either fully or partially.</p>
              <p>Of course, let's not forget that cutting too many routes might leave commuters with lesser alternatives.</p>

              <p><br>Would like to add on to service 11, this service currently serves as a link between Kallang MRT to Kallang Leisure Park. But with the new CCL Stadium MRT this bus service will very likely be withdrawn too.</p>

              <p>Impossible that central planning have big impact towards current bus services as the transport ministry have said that they have no plans for a big revamp for the current bus routes and they have ruled out cutting long haul services also.</p>
