In July 1999, SBS took over service 866 and it became today's service 86 in 2000, solely operated by Hougang Depot.<br><br>Service 55 originally terminated at Ang Mo Kio Terminal but was extended to Bishan via Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 in 1994.<br><br>Service 134 was cut short to Bishan from Ang Mo Kio in 1992 due to poor demand. Service 105 was rerouted with service 104 to swap roads, with service 104 serving Bishan MRT and service 105 going by Lor Chuan. In 1993 however, SBS decided to integrate service 104 and service 134 to form today's service 54, which also goes to New Bridge Rd. Service 156 was then introduced to bridge the gap from Seranggon Interchange to Bishan MRT. In 2000, service 156 was extended to Sengkang.<br><br>Bishan Services Now: 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and Feeder 410<br></div>
