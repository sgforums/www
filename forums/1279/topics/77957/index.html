But way before 165 was extended to HG Ctrl from AMK, it was rather packed in O405s and I think that it's a wrong choice to extend 165 to Hougang and full control by HGDEP (sort of bad luck charm). </div></blockquote>I took a fully packed VO3x before... The main load comes from Serangoon North to Upp Thomson Rd at around 6 plus in the morning, provided there is no 166 or 132 just before 165. Most of the load comes from school students... Must say that 165 doesn't deserve so many DD buses. Should transfer some over to 74 which needs them more badly than 165. Another thing is 165 is getting more and more VO3xs these days if you notice.</div>
