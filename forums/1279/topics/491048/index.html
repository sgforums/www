              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">My Android application, hopefully will help for you guys visually on:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">a. Suggesting a route ...</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">b. Bus loading ...</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">The application will display on Google Map:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">a. The bus routes of all services running at a [bus stop], you need to input the bus stop id.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">b. The 'originating' and 'terminating' of the bus routes.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">c. All buses [up to 3 buses per route if location coordinates are available] that will be arriving at that bus stops. Information obtain from LTA datamall [bus arrival].</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d. All buses will visually provide:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">- the expected arrvial time</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-the service number</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-the bus feature [WAB]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-the bus loading</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-if Next, Subsequent or NextSubsequent</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">e. All buses will visually provide:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">- the loading factor [LTA standard ], Marker Color Green for 'Seats Available', Amber for 'Standing Available', ' Red for 'Limited Available'.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">f. All buses will visually identify:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">- the NextBus, SubsequentBus, NextSubsequentBus. They are distinct by the size of of the Markers.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">g. The map will identify all Traffic Incidents and Roadworks on.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> [Example: Buses arriving at bus stop outside Orchard MRT at Orchard Boulevard]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">- refer to album link below</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">[Example: Zoom into above location]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-refer to album link below</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">[Example: At a busstop along Commonwealth Avenue]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">-refer to album link below</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Currently what is bad:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">a. Map loading may take up to 30s or more [depending on number of bus routes at that bus stop].</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">b. Only search by bus stop id.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">c. Only visually [Google Map] output. Textual output not available.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d. No legend that explain the various bus route color code. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">e. Have yet paid credits to the datasource owner. There are external datasource other than LTA datamall, needed in capturing the bus route and bus stop co-ordinates information.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Anyway I am eager to show you guys what I have had so far.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Once (If) ready, this will be a private application.</p>

Blue for 11 or more bus services, Green for 6 to 10 bus services, Amber for 4 or 5 bus services, and Red for 3 or less services. Each bus stop will furnish with bus services number serving at that bus stop. [There are 4000+ bus stops, be patient if you query for All Bus Stops]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">ii. All MOE Schools. Each school icons are color-coded, Blue for primary, Green for Secondary, Amber for JC or CI and Red for Mixed level Schools.</p>

              <p>BTW, if you enter a bus stop id, the map will show you the bus arrival for all the buses arriving at the bus stops, however it only shows you the loading information, that is if there  seats available, standing available or limited standings.</p>

              <p>Too many buses before evening peak hour</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Runaway Buses before just before peak hours</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are too many buses before evening peak hours (6.00 pm to 6.20 pm) , the buses are quite empty. The reason is bus captains are trying to avoiding peak hour jam, the first one to get caught will be late to reach bus terminal by at least 20 minutes and likely miss the schedule time.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So the bus captains are driving very fast in order to reach the bus stop before peak hour commuters arriving at the bus stop.
