            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A mentally disabled boy and danger on train 035/3351</span></strong><br>I took MRT train number 035/3351 (035 is the run number and 3351 is the carriage number, in this case its the first carriage) on 4th August 2006, from Clementi station to Outram Park station. I saw the driver wearing earphones when the train entered the station at Clementi.<br>The driver sounded the horn several times when train entered Redhill station, after which a mentally disabled boy of around age 14 boarded the train shouting loudly. He even attempted to harass several passengers. In order not to disrupt regular service I decided not to press the emergency button, but to knock on the driver cab door in order to alert the driver of the situation. He did not reply until I alighted at Outram Park, when he came out from the side door, and I told him about the boy and danger it posed to passengers. He agreed to report it to his superiors and in that time the boy had already alighted and walking towards North East Line station.<br>I feel very sad again, for the boy and for the passengers who got frightened in the scenario. However I am not questioning the existence of these people in our society, but rather if their actions are monitored and if they are well looked after.<br>Plus, the driver of the train was listening to earphones, presumably a MP3 player at the time when he was driving. I saw drivers of SMRT trains reading newspapers and even playing handphone games and sms-ing while on the line of duty. What type of service is this? We definitely would not want another Clementi Station accident of 1993!<br>On a side note, I was in Japan for the entire of December last year for vacation and I was impressed by their self-discipline. Train drivers do not read papers or even wander their eyes off the panel and tracks ahead. They are obliged to point at signals and acknowledge them, sound the horn before entering a station (this is very effective in lowering cases of suicide, hence I hope SMRT would adopt this measure). The accuracy of the train stopping at the designated spot is legendary, within centimetres.<br>This comment would also be sent to SMRT for their reference, and I do hope that forumnites can comment on this incident and give your thoughts. Thank You.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah...cannot compare japan and sinapore lah...when i was in japan, the train driver make announcement prior to arrival at each station and even the ticket inspector, he will apologise for the inconveniences before commencing to inspect our tickets.  And he apologised once more after that, at each carriage.<br><br>thats what i call service.  Singapore ?  pre-recorded messages and sometimes even play the wrong one...bugis when the train is reaching city hall, etc...<br><br>Then again, cannot compare lah, train driver in Japan paid more than train driver in Singapore lah....so more motivated to work bah...</div>

It appeared that one train had stopped at the station for longer than usual after experiencing a technical fault, and then a second westward train hit the first. 156 commuters were injured, many of whom were on their way to work. Eight were admitted to three hospitals, while the rest received outpatient treatment.<br><br>A four-member independent panel was subsequently formed by the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) to conduct an inquiry into the accident. The panel was chaired by Chua Koon Hoe, deputy director-general of the Public Works Department, with the members Chang Meng Teng, deputy chairman of the Public Transport Council, and Dr. Natarajan Varaprasad, principal of Temasek Polytechnic. Low Tien Sio, MRTC's general manager (project administration) served as the secretary.<br><br>The results of the inquiry were announced by the MRTC on 19 October 1993. Shortly after the accident The Straits Times had reported that an oil spill on the tracks was responsible for the second train's inability to brake in time. Some 50 litres of oil had spilled from a locomotive doing maintenance work on the track in the pre-dawn hours of 5 August. SMRT staff had been alerted to the spill and had despatched a cleaning crew to the neighbouring Buona Vista station, but approval to access the tracks was delayed. Already ten trains had reported difficulty braking on the track that morning. The 11th train had had to use its emergency brakes upon reaching Clementi station, and while it was waiting for the brakes to be recharged so that it could move off again, the 12th approached the station and could not brake in time to avoid hitting the 11th train.<br><br>The Communications Minister at that time, Mah Bow Tan, said that as the SMRT staff followed procedures and none were found to be negligent, so no staff would be punished. However SMRT promised to look into the problem of oil spillage from maintenance locomotives by replacing the hoses and oil seals on all locomotives, checking all locomotives for leaks upon their return to depots, and assigning a station master to inspect tracks for oil. Procedures were also amended so that trains would not move off from stations preceding the spill until it had been cleaned up.<br><br>No similar incidents have occurred at Clementi or any other MRT station since.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To my understanding, the operations of the trains are not fully automatic. I do agree that the drivers, or operators, do not need to make announcements and so on, but the operation of the train is definitely not automatic<br>The operator controls the train using a control stick, from P4 which means power 4 to B4, brake 4 and ultimately the emergency brake. It is aligned vertically and against normal configuration, the brakes are at the lower end and power at the upper end.<br>The train system follows the Japanese system of ATO, Automatic Train Operation. However, do not get fooled by the words, they are simply a monitoring tool to monitor maximum speeds, start and stop. If the train's ATO detector passes by a ATO emmiter which is on the tracks, and emmiting the 'Stop' signal, the alarm would sound. SMRT uses this system's design to install emergency stop buttons on platforms, and hence as the train departs the previous stop, the 'Stop' signal will stop the train. If the train is on its way, then speed limitations will be implemented, all the way to zero.<br>There are green lights signalling the maximum speed, in increments of 20kph. Hence there is really no automation, it just cannot pass the maximum speed. How do I know that the trains are not fully automated? In very heavy rain, the train might overrun the platform. The driver would be at fault, not the systems then, as the train did not pass over the ATO emmiter, no alarm would be sounded.<br>I am not comparing Japanese train systems, as their network is much larger and drivers work shorter shifts, but I am just giving a comparison. I did not want to argue in this topic, but just to give evryone a gauge as to things going along.</div>

The button is called Emergency Communication Button. It is only used to communicate with SMRT staff, &amp; not the emergency stop button like those found on the station platforms.

If the train is on the move, it will stop at the next station.<br><br>How do we know what sort of situation that warrants us to press the emergency call button? The threat of being fined $5000 is good enough to deter most of us to do anything.

Dunno if that's true.<br><br>Am not sure if others in the carriage did anything. Perhaps could be us singaporeans being typically impassive.</div>

During heavy rain, you see the orange lights above the emergency exit lighted up. That's when the trains are under Coded Manual. This is when the driver operates the train, but it will not be completely under his control. Computers will still limit the maximum speed.<br>Sometimes, if it starts to rain heavily all of a sudden, the train might stop between stations and the driver has to switch to Coded Manual himself.<br><br>And it is in this situation, the drivers give rubbish driving! There was once, when approaching a station, the driver released and applied the brakes 9 times, causing so much jerking! And in the end, still didn't stop properly...</div>

Practically even off-duty employees are not allowed into the cab during operations. And it is too dependant on what train you are on, the Kawasaki/Nippon Sharyo/Tokyu Car Corp. or the Siemens train, as different trains have different systems or different modes of operations. The one you witnessed might be the abnormal all-automatic operation, which I do not think they will use frequently.<br>As to other forumnites, if you are in the first carriage the next time you take a train, do try to hear the cracking sound as the operator pushes the stick forward, which powers up the train.</div>

An old lady/man fainted, press it? A kid fell down and got injured, press? A plastic bag that seems suspicious, although there are condensation on the outside and the bag is new, you press it and security comes along, finds frozen fish and other food inside, although you are adamantly sure you saw wires sticking out and meanwhile holding thousands of commuters back, is that fair?<br>Yes, but we must be sure that it is a life-threatening affair then we press it. As to the button being abused several times a day, I do not agree. Personally I did not encounter this and neither did any of my 'informers' did. We are just too kind, being labelled by our 'fellow citizens' as 'typical Singaporeans'. Are not you typical too? You complain (not anyone here) and you are typical.<br>If I pressed the button on 4th of August on train no.3351, I would be accused as being 'typical Singaporean', but are not my accusers 'typical Singaporeans' too, those who are 'selfish' and 'un-caring'? It is all relative in all means. Ask Albert Einstein that, please, all people of Singapore who label others as 'typical Singaporeans'.</div>
