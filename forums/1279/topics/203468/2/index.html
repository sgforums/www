There are many networks around the world that uses ATO operation (not your Japanese style which is actually called ATP or ATC) and Singapore is one of them.<br>If you look in the cab carefully, you'll see two green ATO start buttons. The driver has to press both of them together to start the train. All 3 types of train are capable of ATO.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know about it. The ATO system other countries use. But Japanese systems are more reliable at times, and many lines in Japan do not use ATO as it limits the train drivers' control of the train. ATS (Automatic Train Stop) is also divided into ATS-P (Pattern), ATS-S (Stop) and ATS-Pn (Pattern new). Shinkansen bullet trains use ATO as well. More infomation we don't flood the forum, just message me using the wonderful function and I can talk more, as I am very interested in train operations too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are not really complaining but giving positive comments and making our lives and everybody's life easier. Our complains do not necessary warrant a fare increase.<br>Some companies in Singapore have been treating comments lightly. For example a publications company from where I subscribe a monthy periodical delivers it only on the day when others can find it in the newstands. Why would I want the magazine delivered when I can get it in just a few minutes walk? We pay for it to be earlier, but this does not apply to newspapers and such.<br>More money we pay definitely equals to much better service, however, we cannot be too demanding as well. We pay for the safety of our journey, although paying more for my magazine does not mean that it would arrive at my home in the same condition as when it gets out from the printing machine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Complaining might be good in a certain sense, the company is looking at this as a way to gauge their performance. If there are no complains, there would be essentially no comments. The service provider would just continue on the way it is until someone gets injured or killed.<br>If the company did not review my case, they would go on in a mindset that drivers do know what to do, and that dangerous or potentially dangerous people can go on to harass people on board the train. Until one fine day, a dangerous person beats up commuters in the train and someone gets injured. It would not be a happy ending after all.<br>Companies of all types should look into the matter. I am not saying that companies do not look into comments, but its just that they do not look deep enough. I do believe that cockcroaches have existed in buses for a long period of time, but why we can still see them after so many complains?</div>
