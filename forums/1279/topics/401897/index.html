              <p>  It is what I would consider a fact. I have seen lots of busfans on facebook and i have to say, busfans are getting younger. We now have lots of primary school students who are interested in this hobby of buses. These kids socialise online on facebook and MSN. They rely on the primary source of information like BusInfoHub.com for their fix on buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  With these young bus enthusiasts around, I believe it is time that we, as a community, should tell their parents about the hobby so that the parents are aware of what their son/daughter is indulging in is not awkward because they are not the only bus enthusiast around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  For me, I first went on this forum in 2007. Before that, I rely on BIH and SgWiki for my primary source of information. When CSS announced it's withdrawal in April that year, I red an article of the events during the last day for CSS. I see pictures of the bus enthusiasts, whom i managed to meet and interact with thanks to various outings and gatherings either public or private and I know that I was not alone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Then, I assumed that I was one of the youngest of the bus enthusiasts, at 14 years of age. How wrong was I. I was exposed to others who started the hobby from as back as they were young. I too started the hobby back in Year 1998, the heyday of SBS red-white liveries and TIB buses. I was 5 years old. I don't know any single thing about them in detail like model name or whatever. As I grew up and new buses emerged, I happily remembered the times where I had to beg my grandmom to let me board this bus because it is new. There was once I told my grandparents to skip a Strider on 168 in 2003 for a VSO that was behind it. During that period, the Volvo Super Olympians were new to SBST and i never ridden on one before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Ok, that's my story. What I'm saying is that there are still many young boys and girls out there who are interested in this hobby. So, I would suggest that we keep this forum free from trolls and conflict and make it a more comfortable place for them to gain information. Who knows? Our knowledge now can be useful for the future.</p>

              <p>i only know i remembered taking &amp; seeing Volvo B10M MK2s running on 302 &amp; 307 when i was young. NAC DDs on 307 was the most remembered. Striders on 67, VOs on 190 too. i started bus-fanning since sec 1. didnt knew most of the routes in singapore that time; only basic &amp; frequent services like 190, 985, 975, 307. then i began researching about buses in SG after frequently riding on 307. found out SGF through yahoo searchbox. i started with 'SMRT BUSES LuvER' in SGF and began knowing about the other buses in SG. after thinking again, i recalled back that i took:<br><br>- TIB674M on 975<br>- Taking a Hispano Habit on 307 right before the june holidays of 2008<br>- Taking a UD on 975<br>- DAF, Hinos, O405 Volgrens on 307 before</p>
              <p>after knowing much about buses, i decided to 'expand' my friendship with other bus fans in SGF. remembered that i met tintinspartan, Interception_7 &amp; TIB1051D @ CCK Interchange after alighting from 172. then met with jayh272416 (also @ cck interchange) , made friends with ama-teur during the LTG tour and other bus fans during the DAF tour. recently met Volvo Olympian while on 853 OC and it was great! i hope to make more friends in the future (:</p>

              <p>Started when I was young, 3-4 years old. I always love to take double decker buses. There was once when my dad and I visited my grandpa in the hospital. After visiting, my dad asked me if I want to take a long bus(Bendy bus) or a Double Decker. I answered the long bus as I had never ever take it before! </p>
              <p>I still remembered my first ride on SMRT bus, which was 67. At that time, it was a Hispano OAC. I was sad then. But my dad when to ask if there is any long bus on 67. The BC replied yes. After weeks, I manage to catch a Square Box Bendy on 67, with the same BC! I was so happy at that time. </p>
              <p>Then, whenever I go, especially bus interchange, my mother would take picture of me and the bus together. Still remember the first picture was @ a Double Decker(side) on 51, with a ad(daisy HI-LO - Only 1% Low Fat High Calcium with Vitamin D...) </p>
              <p>I also took pictures of buses in WRI. All square box bendy! 1 on 856(with Cold Storage - Closer to you) rear ad &amp; Square box bendy on 903. My mom also made a paper bendy bus with cardboard, toilet roll etc.</p>
              <p>In 1999, I took picture of MRT. 1 from YCK station(of me and a train approaching) and 3 from my grandma house. I even took the LRT train and have a enjoyable trip on it.</p>
              <p>In 2001, Hispano Bendy started to ply on 911. At that time, I still love to take Bendy bus. I also manage to ride it and even took picture of it. Time passes, Volgren rigid on 911 was also my favourite and I took TIB964B once on 911. </p>
              <p>The best was my F1rst dream came true, A B9TL on 161. Before B9TL came to 161, VSO on 161/168 are common. I took the VSO on both the service before, and both do have the smell of the fuel. When I took 168 to bedok, I manage to spot the SBS Transit Bendy bus. Back to the topic, my first B9TL ride was on 143, where I was so happy and surprise of the look. I always hope that it would cameo on 161. </p>
              <p>During the CNY, while I was going to Sengkang, instead of taking the long ride of 965, I took svc. 161. And I was lucky. A B9TL appeared infront of me, heading to the bus park. At the bus park, the only 161 bus was the B9TL. And I manage to take it! </p>
              <p>Volgren on 911 also attracted me. Last time, TIB1188T &amp; TIB1139K was the famous bus I have known. For TIB1188T slot, it sometimes replaced my TIB1190K, TIB1193C and TIB1191H. The air-con was super cold and I enjoyed it. During my Pri Sch day, I also surprise to see 2 Volgren Bendy(TIB1178Y/TIB1188T) did on 911 and appeared at the same spot. </p>

              <p>I still remembered the very first rego I remembered ........ TIB811J</p>
              <p>and that was when 2003</p>
              <p>For some reason , this is the only rego i can remember from then to now,I still remembered I tried to remember the rego of a Lance and a MK2 bendy.</p>
              <p>That TIB811J inspired me to actually wonder whether there were more regos in the bus fleet. At that time, I dont have a computer so I could only continue thinking until Sep 2009 when I discovered SgForums and SgWiki.From then on,I because a full-time bus fan.  </p>

              <p>Since Primary 4 I think. Precisely, I started to collect all of the bus guides in whole Singapore by searching through Bus interchange. If can't get it at there, I could ask counter for the bus guide (if they are put inside the information board) If I still cannot get there, I will wait for the bus service which I never get before, asked BC permission whether can go in the bus and get the free bus guide.</p>

              <p>Let me openly suggest that it's advisable to include some younger bus enthusiasts. Let them have a chance of the spotlight. It's not that i'm biased or watever, it's just that it's time for the more younger bus enthusiasts to have a piece of the action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you're writing a story, I would suggest interviewing those who are more senior in the hobby, teens in this hobby and of course, the primary school kids. Again, this hobby of buses as i mentioned again is attracting a much more younger audience now.</p>

              running on 302 &amp; 307 when i was young. NAC DDs on 307 was the
              most remembered. Striders on 67, VOs on 190 too. i started
              bus-fanning since sec 1. didnt knew most of the routes in singapore
              that time; only basic &amp; frequent services like 190, 985, 975,
              307. then i began researching about buses in SG after frequently
              riding on 307. found out SGF through yahoo searchbox. i started
              with 'SMRT BUSES LuvER' in SGF and began knowing about the other
              buses in SG. after thinking again, i recalled back that i
              took:<br> <br> - TIB674M on 975<br> - Taking a Hispano Habit on 307 right before the june holidays of
              2008<br> - Taking a UD on 975<br> - DAF, Hinos, O405 Volgrens on 307 before</p>
              <p>after knowing much about buses, i decided to 'expand' my
              friendship with other bus fans in SGF. remembered that i met
              tintinspartan, Interception_7 &amp; TIB1051D @ CCK Interchange
              after alighting from 172. then met with jayh272416 (also @ cck
              interchange) , made friends with ama-teur during the LTG tour and
              other bus fans during the DAF tour. recently met Volvo Olympian
              while on 853 OC and it was great! i hope to make more friends in
              the future (:</p>
