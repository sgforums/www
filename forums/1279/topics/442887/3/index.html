              <p>Transport operator SBS Transit will be making changes to bus services 43 and 48.</p>
              
              <p>To meet the needs of Punggol residents, service 43 will call at two new bus stops - located opposite each other - along Punggol way outside Soo Teck LRT Station, from Saturday, Dec 17.</p>
              
              <p>Bus service 48 will ply between Bedok North Depot and Buona Vista Terminal, and stop at nine more pairs of bus stops along the changed route from Sunday, Dec 11.</p>
              
              <p>Service 48 will now run along Bedok North Avenue 4, Upper Changi Road, Bedok Road, New Upper Changi Road and Bedok South Avenue 3, and make access to Tanah Merah MRT station quicker for residents.</p>

              <p>give 81 some buses like MK4 since they no intention to WAB
              it.</p>
              <p>As a follow up, i saw SBS8169X on 33 today deduce is sent to
              BNDEP. Either way, this might be a headstart of AMDEP "donation" of
              Scanias to accomodate BNDEP's new demand such as 48's shift in
              control which most likely will bbe effected or to reinforce WAB
              demand across the depot since WSD is running low in no.
              there. </p>

              <p>Yeaps, you're right man. 81 is just waiting for Wrights, it's plain obvious, but too bad the VO3x are not all adless, and I don't think the 81's SL wants to give up the 3 VSOs too.</p>
              <p>And yeah, 8169X 8248B 5039H have all crossed over to BNDEP from AMDEP. The weird thing is, none of these KUBs are from the AM SP fleet. Hmm. Too lousy to give out or AM wants to keep all the good ones in? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>And if anyone did realise, 5006C is usually a SP for 36. For most of the weekdays it is on cameo, more often than not, it does 36 twice a week. Although it still goes around elsewhere to cameo on other days. So good call on AM to finally give some KUBs to BN, it took abit longer than expected. Might have 1 or 2 more KUBs flying over, but if there's none, i think BN should do just fine with 3 KUB SPs compared with just 5006C for the past week.</p>

              <p>Withdrawing a service is the hardest. Even skipping certain bus stops require justification and talking to the grassroots, that's why it can take so long. Going by the looks, the extension to KRT is dead. That part of the proposal likely would have lapsed if not it would be have been extended to KRT together.</p>
