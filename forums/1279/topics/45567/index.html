You have to read the other 2 service amendments, namely 31 &amp; 198, to understand how the route of service 196 is amended.<br><br>1) SBST 198, currently plying Boon Lay to Bt Merah, will be extended to become Boon Lay to Marina Ctre.<br><br>route from Boon Lay to AYE (Clementi Rd) will be unchanged, after that via Dover Rd, then continue with present 198 route to Jln Bt Merah, after that via Kampong Bahru Rd, Cantonment Rd, Anson Rd, Robinson Rd, Collyer Quay, Esplanade Dr &amp; Raffles Blvd.<br><br>2) SBST 31, currently plying Toa payoh to Tampines, will be shortened to become Toa Payoh to Siglap Rd (loop).<br><br>3) SBST 196, currently plying Bedok to Clementi, will be amended to become Tampines to Bt Merah.<br><br>route from Tampines to Bedok South Rd/Marine Parade will be the same as present 31, after that, the route will be the same as present 196 to Shenton Way, then via Keppel Rd, Telok Blangah Rd &amp; Henderson Rd.<br></div>

I do not expect fully that my suggestion be implemented. The final decision lies in the hands of the bus companies, not me.<br><br>What make you think that my suggestions will result in the companies to have smaller profit margin, fare increase and high turnover? How do you know the resuIt will turn out this way since it hasn't become a reality? I would like to know more.<br><br>I have taken buses of service 23 before, yes, I know, this service has a high demand, that's why superbuses are used. But the only change is that the service does not serve the only stop along Rochor Canal Rd. From my observation, mostly those who alight/board at Rochor Canal Rd are going to/from Sim Lim Square. With the service change, they can either alight along Jln Besar outside Sim Lim Tower or along Bencoolen St, Sim Lim Square is just a walking distance away. It's only cause a small inconvenience, that all. Also, Selegie Rd is within walking distance if they are boarding the service towards Tampines. Take a look at service 56 for example, those going to Sim Lim Square alight at Sungei Road or Bencoolen St, but they still have to walk to Selegie Rd for the return journey right?<br><br>I believe that the new service 68 is possible-to-be-implemented service, which maintain the link of service 23 from Tampines Interchange to Jln Besar and the link of service 97 from Jurong East Interchange to Serangoon Rd.<br><br>As for those people who insist to take service 23 instead of walking from Jln Besar to Serangoon Rd, you are just very lazy, you are just like another lazy group of people who take service 36 from Orchard Boulevard to Orchard Rd just because they felt that the 5 minutes walk take an eternity.<br></div>

Of course, you people don't mind taking buses for short distance and transfer, because I believe you people are paying concession fares.<br><br>In that case, 9819Y can transfer to services 66 or 67 and cross the road. Troblesome? Or prefer to save a little bit of inconvenience and alight outside Tekka Centre?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me give you MY Personal point of view. I feel that Svc 23 shouldn't be extended as it is rather a fast service to SIm Lim Square. Also, if this service is being compared with Service 67, your travelling time would be added by at least 50%!!! Also, Service 23 does provide a good link from Little India to Tampines via the expressway. I can always see lotsa Indians taking Service 23, especially Sunday.<br><br>Tranquilice, let me tell you this: People have their own way of travelling from place to place. Sometimes, they dun think of any factors in mind as they might need to get to their destinations w/in the quickest time as possible. I hope that u could think thru of wat i've said here.</div>
