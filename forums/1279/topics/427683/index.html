              <p>anyone noticed frequent overcrowding on Premium routes? Overcrowding for premium routes mean standing passengers, because they are supposed to be guarentted a seat in exchange for paying a premium fare. The bus signboard in front also says so.</p>
              <p>As I'm staying in Serangoon area, I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">often</span> see passengers already standing onboard sv 599 when the bus turns into S'goon Nth Ave 4 bus-stop. Even more passengers are standing when its turning into AMK Ave 3! I think LTA should downgrade these svcs into Express svcs instead. They don't deserve to charge premium fares.</p>

              <p>I take 554 on a daily basis to work (the 8a.m <em>abfahrt aus</em> The Premiere@Tampines stop).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since they had the second trip (I have absolutely no idea why the heck the second trip is 20 min earlier leaving the last stop in Tampines around 7:40a.m which reaches the CBD at such an ungodly time, given that the 8a.m bus <em>departé</em> reaches CBD by 8:40a.m), the overcrowding stopped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, I don't understand the rationale of not standing on Premium routes. While that would understandably make it non-Premium anymore, a lot of people really depend on the Premium service to get to work on time. I kid you not, but in some cases in the heartlands, it could very well be faster taking the bus than the train (and the train during peak hours nowadays is really nothing to talk about).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no qualms about paying $3.60 and still standing, but hey, I would manage to get on the bus and not have to get my rather plump body squished like a pancake by the time I reach Raffles Place... I guess no matter what, even if there are people standing, it would definitely be less squeezy than a train.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I think the 554 timings need to be changed. If the 8a.m <em>abfahrt aus</em> The Premiere@Tampines reaches the CBD by 8:40a.m, they should push the timings <em>aus</em> Tampines for both 554 buses by 10 minutes. I kid you not, the trains are simply not the way to go in Singapore. They can't get their act together and commuters suffer. Kudos to the fact that SBS Transit Limited, and to a lesser extent, SMRT, realizes the profits that can come from Premium routes which generates good profits. This inherently would be good for shareholders, which I don't know if you people are...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really hope the authorities can allow standees on the buses. It really is a win-win situation, both pax get to board and not get late, and the company (and indirectly, shareholders) also gets better financial returns.</p>

              <p>Premium I think the idea came from Hong Kong somewhat, those private buses.</p>

              <p><br>Scheme B svs dates back long ago.</p>
              <p>If I did remember it started that SBS let them operate as supplementary buses during peak hours. I remembered Sv 157 was one of them.</p>
              <p>Good for SBS as well, lesser pressure to purchase more buses on top of its 3400 fleet in 1980s.</p>

              <p>As long as the overcrowding is not so obvious, should be ok for a few passengers to stand, rather than let them miss the last and probably the only bus trip.</p>
              <p>But some Premium Bus services need more improvements and possibly re route, like 555.</p>

              <p>As long as the overcrowding is not so obvious, should be ok for a few passengers to stand, rather than let them miss the last and probably the only bus trip.</p>

              If I'm not wrong, Premium svcs are designed to cater to pax who are willing to pay more for a faster and direct journey and yet be able to get a seat. The creation of Premium svcs is also aimed to encourage more car owners give up driving to work and use public transport instead. Otherwise, if still got to stand, can we still persuade more car owners to give up their luxury for public transport? Its already difficult to simply persuade these people to use public transport.
              
              I agree that it doesn't make sense to strictly stop Premium pax from boarding once all the seats are filled. But if it happens too often or even serious, then something is wrong.
              Alternatively, such overcrowded Premium svcs should be downgraded to Express svcs instead. Express svcs can still provide the same service as Premium svcs, except it costs lower than Premium but able to accept standing pax.
