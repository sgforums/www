              <p>Okay. Here is the reason why I am angry.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I was going out. I was going to take the bus 165. When i stepped out of house walking to the bus stop. I saw the bus 165 coming. As i was injured at my thigh. I couldnt run much. But I tried my best to reach the bus stop earlier. The Bus got ahead of me. I saw some people standing up waiting for the bus to arrive. So i slowed down so as to not further strain the injury. Before i reached the entrance into the bus, the bus closed its door and began moving. So i ran up to it quickly. I saw it was a lady driver. i caught up and knocked the door . <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The lady driver looked at me and continued driving</span></strong>. WHAT KIND OF ATTITUDE IS THIS? The Bus was apparently still in the BUS BAY! She didnt stop for me!</p>

                  you should really consider obtaining the time you have attempted to board the bus (since you don't have the rego) and email to CorpComms. because we are in no position to answer to your query and we are not a forum for complains.</p>

              <p>cut and paste from the FAQ section from <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg">www.sbstransit.com.sg</a></p>
              <p><strong>Sometimes, Bus Captains refuse to open the door for me despite seeing me trying to catch the bus. Why?<br></strong><span class="bodytxt">All our Bus Captains are required to stop for passengers to board the bus before moving off if they can see the commuters approaching the bus and the bus is still in the bus stop bay. However, if the bus is partially out of the bus stop bay even though it is still within the bus lane, the Bus Captains have been advised not to stop for alighting or boarding activities for safety reasons. </span></p>
              <p class="bodytxt">Also, our Bus Captains have to concentrate on looking at their right so as to exit from the bus bay and hence may not be able to see passengers running towards the bus from the left or from the rear. For the safety of our passengers, we do not encourage our passengers to run after the bus, they should wait for the next bus to arrive.<br></p>

              <p>there was once i experienced this.</p>
              <p>i was on SBS593G on 119, the BC was Lim Kuan Tat.</p>
              <p>upon stopping at the bus stop opp. north vista sec, travelling on the sengkang int direction, he alighted and boarded a few pax.</p>
              <p>a group of north vista students saw the bus from a distance away, and started running towards the bus. when nearly all the students had reached within an arm's length distance from the bus, he shut the doors and drove away, left the students cursing behind.</p>
              <p>recently i took his bus and i saw he had the blue award badge (would that be the "star" award one?)</p>
              <p>i'm wondering how BC's like him with such lousy attitude get an award.</p>
              <p>on another incident, an old lady with a folded trolley climbed up 8109U, searching for her ezlink card. he did not move the bus. i thought he would wait for the old lady to take a seat before moving off.</p>
              <p>apparently i was wrong.</p>
              <p>the moment she tapped her card, he let go of the pedal, the bus jerked hard which left the old lady fumbling for the nearest pole, and the trolley crashed to the side...</p>
              <p>given that such BC does not even have the basic compassion for an elderly passenger, how is it that he was awarded? for good service, when the service given is utterly horrendous?</p>
