              <p>Even parents get worried over the actions by "Singapore Buses" influencing bus fans to do reckless and dangerous stunts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"><br><br><img src="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/sites/default/files/public/styles/sgseen_featured_image/public/article/images/featured/2013/09/busfanmain2.jpg?itok=LAr-FKLW" alt="" width="462" height="280"><br><br><a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/a-mothers-plea-to-bus-fans-think-about-your-parents-before-you-get-killed">http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/a-mothers-plea-to-bus-fans-think-about-your-parents-before-you-get-killed</a></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The mother of a bus fan is so concerned about the safety of her child, she penned this heartfelt plea with the help of her other son.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The mother has witnessed her son dashing across a busy road just to get a photograph of a bus, and hopes bus fans can consider the feelings of their loved ones before risking their lives unnecessarily.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">STOMPer <strong>Jack</strong> helped his mother write this plea:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I would like to express my deepest disappointment at these young bus enthusiasts. My son is part of this group, and takes photos of buses as his hobby.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I have seen his passion, and I have also witnessed him endangering himself by dashing across the road in heavy traffic to the divider near Phoenix LRT to get a photograph of a new long MAN service 190 bus a few months ago during a family outing. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I did not know what was influencing his behavior. It will hurt my heart if I lose him because of his recklessness! Recently, I was shocked to have read about these bus enthusiasts who risk their lives for photos with buses. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">I work in an environment where there are many heavy vehicles passing through every day, and safety is the number one priority in my company, given the risk of injury.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I would like to have this published in STOMP and call out to these youths from the 'Singapore Buses' Facebook group/page/forum.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"They were recently featured in the news filming a bus which was apparently on fire and emitting thick smoke. They apparently compromised their safety by going near the source of the fire.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Blind spots can be everywhere, and even though buses are your hobby, as youths, you lack the maturity and experience in dealing with heavy vehicles that could injure you badly in an accident.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"It was horrifying to watch how the person who took a video of bus 138, which was said to be on fire, approached the bus and got very close to the vehicle without realizing the full extent of the dangers involved. The bus could have exploded and injured the two persons.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Did the two boys not think about the dangers of standing on a road when they posed in front of and behind buses while they were in the bus bay and on the road?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"This is why pedestrian walkways were placed at interchanges and at the Marina Centre Terminal. Roads are for cars, and walkways are for pedestrians!</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"How would the parents of the two youths react if they knew their children were endangering themselves, and that any accident that was a result of their action could have been avoided?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I believe there are safer ways to takes photos of a bus without risking your life unnecessarily.Your parents would be upset if you were been injured or killed because of your hobby.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Please consider the feelings of your loved ones."</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Written on behalf of my mother, Ms Tan, who wishes to see this published on STOMP for her son (my brother) to see his mother's appeal to him."</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">STOMPer <strong>Randy</strong> feels that action should be taken against bus fans who endanger their lives and those of innocent members of the public with their dangerous behaviour.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">This is the STOMPer's response to an article on STOMP about <a style="color: #0a69c5; font-weight: bold;" href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/a-mothers-plea-to-bus-fans-think-about-your-parents-before-you-get-killed">a heartfelt plea of a mother to her bus enthusiast son</a>, after she witnessed him dashing across a busy road just to capture a snapshot of a bus.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">The STOMPer said:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I feel that action needs to be taken against dangerous bus fans.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"I read STOMP's article about a mother's plea to her bus enthusiast son and strongly feel that something should be done to stop bus fans from endangering themselves and innocent members of the public.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Bus companies and the traffic police should outlaw such acts.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Bus fans, you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Ignoring the advice of members of the public and even defying your parents.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Putting yourselves at risk and wasting your youth over a stupid hobby.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.4em; font-size: medium; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif;">"Those responsible for running that Singapore Buses facebook/forum should be ashamed of themselves and take responsibility of shutting down the page for good to redeem themselves in society."</p>
