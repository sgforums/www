              <p>It's the other way round bro — all these while majority will actl have brains to utilise the TPE-SLE corridor to commute between the east and north... And 969 is still the most direct between Yishun and Tampines even with the 3 stops...</p>
              <p>You must be naive to think that just coz NSL is crowded it shows a lot are using MRT between east and north! Then what are the huge crowds of CBD workers residing in the north? Not to mention those Orchard Road goers where NSL is by far the only option? You think everyone in the train comes from the east? Pls use some common sense!</p>

              <p>I am referring to other east destinations and not specifically TP. I know 969 is still the best option from TP. What I am saying is that there are those from other east destinations (excluding TP, CGA &amp; PSR) who would take the MRT to get to the North. Maybe those from Bedok would otherwise choose MRT over 168. Also, I know that not everyone at Bishan come from the east, because in fact those from the Northeast (I dont say ALL) would take the MRT when they would prefer it over northbound services and others from the other side</p>

              <p>Yesterday I took 969 out from Tampines Int. Reporting here with trip timings:</p>
              <p>On the DDU: Tampines Int 2006 - new Tampines stops 07, 08, 08 - TPE stop 2022 ...</p>
              <p>Actual trip: Tampines Int 2011 - 16, 17, 19 - TPE stop 2028</p>
              <p>One person boarded at the first Tamp Concourse stop, another person alighted at the second stop. No other activity along the Tamp Ave 9 stop.</p>
              <p>After the modification, actual trip timings appeared to have increased by approx 2-3 minutes (and distance travelled reduced by 0.2 km).</p>
              <p>Shall do a few more rides and see if this is a new norm. If so I'll be leaning more towards taking 168 from Tampines if I know there's one coming soon!</p>
              <p>Side note: are the DDU scheduled timings supposed to be followed exactly or are they just a reference? Since the "after TPE" stop on Lentor Ave was scheduled at 2039 (17 minutes away, usually would take at most 10 minutes nia ...)</p>

              <p>Are you serious? NEL/CCL/NSL, and possibly more feeder buses to transfer to? Who would waste time transferring 3-5 times, when there is 39/168/858/969 from TPE bus stop, and 85 from Sengkang MRT? Those from Punggol might prefer taking 136 to after TPE bus stop and walking to the long bus stop.</p>
              <p>Pax from Hougang can take 161. If they are heading to Yishun or Sembawang, they can take 165 to AMK and take MRT. 72 to YCK might be faster, I'm not sure.</p>

              Woodlands. It's a bit more troublesome to Sembawang, as the only
              service there from TPE bus stop is 858 which cannot use DDs (which
              means full sardine packed buses and unreliable frequency).</p>

              <p>Are you serious? NEL/CCL/NSL, and possibly more feeder buses to
              transfer to? Who would waste time transferring 3-5 times, when
              there is 39/168/858/969 from TPE bus stop, and 85 from Sengkang
              MRT? Those from Punggol might prefer taking 136 to after TPE bus
              stop and walking to the long bus stop.</p>
              <p>Pax from Hougang can take 161. If they are heading to Yishun or
              Sembawang, they can take 165 to AMK and take MRT. 72 to YCK might
              be faster, I'm not sure.</p>

              965 is faster from Sengkang MRT lah dey. From Hougang can take 854 lah dey.

              <p>I think just a rough reference. <br>Observing 185's DDU aft Clementi MRT twrds Soon Lee is 1min per stop and given i think 7-8mins to travel on highway, but actual trip is 2min per stop and around 4 minutes on highway (no jam, ~60kmh), end up BC still on time. <br><br>Intrigues me why don't they put actual travel time b/w stops so it's 2mins per stop, unless the planner thinking bus can reach every stop in 1min...</p>
