              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Assuming you are indeed weiteck, why don't you ask a question
              yourself.<br> <br> Why <em>don't</em> respond to anything?<br>  No provocations, no retaliations, not retaliations, no
              retaliations again. Cycle of death. Seeing a couple of times where
              one party has requested for the attacks to stop, but indirectly
              clone accounts seen continually provoking.<strong> I observe nobody wants
              to owe up on the clone accounts and conveniently finger pointing to
              the other party for the clone to "promote his own
              page". </strong><br> <br> Both parties are at fault, finger pointing no use. But the onus
              happens to be on the the bigger party to stop, as mentioned, the
              attacks using people's medical condition and whateer life situation
              was well beyond respectable actions. <br> <br>  Most of you can just don't give a fuck about one person and
              his small group of friends as well, leave them alone. Subsequently
              they'll probably leave you alone as well. Sg95express mentioned as
              well the things all happened because of one incident.<br> <br> SBS7485P apolgised, but is it a bit too late as well? Why hadn't
              you done so earlier, or attempt to clear up certain matters so that
              there's no need for continious hate over "someone sabotaged
              someone's ricebowl out of spite", when you have admitted you did
              wrong (clarification from the said party's page, have moved on)?
              Moving on probably should also include the fact that you've caused
              damage to some innocent parties, apologies does not really cut
              it.<br> <br>  How much direct and indirect damage have you caused because
              of a "spur of the moment" anger and action over the incident? One
              influence another, become the group everybody has the same mindset.
              When people retaliate/defend you all not happy, then retaliate. End
              up 3 fucking years of chaos for everybody. If one party hadn't
              started by the spark, or one party stopped, won't it be calmer?
              What's so good about continously badmouthing or targetting each
              other's pages? I see more frequently is the clone accounts copying
              a page content and adding shit to it, that alone is provocation as
              well, regardless of who did it. <br> <br> Clear this up for the parties involved. Look at how much chaos and
              damage and scars appeared. I need not quote sg95express, the person
              knows himself as well.<br> <br> So in the first place, why hate and fight?</p>

              <p>If you know that clone behind it, why not expose him(them) here then? How come I don't see any names here? There's SMB228X, SMB388S, TIB562C, Jason Lim WD, SBS3000G, Gus.chong.e and more...even on Stomp. Aren't you good at exposing people? </p>
              <p>Is there a rule then..? Like what you've said, both parties are wrong, so I don't see a need to let either party to apologise first, if you feel that there's a need for apology, you do it first...</p>
              <p>Aren't you the one whom vent your anger by blocking people/bad mouth people and even posting pics of people acts on Stomp AND even "hire" a spy to screenshot people's post? </p>
              <p>And in the first place, is there really a need to report directly to the company? Did you even warn the person? Seek advice around? Or did you just do it because of your hates?</p>
              <p>I guess that you purposely reported the leaking of company without warning anyone because that group of people have been treating you badly, commenting on your photography skills etc. It's then from your intention that this will create a hatred from the other group where they would start badmouth you because that's what everyone does...come and prove me wrong with your evidence then, no point posting long stories, everyone go for evidence. And if you were to provide enough evidence, I don't even think this would happen...</p>

Please go and get an IT expert or any form of policing body to track. I really urge all parties to stop fighting as this is not going to do any good. As much as we have our differences, I would appreciate if everyone would learn to make peace. I may have said harsh things to the lot of you guys and all that was at the spur of the moment. We are all not a 100% angel and somewhere along the lines we mess up. I would like to publicly apologise to anyone who has ever been offended by me. And I would boldly declare that no one in Singapore Buses facebook page being an admin there. None of the admins have or would go to STOMP or sgForums and make a ruckus using clone accounts and fake names. If you have created other enemies, I cannot help you. You just have to face them yourself. Lets stop these childish chatters and move on with life</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>can all of you really stop bickering? of all things quarrel over buses. And you are males!<br><br>Still, I think its just a chapter in life. As you grow older, your interests changes, and you may outgrow certain habits/ hobbies such as buses etc. Hobbies, are meant to be some form of relief from your usual life eg. studying. Not a source of high blood pressure<br><br>So i say, really, dont take all these buses and petty quarrels too out of hand. 10, 15 years down the road, you will probably laugh at yourself and think it was silly or embarrasing of yourself to do all these things, including risking your lifes taking photos at dangerous positions etc.<br><br>Know what you are doing, know what you want</p></div>
