              <p>Well, though what I'm saying is off-topic, but the road named for a particular HDB flat can actually be changed even when operational...I won't elaborate or give examples. As to whether the flats will reflect the change in the street it belongs to, I will leave it to SBS3688Y and other senior bus fans to determine themselves.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, if this turns out to be true, then the current edgedale plains leading to the waterway (section rom Punggol drive to inside) will also have to be renamed to Punggol drive. Because not possible to change only 1 side but not the other. They are actually supposed to be edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end since they terminate there. That is why I still think it is unlikely. Anyway I go there check tomorrow! Cheers.</p>

              <p>All, I just went to check personally at the road. There is no new road sign indicating Punggol drive on this new road. So it is not Punggol drive. I took sbs 386 and asked the bus control station people. They say it is still called edgefield plains as of this moment and the bus route is still updated as edgefield plains. So we shall wait over the next few weeks for any changes. Cheers!</p>

              <p>The VLS works by GPS, which to compensate for inherent inaccuracies, registers the fare stages by detections of the bus arriving within certain radius to the bus-stop.</p>
              <p>If for some reason, the GPS is totally useless, the bus will use the odometer for dead reckoning.</p>
              <p>Systems that use GPS and dead-reckoning will never be 100% accurate. This is particularly true for buses that pass bus-stops without stopping as it may not give enough time for the VLS to figure out where it is, especially in densely built up areas like CBD, and underground areas like many interchanges now.</p>
              <p>If you want the most accurate way out, you use locationing beacons and plant them at every single bus-stop. But will you want to fork out that $$$?</p>

              <p>All, I just went to check personally at the road. There is no
              new road sign indicating Punggol drive on this new road. So it is
              not Punggol drive. I took sbs 386 and asked the bus control station
              people. They say it is still called edgefield plains as of this
              moment and the bus route is still updated as edgefield plains. So
              we shall wait over the next few weeks for any changes. Cheers!</p>

              <p>hi mr dupdup77; actually the new Punggol Dr roadsign was put up a couple of weeks ago. initially this sign was fixed parallel to this new road. Therefore i was surprised why this new road is Punggol Dr and not Edgefield Plains. but today morning i went there again and noticed it has been re-positioned to be parallel to the LRT tracks. the LTA contractor fixed wrongly initially.. cheers.</p>

              <p>Maybe you don't know... but these buses are newly introduced... hence you see their frequency is bad... in coming months, will improve... enjoy! </p>
