              <p>There used to be a bus service 578 which runs between
              Compassvale Street and Orchard/Suntec City, looping at Orchard
              Road.</p>
              <p>This service was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-12-14-01-S.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">launched in
              2007</span></a>, but was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/download/20090727_Withdrawal_of_Cityshopper_Svcs_Poster.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">withdrawn
              in 2009.</span></a></p>
              <p>The routing is as follows,</p>
              <p>Compassvale Street, Punggol Road, Sengkang East Avenue, Sengkang
              West Avenue, Fernvale Lane, Sengkang West Road, Yio Chu Kang Road,
              (CTE, Moulmein Road, Newton Road, Scotts Road), Orchard Road, Bras
              Basah Road, Temasek Boulevard, (Rochor Road, Rochor Canal Road,
              Bukit Timah Road, CTE), Yio Chu Kang Road, Sengkang West Road,
              Fernvale Lane, Sengkang West Avenue, Sengkang East Avenue, Punggol
              Road, Compassvale Street.</p>
              <p>*() denotes express sector.</p>
              <p>Undeniably, this route could have received high loading.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the service was only in operation from 10am to
              4:30pm on weekdays, and from 10am to 10pm on weekends and public
              holiday.</p>
              <p>As the operating hours were outside peak hours, the service
              missed the peak hour loading and was withdrawn just two years after
              introduction.</p>
              <p>Amidst the continual discussion on a possible bus service
              between Sengkang and the Central Business District, I feel that we
              could consider reinstating this route, to run between Compassvale
              Bus Interchange and the Central Business District.</p>
              <p>This time round, we could have the service operate during peak
              hours only.</p>
              <p>Also to note is the bus fare, which was $3.60 for adults and $1
              for children.</p>
              <p>If we could charge the same distance fares as city direct bus
              services (around $2.40), and operate the service during peak hours
              only, I believe this service would be well-received by the people
              living in Sengkang.</p>
              </div>

              <p>In fact, i agree. There are a handful number of such "speical services" that could be adjusted so that they can receive good loading. For the following eg, it could be withdrawn becoz of the operating hours, fare, frequency, and maybe how built up the area was, as mentioned by gekpohboy. Now that Sengkang area is more developed, I think such as service could be well received, if it operates like Express buses.</p>
              <p>Currently, there are also some of these special services that could be adjusted, such as CT8. I recall a ride on that service a few weeks ago on a weekend evening. Many ppl boarded the bus and there were many standees frm Chinatown to amk. Considering that this is a popular service with the elderly, i think that improving the freq can make things better and then most of them can have a seat.</p>
              <p>Off topic: how is CT18's loading so far been?</p>

              <p>They slow down because of the track intersection la LMAO.. not coz got DTL below or whatever..</p>
              <p>And they slow down coz distance fobids a train from accelerating too much.. anyway how fast would one even expect a train to travel in a tunnel that only stretches 600m.. this is an MRT train not a BMW, the acceleration is far slower..</p>

              <p>There is need for Yishun feeders to be restructured due to legacy routes before development of ring road and other developments such as malls, hospitals, hawker centers and introduction of 117, 803, 805, 807, 860 and extension of 103. </p>
