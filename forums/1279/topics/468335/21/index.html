              SMRT trolling with commuter feedback on fb page. Got to see this. The person who feedback thought 302 was operated by SBST or so, so he wrote dear sbs, and SMRT knew that 302 is operated by them but they even said to check SBS website to complain.
              SMRT srsly is trolling with the commuter's feedback.

              <p>In the O405 Driver Dashboard (maybe other buses oso have), there is a speedometer with other guages right? Look at the speedometer, there's the speed numbers. Look below the speed numbers. It shows KM. Below there there's a counter like thing. That counter shows how many KMs it has travelled. I dunno if that counter is resettable. If it isn't, then that's the number of KMs the bus has travelled since manufacture.</p>

              <p>Ive had enough of everyones nonsense. Id like to publicly declare all Singapore Buses facebook page admins have never used any clone accounts on sgForums to create any form of chaos.

As much as we have our differences, I would appreciate if everyone would learn to make peace. I may have said harsh things to the lot of you guys and all that was at the spur of the moment. We are all not a 100% angel and somewhere along the lines we mess up. I would like to publicly apologise to anyone who has ever been offended by me. And I would boldly declare that no one in Singapore Buses facebook page being an admin there. None of the admins have or would go to STOMP or sgForums and make a ruckus using clone accounts and fake names. If you have created other enemies, I cannot help you. You just have to face them yourself. Lets stop these childish chatters and move on with life</p>

              <p>SBS7485P, why is the apology <em>only</em> now and not much much earlier to the lot of the guys who were affected? It's apparently 3 years from what i gathered off the investigating. 3 years to realise that what you've done indirectly harmed the hobby and people whom were affected? You indirectly created enemies for one party in the past with your spur of the moment actins and now you wash your hands off? <br><br>Boycotting due to phtoography of buses. Whether true or not, i don't care but whoever who's intiating boycotts is pretty much chidlish to the core. Stupidly throwing them aside instead of respecting each and every photographer's unique abilities, forcing everybody to follow one fucking "standard". Later people became more successful in photos then realise you screwed up.<br><br>Both parties are at fault. At the spur of the moment. Harsh things. By finger pointing at one party, then badmouthing and causing the intial chaos because of defensive actions after the incident? Not to mention, your party did wrong, not respecting the company and degrading the hobby with that kind of usage. Why was the blame and claim of sabotage even exist? Then people hate that one party because of the belief he sabotaged the hobby, this already formed the basis of the hate that you are indirectly responsible for, SBS7485P.<br><br>All things have a chain effect. One party attack, the other party defend. Then the bigger party not happy still, brainwash people to boycott and dislike the smaller party, slowly eroding the support and friends away so as a way to gain back the support? Then slowly become a war.<br><br>Not to mention slowly a biasedness grow out and then causing more chaos because of the intial chaos. Honestly, I didn't see the point why people target here and there. Then create more conflicts.Then people get divided into more camps and from what i see, the person who was targetted actually lost his friends becaue of the "spur of the moment" actions.<br><br>And what is with those clone accounts happening that kept copying that party's facebook page content and posting it with nonsenical claim? Then later start to victimise that party's page and then later start to target his friends around him? What the fuck for?<br><br>Was these hate and anger even necessary? Was there benefit to attack and badmouth? Was retaliation neccessary? Wasn't it better to leave the party alone and do your own fucking things in the first place? End up today everybody hate, target and anger, and create all these bullshit. For what fuck?<br><br>I gathered that the party is seeing a doctor as well, and I do not see the point as well why people want to bring up his medical and life situation and badmouth as well, repeatedly. There's a limit to bullying as well, and i agree with many others, it has crossed the line. Not surprised why the other party retaliated as well. Even you don't respect people, respect the medical and life situation, STUPID, by leaving it out of the politics! <br><br><br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">All of you who had participated have to make amends and work things out each other.
