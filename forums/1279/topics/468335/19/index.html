              <p>even many non bus fans are saying that you all are doing something dangerous by risking safety standing in front and behind of buses, the members of the public are very concerned about this group of facebook.com/sgbus Singaore Buses enthusiasts <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. no proof no talk, public has been aware of how bus enthusiasts risked their lives running about marina centre terminal dangerously and videoing a bus up close. Always see one group of kids targetting one person for everything, blatant attacks everywhere. Being the bigger group doesn't mean you all can play god ignore safety rules<br><br>And i'm not Mark Chua <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">, yet i got your name through sgforums as well <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
