              <p>just because you have the most likes of a bus page on facebook, everybody has to listen to you? just because you are different, you have to brainwash the rest to follow you? i was on your side once then i realised that you are nothing but a liar and loves twisting the truth. you love defaming people publicly, it has happened many times even on your facebook page. you are hungry for attention and keep giving reasons that you are emotionally scarred from your father's passing which is more than 10 years ago, and yet you do nothing to make the situation better. BIS started out with good intentions at first, but with fame comes greed. you loves spreading hogwash, like someone cheating in exam when he accidentally forget to throw what is obviously trash. you are the one who spreaded hate about members of a "SPT forum". you are also one hypocrite. you keep saying SPT chases cameos like nobody's business, and yet you're the one who keeps chasing cameos now because you have too much free time.</p>
              <p>you set a very bad example for the "juniors". you are already an adult and you still have no stable job, and yet you still feel comfortable with it. i wonder if you ever feel embarrassed, because most people would feel embarrassed that they have no stable full-time job at the age of 25, unless you're a homemaker if you're married.</p>
