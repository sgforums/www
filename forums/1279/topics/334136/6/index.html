              <p>No more 3N in Bukit Panjang.<br> 3N sticker covered up by red sticker.<br> But weird thing is the SBST Plate still remains intact.<br> Maybe a new SBST service coming soon that's why they did not
                  remove?<br> 2 other bus stop remains the same. No SBST service but with plate
                  up on the pole.<br> <br> In Bukit Batok Central, 3N stickers replace 8N stickers.<br> BBDC bus stop, however, does not have the plate up on the pole.</p>

              <p><strong>Two Nite Owls put to sleep</strong></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Even though ridership has doubled within a year, the night-bus scene is set for a shake-up from Friday. 
              <br> <br> SBS Transit will be withdrawing two night bus services, 7N and 8N,
              which run from the city to Pasir Ris and Jurong West respectively. The
              operator’s four remaining Nite Owl services will see amendments to
              their routes. <br> <br> Fares will also go up: From S$2.50 and S$3 by Ez-link and cash,
              respectively, to a flat S$4 for travel between HDB towns. The S$1.50
              fare for travelling within an HDB town remains unchanged. Operating
              hours will also be reduced to just two hours, between midnight and 2am,
              instead of midnight to 4am. Night buses operate on Fridays, Saturdays
              and the eve of public holidays. <br> <br> The Public Transport Council (PTC) has approved the route and fare
              changes. When asked about the rationale for these changes, SBS Transit
              spokeswoman Tammy Tan said: “There has been an increase in costs
              experienced on all fronts. For instance, the GST increase to 7 per cent
              - which we have been absorbing since the tax was introduced - and this
              has cost us more than S$240 million to date. Staff cost has also gone
              up. And we have started buying new buses to replace the older ones.
              <br> <br> “The change in the Nite Owl operating hours is to cater to changing demands.” 
              <br> <br>SBS Transit had said earlier this year that the Nite Owl Services
              “are increasingly popular with commuters and ridership is rising every
              month”. Ridership also doubled from about a year ago, to about 1,000
              each night, added the operator.
              <br> <br>The other night bus operator, SMRT, has seven NiteRider services
              which run from 11.30pm to 4.30am on Fridays, Saturdays and eve of
              public holidays. In May, SMRT increased fares on the seven services by
              50 cents to S$3.50. The fare adjustment was due to increased operating
              costs, an SMRT spokesperson said then.
              <br> <br>While SBS Transit cuts the two services to the two corners of the
              island, commuters still have the option of two SMRT NiteRider services
              which run from the city to Pasir Ris and Jurong West. <br> <br> Night buses are classified by the PTC as “Basic-Bus Plus services”.
              However, as they run outside non-operational hours of basic bus
              services, private bus operators can apply to run such services, said
              the PTC.
              <br> <br>Private bus operators, however, are not too keen to offer night
              services. Bus Hub, which runs two premium bus services, cited a
              shortage of drivers. “With better staffing in the future, we will
              explore running night buses,” said director V Anilan. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/ra </span></p>

              <p>No more 3N in Bukit Panjang.<br> 3N sticker covered up by red sticker.<br> But weird thing is the SBST Plate still remains intact.<br> Maybe a new SBST service coming soon that's why they did not
              remove?<br> 2 other bus stop remains the same. No SBST service but with plate
              up on the pole.<br> <br> In Bukit Batok Central, 3N stickers replace 8N stickers.<br> BBDC bus stop, however, does not have the plate up on the pole.</p>

              <p>maybe some of the bus fans here can be reporter. :) . then will see very detailed reports, such as buses used, bus rego etc etc.</p>
              <p>also, if based on what SBST have said, around 1000pax took the night rider each night, that mean revenue (excluding cost) is only around S$3000/night.  based on 8 services, average is only S$375/service. then divide by around 10 trips , average is around S$37.50/trip, and this have to cover the cost of diesel to and fro town , plus the BC salary. is it profitable?</p>
