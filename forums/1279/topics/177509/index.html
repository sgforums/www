            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">TIB515P this morning</span></strong><br><br>At around 8.30am, a mystery man reportedly boarded TIBS (SMRT) Sv 190 after the bus leaves CCK Interchange. He was carrying two paper bags with a suspicious item. Later on, he leaves two bags near the back of the bus and immediately proceeds to alight at the third stop.<br><br>There was a 'bursting' sound, after which, white fumes pour out of bag. Before the man can get off from the bus, one of the bags starts to emit dense white fumes. The fumes permeate the bus, causing passengers to panic and choke, due to inhalation of such substances. Later on, he was disappeared and the next bus arrived 5 minutes later.<br><br>Within 10 minutes, SCDF and police arrived at the scene to investigate the matter. The SCDF Hazmat unit boarded the bus to remove and check the suspicious package for traces of chemical and biologial agents. The police soon cordoned off the area, waving away curious onlookers.<br><br>THE BUS DRIVER looked shaken by the incident, stopped the bus immediately when one passenger alerted the bus driver about the smoke. He was driving for 6 years.<br><br>Some passer-bys thought that there is a bus breakdown, but obviously not. One passenger told the bus drivers what happened just now but the bus driver told him that there is smoke in the bus. The people getting off looks scared.<br><br>The TNP team learnt that the package contain some kind of chemicals, which has to require internal investigations.<br><br>It was believed that the package contains TEAR GAS, also known as pepper gas, is used by the army for training. The gas stings the eyes and nasal passages and irritates the skin. It is banned in Singapore.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quote from TNP.</span></div>

He carried two shopping bags.<br><br>The man quickly moved to the back of the bus and left at least one of his packages there.<br><br>Passengers on board said he then walked to the door, apparently to get off.<br><br>But before the bus could come to a stop, there was a soft thud - the sound of something bursting in the bag.<br><br>Seconds later, white smoke began to billow out.<br><br>Grace, 35, did not hear the soft thud. But before she realised, she found herself engulfed in smoke.<br><br>The fumes quickly filled the air-conditioned bus.<br><br>The bus driver stopped the bus at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4 and opened the doors, releasing billowing white fumes into the morning air.<br><br>He shouted for the passengers to get out. The first to leave, said the passengers, was the man who left the bag behind.<br><br>Grace struggled to breathe. She could hardly see anything because of the smoke.<br><br>She said: 'I felt choked. My nose was running.<br><br>'The smoke stung my eyes, and I had tears. It was like cutting onions, but much much worse.'<br><br>The other passengers were also red-eyed and teary. All of them were coughing, including the bus driver.<br><br>Added Grace: 'The smoke hit me first, then I heard passengers shouting to the bus driver about the smoke.<br><br>'We had stopped at a traffic junction so the driver immediately opened the doors and told all passengers to get off.'<br><br>Most of the passengers were in office attire. But there were also a few school children in uniform.<br><br>Grace was stunned.<br><br>'I panicked at first. I didn't know what happened, I just got off like the others.<br><br>'Only when I was out did I pick up pieces of info from the excited conversation around me,' she said.<br><br>She said another female passenger, in her 20s, had told her that she had seen a medium-built man in his 30s boarding the bus at the second stop.<br><br>She said the woman told her the man tried to get off at the third stop.<br><br>'But before he could, the smoke was coming out already,' she said.<br><br>'I didn't hear anything as I was listening to my radio, but the other passengers said there was a soft thud before the smoke came out.'<br><br>The man, who looked Chinese, was wearing a brown polo T-shirt and sunglasses.<br><br>He is believed to have been the first to get off the bus when the doors opened.<br><br>Everything happened so fast that no one went after him.<br><br>Grace said: 'He disappeared and couldn't be found. Another bus came to pick us up within five minutes.<br><br>'But no one told us whether we had been exposed to some chemical that could affect us later.'<br><br>Within 10 minutes, police patrol cars and fire engines rushed to the scene.<br><br>A team from the hazardous material (Hazmat) unit of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) boarded the bus in special suits and checked for traces of chemicals and biological agents.<br><br>They gave the all-clear after checking the suspicious package and placing it in a plastic bin with a tight seal.<br><br>The police cordoned off the area, waving away curious onlookers.<br><br><strong>MYSTERY MAN LEAVES BAGS ON BUS </strong><br>A man reportedly boards service 190 shortly after it leaves Choa Chu Kang interchange.

Don't run' </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">By Desmond Ng<br>TNP, 9 February 2006 </span><br><br>YOU'RE on a bus. Suddenly, fumes start billowing out from an abandoned container hidden under a seat.<br><br>The worst case scenario: a bomb or chemical agent.<br><br>What would you do?<br><br>Most people will simply panic and run, said freelance security and explosives consultant Joe Moreira.<br><br>And that's not a good idea.<br><br>Mr Moreira, 50, gave the following pointers:<br><br>1. Don't panic. Get out of the bus as soon as it stops.<br><br>2. Walk out of the bus, don't run. If it's very smoky, go on your knees and crawl.<br><br>3. Don't push those in front of you. If someone falls, the exit will be blocked and this will cause a bottleneck.<br><br>4. Don't shout or scream as this will cause others to panic and start running.<br><br>5. Ideally, avoid taking deep breaths and cover your nostrils in case the substance is a chemical agent.<br><br>6. Once you are out of the bus, move at least 30m to 50m away.<br><br>7. Hide behind something strong, like a concrete wall, which can shield you from any explosion.<br><br>Once you are safe, leave the scene if you can, advised Mr Moreira.<br><br>He added: 'But if you're not feeling well and start feeling giddy or nauseous, tell someone about it and don't try to solve the problem on your own.<br><br>'Some of these chemical agents may have a subtle effect and knock you out later.'<br><br><a href="http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,101711,00.html" rel="nofollow">TNP - EXCLUSIVE CHOA CHU KANG BUS SCARE</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>YES, i'll speculate it to be so !!!!<br><br>I'm NOT surprised if it's so as it could be some top-secret exercise done to gauge public reactions as well as the capabilities &amp; performance of the various agencies here in dealing with such situations. It may even be because of some political elections coming soon &amp; they want to do some such 'real' simulation of terrorist threats which they have been talking about in recent years, so as hopefully to 'wake' the electorate up &amp; vote for them to 'maximise' security etc.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">so is this anti-terrorist exercise or wat?</div></blockquote></div>
