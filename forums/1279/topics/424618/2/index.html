              <p>971E is just another number that LTA and SMRT to number as they cannot use 190 or 700 or 970 to add in the E. 971E is the hybrid of these 3 services. Put an E on either one of the services makes commuters more confused, since for example 190E dosen't stop at New Bridge Rd, but in Shenton Way instead. And so on.</p>
              <p>Most likely this 971E is just another temporary service that will be withdrawn once DTL is up, or else it might spawn 971 through the merging of 190, 970 and 700 and withdraw the 3 services once DTL is up.</p>

              <p><br>Loading time may not necessary be faster if the driver forgots the 3rd door sometimes. It also delays the loading time of the buses behind since the can't allow commuters access the bus as they are out of the bus bay because the bendy bus hog the whole bus bay and it gets extremely frustrating especially if the commuter is asking for directions, spoilt EZ link card readers, breakdown, etc. The delay for the buses will even be longer.</p>

              <p>just a fact:</p>
              <p>Bendies take more space, but loading time is shorter than DDs.</p>

              <p><br>thing is, 3 buses could do alight at the same time vs 2 bendies (Even the 2nd bendy can't even allow boarding at places like Pending Rd).</p>
              <p>Somemore try using SMRT bendies at NUS or NTU. Next thing behind massive traffic jam. Then SMRT smokescreen tell ppl 'traffic jam'.</p>
              <p>So much for faster loading/ unloading time <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I still stand bendy buses are mostly useless to be used in Singapore. Need to build special int for them (incurring cost) and some places like Pending will see localised congestion.</p>

              <p><br>eh.. only bus hubs, not everyone. Furthermore places like Pending is constraint due to side roads.</p>
