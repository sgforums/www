              <p>While hybrids are generally termed to be environmentally friendly due to its lower fuel consumption, its quite important to compare the fuel consumption of each model on a particular route. That's because if the fuel savings does not overcome the cost in replacement of batteries, then its not really environmentally friendly anymore as the batteries do require rare minerals to produce (lithium).</p>
              <p>Also, Parallel hybrids (both the Sunlong and Zhongtong are parallel hybrids) are generally more useful (save more fuel) on routes that do not have much start and stop operations as the fuel savings is brought about by the use of a lesser powerful engine and some electric motor assist while moving off. This is probably why sbst decided to put the hybrids on 502 instead.</p>
              <p>Series hybrid (none at the moment) are more useful in start stop environment because they have a small diesel engine that basically always runs at peak efficiency to charge the batteries. The batteries are then used to drive the electric motors. The fuel savings are brought about by the use of a small engine which is always running at peak efficiency.</p>
              <p>So i feel that before they buy a fleet of environmentally friendly hybrid bus fleet, its important to consider how much fuel savings they can yield from using the hybrids, and also consider to trial a series hybrid before any decision is made.</p>

              How about considering using biodiesel and CNG for some buses?
                  
               For CNG buses, our PTOs can also consider setting up CNG refuelling stations inside the bus depots and can also double-up to serve their CNG taxis and earn extra income?
                      
              For biodiesel, our PTOs can also consider setting up a division to collect used cooking oils from foodcourts, SFI, hawker centres etc and setting up small refinery to process them into biodiesel and use or even sell.
                      
              There's a recent newspaper article about biodiesel in Singapore and it even mentioned Bedok Transport is using biodiesel for its buses.

              <p>For CNG, the comments i can make is that its not really cost efficient for the two bus operator to use it, thats because diesel to them is relatively cheap still at about 80cents. CNG on the otherhand, will barely be able to beat this price. However, on the private sector side, things are alittle different because the diesel is priced much higher. In that case, CNG can become more price competitive than diesel, which is why taxis and some cars have converted to use CNG.</p>
              <p>As for biodiesel, its a positive path as its generated from waste (relatively renewable), but when scaling to sbst + smrt's fleet of 3000 over (which each bus can take ~300l of diesel), the quantity of biodiesel that can be generated comes into question. The fuel efficiency of a blend of biodiesel+diesel is also not as high as what diesel can offer.</p>

              <p>Thats not exactly true, some examples in the states (such as seattle which had a large hybrid fleet since 2007, with at least 500 now) do make use of hybrid fleets. It does hold true to the promise of fuel efficiency and save on diesel costs, but its hard to recover the additional cost of vehicle itself. Still, they are buying more hybrids.</p>
              <p>Of course, everything should not be just about cents and dollars, we also need to do things based on a environmentally friendly and emissions point of view issnt it?</p>

                  <p>As for biodiesel, its a positive path as its generated from
                  waste (relatively renewable), but when scaling to sbst + smrt's
                  fleet of 3000 over (which each bus can take ~300l of diesel), the
                  quantity of biodiesel that can be generated comes into question.
                  The fuel efficiency of a blend of biodiesel+diesel is also not as
                  high as what diesel can offer.</p>

                  Just maintain a smaller fleet of buses using biodiesel.

              <p>Two options to go:</p>
              <p>- better fuel consumption per passenger per (mile) km with bigger capacity (planes) vehicles</p>
              <p>- better overall fuel efficiency with better (composites) material technology and (engine) drivetrain technology</p>

              <p>Biodiesel can be used by existing buses that run on diesel. The exhaust will smell of fast food too. :P It could cause the growth of algae though. </p>

              <p>I think the immaturity of the technology and costs of operating such buses still remains high. I don't think that the passengers are willingly to fork out more fares to pay for such buses.</p>
