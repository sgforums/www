From then, 2 WL buses were used - TIB322D (S Shift - also an old Nissan bus) and TIB638T (AP Shift - OAC Scania).

In the middle of the journey, I've once alighted at one bus stop and transfer to an AC bus on Sv 176.<br><br>BTW, DAFs with Hispano bodyworks are quite comfortable for me back then. Recall TIB401J on 176 before the first 14 DAF buses (TIB391D-TIB404B) were sold to NZ, while the rest were transferred to CSS fleet in 1997. It also reminds me of the DAFs on 950, 951 &amp; 952, as it was settled on services like 75, 181, 187 etc. after 950, 951 &amp; 952 withdrawn.</div>
