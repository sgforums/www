In SBS Transit,to Bus Captain. Because he is no longer only a driver. He is someone who has to ensure safety of passengers, integrity of the fare collections, in time of crisis react accordingly to the needs of the situations. Like the recent flood. I lost some bus parts due to the flood. But luckily my depot seemingly suffered the least loss. Even though the BC does not require too high educational level, they are somewhat cannot live without. Work almost endlessly with only a miserable 1 day rest perweek. Sometimes consecutively 20days in order to meet the demands of the public.<br><br>Let's respect this group of guys who make a public transport system possible.</div>
