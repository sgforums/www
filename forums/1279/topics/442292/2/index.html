Unlikely they will take out 3 SP KUBs from BNDEP to put into 292 and 403, and leave only 1 spare KUB in its fleet.</p>
              <p>175 just probably needs 5 Citaros to clear those 5 JB Mk3s then done alr.</p>
              <p>And for 292, probably they will go with 1 additional Euro V instead of Euro IV to kick out one of the Mk4 DMs.</p>

              <p>They tend to deploy new WABs for the east side services on the Monday before the due date of the WAB status launch. It was the same for 354 last time. It's likely, or probably the BCs need the familiarisation before the actual permers are decided.</p>

              out 3 SP KUBs from BNDEP to put into 292 and 403, and leave only 1
              spare KUB in its fleet.</p>
              <p>175 just probably needs 5 Citaros to clear those 5 JB Mk3s then
              done alr.</p>
              <p>And for 292, probably they will go with 1 additional Euro V

              <p>For 81, they are only missing 3 WAB DDs to hit the min quota. 81 has very heavy pax loads during the peak hours. And now after Nex mall opened, the load is practically always there for people looking to get back to the East faster than 109 would take. That was why when 8581M &amp; 8582K left 81 back then to go to 29, 81 got back 2614S &amp; 2633L instead, not 2 other KUBs as replacements. So imo, 81 is waiting for new Wrights to be deployed. There's no way any more WAB SDs can go into 81 as replacements, because of the heavy loads during peak hours. Nor do i think they will give out any spare Euro Vs for now, since the Wrights in BNDEP seem to be going nowhere, and there's no new Citaros. </p>
              <p>But another service possible to give out their KUBs from BN is Service 3. They are actually running 2 excess KUBs above the min quota, and somehow the lone Euro IV 8220E is still there while its siblings have all gone elsewhere to do feeder services. (8213B, 8223Y with 228 now). But just guesses anyway.</p>
              <p>For 87, i think they might actually just run more Wrights than what they do now on weekends, then the rest they run a mix of KUBs &amp; Mk4s.

              <p>Yeaps the 29 part was true, but undoubtedly BN could have given back 81 2 KUBs as replacements from its spare fleet (iirc there was some). But they gave back 2 Striders which had obviously more seats (and they deploy those Striders right in the time period where the heaviest loads of 81 would be towards Tamp &amp; Serangoon for peak hours). The loads from Tampines in the morning is really heavy, sometimes 2 Euro Vs bunch together also can't transport everyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Yeaps, the small number of permers on the feeder services is exactly why they were able to launch that many WAB services this time. The number of WABs they need for each service to hit the quota is significantly lower to put all those 6 BBDEP feeder services WAB status, compared to let's say the no. of buses they need for a single service like 16 or even 87 to make them WAB.</p>
