              <p>Pt 1 - SBST was late in having WAB? Why SBST need to go buy WAB
              in 1998 when the infrastructure are not there? the bus stops are
              not all ready for PIW. The pathment are all not accessible by PIW
              (person in wheelchair)... so they buy also no use .. the PIW cant
              even get to the bus stops..  Why dun u go and bash LTA or
              Singapore Gov? further what can 20 dennis trident do if they are
              WAB? the most can be deploy on one service?</p>
              <p>PT 2 - why cant they achieve 90% fleet to be WAB by 2015? 
              what make u think they are lagging in deregistering the buses? the
              lifespan have not been up yet and time is needed to build the buses
              as well.. since last  year till now, they haev registered 160
              Citaros + 100+ Wrights DDs... which is more than 25% of the new
              fleet order. 9 months  What make you think they are unable to
              roll out another 750 buses within the next 2 years? dun bash for
              the sake of bashing... go and bash SMRT instead...</p>
              <p>and i dun understand why you are saying it is unfair to the old
              buses?? why is it unfair? retire them early is fair?</p>
              <p>PT3 - LO2x original lifespan was only  12 years, it was
              extended to 15 years... so now u are asking why these NAC LO2x are
              not extended till 19 years and at the same time are asking why the
              VO2x  are staying till end of their lifespan? dun understand
              your logic.. pls lah.. for the past 100 years, singapore weather is
              the same.. the older generation can take those NAC buses and yet
              nowadays, those new generation ppl are unable to take NAC
              buses?  dun blow too much aircon. it is not good for
              you...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually I should say the LO2X were lucky enough to be de-registered after 17 years of service, even though they were supposed to be de-registered in 2001-2002 as their 15 years lifespan comes to an end back then.</p>

                  years covert to a 100% air conditioned bus fleet. That is too long,
                  and it is so unfair to the old buses. I remember 10 years ago,
                  those LO2X retire so early. They retired by age 15, those buses

                  buses and NAC buses are unacceptable in a advanced developed
                  international city where the area is tropical and hot. The city

              What I mean by old buses are buses in the past that retire early, like the LO2X that retire during 2001 to 2003. And why do you think in 2 years, it could even be less than 2 years until 2015 that 90% of the fleet could be new, it is impossible and they are lying, how could so much buses de-register, if they utilized their lifespan? If they utilized the old buses 19 years now, so as in 2015. Then they will lag behind and can't meet the goal they created. They keep creating so many new services and deploy so many additional buses, no way possible that 9/10 buses to be new described by the article. 
              
              And nowadays are different from the past, you see the whole world temperature is increasing, even Singapore will get hotter, and life standard have increase. It is not like the past in those day where there is no ac and no advanced tech., and low standard that developing countries have.

              In less than 5 days, the first registered Volvo Olympian 3 axles unit (batch 1) will be retired on 9th June 2013.

              Slowly and steadily, the last Alexander Royale bodywork type with round headlamps at the front will walk into history (along with its two axles variant which will also retire around this time period).

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Oh? Then I suggest you go to SMRT AMDEP and see how many buses are NOT deployed due to maintenance issues and engine overhaul, comparing to those from SBST. Even though SBST has more buses, but SMRT had a larger number of buses not being deployed due to such trivial issues.+</span></p>

              If they want 90% of the fleet to be new, i have calculated that they need over 2500 new buses. Even the 200 sd buses + 200 dd buses are gone, they can hardly achieve that number by 2 years. If they can't do it, then don't say it.

              <p>LO2X were de-registered after 15 years, not 17 years. Those
                      registered in 1988 were completely gone by late 2003..</p>

              <p>Nope. Buses registered in 1986-1987 are also de-registered in 2003 as they had been given 2 years lifespan extension back in 2001-2002 (that applies to our current buses today).</p>
              <p>Look at SBS6908T for example (the rest you can go and check at OM), it is registered on 10 Dec 1986 and de-registered on 12 May 2003.</p>
