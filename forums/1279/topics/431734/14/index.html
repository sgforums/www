                                                  WAB quota, so SBST have to laid up those O405 and other buses
                                                  earlier and registered new buses much faster...  right now,
                                                  there is BSEP program which help to utilize the new buses, so SBST
                                                  can slow down the normal registration...</p>
                                                  <p>btw, 9205 is at the side of amdep lay up corner for 3-4

                                SBST service is good in terms of frequency and bringing new services. But is shit in providing bus service facilities and maintenance, like WAB service they only provide it until 2002, but other areas in Asia already have WAB buses and still having NAC buses on the street. I remember back a year ago I read a news article that said that SBST fleet will be full WAB by 2015 (if i am correct), now i don't see that happening if they want utilized their bus lifespan. It is at least 2021, they will have full a full WAB fleet. Another news article SBST said them will retire all NAC by 2013 April. Now they just forgot about it and retire according to their lifespan. This company is just a Liar, they just make some promise and break/change their promise some time later. If they can't do, then don't make the promise. 
                                
              
              I also think it is unfair for the buses now have longer lifespan. In the past buses in good condition retire early, now those buses could get lifespan extension, they are so lucky. Those buses in the past have bad luck.

              <p>oh.. u r bashing SBST? i dun understand what u mean by providing WAB until 2002? why dun u bash SMRT instead? SBST have already provided so many WABs services... and there isnt any article that SBST fleet will be FULL WAB by 2015. Dateline set by LTA is 2020 and even so, all SBST services should be WAB accessible by 2015 (cos they dun need 100% WAB bus)... look at SMRT, cant even meet the 40% quota of WAB fleet by 2010??  they are using their MAN buses on all sorts of service.. throw one bus here and there..</p>
              <p>and for NAC article, cant SBST change their mind? is that consider lie? these are business decision and SBST have to allocate more than 50 Wrights (plus almost 100 citaros) to fulfil the obligation for BSEP programs, therefore the NAC are staying longer... What is wrong with that?  are you taking the NAC everyday?</p>

              SBS has its first WAB in 2002, this is very late compare to other Asia places. Japan and Hong Kong already have WAS in 1998. When they bought in the Dennis Tridents in 2000, they should have add in wheelchair facilities. So again, SBS have overemphasis on improving frequency and bringing new service. They have missed to improve bus facilities and maintenance. I was wrong mentioning having a full WAB bus fleet, it should have been this article, SBS Transit to Add 1,000 More Buses At A Cost of $433m - Close to 90% of Fleet Will Be New By 2015: http://sgforums.com/forums/1279/topics/455371. I don't think this is possible, now they are just utilizing bus lifespans, how could 90% of the bus fleet be new by 2015, if they now lag in retiring the buses? What a lie! If they can't meet their goal they made, then what is the point of making a goal and a promise? SBS should only make a promise if they could accomplish it. Now they can't do it, then don't say it first!
              
              In 2004, they said they have over 90% of the bus fleet air conditioned. They need to take up 10 years covert to a 100% air conditioned bus fleet. That is too long, and it is so unfair to the old buses. I remember 10 years ago, those LO2X retire so early. They retired by age 15, those buses were good condition. Why not give them a 19 year lifespan, if SBS don't care converting the bus fleet to full a/c? I do take non a/c buses and NAC buses are unacceptable in a advanced developed international city where the area is tropical and hot. The city should have high and international standard services. You think Singapore is like other SE developing countries/cities such as Malaysia, using cheap NAC buses? Your thoughts must be stuck under 40 years ago, when the country was still a developing country.

              <p>Pt 1 - SBST was late in having WAB? Why SBST need to go buy WAB in 1998 when the infrastructure are not there? the bus stops are not all ready for PIW. The pathment are all not accessible by PIW (person in wheelchair)... so they buy also no use .. the PIW cant even get to the bus stops..  Why dun u go and bash LTA or Singapore Gov? further what can 20 dennis trident do if they are WAB? the most can be deploy on one service?</p>
              <p>PT 2 - why cant they achieve 90% fleet to be WAB by 2015?  what make u think they are lagging in deregistering the buses? the lifespan have not been up yet and time is needed to build the buses as well.. since last  year till now, they haev registered 160 Citaros + 100+ Wrights DDs... which is more than 25% of the new fleet order. 9 months  What make you think they are unable to roll out another 750 buses within the next 2 years? dun bash for the sake of bashing... go and bash SMRT instead...</p>
              <p>and i dun understand why you are saying it is unfair to the old buses?? why is it unfair? retire them early is fair?</p>
              <p>PT3 - LO2x original lifespan was only  12 years, it was extended to 15 years... so now u are asking why these NAC LO2x are not extended till 19 years and at the same time are asking why the VO2x  are staying till end of their lifespan? dun understand your logic.. pls lah.. for the past 100 years, singapore weather is the same.. the older generation can take those NAC buses and yet nowadays, those new generation ppl are unable to take NAC buses?  dun blow too much aircon. it is not good for you...</p>
