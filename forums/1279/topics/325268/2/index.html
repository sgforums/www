              <p>Well, let me repeat that this is a freelance project undertaken by my friend, Z (not his real name but a hint as his name starts with a Z). He is a student in Kent Ridge Secondary and this is his final O Level project. This bus would be kept there from now till end of this year O Levels unfortunately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More recently, he, along with myself undertook an OC500LE Toy project. Well, it's smaller in size and the scale should be 1:60 or 1:80. I will publish the photos but the model is now doing some final touches by myself in school. The paint job is by him and the body work is by myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About the KUB model, it's driven by an RC motor that moves the bus and the doors opens but unfortunately, the remote control was not with him at the time I met him so the bus door mechanisim could not be tested automatically but manually. The bus has LED Headlights, Drawn destos which is lightened up by LEDs. LED Tail Lights and LED Interior Lights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More about him: He is a bus fan as well but is an offline sort of person. He have a custom made 'bus' bag that has a doorbell, a horn from a UD and a gearbox switch from a B10M MK-II. Please, if you see someone horning from behind next time, be on the look out for him.</p>

It is like u make this machine called "The Item Duplicator and Shrinkener" and when u see ur fav bus like the OC500LE, u use that machine and duplicate it and thus shrink it to a tissue box sized bus... lol... &amp; then u can display and show off to other people ur miniature bus.. If the machine is in reality, wah... surely can get loads of money by selling the buses...</p></div>
