            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there everyone! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Actually... Even some of the Scania L113s and ELBOs too can move even without closing both the doors. I've even seen one incident before... The service captain opened both doors while slowly down at a fast speed, which to me's really dangerous. Wont any passenger nearly got flown out of the bus? I do wonder... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard from one of the drivers I know, that the locking device can be turned off using a "switch" near the door controls. On most buses there are 2 of these switches covered by red caps, but I'm not sure which one turns off the locking device.<br><br>On certain Habits the locking device is modified to lock only the exit service doors. IMO it's probably because some of the entrance electronic doors have problems closing; only by accelerating the bus slightly, then the door will close properly.</div>
