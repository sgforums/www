              <p>car population has never decreased despite PTC's and LTA's constant efforts encouraging singapore to take public transport. It never happened when NEL was built, never when Circle line was built and definitely not now.</p>

              <p>But it doesnt make sense cos like I said, shareholders are ultimately affected when revenue goes down. Why will these transport companies spend millions on a new system only to see revenue go down? How can you a bus enthusiast say u dun care about shareholders....</p>

              <p><br>if I design e whole system, it ought to be bus/ MRT travelling time combi be like 1990s level.</p>
              <p>Those days, less jam buses could be able to provide better frequency compared to now even w/ SBS's fleet of 2700 then vs 3000 buses now. For 300 more buses, they need to spend money and yet ridership remained stable - not good for shareholders if we were to really compare.</p>
              <p>Also when you've more riders you've e push to do things better literally - things like iris.</p>
              <p>Seriously speaking, if really we talk abt shareholders interest, maybe the farecard idea tat propped up before MRT was built would have never surfaced - imagine the upfront cost needed to invest in e system.</p>
              <p>End of e day, if look at e system for the commuters 1st, eventually as things get efficient the shareholders do benefit.</p>
              <p>As for distance fare, I've alrdy said before, there's some form of govt politics to push ridership as well.</p>

              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;">Dataset error led to wrong charges: LTA</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <br>LTA now working with SBS, SMRT to check data <br><br>Jul 16, 2010 <br><br>Today Exclusive <br><br>SINGAPORE - If not for an alert Today reader, bus commuters travelling along a stretch at Buona Vista may well still be over-charged for their rides. <strong>And the question now is if the error he uncovered is happening elsewhere. <br></strong><br>Mr Dennis Puk Leung Kong had spotted that the distance in opposite directions between two bus-stops on North Buona Vista Road and Commonwealth Avenue differed on the public transport fare calculator website. On the eve of distance-based fares kicking in, he wrote in to highlight the "inconsistency". <br><br>MediaCorp posed the question to the authorities on July 6 and, yesterday, the Land Transport Authority confirmed there was indeed an error. The distance between the bus stops opposite Block 43, Commonwealth Avenue, and opposite Buona Vista MRT Station should be 0.3 kilometres, and not 0.6 km as originally computed. <br><br>The error has been rectified, said an LTA spokeswoman. "This was due to a dataset error, where the additional distance from an earlier temporary local route diversion was not reversed after the diversion was over," she said. <br><br><strong>The number of commuters affected by this error is "likely to be small", she said, without giving an estimate</strong>. The LTA is now working with public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT to confirm that there are no similar errors elsewhere. <br><br>The spokeswoman added that commuters affected between July 3 - when distance-based fares kicked in - and July 9 can make their claims via Transitlink's website (www.transitlink.com.sg), at its ticket offices or can call its hotline at 1800 225 5663. The bus services plying the two stops are 74, 91, 95, 191, 196, 198 and 200. All are SBS services. <br><br>Commuters at Buona Vista last night were forgiving of the error. "The area has been under construction for some time, so it can be quite messy," said undergraduate Ooi Shan Chin, 21. <strong>He will not be checking if he is eligible for any refund, as "it's too tedious for a few cents". <br></strong><br><strong>Another commuter, programmer Mr Kim, 39, said the error was acceptable as long as the authorities allowed for claims, and added that he would check.</strong> <br><br>MediaCorp was unable to reach Mr Puk by press time last night but, in his initial email, the National University of Singapore systems engineer noted that the "crux of distance fares lies in the distance dataset used to calculate the fares". <br><br>He added: "If the accuracy of the dataset is questionable, commuters may find themselves incorrectly charged ... Multiply this across a number of stops travelled and one could be unknowingly over-paying for distance not travelled." <br><br>Adult ez-link bus fares for air-con services increase by 1 to 10 cents between the different distance bands. <br><br>LTA said it is "carefully looking out for such teething issues" in the initial phase of the new fare system, and would be doing "immediate rectification whenever necessary". <br><br>"We apologise for any inconvenience caused," said its spokeswoman.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>bullshit?</p>
              <p>if the thing is not efficient, how are operators going to make money?</p>
              <p>Since there's real example, take a look at Malaysia. Even with diesel subsidy, no need to spend money onto farecard system and need not purchase bigger fleet like double decks and yet they're still making losses!</p>
              <p>Why? Simply they dun have all e basic decent things for efficient operations. I'm talking abt making bus schedules and so on.</p>
              <p>Seriously if you're saying bullshit, you can forget abt them using farecard or iris.. We would be back to e old days paying by coins and bus operator hire ppl to collect and transport e coins to the banks daily.</p>
              <p>Needless to mention abt e iris and it's came about.</p>

On the eve of distance-based fares kicking in, he wrote in to highlight the "inconsistency".<br><br>MediaCorp posed the question to the authorities on July 6 and, yesterday, the Land Transport Authority confirmed there was indeed an error. The distance between the bus stops opposite Block 43, Commonwealth Avenue, and opposite Buona Vista MRT Station should be 0.3 kilometres, and not 0.6 km as originally computed.<br><br>The error has been rectified, said an LTA spokeswoman. "This was due to a dataset error, where the additional distance from an earlier temporary local route diversion was not reversed after the diversion was over," she said.<br><br><strong>The number of commuters affected by this error is "likely to be small", she said, without giving an estimate</strong>. The LTA is now working with public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT to confirm that there are no similar errors elsewhere.<br><br>The spokeswoman added that commuters affected between July 3 - when distance-based fares kicked in - and July 9 can make their claims via Transitlink's website (www.transitlink.com.sg), at its ticket offices or can call its hotline at 1800 225 5663. The bus services plying the two stops are 74, 91, 95, 191, 196, 198 and 200. All are SBS services.<br><br>Commuters at Buona Vista last night were forgiving of the error. "The area has been under construction for some time, so it can be quite messy," said undergraduate Ooi Shan Chin, 21. <strong>He will not be checking if he is eligible for any refund, as "it's too tedious for a few cents".<br></strong><br><strong>Another commuter, programmer Mr Kim, 39, said the error was acceptable as long as the authorities allowed for claims, and added that he would check.</strong><br><br>MediaCorp was unable to reach Mr Puk by press time last night but, in his initial email, the National University of Singapore systems engineer noted that the "crux of distance fares lies in the distance dataset used to calculate the fares".<br><br>He added: "If the accuracy of the dataset is questionable, commuters may find themselves incorrectly charged ... Multiply this across a number of stops travelled and one could be unknowingly over-paying for distance not travelled."<br><br>Adult ez-link bus fares for air-con services increase by 1 to 10 cents between the different distance bands.<br><br>LTA said it is "carefully looking out for such teething issues" in the initial phase of the new fare system, and would be doing "immediate rectification whenever necessary".<br><br>"We apologise for any inconvenience caused," said its spokeswoman.</span></span></p>

              <p>yeah lor :( actually previously express were meant to be a one-trip service, meaning they try to make as many people within walking distance of the service since it is most effective for people who used to have to take MRT and transfer to a feeder, who both save on fares and enjoy the convenience the most.</p>
              <p>hope this brings about a revamp and more direct express services so people can make use of them only for its express sector then move on to other services, but this might also diminish the convenience appeal of express services.</p>
