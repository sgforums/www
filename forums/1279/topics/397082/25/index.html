              <p>yes! because there is no such thing as a transfer rebate or penalty now because it is purely distance-based for the whole journey now.</p>
              <p>you can visit their website, but it's either you understand it immediately or you take a bit of experiment to realise how simple the idea is, notwithstanding that you might have to pay more for some of your journey, especially those direct trips :x</p>

              <p>Hi guys I have a big query as i think i'm being cheated here...</p>
              <p>SBS Svc 179 (boonlay-NTU) and SMRT Svc 169 (AMK-WDL) are both similar in terms of both being trunk services right?</p>
              <p>If so, why is it that based on the apparent 'distance' fare, it only costs 3cents on 179 to get from pioneer mrt to NTU canteen A after transfer from mrt (which is a heck of a walk of about 6 stops), but it costs 20cents on 169 to get from AMK hub to the busstop opp Mayflower sec after a bus transfer (which is merely 4 stops away and only a 10-15min walk)?</p>
              <p>WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS 600+% EXTRA CHARGE??????</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You need to change your thinking from the fare stage era to the distance fare era</p>
              <p>Cos how much you are charged on the subsequent trips after your first trip depends on how much distance you cover beforehand.</p>
              <p>To get 20c on your S169 ride you may have probably travelled maximum 4.2km on your previous trip. Which means to say u may have come from TechPlace AMK Ave 5, Serangoon Ave 2 or probably Hougang Ave 8, before transferring to 169 to Mayflower Sec. The earlier trip that you travelled up to 4.2km will cost you 81c, then transfer to S169 for a 20c 4 stop ride at 1.7km. This gives a total fare of 101c for a 5.9km journey.</p>
              <p>To get 3c on your S179 ride you are very likely to have taken 166/169 from Mayflower Sec to AMK Int OR 132/165 to AMK MRT, then MRT to Pioneer then 179.</p>
              <p>S132/165/166/169 ride costs you 71c for 1.7km <br>MRT ride from AMK to Pioneer cost you 117c for 32.9km<br>S179 ride from Pioneer MRT to Canteen A costs you 3c for 3.1km<br>Total 37.7km 191c</p>
              <p>If you see the fare chart the total fare is only tabulated based on your <strong>FULL </strong>journey, and not <strong>EACH </strong>journey that you take. That is why as long as you transfer, the fare for your transferred journey varies depending on how far you have travelled. That's because the per km fare band the incremental value for shorter distances is higher (at 10c per km jump) than longer distances (at 1c per km jump).</p>
              <p>So dont worry you are not cheated :)</p>

              <p>as for Sv 169, it's because your prior traveling distance before the transfer to Sv 169 is between 2.6km and 3.2km (which costs 71¢), causing your cumulative distance after the 1.7km ride on Sv 169 to fall into the 91¢ band.</p>

              <p><br>To make your money worth, transfer more but keep in mind your transfer count (not more than 5 within a 2 hour period and not more than 45min between each transfer)</p>
              <p>Let's say from Dunearn Rd College Green to Serangoon Rd St Michael's Place, direct bus is 66. If 66 never come how? 170 came, hop it to Little India, wait 1.5min saw 67 and hop on, then Farrer Park there alight wait for 2 traffic lights hop onto a 65. I believe you save time this way than waiting for 66.</p>
              <p>But of course if the 66 comes during the wait then might as well hop onto it. :)</p>
              <p>In a sense there's alot of benefits behind this structure. Problem is that the layman needs a very long while to finally get the idea what the whole system is actually about. That's also the reason why LTA's examples are only that few and they scared if they elaborate more they may confuse the layman instead.</p>

              <p>Let us cross-examined CNA’s quote of fare change justification.</p>
              <p>“Under the new system, about two-thirds of commuters will pay less.<br> Those who make single or short trips may lose out. The new calculation 
              method removes the “transfer penalty”, which is the amount commuters pay
               each time they make transfers during a single journey. The authorities 
              have said the aim is to provide for a fairer way of calculating fares.”</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1068811/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1068811/1/.html</a></p>
              <p>It says only about one-third of the customers pay more since 
              two-thirds are allegedly paying less – was this a train ACCIDENT or was 
              it a planned outcome.</p>
              <p>If it was a planned outcome, why did they as a listed business 
              expended so much effort and how did they planned for a revenue loss for 
              so much efforts expended on discovery how to help the customers save 
              fare. SMRT must be an ardent “charity” organisation to have planned so 
              hard for this outcome which angered commuters – LOSE LOSE OUTCOME FOR 
              CUSTOMERS AND SMRT unless customers are the only ones in the blind.</p>
              <p>But look at this comment – it is PROFUNDITY TO ME at casual read 
              -”Those who make single or short trips may lose out”. The logic is 
              perverse of my comprehension.</p>
              <p>Short trips customers lose out is probably something which SMRT is 
              aware of its intended outcome in this changed fare structure. But 
              “single trips” include BOTH SHORT TRIPS AND LONG TRIPS. That comment is 
              carefully silent on single trips include long trips – it was a void of 
              leaving angry customers to fill in the blank of truth or falsehood of 
              incomplete public declaration.</p>
              <p>So did long trips (single also) lose out as well in tuth known to 
              SMRT? Or they don’t know and yet claims that more 2/3 of the customers 
              pay less??. Given the long trips available on a single track, let say 
              from Sengkang to Harbourfront and Jurong West line – who needs to make a
               lot of short trips to reach destinations when we can switch at 
              interchange without SMRT knowing?</p>
              <p>The reasonable conclusion available is that LONG TRIPS ALSO PAYS 
              MORE. So how did LHH concludes that two-thirds are paying LESS????? I 
              failed my maths and also failed my kindergarten leaving examination. 
              Please forgive my poverty of intellect and profound stupidity if I am 
              wrong here. Can someone explains the seemingly SELF-CONTRADICTION LOGIC 
              IN CNA’S QUOTE OF</p>
              <p>“Those who make single or short trips may lose out”????</p>
              <p>The logic and the maths don’t add up. My thoughts are that it could 
              be “long trips and short trips all pay more” and the extrapolation is 
              that more than two-thirds of the customers pay a lot more and a few of 
              the remaining pay less.</p>
              <p>The logic of the CNA quote left me to puzzle if the order is muddled 
              up into chaos leaving the truth to be then conveniently “explained 
              otherwise” contrary of factual reality in the momentary confusion of 
              public mind.</p>
              <p>UNLESS OF COURSE, SMRT DECIDED THAT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT APPLICATION
               OF THE FAME “CHEAPER,FASTER AND BETTER” MANTRA. Given the overcrowding 
              and the need to invest in technology upgrade and adding more carriage, 
              SMRT might actually need less money and less fare from its customers to 
              “improve” that service in the cover “long-term” consideration as a 
              public charity???.</p>
              <p>I am still WONDERING in deep silly thoughts.</p>

              <p>I'm also sceptical. 2/3 of commuters save fares? They spent millions to design the system and implement, only to help us save fares......so how do they justify the drop in revenue to the shareholders? Or are other sources of revenue coming up strongly?</p>

              <p><br>the whole overhaul in km based fares is because of e long run.</p>
              <p>The old way makes it less incline for me to x-fer as my transfered mode of bus or MRT's fare is retabulated minus 50c rebate/ penalty.</p>
              <p>With more MRT lines (DTL, CCL4/ 5, likely ERL) as well as the growing bus network (due to new town, industrial or new travelling pattern demand), in time to come there's likely going to be more transfer.</p>
              <p>Another attritbute I believe in e pt of operations is better utilisation of especially bus resources. We can't be having direct bus svs to and fro every connection for every town.</p>
