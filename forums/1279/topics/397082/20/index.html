              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>You are entirely missing the crux of my post. The purpose of my
              post is to objectively and clearly point out that my fares has
              risen, by a significant extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this time round</span>. It was not
              meant to be a historical comparison of prices because: (1): There
              is no end to such historical comparison of prices (How far back do
              we want to compare to? When feeder fares were still 25¢? When
              policemen were still wearing shorts?); (2) That would be digressing
              from the very purpose of my post, and the topic (Distance Fares) in
              the first place.</p>
              <p>Hmm.. you are using Oct 07-Oct 08 prices. Why? In 2007/8, though
              there was a bus hike where all the bus fares across all fare bands
              increased, people taking this bus journey (43/70/76-&gt;90) will
              benefit because they increased the transfer rebate from 25¢-40¢. In
              a sense, you are doing selective statistical comparison here.
              Incidentally (or purposefully), the 2008 fares are the priciest for
              that particular bus journey.</p>
              <p>Why did you say in order to make a <strong>true</strong> comparison, take 2008 fares? Why can't I take
              2009/07/06/05/04/03/02/01, etc etc etc where fares, as a whole, are
              lower as the <strong>true</strong> comparison? Kindly justify.</p>
              <p>Evidently, you neglected the fact that when the transfer rebates
              rose from 25¢-40¢ in Oct 08, fares across ALL fare bands increased!
              That increase affected EVERYONE (though some will still benefit
              because of the increase in transfer rebates), it was reported that
              it's a fare hike. Hence, the increase of transfer rebates from
              25¢-40¢ is NOT a blessing engendered by the bus companies; it's
              merely a transfer of revenue sources, for the revenue lost from
              this increase had been shrewdly incorporated in the increase of
              basic fares.</p>
              <p>What about other fares that went uncommented? The senior citizen
              fares? According to your "true" comparison, the increment of senior
              citizen fares is even greater! Direct journeys lagi worse (as
              you've acknowledged).</p>
              <p>I may be wrong, but from the way you crafted your post, the way
              you seemed so deferential towards SBST/PTC (such as thanking them
              for the subjective increase in rebates), you come across to me as
              someone with vested interests - are you working for SBST/SMRT, or a
              shareholder? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> If you are neither, you can consider being either
              of the two.</p>
              <p>Above all, let me reiterate that the point of my post is to show
              that people who do transfers may not benefit from distance fares,
              which is widely purported to benefit them in the first place.
              Senior Citizens, as whole, will also suffer. Adults taking direct
              journeys will suffer. Period.</p>

              <p>I just want to tell you that in 2008 before the rebate is increase from 25 cts to 40 cts, the fare that you are paying is S$1.09....(based on 67 cents + 42 cents) So after the so called increase in 2008, you are paying 71 ct + (71-40 cts) = S$1.02.....and by further increase the rebate to 50 cts in 2009, you are paying S$0.88.... so within the past two years, the fare have decreased from 1.09 to 0.88. Now it have indeed increase back to S$1.01...but still it is lower than the 2008 price... and hey, the price that i took for 2008 is BEFORE increase to 71 cts price... Why is it the pricest price? You did not read carefully my post at all.</p>
              <p>67 cents compare to 71 cents? which is more expensive?</p>
              <p>if PTC DID NOT increase the rebate that time, then you will see the saving in the fare for transfer NOW... do you understand? I am taking 2008 price as that is the time when the transfer rebate increase to 40 cts.... in the previous years before 2007, there isnt any INCREASE in rebate.... so i do not wish to take it as example....like what i have mention, when there is decrease of fare from 1.09 to 0.88, no one appreciate...</p>
              <p>As for senior citizens wise, that is the PTC decision.. and whether PAP will lose these senior citizens's vote or not, i cant say. My parents are also senior citizens and they are do affected by this increase... I am just telling you the example of increase in transfer rebates only and nothing else, which we cant change the facts that the price is already changed... unless you dun take bus or mrt..</p>
              <p>and i am not working in PTC/SBST and i am taking public transport as well. I am do affected by the increase in direct fare....what i am mentioning is all about the increase in transfer rebates which caused in this so called increase of fare right now...</p>
              <p>when PTC increase the fare in 2008 with increase in rebates, they still kenna a lot of complain...when in actual fact, many trips involving transfer are incurring less fares.</p>
              <p>So imagine if they keep the transfer rebates as 25 cents from 2008 to now, the price that you will be paying as follows:</p>
              <p>2008 - before increase in fare - 67 cents + 42cents = 109 cents<br>2008-2009(after increase in fare) -- 71 cents + 46 cents = 117 cents<br>2009- June 2010 - 69 cents + 44 cents = 113 cents (not 88 cents)<br>from July 2010 onwards - 101 cents (5.6 km)</p>
              <p>so it is wrong for PTC to increase the rebates from 25 cts to 40 cts to 50 cts then.they should just keep it as 25 cents till June 2010, so that they can go claim that the fare involving transfer have indeed DECREASE.</p>

              <p>I just want to tell you that in 2008 before the rebate is
              increase from 25 cts to 40 cts, the fare that you are paying is
              S$1.09....(based on 67 cents + 42 cents) So after the so called
              increase in 2008, you are paying 71 ct + (71-40 cts) =
              S$1.02.....and by further increase the rebate to 50 cts in 2009,
              you are paying S$0.88.... so within the past two years, the fare
              have decreased from 1.09 to 0.88. Now it have indeed increase back
              to S$1.01...but still it is lower than the 2008 price... and hey,
              the price that i took for 2008 is BEFORE increase to 71 cts
              price... Why is it the pricest price? You did not read carefully my
              post at all.</p>
              <p>67 cents compare to 71 cents? which is more expensive?</p>
              <p>if PTC DID NOT increase the rebate that time, then you will see
              the saving in the fare for transfer NOW... do you understand? I am
              taking 2008 price as that is the time when the transfer rebate
              increase to 40 cts.... in the previous years before 2007, there
              isnt any INCREASE in rebate.... so i do not wish to take it as
              example....like what i have mention, when there is decrease of fare
              from 1.09 to 0.88, no one appreciate...</p>
              <p>As for senior citizens wise, that is the PTC decision.. and
              whether PAP will lose these senior citizens's vote or not, i cant
              say. My parents are also senior citizens and they are do affected
              by this increase... I am just telling you the example of increase
              in transfer rebates only and nothing else, which we cant change the
              facts that the price is already changed... unless you dun take bus
              or mrt..</p>
              <p>and i am not working in PTC/SBST and i am taking public
              transport as well. I am do affected by the increase in direct
              fare....what i am mentioning is all about the increase in transfer
              rebates which caused in this so called increase of fare right
              now...</p>
              <p>when PTC increase the fare in 2008 with increase in rebates,
              they still kenna a lot of complain...when in actual fact, many
              trips involving transfer are incurring less fares.</p>
              <p>So imagine if they keep the transfer rebates as 25 cents from
              2008 to now, the price that you will be paying as follows:</p>
              <p>2008 - before increase in fare - 67 cents + 42cents = 109
              cents<br> 2008-2009(after increase in fare) -- 71 cents + 46 cents = 117
              cents<br> 2009- June 2010 - 69 cents + 44 cents = 113 cents (not 88
              cents)<br> from July 2010 onwards - 101 cents (5.6 km)</p>
              <p>so it is wrong for PTC to increase the rebates from 25 cts to 40
              cts to 50 cts then.they should just keep it as 25 cents till June
              2010, so that they can go claim that the fare involving transfer
              have indeed DECREASE.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Your explanations are pretty clear but the rebate increases are actually reluctant, considering the public anger at the relentless price hikes. And from late 2008 onwards the Lehmann bros crisis came, it was inevitable that SBS had to increase the rebates in view of many Sgporeans facing hardships. So it wouldnt be really right to say that SBS was wrong to have increased the rebates because it wasn't an option at all.</p>
              <p>The rebate crap is just a cushion such that the transport operators need not permanently reduce prices at all.</p>

              <p>Actual this one the revenue drop is due to the minimum 2-cent discount plus upping transfer rebate from 40¢ to 50¢. now waiting for FY 2010.</p>

              <p>Tks :) Very clear cut indeed. Revenue has dropped due largely to the rebates given from 2008 onwards.</p>
              <p>Interestingly enough, revenue has also increased by $30-$60m a year from 2005 till 2008. Not surprising given the constant hikes before 2008. And then the Lehman crisis struck in late 2008, so that could largely explain the initiative to raise rebates subsequently. Perhaps projected forecasts have predicted that 2009 would be a year of lower earnings from bus rides, therefore some scholar at the top decides to implement a recession proof distance based fare to ensure that revenues do not drop again? haha.</p>
              <p><br>Nevertheless, they still made the 2nd highest profit after tax among all the years from 2005-2009, due largely to "internal funds generated". Anyone knows what that means?</p>

              <p>I just want to tell you that in 2008 before the rebate is
                          increase from 25 cts to 40 cts, the fare that you are paying is
                          S$1.09....(based on 67 cents + 42 cents) So after the so called
                          increase in 2008, you are paying 71 ct + (71-40 cts) =
                          S$1.02.....and by further increase the rebate to 50 cts in 2009,
                          you are paying S$0.88.... so within the past two years, the fare
                          have decreased from 1.09 to 0.88. Now it have indeed increase back
                          to S$1.01...but still it is lower than the 2008 price... and hey,
                          the price that i took for 2008 is BEFORE increase to 71 cts
                          price... Why is it the pricest price? You did not read carefully my
                          post at all.</p>
              <p>67 cents compare to 71 cents? which is more expensive?</p>
              <p>if PTC DID NOT increase the rebate that time, then you will see
                          the saving in the fare for transfer NOW... do you understand? I am
                          taking 2008 price as that is the time when the transfer rebate
                          increase to 40 cts.... in the previous years before 2007, there
                          isnt any INCREASE in rebate.... so i do not wish to take it as
                          example....like what i have mention, when there is decrease of fare
                          from 1.09 to 0.88, no one appreciate...</p>
              <p>As for senior citizens wise, that is the PTC decision.. and
                          whether PAP will lose these senior citizens's vote or not, i cant
                          say. My parents are also senior citizens and they are do affected
                          by this increase... I am just telling you the example of increase
                          in transfer rebates only and nothing else, which we cant change the
                          facts that the price is already changed... unless you dun take bus
                          or mrt..</p>
              <p>and i am not working in PTC/SBST and i am taking public
                          transport as well. I am do affected by the increase in direct
                          fare....what i am mentioning is all about the increase in transfer
                          rebates which caused in this so called increase of fare right
                          now...</p>
              <p>when PTC increase the fare in 2008 with increase in rebates,
                          they still kenna a lot of complain...when in actual fact, many
                          trips involving transfer are incurring less fares.</p>
              <p>So imagine if they keep the transfer rebates as 25 cents from
                          2008 to now, the price that you will be paying as follows:</p>
              <p>2008 - before increase in fare - 67 cents + 42cents = 109
                          cents<br> 2008-2009(after increase in fare) -- 71 cents + 46 cents = 117
                          cents<br> 2009- June 2010 - 69 cents + 44 cents = 113 cents (not 88
                          cents)<br> from July 2010 onwards - 101 cents (5.6 km)</p>
              <p>so it is wrong for PTC to increase the rebates from 25 cts to 40
                          cts to 50 cts then.they should just keep it as 25 cents till June
                          2010, so that they can go claim that the fare involving transfer
                          have indeed DECREASE.</p>

              <p>I have read your post more than carefully and I understand what is 
                          the point you are trying to drive across.</p>
              <p>Firstly, you've are 
                          trying very hard to point out that for that particular trip 
                          (43/70/76-&gt;90) the fares had decreased from $1.09 in 2007, to $1.02 
                          in 2008 and $0.88 in 2009. I get your point loud and clear. Thanks to 
                          your elaboration in the first paragraph, I don't have to type what 
                          you've typed to explain what I was saying in the previous post. The 
                          reason why I said you were doing selective statistical comparison and 
                          that you took the priciest fares is because for that particular trip, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you
                           chose 2007 fares (as opposed to fares from other years) as a basis for 
                          comparison</span>. As far as that trip is concerned, it would be the 
                          priciest in 2007 because it was $1.09 (as opposed to $1.02 in 08 or 
                          $0.88 in 09) What you are doing, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>accentuating</strong></span> <em>the 
                          fare decrease</em> for that particular trip concerned. Though in 2007, 
                          the starting fares is 67¢ and in 2008, 71¢, it is irrelevant here. 
                          Because what I am talking about is the fares for that particular trip 
                          (ie. 43/70/76-&gt;90) is the priciest in the 2007 example you've listed 
                          previously. Get it??</p>
              <p>Next, let me again reemphasise that I get 
                          what you are saying with your irrelevant examples. You are saying "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if</strong></span> PTC did not", "so <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>imagine</strong></span>",
                           etc. These examples, esp those you quote 2008-2009 117¢ &amp; 2009-2010
                           113¢ are merely prices that you extrapolated, that you concluded with 
                          the false assumption that if transfer rebates did not increase, direct 
                          fares will still increase in the same magnitude throughout all those 
                          years. Do take note that you are basing your arguments on deductions and
                           hypotheses, not based on facts here. The reason why fares rose across 
                          fare bands in 2008 is because it was used to cover the increase in 
                          transfer rebate. That is a fact. Period. Like I said previously: the 
                          loss in revenue due to the increase in transfer rebates from 25¢-40¢ in 
                          2008 is fully covered by the fare hike across fare bands, which affects 
                          EVERYONE. There is no loss of revenue incurred by the bus companies in 
                          this sense; in fact, there is an increase in revenue because the revenue
                           gained by increase in fares across all fare bands is greater than the 
                          loss of revenue due to the increment of transfer rebate. You said "when 
                          PTC increase the fare in 2008 with increase 
                          in rebates,
                          they still kenna a lot of complain...when in actual fact, many
                          trips involving transfer are incurring less fares." Now do you see why 
                          are there still a lot of complaints? For the many trips that involves 
                          transfer that see a reduction in fares, there are MORE trips that do not
                           involve transfer and hence see an increase in fares. See the BIG 
                          picture instead of harping on the specifics.</p>
              <p>The reason why no one (or rather, you should say not many people)
                           appreciated the fare decrease from $1.09 to $1.02 is because only a 
                          handful of people who took certain transfers will benefit marginally. 
                          The majority of them experienced a fare hike. How to appreciate? (Check 
                          out the stats yourself) Even if it had benefited me in that case, the 
                          savings in fares would have been happily returned to the bus companies 
                          by the increase in other direct bus journeys that I take! You've to 
                          understand the BIG PICTURE. Surely 43/70/76-&gt;90 is not the only trip I
                           take!</p>
              <p>The only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span> fare decrease (not any sort of fare 
                          increase masquerading as a "fare decrease") they had was in 2009. Reason
                           was because the economy wasn't doing well, and the revenue of the 
                          transport companies remained high. Though they are profit-maximising 
                          companies, they shouldn't be always earning more and more at the expense
                           of the citizenry (or commuters in general)! (I am not even talking 
                          about making a loss here) Do note that there is an increasing trend in 
                          their revenue, coupled with an increasing trend in bus fares throughtout
                           the years prior to 2009. (And btw, I personally welcomed the fare 
                          decrease, though it was rather minimal)</p>
              <p>I disagree with you that PTC is wrong in increasing the fare 
                          rebates from 25¢-50¢. In fact, I think it's a very smart move. Because 
                          they increased the fare rebates from 25¢-40¢, they now have a very good 
                          excuse to raise all the fares across all fare bands, and earn more as a 
                          result. Also, people who do not analyse deeply enough, who do not see 
                          the big picture, will be thinking, like you: Hmm.. the fare rebates have
                           increased... that's good news! Unfortunately, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you have failed to see
                           beyond that superficial decrease in transfer rebates</span>, that 
                          transport fees, as a whole, has increased.</p>
              <p>Right, so you aren't 
                          working in the transport companies and you take public transport and 
                          your bus fares has risen as a result of the implementation of distance 
                          fares. Your parents have been adversely affected too. (If I got you 
                          correctly) Hopefully you aren't a shareholder, if not your words won't 
                          hold much weight here. It's good that such people exist because it 
                          allows bus companies to raise fares more easily, knowing that people 
                          like you will not see past the surface and will be always appreciative 
                          of the transport operators, no matter how poorly they've performed. (So 
                          long as they don't perform worse than Mumbai, Jakarta, Bangkok, 
                          Johannesburg, etc etc <em>can already lah</em>) To this, I have nothing to
                           say - as a fellow commuter, I shake my head with resignation.</p>
              <p>I 
                          don't know why you mentioned about PAP here. This is not speakers'

                          politics / political party in any way - they are not, in my opinion, linked.</p>
              <p>Lastly,
                           let me repost my previous first paragraph because I felt you did not read my post properly in the first place;because if you don't, you can argue until the cows come home and it'd still be

                                                  we want to compare to? When feeder fares were 
                          still 25¢? When
                                                  policemen were still wearing shorts?); (2) That 
                          would be digressing
                                                  from the very purpose of my post, and the topic 
                          (Distance Fares) in
                                                  the first place.</em></p>
              <p>Now, I pray you've 
                          understood why I posted in the first place and think more deeply before 
                          you make another irrelevant retaliatory remark. Good night.</p>

              <p>Your explanations are pretty clear but the rebate increases are
                  actually reluctant, considering the public anger at the relentless
                  price hikes. And from late 2008 onwards the Lehmann bros crisis
                  came, it was inevitable that SBS had to increase the rebates in
                  view of many Sgporeans facing hardships. So it wouldnt be really
                  right to say that SBS was wrong to have increased the rebates
                  because it wasn't an option at all.</p>
              <p>The rebate crap is just a cushion such that the transport
                  operators need not permanently reduce prices at all.</p>

              <p>In 2007/8, they raised the transfer rebates from 25¢-40¢ and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">raised the fares across all fare bands at the same time</span> (eg. 67¢-71¢, etc etc). On the whole, they aren't making a loss at all; in fact, their total revenue increased! So clever of them hor? :D</p>
