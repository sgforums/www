              <p>thank you for the reply.  imagine having to go through all these tabulations just for one trip to save 20cts.</p>
              <p>frankly, how many people know to switch buses 3-4 times like you suggested.</p>
              <p>if this stupid system is here to stay they should come up with a software everybody can use.  all we need is to enter the boarding and eventual location and the software recommends the cheapest route.</p>

              <p>frankly speaking very few people know the art of transferring and saving on their travelling fares when they commute. Most singaporeans like direct journeys and hate to transfer unless necessary. LTA want to encourage transfers but I guess this will take a long while for Singaporeans to wake up their idea that taking direct journeys will cost them alot more and what they do after that is to complain and not find a solution for themselves to save when there's actually solutions around the transport system for them to do so.</p>
              <p>I think the software will not be anywhere intelligent enough to capture the shortest route but now with DBTF I dont think its as good as I think it is.</p>
              <p>Just for example from Lor 8 Toa Payoh to Jurong Point. They gave the feeder to Braddell/Toa Payoh MRT then MRT direct to Boon Lay, while a cheaper route is a bus to Trellis Towers at Jln Toa Payoh, 154 to Clementi MRT and then the train.</p>
              <p>So next time if you need directions it might just be better to ask in this forum than asking the journey planner.</p>

              <p><br>as in?</p>
              <p>The system will eventually evolve. Seriously the old system heavily penalises those who really need to transfer where there's no direct sv.</p>
              <p>I've said before the fare stage remaining fare band you cannot claim for e next ride, e distance fare you can.</p>
              <p>1 example, from Trellis Twr &gt; Toa Payoh Int/ MRT &gt; Bishan Stn</p>
              <p>Old: $0.69 + $0.71 - $0.50 = $0.90.</p>
              <p>New: $0.71 + $0.00 = $0.71.</p>
              <p>In such case, the MRT ride is free because your distance is less than 3.2km. In e past you still have to pay for e new trip.</p>
              <p>It's obvious those taking long distance direct bus are heavily penalised. Simply because if one would notice, the farther distance fares are using the basis bus - MRT or bus - bus transfer scenario.</p>

              <p>The system will eventually evolve. Seriously the old system heavily penalises those who really need to transfer where there's no direct sv.</p>
              <p>I've said before the fare stage remaining fare band you cannot claim for e next ride, e distance fare you can.</p>
              <p>1 example, from Trellis Twr &gt; Toa Payoh Int/ MRT &gt; Bishan Stn</p>
              <p>Old: $0.69 + $0.71 - $0.50 = $0.90.</p>
              <p>New: $0.71 + $0.00 = $0.71.</p>
              <p>In such case, the MRT ride is free because your distance is less than 3.2km. In e past you still have to pay for e new trip.</p>
              <p>It's obvious those taking long distance direct bus are heavily penalised. Simply because if one would notice, the farther distance fares are using the basis bus - MRT or bus - bus transfer scenario.</p>

              <p>do you really believe they introduced such a complicated system just for the sake of the long distance travellers?</p>

              <p><br>dun forget w/ more MRT lines being operational, it's likely ppl would need to x-fer bus - MRT mode. Even I forsee bus - bus interchange would become common as well.</p>
              <p>It isn't complicated seriously, it's only doing away w/ km for MRT, fare stage for bus fare tabulation by combining them together.</p>
              <p>but there's e teething problem of getting used to e fact bus fares are now using km based as like MRT for these 23 yrs.</p>
