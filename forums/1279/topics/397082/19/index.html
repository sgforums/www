              <p>No problems.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I do know many people who have had to pay much more even if they appear to benefit, because the fare stages discriminated against bus companies to try to offer first fare band (4.0 fare stages) for most passengers to make a convenient short trip transfer.</p>
              <p>A notable example is the one quoted on newspaper, where commuters now have to pay 6.2km worth of fare (for actual mileage) from Kranji MRT to JB CIQ, up from the token 3.2km offered to passengers coming from Kranji MRT. The corresponding fare hike is an outright 40¢ for cash-paying passengers, and benefits from a free rides to a fare hike of as high as 35¢ if prior distance travelled is less than 3.2km.</p>
              <p>Some of the services flagged for huge disparity between stage-based fares and distance-based fares are Services 155, 852 and 854, if you were following the thread earlier on.</p>

              <p>talking about the fares involving transfer, i think it is wrong for PTC
              to increase the transfer rebate from 2008 first from 25 cents to 40 cents and then to 50 cents.... they should have remove the rebates of 25 cents only now, so that people can realise the benefit of this so called removal of rebates...</p>

              <p>Hello sbst275, let me tell you in detail how this distance fares
              has benefited me:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Previously:</strong></span></p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>43/70/76: Tai Seng Christian Church --&gt; opp Tai Seng MRT
              ($0.69)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>90: aft Upp Paya Lebar Road --&gt; St Aero ($0.19)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Total: $0.88</p>
              <p>2. From work:</p>
              <p>90: St Aero -&gt; opp Block 1022 ($0.69) + 43/70/76: Tai Seng
              MRT --&gt; Blk 214 ($0.19)</p>
              <p>Fares = $0.88</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now, with the
              "cheaper" distance fares:</strong></span></p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>76-&gt;90 = 5.6km = $1.01 (+0.13 / <strong>+14.8%</strong>)</p>
              <p>43/70-&gt;90=6.2km=$1.01 (+0.13 / <strong>+14.8%</strong>)</p>
              <p>2. Back:</p>
              <p>90-&gt;76 = 3km+3.1km = 6.1km</p>
              <p>New Fares= $1.01 (+0.13 / <strong>+14.8%</strong>)</p>
              <p>90-&gt;70/43 = 3km+3.6km=6.6km</p>
              <p>New Fares=$1.09 (+0.18 / <strong>+ 20.5%</strong>)</p>
              <p>Hello, and I make a transfer, mind you. The distance fares is
              supposed to eradicate transfer penalty (and thus benefiting
              commuters who do transfers). How come with the eradication of the
              transfer penalty I end up paying so much more?</p>
              <p>Not convinced? Let me quote you with another transfer
              example:</p>
              <p>Scenario: Tai Seng Church-&gt;Kembangan MRT</p>
              <p>Previous:0.91(43/70/76)+0.18(MRT) = $1.09</p>
              <p>Current: $1.15 (+0.06)</p>
              <p>I pity the senior citizens the most; instead of having their
              fares tied to the lowest fare bands. Now their fares are
              euphemistically said to be 25% cheaper than the adult fares, capped
              at 7.2km, when in actual fact their fares have been obscenely
              hiked.</p>
              <p>Let me just blindly list one eg. (amongst the numerous
              egs/combinations that I can think of)</p>
              <p>Newton MRT -&gt; Serangoon MRT</p>
              <p>Previous fares: $0.73</p>
              <p>Current fares: $0.97 (+$0.24 / <strong>+32.9%</strong>)</p>
              <p>Just look at the percentage increase! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you take a direct bus, your fees will most probably go
              up:</p>
              <p>Eg.</p>
              <p>136 from Tai Seng Church -&gt; Edgefield Plains or vice
              versa.</p>
              <p>Previous: $1.11</p>
              <p>Now: $1.15 (+0.04)</p>
              <p>Therefore, with the aforementioned examples, I can't help but to
              conclude that distance fares has benefited me tremendously in terms
              of helping to keep my wallet light.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>have nothing much to say about the direct bus fares though... cos like what tamago have said, SBST have try to give benefit to passengers in the past, when passengers are suppose to pay higher fare with higher fare band, but SBST choose to keep it in lower fare band instead by making the fare stages lesser. so all the while, a lot of passengers are paying less as well. but it seem like no one go complain about it also when they pay less.</p>
              <p>as for the example given involving Sv76/70/43 --&gt; sv90, if PTC have not increase the rebates from 25 cents to 50 cents from 2008-2009, the scenario will be as follows:</p>
              <p>based on 2008 price (before increase).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>43/70/76: Tai Seng Christian Church --&gt; opp Tai Seng MRT
              ($0.67)</p>
              <p>90: aft Upp Paya Lebar Road --&gt; St Aero ($0.42) (base on fares of 0.67 and rebates of 25 cents)</p>
              <p>Total: $1.09</p>
              <p>based on 2009 price (as per given by Gohby).</p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>43/70/76: Tai Seng Christian Church --&gt; opp Tai Seng MRT
              ($0.69)</p>
              <p>90: aft Upp Paya Lebar Road --&gt; St Aero ($0.19)</p>
              <p>Total: $0.88</p>
              <p>compare to S$1.01 now....so when people benefit in 2009 when he/she pay S$0.88 instead of S$1.09, no one come out and praise PTC or SBST, but still complain about fare decrease of 2 cents in 2009 is so little or what. Why cant SBST/PTC reduce the fare last year by 4 cents or 10 cents...</p>
              <p>all the while, a lot of people forget about the increase of rebates from 25 cents to 50 cents from 2008-2009. So PTC is wrong to increase the rebates that time. If they just remain it as 25 cents till now, there wont be so much outcry... there might still be certain example whereby fares might be higher... but do compare to the 2008 price also if want to make true comparison.</p>

              <p>I don't know if this has been mentioned in the previous pages, and I don't want to spend time checking the past pages now, but with distance fares now, if we want to make a journey (for example, change of plans or there's some emergency) when we are outside and we have just alighted from the bus or MRT, there is no way to check or confirm our fare. In a certain sense, it's like just tapping your card and hoping for the best.</p>
              <p>One thing I'd like to confirm though. If one has a bus pass and takes the MRT after a bus journey, will the MRT fare be calculated as part of the distance fare or will it be calculated as a separate journey? Likewise for MRT pass and taking a bus.</p>

              <p>No problems.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I do know many people who have had to pay much more even
              if they appear to benefit, because the fare stages discriminated
              against bus companies to try to offer first fare band (4.0 fare
              stages) for most passengers to make a convenient short trip
              transfer.</p>
              <p>A notable example is the one quoted on newspaper, where
              commuters now have to pay 6.2km worth of fare (for actual mileage)
              from Kranji MRT to JB CIQ, up from the token 3.2km offered to
              passengers coming from Kranji MRT. The corresponding fare hike is
              an outright 40¢ for cash-paying passengers, and benefits from a
              free rides to a fare hike of as high as 35¢ if prior distance
              travelled is less than 3.2km.</p>
              <p>Some of the services flagged for huge disparity between
              stage-based fares and distance-based fares are Services 155, 852
              and 854, if you were following the thread earlier on.</p>

              <p>There must be some who really save on their journeys who but it also seems there are many more who have to pay a higher fare. It would be interesting to see from the SBS annual report the collected revenue since dist based fare was introduced.</p>
              <p>Like dragg said, no need to introduce expensive technology if really want to benefit commuters. Just reduce the price. There must be some scholar up there itching for a promotion, doing his best to serve his political masters and entrenching his position, while at the same time forgetting that our bus service is for the people.</p>

              <p>have nothing much to say about the direct bus fares though...
                          cos like what tamago have said, SBST have try to give benefit to
                          passengers in the past, when passengers are suppose to pay higher
                          fare with higher fare band, but SBST choose to keep it in lower
                          fare band instead by making the fare stages lesser. so all the
                          while, a lot of passengers are paying less as well. but it seem
                          like no one go complain about it also when they pay less.</p>
              <p>as for the example given involving Sv76/70/43 --&gt; sv90, if
                          PTC have not increase the rebates from 25 cents to 50 cents from
                          2008-2009, the scenario will be as follows:</p>
              <p>based on 2008 price (before increase).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>43/70/76: Tai Seng Christian Church --&gt; opp Tai Seng MRT
                          ($0.67)</p>
              <p>90: aft Upp Paya Lebar Road --&gt; St Aero ($0.42) (base on
                          fares of 0.67 and rebates of 25 cents)</p>
              <p>Total: $1.09</p>
              <p>based on 2009 price (as per given by Gohby).</p>
              <p>1. To work:</p>
              <p>43/70/76: Tai Seng Christian Church --&gt; opp Tai Seng MRT
                          ($0.69)</p>
              <p>90: aft Upp Paya Lebar Road --&gt; St Aero ($0.19)</p>
              <p>Total: $0.88</p>
              <p>compare to S$1.01 now....so when people benefit in 2009 when
                          he/she pay S$0.88 instead of S$1.09, no one come out and praise PTC
                          or SBST, but still complain about fare decrease of 2 cents in 2009
                          is so little or what. Why cant SBST/PTC reduce the fare last year
                          by 4 cents or 10 cents...</p>
              <p>all the while, a lot of people forget about the increase of
                          rebates from 25 cents to 50 cents from 2008-2009. So PTC is wrong
                          to increase the rebates that time. If they just remain it as 25
                          cents till now, there wont be so much outcry... there might still
                          be certain example whereby fares might be higher... but do compare
                          to the 2008 price also if want to make true comparison.</p>

              <p>You are entirely missing the crux of my post. The purpose of my post is to objectively and clearly point out that my fares has risen, by a significant extent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this time round</span>. It was not meant to be a historical comparison of prices because: (1): There is no end to such historical comparison of prices (How far back do we want to compare to? When feeder fares were still 25¢? When policemen were still wearing shorts?); (2) That would be digressing from the very purpose of my post, and the topic (Distance Fares) in the first place.</p>
              <p>Hmm.. you are using Oct 07-Oct 08 prices. Why? In 2007/8, though there was a bus hike where all the bus fares across all fare bands increased, people taking this bus journey (43/70/76-&gt;90) will benefit because they increased the transfer rebate from 25¢-40¢. In a sense, you are doing selective statistical comparison here.  Incidentally (or purposefully), the 2008 fares are the priciest for that 
                          particular bus journey.</p>
              <p>Why did you say in order to make a <strong>true</strong> comparison, take 2008 fares? Why can't I take 2009/07/06/05/04/03/02/01, etc etc etc where fares, as a whole, are lower as the<strong> true </strong>comparison? Kindly justify.</p>
              <p>Evidently, you neglected the fact that when the transfer rebates rose from 25¢-40¢ in Oct 08, fares across ALL fare bands increased! That increase affected EVERYONE (though some will still benefit because of the increase in transfer rebates), it was reported that it's a fare hike. Hence, the increase of transfer rebates from 25¢-40¢ is NOT a blessing engendered by the bus companies; it's merely a transfer of revenue sources, for the revenue lost from this increase had been shrewdly incorporated in the increase of basic fares.</p>
              <p>What about other fares that went uncommented? The senior citizen fares? According to your "true" comparison, the increment of senior citizen fares is even greater! Direct journeys lagi worse (as you've acknowledged).</p>
              <p>I may be wrong, but from the way you crafted your post, the way you seemed so deferential towards SBST/PTC (such as thanking them for the subjective increase in rebates), you come across to me as someone with vested interests - are you working for SBST/SMRT, or a shareholder? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> If you are neither, you can consider being either of the two.</p>
              <p>Above all, let me reiterate that the point of my post is to show that people who do transfers may not benefit from distance fares, which is widely purported to benefit them in the first place. Senior Citizens, as whole, will also suffer. Adults taking direct journeys will suffer. Period.</p>

              <p>Oh sorry for that :(</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14.4px;">Fares will be higher per km if
              they were calculated in this manner, and the fare you pay under
              displacement-based fare will be roughly the same as distance-based
              fare.</span></p>
              <p>And it incentivises bus companies to not use express routes
              whose displacement of the 2 bus stops far away might be much less
              than that of distance required to reach there. A closer distance
              between 2 bus stops will become preferred as they don't seem to
              "lose" that much.</p>

              <p>hmm but i think displacement-based is more fair. the tpy and yishun issues as stated. besides, express routes usually are relatively straight so dont really think that it will affect it too much. just my 2c haha</p>
