              <p>Just because some here take direct journey so say a scam. So others who benefitted is wat?</p>
              <p>Last time say x-fer bus expensive, so now make it total distance (6km bus + 11km MRT = 17km MRT ride fare) also complain.</p>
              <p>In any case here complain. But where's your journey (pt A to pt B) to prove?</p>

              <p>you think their revenue will be lower just because of the examples you tabulated?</p>
              <p>i am sure those people arent so stupid as to introduce a system where we can tabulate and not find any cheaper trips.  as i said earlier there are bound to be cheaper trips and pricier trips.</p>
              <p>the issue is which is more. there is no way to know as their are millions of variations.  frankly only the transport companies know as they have the statistics and datas.</p>
              <p>there are a few points that work to their advantage;</p>
              <p>the 71cts (2 or 3 cts increase) for all feeder services. </p>
              <p>the removal of the 25cts rebate for transfers. </p>
              <p>most people wont tabulate the charges before they travel.  thats äººçš„å¿ƒç�†. </p>
              <p>if you forget to tap on exit they charge maximum.</p>

              transfer journey from Serangoon Gardens to Queensway will increase by
              11 per cent from $1.50 to $1.67, and a feeder bus journey will increase

              <p>He also said: "With such huge increase in profits, what is the justification for the

              <p>if they travel such far distances as from east to west already need to transfer one bus or MRT and pay 69¢+69¢-50¢=88¢. thus they save 2¢ if their journey requires a change from/to MRT, or from/to bus.</p>

              <p>I assure you he's a regular commuter like you and I. Apart from all the extra fares which I had to fork out for certain straight-forward rides e.g. Ang Mo Kio to Yishun, it is cheaper for me to run to town to grab something and commute back, as long as I'm using different mode or bus service number for the return leg.</p>
              <p>I once did a Novena-CCK-Funan by taking the MRT first and then Sv 190. The whole ride cost me $1.94. Under old fare system it'd cost me $1.62+$1.50-$0.50=$2.62. I did the round knowing that I can travel all I can within 2 hours and pay $1.94 if I confine myself to trunk/feeder/NSL/EWL/LRT services.</p>
