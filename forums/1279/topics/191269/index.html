Its those BCs on standby...they only know of their routes 5-10mins before. So if they don't know the route, they will follow another BC to learn the route...meaning there will be no bus for that slot during that period.<br><br>For example:<br>Sv183 shift 3A has 8 trips on the timesheet. The replacement BC will learn the route by taking the 4A bus while leaving his own bus parked at the int. He will then drive the remaining 6 trips on his own (and pray that he doesn't go the wrong way).<br><br>There are 2 types of standby BCs.<br>1) BCs with no fixed route. They can be rostered to do any service.<br>2) BCs that are not rostered. They will wait at the int/depot to replace any BCs that fail to turn up.</div>
