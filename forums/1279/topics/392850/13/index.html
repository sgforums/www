              <p>SIX double-decker buses, worth about $3 million, went up in flames at the Ang Mo Kio bus depot Sunday morning.</p>
              <p>Bus
              drivers arriving for work at the depot along Ang Mo Kio Street 63 were
              confronted by the acrid smell of smoke, and the burnt-out shells of the
              smouldering half-dozen buses.</p>
              <p>'There were so many
              policemen and firemen around. I was shocked to hear that six buses had
              been burned...this is the first time I have seen anything like this,'
              said one 44-year-old bus driver, who arrived around 5.30am.</p>
              <p>The
              Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) is currently investigating the
              cause of the fire, though it is not known at this point if someone
              deliberately set fire to vehicles, estimated to be about $500,000 each.</p>
              <p>The
              SCDF added that the fire was contained within the six buses, as the
              rest of the fleet were parked farther away. A security guard on duty
              raised the alarm. No one was hurt.</p>
              <p>To ensure the
              morning services were not disrupted, buses were redeployed from other
              depots. The six buses all plied the No.25 route from Ang Mo Kio
              interchange to Bedok interchange. A spokesman for SBS Transit told The
              Straits Times that the loss of the buses will have 'some impact' on
              day-to-day operations, but that it would try to minimise inconvenience
              to its commuters by redeploying buses where possible.</p>

              investigating the cause of the fire, though it is not known at this
              point if someone deliberately set fire to vehicles, estimated to be
              about $500,000 each.</p>
              <p>The SCDF added that the fire was contained within the six buses,
              as the rest of the fleet were parked farther away. A security guard
              on duty raised the alarm. No one was hurt.</p>
              <p>To ensure the morning services were not disrupted, buses were
              redeployed from other depots. The six buses all plied the No.25
              route from Ang Mo Kio interchange to Bedok interchange. A spokesman
              for SBS Transit told The Straits Times that the loss of the buses
              will have 'some impact' on day-to-day operations, but that it would
              try to minimise inconvenience to its commuters by redeploying buses
              where possible.</p>

              <p>Most fire actually started from electrical faults. Many people dont follow electrical safety. One example is my work place. Fridge faulty, tripped main power. But they keep switching it back on, until a loud "POMP" sound is heard. No idea what happened. No smoke seen.</p>
              <p>An article here shows how even a SIMPLE electrical product can spark a fire:</p>

              <p>SBS9888Y is special to everyone of us, bus enthusiasts. But well, it cant be brought back to life if she's really destined to go heaven earlier. Just move on from there! I'm sure she will lead a better life up there! Even if the world did unjustice to her by having her EDS removed, and now lead her to death.. I'm sure she will be well somewhere up there! :D RIP SBS9888Y! ä¸€è·¯èµ°å¥½ï¼Œè°¢è°¢ä½ ï¼�</p>

              <p>When 8074 crashed SBST skipped registering new buses ending with 4.</p>
              <p>Now that 7440 burned down, next thing you know SBST will never register a new bus with a '4' in it.</p>
