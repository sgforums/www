              <p>And have a few  bus mechanic to check the buses that
              return to the deport at night for sign of engine over
              heating and also inspect the electrical part of all
              the buses especially the old buses every week for defect. </p>
              <p>And also park all the new buses to one side and old
              buses another side of the deport to pervent heavy damange
              to new buses in case of fire, at least the old have one or two
              years on the road the cost of replacing them is less compare to the

              <p>Park new buses to one side to prevent heavy damage to new buses? What if the new buses caught fire? then all the new buses gone?

              <p>Yeah depots around the world have the similar format. A company cannot spend so much money to isolate buses from each other, let alone the cost against such an unpredictable incident. Buses do not go booms everyday in the company.</p>

              What if the new buses caught fire? then all the new buses gone?
              Also, what do you mean by cost of replacing old bus is less than
              cost of replacing new buses? So if old buses is burn, go buy an old
              bus to replace? you still have to buy a new bus right? So how do

              <p>Well, a new bus on the road have bring in a less income as of yet. A old bus which served SBST for a few years certainly has let the company earned some income of it. So the earned income can be used to cover the cost of a new bus.</p>

              <p>it makes sense in accrual accounting terms since the salvage value of an older bus will be lower than that of a newer one.</p>

              <p>SIX double-decker buses, worth about $3 million, went up in flames at the Ang Mo Kio bus depot Sunday morning.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers arriving for work at the depot along Ang Mo Kio Street 63 were confronted by the acrid smell of smoke, and the burnt-out shells of the smouldering half-dozen buses.</p>
              <p>'There were so many policemen and firemen around. I was shocked to hear that six buses had been burned...this is the first time I have seen anything like this,' said one 44-year-old bus driver, who arrived around 5.30am.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) is currently investigating the cause of the fire, though it is not known at this point if someone deliberately set fire to vehicles, estimated to be about $500,000 each.</p>
              <p>The SCDF added that the fire was contained within the six buses, as the rest of the fleet were parked farther away. A security guard on duty raised the alarm. No one was hurt.</p>
              <p>To ensure the morning services were not disrupted, buses were redeployed from other depots. The six buses all plied the No.25 route from Ang Mo Kio interchange to Bedok interchange. A spokesman for SBS Transit told The Straits Times that the loss of the buses will have 'some impact' on day-to-day operations, but that it would try to minimise inconvenience to its commuters by redeploying buses where possible.</p>
