              <p><strong>BUS TENDERS TO BENEFIT RIDERS</strong></p>
              <p>In about a year's time, the Government will take the first baby step towards liberalising the duopolistic public transport market, now controlled by SBS Transit and SMRT Corp.</p>
              <div class="story_text">
              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA), which will assume the role of central route planner, is expected to put up the first parcel of bus routes for tender by the second half of next year. Previously, the two incumbents planned their own routes.</p>
              <p>The idea is to keep operators on their toes by introducing a system that will make them compete for the market, so as to better serve commuters.</p>
              <p>Currently, the two incumbents do not compete directly. In fact, one could say they do not compete at all as they ply different routes. If there is any overlap, it is negligible.</p>
              <p>They operate under the watch of the LTA and the Public Transport Council. Even so, the Government feels standards could be improved if competition is introduced.</p>
              <p>Details of how the market will be opened up are still being worked out, but the burning question being asked now is: Will the commuter be better off?</p>

              <p>Limit the number of players to <strong>3 </strong>at most. Having too many players will cause the system to collapse since SG is too small. It is not a metropolis like London or Melbourne.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, let one more operator in, then watch over all the players and make sure they do a good job.</p>
              <p>Competing head-on is not the solution, but mutual cooperation is.</p>

              <p><br> so who have got S$100 million to spare and lend to the bus fans? If not, just lend S$10 million to me also can..:)</p>
              <p>not that easy to be a new operator... Each bus cost S$360 000. So imagine u bid for 5 routes (as a package) and each route need 10 buses. So you need at least 50 new buses x S$360 000 = S$18 000 000 )excluding SP). and some bus fan even talk about give 1 min or 2 mins frequency for certain services.. Who is going to loan you this amount if you are a newcomer with no financial backing? unless another temasek linked company come in or foreign company? But then i dun think any foreign company want to come in when our own transport company have been expanding overseas. If woodland transports or other local bus companies wish to come in, they will have to buy new WAB buses and cant use their existing bus fleets, which does not meet the LTA requirement at all.</p>
              <p>still need to talk about depot space to park the buses? manpower to operate /maintain the buses etc etc  etc?</p>
              <p>TIBS was started without much working capital as well and it is the Japan bus manufacturer (Hino?) who agree to sell the bus to TIBS first ,and let TIBS pay back later when they got the money.</p>

              <p>Don't underestimate any new operators. Look at the taxi market. We
              have about double the operators and they have decent financial backing.
              Who knows, someone might really go with the idea of higher frequencies
              with shorter buses, maybe 7m Dart SLF or Hino Ribbon.</p>

              <p>Bro Taxis different la,4.5 Sonatas price is the same as a Scania KUB.Taxi companies earn from the Taxi driver itself where the bus company is not.I dun really think that a third company would improvise to a better standard.Expand fleets,Manpower and possibly depot could do just fine.Listen to the seniors here,They got more knowledge.</p>

              <p><br>thing is, if you're have a bigger fleet, you've more flexibility over deployment and maybe cheaper to buy them under bulk purchase</p>
              <p>furthermore investment in bigger buses needs big capital, hence even if those private operators are interested, they might not be up to e beat for heavy demand routes yet they're not interested in non profitable routes</p>

              <p>there is this article in the Sunday Times today regarding the upcoming bus tenders. The article is isnt complete in the straits time website. Can read through the sunday times for more details of this article.

              <p><strong>BUS TENDERS TO BENEFIT RIDERS</strong></p>
              <p>In about a year's time, the Government will take the first baby step towards liberalising the duopolistic public transport market, now controlled by SBS Transit and SMRT Corp.</p>
              <div>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA), which will assume the role of central route planner, is expected to put up the first parcel of bus routes for tender by the second half of next year. Previously, the two incumbents planned their own routes.</p>
              <p>The idea is to <span style="color: #ff0000;">keep operators on their toes</span> by introducing a system that will make them compete for the market, so as to better serve commuters.</p>
              <p>Currently, the two incumbents do not compete directly. In fact, one could say they do not compete at all as they ply different routes. If there is any overlap, it is negligible.</p>
              <p>They operate under the watch of the LTA and the Public Transport Council. Even so, the Government feels standards could be improved if competition is introduced.</p>
              <p>Details of how the market will be opened up are still being worked out, but the burning question being asked now is: Will the commuter be better off?</p>

              <p>Keep companies on their toes? How so?</p>
              <p>If they have to abide by LTA's weelies and neelies then what's there to compete? So to speak? You can't do much to keep companies on their toes by making them offer homogeneous products.....</p>
              <p>So what now?</p>
              <p>First come first serve? Is that the way to "compete"?</p>
