            <div class='col-md body'>which was not even INTENDED to be used during boarding ?<br><br>I'm posting this in the buses section hoping to get more information from you people.<br><br>I've replaced my ez-link card couple of times as they always spoilt, i don't know the exact cause but i think it got damaged somewhere in my wallet when it's pressed by other things in my wallet over time.<br>But i could always get it replaced free at the office.<br><br>A day before this incident happened, i boarded a bus and got no response from both card readers at the entrance, so i knew my card died again, and it would mean a lot trouble to me when taking public transport especially digging for coins and getting standard tickets for trains which is at adult price i think ? (I'm using a secondary/pre u card thus i have concession)<br><br>I didn't have time to go for card replacement on that day and next (anyway it was already at night when i discovered my card couldn't use anymore)<br>Meant i have to use cash (coins) when taking buses.<br><br>The next day, i paid 55 cents when boarding. The SBS BC requested my card for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verification only</span>.<br>I showed him, he asked me to try tap. As expected, no response, i also told him i knew my card was spoilt already.<br><br>He just took the card away from me and printed an inspector ticket along with a white card saying my card got retained and i have to call a hotline AFTER 5 WORKING DAYS!<br><br>I had to alight a few stops later i didn't have time to check what the hell he gave me and to argue with him. Here's the start of the problem, i don't see any reason why he had to retain my card?<br><br>I would be MORE than happy to pay an adult fare (it isn't much difference for 4 bus stops) if i knew there would be so much trouble and dis-convenience for me.<br><br>Look, if he hadn't retain my card, i could actually get my card replace the next following day WITHOUT hassle.<br><br>Now because he retained the card ( on 22/5/07 ), i got to wait for SBS Transit to receive the card from the BC and maybe look into it before they mail it to TransitLink HQ, which only then i can get a replacement.<br>It's a lot trouble finding coins and to get standard ticket each time i want to take train, ESPECIALLY when the train is already arriving and i had no choice but to wait for another one because getting the standard ticket isn't fast!<br><br>I'm not whining here. I just like to hear your views, was the BC right?<br><br>Just after that incident, i called both SBS Transit and TransitLink. they told me that BCs have the rights to retain card for investigation if it's found to be tampered with, misused, replaced etc..<br>Well that made sense, BUT it has got nothing to do with my case! Why did the BC bother so much about my card? I paid my fare, i showed him the verification he wanted!<br><br>I may write to SBS but i like to know first of all now, was he doing a right thing or more like being a 'kpo'?<br><br>[/u]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm quite fed up with this stupid rule that BCs are allowed to retain cards.  It's getting ridiculous at times.  Most of the people who are normally affected are those using concession passes.  And the reply given by the relevant authorities in The Straits Times today isn't at all pleasing.  They are KING, like it or not.  If they want to do something, they can always explain that it's some term or conditions blah blah blah.  They are the ones setting the rules, not us.<br><br>Next time you encounter this problem, and you know there's a problem with your card, just pay cash.  If the driver ask you to tap your card, you do not need to.  Just say you don't have money in the card.  Or just say you prefer paying cash.  The bus driver has the right to retain your card, but he doesn't have the right to insist that you tap your card.  So if you know have problems with your card, do not tap it.  Pay cash.  If they want to see your card, let them see, but do not tap it.  As long as you paid cash and fare, even if it ends up with the police coming down, you are not at the losing end as you did not commit any crime.<br><br>And if you want to piss the bus driver off, take your time to put one coin in at a time.  If he cannot wait and moves off, pretend to fall down.  That will scare him quite a bit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you shud treasure the experience of being able to get the special tix and familiarising yourself with the procedures. I think it would be very very rare or impossible that an adult ezlink would be confiscated. Something that you could do is to thank the BC after he confiscates your card <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He may think u r mad or get a shock which i think you will be satisfied with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

(I'm using a secondary/pre u card thus i have concession)<br><br>I didn't have time to go for card replacement on that day and next (anyway it was already at night when i discovered my card couldn't use anymore)<br>Meant i have to use cash (coins) when taking buses.<br><br>The next day, i paid 55 cents when boarding. The SBS BC requested my card for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">verification only</span>.<br>I showed him, he asked me to try tap. As expected, no response, i also told him i knew my card was spoilt already.<br><br>He just took the card away from me and printed an inspector ticket along with a white card saying my card got retained and i have to call a hotline AFTER 5 WORKING DAYS!<br><br>I had to alight a few stops later i didn't have time to check what the hell he gave me and to argue with him. Here's the start of the problem, i don't see any reason why he had to retain my card?<br><br>I would be MORE than happy to pay an adult fare (it isn't much difference for 4 bus stops) if i knew there would be so much trouble and dis-convenience for me.<br><br>Look, if he hadn't retain my card, i could actually get my card replace the next following day WITHOUT hassle.<br><br>Now because he retained the card ( on 22/5/07 ), i got to wait for SBS Transit to receive the card from the BC and maybe look into it before they mail it to TransitLink HQ, which only then i can get a replacement.<br>It's a lot trouble finding coins and to get standard ticket each time i want to take train, ESPECIALLY when the train is already arriving and i had no choice but to wait for another one because getting the standard ticket isn't fast!<br><br>I'm not whining here. I just like to hear your views, was the BC right?<br><br>Just after that incident, i called both SBS Transit and TransitLink. they told me that BCs have the rights to retain card for investigation if it's found to be tampered with, misused, replaced etc..<br>Well that made sense, BUT it has got nothing to do with my case! Why did the BC bother so much about my card? I paid my fare, i showed him the verification he wanted!<br><br>I may write to SBS but i like to know first of all now, was he doing a right thing or more like being a 'kpo'?<br><br>[/u]</div></blockquote>i have been involved in a similar incident when i took SBS9819Y on 143. That bloody BC. He had an attitude problem. I got a replacement card for like 1 mth. and say i ADULT (i got sec skool/pre-u card, thus got concession) He force me to pay 90cent and also ez link card. (Cos i wanted to collect SBS9819Y's ticket) I complained to SBST, but response came like 5 weeks later. i suppose the BC that detained your card is a brbp/amdep/bndep/slbp one (These buggers from these depots love to irritate pple). I suppose the BC who got punched comes under one of these bus depots lah. Thats why if you noticed the complaints on SBSTs website are those mostly on amdep/brbp services. (Like 8, 138,143 [Mine,wouldnt really count]....)<br><br>I remember some old post saying that one of the SGForum members got card confiscated by a Service 65 BC. Pardon me from being biased, i find most of the BCs on 65 alright except for 1 guy (i wouldnt describe) from the arbp side (the SBS9441C regular) and 1 from the bndep side (the SBS9448J regular [Last time]).<br><br>I may be a huge arbp fan. but i DO NOT support arbp 14.<br><br>These (mostly) arbp 14 BCs check passes all the time. so be prepared to have an unpleasant journey with any BC from 14 (esp with VO3x batch 1 and MK2s [took SBS1704Y on 14] . The BC drive like crazy. SO SO SO many arbp 14 drivers checked my pass. Screw them.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
