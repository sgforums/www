In addition when Jurong interchange existed , I remembered 196 had O305 for a period of time before LO 2 axles came in when 196 was rerouted to Boon Lay as the jurong interchange was closed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>High time to start a museum of old but working commercial vehicles here !<br>Like the Daimler-Benz museum in Germany where the old even vintage models are all still working ones, taken out on rides now &amp; then.<br><br>What can be done is to take back some old models, overhaul them &amp; re-use them occasionally for short distance leisure trips, targetting mainly @ tourists &amp; others who want back some old memories &amp; rides ! I won't mind being such a regular customer for such a service ! They can keep least 1 unit of all the old models used here so that people have variety &amp; can compare how well the models ranks amongst themselves &amp; even the current newer ones around, to see if old have to be not better than new or vice-versa.<br><br>The M-B O 305 is no doubt a very technically advanced model compared with the Leylands, whether Atantean or Olympian @ the time even some years later !<br><br>I believe initially those with Alexander double-deck bodies came with engine encapsulation, which was later removed, exposing the oil sump &amp; the external noise levels then increased somewhat, though still quieter than the lousy junky Atantean bough around the same times.<br><br>The (air, in an era where most here only still used springs) suspension ride comfort is 1st class, although more wavy on the upper floor but i'll still maintain is not inferior if not still superior to what you get nowadays on those double-deckers currently here !<br><br>The engine sounded to me like a BMW in-6 cylinder engine in running smoothness when crusing. Only the MAN's came close then &amp; even nowadays in this area. Whatever you hear from the engine is 'real' engine sound unlike the Olympians where much of the 'engine' noises actually comes from the noisy radiator air-intake fan @ the front or the side of the vehicle. I admire though the extent which Leyland or Volvo seemed to have tried to imitate the engine sound of the O 305 by fixing such stupid noisy fans which give some artificial illustion of running smoothness, to try to cover up for the inferior running smoothness of their engines ??<br><br>The original M-B push-button automatic gear came @ the time when Leyland still used their funny jerky lousy pneuo-cyclic gearboxes, which jerked like hell just before moving off &amp; still jerking all the way aferwards ! The M-B units i find gave the best combination between performance &amp; gear change smoothness although the whinning noise was some irritation, but still less than what the ZF &amp; Voith gearboxes emit nowadays !!<br><br>In overview, the O 305 no doubt is among the finest class of citybus ever to exist. The old world style of German engineering does stand the test of time &amp; that's unfortunately where some corners have been cut in the newer models<br>later ! In many ways old can be better than new, whether in comparison among the same make or even with other makes which came later !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by seancannot:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyone can tell me anymore non-air con Mercedes double deck around which used to ply service 154 ... last time I used to take to Poly.... its my favorite bus ... I wanna take it again<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scrapping a fine class model like O 305 is a stupid waste, if so.<br>It's too advanced a product to be written off so soon.<br><br>If they can keep using a relatively inferior pile of junk like the Volvo B7F somewhere in Ireland (i believe) then no good reason to scrap the O 305 !!<br>As a PSV, the B7F is a flop with the sort of (spring only while O 305 uses air suspension as standard feature !) suspension ride comfort more suited to transport goods than people ! Also the B7F's dashboard's light years behind time in design ergnomics &amp; aesthetics of vintage era even !! The O 305 much more advanced dashboard still carries on to the O 405 &amp; in some direct way, even to the current model the Citaro.<br><br>Re-deployment thus more sensible as i'll even say 25 to 30 years service life for an O 305 is viable.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by IsIsTRD:</div><div class="quote_body">These buses are either scrapped or export to other country. I ever seen one 0305 at Bintan resort sometime in year 1999. Maybe it is one of the earlier batch of buses being deregistered. </div></blockquote></div>
