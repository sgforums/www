            <div class='col-md body'>hseochin,<br><br>The B7Fs are known as B57s, but they have been withdrawn from service in Ireland since 2003.   They were not inferior at all to any of the single deck buses offered at the time.  Leyland and Albion Vikings had tiny motors (400ci) and were manual, and the Mercedes OF1312 and 1413s were also very slow and lacked power.  The OF1417, which was introduced after the B57 had power and was automatic (same gearbox as the B57) as well, but did not have air suspension.  Obviously other companies saw more worth in the B57s, since they all got sold, very few were scrapped.  Vikings are very cheap to maintain, and many are in Fiji.  Of the single deck buses at that time, the B57, OF1417 and Leyland Victory were Kings of the road.  The Atlantean AN68s were built before the O.305.  M.A.Ns come close to a Mercedes only because they use Mercedes components... essentially a poor man's mercedes!  The floor ramped slightly at the back on the top deck, but not noticeably.  They also served on the 22 in their later years, and on the 153.  The 2 axle Leyland Olympians did not have much radiator noise at all.  Fleet ages vary across different states in Australia.  Sydney and Adelaide also have large O.305 fleets still running.  The single deck a/c vehicle you mention is by Jonkheere.  It is not known where the vehicle is now, or what happened to it after running in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why the B7F known as B57 ?? What does the digit 5 mean then ?<br>The nomemclarature doesn't appear consistent to me then.<br><br>In the area of suspension ride comfort, having personally riden on those B7F/B57 many times (@ all seating locations on the bus) i found it simply among the worst if not THE worse in these area, which i consider of supreme importance because it's supposed to be a PSV, not a goods vehicle like a van or truck, where comfort may be secondary !!<br><br>The M-B's of the time like the O 302, O 306, OF 1417, OF 1413 i found all these top class in suspension ride comfort (among spring category, not comparing with air-suspended models) even when seated @ the extreme rear end !!<br>The B7F/B57 i have to place it down @ the bottom end, with the British makes somewhere in between in this area of evaluation. Don't think there was any OF 1312 but even in the case of the LO 1113 the ride comfort was slightly inferior to the OF models (not surprising since 1113 was more truck based than the OF series) but still nowhere as bad as this Volvo's !<br><br>The only positive thing about that Volvo i consider is the engine, being turbocharged with reasonable output for it's capacity &amp; lower noise levels from the engine as such compared to the OF 1417 say, which was particulary noisy, especially with exhaust brake in use !<br><br>Same automatic gearbox ?? Didin't seem so to me because the OF 1417 here used the zig-zag slotted (M-B style type) of selector with round knob while this Volvo used a more conventional T-bar type of selector, similar to that used in the OF 1413's later converted to automatic.<br><br>Leyland Victory i'll say quite victorious for its time due to it's quite potent big capacity 11 litre engine compared to the rest here then. The short finger operated gearshifter seem easy to use &amp; quite smooth in gear changes though  not as smooth as the full automatics the others used. But engine also very noisy &amp; suspension not as comfortable as the M-B O &amp; OF's.<br><br>MAN i'll consider as a 'compromised' M-B i.e. take an M-B cut some corners somewhere then you get a MAN. Like Tata of India, which looks so Mercedes like ! Mercedes is very well imitated everywhere i observe, not surprising given that they are the world's oldest &amp; largest bus &amp; coach maker.<br><br>The Leyland Atlantean didn't have the noisy radiator fan noise but the Leyland Olympian which came since 1987 did have this noisy fan @ the front. Don't  know whether it's Cummins or Leyland themselves who had this noisy fan idea since the 1st Olympians here used Cummings turbocharged engines. Maybe there's few which used Leyland (turbocharged ?) engines &amp; these might not have such noisy fans ?<br><br>So the O 305 with single-deck air-con Jonckeere body was ever deployed in Singapore ? I would have liked to try it !! I expect far better performance to weight ratio than with the double-decker bodies.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">hseochin,<br><br>The B7Fs are known as B57s, but they have been withdrawn from service in Ireland since 2003.

Same for Svc 30. The LO2Xes didn't last long on 146 as it was withdrawn shortly after DDs were introduced. Svc 78 didn't get DDs until late 1998.

Anyway, if we had a LA and an O305, both without badges, we can't tell them apart if we look at the front since both have silver trimming for the windscreen. At least the LO2X has a distinctive front grill in addition to the black trimming on the windscreen.</div>

Don't  know whether it's Cummins or Leyland themselves who had this noisy fan idea since the 1st Olympians here used Cummings turbocharged engines. Maybe there's few which used Leyland (turbocharged ?) engines &amp; these might not have such noisy fans ?<br></div></blockquote>The 2-axle Leyland Olympian were the last true Leyland buses to be built. All used a Leyland TL11 engine and Leyland Hydracyclic automatic transmission. The exception, perhaps, was SBS 3554A which may have used a Cummins engine and an Allison gearbox. Whether Cummins or TL11, all have that loud radiator whine which, to me, is the personality of the Olympian chassis.<br><br>I particularly love the Leyland transmission because of the short pause in between gears. In Singapore, only the Leyland Atlanteans and Olympians did this which makes them unique. That's because, the Hydracyclic, just like the Pneumocyclic, can be configured as a semi-auto or a full auto. All the Olympians is Singapore were configured in the full auto mode but the gearbox still functions as if it was in a semi-auto mode. Hence, the short pause but without the need for the driver to switch gears.</div>
