            <div class='col-md body'>I think i can still differentiate between O 305 &amp; Atantean in that case, because<br>the silver trim on the windscreen for the O 305 was thinner with thicker black rubber lining on both edges. Another less obvious sign is the 2-piece windscreen is less flatly aligned with each other on O 305 i.e. the glass is angled in a  steeper slope meeting @ the centre pillar. Lastly the glass area seemed larger on O 305. If you can see through the windscreen, another hint which is which is the backside of the dashboard i.e. the shape &amp; height are very different.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iveco:</div><div class="quote_body">THe LO2Xes used a different windscreen from the O305s and LAs. Anyway, if we had a LA and an O305, both without badges, we can't tell them apart if we look at the front since both have silver trimming for the windscreen. At least the LO2X has a distinctive front grill in addition to the black trimming on the windscreen.</div></blockquote></div>

The engine sound hints of Cummins whereas most if not all the others i riden on did sound &amp; behave like Leyland in both engine &amp; gearchange characteristics.

My bottom point simply is why the need for the Leyland type of gearbox design when the benefits over the conventional type of automatics don't seem to exist ?<br><br>To me merely having something different for the sake of just being different hardly makes any sense ?! Maybe that's why Leyland 'kaputed' ultimately when Volvo came &amp; took it over, because Leyland couldn't get enough takers for its type of technology/products ?!?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The 2-axle Leyland Olympian were the last true Leyland buses to be built. All used a Leyland TL11 engine and Leyland Hydracyclic automatic transmission. The exception, perhaps, was SBS 3554A which may have used a Cummins engine and an Allison gearbox. Whether Cummins or TL11, all have that loud radiator whine which, to me, is the personality of the Olympian chassis.<br><br>I particularly love the Leyland transmission because of the short pause in between gears. In Singapore, only the Leyland Atlanteans and Olympians did this which makes them unique. That's because, the Hydracyclic, just like the Pneumocyclic, can be configured as a semi-auto or a full auto. All the Olympians is Singapore were configured in the full auto mode but the gearbox still functions as if it was in a semi-auto mode. Hence, the short pause but without the need for the driver to switch gears. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find that the past popularity of Leylands mainly due not to any superior technical capabilities of their vehicles but more to 'politics' of the time whereby Britain &amp; British colonies (like Hong Kong) were 'forced' to buy British, despite the obvious fact that many non-British makes then (now even of course) were superior to the old British junkies ! I believe that if left more to the free market to decide like many of the other makes, Leyland would have disappeared much sooner.<br><br>In theory, i agree that putting the radiator up front can make cooling easier &amp; more direct but then there's been so many buses &amp; coaches over the past 20 years with rear engines yet no radiator up front yet somehow these survive, whether in Europe, Singapore or Brazil etc., so there's tropical as well as cold climates.<br><br>For tranverse rear-engine buses, the Scanias have long existed with radiator even intercooler on the sides in the rear.<br><br>I notice that in the earlier Volvo B10M's, the radiator's up front but the later versions the radiator put along the sides, like most rear engined buses.<br>Unfortunately some such units of B10M's i note also has such noisy fans which sounds so much noisier both inside &amp; outside than the engine itself !<br><br>As for Hydracyclic created in 1975, the O 305 existed since 1967 &amp; the level of engineering like air-suspension &amp; their much smoother &amp; better performing push-button automatic gearbox etc. to me i find it still superior in technical advancement.<br><br>The Olympians are the better lot among Leylands, maybe the National slightly better. But i'll say comparing to non-British makes, these British products are overall still inferior &amp; backward. So the gradual demise of the British automotive industry after WW2 comes as no surprise to me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The Leyland Hydracyclic was created in 1975 and was initially used as a standard component on the Leyland Titan.

            <div class='col-md body'>What lever to control the gears ?? You mean the gear-knob-on-stick type instead of push-button ? On the OF 1417 introduced here around 1980 that type was used. Believe it was Allison 4-speed full automatic.<br><br>I recall riding on i believe was the earliest O 305 in Singapore (with Willowbrooke double-deck body) which was launched here around May 1982. I still keep that 2 full page Straits Times launch ad. put up by Cycle &amp; Carriage which shows the left side view of the O 305. The dashboard was similar to that in the next 200 or so units to be ordered for delivery starting from 1984 to 86 &amp; based on what i saw &amp; also on the gear-change characteristics of the early unit i took on route 165, i'm fairly certain in early 80's era they already used the push-button type of full automatic by M-B for M-B.<br><br>My thinking is that why Leyland used their own type of semi-automatics back then instead of full automatics like M-B, ZF or Allison etc. was due to the lower performance outputs of the largely backward Leyland engines (like those used on Atanteans) they probably figured with semi-automatic the vehicle performance might be slightly better with less 'drag' on their engines i.e. for their type of old engines semi-auto will do as they lack the performance levels of the more modern engines to make optimal use of a full automatic gearbox anyway ! Also in their favour is the possible lower costs of a semi-auto box.<br>In other words, my belief is that if Leyland had better performing engines like the Germans, Swedes etc. then, they would have used the superior full automatics instead. By the way, any other makes of buses/bus-chassi used these Leyland semi-autos ? Very rare i'll say. I wonder if these Leyland boxes were really that fantastic, other makers would dump the more expensive types &amp; queue up &amp; buy from Leyland instead ?? Leyland then most surely would be most happy to sell since then they're not in too good form financially anyway ?<br>But going by history, that didn't seem so.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">The O.305s until 1984 had a lever to control the gears.
