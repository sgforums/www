It can be serious for malaysian coaches because when they fell asleep, the'll accidentally press on the acclerator and they might go up to 120kmh. The result, like one of the Grassland express crash which happened a few years ago. The driver and some of the passengers died.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope you all don't mind I ask some critical questions.<br><br>In the first place do you all have a driving licence? Any class will do.<br><br>I have both 2B,2A,2 &amp; 3. The youngest licence being class3 is 4 years old. My last accident was in mid 2001 in Pasir Gudang at the last corner of the track where I slided off at 110kph on a 250cc. After that I have never crashed any vehicles regardless on road or track.<br><br>When I drive sometimes I close my eyes for a couple of seconds during confident locations in order to maintain my alertness for the rest of the journey. I play track and thus have my own concept of braking &amp; gearing. Some may find it dangerous some feel that it's very stable at least I know what I am doing.<br><br>Even those 'safety' drivers I know get into accidents because they do not know what they are doing. They thought they were being safe but ended up in accidents. How did they do it; I also don't know because I've not crashed for close to 6 years.<br><br>When you claim that the driver was sleepy or suffering from fatigue, did the driver express in the first place that he was sleepy to you? <strong>If he didn't, then it's merely assumptions by the plaintiff in the 1st place</strong>.<br><br>Therefore I really suggest that before making such comments based on groundless assumptions, it is better to think of the consequences of getting the wrong guy into trouble.</div>

HOW sure are you they wud only give him a warning?<br><br>as MS said, have a license 1st and u'll see how it is to drive.... more than 8hrs per day for the rest of your life. some more it's automatic.<br><br>i am gg to driving down PIE frm tampines to jln bahar for another 5 years and i'm only a 10-month old driver. and just 2 hrs' drive is tiring for me. what more about them?<br><br>dont tell me you dont sleep in sch/lectures/tutorials? so guai?</div></blockquote>Maybe i should be more elaborate. Being tired in long hours driving is unavoidable, i understand that( even the truck driving simulator , 18 Wheels of Steel: Convoy, which i played for 2 hrs non-stop driving a "truck" i felt very tired oredi, let alone real driving).<br><br>But what the BC did i think was a mistake. Instead of washing his face to perk him up, he went behind the bus to SLP. Try like this, u wake up in the morning and its still early, you went back to slp, then u woke up again 5mins later, surely you will feel like sleeping again rgt? And u will feel even more tired after the "nap". Maybe a 2hrs nap will be sufficient, but i think a 5min nap will make you feel worse, that's what i think. Everytime when i wake up and its still early and i went back tp slp for another 5-10mins and wake up again, i confirm will slp in class. If i wake up and its still early BUT i never go back to slp and instead wash my face, i would stay awake in class. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> That's what my dad told me, "If you wake up, dont go back to slp, otherwise you will feel even more tired and will slp again".<br><br></div>
