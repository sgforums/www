            <div class='col-md body'><p>MOSCOW, Feb. 22 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- RUSAL (SEHK: 486; EuroNext: RUSAL/RUAL), the world's largest aluminium and alumina producer, announces its key production data for 2009 (Note 1). <br><br>Key highlights <br><br>* Total aluminium output amounted to 3.9 million tonnes in 2009, a <br>reduction of 11% compared to 2008. <br>* Alumina output totaled 7.3 million tonnes in 2009, a decline of 36% as <br>compared to 2008. <br>* Following weakened demand, bauxite production was reduced by 41% to <br>11.3 million tonnes in 2009 as compared to 2008. <br>* Aluminium foil and packaging production volume of about 67.8 thousand <br>tonnes in 2009 remained practically unchanged as compared to 2008. <br>* Assuming growth in demand for aluminium in 2010 as forecast by the <br>experts referred to below, in 2010 RUSAL plans to produce 3% more <br>aluminum and 7% more alumina than in 2009. <br><br>Commenting on the today's announcement, Oleg Deripaska, CEO of RUSAL said: "The past year tested the resilience of the aluminium industry and forced every company to respond to the downturn. RUSAL acted decisively to address the consequences of the global economic downturn and enhanced its long term competitiveness through its cost-cutting programme, successful restructuring of its debt and its share listing on the Hong Kong and NYSE Euronext Paris stock exchanges. We have laid a solid foundation for the further sustainable development of our business. <br><br>We are seeing the first signs of a recovery in demand, as more countries emerge from recession, reflected in an increasing number of orders from our clients in Europe and the U.S. as well as continued economic growth in Asia which encourages our optimism about prospects for the aluminium industry. We believe that the stabilization that is now being seen will lead to consumption growth exceeding the pace of production increases." <br><br>For Total Output in 2009, please visit: http://www.prnasia.com/sa/attachment/2010/02/2010022239588.pdf <br><br>Market analysis (Note 2) <br><br>2009 was one of the toughest years on record for the global economy and commodity markets, including the aluminium industry. According to CRU Group, the global recession resulted in an 8.2% drop in demand for aluminium in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009, the average price for aluminium dropped by 35% compared to 2008. Responding to these negative factors, in 2009, aluminium producers cut annual production by about 2.4 million tonnes and postponed launching new facilities totaling about 3.5 million tonnes a year. Overall, global aluminium production dropped 5.9% as compared to 2008 to 37.8 million tonnes in 2009. <br><br>In 2009, global prices for aluminium and other commodities were supported by the growing Chinese economy, which was aided by a USD 685 billion stimulus programme supporting economic growth through major infrastructure projects and a range of measures to stimulate demand for industrial products, including the automotive industry. According to Brook Hunt, in late 2009, the revival of developed economies initiated restocking throughout the aluminium production chain, further supporting demand. <br><br>Aluminium <br><br>UC RUSAL total attributable aluminium output amounted to 3.946 million tonnes in 2009, a reduction of 11% compared to 2008. The lower volume was in part caused by the temporary suspension of the least cost-efficient smelters, the Novokuznetsk (NkAZ), Bogoslovsk (BAZ) and Urals Aluminium Smelters (UAZ) in Russia and the Zaporozhye Aluminium Smelter (ZALK) in Ukraine. <br><br>For details, please visit: http://www.prnasia.com/sa/attachment/2010/02/20100222627570.pdf <br><br>Alumina <br><br>Total attributable alumina output for UC RUSAL amounted to 7.279 million tonnes in 2009, a decline of 36% as compared to 2008. Production was cut at relatively high cost alumina facilities, such as Aughinish (Ireland) and the Zaporozhye Alumina Refinery (ZALK, Ukraine). Production was temporarily suspended at Eurallumina (Italy), Windalco (Jamaica) and Alpart (Jamaica). <br><br>For details, please visit: http://www.prnasia.com/sa/attachment/2010/02/20100222276070.pdf <br><br>Bauxite <br><br>Due to weakened demand, the Company's overall bauxite production was reduced by 41% to 11.3 million tonnes in 2009 as compared to 2008. <br><br>For details, please visit: http://www.prnasia.com/sa/attachment/2010/02/20100222102772.pdf <br><br>Investment projects <br><br>RUSAL will continue implementing its core investment project -the construction of the Boguchanskaya Hydro Power Plant. The Company is also actively seeking project financing to revive the construction of the Taishet and Boguchansky Aluminium Smelters. <br><br>Outlook for 2010 <br><br>A number of experts are forecasting that 2010 will see considerable growth of the aluminium market generated by rising demand from the automotive and packaging sectors. CRU analysts expect aluminium consumption to grow by 12.6% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Positive dynamics are expected to be driven primarily by continued economic development in China and India due to growing urbanization. Demand for aluminium is also expected to be supported by the major developed countries as the global economy revives. <br><br>Assuming the gradual restoration of the market in 2010, RUSAL plans to increase production of aluminium by 3% in 2010, compared to 2009. The increase is expected to include an increase in production at the Siberian plants, Alscon (Nigeria), KUBAL (Sweden) and potline 5 at the Irkutsk Aluminium Smelter (IrkAZ) in Russia reaching its full production capacity. <br><br>On the basis of the same assumption, RUSAL expects to increase alumina output by 7% in 2010 compared to 2009, by stabilisation of alumina production at the Achinsk Alumina Refinery (AGK), Bogoslovsk (BAZ) and Urals Aluminium Smelters (UAZ) as well as restoring production at the Boksitogorsk Alumina Refinery (BGZ) in Russia and Aughinish Alumina Refinery in Ireland. <br><br>Note 1: The figures disclosed in the announcement are unaudited and <br>therefore may differ from the audited figures <br>Note 2: Source: CRU Group (unless otherwise stated) <br><br>ABOUT RUSAL <br><br>RUSAL (http://www.rusal.com ) is the world's largest producer of aluminium, in 2008 accounting for approximately 11% and 13% of global production of aluminium and alumina, respectively.
