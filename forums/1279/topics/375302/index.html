              <p>Just want to know, The DDU shows colours and sound that points out whther the bus is late or early. For example, A sharp beep means that the bus is early and the DDU will show a red light. No light = On Time. Long beep + Yellow light = Late.</p>

              <p>anyway what she did was that she smiled at the passengers boarding and acted in a very friendly way to the pax. when i dropped my things other bcs normally dont bother, but this one took the effort to turn back and ask if everything was alright the next time the bus stopped. she really made the effort here.</p>

              <p>its a she lol.</p>
              <p>anyway what she did was that she smiled at the passengers
              boarding and acted in a very friendly way to the pax. when i
              dropped my things other bcs normally dont bother, but this one took
              the effort to turn back and ask if everything was alright the next
              time the bus stopped. she really made the effort here.</p>

              <p>Well, a few of the Svc 900 SLs are kinda patient. A few of them
              would actually wait for you if you they see you running at the void
              deck towards their bus. At least commuters don't have to start
              their day with a bad mood because they missed their bus ... ...</p>

              <p>Well, allow me to share some of my experiences as a passenger, that did not happen today but made my day. Not listed in order. Sorry it's super wordy.</p>
              <p>I usually take 961 to WRI everyday to go to school. There was this time, earlier in February this year, I boarded TIB431Y. I was almost late for school, and I knew he was a PRC SL, but I was so panicked that I asked him, "What time you reach Woodlands (prnounced wood-lan to him)?". He said "Woodlan? Seven-forty". I was quite surprised, and thanked him, and he smiled at me. From that day onwards, I have no prejudice towards PRC SLs as they are here for a living, and they are to make the best out of it. That really made my day. This particular PRC SL on 961 is the friendliest one I met. I only noticed recently that henever passengers board his bus, he smiles and bows at them, which I think is friendly and warming. Regretted not sending a commendationb about him.</p>
              <p>Another experience occured back last year. When I boarded 61, there was this time I was asking people in the bus for change for cash, because I have no more money in my EZ-link card. After like 2 minutes of finding someone with the correct change, when I put my fare in the coinbox, I said "sorry, thanks for waiting" and he said "It's ok". That made my day, because he didn't rush me to pay for the trip.</p>
              <p>Another experience is related to one of my SL friends who used to be from 970, then a standby and now a permanent SL of a service from Woodlands (not trying to be biased or anything here). This is not really about an incident. Though this particular SL is not like those who greets passengers when they board, he does certain things that many drivers fail to do. One thing is that he waits for the elderly to sit down before he drives his bus off from the bus bay. This shows that though he is pressed for time, at least he doesn't fail to take note of the passengers safety. He also would check to see if everybody has tapped their EZ-Link card, and sometimes would make people who haven't tapped to tap again. Most passengers dislike this, but the drivers have to make sure that there are no fare cheats. I rarely see other drivers doing this, and I must commend him on taking the trouble to do so. More important than those two, when the bus is packed to the brim, he looks through the mirrors to see if there is space. If there are people who are not moving back, he'll shout "Excuse, me, please move in. Thank you!". We've been complaining so long about people not co-operating and taking the initiative to move in when we are standing, so I am glad that even some drivers have the guts to raise their voice and tell others to move in so that more people can board the bus. These kinds of duties are somewhat uneccesary of bus drivers, but it makes my day (and mostly everybody else's day too), because we know they are putting in the effort in doing their job best.</p>
