              <p><br> There are some like the last bus of Service 030 from Boon Lay Int,
              0020 which will reache Bedok Int after 1 AM. But still, when you
              want to get back home, you will still have to take the respective
              SMRT NR avaliable at that particular heartland to town, then take
              the NR/Niteowl back home. Unless you do the spotting at
              where you are residing in.</p>

              <p>Yes yes very correct.  It depnds on where you live as well for example if you live along bedok nth Rd, besides some nite owls, and NR7 u have the bonus EBs. (assume they're from BNDEP )<br><br>as u progress along u gain exp and be able to guage if there is a EB to call at bus stop</p>
              <p>For example if u see a BC waiting at a bus stop at say 330am, ah u know a EB will turn up and stop there. Definitely get ready ur camera to snap.</p>
              <p>EB shots r rare to come by. i myself have yet to snap one prefect shot as they stop fast go fast like F1 car in  a pit stop fast. just recnelty i managed a up down hand shake shot of a EB32. its clear but the poor bus became 2 images of a bus..lol<br><br>The same applies for WT ( Worker transport)  of SMRT. Very hard to snap. I once had a WT 5 draw up behind my NR 7 ( my NR7 has this full rear ad plastered over the rear window). Guess what i did...Without thinking i removed the rear NR7 desto. poked my camera right through the tiny space of clear glass. the NR7 bus i was in then stopps at a traffic light.</p>
              <p>the WT  SL managed to spot my camera. in a good gesture, he drew up behind the NR7 abbout 0.7 m away. and he stopped just nice for me to get a full frontal shot. Not too close , not too far. I was pretty lucky to get the shot but thru the glass its kinda fuzzy.</p>

              <p>i use a compact like most of the bus fans who can;t aford a DSLR. dun intend to upgrade to that bulkt piece of object. I like my objects small.

              <p>17 and below (i.e. JC1/Poly1) after 11pm. But, uh yeah, you can probably give excuses like 'I'm on my way home from a movie...' and stuff...not encouraging it d'oh. Anyway, it's more like they'll take down your IC, call your parents and stuff...and it doesn't matter if you're in a group or not, although I feel that they'd target people in a group more because when you're in a group, you're more likely to do ridiculous things outside as opposed to when you're alone (i.e. you're probably on your way home or something...)</p>

              Spotting. I did heard from sources that people below 18 years old
              who stay out alone after midnight will get caught by the
              police. Is that true?</p>

              <p>There is no law that states that youths below the age of 18 cannot stay out late at night. I am sure that the police got more better things to do than catching youths who stay out late. This is Singapore. NOT North Korea.</p>

              <p><br>  For me is the same wishing process, but I might wait for 2 or 3 buses to go pass if I have time, or I would just settle for a perm even though how much I don't like the bus. And on an additional note it would be very rare for me to chase after the bus. So far I only chased when 595H was on 911, 1039R and 1049L. Nothing more</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>my style of bus spotting is to go a bus stop near to my home everyday when it goin to peak hours soon, most of the times i use handphone to note down the cameos. i dun really like using paper and pen to note down because i find it very pek chek, as most of the times i just stand and sometimes sit. i stand how to use pen and write? use another hand as a table to hold the paper ah? if i do that at public, i find it quite pai seh. somemore i not only lookout for the buses that is coming to my bus stop, even i had to lookout for buses approaching at opposite direction. whenever there is cameo that is spotted for consecutive days, i try to lookout for the perm stickers above BC seat. usually, if we do bus spotting everyday, we can know which buses are approaching at any directions of a road in a specific timing. if rare cameo comes, i will took a pic for it. sometimes i bring a paper with all regos of each bus services and symbols whether they have ads such info near my home, so in case i not sure, i can use it as an aid.</p></div>

              <p>My style of bus spottign is actually joyriding, collecting service guides from buses, taking the buses in a full trip, and taking down the buses you take.</p>
              <p>Of course, I do take down cameos, but not tryign to waste time to stand at a hot bus stop with direct sunlight to you, but at my balcony taking down cameos on the bus services which passes by my house. I love super rare cameos, I remember one time i saw the cameo, SBS2618G, as i was walking down to the bus stop, but there was a T-plate in front, so i cannot take.I wait and wait then a 293 with no T-plate come then i go tution, When i came out of tution class, i ran and took SBS629M, then SBS2618G.</p>
              <p>I am always like this, I can hack care anything, time, money, just to do something i like to do.</p>
              <p>So if you see me outside, as ben has saw me on a Leyland cameoing on svc 28 but i did not regonise his face, do get me.I am always holding onto a paper or nothing turning my hand like a imaginary steering wheel.</p>
