              <p>Bus Spotting to me..</p>
              <p><br>Is to spot bus the old-school way. What do we mean by that ? <br>It actually means that we (or rather i) would try to spot bus without having any prior knowledge of where the bus is. Try to spot the bus at 1 location while waiting for the bus (ur target) to appear. Sad to say, this old-school way of bus spotting is no longer being popular anyway. People are always relying too much on technology these days. Although this is the most time-wasting way of spotting a bus but the joy or satisfaction at the end of the day is at its best.</p>

              <p>I had post this without seeing any other posts</p>
              <p>anyway, first thanks to 9816E for creating this thread.</p>
              <p>Bus spotting means to me in these few aspects.</p>
              <p><strong>Spot rare cameos</strong>: It is meant in the word sense as really rare that would not be found previously or it would be only once in a blue moon that that would really occur. For example, a DM3500 on a 225 maybe rare to some people whom never venture to Bedok before and only studied the fleet of 225 in great detail in sgwiki, however, the starter of BNDEP often allowed dm3500 to cameo on 225, therefore, it could not be termed as rare. However, each of the examples given could be considered rare.</p>
              <p>SBS 997 A (HGDEP 62) on 11</p>
              <p>SBS 9888 Y(AMDEP 25) on 192</p>
              <p><strong>Take photographs</strong>: I will generally take pictures of odd destos or odd happening in buses such as a desto which features fonts not the same as others and some odd happenings maybe for example a emergency hammer slot without the emergency hammer or a bus that are meant for an advertisement becomes completely vandilised. However, it is also meant to include, but not only limited to, taking pictures of general buses without any special aspects in them.</p>
              <p><strong>Joyriding</strong>. Joyriding could be only be called joyriding when I take the bus to various interchanges and terminals without any motive and just plain enjoyment of the bus and also in some cases, evaluating the bus in term of its suspension, accerlation, pick up, and air con. generally, I would most welcome joyrides that are on DM3500, B9TL, VO3X batch 1 (93XX series).</p>
              <p><strong>Researching on buses.</strong> I would generally research general aspects of the bus such as gearbox and date of commisioning on the bus, it would be done online at sgwiki or reputable sites or at the Lee Kong Chain Refrence Library Level 11 (RSING 388.88).</p>
              <p>In this term, i would also like to emphasize the need of professional bus spotting.</p>
              <p>1. Do not shout and run like a freak when you see a rare bus, if I see people running around with a camera and taking a photographs of the bus, i would generally knew that he/she had the same hobby as I. However, general public may not seem to understand the significance of the act. they would think that we are a group of mad people taking buses.</p>
              <p>2. If you would like to take service guides, take just enough to create a collection. Think of others, when they needed to go to locations, they depends on the guides greatly. While we could know most of the routes by hard, not most public could.</p>
              <p>Overall, I would like to conclude in my own view that bus spotting is general intrest in  buses, deployments and many more aspects but in order to be a good and responsble bus enthusiastist, we need to think of other and practice basic manners and responsiblity on buses.</p>

              <p>hi all</p>
              <p>I agree with some of you all shd look out of the box. Below i try to explain what i think is bus spotting<br><br>Bus spoting in a particular country is when you go to that country and sample each and every model of bus it has. if you are a citybus enthusiast like me then you can just choose to sit every model of city bus the fine city has to offer. For example: i aim to take alll if not most models of  city (municipal registered) bus in Say Brisbane Australia by 2017. this paragraph defines the purest form of a bus spotter as defined in wikipedia. It just means the bus spotter realy thrives on his sense of discovery and the sense of fulfilment when u actually manage to baord, take pix or get a tix from a foreign model of bus that u really wished to sit // snap / get a tix.<br><br>So bus spotting activities could be to seek out (capture by photo or sit the bus or collect bus tix) of each and every bus of a certain make. For Eg: i have completed taking all Scania n113CRB in Singapore by May 2004. Spottinga ALL bus by make/model in a particualr city is another form of bus spotting.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, bus spoters do not care about network coverage, connectivity or timetbales of bus. i mean screw it, if the MAN 10.220 HOCl midi bus  i want on Svc 134 in say some suburbs  Greece is 1 hour long, i jolly well wait one hour to sit and then enjoy my catch, the MAn midi bus on sub urban svc 134. lol</p>
              <p>Bus spotters spend much time outdoors with notepads (i dun like HPs coz u can lose 'em) , monitoring bus
                      routes or in Singapore context, monitoring cameos.,. Some bus spotters like me may be more biased to vintage vehicles like sit some atleantans overseas etc. Other bus spotters may simply just like Articulated buses and go bounces on them jointed buses. on the other specturm some bus spotters love thier modern WAb buses and simply love to sit brand new buses.</p>
              <p>Bus spotters like to keep abreast with bus news. For Singapore context, definitely deploymnts of buses. Many bus spotters take photographs and/or ride on buses.<br>Some bus spotters may actually be transport enthusaists. Buses and trains go hand in hand in most cities. I note that because i myself do not mind checking out trams and trolleybuses or trains in other countries, and defintiely i am gian with ticketting machines and train gates and even station architecture and art. There is a word for people like me. I indulge in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Metrophile" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrophile">metrophily</a></p>
              <p>The most pure-blood form of a bus enthusiast is when he is not just interested in buses (vehicles) but also how the operations of a bus company is done and fleet management or even scheduling.<br><br>Bus spotters also like to have 'fan charters' by chartering a bus of
                      choice and get photos of it in different parts of the city they
                      are in. Bus spotters also like special livery of buses and in Singapore context, ads that really blow our eyes out and minds out. I know some of us here love the Jolly Shandy ads on B9TLs..come on admit it.</p>
              <p>So where can u find bus spotters? n Singapore anywhere. When visiting other countires keep to places with lots of people flow for safety and secutiry. That means train stations bus stations, bus stands or simply a busy intersection or along a busy city road. Of cuz if u are in a busy area full of bus, you won't find it tough to get some nice shots and perhaps a ride on these buses.</p>
              <p>Recent global trends show that bus photographers tend to really picky about sunlight directiona and how the bus is well exposed in full sunlight. Reckon in my opinion is down to Canon SLRs that really need light to work well. Nevertheless,, I myelf am guilty of always looking for perfect sunlight direction. But in tree and lamposted Singapore, seems tough to find such spots. Reckon will be much easier in the outdoors in other countries.</p>

              <p>OLD SCHOOL<br><br>As an extension to my above, erm thesis (lols)</p>
              <p>I shall bring old school bus spotting to the global context.</p>
              <p>Defnitely like old school Singapore bus spotting, u shall need luck. But even so without any prior research into what buses you want, you won't know that u have reached the end of your discovery journey. So some research into the background of how bus company operates say in brisbane is still essentiall</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if u had chossen a rather busy cuty road and all bus models go there (ur research shos that)  spot in say brisbane, ask yourself...will the buses come. here is where luck comes into play. And defintiely cammp , be patient and wait.</p>
              <p>Although this is the most time-wasting way
                                      of spotting abuses overseas but the joy or satisfaction at the end of the day
                                      is at its best. (u will notice this is lifted from SBS-Boy's post, of course on purpose to stress thhis impt point)</p>

              <p><strong>Take photographs</strong>: I will generally take
              pictures of odd destos or odd happening in buses such as a desto

              not only limited to, taking pictures of general buses without any
              special aspects in them.</p>
              <p><strong>Joyriding</strong>. Joyriding could be only be called
              joyriding when I take the bus to various interchanges and terminals
              without any motive and just plain enjoyment of the bus and also in
              some cases, evaluating the bus in term of its suspension,
              accerlation, pick up, and air con. generally, I would most welcome
              joyrides that are on DM3500, B9TL, VO3X batch 1 (93XX series).</p>
              <p><strong>Researching on buses.</strong> I would generally
              research general aspects of the bus such as gearbox and date of
              commisioning on the bus, it would be done online at sgwiki or
              reputable sites or at the Lee Kong Chain Refrence Library Level 11
              (RSING 388.88).</p>
              <p>In this term, i would also like to emphasize the need of
              professional bus spotting.</p>
              <p>1. Do not shout and run like a freak when you see a rare bus, if
              I see people running around with a camera and taking a photographs
              of the bus, i would generally knew that he/she had the same hobby
              as I. However, general public may not seem to understand the
              significance of the act. they would think that we are a group of
              mad people taking buses.</p>
              <p>2. If you would like to take service guides, take just enough to
              create a collection. Think of others, when they needed to go to
              locations, they depends on the guides greatly. While we could know
              most of the routes by hard, not most public could.</p>
              <p>Overall, I would like to conclude in my own view that bus
              spotting is general intrest in  buses, deployments and many
              more aspects but in order to be a good and responsble bus
              enthusiastist, we need to think of other and practice basic manners
              and responsiblity on buses.</p>

              <p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, to me BUSSPOTTING is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) A leisure hobby:</p>
              <p>I tend to take busspotting as a hobby. I go around looking for something to discover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) A sidetrack stress reliever:</p>
              <p>Everytime i want to go to a library or tution for studies, i will always take buses to reach my destination or go back home by bus. At the same time, i would look out the windows and spot cameos or look at something interesting. Somesort of multi-tasking in my opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, when i have something on at one particular area, like for example; Tution in Chua Chu Kang, i would go and find a joyride if i have time before or after the appointment. Usually, in this case, Sv 975 joyride on weekends or Sv 925 joyride on weekdays.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) An oppurtunity to express another hobby:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe some of you guys know that i am quite a shot in professional, abstract photography. With busspotting, i would be able to experiment different angles and settings to get that good shot. One example is during NE Shows. I go and find places at night to photograph buses which are on chartered for NE Show.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I run my own Youtube Channel that covers buses in Singapore. So, i take busspoting as an oppurtunity to let the public know about the latest happenings in buses. I think most know that i was the first one to release a video on Youtube of SBS8031J and SMB1H on it's first day of service. I do take videos of buses to let others 'step into my shoes' as i film a special bus for example and have my audieunce enjoy the ride with me. I hope you get what i mean here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) An oppurtunity to break away</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, i think this is almost as same as point 2 but this is slightly different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i meant by 'break away' is to break away from my hectic schedule and think of things that is haunting my personal life and answer my own questions on human behaviour. I have the tendency of acting 'emo' in buses due to these problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also take time off to chat with some of my BC friends who are driving. I may chat with them on some things or just drop by to have a joyride on their bus. This is also what i meant by 'break away'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, all in all, this is what i think of busspotting. Maybe it's a mordern way of busspotting in my opinion.</p>

              <p>You should know that you are being targeted. Sometimes things are not worth bothering with. They enjoy your reaction, so if you don't react, it'll stop soon enough.</p>
