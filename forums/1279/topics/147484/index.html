            <div class='col-md body'>Adults don't dream unrealistically.  I am not saying you don't have a right to dream.  Sure you do.  In a nutshell, what I am saying is 'Be realistic'.<br><br>And if you look at it this way, it's advice, isn't it.  Concentrate on your studies first.  Get that qualifications, get the necessary experience, and being a CEO requires immense maturity and ability to work under pressure.  Hence I am not talking rubbish.  It's probably sound advice most adults would give.  And of course, there are so many graduates with MBA and work experience who are fighting for the same job.  It's a competitive environment out there.<br><br>Does it make more sense to you right now?  It seems that you too need to get my point before replying.<br><br>And before you accuse me of criticising people in public, maybe you could examine yourself.  You made a critical comment on gorby107's knowledge of buses.  So who are you to tell me off?  You do not even practise what you preach.  So save it.<br><br>Please also don't assume what I think or what I feel.  You are not God, nor a psychiatrist or psychologist.  I think I know myself better than you do.<br><br>I don't know why you maligned me for starting a war when I am speaking the truth.  I see no harm in speaking the truth.  It's only when you speak the truth, then other parties will have a chance to grow.
