This has nothing to do with journalism.  I call this being plain busybody, that's all.<br><br>Have you heard things such as product launch parties?  Journalists are also invited to such parties to do write up on such events.  Usually it's the company who will issue the invities, press release and product information to the media.  This is the offficial avenue, and it should be respected.  Would you like to have your product press released unofficially before you?  Put yourself in the company's shoes.  If you are so ignorant and unknowledgeable in the marketing and business, I suggest you shut up and retire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright maybe we can calm this down by talking about it in another thread. Maybe a thread for any new signs of services or other new bus activities spotted. Something similar to "off-topic" but bus related.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While we all cool our heels, why don't we simply acknowledge that the whole thing about 43 was simply a false alarm, and maybe we should have listened to CSS302T.  We do not know what has caused the postponement, and none of my sources can provide me a reason.  All we can do is speculate that it may just be a shortage of vehicles, as originally warned.<br><br>Finally, all we can do now is wait for press releases and not jump the gun.  I hope it is a lesson for everyone to post things ONLY as a rumour, and not FACT.<br><br>I will not be closing the thread, because I think that this is something everyone should know about.  I will let the thread run its course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay okay, please stop!!<br><br>I agree with windy, lets just be patient and wait for the actual press release to come and show some respect to the bus company.<br><br>Tamago: I truely understand the excitement of blurting out "insider information" to others. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. However, you must really be wise... I believe those senior members are concerned about you. Hence they are trying to hinder you from divulging any more information.  If you really feel that this is crap, then i am really very apologetic.<br><br>Apart form that, peace please. =)</div>
