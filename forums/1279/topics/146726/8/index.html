            <div class='col-md body'>iveco,<br><br>Yes, but the problem was that there was a proposed Mk V chassis, and the fact that the info was on this forum, readily available to the public, led to a Volvo rep emailing me about whether there were any B10M Mk V's in Singapore, because it was only proposed.  If the chassis did exist, IIRC, it would have meant that either a leak happened, and any of the plants produced a chassis to the wrong specs, or it was stolen.  Either way, heads at Volvo would have rolled unneccessarily, because of a few kids who couldn't be bothered calling them what they are known now.  One needs to consider the ramifications of posting here, which is what we are trying to change here.<br><br>At the same time, the B12M was already released, it could have been a B12M chassis with the 9.6L engine instead, which would mean a different dash, different components, a kneeling mechanism, etc.  We just don't know.</div>

I am not attempting to gag you or anything like that.  However, I would like to point out to you (as I have done in private conversations), that certain things are not meant to be posted on certain forums, because they are on the public domain.  This is why we have time after time asked you to keep such information to yourself, to the other closed membership forums, and not your blog, or any forums where the public can easily gain access.  You have known the reasons, and the case in point is the Volvo B10M Mk V case I mentioned earlier.  You know how much trouble we can potentially get into, and not only that, but if such rumour becomes unfounded, it puts the whole bus enthusiast community in bad light.  There is no glory in being the first to post coveted information, it is only a trophy which lasts for about 2 minutes before it is forgotten.  While I urge you to not retire from buses in general, I do ask that you do exercise more discretion in the information you distribute, and consider the ramifications should such information be put on the public domain.  If you wish to take this further, please, PM me.<br><br>As for the forum, it may probably be better closed, because of past mismanagement, which I know was due to circumstance, rather than laziness.  However, I am going to try to clean it up, even if it is an uphill battle.  The thing I worry about is that the public see the bus enthusiast community in this forum, but not in the closed membership forums, and this is giving everyone a bad name.  Guilt by association?  Yes.  Why should I be frowned upon when I go about my hobby in Singapore because of someone else's indiscretion?  Who's to say that we are banned from taking photos in interchanges because of the actions of other enthusiasts who cannot control themselves?  What about the disrespect some members have shown to public resources?  How does that reflect upon all of us?  Why should I and other more senior members of the community suffer for what the newer and in some ways less mature members have done?  Again, the culture which is rife is the whole "I want to do this for me, and I don't care what happens further down the track".  I want this rear desto, and I don't care if I get caught.  I want this poster, because I want it for my collection.  I don't care if the public do not benefit, there are posters everywhere.  How was this culture born?  It wasn't me as a moderator at the time.<br><br>Again, I hope you do understand these words, because others have tried to change you.  Whether they stated the same reasons, I don't know, but maybe this may convince you to think before you post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">Ah. Personal. You want to have this bus forum closed and since the owner is retiring you want to piss everyone who is posting here off to a new forum and removing all references to the new services to make the forum unimportant. You want to keep privileged information to your group of forums and denying rival groups and juniors whom you deem childish an advantage.<br><br>You failed to get SBST's support 'cos you do not understand how to create a win-win situation for yourself and the company. Instead of raising the profile of the community and the sport, you are terrorising people away.<br><br>Since I was comtemplating retirement and you put your word in such stark terms, suggesting that I'll spoil your grand plan if I don't, then you may have your way. I will continue to do my research and post it on my blog. :0</div></blockquote>Look, if you want to behave in a childish manner go ahead.  There is certain protocol to observe.  This is a public domain forums.  You don't go posting internal company info.  Will you post information from the various govt departments over here?  Will you like it if I post your personal information here for everyone to know?<br><br>Look, SBST doesn't need us to hype up their services.  SBST is not some shoe or apparel company for e.g. that depends on hype to introduce new products.  And even for apparel and shoe companies, they also have product launch shows and sneak previews to generate hype.  Do you think SBST needs such kind of sneak preview and stuff?  I don't think so.  The notices will appear at the relevant bus stops, that's enough.  Transportation is a necessity and need, not a luxury.  Hype or no hype, you will still use it.  Once again, I suggest that if you have so much time on your hands (I don't know how you manage to get that time...ask yourself...i dun wanna post it out), why don't you generate hype for the Citybuzz services instead?<br><br>Well, as for raising the profile of the community?  Well, if you stop acting like an idiot and observing protocol, then perhaps the profile of the community could be raised.  Hey, I don't want to be sued or warned by SBST for releasing info ahead of them.  It's a two way thing.  If you want them to trust us, show that we can be trusted.  And if you want them to respect us, we have to earn their respect.  And the respect is that we do not overshadow the host (in this case it is SBST).<br><br>And if you insist on leaking info to the public, I might have to report you to the relevant authorities.  And even I don't, someone else will.  This is the last warning to you.<br></div>
