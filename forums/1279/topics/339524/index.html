              </p><p class="MsoNormal">On 05 December 2008 at 7:11pm (the EZ Link machine stated
              8:11:55HRS), I boarded TIBS Bus Number 861P as always. And upon finding a seat,
              the bus captain immediately stood up, turned around and stared at me
              accusingly. He then next pointed at me without saying a single word and
              immediately pointed back to the EZ Link machine repeatedly. And for the entire
              journey, I was really angry at being embarrassed and humiliated in this manner
              and the bus captain didn’t offer an apology upon knowing that I had tapped my
              card and duly paid my fares like everyone else. Although throughout the trip, I
              had considered asking for his name to lodge a formal complaint, I decided not
              to do so and decided to ask him directly what was going on.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I understand that bus captains have their duties at hand,
              whether is it in checking and making sure that passengers paid their fares or
              if their passengers moved to the back of the bus to allow other boarding
              passengers to board and things like that. But what happened next really left me
              feeling disgusted with this bus captain’s attitude and aggressive behavior
              towards me.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just before I reached my intended stop, I went up to him and
              ask what exactly was going on and he simply feigned ignorance. When I
              questioned him on why did he have to humiliate and embarrass me in front of so
              many passengers even though I paid my fare, he started to raise his voice at me
              and claimed that he never humiliate me at all. So I explained to him that he
              just pointed at me accusingly and at the EZ Link machine and he claimed that he
              asked me nicely to tap my EZ link card for verification.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">And he next taunted me by saying that I can lodged a
              complaint against him if I feel like it and further said that I was being
              aggressive and he would report me to the police even though he raised his voice
              at me first. Of course I was angry and raised my voice back at him. He kept
              raising his voice, taunting me and still embarrassing and humiliating me by
              saying that I was aggressive even though he was the one who raised his voice
              throughout the conversation until I got off the bus.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">May I enquire if your bus captains were trained to
              embarrassed, humiliated, taunt and be aggressive towards passengers who paid
              their fares duly and without a word of apology?</p>

              <p>Not all bus drivers are like that.</p>

              <p>I was complained once for being rude to passengers. But really I was innocent, I was driving a mid-engine bus, and the engine was loud, so got to raise voice to speak to passengers.</p>

              <p><br>Seriously, I don't agree with what you suggested. Be it small or big, even though we mostly stand on the BC side, such mistakes are not to be let off so easily. If we let the BC off that easily, he will repeat his mistakes the next time.

              <p>Ok. I catch your drift. I got another story. I took service 985 from Boon Keng MRT to my house. It was a UK Dennis Lance. I had returned from a camp and I was carrying a lot of things. I went up the bus, due to the narrow space, I had to bump a bit to get in. Then, the driver just accused me of spoiling the card reader which I obviously didn't. Then, I explained that I was carrying a lot of things but he didn't listened to me and continued to accuse me. For the whole journey to my house, he was complaining. Obviously, I do not want to hear him complain. Luckily, my destination bus stop was quite near and got off the bus. I would not say the rego of that bus to prevent rising comments.......</p>

              <p>Ok. I catch your drift. I got another story. I took service 985 from Boon Keng MRT to my house. It was a UK Dennis Lance. I had returned from a camp and I was carrying a lot of things. I went up the bus, due to the narrow space, I had to bump a bit to get in. Then, the driver just accused me of spoiling the card reader which I obviously didn't. Then, I explained that I was carrying a lot of things but he didn't listened to me and continued to accuse me. For the whole journey to my house, he was complaining. Obviously, I do not want to hear him complain. Luckily, my destination bus stop was quite near and got off the bus. I would not say the rego of that bus to prevent rising comments.......</p>

              <p><br>haha, SMRT drivers again. SMRT drivers always shout here and there, accuse here and there. No wonder majority of the bus fans prefer SBST than SMRT drivers. SBST drivers are more friendly than SMRT drivers. I experienced one Sv 172 BC driving a DAF who will shout at passengers just because the bell was pressed twice but in fact the bus stopping light was spoilt. Seriosuly, even I prefer SBST drivers than SMRT drivers even though I lived in the SMRT territory in CCK.</p>

              <p>Like the saying goes, you always see the bright smile of SBST drivers. But you will always see the dark smile of SMRT drivers.</p>

              <p>Interesting! There was once when I was a dumb and broke teen. I boarded the bus and paid 70 cents, then the driver asked where am I going. I replied, "In front." He asked me in front where? I repeated the same thing and took my seat. Then when the 70 cents has been burst, he shouted thru the mirror, "You want to stop where??" Then I shouted back, "I got no money!" Then he lan lan, kept quiet and drove me all the way till interchange.</p>
