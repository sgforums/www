If they are going to Orchard, Bugis, lavender and Kallang, there is always a faster mean of transport which is the Mass Rapid Transit.<br><br>Service 7 was amended to terminate from JE to CLE after the JE MRT commenced.</div>

The route for Service 38 is almost directly parallel to the EW line from Tampines to Bedok, and inclusive of Expo station, yet nobody is complaining. I know this: I'm a regular rider. The service calls at all 4 MRT stations: Tampines (int.), Simei (along St. 3), Tanah Merah (New Upper Changi Road) , Bedok (int.), and Expo (the 2 bus stops outside Singapore Expo).<br></div></blockquote>Firstly, you should know that 38 was a merger of services 290 and 220. These 2 services were meant to serve people living in Simei and Bedok South. Service 38 being a merger as the added bonus of connecting Simei and Bedok South to Expo. 38's first priority is a psuedo-feeder service, not a trunk service linking Tampines and Bedok.<br></div>
