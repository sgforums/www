            <div class='col-md body'>COMMUTERS will have to bear part of the costs of the increased security on the trains.<br><br>Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong did not say how much the price of a ride would rise, but indicated that the bill for the extra measures will not be 'unreasonable'.<br><br>The measures should cost no more than 10 per cent of what the public transport operators incur overall in running their business, he said in a TV news broadcast yesterday.<br><br>'If you look at a factory, there's a guard at the main gate, it goes into part of the cost of the product,' he said.<br><br>'The challenge is to make sure the security systems are reasonable and don't impose an unreasonable cost on the operator.'<br><br>One of the measures is to have marshals ride the rails here.<br><br>The United States screens the luggage and carry-on bags of subway commuters during high-risk periods, among other precautions.<br><br>Singapore will not carry out '100 per cent' checks on all commuters, because these would be expensive and unrealistic.<br><br>The authorities are still discussing how the security costs will be shared, the minister said.<br><br>Currently, the cost of putting marshals on Singapore Airlines flights is borne by the Government and the airline.<br><br>However, passengers departing Singapore have to pay a $6 fee because of the new security systems at the airport, more stringent baggage checks and other measures.<br><br>SMRT and ComfortDelgro, which operate the trains and buses here, said yesterday they are working very closely with the authorities to determine the security measures to be implemented. Cost is one key issue.<br><br>SMRT said: 'We'll do whatever is most effective within a reasonable cost.'<br><br>ComfortDelgro said: 'We are satisfied the cost of these added measures is likely to be manageable.'<br><br>An MP for Hong Kah GRC, Mr Ang Mong Seng, who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, said the entire cost of the added security should not be automatically passed on to commuters.<br><br>Any change in fares, he added, should be based on the whole operating cost of running the business.<br><br>'If the management can cut down expenditure in other areas, commuters may not need to pay the full cost of the security measures.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>i hope its a fair share - fair meaning the operators should bear a larger portion of the cost, especially if they are currently making significant profits.<br><br></div>

Urgh.</div></blockquote>yesterday i had the chance to take the MRT without using my stored value ezlink card. and the cost of travelling became alot more stark from buying the single trip tickets.<br><br>but again, i must say given the conditions of our transport system, the cost of transport is reasonable (vis cost of living), as compared to other major cities such as london.<br><br>however, the lower income group would definitely be at the losing end.<br><br>hence if they are going to raise the transport costs again, i urge them to provide more comprehensive and extensive transport subsidies to the lower income group.</div>
