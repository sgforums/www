              <h2 class="ReadMsgSubject"><span style="color: #888888;">Is it really right to charge those under 21 
                                  year old with adult fares? maybe it is time to introduce a new rate?‏</span><br><br>I believe there are many of us who are under 21 year 
                                  old, yet are being charged with ADULT fare. <br>NSF, University 
                                  students, Polytechnic students, drop out and working, etc whom are under
                                   21 year old, are being charged with ADULT fare.<br><br>The argument 
                                  that many gave on why should we be charged with adult fares are that 
                                  once you do not wear "uniform", you are considered as an adult.<br>the 
                                  explanation was that when one is free from uniforms and rules, one 
                                  should be more mature and responsible, thus we have to pay ADULT fare.<br><br>However,
                                   I thought that maturity are not defined by what you wear, whether you 
                                  are schooling or not, and what kind of education you are receiving.<br> I feel that one should be considered as an adult only when one are fully
                                   
                                  responsible of what one did.<br><br>For example, Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to be in casino when they
                                   
                                  turned the age of 21.<br>Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to vote only when
                                   they are 21 too.<br>Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to watch RA when they
                                   are 21. again.<br>I have heard rumours saying that EVEN the requirement
                                   of learning driving license is about to change to the age of 21 too.<br><br> I believe the government set the age only at 21, but not 18, 19 or 20, 
                                  is because government know that only at 
                                  the age of 21, then could one be considered as an adult, a YOUNG 
                                  adult.<br>Only at the age of 21, one could be matured enough to think 
                                  wisely, make the right decision and be responsible for all the things 
                                  that one did.<br><br>I understand that Singapore laws considered one as 
                                  an adult when one turn 18.<br>However, its obvious that only at the age 
                                  of 21, then one should be truly considered as an adult. *refer to the 
                                  example above*<br><br>Thus, I truly hope that government could introduce
                                   a new rate, called teenager fare.<br>This is because, between the age 
                                  of 18 to 21, we are too YOUNG to be considered as an adult, thus should 
                                  not be charged as one.<br>and we are also too old to be considered as 
                                  children.<br><br>Thus, those who are not eligible for students fare, as 
                                  they are not under MOE, should receive the "teenager fare"<br>Those who 
                                  are between 18 to 21, but are still considered students under MOE, 
                                  should still be receiving students fare. *remain unchanged*<br><br>I am 
                                  also aware that there are currently concession for those who are in 
                                  tertiary education, however it does not benefit those who needs to take 
                                  both bus and MRT, especially with the distance based traveling now.<br><br>Therefore,
                                   I truly hope that the government could consider my humble idea on 
                                  introducing a new rate based on "age" policy, instead of the education 
                                  one is receiving, its like the "height" policy SMRT introduced for 
                                  children.<br>Thus, those who are between 18 to 21 who are in NSF, 
                                  University, Polytechnics, not schooling should be charged with the new 
                                  rate, while those who are in University, Polytechnics whom are above 21 
                                  have to pay adult fare.<br><br>I believe with the teenager rate 
                                  introduced, it could strongly reduced the burden of middle and low 
                                  income family. <br>It could also further encourage and help the young to
                                   blend into the society better, as they faces obstacles in the working 
                                  life, that they had never faced.<br><br>Finally, I hope that the 
                                  relevant authorities would take my suggestion into consideration.
                                  <br></h2>

              <p>I remember hearing somewhere before (Finance Minster Tharman S. if I recall correctly) that should bus fares be COMPLETELY subsidized (meaning ZERO FARES FOR ALL), the government would have to raise GST to 11 ~ 13% barring recent economic fluctuations. But this would effectively mean that SBST and SMRT's bus and train divisions would be completely "nationalised" and bought over by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually for my adult life, I wouldn't mind having to pay GST 11 ~ 13%, better than having to bring an Ez-Link card to pay for fares, regardless of how short the distance would be (let's say one stop, you still get charged the 69¢ or something)...</p>

              <p>With an aging population = more people getting purple card = adults paying more tp subsidise this group of people and the school-going kids.</p>
              <p>If the tertiary and NSFs pay kids fare, that will carry more burden on the adults.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #888888;">Is it really right to
              charge those under 21 year old with adult fares? maybe it is time
              to introduce a new rate?‏</span><br> <br> I believe there are many of us who are under 21 year old, yet are
              being charged with ADULT fare.<br> NSF, University students, Polytechnic students, drop out and
              working, etc whom are under 21 year old, are being charged with
              ADULT fare.<br> <br> The argument that many gave on why should we be charged with adult
              fares are that once you do not wear "uniform", you are considered
              as an adult.<br> the explanation was that when one is free from uniforms and rules,
              one should be more mature and responsible, thus we have to pay
              ADULT fare.<br> <br> However, I thought that maturity are not defined by what you wear,
              whether you are schooling or not, and what kind of education you
              are receiving.<br> I feel that one should be considered as an adult only when one are
              fully responsible of what one did.<br> <br> For example, Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to be in casino when
              they turned the age of 21.<br> Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to vote only when they are 21
              too.<br> Singaporeans are ONLY allowed to watch RA when they are 21.
              again.<br> I have heard rumours saying that EVEN the requirement of learning
              driving license is about to change to the age of 21 too.<br> <br> I believe the government set the age only at 21, but not 18, 19 or
              20, is because government know that only at the age of 21, then
              could one be considered as an adult, a YOUNG adult.<br> Only at the age of 21, one could be matured enough to think wisely,
              make the right decision and be responsible for all the things that
              one did.<br> <br> I understand that Singapore laws considered one as an adult when
              one turn 18.<br> However, its obvious that only at the age of 21, then one should be
              truly considered as an adult. *refer to the example above*<br> <br> Thus, I truly hope that government could introduce a new rate,
              called teenager fare.<br> This is because, between the age of 18 to 21, we are too YOUNG to
              be considered as an adult, thus should not be charged as one.<br> and we are also too old to be considered as children.<br> <br> Thus, those who are not eligible for students fare, as they are not
              under MOE, should receive the "teenager fare"<br> Those who are between 18 to 21, but are still considered students
              under MOE, should still be receiving students fare. *remain
              unchanged*<br> <br> I am also aware that there are currently concession for those who
              are in tertiary education, however it does not benefit those who
              needs to take both bus and MRT, especially with the distance based
              traveling now.<br> <br> Therefore, I truly hope that the government could consider my
              humble idea on introducing a new rate based on "age" policy,
              instead of the education one is receiving, its like the "height"
              policy SMRT introduced for children.<br> Thus, those who are between 18 to 21 who are in NSF, University,
              Polytechnics, not schooling should be charged with the new rate,
              while those who are in University, Polytechnics whom are above 21
              have to pay adult fare.<br> <br> I believe with the teenager rate introduced, it could strongly
              reduced the burden of middle and low income family.<br> It could also further encourage and help the young to blend into
              the society better, as they faces obstacles in the working life,
              that they had never faced.<br> <br> Finally, I hope that the relevant authorities would take my
              suggestion into consideration.<br></h2>

              <p>I believe many of you are 21yo and below. University and Polytechnic student are tertiary students, NSF are getting paid and those working sure got pay.</p>
              <p>Maturity is not defined by age but actions.</p>
              <p>The reason why University and Polytechnic students are not given "student" rates is simple, adults aged 25 and above can still attend these institutions. Thus, it will be difficult for tertiary institutions of education to monitor whom is eligible for passes or not. All who are attending are considered "adults".</p>
