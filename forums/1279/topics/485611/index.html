              <p>Actually this is just my side suggestion...I mentioned that if he had not talked about Striders, I would have reminded him that it is better that all the MK4s are included in this thread, since DM3500s and DMs are de-registering around the same period.</p>
              <p>But that is not what I asked him in the first place. My main point is, why do people bother to open lay up and redeployment threads for buses coming near to de-registration dates, especially to replace those expired ones?</p>
              <p>Those on the Leyland Olympians, MK4s, SMRT O405s, DAFs and others are completely useless once there is a long break between expiry dates.</p>
              <p>For example, in 2012, I opened a Part 2 thread for SMRT O405s because TIB436J's and TIB442R's original de-registration date are more than three months apart (TIB442R's batch is following TIB436J's batch), which result in the part 1 thread expiring due to more than three months of inactiveness.</p>
              <p>Without viable information, there is nothing to talk about. The only exception is the Volvo Olympian thread, but that is because I am able to keep it active with some posts to ask on updates. However I am unable to keep every single thread active for some reasons. If you have noticed, I had stopped creating threads for DAFs and O405s, as per the reason stated in the above paragraph.</p>

              <p>Nope, SBS9383L is already de-registered in May 2014 without the second lifespan extension...SBS9370Z, SBS9378C, SBS9383L and SBS9389X are still parked at AMDEP lay up corner, with other new buses blocking them...I presume this is the reason they have yet to be towed out as of 8th August.</p>
