            <div class='col-md body'>For me, when it comes to suspension ride comfort, i'll classify broadly into just leaf-spring or air-suspension.<br><br>For superior ride comfort, it'll take air-suspension.<br><br>Ranked from best to worse in suspension ride comfort among the common models here, I'll put it as (best) M-B O 405, O 405 G, Volvo B9TL, Volvo/Leyland Olympians, Scania K230UB, Scania N113CRB, Volvo B10M Mk.4, Mk.2 then Mk.3 (worse !)<br><br>I notice the suspension on O 405 &amp; even O 305 while overall is very comfortable can get somewhat bouncy when over excessive undulations. Same too i recall among the other older M-B models like on OH 1627 L.<br><br>However, the newer generation M-B O 500 like 1725 etc. tends to be remarkably very stable (with hardly any bounciness left-right or  frontwards-rearwards !) whether doing 50 or 100 km/h &amp; just as comfortable as the older M-B air-suspended models. I think on this model you can hold your cup of coffee with the least chances of spillage even @ 120 km/h !<br>Dislike though is that the suspension is the noisier type, something like on the Scanias BUT without the inferior comfort levels from those.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by alleggerita:</div><div class="quote_body">I always thought electronically-controlled air suspension gives the best ride quality..like in Mercedes S-Class with air suspension..it's like magic carpet ride..<br><br>But those buses with electronically controlled air suspension in SG like the Volvo B9TL/B10TL, and the Scania K230UBs, their ride quality seems so-so only..<br><br>Of course, when compared to other buses like the B10Ms (Mk2, 3 and 4), the Scania N113CRB and the DDs like LO3x and VO3x..the B9TL/B10TLs and K230UBs have a smoother ride..<br><br>But when compared to the Merc O.405, i think the 0.405's ride is even better!

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i forgotten about the Dennis Tridents here &amp; their 'left-right' movements ! Find it somewhat unique in the air-suspended category such undesirable behavior.

            <div class='col-md body'>I encountered the same observations regarding the Scanias.<br><br>While i notice all the Scanias i sat on have noisy suspensions, the lower floor city-bus models tend to have a 'rough' ride with minimal damping ?!<br>Seems no improvements whether on the 1989 or 2007 models. Perhaps it's not an area of priority for them to work on ??<br><br>However on the high-floor Scanias the suspension ride comfort is far better but still not quite as overall comfortable as on the MAN &amp; M-B, in that order.<br><br>M-B has been very consistently superior in this area, whether in the spring or air-suspended categories. Volvo has made huge improvements in this area, from the B10M era to B9TL although i believe the mid-engine placement on the B10M is a major reason for the over light hence lively rear end, thus resulting in poor suspension comfort especially over there.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scania N113CRB luver:</div><div class="quote_body">Agreed .

I still think the rattling noise comes from the whole suspension frame. It's common on B10M Mk3s and some Mk4 too. Even a few DM3500 is suffering from it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason the B9TL doesn't dip under braking is because of the Electronic Brake Distribution which means that the force of braking is equal across the front and rear axles, which still factoring forces of inertia.
