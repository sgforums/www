              <p><br> Then go ahead. I'll be glad that SBST or someone better to take
                  over these services.</p>
              <p><br> 852 already has bad frequencies, and removing one bus is going to
                  make matters worse for the service. More people are going to
                  complain. Even to take out one bus from 852, it is
                  still logical to add it into 855 instead. 855 has very erratic
                  frequencies in the peak hours and sometimes the current fleet can't
                  even cope with the load during peak. Moreover many services can't
                  really cope with the current fleet already, so crossover is not a
                  feasible way out.</p>
              <p>Like what I've said, if they don't take on RWS and use the extra
                  fleet to improve standards of the current services, there won't be
                  so much woes now.</p>

              <p><br>dun forget there is demand for SP students, and also the JW Ave 3 bus stops towards slbp bound which have a lot of Westwood Sec students boarding the bus, even 1 ADD also cant handle the load when many Westwood students trying to squeeze in the bus during PM peak.</p>
              <p>i think the buona vista bound has high demand than slbp bound during pm peak.</p>

              <p>I think it's best to take out one bus from a service that doesn't have too much demand like Sv 852 or add in one more S2 slot to 184 that would make downroutes from SIM. Also, we have to take note whether it would be economical which i doubt it would be. The most economical way is to have a crossover from another service.</p>

              <p><br>Talking about that, another point is regarding Jalan Anak Bukit Bus Stop (towards NP)<br>I try to avoid that bus stop during peak hours (if I take Sv 985, would rather alight at Shell Station Bus Stop and walk by the back gate)<br>Sometimes there are high loads of students who take services like (67, 961 etc...) and alight at there to transfer to Sv 52,61,75,184.<br>Even though there are four services to choose from, it can be a headache to board them(partly students don't want to move to the rear), jam along Upp Bt Timah Rd, PIE and etc....<br><br>Other issues....<br>I think they can put a big banner or poster at NP Bus Stop to remind them to move to the rear</p>
              <p>Sv 151A can be extended to Jalan Toa Payoh (Trellis Towers Bus Stop) if feasible, as many students will alight at there.</p>
