              <p>The reason from of the added crowds is due to changes in
              timetable, thanks to a ICA ruling. SIM-UB also changed their
              morning lessons to start at 8.30 (used to be 9). Hence, the whole
              darned SIM starts at the same time.<br> <br> In this case, might as well g et 52/154/74 to increase frequencies
              too.But surely, that aint possibly going to happen. I hope private
              mini bus can come into the picture though.</p>

              <p>What's with the ICA ruling? <br><br>RMIT courses used to start at 845am or 930am and 2pm... now its like same timing for the whole school. <br><br>I believe its due to increased intake of students. Probably because of the closure of certain private schools and also to temporary house increased intake before the new annex at SIM officially opens.</p>

              <p><br>852 already has bad frequencies, and removing one bus is going to make matters worse for the service. More people are going to complain. Even to take out one bus from 852, it is still logical to add it into 855 instead. 855 has very erratic frequencies in the peak hours and sometimes the current fleet can't even cope with the load during peak. Moreover many services can't really cope with the current fleet already, so crossover is not a feasible way out.</p>
              <p>Like what I've said, if they don't take on RWS and use the extra fleet to improve standards of the current services, there won't be so much woes now.</p>

              <p>What's with the ICA ruling?<br><br>RMIT courses used to start at 845am or 930am and 2pm... now its like same timing for the whole school.<br><br>I believe its due to increased intake of students.

              <p><br>thanks to SIM's room allocation system, RMIT and UB students follow the UOL class timings as what u said in your very first post. Good for SIM, bad for the PTOs.</p>
              <p>For 1830 dismissals, it takes about 40min to clear most pax from the SIM bus stop 12091. From that bus stop. 61 takes the least % of the pax, followed by 52. The champion goes to 74 and 184. For some reason 75 pales against 184 probably cos of the timing.151 and 154 are evenly split as most students take whichever that comes first.</p>
              <p>SIM's 0830 class creates problems for NUS' 0900 tutorials. NP isnt largely affected.<br>Dismissal at 1130 will face a 1 stop block northbound between SIM and NP as some NP classes start at 1200.</p>
              <p>SIM's 1200 class also creates problems for NUS classes that start at 1200. However this can be spread out and not as problematic as the 0830 ones. The clash with be with NP classes that start at 1200.<br>Dismissal at 1500 would clash with the NP crowd. Fortunately around 1515 got 1 74 downroute from NP to help out.</p>
              <p>SIM's 1530 class will clash with NUS 1600 classes but this is a small issue. Dismissal at 1830 doesnt affect NP side but will clash with people coming from Clementi MRT for their 1900 class. NUS side will clash with SIM also esp if NUS lecturers finish on time.</p>
              <p>SIM's 1900 class clashes with PM Peak crowd, dont even need student loads. Dismissal at 2200 is no problem (like duh) as its the carpark that gets jammed and much lesser people take the bus home. 2220 bus stop cleared but carpark not yet.</p>

              <p><br>if you do not know or so hate against what I'm saying tat you dun even go find info, 154's freq is 2 - 10 mins from BNL towards NP these days. The 2 mins is possible w/ 154A.</p>
              <p>The only problem now is towards BNL's erratic schedule after post 0830 - 0930 schedule, because of jam at Woodsville, Clementi Rd, Clementi Ave 6</p>
