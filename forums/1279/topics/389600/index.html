              </div>
              <div id="MsgContainer" class="ExternalClass"><br>Hi SMRT,<br><br>I am a SIM Student and recently, there
                  has been significant changes in our school timetabling system, that has
                  resulted in a lot of students squeezing into some of your buses
                  (especially 184) during certain times and wish to take you into
                  attention on the issue. <br><br>Our school timetable has been changed
                  into 4 fixed sessions instead of the usual staggered timetabling system
                  due to an increased intake of about an estimated of 2,000 students. <br><br>The timings are:<br>830 - 1130 hrs<br>1200 - 1500 hrs<br>1530 - 1830 hrs<br>1900 - 2200 hrs<br><br>I
                  have observed in the past 3 weeks of the school semester that the buses
                  were too crowded and there are many students who were stranded at the
                  bus stop. <br><br>This is especially so during the 1445 - 1530 hrs,
                  1815 hrs - 1845 hrs on both directions of the SIM bus stop (for 184)
                  when students go home after school. <br>There is an estimated of about
                  200 students on each side of the bus stop during these timings and
                  about 40% of them (80 students) are boarding 184. <br>About 10 students on average have to be left out at the bus stop on almost every 184 bus that stops at SIM bus stop. <br><br>I
                  understand that efforts had been made in the past to cater to students,
                  but the current schedule seems to be postdated back to the olden days'
                  demand. <br><br>I wish SMRT can reschedule the bus timings and
                  consider deploying more buses to reach the SIM bus stop during the 1445
                  - 1530 hrs, 1815 hrs - 1845 hrs so that it would not inconvenience
                  students from SIM and Ngee Ann Polytechnic. <br><br>I hope SMRT would look at my suggestions. Thank you for your attention. <br><br>With Regards,<br>junyang700<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br>

                  understand that the timings that you have mentioned are school
                  dismissal times, which will see an influx of passengers taking bus
                  service 184. As buses have limited capacity, we might not always be
                  able to pick up all students in one trip. We also wish to highlight
                  that the scheduled frequency for service 184 during the time concerned
                  is between 6 and 15 minutes.</span></p>

              SMRT should consider deploying empty buses to this bus-stop for mid-trip svcs, not just brushing it off as sudden influx of passengers, since this is daily occurance.
              And passengers down the route are all being held up, esp for those who got no other route alternatives.

              <p>I hate the crowded buses. Anyway, I usually miss one bus too. I can take 75 and 184 and I will usually miss the first bus that comes. You need to run towards the bus when it approaches. But sometimes you cant walk to the bus too... The crowd for the buses is just horrible. <br><br>Thankfully, its only once a week for me as my school ends on Tuesday at 630pm. Rest of the time I leave school by my friend's car.</p>

              <p>Its worst now. <br><br>I havent seen something as bad as now. <br><br>And to your surpise, its the SIM timing that crowd the buses. <br>8am, 9am classes ... 4pm, 5pm classes for Ngee Ann crowd still manageable because services like 74 and 184 have special downroute or added frequencies due to reach these bus stops during this period. <br><br>Same dismissal time is now introduced with 1/3 of the SIM school population leaving the bus stop everyday at the same time and situation is worst at the 1830 hrs as students leave school at the same time, unlike other timings where some students stay back to do projects or eat lunch in school. <br><br>There is an estimate of 200 students at one bus stop per direction during this timing. <br>The Ngee Ann crowd still isnt that bad these days because the bus stop is quite big and broad, unlike the SIM bus stop that is about twice the length of normal bus stops.</p>

              <p>True. I always see commuters who cant board 966 (7am onwards to 10am) from Pending LRT onwards towards Marine Parade. Its pretty bad especially when the frequency is between 15 - 20 minutes and you cant board the bus because its packed to the doors. <br><br>700 also encounters this problem from 7am to 10am. The bendy crossover from 963 just isnt enough.</p>
