              <p><br>ya jam.. cos ppl who work/study in the west stay in the east.</p>
              <p>toa payoh is at the centre of the jams. but think of it.. you live in toa payoh you endure 1 part of the jam. if you travel beyond toa payoh there's part 2. Here are some examples that involves going thru toa payoh</p>
              <p>Work: Clementi/Pandan<br>live: anywhere east of paya lebar rd</p>
              <p>to get to work hit PIE using Jln Eunos, Bedok North Rd or Paya Lebar Rd. you get 1 jam near Woodsville. the next jam is slightly before BKE exit thanks to the speed camera, next at the Anak Bt exit and then Clementi Rd.</p>
              <p>to go home its Clementi Rd, Dunearn Rd/PIE and then whitley is slightly better and then jam again after the Toa payoh exit. and it will only ease up when you exit at eunos. travelling beyond that would have smoother traffic.</p>
              <p>If bartley rd east is anywhere to come by, morning gives you the airport rd/kaki bt exit heavy traffic + braddell viaduct jam + lornie heavy traffic + adam rd entrance jam. evening gives you lornie exit jam + braddell Rd CTE exit jam.</p>
              <p>Another case is</p>
              <p>Work: buona vista/nuh/alexandra rd<br>live: serangoon/hougang/sengkang</p>
              <p>morning if in sengkang you get the KPE heavy traffic, or CTE if you can afford. Serangoon will get heavy traffic at upp serangoon rd turning to braddell. Those on KPE will exit PIE (if wanna avoid ERP at ECP) and u get a jam there, then slightly smooth traffic till adam rd exit. Those on braddell will get jam on the braddell viaduct and lornie heavy traffic. Then you get farrer rd flyover jam till the holland rd underpass. then smooth till queensway/portsdown ave junction. Those at alexandra have to endure 4 cycles of the alexandra rd/queensway junction then after that its heavy traffic to alexandra rd offices. Those at bnv/nuh have to endure the AYE sth bnv exit jam.</p>
              <p>evening those from bnv/nuh have to endure the nth bnv entrance to aye before exiting at portsdown to the ORR. alternatively they can use c'wealth ave which is slightly better. those from alexandra have smooth traffic until the queensway underpass. then its jam until the empress place/farrer rd junction then its smooth flowing until lornie road. those taking the PIE will get the jam from adam (heavy traffic) till toa payoh exits. If heading back to hougang and using upp serangoon viaduct will have to endure the woodsville exit jam. those going to kpe will endure the jam from toa payoh exit till pie entrance itself. hitting KPE thereafter is slightly better. Those who proceed onto lornie will get heavy traffic then slight jam at braddell rd cos of the cte braddell exit. then its smooth as well as upp serangoon rd.</p>
              <p>in short: live in east, work in east. conversely, live in west, work in west. jams are lesser that way.</p>
              <p>you no need to reply, but just to give you an idea of the daily peak hour jams.</p>

              <p>relax, pardon me for being blunt. but we all know the

              constructive and of value.</p>
              <p>everytime i say smth factual and making sense, he just has to
              cluck back smth irrelevant, totally off tangent, ridiculous and
              nonsensical toward me. what an immature twit. i believe
              we have seen it occur more than 10 times already. and it sure
              cracks everyone up. (: <br> for everyone knows the rotten name he has given himself to this
              point of time. </p>
              <p>we should ignore him, for talking to him is kinda
              pointless. its like talking to a chicken who clucks
              loudly to himself, just to hear himself and overpower others
              feeling he is right and always will be right and the rest are
              wrong. this somehow gives him the self pleasure, amusement and
              satisfaction which i dare say that he basically is a
              mentally unsound, socially impaired, ethically retarded

              <p>But then again, a Kleines Huhn is probably another hum in a shell, whose amazingly high disproportional intellect to ego ratio is most certainly startling to start off with...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh wells, the little Huhn's posts to anything other than the hum's scope of peripheral vision and ideology is most expected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why is the hum-ed huhn attempting to be confident when all it does best is to "Talk Cock and Sing Idiotic Songs in praise of its own deluded hum-ised peripheral view of the world?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is another daily routine display of idiocy and irrelevance of the Hum-ed Huhn to exercise its 'Labia Majora' and 'Labia Minora' - simply to attract attention to itself as the resident Attention Seeking Whore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all you people know, the next thing the hum-ed huhn in its limited scope of peripheral vision and poker-faced ideology would declare to the world that "Don't you wish your girlfriend(/guyfriend) was hum/huhn like me?"... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hum-ed huhn's posts are wildly cocked, and whose poker-faced ideology at revering a single unit of a corporation(a depot) is disturbing to all enthusiasts of differing modes of transportation alike. Let there not be a second hum-ised huhn.</p>
