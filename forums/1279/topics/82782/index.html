            <div class='col-md body'>my guess is that 911's checkpoint direction will be cut out to 950 and 911 will retain only its dr 83 sector under the same number 911. thus:<br><br>Wodlands Regional Interchange, (Woodlands Ave 3), St 11, Centre Rd, Woodlands Checkpoint, JB Checkpoint, (... Jln Air Molek ...), Kota Raya 2 Terminal. (jus like CW1 and 170X)<br><br>anyway, on my recee trip to JB, i've found no traces of 950. some points:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> there are no new railings made for any new services at Woodlands Checkpoint. fyi, CW1 operates out of a makeshift railing and i suppose 950 will have to bear with that too. and the signages only have SJE (Singapore-Johor Express) and SBS but no CW and SMRTB.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the congestion at the coaches lane is already unbearable during peak hours. it will surely get worse if 950 comes in. i wonder if there is over-demand.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> the Queen St - Larkin route has been approved by MY authorities. boarding a CW1 bus, u will most likely find a copy of the approved route sheet, just like 170 buses. some changes coming up:<br>CW1 ([Fare] Stage Bus): goes from Larkin to Kranji MRT as per now, then down Upp Bt Timah Rd &amp; Bt Timah/Dunearn Rd as per 170, jus that it stops on alternate stops only. yes, the route shows things like "King Albert's Park, Blissvale, Sixth Ave, National JC, Coronation Plaza etc".<br>CW2 (Express Bus): details not not, but presumably an express version of 170. now, tis could be a real competitor to SBST's 170.<br>these changes will take effect sometime in August.</div>

His depot operates Service 170, thus BBDEP but he's based in ARBP. Service 170 never had Singaporean bus captains, and that would apply for Service 950 service captains too.</div></blockquote>Really? That's a very interesting revelation. Thanks for the headup!</div>

Also, people avoid as we would rather support our services. Just like there are few takers to Senai Airport as in the news paper report "Only 20% of 600,000 passengers in Jan - May are Singaporeans"</div>
