              <p>Hello guys!</p>
              <p>I am it_geek... This is my first post and first topic, so please do bear with me if I have not observed proper forum etiquette!</p>
              <p>Jumping straight to the point... I do have some questions about buses.</p>
              <p>Let's start with this one...</p>
              <p><img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/fxdzpu.jpg" alt="SBS 1954S on tow by an Yishun Towing Tow Truck. - Image taken by it_geek on 19th January 2013. I own all copyrights to the photo and I reserve all rights for this photo."></p>
              <p>I happened to be running some errands and was walking down Bukit Batok West Ave 3 and I was lucky to catch this. I was in a rush to take the photo and the only device I had was my phone camera so please don't blame me for the poor quality.</p>
              <p><br>The bus featured in this photo is SBS 1954S.</p>
              <p>Initially, I thought that the bus had broken down and was being towed for repairs (as with the other already dying Volvo B10M MK-IV WAS-bodied buses)</p>
              <p>...until I saw the Road Tax sticker on the windscreen which said 22 Nov 2012.<br>I later confirmed this with the sgwiki.com website, and it said it was going to be de-registered.</p>
              <p>How many scrapyard sites does SBS have? So far I only know of one at 35, Sungei Kaut Street 6 and the one in Defu, Hougang.</p>
              <p><br>So... is this bus going to be taking straight to the scrapyard and disassembled? Do you think this bus is going to Sungei Kadut?</p>
              <p>Or is it going to another temporary holding area?</p>
              <p>What does the 'OK' on the windscreen mean? This ok symbol was also seen on the back of this same bus.</p>
              <p>(I also recalled in 2011 that I may had seen SBS 972X being towed by another Yishun Towing Towing truck. I was quite sure it was SBS 972X because although the entire shell didn't fry up, the entire radiator/engine area of the Volvo B10M MK-IV was burnt out in the center. I also spotted a couple of intentionally broken windows, and a seat lifted up as part of the emergency escape procedure. The tempered glass left exit door also was partly cracked. Most importantly, this bus also had the 'OK' inscribed onto the back and front of the bus. I last saw it travelling in the direction of Bukit Batok Road...)</p>
              <p>Just some more shots of SBS 1954S being towed away:</p>

              <p>In before lock: there is alr a stickied thread for qns abt buses. But since u newbie, I shall understand and help u here. </p>
              <p>Buses will be laid-up prior to de-registration. However, lay-up is done sometime before the de-reg time. Lay-up is the displacement of a bus out of service and resting it in the depot, before it is de-regged and eventually scrapped. </p>
              <p>Hope this helps :)</p>
