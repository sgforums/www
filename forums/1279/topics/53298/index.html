            <div class='col-md body'>Howdy there!<br><br>For a start, I don't know why you all hate Dennis Lances so much.  They are a very suitable bus, with a beautiful turbo whistle, and minimal turbo lag, as opposed to buses like the Volvo B7R/B7L/B7RLE, the B10TL/Super Olympian, and the Scania L94UB (with a full seated load, and from a standing start).  he primary reason for these units to overheat, as told by a mechanic I know from TIBS is the fact that these buses are GOVERNED to the ridiculously slow speed of 60km/h.  As one would know, restricting the potential of a powerful engine to a low speed, and a low gear means the engine and gearbox is under extreme stress.  As a result, all Dennis Lances have gone through one engine reconditioning, and at least one gearbox change.  A severe case is in the case of TIB912B, a Lance 245, which has had a new engine put in about 7 months ago, and has gone through two gearboxes.  So, for those Lance haters out there, do not blame TIBS for poor maintenance, or Dennis for manufacturing a poor quality bus, but blame the Singapore Government and the LTC for implementing a very dangerous and stupid rule.<br><br>Now, in reply to your question, I do have a photo of an interior of a Volgren bodied O.405....one of a unit from Sydney, Australia, and another from TIB959S.  959 can be found on the route 969 from Tampines to Woodlands, so go hunting around.  Also, try 171, or 960.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AntiDennisLance,<br><br>Suspension wise the Lances are about as taut as an M.A.N, but at least all the bumps in the road aren't felt in the cabin like a B10M.  Although none of the B10Ms are going fast enough for you to know what I mean (either because they are too gutless, or because they just don't reach such a speed to do so), I'm sure you will understand where I am coming from.  I will try to get the pic of 959's interior scanned, but it may take a while.<br><br>Re the lack of seats, blame TIBS, especially for removing seats for standing room in a number of buses....at least the UD's haven't been touched.  Also, I think you will find that the Malaysian bodied Lances seem restricted in their seatig only because of the longitudinal seats at the front.
