              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">Dear All from the
              "Singapore Buses" Forum,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">I'll like to introduce
              myself as Wenxiang, a producer from Threesixzero Productions, a local TV
              production company.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;"><span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times;">We are currently producing
              an eight-part documentary series “Say Goodbye" </span><span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">ã€Š</span><span style="font-family: FZZhunYuan-M02S;">è¯´</span><span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">å†�</span><span style="font-family: FZZhunYuan-M02S;">è§�</span><span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">ã€‹</span><span style="font-family: Times;">for
              Channel 8 slated to air end of the year</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;"><span>For one of the episodes, we
              are featuring a 65-year-old SBS bus captain who is retiring after 45 years in
              service. For purpose of filming, we wonder if we can possibly enlist your kind
              assistance with a few enquiries:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">1. Will anyone know of any
              old refurbished buses which interiors are still intact? We had a look at three:
              the one at the youth park opposite Heeren, another attached to Pat's
              Schoolhouse at Jubilee Park and the last one which have been converted into a
              mobile library. However for all three, the seats have been removed. Does anyone
              know of a disused bus which interiors are somewhat preserved in their original
              conditions?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">2. To re-enact some of the
              scenes when our bus captain was still a bus conductor with the then Singapore
              Traction Company, we wonder if anyone may have in their
              possessions certain memorabilia associated with the era and are kind enough to
              make us a loan of them for filming? Almost anything will prove to be useful to
              us but we are on a special lookout for items such as bus tickets, the ticket
              puncher and money bag that are part of the bus conductor's get-up, and the khaki uniforms
              etc etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times;">3. Lastly, will any one have
              any old photos or even any film/videos that can help us relive the evolution of
              Singapore's public bus transport system over the last 60-70 years, i.e. from
              trams and trolley buses to the STC monopoly to the establishment of SBS. Will
              anyone know of any books or text dealing with the history of our public buses?
              We have gone through most of the essays and blog entries on
              "yesterday.sg" and "good morning yesterday" etc but will
              definitely appreciate more details that can help give us a
              better picture of what it was like then.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">Lastly, I can also be
              contacted directly at josensim@gmail.com if anyone wishes to get in touch with
              me! If you have any information that you think can prove to be useful to our production, we will be very grateful to hear from you too!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">Any help will be much appreciated! Many thanks for all your time and we hope to hear from you!</span></p>

              <p>Hmm.. For this question, i would suggest to use a Volvo Olympian 2-Axle (No-Air Conditioned bus) from what ngjy22 said earlier.</p>
              <p>If you do not know how the bus looks like, it looks something like this (quick shot):<br><img style="border: 0; margin: 1px;" src="http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll198/joeyjoeybooboo_2008/SBSNACbus.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="367"></p>
              <p>The interior of the bus looks something like this:<br><img style="border: 0; margin: 1px;" src="http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll198/joeyjoeybooboo_2008/Interior.jpg" alt="" width="484" height="362"><br><img style="border: 0; margin: 1px;" src="http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll198/joeyjoeybooboo_2008/DSC01358.jpg" alt="" width="481" height="359"></p>
              <p>If this bus doesnt look 'old' for you, you should consider seeing those old single-decker Mercedes private buses.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">I'll like to introduce myself as Wenxiang, a producer from Threesixzero Productions, a local TV production company.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;"><span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times;">We are currently producing an eight-part documentary series “Say Goodbye"</span> <span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">ã€Š</span><span style="font-family: FZZhunYuan-M02S;">è¯´</span><span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">å†�</span><span style="font-family: FZZhunYuan-M02S;">è§�</span><span style="font-family: HanWangHeiHeavy;">ã€‹</span><span style="font-family: Times;">for Channel 8 slated to air end of the year</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;"><span>For one of the episodes, we are featuring a 65-year-old SBS bus captain who is retiring after 45 years in service. For purpose of filming, we wonder if we can possibly enlist your kind assistance with a few enquiries:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">1. Will anyone know of any old refurbished buses which interiors are still intact? We had a look at three: the one at the youth park opposite Heeren, another attached to Pat's Schoolhouse at Jubilee Park and the last one which have been converted into a mobile library. However for all three, the seats have been removed. Does anyone know of a disused bus which interiors are somewhat preserved in their original conditions?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">2. To re-enact some of the scenes when our bus captain was still a bus conductor with the then Singapore Traction Company, we wonder if anyone may have in their possessions certain memorabilia associated with the era and are kind enough to make us a loan of them for filming? Almost anything will prove to be useful to us but we are on a special lookout for items such as bus tickets, the ticket puncher and money bag that are part of the bus conductor's get-up, and the khaki uniforms etc etc.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">3. Lastly, will any one have any old photos or even any film/videos that can help us relive the evolution of Singapore's public bus transport system over the last 60-70 years, i.e. from trams and trolley buses to the STC monopoly to the establishment of SBS. Will anyone know of any books or text dealing with the history of our public buses? We have gone through most of the essays and blog entries on "yesterday.sg" and "good morning yesterday" etc but will definitely appreciate more details that can help give us a better picture of what it was like then.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">Lastly, I can also be contacted directly at josensim@gmail.com if anyone wishes to get in touch with me! If you have any information that you think can prove to be useful to our production, we will be very grateful to hear from you too!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;">Any help will be much appreciated! Many thanks for all your time and we hope to hear from you!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times;">Best,</span></p>

              <p>SBS Transit has one existing bus (air-conditioned) in its original
                  condition. SBS777T, a Volvo B10M Mark III (1993). Its a training bus,
                  if you are already in touch with SBST's Corp Comms, this shouldn't take
                  much extra effort. This bus, however, is in the OMO era.</p>
              <p>If
                  you want the interior just for the conductor scene, your best bet is a
                  private operator. If you really need the actual ones at any cost,old B57s (1980s) have been exported to New Zealand to continue as schoolbuses. There are also old SBS buses exported overseas, a few in the hands of preservation groups (a 1970 Olympian in the UK); Singapore has not have the kind of funding for a preservation society unlike other countries.</p>
              <p>To be honest, this is one of the worst times to actually
                  film about old buses. A year ago, there are actually a lot of old buses
                  still available, which now they have been spent for scrap.</p>

              <p>There is a ex-SBS aircon double decker bus given to Police Tatical Training Camp at Mandai for training use. Maybe you can go take and take a look?</p>
