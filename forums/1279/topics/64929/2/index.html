Everything that SBST did, they sure have their reasons. So sometimes unless the situation gets really bad, we can just sit and wait for SBST to take action. If currently they don't have the resources to improve on their services, complaining infinity times won't help abit.</div>

Yes, you can defend yourself by saying that they don't meet up to <strong>YOUR</strong> standards.
