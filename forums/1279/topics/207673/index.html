I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  all the way through. I believe that, at one point, we reached 80 Km/H, and we were rushing down the second and third lanes of the expressway from Toa Payoh through Ang Mo Kio.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Trip 2, Tuesday, 15082006, evening peak hour, an unknown Mercedes MB O405 Hispano</span></strong><br><br>Yet another crazily fast trip down Central Expressway, which I suspect was by the same driver as above. You may think it may not be as crazy as the trip above, since this one was on a rigid bus (bus was still quite packed though), but once you factor in the fact that, at one point, we were in the second <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>most lane, and was as fast as an SUV in the <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>most lane, you know this one is even more insane.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Both trips were in the direction towards Yishun.[/b]</blockquote>If an accident is to happen like a sudden slow down, those standing could potentially be flung out of the bus!!! Someone one of the incident is a bendy... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

But still i got take one n113 feel it's speeding. Some can hear the speed limiter working(or the bc becoming the speed limiter).

It was packed to the door and I was standing next to the driver. I saw the speedometer read over 70km/h along the AYE!
