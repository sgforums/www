            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Which bus company's buses do you think provide better comfort?<br><br>For me, I seem to feel that the TIBs buses are more comfortable and I enjoy riding one for long distances (provided the bus does not have many passengers.). I especially like the Mercedes 0405 ones.<br>Strangely, the same 0405 (exactly the same?) buses for the SBS will give me  the desire to vomit... perhaps it is the ride and the overall atmosphere of the bus...<br><br>Opinions, please. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>WJTW</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends. Both companies have their own share of comfortable and uncomfortable buses.<br><br>For example, Hispano 0405s are good for long haul on TIBS, i once took a 1.5hr ride on TIB971E on 963 from end to end and ended up with a very sore butt at the end due to the seats. For SBST, VO3Axs and Mk5s are made for sleeping, esp the mk5s, many of them are much more queiter when travelling at high speeds compared to TIBS 0405s.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>For long haul, i will definitely avoid lances to keep myself sane, as they have very violent and sharp gear changes, and quite a few retatrders are not even working ( imagine hearing ping pianging of the handles knocking against the poles whenever it hits a bump for 1hr ). For the malaysian lances, the suspension needs improvement, and the UK lance badly requires a holiday in Antartica to cool itself down. While it might be true that the Cummins engine are very reliable, they are meant for utilitarian vehicles in the first place, not for city buses.<br><br></div>
