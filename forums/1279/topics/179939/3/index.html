            <div class='col-md body'>guess he does not know Singapore well and always get lost while taking bus, so blaming on the advertisement loh.<br><br>Further, the picture quality taken by HP cant be comparable to those taken by digital camera. The photo size maybe only 40K, while those taken by digital camera come up to 1MB. Why dun try taking using a digital camera?</div>
