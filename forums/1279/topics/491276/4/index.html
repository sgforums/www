              <p>Even though I voted for bus A, objectively speaking I feel bus B
              will mlbe more popular among SGreans... Coz SGreans like to see
              change, and there are plenty on the A95 <span style="line-height: 1.231;">concept, from the bus bells to the middle
              stairs and exit door config... I overheard ppl saying bus A seemed
              "old-fashioned", " nothing new" and "reminds me of London Bus"...
              For a second people even thought the empty spac</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">es on bus A is " for luggage"...</span></p>
              <p>I feel they also may like Bus B's brighter, sleekier and more
              stylish interior... To me I rather ADL as it feels more calm and
              relaxing... </p>
              <p>Also Bus B still does not solve the problem of people not moving
              to the rear at the lower deck... But at least now there are less
              standing space behind...</p>
              <p>My brother (not a bus fan) pointed out a legit design flaw in
              the exit door barrier... People in the lower deck could actl pass
              through easily, they simply need to pull back on the barrier... So
              I'm not sure about its effectiveness after all...</p>

              <p>Not sure what sort of dwelling time problems are there in the bendy buses; they spend a lot less time dwelling at bus stops than traditional double deckers, and just spend a slightly longer time than 12m single deckers at busy stops. Bendy buses will still have a lesser dwell time than any of the two concept buses as passengers don't have stairs to climb, which makes for faster boarding and alighting.</p>

              <p>Bus A second stairs all the way at the back, will people at the
                  front upper deck feel the need to use the second stairs all the way
                  at the back or will they still use the original stairs? It defeats
                  the purpose of a second stairs if people going down will still use
                  the front stairs due to lack of convenience to access the second
                  stairs. The second stairs on Bus A may more likely be used by
                  passengers to move up (in addition to front stairs) compared to Bus
                  B's second stairs ('gantry'), creating a second (but perhaps less
                  concentrated) bottleneck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least, with Bus B's second stairs which is more to the
                  middle, people will have more incentive to use it, coupled with the
                  fact that its an exit exclusively for exiting the upper deck. The
                  'gantry' prevents the second set of stairs and third door from
                  being abused by lower deck people.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Interesting view, what it could mean is that more people will likely use the front stairs to alight on the ADL than on the MAN due to the stair catchment areas (ADL's rear stairs cover less areas/pax than MAN's), the same old problem of a bottleneck at the bottom of the front stairs as seen on normal double deckers will be more prominent on the ADL than on the MAN.</p>

              <p>LTA has already given up on the usage of articulated buses because of space constraints in the expanding bus industry and demands. They will be eventually removed from service in the near future. </p>
              <p>Actually other than 858, other airport services are able to handle the demands. I would hope that another airport service from Woodlands to ease the demands of 858 and provide a faster link to the airport.

              <p>It will be great if Bus B entrance and first exit doors are separate leaf door configurations, using the traditional swing in doors like the ones now for the entrance doors. The bigger doors of the MAN bus concept would be harder to maintain and easier to dislodge. </p>

              <p>The concept buses might be a tad longer but that doesn't mean that LTA is buying anymore longer buses, else they will be looking into 14.5 to 15 m single deckers. </p>
              <p>While at 13m, the concept buses have higher capacity, taking up lesser spaces and addresses the issue of longer dwell times with a second staircase and a third door. These improvements, as intended by LTA, has addressed the problems of longer dwell times for double deckers. </p>
              <p>If furthertechnological advances in future can make engine and air con compressors smaller, they can stored under the staircases and make the buses even shorter.</p>

              <p>Bro 13m and 18.5m is a huge difference though bendy buses turning radius is better but again spacing is more precious in SG.How to fit 3 doors dual staircase into tri-axles DD you tell me?Dismantle all seats ah?</p>
