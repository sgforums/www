              <p>The two back doors at bus B are two single doors installed side-by-side, right?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I feel that this thread has already served its original purpose of discussing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">event</span>.</p>
              <p>We can continue to use thread to discuss the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">event</span>.</p>
              <p>For discussions about the livery and the new features, I think it's better that we discuss at the other thread, titled "<a href="/forums/1279/topics/491485?page=1"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Our new public bus livery will be lush green!</span></span></strong></a>".</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> Unlike the similar threads, this thread is to consolidate and discuss what is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confirmed</span> to be incorporated into our public buses.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> The original purpose for creating that thread is to inform everyone about the new public bus livery, as I feel that it is newsworthy. Subsequently, I feel that it can be used to discuss the future of our buses that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confirmed</span>. In fact, we should consolidate everything there, rather than have discussions scattered all over the forum (ie. this thread on bus carnival, that thread on tender for concept buses, that thread on gcm, etcetera).</p>

              <p>I am sorry, but I feel that the LTA may have a hidden agenda for organising this carnival. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> I do not think it is really about explaining in technical terms or collecting feedback (the iPads tend to refresh by itself, making it quite hard to write the messages in the feedback form). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"> Neither is it really about hiring new employees in the bus industry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"> Likewise for the carnival TT organised last year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
                              <p>Although SGforums does not have amazing race, I feel that the public events organised by the LTA and the PTOs have brought us together; some of you have seen me, while I have seen some of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>Even though I voted for bus A, objectively speaking I feel bus B will mlbe more popular among SGreans... Coz SGreans like to see change, and there are plenty on the A95 <span style="line-height: 1.231;">concept, from the bus bells to the middle stairs and exit door config... I overheard ppl saying bus A seemed "old-fashioned", " nothing new" and "reminds me of London Bus"... For a second people even thought the empty spac</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">es on bus A is " for luggage"...</span></p>
              <p>I feel they also may like Bus B's brighter, sleekier and more stylish interior... To me I rather ADL as it feels more calm and relaxing... </p>
              <p>Also Bus B still does not solve the problem of people not moving to the rear at the lower deck... But at least now there are less standing space behind...</p>
              <p>My brother (not a bus fan) pointed out a legit design flaw in the exit door barrier... People in the lower deck could actl pass through easily, they simply need to pull back on the barrier... So I'm not sure about its effectiveness after all...</p>

              <p>Bus A second stairs all the way at the back, will people at the front upper deck feel the need to use the second stairs all the way at the back or will they still use the original stairs? It defeats the purpose of a second stairs if people going down will still use the front stairs due to lack of convenience to access the second stairs. The second stairs on Bus A may more likely be used by passengers to move up (in addition to front stairs) compared to Bus B's second stairs ('gantry'), creating a second (but perhaps less concentrated) bottleneck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least, with Bus B's second stairs which is more to the middle, people will have more incentive to use it, coupled with the fact that its an exit exclusively for exiting the upper deck. The 'gantry' prevents the second set of stairs and third door from being abused by lower deck people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am surprised no one has pointed out the longer rear overhang of Bus A. Of course this will increase rear sweep when exiting bus stop (I know it has rear axle steering but still), compared to the Bus B. I think this can be attributed that Bus A was a 12m bus extended to 13m by merely making the rear overhang longer while Bus B is a native 12.8m bus, not needing any extensions but only radical changes in thinking and second stairs and third door positioning.</p>

              <p>there must be a reason why they didn't use the 12.8m chassis, there wouldn't be any space to fit a third door/second stairs with all the rear components, so they opted to extend the rear overhang of a 12m bus.</p>

              <p>Else why they design the centre/rear door side by side?I strongly feel that ADL/Volvo has the edge in building DDs more than MAN.Not saying MAN is lousy but theyre more expertise in rigid and bendy buses more than DD.</p>
