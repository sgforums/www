              <p>Thats for the concept bus project/tender. It is of no indication of the actual cost of the bus, as costs such as R&amp;D, design and other one time costs will be included.</p>
              <p>I have no idea about the actual price of a regular bus, maybe lemon1974 will know which double deck is cheaper in terms of regular production batches?</p>

              <p>T5 will have one, but I don't feel its exactly 'centralized', disappointing. I agree that they could have really done some sort of centralized bus terminal with Jewel, also taking into account the fact that it is also a skytrain hub.</p>

              <p>I did ask several SMRT personnels regarding new bendy buses whether its from their own purchase or LTA funded..LTA wont funded SMRT with bendy buses but SMRT can only purchased at lower amount.Examples 2 O405Gs scrapped replace with a A24,But again SMRT reluctant to purchase further and just wait and see what the concept buses has to offer.Right now bus purchasing is under LTA already,You see how many O405Gs is refurbish till LTA purchased the concept buses..And everything is almost uncertain with the GCM.</p>
