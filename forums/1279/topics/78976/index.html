            <div class='col-md body'>Jurong Rd is old, very old. I think it was built at the turn of the last century. It started from Bt Timah Rd (opp Bt Timah Fire Station) and ended at Jln Boon Lay. From there onwards to Tuas Village, it is known as Upp Jurong Rd.<br><br>Let's begin the story of Jurong Rd first. The original road was narrow and very winding. A newer road was built which was slightly wider and straighter. This new road included some portions of the old road. Parts of the old road which were excluded from the 'upgrading' were renamed Old Jurong Rd. Eventually, Old Jurong Rd ceased to exist. However, one small portion is still visible today. It is now within Bt Batok Nature Park and used as a jogging track.<br><br>Jurong Rd underwent another major change with the development of Bt Batok New Town. The portion between Jln Jurong Kechil to Blk 210 was renamed as Bt Batok East Ave 6. From there on to Bt Batok Rd, it was deleted. Now there's 2 Jurong Rd, one on each end of Bt Batok. To avoid confusion, the one starting from Bt Timah Rd was renamed Old Jurong Rd.<br><br>Jurong Rd did not become a part of the PIE (except for one tiny portion near Jln Boon Lay). The PIE was built parellel to it. Jurong West Ave 2 was formerly a part of the PIE. Jurong Rd was cut short to Hong Kah Flyover during the PIE extension. The disused portion will eventually disappear with the future development of Jurong West N2.</div>
