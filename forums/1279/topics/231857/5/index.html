            <div class='col-md body'>the first few stops right out of some interchanges or terminals consistently gives inaccurate readings. so far amk and bishan kena.... the bus may switch to arriving out of nowhere but it is actually still 10 mins away (listed as subsequent)... sometimes both are listed as arriving or bunching...<br><br>2 possibilities conjectured.....<br><br>1. nextbus sub-system is not "talking" properly to the nextdep sub-system at the interchanges. nextdep most likely got its info from the individual interchanges about the next departure times the computer assigns to the next bus driver, which means the info is about a trip that has yet to commence.<br><br>however, nextbus uses info based on a trip that has commenced and tracks it while it is on the road. when bunching occurs on nextbus for bus stops just after the int/ter (arriving/2mins), it is probably nextdep giving a timing for nextdep and nextbus using its own tracking, producing 2 timings, which will be rectified down the route as nextbus determines the position of the bus (and eliminates the duplicate).<br><br>2. there may be buses that end trips at the interchanges/terminals but has details of the next trip set. by right DDU/nextdep shld be smart enough to know how many minutes before the commencement of the next trip, but nextbus may start indicating 2mins or arriving on top of timings given to it by nextdep (which is more accurate here), which may appear as the subsequent bus.<br><br>if 2 buses are parking at the interchange, nextbus may start detecting it as arriving/2mins, arriving/arriving or 2mins/2mins, which pushes the timing given by nextdep out of projected timings.<br><br>for stops which are somewhere down the route, such issues do not happen, and it is very very accurate, even displaying bunching like the bus 64 incident described above.<br><br>for example, at the bus stop opposite bishan MRT, svcs 13, 88 and 156 give accurate timings while 52, 54, 55 and 58 keeps having an unknown "arriving" trip interfereing with the data from time to time.<br><br>will need more investigations, but if SBST will ever want to put up panels at popular stops for demos and awareness campaigns, Somerset MRT is a good place where it works well because the profile of the road before it is pretty straightforward (one straight road) and it does not have the problem described above associated with stops close to interchanges and terminals.<br><br>another thing is the timing of 174 (town bound) which tends to early i.e. bus arriving 2-4 mins after the arriving flag is up and over.<br><br>one more observation from bus stop after rifle range rd along dunearn rd (42059): the evening peak after NP causes buses to be stuck with Arriving for a few minutes, then it promptly jumps to the timing of the bus behind as it assumes the bus may have passed the stop without stopping, before jumping back to Arriving when the bus has finally arrived 2 to 4 mins after first instance of Arriving flag. this is alright since it is due to 'external' causes outside the system's control.</div>

It shows 12 mins and seq bus at 13 min. I took the 12th min bus, alight at Hougang Festival Market. And I waited like for 10 min, never see the so called seq bus of 13 min arrive. So is it cock up again? Detecting one bus twice?</div></blockquote>i think if u refresh again later, the 13th minute bus wll stay at 13 mins until it comes out of the interchange. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think impossible too.<br><br>My stop is like a few stop after kovan. And if the bus need to go to kovan it needs at least 20 mins.<br><br>So if it show 12 and 13, it mean the bus 2 and bus 1 is different by 1 min right?<br><br>Then the bus 2 should be somewhere behind?<br><br>Unless I am wrong in the caculation?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This system... so far so good...<br><br>1. Braddell Rd (Blk 219)<br>Service: 13<br>Response: 5 min<br>Actual: 6 min<br>Reason: There was an accident just after the bus stop I was at. Left lane blocked. Only centre and right lanes passable..<br>Verdict: Pass<br><br>2. Toa Payoh Lor 2 (Toa Payoh Stn)<br>Service: 105<br>Response: 11 min / 20 min<br>Actual: 12 min<br>Reason: Maybe its my watch giving problems. Always come later 1min than the actual time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Verdict: Pass<br><br>Additional Info: That '20min' bus caught up with the '11min' bus at Napier Rd. Should have did another check just before the earlier bus came at my boarding stop.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>3. Orchard Rd (Thai Embassy)<br>Service: 36<br>Response: 3 min / 17min<br>Actual: N.A<br>Reason: The response was for the bus stop at Tanglin Rd (After Tomlinson Rd) Technically speaking an addition of 4min to my current stop will do.. So take it 21min.<br><br>1648hrs - Time of Query<br>1709hrs - Where is the bus?<br>1715hrs - Run 2nd query from current bus stop (Response: 2 min / 10 min)<br>1717hrs - The bus is late by 8 min from my first query.<br><br>Verdict: Fail. Then again 36 is erratic anyway <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> The bus was already behind schedule and its unusual for this bus to get packed to the brim at 1745hrs at Suntec. The crowd usually get in after 1815hrs. Poor driver.<br></div>
