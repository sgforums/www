            <div class='col-md body'>It was a great trip !!!<br><br>We could have taken 9815 and 9817 , the 2 bus services i missed out beside 9800A  so far  .  We had to settle for 9817 .<br><br>I met Fang Sheng at Bishan Mrt at 2 pm , We saw 9815 on the monitor screen and I was absolutely delighted . But to our disgust  , the bus didnt stop for us and instead left the terminal and turned right ( presumely back to depot ) . I was disappointed but few minutes later , we saw another VSO coming in and guess what ? Its 9817C !!!! Not so bad afterall ,  This time the VSO didnt run away from us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  . We took the bus down to Marina Centre . At marina centre,  we decided to try our luck and wait for either 9800A (hopefully on 501 ) or 2888T on bus 518 . We waited for quite some time and decided to take Trident 9689E  on 501 to Sengkang .<br><br>At Sengkang we took a short break before continuing our journey , nothing special at all . We decided to take Volgren Mercedes (TIB972) to Woodlands . Fang Sheng told me this is the last bus of the Volgren fleet , I was absolutely exciting with the bus . This is definately one of my favourite single deck bus . Smooth , fast and quiet engine . This is what I call a 21st century bus !!<br>Anyway , we enjoyed the bus ride tremendously , it didnt took long before reaching woodlands mrt .  Fang Sheng saw Volgren bendy bus on 169 and then we decided to take 169 to  Ang Mo Kio . Spotting the usual Nissan diesel , Elbo , Mercedes buses at Woodlands , we took a short break before queueing up at 169 queue .  We skipped a Dennis Lance 245 ( Fang Sheng told me the driver loves to speed ) . and then our bus Volgren Bendy bus  Mercedes (1178 ) came . We took the bus all the way to amk . We chatted most of the time and didnt take notice the buses passed us .<br><br>When we reached AMK .  It was so boring . No Vso buses , no bendy bus for Fang Sheng except for the bus we took , we planned to take the same bus back to Woodlands but found out that the bus was heading back to Woodlands Depot . Fang Sheng decided to wait for a Habit bus which he saw on the way to AMK on 169 route . I love hearing engine startings and heard quite a few  . There was this bus 269 (mercedes converted air con bus ) parked in front and with its engine off , we stood there watching guiness world of record while waiting for other buses to come . We spotted 9633 on bus 166 and 2 LO buses and 2 Mercedes on 133 (Heehee Jack ) . 1 Mercedes orginial (TIB) bus came but FS decided to skip that bus and wait for the bendy bus , the habit bus came but to be disappointed , the bus headed back to Depot . I guess the long buses disappear at night . Anyway , after that disappointment ,  we saw bus 22 in DM Volvo bus 985 , that is bus 22 !!!  I saw the happy face of the bus driver  and he didnt mind Fang Sheng taking a photo of that bus .<br><br>Anyway , I was lucky to board the bus to bedok reservoir where I changed for bus 21 (2629 ) home !!<br><br>What a great trip .<br><br>Thanks for reading my report .</div>
