They are all Voith-ed, same as the DM3500. The bodywork that's used on Scania, Mercs and MKIIs is called the Alexander PS . Yeap like what you said, same model, only fitted on different chassis.<br><br>Btw you should ask before confirming your answer. You should have said "Erm, do we have MKIIIs?" The way you mentioned "We didnt have any MkIIIs isn't it?" might cause you to be scolded by the seniors.

On top of that, many buses that were considered experimental or unusual during that time were also brought in (the first air-conditioned buses, buses with EDSes, low-floor buses, bendy buses, etc.).<br><br>Now, it seems like we are on the verge of another Golden Age of New Buses. This time round, WAB will be the new concept, and I foresee that later on, buses that run on alternative fuels will also be brought in (we already have 12 CNG buses, and with hydrogen and CNG the way to go to replace our dependency on fossil fuels, I don't see why this won't happen).</div></blockquote>I refer to those buses brought in between 1987 and 1993 as "Generation PS". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
