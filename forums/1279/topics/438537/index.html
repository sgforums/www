              personally, i like kubs better,
              1. colder acs
              2. bigger
              3. nice headlights
              4. when you stand beside the bus, you dont feel the heat much
              
              why i hate citaros :
              1. warm-cold acs (sometimes a/c not working)
              2. lesser seats
              3. hot engine when you stand beside it

              <p>Irrelevant question to me....cos they are above my likes and dislikes as they are my necessities.</p>
              <p>But I generally dislike non-aircon air-conditioned buses, teeth-chattering buses, and jerky rides (you should ask instead which BCs to avoid and I'll gladly point them out).</p>
              <p>The main thing that sets them apart in my opinion is the layout, in that respect, I'll pick the KUB over the Citaro. Its more roomy in general....but thin sheets of aluminium just don't cut it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I'd pick the Citaro anytime. The KUBs are just horrid, even the Euro 4 ones. I rather suffer the stuffiness of the Citaro then risk falling everytime I'm on the KUB. Its rocking suspension is just the tip of the iceberg. The radiator's damn loud and irritating (gives the impression of being powerless), the gearbox changes too early, making the bus vibrate as the RPMs are too low and the whole bus just feels cheap. Somehow the radiator howling also gives the feeling of increased inertia and gear jerks. I know there are bits on the Citaro that aren't working, but the Citaros exude class, elegance and refinement, which the KUB lacks. The only time when the KUB can try to redeem itself is when it's being revved high. I like the turbo whistle at about 2500rpm.</p></div>

              <p>Well, the beauty of a bus chassis is very well shown in the kub, you can customise everything that u would like. Dont like Scania? take a MAN, else, take a Mercedes Benz, or if not, take a Volvo. Full Low floor for accessiblity, or Low entry for seats, up to you to pick. And also the engine and drivetrain can be selected.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, you just need a coachbuilder to build a suitable body to what you would want. Just for the kub, you can already choose from a very wide variety from something that's solid like Hispano, or Caetano, Custom Coaches, Volgren, Gemilang, SC Auto and etc. You could also have all sorts of different makes and models, and just have a single coachbuilder to build it all, using the exact same specification so the most can be saved from maintaience. And also all the interior layouts you'd want.</p>
              <p>But compared to a integral product, its not easy to find a body that fits as well. Some examples, OC's mirror are too high and the sl has to always look up, or the dm body on lances, etc.</p>
              <p>An analogy to put this, compare a diy PC built from components at sim lim square and a complete product from apple, hp, dell, acer, etc. You can get a very customised casing and components when u diy, but in terms of support, will it be as hassle free as a complete product?</p>

              <p>As for the citaro, i do believe the air conditioning issues will be resolved soon.</p>
              <p>And for the layout, smrt/sbst have a choice to change it to something better, just that they are not using this choice.</p>
              <p>If you want a rear similar to the kub, they could pick a Citaro LE which is basically something similar to a integral OC500LE, but with the front independent suspension that gives the Citaro the smooth turns.</p>
              <p>This is a example from Qbuzz taken by some chap on imageshack.</p>
              <p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/341/dscf6089.jpg">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/341/dscf6089.jpg</a>/</p>
              <p>Otherwise if u want more walkway space at the front, this is another example from the new 2011 Citaro.</p>
              <p>Notice the seats on the door side are only single seats, similar to some of our O405Gs.</p>

              <p>Image from MB's press kit.</p>
              <p>So as you can see, the operators could well modify the seating layout, but its not being done yet.</p>

              <p>Is it me or does the Citaro 1st gear feel kind of 'slow'? I hear the engine working rather hard but the bus doesn't seem to move very quickly. I only feel the acceleration after the 1st gear.</p>

              <p>I'd pick the Citaro anytime. The KUBs are just horrid, even the
              Euro 4 ones. I rather suffer the stuffiness of the Citaro then risk
              falling everytime I'm on the KUB. Its rocking suspension is just
              the tip of the iceberg. The radiator's damn loud and irritating
              (gives the impression of being powerless), the gearbox changes too
              early, making the bus vibrate as the RPMs are too low and the whole
              bus just feels cheap. Somehow the radiator howling also gives the
              feeling of increased inertia and gear jerks. I know there are bits
              on the Citaro that aren't working, but the Citaros exude class,
              elegance and refinement, which the KUB lacks. The only time when
              the KUB can try to redeem itself is when it's being revved high. I
              like the turbo whistle at about 2500rpm.</p>

              <p>The Citaro gearboxes also seem to change too early (especially to 4th gear) from my own personal observation... I often hear the gearbox going down a gear because the engine can't provide enough power (is this the correct way to say this?). Plus there's a jolt when it goes from 1st to 2nd gear.</p>
              <p>I prefer the ZF gearbox because it's kinda nice to listen to :)</p>

              <p>IMO. I stillÂ prefer the KUBs much more than Citaros.</p>
              <p>For KUBS, the front space is very spacious and seem to be able to squeeze in many passengers. Also, I find the walkway aisle of the KUB rear a little more spacious than Citaros. And I love the high ceilings of the KUBs and it looks elegant. I don't bother of the steps along the walkway leading to the rear of the KUBs; as I still prefer in this manner than the Citaros where I got to climb up the steps from the walkway onto the seat instead.</p>
              <p>When I'm seating on the outer seat that is opposite the back-facing seats, I got a little worried when the bus is moving, because there is no poles or seat handles in front of me to hold on to. Also, as there is a step between the outer seats and walking aisle, I also got a little worried when the bus is turning, as I can't place my legs a little more onto the walkway to better balance myself; unlike the KUBs.</p>
              <p>But I dislike the KUBs jerking during acceleration and braking. However, some KUBs have probably been fine-tuned; andÂ combined with good KUB bus captains' driving skills, have made travelling on KUBs much more pleasant. So I hope SBST and Scania can work further together to improve the KUBs and better train the BCs to make our journeys more pleasant.</p>
