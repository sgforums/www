It depends on time frequency, traffic constraints, supplementary short trips, meal breaktimes and their time intervals need to be proceeded through the computer tracing the movement of the buses on the road.<br><br>However, the schedule can be affected due to some problems:<br><br>1) Not enought drivers (some applied for leave, sick, family matter, etc...)<br>2) Bus breakdown (This leads to the second bus<br>3) Traffic constraints according to the busy route such as Orchard Rd and other affected roads etc...<br>4) Lack of technical practises when EZ-Link readers are out of order.<br><br>Some drivers are experienced *yawn* SURE drive slowly like a tortoise or what else....

If according to your theory, the bus behind, let's say it overtakes and end up as the first bus behind, so taking the first bus may be slower, as he may want to help his colleague out by slowing down a bit. Don't forget that the first bus at ur bus stop is ahead of his timetable, so he have to slow down somewhere cos he have to enter the interchange on schedule. Same goes for the last one, but I will agree with u to take the last one, bus is much riskier cos he may not stop seeing there were 2 buses in front , esp since he is in a rush. Also, SBST seems to have a policy that prevents buses from bunching, so they will try to spread out, like 74.</div>
