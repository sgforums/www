              <p>858 doesn't turn into Gambas Ave from Woodlands Ave 7. It turns
              into Gambas from Woodlands Ave 9 (i.e. when it leaves WRI it takes
              Woodlands Ave 7, Ave 4, Ave 9 and then Gambas). Rather, it will now
              turn into Ave 7 from Gambas.</p>
              <p>It's new route leaving WRI now will be:</p>
              <p>WRI, Ave 7, Ave 4, Ave 9, Gambas Ave, Ave 7, Sembawang Way, SBW
              MRT, Canberra Rd, Sembawang Rd and then continue on as normal.</p>

              <p>What are they thinking??? 858 already has poor frequencies and overloading during peak hours and travelling from Woodlands to Changi Airport takes at least 1h 15mins. Now they are extending it to make travelling time longer to the airport for North bound commuters. What kind of planning is this???</p>
              <p>Rather LTA should extend 965 instead, which has only 27 stages to Sengkang as compared to 858's 43 stages to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>Proposed 965 route.</p>
              <p>From WRI:</p>
              <p>Woodlands Ave 7, Sembawang Way, Canberra Rd, Sembawang Rd, Yishun Ave 7, Yishun Ave 2, Yishun Central, Yishun Central 1 (New bus stops Opp&amp;Outside BLK 921, BLK 932), Yishun Central 2, Yishun St 61 (New bus stop outside BLK 605 and Chung Cheng High Sch), Yishun Ring Road, Yishun Ave 2, then proceed the usual route to Sengkang.</p>

              <p>This amendment is an effort between the constituency and SMRT to improve links after residents request for a service to the east.

              <p><br>FYI, I am a frequent commuter of 858, especially to Woodlands Ave 9. So that's why I proposed the 965 amendment, since it has the lowest passenger capacity and shortest fare stages for 858, 965 and 969. And travelling in 858 from Changi Airport already takes more than an hour (Yishun at least 40 mins), even if the BCs have speeded along TPE. Demand and traffic conditions are especially high along Yishun Ave 2, Chong Pang and Woodlands. Especially during evening peak, the queues in Changi Airport can be two times longer than the queue along the normal ones, and waiting times can be up to 13 to 15 mins. Worst still, TPE along Sengkang can be jammed for some days in the morning peak.</p>
              <p>Proposal of 965 also gives Sembawang residents another faster choice to the east and so they can choose a variety of services to the East and Northeast. In addition, it does not call at Jln Kayu bus stops, which is faster.</p>
              <p>And initially I also thought of service 811, Khatib bound route to extended to the new hospital, leaving from Yishun Central, Yishun Central 2, Yishun Ring Rd and proceed to Yishun Ave 2. The extended route looks too intentionally to be re routed to the new hospital, which can at least increase the whole trip by another 10 to 12 minutes, given that it has to cross 2 traffic lights, 1 bus stop and 2 slip roads.</p>
              <p>I appreciate the improvements, so I took the initative to even map out the roads to propose a better alternative than 858. I give my suggestions with supporting claims because I am a frequent commuter on 858, not empty talks. </p>

              <p>Please note that you're not the only person who "commutes frequently" on 858. I have a couple of friends that live in Sembawang that are currently doing part-time jobs at the Airport. For them travelling to the Airport currently can be a nightmare. 859 waiting times are not very good during off-peak and they have to mix with Yishun passengers at Blk 923 bus stop for 858. They can of course go to Woodlands and take 168 and transfer again, but because they are not using concessionary travel it means paying alot more. Just because Sembawang seems cut off from the other parts of Singapore doesn't mean it should not benefit from a direct route to the Airport, should it?</p>
              <p>The very purpose of Jalan Kayu is to serve as an interchange point. 858 &gt; 39 brings Sembawang residents to Pasir Ris in no time. 858 &gt; 103 brings them to Serangoon straight, changing to 86 brings them to Ang Mo Kio or Sengkang. If you omit Jalan Kayu as an interchange point, then where do you expect them to change buses?</p>
              <p>And lastly, the small diversion into KTP hospital does not take 10 minutes, seriously. I wonder how you estimate it to be 10 minutes. -___-" The most it would do is 5 minutes, probably 3 minutes on average.</p>

              <p>If you are saying TPE will jam, what's the point of even amending 965 as you've said?</p>
              <p>You are saying that a transfer from 965 at Sengkang to the East is faster, given that the frequencies of buses at Sengkang to East isn't that good as well. Not to mention 965 can have even worse frequency than 858.</p>
              <p>From your reply I really don't see that you "appreciate" the amendment, or even thinking of Sembawang residents. Your first line of "what are they thinking" already strongly suggest you are faulting the amendment.</p>
              <p>I suggest you can talk to the people who had fought for the convenience of the Sembawang residents and bring up your grievance. Hopefully they will be able to convince you. Simply because I know the rest of us can't.</p>
