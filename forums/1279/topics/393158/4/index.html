Those in SBW (Like me) now have better more efficient choices on how to get to places. To PSR? 858 to Jln Kayu and transfer to other services. Tampines? Depending on where in Tampines, either to Yishun and take 969 or again, at Jln Kayu and transfer. Want to go airport? No need transfer bus. Want to go Expo? Go CGA and transfer to 24. The extension opens up more possibilities for us here, and really, once you have lived all your life in an SMRT area, you don't mind the packed or late buses.</p>

              <p>On paper, it looks perfect. After all, SMRT rarely executes such wonderful service enhancements.</p>
              <p>TIBS took the pains to ensure its bus journeys do not exceed one hour end-to-end but all SMRT does is to ruin all this in its efforts to maximise profits. To pass through one other town sounds fair enough. Woodlands residents can surely live with a "via Bukit Panjang" (think 966) or "via Yishun" if the total journey time is still reasonable. But yes, SMRT loves to test our limits and now we have a super combo of "via Sembawang and Yishun". This is simply too much.</p>
              <p>I do not buy the reason that the amendment is to improve Sembawang's connections to the east. Changi Airport is too out of the way to be used as a transit point for those heading to other destinations in the east. Especially when there is a comprehensive 859 linking the whole of the town to Yishun, from which you have 39, 85, 854, 965, 969.</p>
              <p>If you're really talking east, you're talking 969. But SMRT knows the backlash it will receive from Woodlands and Yishun residents from such an amendment would far outweigh the benefits it would seek to gain from Sembawang.</p>
              <p>Personally, I would rather have 965 serve Sembawang. Already this service pales in performance compared to 858 and 969. Its route is short and frequency sucks. So it would have been a win-win situation as frequency will be boosted, it will find more use in having higher loads to/from Sengkang to make up for what it has lost to 85, and total journey time can still be within an hour.</p>
              <p>Surely SMRT would have been tempted to carry out such an amendment. But somehow it just didn't; perhaps it is still bound to the 2:1 town territorial ruling, which 858 is exempted from. In fact, if 965 was to take up 858's amended route, it would have created a wonderful connection between Sengkang and KTP Hospital. After all,  KTP has been touted to be sited in Yishun in the first place due to its proximity to both the northern and northeastern towns. And the best part? Sembawang's intertown links will still be enhanced, while 858's journey time will remain unaffected.</p>
              <p>And as if Sembawang is not enough, there's KTP. Yes, it's a vital link bla bla bla but we all know that 858's chosen as it would be the one and only service linking Woodlands and Sembawang (and Yishun) to the hospital without having to introduce or amend the other routes. Amending 965 or 969 would have been stupid as it would have left Sembawang with no link to KTP.</p>
              <p>But please la, wouldn't a dedicated WAB shuttle service be more efficient in ferrying visitors to the KTP and back from Yishun Int/MRT? Imagine a packed 858 from Changi Airport with majority alighting at Yishun MRT, trying to pack in even more visitors from KTP. I just hope SMRT will amend 811 or something before such a situation starts to develop.</p>
              <p>All in all, Sembawang has joined Yishun and Bukit Panjang in becoming a pain in the ass for Woodlands residents suffering longer journey times. I can't wait for the throughfare system to be implemented. That would make 168&gt;858 a much more appealing option.</p>
              <p>And oh, for the record, I stay in Woodlands. And I take 858 at least six times a week. During peak hours :)</p>

              <p>For 858, there is no choice as it was initially a Woodlands to Yishun route. Taking it away from Yishun when TIBS extended it to airport will mean more complaints from Yishun commuters. Anyway, it really benefited both Woodlands and Yishun commuters to the airport all these years and the healthy loads benefitted TIBS to sustain the service.</p>
              <p>For 965, if it was to served Woodlands only to Sengkang, most likely it will be withdrawn within 6 months because of very poor load issues. Extended to Yishun was a wise choice by TIBS back then.</p>
              <p>For 966 and 969, don't want to comment much since they are poorly managed now.</p>
              <p>Another extension which I feel is a bit too much is service 28 to Tampines East. It would be better that SBST extends 292 to Tampines East and make it an Intra Town service.</p>

              <p>All in all, Sembawang has joined Yishun and Bukit Panjang in
              becoming a pain in the ass for Woodlands residents suffering longer
              journey times. I can't wait for the throughfare system to be
              implemented. That would make 168&gt;858 a much more appealing
              option.</p>
              <p>And oh, for the record, I stay in Woodlands. And I take 858 at
              least six times a week. During peak hours :)</p>

              <p>Blame it on the road designs if you want to. All these towns are somehow linked and to get to the West or East you have to pass through them.</p>
              <p>You can do your transfers if it appeal to you. Not everyone fancy transfers to transfers when you have probably a high chance of not being able to board the bus.</p>
              <p>If that's your mentality, the only way now is to find alternative transport, or utilize private transport.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why are there people so appalled with the amendment when it will most probably add less than 10 mins. For the record, even service 859 takes less than 20 mins to reach Chong Pang, given the loads and the huge loop it makes inside Sembawang. What makes you people think the amendment will add a crazy amount of timing to it?</p>

              <p>Taking 858 direct would definitely be cheaper. The whole express sector from Changi Airport to Khatib is already around 29.5 fare stages, ezlink would be $1.60.</p>
              <p>MRT from Khatib to Woodlands is $1.20. A total of $2.80, with rebate is $2.30, when I can save 70 cents if I take 858 straight.</p>
              <p>If you are saying 168 &gt; 858, it would be a total of $1.31 + $1.41. It is 10 cents cheaper than taking MRT &gt; 858.</p>
              <p>Direct trip may not be comfortable, it may be long. But saving 60 - 70 cents per trip is a lot.</p>

              <p>I would like to point out, there's another reason why it was amended to pass thru Sembawang. If u study the services in yishun, woodlands and sembawang properly, there is no direct link between khatib and sembawang (with the exception of the trains).</p>
              <p>This would probably be another main reason why one of the direct-to-east-routes was amended to pass thru sembawang. Why it chosen 858 i have no idea, but it is definitely a good amendment.</p>
              <p>If u ever tried to go from sembawang to khatib (and vice versa), it can take up to 40 mins depending on which part of sembawang and khatib u planning to go because of the stupid waiting time for transfers.</p>

              <p>Which is why I hope the throughfare system will be implemented soonest possible.</p>
              <p>The 858 amendment is a double whammy. It lengthens journey time, and it increases fares for the sizeable WDL-YIS commuter pool. Unlike the amendment for service 966 into Bukit Panjang, there is no mention this time round that commuters will be spared the additional fare stages that come together with Sembawang and KTP.</p>
              <p>In other words, a regular 858 Woodlands commuter travelling to say, Khatib, will be absorbing the cost of the increased fare stages, and that can lead to a one fare band increase. Multiply that daily increase and it comes to a substantial increase in travel cost.</p>
              <p>Fares aside, yes, I can blame the road designs. But from the typical commuter's point of view, if 161 and 168 can make it happen, (and so did the old 966) in making journeys more direct from the north, then it can happen. Winding bus routes are not everyone's cup of tea. But of course Sembawang residents will be happy because they will enjoy shorter travel time, yes, please, go enjoy to your heart's content. Cos after all, they aren't the ones affected in any way. They don't feel the pinch.</p>
              <p>By all means, improve the bus service network in Sembawang town even further. I've never discouraged that. I fully support the rationale behind such an amendment. But let's not do it at the cost of making public transport less attractive to current commuters.</p>
              <p>My issue has been why the 965 wasn't chosen, considering its more straightforward route and the greater benefits it will bring such as still being able to keep within one hour end-to-end. Because in this amendment, it's all about improving the intertown links for the north. 858's link to Changi Airport is just a bonus. Had there been other public transport alternatives at a reasonable fare, 858's amendment would not be an issue.</p>

              <p>Hah... I didn't even notice the speed of those OC500LE buses closely. I thought the speed of those buses are almost the same as those SBS Transit Scania K230UB buses. How about the newly launched Citaro buses then? I know that this kind of bus is currently on trial now. But what if SMRT decided to buy more of these Citaro buses then? Would they deploy some of these buses on 858 then?</p>
              <p>But seriously speaking, I think that 858 really need some of the WAB buses, since Changi Airport is now being rated the world's best Airport based on Skytrax Airport Awards recently, so as to compete with those SBS WAB buses 24, 27, 34, 36 and 53, to give convenience to those handicapped passengers who decided to take bus 858 to travel from the north of Singapore to Changi Airport or vise versa, and to give a better impression to tourists on SMRT buses.</p>
