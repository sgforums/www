CSS sv. 602 did not terminate inside Buona Vista Terminal. Its terminal was along Holland Dr, opp the swimming complex. But sometime in the late 90s, the terminal was closed and sv. 602 started its route from Shenton Way Terminal and looped at Holland Dr. Route was as follows:-<br><br>602     Shenton Way - Holland Dr (Loop)<br><br>via Palmer Rd, Anson Rd, Cecil St, Fullerton Rd, Stamford Rd, Orchard Rd, Penang Rd, Somerset Rd, Orchard Link, Orchard Blvd, Grange Rd, Napier Rd, Holland Rd, Queensway, C'wealth Ave, Holland Dr (loop)<br><br>and return via C'wealth Ave, Queensway, Holland Rd, Napier Rd, Tanglin Rd, Orchard Rd, Bras Basah Rd, Connaught Dr, Collyer Quay, Raffles Quay, Shenton Way<br><br></div>
