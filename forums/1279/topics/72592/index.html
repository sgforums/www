Lots of vehicles have to travel on the roads slowly and therefore a jam would come in. If you have look through the TIBS Svc Guide that is put on the racks of the buses, it's clearly stated that "Adverse Traffic and Weather Conditions, and even passenger activities may affect the frequency of the service and journey time." This does apply to SBST bus services as well. Therefore, don't grumble if buses come in at a higher frequency. I've ever waited Sv 105 for 1 hour and 15 mins during a day, whereby there was adverse traffic and weather condition.</div>

However it is possible that there is no alternative services.<br><br>Perhaps it's time for PTC to fulfil their role, to establish a communication systems between bus captains and HQ officer. The bus captains may update of road conditions and bus  load via walkie talkie to their HQ officer. The HQ officer may then relay the information to other bus captains.<br><br>For instance, bus captain of CSS608 if have a walkie talkie may receive information from HQ, and inform commuters at busstops of adverse road conditions which may affect TIBS61...<br><br>GPS???

Singaporeans are so typical that they love to follow instructions STRICTLY. So strictly that there's no room for flexibility.

Geylang/Paya Lebar/Telok Kurau/Tanjong Katong areas were the worst hit on Thursday, worst flooding in 36 years. Too bad I don't have a scanner. If not, I can show the picture where the Habit bus was pushed by 10 students from a nearby school when the bus was stuck at Jalan Turi.<br><br>Many other services were affected by the floods, not just Service 61.

However that's not true!!!<br><br>In Austin, all public buses have bus arrival time stated in all bus stops! Though most buses have an average of frequency of 30 minutes, they are very punctual (+/- 2 minute).<br><br>What's more, a monthly pass of USD15, allows you unlimited rides in all buses!!! And all buses have 2 bicycle racks at the front and back of buses, for commuters to ride with their bicycles.<br><br>Moreover, when buses are packed halfway through, the bus captains will radio their HQ, and HQ will dispatch another empty bus to continue the former route! I am really impressed.<br><br>Of course I have to admit, in Austin their sales tax is 7%. And 0.5% (if I remember correctly), are used to subsidise bus companies.<br><br>In Singapore, though SBST200 had stated bus arrival time in all bus stops, the bus arrival time may still be irregular (+/- 10 minutes).<br><br>It's irresponsible to say that the American waited up to an hour for buses. At least it's not true for Texas, Austin. If you work for bus companies, do spend a study trip in Austin!</div>
