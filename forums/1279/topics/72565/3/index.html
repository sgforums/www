I believe SBST will phase them out batch by batch, with the CAC Mercs the last to be phased off.<br><br>With more upcoming train lines, this will spell amendments and withdrawals of services, hence, SBST may not need 700 replacements buses. The number could be lower.</div>

Expect to see displacement reaction, ie new buses will be introduced at one depot, the not-so-new-ones will be transferred to those depots with O405s, most likely.</div>
