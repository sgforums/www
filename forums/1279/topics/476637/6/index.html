              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, I am not the prata man la. Why say until like this? I went past Loyang depot on my way to work every weekday. So I happened to see the incident that 10 buses were parked in one section of the depot on 1 morning. Okay I admit I use the wrong 'English words' at that time. As day goes by, there is nothing at that side and the other side is still on-going construction heavily. So no need to worry about any flipping here and there. I went past the depot today again and shall bypass it again and again. If you want any latest updates, I can update for you. Cheers.</p>
