              <p>Yeah, 6180A did 354 on Wed as debut Citaro for 354. Then Friday it did 354 also, &amp; Saturday (31Mar) also on 354.

              <p>8416H did 39 as you said twice last week IIRC, 81 on one day. Not sure about the other days. Think they are testing out feasibility for Citaros on 354, cause after all 354's main demand is during the crush loading on weekends. If there's still Citaro after Monday, then probably something is fishy.</p>

              <p>So? The reason you used for the Citaros being perm are more often than not linked to them having more power, which is definitely not the reason why 354 got 6180A.</p>

              <p>Alright thanks for the update!Â <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png">Â Anyway 6166S is on 518 today, finally appeared again after MIA for some time.<br><br>And for those who doubt 6180A is perm 354 like I've posted, 6180A is still on 354 today replacing 8416H's timings as in the past week. So any doubts that its not perm should be quashed by now. While 8419A continues to go MIA for the 5th straight day, except that its replacement is never fixed (today 8353E replaces 8419A).<br><br>BC of 6180A today seems quite happy he is driving a Citaro instead though. More like the feeling of driving a new bus rather than using the power (in case that SMRT MAN user comes quote my post again and proclaim his love for the Citaro's power).Â <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
