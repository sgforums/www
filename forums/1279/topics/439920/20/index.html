              <p>Somehow I still dun understand why u still want to keep a big
              fuss over this matter. If others want to post, just let them post.
              U can choose not to interfere that's all. It is CNY season now and
              I am sure that no one here wishes to argue all this just
              because of small matters. Since user id SMB128B already mentioned
              he will keep his cool here, so be it.</p>
              <p>Also dun forget that there are quite a number of service 163
              fans in here sgforums, including myself. So dun be surprised if
              different users here keep mentioning 163 here and there. In
              fact I know some of us here would also like to see more new buses
              or DDs deployed on 163 in future.</p>

              <p>i so freaking agree with you. These kids really need to learn to shut the fuck up. 163 is just a service. In fact, i find it damn boring. When time comes, the service will get new buses. these kids don't know how to treasure the older buses one. and i love the fact that it's not WAB. </p>

              <p>Chill man. I'm a 163 fan myself and I do hope that you'll respect those who want and hope for better buses for their favourite bus services. Yes, some of the forumers might have gone overboard in their excitement but seriously, it's just excitement over new buses lah. I myself is perfectly alright with the current fleet but I do hope for citaros on this service. </p>
              <p>In any way, just dont be too bothered with people who express their excitement over buses in this thread. I understand how you guys are feeling, it's like as if every single new bus must be deployed on this service then people are happy right? But I seriously think that's not the case. Perhaps it's the way they phrase their excitment and all. So dont take it too hard. </p>
              <p>Hope you understand. :)</p>

              <p>Chill man. I'm a 163 fan myself and I do hope that you'll
                  respect those who want and hope for better buses for their
                  favourite bus services. Yes, some of the forumers might have gone
                  overboard in their excitement but seriously, it's just excitement
                  over new buses lah. I myself is perfectly alright with the current
                  fleet but I do hope for citaros on this service. </p>
              <p>In any way, just dont be too bothered with people who express
                  their excitement over buses in this thread. I understand how you
                  guys are feeling, it's like as if every single new bus must be
                  deployed on this service then people are happy right? But I
                  seriously think that's not the case. Perhaps it's the way they
                  phrase their excitment and all. So dont take it too hard. </p>
              <p>Hope you understand. :)</p>
              <p>Cheers! </p>

              <p>Different people have different points of view over buses. Some like new buses, some like old buses. And I believe there are also some users here whom fancy old buses and can't bear to see them go (eg. Merczrox, SBS494J, bus555 etc).</p>
              <p>I personally it is best for all of us to keep all our personal thoughts to ourselves whether u like old or new buses. I agree with user TIB783G, suggest individuals discuss over PM instead of venting frustrations over here and creating more unnecessary flame wars just over a bus service. They are some users here whom went too overboard, but what to do? Just let the moderators handle the situation instead of posting all those sarcastic remarks over here, who knows, u might have unknowingly stepped onto other people's tail down here...</p>
              <p>Accept the fact that regardless we all like old buses or not, they will have to go one day and replaced by newer buses. Even the new buses now (K230UBs, OC500LEs, Wrights, Citaros, MAN A22s), these buses will get older as the years pass by and they also have to go after 19 years. Too bad that this is Singapore government's law. Unlike other neighboring countries that have 30 year old buses and vehicles still running on the roads.</p>

                  <p>Let me remind u one more time, if u want to stop creating a flame war, u as your part please stop posting all these craps too. If others like SMB128B and SBS6078M want to post, let them post. If they shoot u back, then is your own problem. Think twice, what have u done in order for them to shoot u? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And I have nothing to do over this matter</span>.</p>
                  <p>Btw also please stop calling others kids anymore, including myself. just to let u know, I am in my 30s this year and i am already married. I dun know how old users SMB128B and SBS6078M are. To me u are still a kid, based on the way u post. If I am rite u are still below 21 right? So please think of yourself first before u call others "kids".</p>
                  <p>And lastly, please also show some respect over each and every bus fans down here. If they like new buses on service 163, so be it. If u like the old buses so much especially the MK3s, go and make use of the time now to enjoy the rides before they are gone.</p>

              <p>Guys, I really dunno why there's a need to fight on this trivia matters, but before you start pointing your finger saying his/her parents never teach him/her properly, bear in mind that the other 3 fingers are pointing at yourself.</p>
              <p>Merczrox, true enough that I just need to google your nick and your intro on yourself back in 2008 was shown clearly on my screen, so SBS6078M would have even google it and found your real name, so dun blame others for your own carelessness as you yourself are the one whom posted your real name earlier.</p>
              <p>I'm not helping anyone here, but just hope that my post can extinguish the flame and drain away this ugly scene. Be it you are 18 years old or 30 years old, there are still bus fans younger than you, watching this great movie directed by you guys involved. Guys, Jackie Chan and Jet Li no more making CNY movies, so stop all the fighting scenes.</p>
              <p>Chill man.</p>
              <p>2 cents worth.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
