              <p>IMO , I think SBST maintains their citaros better than SMRT (not
              saying SMRT citaros are horrible , both are good , just that I
              think SBST citaros are more comfy to ride on.)</p>
              <p>Hence , I feel that SBST should get some more citaros , but no ,
              not too many of them either. Perhaps another 100 more citaros would
              suffice. SBST could also consider buying some single decks from
              Volvo. Though , SBST really needs a more powerful single deck bus
              to deploy on services such as Service 36 so that the engine does
              not overheat easily.</p>
              <p>[Its best if SBST don't assemble the bodyworks themselves(CDGE),
              because honestly their assembling kinda suck , unlike EvoBusGMH.
              (Wrights are an exception because wrightbus UK is (Y) :P)</p>
              <p>On the other hand , I feel SMRT shouldn't stick on to MAN buses
              , but instead try some other companies (Not Merc or MAN). The A22s
              are starting to get creaky body , most probably due to Gemilang
              Bodywork . In addition , there are already 200 of them , which
              occupies rather a large portion of SMRT bus fleets. However , I am
              also fine if SMRT continues to buy A22s , just with a differnet
              bodywork. For bendies wise , both Citaro G and the MAN bendy I am
              interested in them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>[PS. The above post is purely my opinion , it is not meant to be
              accurate or flame.]</p>

              <p>SBS has been assembling buses since the 70s and 80s and I find most of the buses ok. But some bodyworks like Gemilang, I have to agree on the quality issues. Maybe the KUBs should have used Wright or Volgren.</p>
              <p>As for SMRT, maybe they can get the Scania N series, not sure if it is fully low floor.

              <p>I'm not trying to shoot you down &amp; I have no intention to (I'm going to try to put it to you in a nicer manner than 'SBS6078M' in case you shoot him too), but the reason why 36 is making do with its fleet of KUBs (majority Euro Vs somemore) is because the crowds along certain sectors of its route is really really heavy. The Suntec-Orchard area is one, the Marine Parade that area also. <br><br>If 36 gets Citaros, yes it will be faster and less lethargic on the expressway stretches. But the time made up on the expressway sectors would be lost once you hit those bus stops with such heavy pax traffic. The KUBs are just faster in loading everyone onboard to be honest due to its wider aisle and larger standing area below the steps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"><br><br>The higher roof of the KUBs also makes it easier for the BC to see if there's any alighting pax who is trying to get out but stuck in the bus. I've encountered many BCs driving the Citaros which are packed who either: 1) Missed the stop where pax already pressed the bell long ago (no 'Stopping' warning light on dashboard for Citaros, KUBs have), or 2) stuck at the bus stop for twice the time needed in a KUB because everyone's head is blocking the BC's view of seeing who exactly haven't alighted. And yes, that is with CCTVs fitted at the same positions as the KUBs on the Citaros. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/omg.png" alt="omg.png"><br><br>And if I'm not wrong (I'm not too sure about this), but the KUBs are more suitable for 36 too because 36's rest time at CGA (that is its only terminating point) is slightly shorter than the other airport services with Citaros (24 at AMK, 53 at Bishan). Not to mention the jumpbus system of 36, the BC of the previous 36 bus usually jumps straight onto the next 36 bus that arrives around 5-10mins later to take over &amp; drive straight away, rest for the BC yes but no rest for the bus practically. You probably won't feel it from inside or outside the buses accurately, but the Citaros actually run hotter than the KUBs. That's why if you put Citaros on 36, they might tend to overheat faster? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Either peak or non-peak, that slot should be a HG slot. The 2 BN A/P slots are usually one after another during peak. The S shift one for BN is in between somewhere the HG Citaros.</p>
