              <p>Fyi, BNDEP hasn't updated most of their buses' perm stickers for months already. Even those found VO3xs which have been redeployed for months still show the perm sticker of their previous services. So the perm sticker thing is not accurate for BNDEP services for now. Other depots, yes it is accurate.</p>

              <p>Yeah. And to user 'SBS128B', you want to say something like 6058X is running around, make sure your cameo for that bus is reported first in this forum? I looked through all the posts for the past few weeks, no one mentioned 6058X on cameo at all in Sgf. I asked you to show me the evidence, your reply was not answering my question at all. Where's the services 6058X has done? At least there's more than one guy (other than me) which saw 8333M running around on various services (12, 28, 291). Probably (i say probably) you are right that 6058X is out, but right now, i only see 1 replacement bus and not 2 on BN 109 daily and that is 6116L.Â </p>

              <p>Can i ask, above the windscreen as in where?

              <p>And for HG Citaros, those from the 6065A, 6067U, 6068S batch i spotted, the perm stickers are on the coinbox (the side facing the driver). Very difficult to spot, unless you just happen to be crossing the road/standing facing the offside of the bus. For the 6090B batch that recently went in 83 (iirc) and 6096K, the perm stix is towards the right of the steering wheel on the dashboard itself. Not sure about the rest just yet.</p>
              <p>AM 53 Citaros some have perm stickers also on the coinbox (6012C, 6035L, 6038D for eg. iirc), some like 6015U &amp; 6016S have the perm stix elsewhere (think on the dashboard too) or probably none at all (couldn't find). Not sure abt 6077R &amp; 6081C and the rest of the AMDEP Citaros though.</p>
              <p>But don't try to be so obvious and stick your head here and there to find the perm sticker yeah. I don't want to be labelled by others as teaching others new ways to disturb the BC from driving properly.Â <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>in what ways are the Hispano bodywork crap? Yes some of 965 O405s were previously JB-regged and they look unappealing cos of the fading paint and stuff... So? They are solid, strong and durable. Look at TIB582U. 2 (or 3) major accidents already, and today its operating like a dream. They hardly give ride comfort that Osim would be proud of. Ur better off cherishing them rather than being disgusted of them. I know of people being disgusted at Citaros even, but none of them thumbs-downed the sturdy O405.Â </p>

              <p>Oh yes and juz to continue from previous topic:</p>
              <p>WELL, I would like the hispanos... TO BE FAR AND AWAY! Who cares if it's sturdy and hard? it's not a comfort to ride on anyway. unlike the volgrens. just my bus. so sad it got turned away... TIB582U is noisy and loud, so OPERATING LIKE A DREAM?! and i bet volgrens are just as sturdy.</p>
              <p>AND if u dunno that sengkang keeps getting downgrades and hardly upgrades, then u had better stfu and stop being such a kaypoh by treating every place of singapore as your fairyland. u had better things to do, u noe, ah boy.</p>

              <p>I know where it appears on the BNDEP KUBs, below the bus stopping sign usually. But the bus stopping sign for Citaros is not visible from the driver position? I mean, it is actually further back than the rego plate area and not clustured together with the interior rego plate (you should get what i mean). So the perm sticker is still there uh for those BNDEP Citaros with stix?Â </p>

              <p>Anyway, not sure if anyone has raised this before, but I think unlike the Mk4s and K230UBs, the Citaros do not have a sign that lights up on the dashboard when someone presses the door stopping bell? It caused quite a number of BCs to miss their stops during peak hours because they had forgotten about the people intending to alight (made worse by the fact they can't see the bus stopping sign at all from their driving position in the Citaro)</p>
              <p>The Volvos (iirc it should be Mk4s and even VOs too since they share the same dashboard?) have a box in the dashboard that lights up in orange with the 'S' sign when someone presses the door stopping bell. A similar kind is present on the dashboard for KUBs. But i don't think the Citaros have it. Correct me if i'm wrong!</p>
