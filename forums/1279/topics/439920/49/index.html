              I find the Citaros for SBST are still good and comfortable and certainly more powerful and better maintained. Air con have seen improvements.
              And they are much better than the SMRT ones, which are so poorly maintained.

              BCs only floor acceleration when they are late or trying to overtake, not for fun.
              
              And these kids think it is so fun to floor the accelerator to have that shiok feeling, especially those SMRT fan boys. SMRT BCs normally have to floor acceleration of the buses because they have seriously poor schedule planning, not enough buses and the poor BCs have to floor the acceleration in order not to be late and penalised, at the risk and anger of other road users and its commuters.

              You can't compare old buses and new buses anymore. The era of new vehicles is to save cost. using more plastic parts, individual bucket seats, etc. 
              Of course I will prefer SBS's old thick cushion seats than the Vogelstize individual bucket seats. But the era has changed, which has changed for me once since I was young where those more interesting old NAC buses like Volvo B57s, Mercedes Benz OF1413s, Albion Vikings, Leyland Atlanteans have to make way to more standardised air con fleets. 
              When the Citaro was introduced by Daimler Benz in 1997, I always hoped that SBS will bring in a demo or a fleet for such a prestigious bus on our roads. Too bad it didn't materialised. But nevertheless after 15 years of wait, finally the wish come true again with SBST buying 300 of them. Though they may not be the best buses as of now, but I believe SBST will continue to improve them as time pass. Appreciate what we can see on our roads now, because time pass and we may not see them again, especially what is happening to the Volvo MKIIIs and Leyland Olympians.

              Normally SBST BCs drive fast is because they are behind schedule or they are driving the last bus when they want to return bus to depot asap.  You said it was a decade ago. Now bus schedules have improved. I doubt he can drive that fast with the schedule.
              However there are also a few exceptional cases, I once took a Volvo B10M MK4 DM on service 62 in the late 90s, which I think it travel around 80km/h! 
              And service 138 which can be incredibly fast along some roads in Mandai, be it the old O405s or the new Citaros.
