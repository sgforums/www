              <p>Has something to do with acceleration between the Citaros &amp; KUBs from what I can tell. For example, for the set of bus stops along Pasir Ris, it might take up till 2 mins to get from one stop to another in a KUB with full acceleration. But in a Citaro under full acceleration, the time taken is usually about 30s or 45s lesser on average. This is what I observed because I take 53 at the same timing every weekday in the morning and more than twice weekly the same BC would be driving the slot, just that his bus alternates between 6035L/6036J and same random SP KUB. The traffic conditions at that peak hour time is usually similar too.</p>
              <p>The KUBs (more so the Euro Vs) have a more sluggish gearbox if you could call it. The BCs can floor the Euro IV KUBs in almost the same manner as you would in a Citaro, but do the same in a Euro V and the gearbox will just simply refuse to shift up, then cause the whole bus to have a big jerk and losing speed before it finally upshifts.</p>
              <p>Probably that's why there's like more Euro V KUBs as SPs then the Euro IVs in recent months, those Euro Vs are definitely not kicked out by having a higher mileage than the Euro IVs in any case.</p>

              to another in a KUB with full acceleration. But in a Citaro under
              full acceleration, the time taken is usually about 30s or 45s
              lesser on average. This is what I observed because I take 53 at the
              same timing every weekday in the morning and more than twice weekly
              the same BC would be driving the slot, just that his bus alternates
              between 6035L/6036J and same random SP KUB. The traffic conditions
              at that peak hour time is usually similar too.</p>
              <p>The KUBs (more so the Euro Vs) have a more sluggish gearbox if
              you could call it. The BCs can floor the Euro IV KUBs in almost the

              and the gearbox will just simply refuse to shift up, then cause the
              whole bus to have a big jerk and losing speed before it finally
              upshifts.</p>
              <p>Probably that's why there's like more Euro V KUBs as SPs then
              the Euro IVs in recent months, those Euro Vs are definitely not
              kicked out by having a higher mileage than the Euro IVs in any

              <p>Seriously, there's no reason to floor accelerator each n every time, engine will wear off in the long run...</p>
              <p>in fact, contary to what people believe, if you keep on 'drag' your gear, the gear will tend not to change at all. It's like why MT vehicles you've to apply cluch and let go of accelerator to change gear.</p>
