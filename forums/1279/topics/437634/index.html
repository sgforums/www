              <p>I love taking buses and now I missed it coz of my new job, there are no straight bus to my workplace</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I just want to know how irritate are you with bus service 171? The one from yishun Interchange to Marina and back? I dun mind the weekdays (well I kinda have a problem but that will tell that later) but Saturdays annoy the crap out of me. </p>
              <p>I dreaded working on Saturday before not because of unable to enjoy my Saturday but most of waiting time will be wasted on the bus. Once a while, I dun mind but if it's so frequent, they should do something. Frequency every 30 mins or more. And when the bus came, it pack. I have complained to them, I even heard some commuters called up and complained but nothing happen.</p>
              <p>A reply I got from them was because there was huge traffic at the city. ok I accepted that but for a while. Once at night going home from work. I took bus 969 from Tampines (where I once work) and stopped at bus stop just after the MRT. I had to take 171 there to go to the west. It's the first bus-stop after the interchange. 5 969 buses passed by, not a single 171 came. And when it came 30 mins later, it pack! I made another complain, ask them what excuse can they give since it was not from town. They said oh the bus was following the frequency time. Goodness, it was only 8pm, people are still going home. If it's 10 or 11, I can let go. </p>
              <p>Now I thought things might change after numerous complains, I tried taking the bus again to head to Yishun, sigh... some things never change. </p>

              <p>Might as well replace the rigids with A380s.</p>
              <p>The fleet of 171 has stayed where it is for such a long time for good reasons. Has anyone analysed the catchment of 171? Is there consistent high ridership throughout the whole journey? Why is it that both 190 reach BPJ from SMU and yet you have more people taking 190? Because 171 was never meant to be a MRC to YIS direct. If I may dare say, when the MRT comes up alomg the Bukit Timah corridor, this will be the first to go alongside 927: 171 will detour into zoo from YIS and eventually terminate at BPJ or CCK.</p>
