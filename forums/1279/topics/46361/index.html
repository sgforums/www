            <div class='col-md body'>Hi forumers,<br><br>I pity the svc 175 drivers. When they are at Lim Chu Kang, they would be the only one at the terminal (I <strong>won't</strong> call that place a terminal). At the other end of the route, Gombak Drive, the bus would loop there. The only chance to interact with other drivers would be at Choa Chu Kang Int, where they would stop for a short time or occasionally, with passengers.<br><br>Do you think so? Give your thoughts and comments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's right. Poor Svc 175 drivers. Somehow the LCK Terminal doesn't have any facilities for the drivers to rest or what. The only thing that they could do is to either rest in the bus, or to come out and 'take a fresh breathe of air'.</div>

There's only ONCE when I had a freezing ride in TIB 1014 L. After that, TIB 1014 L is REALLY warm, much warmer than any other Lance 211. Even though the aircon can be felt in the front during boarding, the aircon practically can't be felt when you sit down, regardless of location. I really hope Tibs can deploy these buses to feeder services, as long journey in Lance 211 can really be unbearable.<br><br>I agree with you.
