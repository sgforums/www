It is due to the valve body design. I have also enclosed a picture of it. With a massive fleet, the difference in maintenance cost will be very visible. This is undisputed and you have no case against this fact.<br><br>Having a powerful first gear at about gear ratio of 6, helps to move the vehicle more effectively especially when with load. Because the bus travels with passenger load most of the time.<br><br>I have previously said that ZF has a flater gear ratio. But it does not offer the kind of boost required for ferrying the mass of the people. Even though the 2nd gear of the Voith gearbox is looks weak. But think back on practical means. With a weaker first gear ratio, the driver will have to accelerate more in order to achieve the correct speed to activate the solenoid to start to shift to 2nd gear. Voith on the other hand has a shorter first gear which 2nd gear kicks in quicker than ZF. The momentum of the vehicle has already reach the optimum and thus cruising off is no issue at all. Therefore if 2 same engines are used. Before the ZF can catch up at the 2nd gear, the Voith has already moved off and the 2nd gear with a lower gear ratio number meaning as you can understand higher speed, ZF will have to accelerate more to catch up. Not talking about the load yet.<br><br>In order for you to understand, you need to use a ZF mobidig and Voith gearbox tester, plug into the ECU of the bus and get someone to drive normally while you monitor the gear changes and brake stages then you will be able to understand. It is very hard for me to explain via words.<br><br>Statistically proven that ZF costs a lot more in maintaining the gearboxes as it breaks down more than the Voith. I'm sorry as the actual details are truely classified. I need to protect both the interests of my gearbox suppliers financially. Mainly due to the valve body design. The so called ZF ecomat transmission is unable to overcome the shortcoming of the valve body design to achieve the cost savings demands of the company. Voith on the other hand due to a superior design is able to. The valve body you see in BIH I'll post it here again.<br><br>http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n298/arakyo/valvebody.jpg<br><br>This valve body being the 2nd brain of the gearbox is the executor part while the ECU is the planner part. A very critical portion of the gearbox installed underneath the gearbox assy. It is totally submerged into hot ATF while operating. Hence exposed to the conditions in the gearbox. Notice that they are merely electrical items. How long do you think it can last against the valve body of the Voith transmission which is installed externally? Stats have already shown all these years.<br><br>If I do not have ground experience, then I will be thinking like you. I see that you learnt most of your knowledge via reading. Get into some real action and maintain a fleet. Understand the perspective with a macro view and start maintaining the gearbox both technically hands on and follow up statiscally. Then it will be beneficial to your knowledge. The textbook only helps to explain theoretically on the issue on their own point of view. Actual situation requires a hands on experience coupled with theory knowledge in order to find out the truth on which gearbox actually reaps in more savings and give enough power. Also you need to differentiate between lock up and torque converter clearly as they are totally different items which have different uses. Otherwise you're confusing the readers here.</div>

I know nuts, and ended up spouting nonsense here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But erh, you mentioned that Voith gearboxes lasts longer and ZF has a shorter lifespan. In ZF, this is compensated by having a longer engine lifespan. In short Voith has a longer lifespan, but the engine it is coupled to has a shorter lifespan. In ZF, it has a shorter lifespan, but engine lifespan is longer. Therefore which ever gearboxes u use, its going to be the same. Both requires major overhaul if something breaks down. In Voith, engine requires more overhauling. In ZF, gearbox requires more overhauling. Therefore, whether if its ZF or Voith, the maintainance cost is going to be about the same, unless engine overhauling is more expensive or vice versa, as said by MS, who said that ZFs cost more to operate.<br><br>Btw, MS, did the cost of maintaining of the gearboxes that u mentioned earlier on cover the cost of overhauling of the engines due to extensive wear? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

It's difficult for me to go into details if you do not understand the concept of how the gearbox works.<br><br>The ZF however despite costs also substantially being technically &amp; make inferior to Voith also proves statistically to lose out to Voith breaking down ratios &amp; the need to replace them is more in terms of percentage. And it is a lot more. Exact details I cannot reveal in the public forum.<br><br>When you say Voiths are poor hill climbers that's not true. ZF has a gear ratio of 3.43(1st), 2.01(2nd), 1.42(3rd), 1(4th, direct coupling), 4.84(Reverse) for 4HP. But Voith has a whoppping 6.1(1st), 1.43(2nd), 1(direct coupling), 5.2(reverse) for a 3 gear Voith 3N models 4 gear voiths have 6.1(1st), 1.43(2nd), 1.00(3rd, direct coupling), 0.73(4th), 5.2(reverse) for 4 gears Voith 3N models.<br><br>In terms of top speed, Voith are better. In terms of up hill, Voith has a powerful first gear twice the power of ZF. If you mount it into the same engine you will know the difference. Although ZF has a more flater ratio, It does not give kinda boost needed to move the capacity of passengers when needed compared to Voith.<br><br>Also those wheeoooorrrr sounds are not gearboxes. Because if gearboxes make those sounds then the gearbox must be in such a terrible condition that I have not even heard of before. NOrmally those constantly meshing sounds are from the axle or diff unit. BEcause in the gearboxes, gears are constantly meshed. Only the locking of different clutches decide which gear to use. Study the sun and planetary gear system. This will be the gearbox concept that's going to dominate the future market.<br><br>I am currently waiting for my car to be brought into SGP from France by Sime Darby Autofrance awaiting the launch of the Peugeot 207. The gearbox itself is tiptronic. Very hardly will you find the traditional manual meshing gearbox unless it's a very basic model. In buses however, I don't think it is financially sensible to manufacture buses with manual gearboxes anymore. Because unlikely it can sell well anymore.<br><br>The BC I meet do not have any preferences to which gearbox. As long as can be driven easily, don't breakdown, hopefully got air con. OK already.<br><br>And Yes!! MB0405 is legendary. Easy to maintain and more BC prefer MB0405. Easy to drive too. I have asked so many BC before when they are at my workshop while I give them a bus to cameo, like the most recent, one BL shuttle service BC need to take bus from me during a weekend, I asked him Volvo MK4 or MB0405. And guess his choice?<br><br>100% of them prefers MB0405.</div></blockquote>I asked a BC for fave bus and he pointed to the MKIII and an 0405.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for breakdowns, I've come across many occasions of stuck ZFs, but 1 Voith (9844Z) to date.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 noticeable feature of the voith gearbox is that it tends to hold the 1st gear much longer than the other 2 or 3 geard. Can be inferred that the ratio of the 1st gear is significantly higher than the ZF counterpart.<br><br>When the gearboxes wear out, for voith, there will be very noticeable stickiness in shifting down gears and in some cases, the shifting up will have a noticeable lag time. For ageing ZFs, there will also be higher lag times in between gear switches and very noticeably, the lock-up clutch does not kick in if the bus is accelerating fast. If it does when the bus is accelerating slower, then instead of the characteristical kick, you get teeth grinding sounds instead.</div>
