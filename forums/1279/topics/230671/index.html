            <div class='col-md body'>(1) CNG need to pump gas at Jurong Island. Only the split Shift people are arranged to pump the gas. So only services with split shift services can possibly accomodate a CNG. Only SL has CNG. Obvious reasons. SL is nearest to Jurong Island.<br><br>(2) Not everyone can drive a CNG bus. Only those trained are able to do so.<br><br>(3) CNG bus basically has the same anatomy as other buses. Except that the means of carburetion is different. It is by means of gas instead of liquid fuel.<br><br>(4) There are 8 gas tanks on top of the CNG bus in the SBST buses. Each tank can store up to a maximum of 200bar which is 200 x 10 to the power of 5Pa.<br>Diesel is measured in Litres while CNg is measured by Bar. For better illustration, the atmospheric pressure on Earth is approx 1bar. The brake booster spring if dislodged from the booster can kill people and lodge itself up into the ceiling of an air-craft hangar. This is the amount of spring power it has. And it takes 6 bar to compressed it. imagine 33 times more of such power compressed inside the tank.<br><br>(5) I feel that CNG bus sux operationally due to refuelling/carburetion process. If I have a choice I hope that these buses never existed in SBST.<br><br>(6) CNG buses scores very well for emission. Giving us no headache on emission tests.<br><br>(7)Why it stalls during e-brake. It's applicable to any combustion engine just that it's more prominent in the CNG bus. Because when the vehicle is moving at speed, the curburetion is consistant. Air and fuel mixture is optimum to keep the engine moving. But when you suddenly jam brake, you're forcing your engine to suddenly slow down from high RPM. In a manual vehicle, if you dun clutch in quick enough, the vehicle confirm stall. In auto, if the gear dun release the clutch to N the engine also stalls. But the bus will still maintain in 1st gear. So the carburetion must adjust to suit the situation mechanically to give in ample fuel when the BC lifts his foot off the accelerator to the brake. Thats why sometimes it stalls. You drive any other car it's the same. This is the problem of the TPS (throttle positioning sensor)<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> And also by the way, Volvo, Leyland sux.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nadi Putra</strong><br><br>The Daewoo CNG buses (most of the time) that run on a particular service will have a livery with the matching line (laluan) colour and seat scheme. The new buses were commissioned in batches since last June.<br><br>Services running are Laluan 100, 200, 300, 301, 302 and 400. Fares are 50 sen per ride and services run at 30 mins interval during off-peak and 20 mins interval during peak hours.<br><br>The services go to different parts inside Putrajaya, including residential precincts. All services (except Laluan 301) goes to the roundabout known as "Parcel ABCDE", which is the ring road serving all 5 parcels of land comprising the various "smaller" ministries, each parcel with its own colour scheme. So don't be alarmed if it seemed like it's going one big round if u're going to Putrajaya Sentral or Alamanda, which are the usual next destinations.<br><br>The only 2 bus terminals in Putrajaya are Putrajaya Sentral (ERL and inter-state) and Terminal Bas Presint 1 (local).<br><br>RapidKL only has limited participation here with 2 services (426 and 427) running inside Putrajaya, using Dongfeng buses. Fares are $1 but you get a day pass that entitles you to ride all local shuttles (green in colour). But at Putrajaya Sentral, E1 goes to KL Sentral while T43 connects you to Kelana Jaya LRT and Damansara (where The Curve, IKEA and Cineleisure is).

Super good suspension, no or little rattling, unlike Volvo B7RLEs, which rattles like a rattelsnake. Scania cannot say, cause old bus and technology, O405 quite old liao, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BUT STILL NO RATTLING MAN!</span>, pure german quality! Volvo B7RLEs are new yet already rattle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>And pls dont say ZF sux and Voith is the best. Both got good points and bad points, you said ZF suc maybe because you pointed out some "black horses", for example the LO3x, which suffered from prob in gear changing. Voiths i agree is the best, I love Voiths on the VO2x and Habits!!! They rock!!<br><br>But VO2x got BIG problem. If the bus was on a hill , the gearbox tends to refuse to downshift, all the way its top gear. And sometimes the BC didn't put in full trottle (sekali is already full trottle), all this makes VO2x worst hill climbers. Last time took one of it and the bus was so FREAKING FREAKING slow, like those ah ma ah pek got serious leg and back prob, walk super slow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>ZF is wastage of gears, but excellent in climbing hills, due to multiple speeds, but they SUCK in top speed , acceleration is the best. Gearboxx also sound very nice, the "wheeoooorrrr sound" Voith can hear the whistle sound only when stopping, which can be hard to hear when u are at a bus stop. If you lucky a Voith-ed bus stop near the bus stop, you can hear it. ZF very distinctive, can hear when the bus leaves the bus stop, without fail.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
