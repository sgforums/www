It is very obvious if the driver is accelerating lightly, there is the 1st gear, and then he releases the accelerator. The bus jerks (The ZF shifts).</div></blockquote>That is true. I agree that the gearbox changes gears according to acceleration also, with drags occuring for slow acceleration, and for impatient drivers. But assuming that the driver applies the same pressure on the accelerator for the same gearbox with different programmings, the behavior of the gear changes will differ also. Take for example the Leyland Olympian 3-Axle vs the Volvo counterpart, both are fairly similar buses with the same ZF4HP500 gearbox.<br><br>Applying the same pressure on both buses, the LO would change from 1st to 2nd fairly quickly and with less dragging. The VO would on the other hand drag its 1st gear slightly to increase its momentum before switching to 2nd at a significantly higher rpm.<br><br>There are of course reasons why the tuning differs for both types. The LO has a 'loose' 1st gear because it can deal with it. I've come across VOs with the same kind of tuning and the results can be horrible with vibrations as the bus loses momentum when the lock-up occurs too quickly, in certain cases, the lock-up kicks in another 2 times before the VO lumbers off into 2nd gear. An LO with a ZF tuned like the VO is more likely make passengers satisfied with the higher rate of increase in momentum, but such tuning is not so much required.<br><br>Hence, both acceleration and rpm factors in on the gearbox's behavior. Oh, and I'm no technician also, the above is just based on what I observe as a passenger. If the information I gave is confusing/misleading or utterly wrong, then I'm really sorry.</div>

The Voith makes it even slower in acceleration with its underpowered engine. Some people i talked to agree that they are better off with ZF.
