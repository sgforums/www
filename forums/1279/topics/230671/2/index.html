Basically what you're saying in the first part is all wrong.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Correction to your myth on gearbox</strong></span><br>The gearboxes are not designed to 'tend to refuse to downshift'. When the gearbox refuse to downshift, to us the technical personnel means that the gearbox solenoid is faulty or the gearbox clutch is unable to lock the correct gear when the input shaft decreases.<br><br>Statistically shows that only few cases involving Voiths compared to the loads of ZF with such problems. what you encountered is unfortunately a case by case one time experience. And not the entire macro situation. That is why I initially suggested to you that you should view things from a macro view. Like this you're reacting by jumping into info which is a great taboo in leadership. Only paparazzis or gossiping housewives use this way of making conclusions.<br><br>Even when the bus comes into the workshop no one is going to buy the story the BC says 'unable to change gear' totally. We still need to screen the case with the assistance of the ZF mobidig for ZF gearboxes and Voith gearbox tester for Voith. From there, we will know exactly which solenoid is not working. Also we need to check the ATF colour to determine whether the clutch inside are worn.<br><br>As you said when the bus with Voith gearbox cannot downshift then the ZF gearbox bus will be able to overtake it. It's true. But again you're looking at things from a stereotyped view. I have said: Voith have much lesser problems than ZF. If you're to look at statistics, you'll actually find Voith over taking ZF up the slope many more times than the ZF overtaking the Voith.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The use of a gearbox</strong></span><br>The gearbox do not generate it's own rotary power. It taps the rotary power from the engine. So the engine itself plays an important role to determine which bus is more powerful and faster. The gearbox merely capitalise on the limited effects of engine rotary power and convert it into a variety of speed via torque.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Voith is technically better than ZF because:</strong></span><br>(1) Voith are able to adjust the clutch back pressure to accomodate the wear of the clutch so as to maximise the use of the clutch which leads to longer lifespan. ZF is unable to.<br><br>(2) Voith gearbox solenoids are installed externally. ZF are installed internally which means it is exposed to the hot ATF running all over the solenoid &amp; harness valve body assembly. And if the seal at the harness is worn after some time, ATF can leak in and short the pins inside which causes the gearbox to engage clutches abnormally. so sometimes the BC can drive half way and suddenly the gearbox disengage gear for the BC. Or downshift for the BC. Worst case scenarios whereby the gearbox will attempt to engage reverse gear while on the move. But reverse gear can only be engage when the vehicle is stationery. So it will rather cause unwanted wear on the clutches. All these problems Voith do not have. When gears are unable to engage for Voith simply mean that the solenoid is damaged and a replacement can be done in a jiffy without getting hands dirty or scalded by the hot ATF like ZF.<br><br>(3) Voith spare parts are well made compared to ZF. The main cable of the gearbox which connects the gearbox to the ECU is a very critical component. The outer layer of the ZF cable is made up of cheap plastic braided coverings that are not waterproof. Voith is made up of solid insulation to fend against wear and heat.<br><br>There are many other points which will have to employ the use of pictures and some are sensitive info which I will not reveal.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Understanding of matters</strong></span><br>Of course you have the right to support the brand you like and I have to respect that. But I have to right the wrongs with proper facts and you need to admit that facts are still facts.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, just to share my knowledge.<br><br>Voith DIWA transmissions are designed very differently to ZF-Ecomat transmissions.  Especially of interest is the design of the torque converter.<br><br>The Voith transmission (at least on paper) seems to have a lower first gear ratio compared to the ZF (5.05:1 for a Voith D864.3), however, because of the design of the Voith torque converter, this is the ratio for the entire 1st gear because the Voith does not have seperate unlocked and lock-up stages.  In contrast, the first gear ratio given by ZF for their Ecomat transmissions is 3.43:1, but this ratio is achieved during the "lock-up" stage - in the hydraulic stage, that ratio is lowered to nearly 6:1, giving impressive initial transmission power.  This is why you will experience better initial acceleration with a ZF transmission.<br><br>In practice, buses with Voith transmissions generally have lower final drive ratios to compensate for the (lack of) acceleration.  ZF transmissions can use a slightly higher final drive ratio yet achieve the same acceleration as the Voith, while achieving the same top-end speed (comparing a Voith D864.3 and ZF 5HP 500).  The new 6-speed ZF transmissions give a whole new meaning to the word "flexibility" - 0.59:1 in 6th gear means that an extremely low final drive can be used, providing outstanding acceleration AND top speed while improving economy.  To prove my point, compare the performance betwen a Mercedes-Benz O 405 with a Voith and then a ZF.<br><br>And talking about economy, the ZF transmission has more intermediate gears, meaning that there is always a correct gear for each situation.  Compare that with the Voith that easily pushes engine revs on new buses to near 2000 rpm and you will be able to see a visible difference.

ZF allows better fuel efficiency and engine protection. Cause diesel engines actually weren't designed for high rpm working jobs( what i meant high rpm is reacher near the max engine rpm), which explains why ships and diesel generation uses lower rpm diesel engines. Maybe im wrong about this, i dont know, i dont wish to start a debate again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But dont worry about ZF faults. ZF is coming up with the new ZF Ecolife series. Hopefully the new gearbox doesn't have the solenoid design bugs. Yea, i stongly agree with what MS said, if solenoid A is spoilt, the bus can only move in reverse. This is extremely troublesome (imagine moving a DD in reverse down a 4 storey building like what MS has said. OPPS!

Remember about what dave said about engine protection, about engine being runned at high rpm near its max working range? If Voith makes engine overhauling more frequent due to more engine strains, now you have to cover more engine costs as well.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>@MS:</strong> A "lock-up" torque converter is in fact a hydraulic clutch that links the bus engine with the transmission input shaft.  Also, lower (higher number) final drive ratio gives more responsive acceleration but less top speed, and a higher (lower number) final drive ratio gives less responsive acceleration but more top speed.  Same applies for gear ratios for transmissions because both ratios are directly linked.<br><br>Alright, back to my specialty now, CNG-powered bus engines.  Singapore has only experimented with one type of CNG engine and that is the Volvo GH10B with open-loop lean-burn combustion and central gas injection via four injection valves.  Such a system provides adequate performance but suffers greatly if there is too much variation in fuel quality.  The latest CNG engines offer either closed-loop stoichiometric or closed-loop lean-burn combustion and provides resistance to such variations, and are also able to adjust the air/fuel mixture in real-time to allow for such things as temperature and pressure changes, ignition condition, and other manufacturing tolerances.  The new generation also provides signifcantly improved power and torque outputs as well as improved responsiveness.  The latest Volvo CNG engine is the G9A which features a maximum rating of 300 PS/1400 Nm, closed-loop stoichiometric combustion with exhaust gas recirculation and a three-way catalytic converter to meet Euro 5+/EEV emissions specifications.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</div>

ZF allows better fuel efficiency and engine protection.
