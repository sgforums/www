Why being a tortoise in a shell don't you? We will not cry when being reported to police. We did not break any rules. So what about all of you? Phototaking in interchange? If you are professional enough, jolly well get a nice photo outside interchange! Wrong sunlight, angle and break rule by taking photo in interchange? Doing 3 things wrong and you dare to speak up for yourself? Aren't you ashamed of your doings? If TIB1062Y act like a boss, you are acting like a no rank cleaner in tis forum.<br><br>And can i ask you smth? Are all of your photos up to standard? If it is not, i think you had better keep quiet than saying out nonsense. Do not pollute here with all your craps. We are sharing what is wrong with the photos. If oneday you were to develop your photos, do you want your photos be in good angle and sunlight direction? Or you want a photo which cannot let government people see? If you can show one any of your best photos, fine, i shut up here. Dare me?</div>

Mr/Mrs/Mdm/Miss TIB1062Y, the subject we are dicussing in this "Singapore Buses" forum is "BUSES". B-U-S-E-S. Repeat after me, B-U-S-E-S. As you know, buses are a form of transportation (duh).<br><br>Don't make yourself look stupid by saying about the sunlight angle and stuffs. This thread's title is called " Volvo B10M-MK2 (Photos)", which i shall explain to you, photos or pictures on Volvo B10M-MK2. So we should only see discussions on that model of bus. (Obviously, unless you failed a subject known as Common Sense).<br><br></div></blockquote>Excuse me , Bus Photography discussion is a common thing here . Open your eyes and look around . Theres even a thread that's exclusively for posting of bus pics and discuss about it.<br><br>To us , bus is NEVER a form of transportation. Its our passion. We never've regarded it as a form of transportation .<br><br>You yourself have already pointed out that this thread is about photos of the Volvo B10M MK2 . But your first sentence dont match up with your second sentence . Your first sentence says that photos of buses should be posted at Photography forum , but your second sentence says that we should post about pictures of the particular bus. What are you trying to say?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>TIB1062Y didnt bully him(the guy) at all . He's merely correcting the mistakes that the guy has done. In case you dont know, taking pictures at Interchanges has become a security threat recently. Law enforcers are taking this matter seriously and its no joke if you are being detained for taking pictures at Interchanges.</div>
