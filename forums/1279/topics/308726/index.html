              <p>1) First thing first, go and block SBS Sv 3's bus stop... I wonder where are the passengers from the MRT going to board the bus</p>
              <p>2) No inspectors at air show side, end up SOC (Ang chia) ppl takeover become bus inspectors aft situation went amok.. Even those higher officers ended up appeared at the scene</p>
              <p>3) Lack of singages. Only 1 pathetic notice "Pasir Ris Interchange... Freq: 15 mins" other than the only arrow marking nearer to Taxi stand</p>
              <p>4) Speeding buses @ 70kph... The bus I was on had this habit of speeding and swaying in and out of lanes to avoid braking (Should jolly well not speed when you know it's not safe to brake hard w/ packed load!) when approaching junctions tat just turned green. Wanna vomit sitting at the attached end</p>
              <p>Air Show organisers built a big park yet coach area cramped like siao... City Hall, Expo, Mandrain Hotel &amp; Pasir Ris shuttle cramped into 1 small area</p>

              <p><br>Cos different airshow organizer, the original airshow organizer now holds Asian Aerospace at Asia-World Expo in HK. Maybe last time the government left everything to Reed Exhibitions and dint care about everything else, now Reed Exhibitions brought its expertise over to Hong Kong.</p>

              <p>Dun just put the blame on SMRT for the poor crowd control. I was there on Saturday morning at Pasir Ris MRT stn and also at airshow. I witnessed how we Singaporeans behave.</p>

              <p>Inspector and fellow colleague smoking at the CEC bus waiting area instead of crowd control.</p>
              <p>Many MIB doing nothing. All super blur and sotong and doesnt knw how to react when hunfreds of people running and chasing to get onto the bus. Including a officer ( 2 craps on his shoulders, simi ranking huh?)</p>
              <p>FT Indian Mata SGT shouting at people who are in the proper waiting area.</p>
              <p>Bus captain who didnt follow proper instructions and let people board the bus at the alighting stop instead of boarding area.</p>
              <p>Everyone to be blame.</p>

              <p>OMG,Wonder why sbst275 very keen on SMRT Bus operations when they cannot make it on every ocassion compared to SBST?They're alrdy fucked up why still need to create one topic for this?Isn't it redundant?FYI i'm now working with SATS apron and baggage dept.Sometimes my job required me to drive tow tug truck that pull aircraft,skyloader truck for baggage lift,tractor to tow baggage trailers and sometimes apron buses like those Vanhools.I left SMRT cause of the poor management.</p>

              <p>No inspectors for crowd control... Tat day aft abt 2pm everything went amok cos like no one other, ppl also dun bother... End up ang chia fellows take over</p>

              <p>Although really, there was 1 classic drama tat occured.. 1 lady crying over spilled milk why later place those police tape and later insist to let them board 1st... be lucky tat they dun want to detain her, ask her jolly well just move with the human traffic flow (By then 2 queues were made)</p>

              <p>- They can easily pump in more buses than the crowd needs (take AA2004 AA2006 Army Open House for example). <br>- Proper boarding and alighting berths available for use @ Pasir Ris Interchange.</p>

              <p>If there were proper boarding and alighting berths, proper queues being formed at PSR Ctrl. Do you think ppl would behave this way ? <br>If the buses were able to handle the load effectively, would ppl behave this way ? <br><br>Think about it. Many ppl complaint about the taxis jamming up the road at the site. If the Shuttle buses were able to clear the load at PSR (Or even EXPO), will ppl choose to take taxis ???</p>
              <p>AA2004 and AA2006 didnt have shuttle bus problems. Queue was short and buses arriving within seconds of the bus departed.  Why did SIngapore AirShow 2008 have the problem ? You claimed that it was all due to how Singaporeans behave.. Am i ask, how come we dont have this problem in the past ??</p>

              <p>A DD with full seating already can seat more people than a bendy with full seating.<br>SBST also allowed standing, means they can actually clear the loads faster, SMRT restricted standing on the first day.</p>
