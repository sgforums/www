              This is like bus lane + the system of 'e' buses at peak hour.
                  
              But then I must take a bus to change at a BRT bus stop to take BRT. It is no better than a train. And it runs slower. And if special lanes, stops and flyovers are built, it is no more flexible than a train. 
              
              Singapore had something close to this in the past. It was called a tram.
              
              The time taken to build MRT lines can be shortened, if they build above ground. More pleasant journey too.

              <p>Some places with lots of land dun wish to spend money on MRT, rather on cheaper BRT. BRT can sometimes be better than MRT as you dun throw all the commuters on 1 line, but rather many diff bus routes.</p>

              <p>As many fellow forumers mentioned, we are pretty land scarse here and that puts us at a disadvantage on a grade seperated BRT system here. (Grade seperated, e.g. only buses running on the BRT tracks)</p>
              <p>Most successful BRT systems also run from the city center or a major transport hub towards suburb areas as a form of high-speed transport that's cheaper than building rail networks. A excellent example would be the O-Bahn Busway in Adelaide, where the buses run up to 100km/h.</p>
              <p>However the problem is we already have train lines linking most towns up (or soon will have). Buses also cannot provided as much capacity as trains can, especially our NSEW lines. So building a BRT just to link up places where the trains can do their job would just be a waste of space and money.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is, even if we cannot build such a BRT system, theres many positive points to learn from such as:</p>
              <p>- New "Rapid" services that have long disance between stops (stopping on average every 1km on a 20km route on major bus stops, vs currently stopping on average every 400meters on a 20km route can save alot of time). This sounds similar to mancha's idea where theres multiple stops along the way instead of just point to point.</p>
              <p>- Some special stops that only this "Rapid" services can stop at. Most part of the route can still use normal stops.</p>
              <p>- Make use of flyovers and flyunders as much as possible (less traffic lights)</p>
              <p>- Aim to match MRT's travelling time, yet as a slightly lower cost alternative.</p>
              <p>- Optimised seating for fast passenger turnaround on lower deck, yet provide seating on upper deck on DD.</p>
              <p>- Full width doors</p>
              <p>- If possible, Tap In only, no Tap out. Saves delay when a forgetful person cant find the card from his/her wallet/bag/purse/etc. This also prevents people from causing unecessary loading by using such "Rapid" services as feeder or for just 1 or 2 stops.</p>
              <p>Note: I use the word "Rapid" because there's already "Express" services. Its just a term.</p>

              got one idea for BRT's pilot location in Singapore.. that place is the road from Bt Timah 7th Mile till AYE. Put it in the middle of the road. used only in the peak direction. Means like a traffic island when the buses call at the bus stops. this means adding infrastructure like overhead bridges/underpasses and lifts for PIWs.  Cost may outweigh the benefits.<br>
              <br>
              <br>with this in mind, expand it to 4 lanes with 1 lane as bus lane is more cost efficient.
