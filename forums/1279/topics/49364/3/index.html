Not only the engine compartment of the LAnce 211 is painted black, almost the entire bottom is black, and the same goes for the Lance 245. In fact, most buses have black engine compartments, so that it is less likely to soot up apparently, and would make the engine more visible due to the contrast.<br><br>I think what causes the heat build up is not the colour, it is the vents at the back, got so small and so few rear vents, sure heat up one. Moreover, somebody is out of their minds to mount a rear ad over the vents of a few Lance 245s, dunno what's the freaking logic behind this.</div></blockquote>Yes, the black is to prevent visible soot buildup, also for easier detection of engine parts for maintainance. Do not forget that there is some ventilation area at the offside rear of the bus, so it would not be so badly ventilated. If the O405 can survive on that alone without blowing up like several Mk IVs and Mk IIs, why can't the Lance? It definitely has something to do with the engine.</div>

Also, the reason why Scania 113's tend to shake so much is due to the immense amount of torque the engine produces, that it idles at a low rpm....this is normal, but a lower rpm means lower compression.  Diesels alreay rattle because of the lower compression ratio as opposed to petrol, so imagine your Nissan Cedric Taxi with a 2.4 litre engine, and multiply that by 5 times, to get an 11 litre engine.  plus some 12 times the torque.
