Or the airconditioning ducts are originally built according to Malaysian Specs, which means that they do not have that industrial sized standing area, and the pitch is also larger than those we find in the S'pore ones, especially the ones at the back.<br><br>Another reason I could think of is the design is as such that some people, especially those old folks, do not want the AC blowing straight onto their head for fear of rheumatism problems, which is unlike us who want the full balst to cool down quickly. If you recall the AC ducts on the Habits, they are designed in such as weird manner for a similar reason, as I asked the TIBS guy in 2000 where the residents are treated to free rides in the neighbourhood as the Habits are first introduced. I could still remember the route was similar to the current 806, but express, and TIB1050 later appeared on 806 for some time.</div></blockquote>I took TIB 1050 G on the day of free rides, 18 June 2000.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The Tibs MB0405 AC can be further improved by cancelling out some of the noise, in my opinion. The Climatic control for the SBST ones are quite good, not too cold and not too hot mostly, but I no longer trust that AC since NAtional Day 2001, where almost all the MB0405s SBST deployed to ferry participants to the stadium are not working and we have to pop the ventilation vents, or it is a terrible blizzard, esp. the CAC ones.</div>

There isn't anything concern with the gearbox towards the emission of heat. Basically, the engine for the Volgren Bendys and the Habits are almost similiar. Also, since the engine produces a lot of torque to power the whole bus, more heat is emitted by the engine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I somehow have started to dislike Dennis Lance 211. From what I have observed from TIB 1016 G yesterday, I think that the engine compartment is painted in black colour. As a result, more heat is being radiated at the back of the bus, and thus causes the bus to warm up. Also, I feel that the alignment of the air-con outlets of Lance 211 are really bad!!! I need to do some counting b4 adjusting the air-con outlets, cos I afraid that I might adjust the wrong air-con outlet, and the person in front of me might bash me up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Another thinig is Lance 211 does not have the power to blast like a Lance 245. This is because Lance 211 has only the mere 211 bhp, which I think that it couldn't overtake a Lance 245, which has 245 bhp. Even that some drivers find that a Lance 245 is better to be driven, than a Lance 211. One more thing!!! In the day, the air-con could not cool the internal of the bus. I wonder how could a Lance 211 makes passengers feel comfy in the bus.</div>

Not only the engine compartment of the LAnce 211 is painted black, almost the entire bottom is black, and the same goes for the Lance 245. In fact, most buses have black engine compartments, so that it is less likely to soot up apparently, and would make the engine more visible due to the contrast.<br><br>I think what causes the heat build up is not the colour, it is the vents at the back, got so small and so few rear vents, sure heat up one. Moreover, somebody is out of their minds to mount a rear ad over the vents of a few Lance 245s, dunno what's the freaking logic behind this.</div>

But heck, TIBS is selling those Brits already, so I think they are using them as trial purposes, and if there are no fires etc, they may consider installing them on the LAnce 211s. Can't imagine what will happen, it will be like adding fuel to the fire</div>
