Airbus330Captain saw one few days ago. Also, I'm hoping that service 962 and 963 won't get it, that goes to service 859 also, since the sub buses are from AMKDEP. Sadly, ELBO has already invaded into service 963 fleet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Or the airconditioning ducts are originally built according to Malaysian Specs, which means that they do not have that industrial sized standing area, and the pitch is also larger than those we find in the S'pore ones, especially the ones at the back.<br><br>Another reason I could think of is the design is as such that some people, especially those old folks, do not want the AC blowing straight onto their head for fear of rheumatism problems, which is unlike us who want the full balst to cool down quickly. If you recall the AC ducts on the Habits, they are designed in such as weird manner for a similar reason, as I asked the TIBS guy in 2000 where the residents are treated to free rides in the neighbourhood as the Habits are first introduced. I could still remember the route was similar to the current 806, but express, and TIB1050 later appeared on 806 for some time.</div>
