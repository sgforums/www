              <p>Was hoping that 122 will be amended to CTE and Jalan Bukit Merah
              to Kampong Bahru instead of through Outram Rd as it duplicates 121
              extensively between Kampong Bahru and Lower Delta Rd... I mean
              seriously, literally no one ever takes 122 at Outram Park Stn
              unless it happens to arrive before 33/63/851 and at least amending
              it to Jalan Bukit Merah would create an unique link between Tiong
              Bahru MRT and Jalan Bukit Merah but no, that would make too much
              sense for LTA....</p>
              <p>As for 120, wouldn't cutting short to Kampong Bahru
              inconvenience those who rely on 120 to travel to SGH?</p>

              <p>I agree they need to do something with 122 route. In spite of huge development along Queenstown estate, 122 does not have good loading because of the way its route has been created. 122 between Tiong Bahru and Outram always empty. Should have used this opportunity to extend to Marina Center or Shenton Way (at least) or use your suggestion. </p>
              <p>120 no problem. It is almost empty after Lower Delta. </p>

              <p>Imo, since you mentioned Shenton Way, 186 can absorb 122's route since it parallels 122 from Queenstown to Tiong Bahru by making it skip C'wealth Ave and Ganges Ave and do 122's route from Margaret Dr to Tiong Bahru Rd instead...</p>

              <p>135 can merge with 40, while 47 be made to ply East Coast Road in both directions and extended to MacPherson.</p>
              <p>In short, 40 gets removed and gets supplanted by an augmented 135 (AMK-BDK), which will provide Siglap with a direct link with Parkway Parade. Meanwhile, 47 will skip Parkway Parade altogether and use East Coast Road in addition to being extended to loop at MacPherson Estate.</p>
              <p>Another solution would be a three-way merger of 47, 125 and 135 resulting in 135 looping at Sims Drive while 125 gets extended to CBP taking over portions of 135 and 47; and 40 gets amended to ply Marine Parade due to the removal of 47. I believe this had been proposed before at Routes.one.</p>

              <p>The route is quite badly planned. 32 has poor frequency to Redhill. 122 to Tiong Bahru is not like the closest MRT + doesn't have a great frequency because of poor loading. Hence, people walk even if they don't prefer to. </p>
              <p>122 should have just looped around Queenstown MRT and come back via Dawson road. Usually LTA plans for door step access to estates but in case of Queenstown/Margaret estate both 32/122 are not well planned. Even 32 continues to have poor loading inspite of 2 huge BTOs ready for few years.</p>

              <p>Imo, since you mentioned Shenton Way, 186 can absorb 122's route
              since it parallels 122 from Queenstown to Tiong Bahru by making it
              skip C'wealth Ave and Ganges Ave and do 122's route from Margaret
              Dr to Tiong Bahru Rd instead...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think that's a good suggestion. 186 can be diverted via Queenstown MRT, Dawson Road, Kay Siang, Tanglin to Alexandra road and then via Tiong Bahru, Havelock towards Shenton Way.</p>
              <p>51 will continue to be direct alternative between Queenstown and Havelock.</p>
              <p>The challenge will be that those from Ganges will lose direct connection to Shenton Way. This probably can be managed by 121 extended to Shenton Way via Havelock as 186 has huge loading in peak hours between Havelock and Shenton (this is where DDs get 100+ pax between 0800 and 0900am) and 121 can help alleviate the loading on 186. </p>
              <p>122 can then be totally scrapped. </p>

              <p>970 doesn't exactly have such high loading to take pressure off. 122 can just loop around Queenstown MRT and come back via Dawson. </p>

              <p>Hi mr marvel68, most people who live in holland avenue will alight at commonwealth mrt and switch to smrt 970 which is direct. 2 stops later, they will reach Blk 10 bus stop. If take mrt to buona vista mrt, they still have to walk a long passageway to change to holland village mrt then walk again to the neighbouring blocks. Who in right sense of mind will choose the 2nd method which is more indirect?</p>
              <p>Moreover, the demographic population in holland avenue/drive is more of elderly. Please do not expect people living there to walk to mrt often. I quote my mother as a living example. She has leg pains. She always takes mrt to commonwealth to switch to 32/145 to get to Blk 46 bus stop along holland drive. Fastest way is to alight at buona vista mrt and walk back. If you have been to buona vista mrt before, you will know the road path to the blocks st holland drive is not so conducive. There is also flight of steps and a busy road. It poses quite a challenge to elderly. Trust me, many elderly living there have the same thoughts. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
