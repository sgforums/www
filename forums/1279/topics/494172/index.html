                                          <p>The idea of Marina South bus terminal has been around for many years. There was a bus terminal at Marina South Pier, <a href="https://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2006mar_30-1.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">with only bus service 402 calling at that bus terminal</span></a>, between 2006 and 2011. But from the looks of it, the idea may have been scrapped.</p>

                          <p>Wow. Thanks for sharing with us the plan for the upcoming Yishun bus interchange. 
                                      With 46 parking lots planned, for 23 bus services, this means that every bus service would have 2 parking lots, and at least one new service would be introduced at Yishun bus interchange in the future.</p>

But at least now there is a better plan, in developing the area around Jurong East MRT Station.</p>
                                                                          
                                                                          <p>Besides, the new temporary bus interchange would be in use for around seven years (2018-2025), before the new permanent bus interchange is ready. The current temporary bus interchange has already been in used for six years (2011-2017), that by now it should have already "recovered the costs".</p>
                                                                      
                                                                      <p>By the time the permanent bus interchange is ready, the new temporary bus interchange would also have recovered the costs.</p>
                      
                      <p>Therefore, I think it should be okay to build a new temporary bus interchange to replace the current temporary bus interchange, to make way for a new permanent bus interchange.</p>

              ambiguity there was back then. But at least now there is a better
              plan, in developing the area around Jurong East MRT Station.</p>
              <p>Besides, the new temporary bus interchange would be in use for
              around seven years (2018-2025), before the new permanent bus
              interchange is ready. The current temporary bus interchange has
              already been in used for six years (2011-2017), that by now it
              should have already "recovered the costs".</p>
              <p>By the time the permanent bus interchange is ready, the new
              temporary bus interchange would also have recovered the costs.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I think it should be okay to build a new temporary
              bus interchange to replace the current temporary bus interchange,
              to make way for a new permanent bus interchange.</p>

              <p>18 services... That is if you consider 97 and 97e as one, 98 and 98M as one and 143 and 143M as one.Â </p>
              <p>Anyways, this is quite telling that the PCS service and CW3/4 which is currently at the int will be moved out. I am predicting that the former would be moved to a bus stop elsewhere in the JE MRT vincity, while the cross borders may face the same fate, or may be relocated to the new Tuas ter. Got a feeling that any changes to that will have to wait till the opening of the new ter...</p>
