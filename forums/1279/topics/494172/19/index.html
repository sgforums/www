              <p>Recently, the government announced the stations and alignments
              of Jurong Region Line. I only have one comment: the station are
              obviously designed with future developments in mind. Otherwise,
              who’s going to contribute money to the line when it begins revenue
              service 8 years from now? I’m writing this with the “Peng Kang
              Hill” station in mind. ä¸�å�¯èƒ½ they will build a MRT station in the
              middle of nowhere, where people usually won’t go. Or build a MRT
              station at a location where there’s already very good public
              transport connections to existing MRT stations. (Eg. Gek Poh) For
              sure they have plans to rejuvenate the existing areas along the
              Jurong Region Line, otherwise why would they even have this line -
              besides serving the upcoming Tengah residential town?</p>
              <p>Jurong West is old, and would require some form of
              gentrification in about 10-20 years’ time. Likewise for the older
              part of Choa Chu Kang. And of course, Jurong East Toh Guan
              area.</p>
              <p>To some extent, Jurong Region Line is like the Docksland Light
              Railway in London. Docksland Light Railway helped to rejuvenate the
              Docksland area which became run down after its original trade
              gradually faded away due to some industrial revolution. Jurong
              Region Line, in this case, seems to have the purpose of
              revitalizing the western part of Singapore (Jurong West, Jurong
              East, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang), so that it does not deteriorate
              into some rundown area in future.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the government also has plans to rejuvenate the
              eastern part of Singapore after the Paya Lebar Airport relocates to
              Changi. Everywhere is rejuvenating, and Jurong Region Line is just
              one of the measures to implement the rejuvenation.</p>

              <p>During the Mahathir era, usually the more upscale infrastructure projects like LRT they would ask the private sector to co-fund, or fund entirely. (Eg. The STAR LRT) but those projects failed and had to be bailed out by the government because of (1) the lack of integration with other public transport routes, and (2) the surrounding areas were probably less-developed then.</p>
                                      <p>I know this is not related to Mahathir.</p>
                                      <p>My point is, large-scale infrastructure projects that require a lot of money, for example LRT and bus depot, the government is already asking the private sector for help to co-fund it (unless they got a lot of money). Let alone use it for a short period of time and then demolish it.</p>

              <p>Do anybody think that the stations for the JRL are located too close to each other, to the extent that MRT operations may not be practical. For example, the distance between Bahar Junction and Gek Poh (less than 2 bus stops) and the three stations within NTU.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The distance between Bahar Junction and Jurong West could also be a little to close. Same for the distance between Jurong West and Corporation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a feeling this line will end up to be like BPLRT...</p>

              <p>About the Jurong Region Line, there is a long-time concern that Pioneer Primary School may be affected because the campus happens to be in the trajectory.</p>
                                          <p>What I feel is, it wonâ€™t be affected. In fact, the â€œtight turningâ€� part already got me thinking of the skytrain at Changi Airport. Most probably they will build a structure along the small space between Pioneer Primary School and Blk 863, and most probably the way the Jurong Region Line trains turn will be like how the Changi Airport skytrains turn.</p>
                                          <p>In fact, the way the Jurong Region Line runs along densely populated areas, even closer to HDB flats than the LRT, already resembles how the Changi Airport skytrain runs right beside the buildings at Changi Airport.</p>
                                          <p>For those who want a preview of Jurong Region Line, the Changi Airport skytrain and Sengkang-Punggol LRT is a good reference to take. In fact, Jurong Region Line is like a combination of the two: Changi Airport skytrain trains and viaducts, and Sengkang-Punggol LRT route layout. In short, just go Changi Airport take skytrain if you want to experience taking trains at tight spaces. But the speed is definitely the same as Sengkang-Punggol LRT.</p>
                                          <p>Whereas for Bahar Junction, Iâ€™m expecting the same kind of junction that is present at Sengkang LRT and Punggol LRT.</p>

                              <p>A possible replacement site is Jurong West Street 93, behind the stadium. Otherwise, Jurong West Avenue 3 that empty field, opposite the HDB flats.</p>
                              <p>If Pioneer Primary were to close, they would have announced it already. There are primary schools merging, but Pioneer Primary is not one of them. Jurong West still has an adequate demand to support all the primary schools in the area.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, Jurong West Street 93 is quite far from any primary school as compared to other areas. If Pioneer Primary were to relocate there, it would rationalize the resources.</p>
                          <p>Thirdly, it is along 99 bus route. Pioneer Primary students residing along Jurong West Avenue 5 can take 99 to the new location. The only consequence is having to travel longer distances, but that should not be a problem.</p>

              <p>In terms of new flats, the newer flats are in Boon Lay area. So practically, Boon Lay may need another primary school besides Boon Lay Garden, and Pioneer Primary can relocate there. Recently, the former Jurong Fire Station site and former Boon Lay Secondary campus have been demolished. Thereâ€™s a lot of vacant land in Boon Lay now. And if Boon Lay needs additional primary school supply, Pioneer Primary can relocate there.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Unfortunately, itâ€™s not along 99 bus route. But we can consider rerouting 258 for the purpose of connecting Pioneer Primaryâ€™s current serving area to the new location.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Or for the matter, demolish Jurong JC after it is closed down this year and build a replacement primary school at that location. Opposite got new BTO recently completed last year. Would really complement all the new residential developments, which happens to be in Boon Lay and around Jurong West Avenue 1. Furthermore, the location is along 185 and 99 bus routes; which would enable existing Pioneer Primary School students and teachers living around the current location to travel to the new location without transferring buses.</p>
                              
                              <p>Anyway, what I want to say is, thereâ€™s potential for Pioneer Primary to relocate to another location in Jurong West.</p>
