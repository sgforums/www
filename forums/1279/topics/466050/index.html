              <p>Dear all, <br><br>Just a very gentle reminder to those who is taking the Singapore's public transport to work, my experience with them wasn't all that pleasant and I would like to share it around. <br><br>When I alighted a crowded bus 72 this morning everything was fine until the alighting part. I cautiously waited until the bus door opened and the ENTRY/EXIT wording before tapping my card. And so I waited, the door was about to open and the ez-link machine is displaying ENTRY/EXIT, the man in front of me was impatient and tapped before the door opened and was fine. The door already opened so ,I went on ahead to tap after him but again I was shocked to see this NEW RIDE coming out. So I talked to the driver about it and he was rude, claimed that it was my fault that I did not waited till the bus door opened. But I did, he kept on trying to held me responsible for the problem and due to a lack of time I just went rushing off to work, going to complain him later. Paid $4.24 coming to work when my normal fare is only $1.80, overcharged by 235% of my normal fare. <br><br>Before you say i niao or what, im actually a clerk. One month $420 and camp got no cookhouse, recently got promoted so pay about $500. But the cold Singapore elitist system will rip me off heartlessly, one of which is this. Ok, a little poor now but still managing, thanks SBS for contributing a little bit to that problem. Because the catch is, you have to wait 1 month and a few more days before you can get your refund.</p>
              <p>Another important point is, out of these 2 times I got double charged, one is on the latest ez-link machine and one is on the old ez-link machine.....upgraded but still continue to charge people like that? <br><br><br>It is highly illogical by the way, to wait until the front door is fully opened and possibly even longer if the operator forgot to switch the mode, if the BUS is already THAT crowded and people flooding to board the BUS. They are talking about bringing our population to 6.9m and the last thing I want to see is many people paying twice or more of their transport fare travelling to work. <br><br>Kenna this the second time already....<br><br><br>First time was in january but I wasn't aware of this and the operator let me know, it took pretty long like 30-45 minute to go through the claim process. As after 5pm they say I can only go to outram park MRT, so travelled there 5-10 min, queued and walked for the operator to process my case that's like 15-20 minutes. I was told to keep the receipt and wait for the collection date to claim my refund, which is after 1 months later from feb to apr.</p>

              <p>I kena that before. Twice.</p>
              <p>Both times their website got server error and couldn't process my info. Both times I had to call them up personally to demand a refund. Both times I asked why they couldn't just make the front readers on permanent ENTRY/EXIT mode. Both times they gave some lame excuse about fare evaders.</p>
              <p>So from then on I just barge my way through the hordes of passengers who refuse to give way to me when I want to alight from the center exit. So much easier than going through all that red tape.</p>

              <p>just claim online, save the hassle.</p>
              <p>i would suggest you to get FareBot from Google Play if you are using Flashpay.instant tracking of your rides instead of finding a purple or sliver machine to check.</p>
              <p>I understand that your fare is $4.24, would you mind giving a breakdown of the fares charged for each leg of your journey? If you have timestamp on the timing that you tapped, even better.</p>
              <p>and OT: CPL now $500 already ah?</p>
