            <div class='col-md body'>Its possible for SBSTransit to get into Sembawang, but the fact of the lousy PTC control policy means it would not be an easy task.<br><br>Perhaps when Sembawang has a new interchange? Well, at least SBST made a rather successful foray into Yishun with svc 39 to break TIBS's monopoly of svc 969, and its 7 months since last August and as far as i had seen, its doing pretty well.</div>
