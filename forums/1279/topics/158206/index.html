In the long run, you might end up suffering from depression.  Speak to your parents or guardian or whoever.  Talk to an adult.<br><br>3) i believe it's about your own character.  Why dun you do a self reflection first?<br><br>4) Such things occur everywhere.  Maybe ppl r jealous of you; maybe by your actions and stuff ppl misunderstand u.  Someone once told me that there's always someone who will always be the butt of people's teasing &amp; torment.  Unfortunately for you, you happen to be the object of attention.<br><br>5) You can simply choose to ignore them, but at your age, it's difficult.<br><br>6) You can simply wreck revenge on them (not advisable), but then again, when you do so, make sure you do not flout the school rules or the law.<br><br>7) Most importantly, read Point 2 and think about it.<br><br>Well, no one can stop the bullying for you.  You just have to make the best use of whatever situation you are in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have a psychological problem - autophobia, or rather the phobia of being alone. Humans are innately defensive and from what I've read, you are putting the blame on your hobby just because "mommy, nobody wants to friend me".<br><br>1. In the first place, you didn't say anything about mentioning your hobby to your friends, so what makes you so sure that it is because of your hobby that your friends are shunning you? Could it be something that you can't possibly see on your own - your character?<br><br>2. In your views, it seems that you feel you are being ostracised by your "desired friends" but aren't you doing the same thing by ostracising your so-called "undesirables"?<br><br>3. Religion isn't something that you say you want to take up because you are being shunned. I sincerely hope that you will think about this seriously before you spout such stuff. Are you even prepared to be a monk?<br><br>4. You said you are superstituous. Perhaps reducing the number of "damn" will be beneficial to you?</div>

Everytime I talk about bus things to them, they won't mind at all but sometimes they will not listen to it. I rarely speak those to them. How about trying talking on topics that suits everybody??? Then everybody will join in the discussion. Like go where and eat, BGR and .................... But sometimes when talking to them, you also must have precaution don't anyhow blast your words out as some are sensitive to some people and they may don't like it. Try mixing around from friends,  teachers, toilet cleaners, workers, security and so on and not focusing on one group only. So like that would better and there is at least somebody there for you to talk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Take care <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But don't result to violence, if they disturb you just ignore them like me or else tell it to the teachers can already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I can understand and emphatise how you feel.<br><br>Personally for me, I will not be discriminated due to my liking of buses. I don't think superstition plays a part in this. To your second question, no. There is no reason whatsoever why transportation fans are always being ostracised.<br><br>As for the resolution, I suggest:<br><br>1: Ask yourself if you've done anything wrong unknowingly. Speak to a teacher whom you can rely on and ask him/her what are your flaws. Try to improve on them. Nothing is perfect.<br><br>2: Perhaps you don't even need to bother about those "friends" of yours at all. If they are just a bunch of undesirable people, just try your best to ignore them! They'll get tired of that. Rule of the thumb: Stay NONCHALANT.<br><br>3: I know it is not that easy, but why don't you try to make new friends? I believe that at least there can be a few loyal friends waiting to be found in your school!<br><br>4: Whatever the case, just do what YOU want to do. Do not drop this unique hobby of yours due to peer pressure, etc.<br><br>Thats all. I really hope you will find your true friends and be a joyful person. Jia you!</div>

It is like I have discovered that I am interested in bus routes, in roads and currently now trying to recognise landmarks and scenary in Singapore and this thing or talent that we have is very different from others. So, I do not talk much of this with my friends.<br><br>During secondary school, during that one lesson conducted by my geography teacher, she talked about Singapore, about taking bus 80 and that took about one hour plus from Sengkang to Chinatown. Then I don't know what spurs me to say something like "Taking bus 147 to Chinatown is faster" but in actual fact I don't know which is faster. Then that teacher just tested me in front of the class on some services like 196, 2, 197 and a few more which most of them are plying in eastern towns.<br>Many of my classmates and friends know that I am a bus freak or rather a bus route freak as I insist on taking only bus to my destination. Some of them are really happy for me and some even advise me to become a bus captain. Heheh. I start to talk more and more about buses when my friends ask me how I get home because they are surprised by my answers I gave them. There are so many ways to get from one destination to another destination by bus only and it is really challenging to keep on searching new ways. (most preferably if you have concession bus stamp)<br><br>So, what I have learnt is that don't be afraid to say it out. This is a talent, a hobby and a passion. If you really like the joy of memorsing bus routes or knowing the types of buses or engines of the buses and so on, develop this flame that is burning within you. I believe that friends will not isolate you just because there is a "freak" among them.<br><br>I believe that my interests in buses has spurred my interests in numbers too. I use to study for patterns of buses by looking at the regos before I know of this forum. Like SBS 94xx has yellow bars at the entrance and exit doors and the seats are red. SBS 90xx to 93xx have blue seats. That helps me to find new number patterns and be really sensitive with numbers.</div>
