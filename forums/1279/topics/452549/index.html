              <p>Time has changed, if it is a requirement to buy new buses fully low floor, then just have to accept it.</p>
              <p>Bus operators thus have to improve the frequencies or use more double deckers to ease the crowd. I don't like the idea of crash loading, as carrying to many people in the standing area isn't comfortable and safe as well.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally I still prefer LE bus than fully low floor bus (except Wrights). I still prefer climbing that bit of steps on a LE bus than climbing onto the seats on the fully low floor bus. A LE bus is more spacious and can accomodate more standing pax. As the seats and aisle on the higher part of a LE bus is generally level, seating is much more comfortable than fully low floor bus configuration.</div>

              I believe most commuters are getting used to LE bus already, so the issue of danger at the steps is greatly reduced. And I find more pax willing to stand on the higher aisle than before. I think the top horizontal setion of the bar above the steps that is supporting the handstraps should be fixed lower than the others so that pax can be further reminded of the steps below.
              
              If the aisle steps on LE bus is considered dangerous, I believe even with fully low floor bus, those steps are also equally dangerous to me.

              <p>Wah this government rly overboard oredi... Sucking us commuters money by increasing fares and stuff JUST to get the buses they claim is "better"... When in fact we ppl dun even like it at all. Dangerous somemore!!!</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">Anyway, I can list down all the damn problems of LF buses here:</span></p>
              <p>LF buses:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>poses as a danger to commuters with leg injuries/diseases, as The steps at the back to the seats are quite high, and will be a great difficulty for them to come down.   </li>
              <li>causes great inconvenience during peak hours when commuters have to stand during the ride. Less ppl can fit in the bus, and the aisles are so narrow the commuters have to stand on the platforms instead. Remember, complaints have started to come in since the third citaro is registered, and the complaints didn't stop since after. </li>
              <li>is hard to maintain, and hard to repair when system goes wrong. As the design for LF buses are extremely complex, it is hard to trace down problems for newcomers.</li>
              <li>can get DAMN hot at the back during long-haul rides or during the times when the engine is working at full power, thus making passengers seated at the back unbearably uncomfortable, especially the one seated next to/in front of the engine box (mostly apply to SD)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>See the problems? For LE buses, only one or two say the problem is at the steps. For that, the only problem caused by the steps is when some careless idiots dun watch where they are going, trip over the steps and pokai, making a fool of themselves. This can be prevented however.             </p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion: LTA, Don't implicate us by increasing our fares and buying more expensive LF buses. We dunnid them to make our lives btr but our lives WILL be btr without them.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><em>P.S. I noe that SMB228X will rebutt on seeing this, so I will just make it clear: if you love Citaros so much, and wan to write in to SBST, u can, but AT LEAST tell them to get the low entry ones ok??? </em></span>                                                   </p>

              <p>None of your complaints are justified in my opinion.</p>
              <p>1. Those who are less mobile will more than likely sit closer to the front of the bus for ease of alighting and so that it is easier for them to alert the driver if they require further assistance, so the seats at the rear of the bus are not an issue.</p>
              <p>2. With respect to peak period buses, standing room is more important than seating room, because you can fit more people onto a bus when there are more standees.  More people per bus = higher efficiency of service.</p>
              <p>3. A low floor bus is no harder to maintain than a low entry bus.  There are similar constaints in relation to where equipment must be fitted, and the engines used are identical to engines found on low entry buses.</p>
              <p>4. Regarding the rear engine creating a warmer interior environment on a bus, again, how is a low floor bus different from a low entry bus?  Both have their engines mounted above the rear overhang.</p>
              <p>Low floor buses are SAFER for the travelling public, as there is no danger of passengers tripping or falling on steps while the bus is in motion.  The single step that is adjacent to the rearmost seats are unlikely to cause any problems since there are ample handholds and staunchions located at that part of the bus so that passengers can stabilise themselves if necessary.  In contrast, today's low entry buses will have two or more steps leading to a very high rear platform.</p>
              <p>Additionally, low floor buses promote a smooth passenger flow throughout the bus and are therefore unrivalled when it comes to loading and unloading times.</p>

STFU AND GO LEARN UR ABC, INSTEAD OF BEING A MUDABITCH AND SPAMMING UR NONSENSE HERE.  Retarded f***, there r steep steps to the side seats too, duh! </p>
              <p>And wat if there is only ONE seat at the axle area and the person wif leg disabilities cannot sit there cause of steep steps? One very steep steps can make difficultie rather than two easy steps leh, ah boy. </p>
              <p>And pls, the comments u commented earlier here on are all shit too, u nvr experience the feeling of taking LF buses b4. I, as a very frequent commuter of 109, can tell citaros of this kind are DEFINITELY not supposed to be on Singapore roads AT ALL, kid.</p>
