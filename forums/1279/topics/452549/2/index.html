              <p>Wah this government rly overboard oredi... Sucking us commuters
              money by increasing fares and stuff JUST to get the buses they
              claim is "better"... When in fact we ppl dun even like it at all.
              Dangerous somemore!!!</p>
              <p><span>Anyway, I can list down all the damn problems of
              LF buses here:              
                               
                 </span></p>
              <p><span>LF buses:          
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               
                               
                     - poses as a danger to commuters with
              leg injuries/diseases, as The steps at the back to the seats are
              quite high, and will be a great difficulty for them to come down.
                               
                          - causes great
              inconvenience during peak hours when commuters have to stand during
              the ride. Less ppl can fit in the bus, and the aisles are so narrow
              the commuters have to stand on the platforms instead. Remember,
              complaints have started to come in since the third citaro is
              registered, and the complaints didn't stop since after.  
                               
                  - is hard to maintain, and hard to repair when system
              goes wrong. As the design for LF buses are extremely complex, it is
              hard to trace down problems for newcomers.      
                  - can get DAMN hot at the back during long-haul rides
              or during the times when the engine is working at full power, thus
              making passengers seated at the back unbearably uncomfortable,
              especially the one seated next to/in front of the engine box
              (mostly apply to SD)</span></p>
              <p>See the problems? For LE buses, only one or two say the problem
              is at the steps. For that, the only problem caused by the steps is
              when some careless idiots dun watch where they are going, trip over
              the steps and pokai, making a fool of themselves. This can be
              prevented however.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion: LTA, Don't implicate us by increasing our
              fares and buying more expensive LF buses. We dunnid them to make
              our lives btr but our lives WILL be btr without them.</strong></p>

              rebutt on seeing this, so I will just make it clear: if you love

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>None of your complaints are justified in my opinion.</p>
              <p>1. Those who are less mobile will more than likely sit closer to
              the front of the bus for ease of alighting and so that it is easier
              for them to alert the driver if they require further assistance, so
              the seats at the rear of the bus are not an issue.</p>
              <p>2. With respect to peak period buses, standing room is more
              important than seating room, because you can fit more people onto a
              bus when there are more standees.  More people per bus =
              higher efficiency of service.</p>
              <p>3. A low floor bus is no harder to maintain than a low entry
              bus.  There are similar constaints in relation to where
              equipment must be fitted, and the engines used are identical to
              engines found on low entry buses.</p>
              <p>4. Regarding the rear engine creating a warmer interior
              environment on a bus, again, how is a low floor bus different from
              a low entry bus?  Both have their engines mounted above the
              rear overhang.</p>
              <p>Low floor buses are SAFER for the travelling public, as there is
              no danger of passengers tripping or falling on steps while the bus
              is in motion.  The single step that is adjacent to the
              rearmost seats are unlikely to cause any problems since there are
              ample handholds and staunchions located at that part of the bus so
              that passengers can stabilise themselves if necessary.  In
              contrast, today's low entry buses will have two or more steps
              leading to a very high rear platform.</p>
              <p>Additionally, low floor buses promote a smooth passenger flow
              throughout the bus and are therefore unrivalled when it comes to
              loading and unloading times.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>See low floor bus are safer and can carry more than low entry bus!!! I am correct all the way!!! So SBS and SMRT must get 800 more Euro VI Citaros!!!!</p>

              <p>And wat if there is only ONE seat at the axle area and the

              <p>I don't know what is the big fuss about LF and LE buses.</p>
              <p>When LE buses was firstly introduced, many people complained about it because people are not used to the 2 steps behind and lesser seats than a normal bus. A pharse of change people were unhappy.</p>
              <p>Because of all these complains, which is still ongoing, LF buses are introduced. Now people complain again. Narrow aisles, less spacious, etc. Another pharse of change people not happy again.</p>
              <p>Seriously, I don't know what bus companies can do or buy what bus to satisfy these people. Buy this, complain, buy that, also complain. And the most absurd thing that many bus fans know why the narrow aisle is because of the rear wheels and engine placements. I don't think this problem will exist forever because bus manufacturers will most likely consider this flaw and improve the designs for their future models. WHy need to complain so much?</p>
              <p>I do agree that LE is more dangerous because of the 2 steps towards the back. If steps are unavoidable, then might as well have those normal buses with steps in front and at the back doors. At least it is safer for people to climb up and down of them when the bus is stationary, rather than climbing up and down the steps inside the LE bus when the bus is moving.</p>
              <p>Some people here don't like the Citaros. Then blame SMRT for introducing it in the first place. SMRT shouldn't even buy the Citaro at all.                                  </p>

              have those normal buses with steps in front and at the back
              doors. At least it is safer for people to climb up and down of them
              when the bus is stationary, rather than climbing up and down the
              steps inside the LE bus when the bus is moving.</p>
              <p>Some people here don't like the Citaros. Then blame SMRT
              for introducing it in the first place. SMRT shouldn't even buy the
              Citaro at
              all.                                  </p>

              <p>Just when I was thinking that your posts were getting more sensible and you had to resort to using such language towards someone who spent time reasoning the advantages and disadvantages of LF buses. That was very much uncalled for and the least you could do was to argue in a sensible manner.</p>

              </p><p>Ok. I shall just say out the points what SMB128B and the others had said.</p>
              <p>1. In Carbikebus's post (the starting post), he said that low floor buses had less standing areas than low entry buses, but in CNG's post, he claimed that standing rooms is more important than seating rooms, which means he should support low entry buses, but instead he supported low floor buses (though he was countering SMB128B's post), which is already a wrong justification. </p>
              <p>2. In SMB128B's post (posted 21st May 2012, 1.43pm) he said that people with leg injuries/diseases are unable to come down from the back row of seats, while in CNG's post, he said that those people will likely sit close to the front of the bus and alert the driver to assist them alight, so he think the back row of seats should be no problem. But the problem is, there's a great difference in distance from the driver's seat to the back row of the bus. How is the passenger with the symptoms stated above going to alert the driver at the back row if he/she cannot come down?</p>
              <p>3. According to SBS3688Y's post, many people had been getting used to the LE buses and thus it might reduce the risk of falling down. If it is really the case, why is the grabpoles there? It served as a side need for people who can't go up the stairs properly. Even if CNG's post mentioned there will be a high platform, but I doubt many people can adjust to the low floor buses which was just massively introduced last year.</p>
              <p>I just really hope this post will justify my points and others to make the ones who support the low floor buses to understand the main problems.</p>

              <p>Sorry but it seems like you did not get my point for the 2nd part. The main problem itself is the alerting of drivers and the rear seats (which is the back row of seats, unless you are referring to another row of seats) with the stairs, it even renders the less mobile impossible to alert the drivers from such a distance.</p>
