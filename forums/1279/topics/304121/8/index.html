              <p>SBS8112J, I can tell that you have a talent in editing the pictures. However, the photos you've taken to edit do not belong to you in the first place. I know you claimed that you have emailed the owner of the photo for permission, but you have not receive his grant. So you have no right to  use the picture until he officially give you the</p>
              <p>green light. It is an offence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The images are considered an interllectual property. You can be sued for infringing copyright. I am sure you would not want to get yourself into trouble right? I suggest you should take pictures by yourself, and edit your own pictures. I am not chiding you but giving you an advice. You can choose not to listen, no one would stop you any further. We have given you advises,and we hope you would understand the situation. You are still young, it is not worth it leaving behind a record.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
