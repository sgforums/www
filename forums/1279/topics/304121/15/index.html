              <p>I know how easy it is to take the simple way out by ignoring the replies to your wonderful post of that 9888Y, create a new identity and start afresh. In fact I'm very surprised if you had not already done or contemplated to do so.</p>
              <p>To the amount of effort you placed in copying, removing and pasting the copyright logo, do the edits and finally post it online, I'm pretty amazed that you do not even bother to send a simple e-mail to the owner to the gallery to request for permission.</p>
              <p>Fine if you still insist on blatantly copying and editing it, but its a fact that your photoshopped photo is a great disgrace to this special bus and the community...to put it simply it sooooo simple to identify the edits as they are so poorly done that it would be insulting the intelligence of the members here!</p>
              <p>Do note that your imageshack account will be terminated by imageshack if it is reported as being abused. As a warning, previous members who have used the photos of others without permission have their photo hosting sites terminated as it constitutes as an abuse under the terms of conditions.</p>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">12.1.1<strong>Â Â Â Â  </strong>Copyright is the term used to describe the bundle of rights that is granted by statute in respect of original works and other subject-matter for limited periods of time and subject to certain permitted exceptions. In Singapore, that statute is the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1999 Rev ed) (âCAâ). Unlike registered designs and patents, copyright is not a monopoly. It is essentially a negative right to prevent copying. This means that if two identical works were in fact produced independently of one another, there is no infringement of copyright by one of the other (<a href="http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/11310.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chua Puay Kiang v Singapore Telecommunications Limited [2000] 3 SLR 640</span></a>).</span></div>

Rather, copyright only protects the way in which they are expressed.Â Further, copyright protects the skill, labour and/or judgment used in creating the expression. In particular, copyright subsists in literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works (âworksâ or âa workâ), such as novels, plays, musical compositions, paintings and sculptures, as well as in subject-matter other than the works, such as sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programmes and published editions of works. Additionally, copyright protection is available in respect of live performances and rights management information, such as information identifying the author of a work and the terms and conditions relating to the use of the work.Â </span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">12.1.3<strong>Â Â Â Â  </strong>Copyright arises immediately upon creation. Specifically, there is copyright protection in a work as soon as it is expressed or fixed in a material form (e.g. paper, tape and film) from which it is capable of being reproduced. Unlike registered designs, patents and trade marks, there are no formalities required for copyright to subsist and no system of registration of rights. In general, copyright subsists in a work or subject-matter in Singapore if (1) the work or subject-matter was first published or made in Singapore or in a member country of the Berne Convention or the WTO; or (2) the author of the work or the maker of the subject was a citizen or resident of Singapore or of a member country of the Berne Convention or the WTO at the time when the work was first published or made. </span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">12.1.4<strong>Â Â Â Â  </strong>Generally, copyright in a literary, dramatic or musical work, or in an artistic work other than a photograph, subsists during the life of the author plus 70 years after his death. In the case of a sound recording and film, copyright subsists until the expiry of 70 years after the expiry of the calendar year in which the recording or film was first published. The duration of copyright protection for a broadcast and cable programme is 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast was made or the programme was first included in a cable programme service. The duration of copyright protection for a published edition of a work or works is 25 years from the expiry of the calendar year in which the edition was first published. </span></div>

These acts are intended to strike a fair balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public interest. They include acts (popularly known as âfair dealingsâ) for the purposes of research and study, criticism or review, and reporting current events. To constitute fair dealing for research and study, not more than an article in a periodical or a reasonable proportion of a work (generally, 10% of the pages or a chapter) is to be taken, and the court is also to have regard to such factors as the nature of the work, the amount and substantiality of the part of the work that was copied in relation to the whole work as well as the effect on the potential market. In respect of fair dealing for criticism or review, or for reporting current events, there must also be a sufficient acknowledgement of the work. </span></div>

For instance, the copyright owner can license or assign the right to reproduce his work in a material form to one person and the right to perform the work in public to another person. He can also license or assign the copyright in terms of the whole or part of the copyright period or by geographical area. As a result, there can be a bewilderingly large number of licensees and/or owners of different parts of the copyright in a work. </span></div>

A licence which is not in writing does not bind subsequent assignees of the copyright except a bona fide purchaser for value who does not know of the licence. A licence may be exclusive or non-exclusive. An exclusive licence even excludes the licensor (i.e. the copyright owner) from doing whatever the licence permits â that is, the exclusive licensee is almost the owner of the copyright. Indeed, section 123 of the CA treats an exclusive licensee as the owner for many purposes connected with remedies, as it states that the rights and remedies of an exclusive licence are concurrent with those of the copyright owner.</span></div>

In Singapore, that statute is the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1999 Rev ed) (âCAâ). Unlike registered designs and patents, copyright is not a monopoly. It is essentially a negative right to prevent copying. This means that if two identical works were in fact produced independently of one another, there is no infringement of copyright by one of the other (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/11310.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chua Puay Kiang v Singapore Telecommunications Limited [2000] 3 SLR 640</span></a>).</span></div>

Rather, copyright only protects the way in which they are expressed.Â Further, copyright protects the skill, labour and/or judgment used in creating the expression. In particular, copyright subsists in literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works (âworksâ or âa workâ), such as novels, plays, musical compositions, paintings and sculptures, as well as in subject-matter other than the works, such as sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programmes and published editions of works. Additionally, copyright protection is available in respect of live performances and rights management information, such as information identifying the author of a work and the terms and conditions relating to the use of the work.Â </span></div>

Specifically, there is copyright protection in a work as soon as it is expressed or fixed in a material form (e.g. paper, tape and film) from which it is capable of being reproduced. Unlike registered designs, patents and trade marks, there are no formalities required for copyright to subsist and no system of registration of rights. In general, copyright subsists in a work or subject-matter in Singapore if (1) the work or subject-matter was first published or made in Singapore or in a member country of the Berne Convention or the WTO; or (2) the author of the work or the maker of the subject was a citizen or resident of Singapore or of a member country of the Berne Convention or the WTO at the time when the work was first published or made.</span></div>

These acts are intended to strike a fair balance between the interest of copyright owners and the public interest. They include acts (popularly known as âfair dealingsâ) for the purposes of research and study, criticism or review, and reporting current events. To constitute fair dealing for research and study, not more than an article in a periodical or a reasonable proportion of a work (generally, 10% of the pages or a chapter) is to be taken, and the court is also to have regard to such factors as the nature of the work, the amount and substantiality of the part of the work that was copied in relation to the whole work as well as the effect on the potential market. In respect of fair dealing for criticism or review, or for reporting current events, there must also be a sufficient acknowledgement of the work.</span></div>

For instance, the copyright owner can license or assign the right to reproduce his work in a material form to one person and the right to perform the work in public to another person. He can also license or assign the copyright in terms of the whole or part of the copyright period or by geographical area. As a result, there can be a bewilderingly large number of licensees and/or owners of different parts of the copyright in a work.</span></div>

              <div style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">12.1.15<strong>Â Â Â Â </strong>A licence need not be in writing, although it is advisable that it should be so, especially in the case of an exclusive licence (see below). A licence which is not in writing does not bind subsequent assignees of the copyright except a bona fide purchaser for value who does not know of the licence. A licence may be exclusive or non-exclusive. An exclusive licence even excludes the licensor (i.e. the copyright owner) from doing whatever the licence permits â that is, the exclusive licensee is almost the owner of the copyright. Indeed, section 123 of the CA treats an exclusive licensee as the owner for many purposes connected with remedies, as it states that the rights and remedies of an exclusive licence are concurrent with those of the copyright owner.</span></div>
