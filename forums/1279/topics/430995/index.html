              <p>I still wondering the main reason to hand over 172 to tibs( not say i don like).</p>
              <p>is it due tat 172 will have to terminate @ CCK instead of looping @ upp bt timah? (since CCK was under tibs tat time)</p>
              <p>but i rmb tibs shorten the route immediately aft taking over it.. (is it due tat cos BOON LAY under SBS and starting a route from SBS int isnt rite? but cant b cos 927 oso start from SBS CCK int then..</p>
              <p>or is it cos of the routes issue? since 172 will be the only SBS route to ply CCK aft hand over CCK town so SBS hand over everything?(likewise the same scanrio for 171 which was handover together with Bt p'jang svc)</p>
              <p>but i doubt it.. cos SBS 190 still serve bt p'jang tat time despite Bt P'jang under tibs..</p>
              <p>so wat was the main reason????</p>
              <p>if tat was the case svc 66, 157, 174, 174e, 506 shld fall under TIbs ten. strangely, tise 5 svc still under SBS due to their terminating pt.</p>

              <p><br>Yes luckily these 5 services still under SBST and ppl in BB can compare the difference and also u will be seeing UD and crap bendies instead of wright on svc 174. When I was studying in NP, I took svc 172 or svc 174 from jalan anak bukit to BNL int and change 242 to JW st 91.</p>
              <p>I still believe for CCK and BP, SMRT should not be the only sole operator, both SBST and SMRT should operate together. Same applies to punggol and sengkang as SMRT should also operate there...</p>

              Service 172's cutback to terminate at CCK was part of the BP LRT rationalisation. It was also the same day when 172 went under Tibs control.
              <br><br>
              For service 175, Tibs continued to loop along Upp Bt Timah Road since its takeover in Dec 1999. It was only in early 2005 due to some road works at Upp Bt Timah Road which made service 175 amended to loop at Bt Panjang instead. On the same day 175 was renumbered to 975.

              <p>even if 172 still ran the original route to upp bt timah rd, it would still be transfered to TIBS due to the crossing of territory. on the other hand 66 138 157 174 506 was supposed to be transferred to TIBS as well but after further study were given grace to continue its operations under SBS, with restrictions to the amendment of any of the routings within SMRT's territory for the abovementioned services .</p>
