              <p>Something has got to give when every bus trip carries a minimum $0.55 subsidy (including feeder transfers). $4.10 card fare, here we come...</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/need-to-strike-balance-in-transport-cost-burden-khaw-boon-wan/3577594.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/need-to-strike-balance-in-transport-cost-burden-khaw-boon-wan/3577594.html</a></p>
              <p>The Government is also topping up a “huge deficit” under the 
              new Bus Contracting Model, which states that it is now responsible for 
              buying and replacing buses.</p>
              <p>“We pay bus operators a fee to run the bus services. Although fare 
              revenue goes to the Government, it is not enough to cover operating 
              costs,” Mr Khaw said.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>As costs rise over the years, Mr Khaw said fares have not kept
               up and taxpayers have had to subsidise more and more of these operating
               costs.</p>
              <p>“<em>This is clearly not sustainable</em>,” he said. “We must ensure that the fiscal burden does not become too excessive for taxpayers.”</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>But “the PTC cannot always bring good news”, Mr Khaw cautioned, 
              adding that there is also a possibility for an upward fare adjustment.</p>
              <p>“If they do, I hope commuters will be understanding."</p>

              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, nobody asked them to convert to GCM in the first place. </p>
              <p>Since it was their decision to use GCM and now that it is in place, will they still award the seletar bus package tender to other companies who are bidding so much more than Sbs transit? If the govt really does so, means they have no right to increase bus fares as the govt has the money to do so.</p>
              <p>When people badger LTA for Christmas wish list of new bus services, LTA did not really give in. It was mainly the new estates and new roads without any services or less services which got the new bus services. This was again part of the BSEP announced by govt after the 2011 election. Initially is to have 40 new bus services then increase to 80. What the MP at various estates could do was just to fight for the allocation for their residents. That's all. They are not badgering LTA for anything extra. They are only asking for their fair share of the 80 services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>No need to overthink. I am sure you will agree the previous model was even more unsustainable. Higher standards = higher costs = higher fares. You cannot have your cake and eat it. Hard truths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And perhaps the additional costs in awarding to a tender that is not the lowest may be offset by the fact that bidder will likely be less problematic in the future. Look no further than what has happened.</p>

              <p>When people badger LTA for Christmas wish list of new bus
              services, LTA did not really give in. It was mainly the new estates
              and new roads without any services or less services which got the
              new bus services. This was again part of the BSEP announced by govt
              after the 2011 election. Initially is to have 40 new bus services
              then increase to 80. What the MP at various estates could do was
              just to fight for the allocation for their residents. That's all.
              They are not badgering LTA for anything extra. They are only asking
              for their fair share of the 80 services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>They do, they had to ask the right people. Even then, the bus network is still largely a patchwork of new routes. A network revamp (and rationalization) is long overdue to achieve greater efficiency, but that clearly hasn't happened (and isn't happening).</p>
              <p>And it is not limited to bus routes:</p>

              <p>No need to overthink. I am sure you will agree the previous

                      = higher fares. You cannot have your cake and eat it. Hard

              <p>And perhaps the additional costs in awarding to a tender that is
                      not the lowest may be offset by the fact that bidder will likely be
                      less problematic in the future. Look no further than what has

              <p>Someone in the industry once told me this: "Singaporeans pay 60 cent bus fare, but expect to receive SIA first class <span class="st">Solitaire PPS </span>service. How?"</p>
              <p>I know it might score bonus points for an operator bidding for the next tender, but I am not willing to pay 10 cents extra per trip so as to smell some designer aroma on the bus. This is public transport.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, this seems a possible way but then for me, I will not advocate such a reason. We need to think for the poor in Singapore. Buses is a form of transport that you see all sorts of people take. We cannot ostracize and divide time slots into those who can afford it and those who cannot. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>LTA should have kept the fares the same instead of decreasing and getting into this mess. If fares are kept the same now, then no need massive fare increase in future.</p>

              <p>Our transport ministers all CMI lah. First, Mah Bow Tan single-handedly destroyed Tibs Holdings in 1999 with the NEL Tender going to Delgro (SBS). Then Yeo Cheow Tong failed to improve the bus service network in his own ward. Rot in our train system set in during the later years of Raymond Lim's tenure, reaching its peak in 2015 when Lui Tuck Yew was helming the Transport portfolio.</p>
              <p>If our cabinet ministers took one zero off their annual salary we could be seeing better and more affordable bus services. Maybe even $8 heart bypass surgeries for all.</p>
              <p>But 70% voted to retain this lot in power, as Gekpohboy says. Hope that figure drops to 45% in 2020.</p>
