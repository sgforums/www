              <p>"With the Government taking ownership of bus and rail assets and 
              stepping up efforts to ramp up services, the burden of subsidising 
              public transport has effectively shifted to the taxpayer.</p>
              <p>PTC chairman Richard Magnus hinted at the possibility of a fare 
              increase in his blog post yesterday. "Service improvements come at a 
              cost," he said."</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/review-public-transport-fare-adjustment-formula-and-mechanism-underway-ptc">http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/review-public-transport-fare-adjustment-formula-and-mechanism-underway-ptc</a></p>
              <p>"Linking the costs explicitly to the real costs of providing world-class 
              transport would give commuters transparency on system costs and 
              subsidies, and show them that improvements are “not free”.</p>
              <p>Dr Theseira suggested tweaking the formula by incorporating 
              new variables, such as real long-run operating costs. Such costs could 
              include the capital investments in MRT lines and refurbishments, as well
               as in bus depots and buses, and the changes in operating costs 
              resulting from offering a greater quantity and quality of services."</p>

                          <p>The Land Transport Authority said that the two-year contracts of these four routes (653, 655, 656, 657) already expired earlier this year. When the authority opened a new tender, they realised that "the bids from private bus operators are not worth the money", thus decided not to award the contracts.</p>
                          
                          <p><strong>The Land Transport Authority then asked SMRT and SBS Transit if they are interested to take over the operations of these bus routes. The two operators agreed to absorb these routes into their existing bus contracts.</strong> The Land Transport Authority would pay the service fee (to SMRT and SBS Transit) based on the mileage of the respective bus routes.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Sorry for the spam. Just wanted to share an article about the transfer of city direct bus services to SMRT and SBS Transit, which also revealed how the service fees are derived.</p>
                          
              <p>In short,</p>
              <p>1. For public routes, only the mileage is paid.</p>
              <p>2. Express bus routes are supposed to be profitable.</p>
              <p>3. The transfer was requested by LTA.</p>
