                  <p>I'm still waiting for an opposition party to raise awareness of the "skills future" courses, about how redundant the courses actually are (eg. courses on how to arrange flowers, how to clean the house, etcetera.)</p>

              <p>Reason for this is the flaw in the ministers' pay structure in Singapore..</p>
              <p>When you pay your workers a high basic salary it becomes a system that punishes for mistakes rather than encourage for improvement. This means that ministers are just going to become comfortable in their positions and do no more than whatever they are assigned I.e. Lim kopi and sign documents..</p>
              <p>Conversely if a low starting pay is introduced, but with many bonuses and raises in store for good progress, it creates the drive for ministers to really do more and take the risks, since a reward is now up for grabs..</p>
              <p>Why would they even bother if the "reward" is alr paid to them as part of their starting salary?</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the point I am trying to bring across all the while is that when planning a bus route, the importance of providing a service to a part of a road is more important than the loading of a service. This is essentially what the authorities have always emphasized on previously. To put it simply, 'loading' is the last concern for a bus service implementation. </p>
              <p>What was actually noted at that time was lousy policy implementation which makes BSEP suddenly a scheme to placate the voters after GE2011 due to insufficient housing and insufficient public transport. With or without BSEP, transport fares will increase. It was merely used as an important tool for all to see the effects. Now it becomes a very good excuse to increase fares after people witness new services coming in. So when loading for a bus service has more or less people, it does not matter. They will still increase fares as a whole to support this BSEP scheme. </p>
              <p>Even if your (2) and (3) and (4) are made right in your context, fares will still increase. This gonna shows loading and right capacity plays no part in bus fare increases. This only shows they still have to improve their functions and deployments abilities. Let's all don't be too naive to think that they will not increase fares if they can settle (2), (3), (4). Once BSEP and GCM scheme is kicked off, the scheme alone costs money. They are very clever in letting you feel the good effects first before charging you extra. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I partially agree. You need new services to connect newer areas/developments where there is no bus service and you need to provide one irrespective of loading.</p>
              <p>117 is a good route, but didn't justify DDs from the beginning. 46 route could have been planned better and def. didn't need DDs. These are total waste of resources. Likewise the DDs on 83/85/119. </p>
              <p>Introduction of poorly planned routes and random addition of buses just to make people feel good?</p>

              <p>All this costs money and if the fares would increase by 5 cents, now they will increase by 50 cents. It will impact somewhere. Let's not be bullish that this will not lead to higher fare increase and more inconvenience to the poor.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the point I am trying to bring across all the
              while is that when planning a bus route, the importance of
              providing a service to a part of a road is more important than the
              loading of a service. This is essentially what the authorities have
              always emphasized on previously. To put it simply, 'loading' is the
              last concern for a bus service implementation. </p>
              <p>What was actually noted at that time was lousy policy
              implementation which makes BSEP suddenly a scheme to placate the
              voters after GE2011 due to insufficient housing and insufficient
              public transport. With or without BSEP, transport fares will
              increase. It was merely used as an important tool for all to see
              the effects. Now it becomes a very good excuse to increase fares
              after people witness new services coming in. So when loading for a
              bus service has more or less people, it does not matter. They will
              still increase fares as a whole to support this BSEP
              scheme. </p>
              <p>Even if your (2) and (3) and (4) are made right in your context,
              fares will still increase. This gonna shows loading and right
              capacity plays no part in bus fare increases. This only shows they
              still have to improve their functions and deployments abilities.
              Let's all don't be too naive to think that they will not increase
              fares if they can settle (2), (3), (4). Once BSEP and GCM scheme is
              kicked off, the scheme alone costs money. They are very clever in
              letting you feel the good effects first before charging you extra.
              Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Loading is definitely a consideration. Bus routes with consistent poor loading don't give the government revenue to break-even and it is their responsibility to see what can be done about it. Merely improving functions and deployments (such as DD &gt; SD downgrades) are not enough to lower costs to such an extent that the government no longer needs to raise fares. As mentioned earlier, the bus network is a patchwork of routes. In the long term, nation-wide bus rationalization exercise is needed. Even that may not eliminate the need to raise fares, although it will likely increase route and network efficiency if done right. Routes planned by LTA are different to the types of routes SBS, TIBS and SMRT planned back then due to different ideologies.</p>
              <p>With GCM, it is inevitable that fares would be raised, with the financial picture much clearer. Those who are poor or in poverty would likely receive more transport subsidies but the rest of commuters who can afford it will have to pay their share. </p>
              <p>When they say the system is not financially sustainable, they are not saying it for fun or to collect more money from us (even though they say there is nothing wrong with collecting more money). GCM is a much better model than the previous model, but without increased fares and other improvements, the threat of financial ruin is no longer mere scaremongering.</p>

              <p>The NEL rationalisation is brutal. There is no circle line rationalisation because the line is more of a huge looping direction without a very clear impact to the current services at that time. At that time, not much introduction of services too. </p>

              <p>Certainly the loading of bus services will drop even more especially when time goes by.

              <p>Up to now, they have not even done any withdrawal of services (as of recent years).

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, need to balance out priorities at times. If a route is really unprofitable but is the only bus service to a certain area, we should not take out.</p>
              <p>In a GCM contract awarded, there will definitely be some heavily utilized routes and some money losing routes. One will have to cover for the other. We cannot just take out routes which do not make money and eat into the bus companies margin of profit since they have already taken a fixed sum of money from the govt. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I partially agree. You need new services to connect newer
                      areas/developments where there is no bus service and you need to
                      provide one irrespective of loading.</p>
              <p>117 is a good route, but didn't justify DDs from the beginning.
                      46 route could have been planned better and def. didn't need DDs.
                      These are total waste of resources. Likewise the DDs on
                      83/85/119. </p>
              <p>Introduction of poorly planned routes and random addition of
                      buses just to make people feel good?</p>
              <p>Still keep loss making routes running with very low pax because
                      you don't want to take the right steps? </p>
              <p>All this costs money and if the fares would increase by 5 cents,
                      now they will increase by 50 cents. It will impact somewhere. Let's
                      not be bullish that this will not lead to higher fare increase and
                      more inconvenience to the poor.</p>
              <p>Unless the government will continue to fund the deficit and this
                      in turn is whose money? Is it well spent? </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, what constitutes a poorly planned route? Each bus service when introduced, has its main objectives. Just because it does not equate the 'bus fanatics' idea of good loading makes it a poorly planned route??? Note some routes like 116 when just introduced has super poor loading. After two years, it has its own crowd loading which is single deck worthy. You term it as poorly planned route but LTA terms it as a success over time.</p>
              <p>Why you think 46 could have been better planned? You consider poorly planned route? I understand loading is poor. So you earmark it as poorly planned. When they introduce a service to that area, they think that it could have snatched a viable crowd but it did not. It can equate to poor foresight. Planning is always something that is subjective. By the way, 46 brought some of my friends to the famous bedok 85 hawker centre which we are grateful for it. 46 connects many other stops of interest but just cannot get many crowds at this moment.</p>
              <p>BSEP services means having the buses to support extra services. Many other bus services frequency have been increased through adding of buses. It is not random pick and give. It is consider current frequency and checking out the viability. Not random addition just to make you feel good. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>43M is to supplement 43 from Serangoon MRT towards Punggol should the latter stuck in jams..Its the passengers that complained to the authorities regarding this years back</p>
