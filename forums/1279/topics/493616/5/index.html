              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, I understand. I also have another meaning inside my earlier sentences that even if they have data, the actual possibility of implementing it is nowhere a possibility. The complete overhaul is made all the more difficult because the network of buses implemented already for 40 over years is already entrenched. Not easy to touch. Moreover there is also the willingness and the boldness of the mindset. It seems to me they will only continue whatever was already done to proceed to do minor adjustments. Nevertheless, it has been good discussing all these with you guys on this topic. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>You sure people like to make multiple transfers? It's a chore, and it adds to the travel time.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>Anyway, I know in America, bus routes run along common sectors, and as much as possible, the network consists of many t-shapes and straight lines, instead of bus lines all over the place. The purpose is to increase frequency and optimise resources.</p>
              
              <p>In Singapore, we can find such networks at Orchard Road, Jurong West Avenue 1, Bukit Timah Road and Bedok Reservoir Road - in fact that's how our bus routes are planned, right?</p>

              <p>Here's why it's penitious to use the failure of NEL
              rationalisation as the reason to not launch any more
              rationalisation plans. </p>
              <p>The problem with NEL rationalisation lies not with the
              rationalisation itself, but how it is carried out. By this I
              EXPLICITLY mean the routes that were being cut. </p>
              <p>501 was chopped. 502 was chopped. All the peak period services,
              vital to relieve the currently overflowing crowds on the NEL, also
              got chopped. Even 81 and 111 are not spared. Basically the
              Northeast has nothing out to the city save for 80 and 107, both
              which are not meant for use to the city anyway. The Northeast is
              also effectively disconnected from the west in express bus
              connections. </p>
              <p>This is why in times of breakdown, becoming more often as the
              system ages, the Northeast is thrown into a COMPLETE disaster. The
              shuttle effectively becomes the only viable alternative. Personally
              i feel the NEL performs the worst of all lines in terms of crowd
              management because of this. </p>
              <p>Inadequate planning should not be used as a reason to denounce a
              concept as a whole. Bus rationalisation, if optimised, can be an
              essential tool to ensure the relevance of bus services in Singapore
              and maximise benefits for both the operators and the
              commuters. </p>
              <p>It is plain misfortune that the NEL rationalisation has failed
              to achieve any of these outcomes. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, rationalization should be approahced with the mindset of making the network more seamless and to improve efficiency and connectivity, not the mindset of merely reducing duplication and cutting off seemingly redundant routes.</p>

              <p>I personally feel that it is absurd to introduce short trains
              like these. CCL understandable since it was planned long long ago.
              But wtf were they thinking with the DTL and TEL?!</p>
              <p>Clearly these are services that will have high catchment, and
              will even serve as TRUNK lines for some sectors. Simultaneously
              they kept harping on the white paper and whatever "car-free
              nation". No matter how many trains you inject the system will max
              out eventually. So spamming the line with trains is clearly not a
              solution. I think that it is irony at its best. LTA clearly has no

              <p>The main excuse is they can always add more trains but as you said, there is a limit. There is also no way they can add on more train cars onto individual trains after they max out the number of trains, in order to increase capacity, due to the lack of longer platforms as provisions.</p>
              <p>The decision to have 3-car DTL trains and 4-car TEL trains with absolutely no privsions is a failure on many levels - one that may bite us in the long-term.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, actually I think we cannot use Bukit panjang ITH as a yardstick for gauging. It was already conceived before the BSEP implementation. So by then, they have already no choice but to continue with their plans to build. So now when BSEP is in full swing, many commuters will have realized that it is quite small. We only can use the next ITH as a gauge to see if they have realized that big interchanges of  higher capacity are needed. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, actually I think we cannot use Bukit panjang ITH
              as a yardstick for gauging. It was already conceived before the
              BSEP implementation. So by then, they have already no choice but to
              continue with their plans to build. So now when BSEP is in full
              swing, many commuters will have realized that it is quite small. We
              only can use the next ITH as a gauge to see if they have realized
              that big interchanges of  higher capacity are needed. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>I partly agree - but it is not impossible back then to make provisions for an increasing population and an increasing number of bus routes. These are all long term plans. In long-term planning, I'm sure they would have access to the relevant forecasts.</p>
              <p>Or perhaps what has happened has exceeded all forecasts and predictions and now the planners have another few hundreds of headaches.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, I think yishun ITH will serve as a better yardstick for measurement. It will be keenly watched and we will be more concerned as to the no of parking lots, no of bus services, layout, ease of flow of human traffic around interchange, ease of flow of traffic at the immediate roads leading up to interchange, ease of access for bus services (which services to be arranged at which berth), etc. Cheers.
