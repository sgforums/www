              These complain kings and queens can never shut up whether BCM or no BCM. They want good, cheap, if possible everything free. They think the world owed them a living, even lord shiva, tua pek kongs, angels, etc.. also owe them. I once ask how and who is going pay if everything is peanuts or free. His reply : tax the car owners and rich people. So simple ah? Retarded moron.

              <p>I personally feel that it is absurd to introduce short trains like these. CCL understandable since it was planned long long ago. But wtf were they thinking with the DTL and TEL?!</p>
              <p>Clearly these are services that will have high catchment, and will even serve as TRUNK lines for some sectors. Simultaneously they kept harping on the white paper and whatever "car-free nation". No matter how many trains you inject the system will max out eventually. So spamming the line with trains is clearly not a solution. I think that it is irony at its best. LTA clearly has no bloody idea what it wants to achieve. </p>

              <p>but, honestly, ever since they add new trains to the NEL, I feel that the trains are less cramp, in fact just nice only can enter the train during peak hours.</p>
                          <p>the NEL rationalisation is obviously to benefit SBS Transit, since they were able to edit bus routes then.</p>
                          <p>maybe it's because of the overwhelming demand in the North-East region that the LTA has been introducing many city direct bus services at Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol.</p>
                          <p>but as the North-East region develops, it's better to have another MRT line eventually. That is why we have the Cross Island Line. But for now, it's better to have more trunk routes or express routes to connect the North East region to the city centre.</p>

              <p>To be honest, the concession pass for adult is just for show. The concession pass is $120, when one month we only spend up to $102.48 on public transport (if we travel every day). Without the pass is cheaper.</p>
                      <p>Unless they set the price at $70 or below. But unlikely they will, cuz otherwise, the fares would be even more unsustainable.</p>

              <p>Even the one for NS men ($85) I don't think it's worth buying, cuz, it's not as if NS men take public transport everyday.</p>
                      <p>The only concession pass worth buying are the ones for primary school, secondary school and JC/Poly/ITE. Because understandably, the parents are the ones paying for the students to take public transport. It's better to help the parents subside the cost of raising a child.</p>

              <p>I was one of those who keep complaining about 3-car trains on
                  DTL long time ago, but I have to admit that DTL is still much
                  less crowded than other lines (even CCL). But when DTL3 opens,

              <p>DTL3 is precisely what I'm talking about. See, its ridiculous to plan such long lines and expect short trains to tank the load. The outcomes in many instances have been proven to be disastrous. </p>
              <p>If DTL2 and DTL3 are really going to have such vast loading differences they shouldn't have been joined up tgt in the first place. Anyway a long line is going to be eventually the worst hit in times of an electrical or signal failure. </p>

                  <p>Good plan. Now that there is (supposedly) no pressure to recoup costs, we can launch these services at an attractive express fare of around $2. But we can't keep adding buses to our fleet and clog up the roads. Will planners be able to wthdraw routes at the same time? Reduce the headway of feeder services according to market demand should people switch to express buses in a big way? There needs an overhaul of the bus service network, and people need to understand that there are always alternatives to every bus service withdrawal and amendment. If not, the bus network will look more and more like a patchwork of new services atop existing ones.</p>
