SBS service 197 never turns up one. i cna die waiting for it. but TIBS963 is good and everyday without fail i see the bus.<br><br>SBS rat hole is NEL...poor ridership...cause of many withdrawls of buses...... 9see my sign offs)<br><br>TIBS withdrew 989. bad move.<br><br>conclusion:<br>TIBS rocks, SBS down in the rocks<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In addition, SBST good buses are the mark 2. mark 4 , VO 2/3 axles and VSO and mercedes. ScaniaN113CRB I used to hate them, but now I dont mind them but I still dont like them. LO 3 axles is the worst bus in SBST's fleet.<br><br>TIBS ? I only like the habit and volgren bendy.

They deploy LO3-Ax on svc 97 at a high freq of &lt;5mins per bus twds Jurong East, while i have to wait like 35mins tdy for 971E tdy and try to stuff myself into the bus cos an ELBO earlier skipped the bus stop as it was full!!!

Curse TIBS for destroying a money maker in their own hands.<br>They actually deploy the bendies at 4+ and 6+ passing thru AYE twds WRI, where the load is not as high as compared to 5+!!! Where Alexandra workers and NUS students and ITE dover students knock off!<br></div>

Even svc 852 almost got axed, but luckily some kind soul petitioned to TIBS in the papers to keep it.<br><br>This sore thing will pass soon enough.
