While affected GCM routes were transferred to exchange those current bus routes deployed under GCM with non-BSEP ones from various depot and transfer them to AMDEP/BRBP, HGDEP, BNDEP/CGBP.

              <p>basically is most of the BSEP buses such as those buses
              registers earlier back in 2012 and 2013 for Tower Transit from
              various depots in Singapore, they are AMDEP/BRBP, HGDEP, BNDEP/CGBP
              were transferred to SLBP. While affected GCM routes were
              transferred to exchange those current bus routes deployed under GCM
              with non-BSEP ones from various depot and transfer them to
              AMDEP/BRBP, HGDEP, BNDEP/CGBP. So I made numerous changes in
              Sgwiki.</p>

              <p>okay let's take 6383G's case. where did you get the info that
                  this bus has been transferred? did you saw the bus? or did you see
                  anyone's post(in Cameo spotting or wherever? or did you just assume

              <p>That is the thing... So I never see and I just anyhow put those buses for CGM ones. Then I just simply put those buses with the lowest regiatration number (BSEP registered ones) and send them to SLBP for Tower Transit. Next time, must go to the roads for services and see bus regiatration carefully, then can state.</p>

              <p>That is the good question, Mr SBS 9256 X... SBS8441J was being transferred to AMDEP from SLBP 143 earlier this year, so I guess SBS6383G might be in SLBP 143 which swapped with 8441 for GCM. And also for example, even the higher BSEP registered SBS6394A, SBS6395Y, SBS6396U were transferred out from HGDEP 141 to BBDEP 96 for GCM later this year.</p>
