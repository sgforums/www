              <p>The cameo capacity downgrades are really irritating.</p>
              <p>Passengers usually cannot board the cameo-downgraded bus, and the BC often has to shout 'Please move in'. This also causes the bus to be delayed.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the BC for the cameo downgraded SD rushes to hide behind the DD in front, and the waiting time becomes ridiculous.</p>
              <p>SBST should also get rid of the 50 DM3500s at once!</p>
              <p>For SMRT, they should take in some Wrights.</p>
