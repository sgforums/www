              <p>This evening I boarded SBST48 near Sim Lim Square. There was a terrible jam and I reached HV 90 minutes later.</p>
              <p>The bus was caught jammed all the way from Rochor to Farrer Road, and I believe many passengers would be waiting for that bus service. To my surprise, the bus drive on the right lanes, skipped all the bus stops (the bus still fairly empty), and no passengers were flagging for that bus while approaching at bus stops.</p>
              <p>The bus arrived at HV, and I alighted, I realised that the bus panel (at the head of the bus) display 'OFFSERVICE'.</p>
              <p>I am very surprised, though the bus was caught in the jam, I didn't feel too bad.</p>
              <p>Since when SBST has started such practice? I am impressed.</p>

              <p>Maybe there was a jam earlier on that affected the bus timings.... <br><br>All arrived at the same time and a new temporary timetable was planned for that day, delaying all bus services on 48. <br><br>Why should the bus driver apologise to you. It was the traffic that resulted in the change in bus timings. Not his fault.</p>

              <p><br>Drivers need to eat at Buona Vista Terminal. Add on to probably 1 peak hour bus going off service.. you get 40min. This is on top of the heavy traffic conditions on the previous trip.</p>
              <p>The timekeeper cannot cut the mealbreak for drivers and its a mandatory requirement - minimum 20min.</p>

              <p>I must complement SBS Transit to implement such initiatives. How I wish SMRT has taken similar steps as well.</p>
              <p>Waiting for SMRT 106 especially in the morning can be frustrating at times. Sometimes both 106 bendies arrive, the first was packed like sardines, and the second still have few seats available. It drives me mad when the first bus continue to stop and pick up passengers whilst the second bus continue to tail the first bus! That's bad!</p>

              <p>The other day at 7.10pm, I was at the first bus stop for the bus 48 (after coming out straight from the interchange) waiting for the bus coming out. As I just saw one 48 going off, i thought the most I would wait for the next one would be 15-20 minutes later.</p>
              <p>In the end, the bus only came at 7.50pm. It took me 40 minutes to wait for the bus 48 coming right out from the interchange. There is NO jam, NO shortage of bus 48 buses parking at the interchange.</p>
              <p>I was damn pissed off!!! 40 minutes for the bus to drive out from the interchange.</p>
              <p>Does anyone know where can I make a complain to SBS? I am seriously damn pissed off at the moment, and the bus driver also never apologise or wat. Damn angry..</p>
              <p><br>Where to make a complain?? Do let me know please</p>
