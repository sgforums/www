              <p>This evening I boarded SBST48 near Sim Lim Square. There was a terrible jam and I reached HV 90 minutes later.</p>
              <p>The bus was caught jammed all the way from Rochor to Farrer Road, and I believe many passengers would be waiting for that bus service. To my surprise, the bus drive on the right lanes, skipped all the bus stops (the bus still fairly empty), and no passengers were flagging for that bus while approaching at bus stops.</p>
              <p>The bus arrived at HV, and I alighted, I realised that the bus panel (at the head of the bus) display 'OFFSERVICE'.</p>
              <p>I am very surprised, though the bus was caught in the jam, I didn't feel too bad.</p>
              <p>Since when SBST has started such practice? I am impressed.</p>

              <p>this step is called fan pai. bus captain is very late from schedule and there are other buses behind it to be able to pick more people. this is done so that Bus Captains can return to the Interchange quickly after a terrible jam. also used if a bus is facing a technical issue but still possible to continue driving. </p>
              <p>last weekend i spotted more than 25 buses plying chinatown and clemenceau (thaipusam) - heavy jams. buses were either with EDS switched off or switched to off service. to flipped or removed destos but with passengers onboard. service 2 was one of the biggest culprits. every 1 out of 4 buses flipped desto / changed EDS after bugis. </p>

              <p><br>Yup, I agree that this is a very, very good practice.</p>
              <p>They can only 'fan pai' only upon receiving instruction from 'HQ'? If 2 buses of same service number arrives at same time, can the first bus initiate 'fan pai'?</p>
              <p>I had seen many times especially in the morning, 2 'SMRT106' bendies arriving at same time, the first bendy was packed like sardines, whilst the second bendy still has many empty seats. Unfortunately the first bendy continue to pick passengers, and the second bendy continues to tail right behind. That's can be very frustrating for passengers on either bus. Hope the bus captains were empowered to 'fan pai' themselves.</p>

              <p>This is really what irritate me in SGFbuses. When someone make a
              light comment, please accept it. Dun nid to snowball into a flame
              war. Plus my comment is just a note and it does not mean i hate or
              dislike or anyway dishonour AEW statement. Your act is what this
              forum's Achilles hill- that is unable to accept some other
              view. Remember a forum is a place for discussion, any body have the
              right to place any comment here and the role of forum mates is that
              to add on constructive feedback, i believe mine is definitely
              constructive . I had noticed that many of you comment on bus photos
              like they are professional photographic forum, plus correct some
              other views in such a sarcastic manner. Enough said. This is
              why my post count here is going less and less as i am so irritated
              . have you noticed why i really loved posting at GCA as there is
              liberal not like here.</p>

              <p>This is a perfect example of pedantry.<br><br>There is no real need correcting people for using the word <em>interchange</em> instead of <em>terminal</em> or vice versa.<br><br>All we want is not for people to be pedantic or spelling, grammar and punctuation nazis. It adds too little value to the forums and potentially a negative threat to the climate of the forums.<br><br>It might seem that I am, myself, being pedantic at your pedantry, but I think there might be some advice in my post that brings a potentially positive value to the forums.<br><br>Thank you and have a good day, even though it is forecasted to rain over most of Singapore.</p>
