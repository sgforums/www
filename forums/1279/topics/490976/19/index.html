              <p>As in the rationale to extend it? I find it surprising that it extend this trunk. for 83 i can understand how it serve as a "feeder" but 33 is vry obvious a trunk. Like what makes this service so special that it needs an extension of service hours?</p>

              <p>33 helps to act as alternative to the MRT services to bring people home from the city center. If you notice, in this select group of services there is also svc 133, serving the same purpose.</p>
              <p>Previously svcs 2, 12, 97 were also in this select group, however after handing over to GAS and TT they no longer have extended operating hours during eves of festive holidays ...</p>

              <p>Still dare to say 14, 74, 166, 196 ah? Real joker sia. These buses are not extended at all. Really anyhow leh.</p>
              <p>33 timing is extended at Kent ridge terminal. Obviously for Dover road. When I reply to CZT, I am considering the west terminal, not east.</p>
              <p>33 timing is also extended at bedok interchange. Then that is for your MRT connection la. Please take note 33 both end timings are extended. For west end, purpose is no longer to connect to MRT la. Cheers. Thanks.Â </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, if you don't know, please don't anyhow say
              anything la. Last bus timing does not have to be for MRT
              la.Â </p>
              <p>Still dare to say 14, 74, 166, 196 ah? Real joker sia. These
              buses are not extended at all. Really anyhow leh.</p>
              <p>33 timing is extended at Kent ridge terminal. Obviously for
              Dover road. When I reply to CZT, I am considering the west
              terminal, not east.</p>
              <p>33 timing is also extended at bedok interchange. Then that is
              for your MRT connection la. Please take note 33 both end timings
              are extended. For west end, purpose is no longer to connect to MRT
              la. Cheers. Thanks.Â </p>

              <p>As in the rationale to extend it? I find it surprising that it

              "feeder" but 33 is vry obvious a trunk. Like what makes this

              <p>As I pointed out in my earlier posts, it's not 100% accurate to say that only feeder services (and pseudo-feeder services like 51A, 60A, 63M etc) have their operating hours extended. Select TRUNK services (such as svcs 2, 12, 33, 97, 133) have in the past had their operating hours extended on select eves of public holidays (most notably, New Year's Day). Reason I have stated earlier, and now shall directly quote from one of SBST's press releases:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2013-12-30-01.aspx">From SBST</a></p>
              <p>To complement the extension of the train operating hours, SBS Transit 
                  will be extending the operating hours of another five more bus services -
                   2, 12, 33, 97 and 133 - at their respective bus interchanges on the eve
                   of New Year, Tuesday, 31 December 2013.</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, this means previously it is bus companies make the decisions in previous years. However for now, decision made by LTA or still up to individual bus companies? If decision is by LTA, it should still have been 2, 12, 33, 97, 133. So I believe decision is still by each bus company. Sbs transit basically sticks to the same old services all along. Cheers.

              <p>Yup I think the decision to run these extra late night trips are probably made by the individual companies (at least previously, pre-GCM). Right now the extra trips on svcs 33 and 133 might be a form of goodwill by SBST to provide convenience for people celebrating the new year in the city, who knows whether next year these services (33, 133) will once again have their operating hours extended?</p>
              <p>IMO it would be good to continue operating svcs 33, 133 late into the night since they cover many places not directly accessible by MRT. While SBST will probably not get paid extra for running these extra trips, I hope that LTA at least allows SBST to continue running these extra late night trips for the benefit of the population ...</p>
