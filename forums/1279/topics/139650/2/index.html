No new buses have been purchased. The habits were bought a few months before the merger. Only 4 new services were introduced since the merger wheras tibs would introduce new services frequently in the 90s When they just merged, they still functioned as different companies but under a arent company. But in 2002, they merged their backroom resources. So, the change you see is a slow process, not an immediate process.</div>

No new buses have been purchased. The habits were bought a few months before the merger. Only 4 new services were introduced since the merger wheras tibs would introduce new services frequently in the 90s When they just merged, they still functioned as different companies but under a arent company. But in 2002, they merged their backroom resources. So, the change you see is a slow process, not an immediate process.</div></blockquote>Of course i noticed...i been livin in SMRT area for 5yrs ma..i hve no complains for BB...but BP, CCK, Yew Tee....Woodlands oso needs to be looked into..<br><br>i suggested 178 to ply Yew Tee n 966 to ply underserved BP area...but they reply saying got no plans for changes...they myt consider the idea only on their next review...but i doubt so...</div>

The sector swap may not even have occurred at all.</div></blockquote>Yes, they should. Or rather SMRT buses can be merged with SBS Transit &amp; SBS Transit 's NEL hand over to SMRT. This will solve the complexness between the two company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about SMRT Buses website...<br><br>The website is horrible, espacially the "What's New" section. They did'nt update that section since may 2004, and you cannot view the archieves news. If I want to view the news, I MUST install Acrobat PDF Reader, because I need that to view the news. SBS Transit 's Website is the best, with alot of information and the "Press Release" section is the best of all, frequent and latest update and I can view the past update back all the way to 2003.</div>
