              <p>My first post here! :)</p>
              <p>I've encountered this problem in my 6 years encounter with service 119 servicing Sengkang and loops at Hougang St 21 Old Bus Interchange. Especially towards the Sengkang direction during weekdays at around 6 to 7am, the buses are normally packed to the door as it passes by many schools on the way like SRJC, HIHS and CHIJ. But the funny thing is that almost all the time, it comes in single-decks, thus causing many to miss their bus to school. In addition, the long waiting time for service 119 just worsened this problem.</p>
              <p>However, I've noticed that during the non-peak hours from 10am to about 4pm, many 119s come in DD, and it's practically empty except for the driver. Why is that so?</p>
              <p>PS. sry if this has already been posted here. If so, pls link me there. Thx.</p>

              <p>I hope this explanation will help you. lol</p>
              <p>Before Sv 578 was introduced and one of the 119 bus was used for the X-over, the structure was like this:</p>
              <p>1A/5P&gt; SBS2781S<br>2A/6P&gt; SBS9298A(DD)<br>3A/7P&gt; SBS9501M(DD)<br>4A/8P&gt; SBS2688D<br>9S&gt; SBS9662G(DD)<br>10E&gt; SBS593G</p>
              <p>When the service start operation at 0530, the first round for 1A to 3A will not have many people taking the bus, the crowd start to come in from 9S(fourth bus), 4A, 10E onwards..... The frequency will be around 11-13mins. After 0830 hrs, the no. of buses dropped to 5 buses as 10E will go back to depot. After 1030 hrs, the no. of buses dropped to 4 buses as 9S will go back to depot. At around 1130-1200hrs, the no. of buses will increase to 5 buses as 10E come back. At around 1530 hrs, the no. of buses will increase to 6 buses as 9S come back. At around 1850hrs, the no. of buses will drop to 5 buses as 10E will go back to depot and at around 1930-1940hrs, the no. of buses will drop to 4 buses as 9S will go back to depot.<br><br>From what I experienced, the first round for 10E, second round for 1A,2A,3A,9S and 4A will experience good riderships (during the school peak hours)</p>
              <p>After Sv 578 was introduced, one of the 119 buses is used for the X-over</p>
              <p>1A/4P&gt; SBS593G<br>2A/5P&gt; SBS2688D<br>3A/6P&gt; SBS9298A(DD)<br>7S&gt; SBS9662G(DD)<br>8E&gt; SBS9501M(DD)<br>X-over bus: SBS1977B</p>
              <p>From next week onwards:<br>1A/4P&gt; SBS9298A(DD)<br>2A/5P&gt; SBS593G<br>3A/6P&gt; SBS2688D<br>7S&gt; SBS9501M(DD)<br>8E&gt; SBS9662G(DD)<br>X-over bus: SBS1977B<br><br>When the service start operation from 0530 during weekdays, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1A will start first followed by 2A, 7S, the X-over bus, 3A and finally 8E.</span> After around 0830hrs, the number of buses will drop to 5 buses as 8E go back to depot. At around 1000+hrs, the no. of buses will drop to 4 buses as the X-over bus will do Sv 578. At around 1130hrs, the no. of buses will stay at 4, as 7S will go back to depot and 8E will come back. At around 1500+hrs, the no. of buses will increase to 5 buses as 7S come back. At around 1730 hrs, the no. of buses will increase to 6 buses as the X-over bus will come back and do on Sv 119. At around 1830-1850 hrs, the no. of buses will decrease to 5 buses as 8E will go back to depot. At around 1930 hrs, the no. of buses will decrease to 4 buses as 7S will go back to depot.</p>

              <p>I never check the e-timetables. Sometimes I will peep at the timesheet, if not will monitor.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>i will say that the case is same for 64 and 93</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>both services need double decks during peak then when off peak, not a single passgenger is seen on the double deck services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact sbs transit could use these buses as crossover on high demand premium services in the future. like for example the 64 DD can serve 64 in morning peak then go off to do premium 582 a new premium service yet to come by sbs transit...super high demand uh.. cck  north to prchard lol</p>
