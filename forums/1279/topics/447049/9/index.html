              <p>You might be surprised that both the Scania K230UB and Citaro actually costs the same at about 360k each, despite the large orders of the K230UB and shipping in of the Citaros. And the MAN A22 costs slightly lesser at 325k each.</p>
              <p>Figures are from announced press releases.</p>
              <p>However, we what we do not know is the operating costs (includes fuel consumption, maintenance and servicing, repairs, etc) of each of the types. This can add up to a rather significant amount in 17/19 years.</p>

              <p>As mentioned previously, unless someone works in sbst office, we wont know the exact reason why the citaro was not preferred in earlier rounds. But in fact, we must not forget that C&amp;C only offered the more expensive OC500LE as a competing vehicle during the 2007-2009 period. This would lead sbst to rejecting the trial even, as the 12lit engine was more likely to be using more fuel than the 9lit on the k230ub, and also costing more in upfront purchase price.</p>
              <p>I would still keep my stand, that sbst had no choice in 2010 but to order a fully built up vehicle. This is based on theÂ chronological order of events that occured, in which the assembly of the wrights being the most significant factor.</p>

              even, as the 12lit engine was more likely to be using more fuel
              than the 9lit on the k230ub, and also costing more in upfront

              <p>I would still keep my stand, that sbst had no choice in 2010 but

              Your assumption regarding the fuel consumption of the K230UB vs. OC 500 LE is incorrect.  Experience in Australia has shown that the K230UB actually consumes as much, if not MORE fuel than the OC 500 LE, particularly in more demanding start-stop traffic and hilly topographies.

              <p>I understand that there are more factors too, but would it be true to say that on a economic viewpoint, the unit price, fuel consumption, and the availability/cost of aftersales support (parts, etc) being the few major areas of consideration in purchasing buses?</p>
              <p>As for DEF, it does not seem to be the reason here as both the operators now operates a mixed fleet consisting of both EGR and SCR vehicles. However, it could be of an issue in smaller fleets as it is not readily available at fuel pumps here.</p>
              <p>Lastly, my opinion would be that both of the operators here tend to neglect the driver's comfort with horribly placed mirrors (way too high up on the OC500LE), tight spaces in driver's cab, glare from glossy plastics, etc.. It's sad to see this, but i guess the job is not as well respected here (compared to australia) for the operators to care.</p>

              <p>In all fairness, the Scania K230UBs are 'adequate' for suburban conditions with flat terrain and longer distances between stops.Â  My only objection is that they use just as much, if not MORE fuel than a Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE under the same conditions, and on top of that, the Merc is more driveable (i.e. the driver doesn't have to use as much throttle to achieve the same result).</p>
