              <p>Dun talk crap please. Because of EGR the power of the bus is reduced, and Euro V having less power than a Euro IV. I guess you have never been on a chionging Citaro before. Shiok max. Check the specifications:</p>

              <li>Transmission: Voith DIWA D854.5 (SBST)</li>
              </ul>
              <div>There's no question about this. The KUBs "enjoy" a jerky acceleration, due to low power imput and the transmission with it. OC500LE runs on 6HP592C but the smoothness is apparent. On any other bus, it's hard to think a KUB accelerating at that speed. Citaro at traffic jam blame what, the bus ah? And how can a KUB fly when it's limited to 60km/h? It can barely attain 5th gear, let alone 6th. KUBs drag race KUBs plainly cause they don't stand a chance against other buses. </div>
              </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Btw KUBs can't chitchat, they're buses. Facts boy, I have never been pressed into my seat on KUB before, other buses it's possible <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></div>

Five cylinders also allows for a shorter block and crankshaft. The engine features two specially designed balancer shafts at the crankshaft to counter the forces generated by the five cylinder firing sequence.

              Citaro at traffic jam blame what, the bus ah? And how can a KUB fly
              when it's limited to 60km/h? It can barely attain 5th gear, let

              <p>What's wrong with turbocharging??</p>
              <p>Without turbocharging, you would sacrifice fuel economy, driveability and the ability to meet current and future emissions legislation.  Practically all buses made from Euro 2-spec onwards have turbocharged engines, and twin-stage turbocharging (with one low pressure turbo and one high pressure turbo) or Variable Geometry Turbochargers becoming commonplace from Euro 5.</p>

              <p>You need to understand the fact that SBST can sometimes be a cheapskate pain in the ass. Buying the same model in large quantities not only standerdises the fleet to an extent (one thing on their minds that time), but also makes overall price of order cheaper. Therefore, cheap bus chassis and engine+cheap bodywork+mass order=huge savings for SBST. See how much savings they will aquire from this junk in the future <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Not a mystery at all... And the Citaro (2nd generation) was introduced in 2005, original in <strong>1997</strong>. You say what again?</p>

              <p>Scanias are good!!! Can take in more passengers than Citaros! Citaros have bad design at the rear, only one line of standing passenge is possible. Not possible to have two rows of standing passenger, as backside will be rubbing with backside or cock rubbing with the sitting passenger!!</p>

              <p>Scanias tend to vibrate overtime, look at the N113s of history, the L113CRLs of SMRT and now the K230UBs.. The Scania K230UB had steps leading to the rear, inconvenient as people may lose their step. This design has been banned for public buses by LTA and only the arrangement of the MANs or the Citaros are allowed. "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; ">Citaros have bad design at the rear, only one line of standing passenge is possible." </span>This is the only possible design possible with operaters now, unless they come out with another innovative design. And sure, Scania engines are long lasting, but use your <span style="color: #ff0000;">bloody</span> sense you want a massive rocking chair or a comfortable bus? The A22s and the Citaro have almost no vibrations when idle. Look at the K230UBs after just 5 years, the Euro Vs just 2 years..</p>
