              <p>Scanias tend to vibrate overtime, look at the N113s of history,
              the L113CRLs of SMRT and now the K230UBs.. The Scania K230UB had
              steps leading to the rear, inconvenient as people may lose their
              step. This design has been banned for public buses by LTA and only
              the arrangement of the MANs or the Citaros are allowed.
              "<span style="color: #333333;">Citaros have
              bad design at the rear, only one line of standing passenge is
              possible." </span>This is the only possible design possible
              with operaters now, unless they come out with another innovative
              design. And sure, Scania engines are long lasting, but use your
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">bloody</span> sense you want a
              massive rocking chair or a comfortable bus? The A22s and the Citaro
              have almost no vibrations when idle. Look at the K230UBs after just
              5 years, the Euro Vs just 2 years..</p>

              <p>Never been on a chionging Citaro but have experience chionging

              <p>Nah. Hard on acceleration doesn't really make much difference, just the ZF howling higher and stuff. Still, a "chionging" KUB should be roughly the average acceleration of a lightly peddled Wright B9TL? Btw, WEG2 B9TLs can really chiong, one BC on 17 really flew just now. Even drag-raced with a van and won LOL. </p>

              <p>No one has never not tried a KUB. I live in the east so it's f inevitable. And ello, Mkiii is 1993. Now is 2012 you still expect 1993 standard?

And the layout of the KUB makes it hard for certain people to climb up stairs at the back. And for tall people risk banging their heads. At least OCs have higher height. And KUB has rough shifts cause of low power, causing bus to jerk. OC500LE uses ZF 6HP (592 instead) but has a smooth gearshift. Care to explain? And Citaro a/c blame EvoBus for defect, though I suspect 2011 Citaro will have a big improvement. ._.</p>

              <p>That's their fault for choosing MIC. Cause it's cheap only. Look at it's toy design. China buses entirely made by them, apart from transmission and occasional the engine. Can't expect much. The only good thing of the Yutong is frankly the gearbox. Which is ZF 6HP602C. Cummins can be quite reliable, though Scanias are ironicaly the ones which last longest before overhaul is needed.</p>

              <p>SBST has never really considered power in their purchase of buses. Its still the same now. Its not like we need the power. The K230UB has little problem going up and down slopes. Even the VO3X can do it without burning to crisp. Having power like the Citaro helps in giving the BC a less stressful drive.</p>
              <p>I dont understand what you mean. I brought in the MKIII to illustrate my point that all types can go fast.....till 60km/h. Are you another gussie?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>That's their fault for choosing MIC. Cause it's cheap only. Look
              at it's toy design. China buses entirely made by them, apart from
              transmission and occasional the engine. Can't expect much. The only
              good thing of the Yutong is frankly the gearbox. Which is ZF
              6HP602C. Cummins can be quite reliable, though Scanias are
              ironicaly the ones which last longest before overhaul is
              needed.</p>

              <p>You must be joking....</p>
              <p>The 113s have the worst depreciation record when you compare against contemporary Volvo and Merc we had.</p>
              <p>And Cummins have had their fair share of engine fires. Remember who started the AMDEP fire? How many Lances have burned down? And the soot! Unbelievable stuff.</p>
              <p>And what's so good about ZF? ZF has the longest list of problems I have encountered. Wait a few more years and you'll see.</p>

              <p>The 113s have the worst depreciation record when you compare
              against contemporary Volvo and Merc we had.</p>
              <p>And Cummins have had their fair share of engine fires. Remember
              who started the AMDEP fire? How many Lances have burned down? And
              the soot! Unbelievable stuff.</p>
              <p>And what's so good about ZF? ZF has the longest list of problems
              I have encountered. Wait a few more years and you'll see.</p>

              <p>Dun give a shit about Cummins already lols, as long as they get MB or Volvo. ZF Ecolife is new ._. not Ecomat. next generation liao. Will wait and see. But parts sooner or later need go overhaul de. Inevitable. But MkIIs still went by 20 years</p>

              <p>SBS876R and SBS877M can do 4th gear at quite low speeds. And this bus different engine de. I think MkIIIs is cause low power then can't go past 60kmh. but they don't have a limitor at 60kmh. maybe higher</p>
