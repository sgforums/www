            <div class='col-md body'>The decision to purchase the 'incorrigible' KUBs has to be one of the worst decisions ever made by SBST. The combination of an underpowered engine, unstable chassis and flimsy bodywork epitomizes the failure of profit-oriented corporate decisions. What many local transport companies in general fail to realize is that a higher initial investment in better vehicles with integral bodywork (e.g. Citaros and MAN Lion City buses) could prove more cost-effective in the long run due to improved fuel economy and more importantly lower maintenance costs, unlike those with custom bodyworks like the CDGE B9TLs. This is especially true for the KUBs since a lot of money must go into solving vibration issues and other nitty-gritty details that are starting to fail, along with howling radiators that are struggling to cool the engine due to poor airflow designs of custom bodyworks. I am extremely saddened by many local transport companies which choose to purchase horrible MIC buses which will definitely return horrible gas mileages and emit unbelievable amounts of exhaust gases, which will then need constant maintenance to meet LTA regulations.</div>

              <p>Scania K230UB can still cope w/ NTU's slope while the ageing LO3x can't... So what it tells? mmm...</p>
              <p>As for the MAN, it can't even carry people after the exit door area.. You try deploying it to airport svs, you see what happens. I lived by the era w/o MRT, I still able to squeeze and alight the bus safely.</p>
              <p>The radiators is something of an old problem... Which is why people will still go for Japanese car than European makes as far as possible.</p>

              <p>No choice. SBST bought the 1100 Scania K230UBs because of the outgoing buses (Volvo MK2s followed by Scania N113CRBs and Merc 0405s).</p>
              <p>SBST should have considered different new bus models then. Finally Citaros were chosen instead of another 300 K230UBs for the MK3 replacements <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  "><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></span></p>

              <p>with population increasing, there will be a need for more that can ferry more ppl in one go. the interior of the citaro and A22 have too many seats, although i must agree they are still more comfortable than kubs.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, that was just a part of a theory set up to make us believe that the WT kub is part of an sbst order. Actual fact is that LTA has not given this requirement, and that the WT kub is manufactured about exactly 1 year after the last sbst kub.</p>

              <p>The decision to purchase the ‘incorrigible’ KUBs has to be one of the worst decisions ever made by <span>SBST</span>. The combination of an underpowered engine, unstable chassis and flimsy bodywork epitomizes the failure of profit-oriented corporate decisions. What many local transport companies in general fail to realize is that a higher initial investment in better vehicles with integral bodywork (e.g. Citaros and <span>MAN</span> Lion City buses) could prove more cost-effective in the long run due to improved fuel economy and more importantly lower maintenance costs, unlike those with custom bodyworks like the <span>CDGE</span> B9TLs. This is especially true for the KUBs since a lot of money must go into solving vibration issues and other nitty-gritty details that are starting to fail, along with howling radiators that are struggling to cool the engine due to poor airflow designs of custom bodyworks. I am extremely saddened by many local transport companies which choose to purchase horrible <span>MIC</span> buses which will definitely return horrible gas mileages and emit unbelievable amounts of exhaust gases, which will then need constant maintenance to meet <span>LTA</span> regulations.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, that was just a part of a theory set up to make
              us believe that the WT kub is part of an sbst order. Actual fact is
              that LTA has not given this requirement, and that the WT kub is

              <p>IMPOSSIBLE! LTA must also be tired of these creepy KUB to ban new registrations! Otherwise SBS would order more K230 instead of Citaros!</p>
