              <p>You might be surprised that both the Scania K230UB and Citaro actually costs the same at about 360k each, despite the large orders of the K230UB and shipping in of the Citaros. And the MAN A22 costs slightly lesser at 325k each.</p>
              <p>Figures are from announced press releases.</p>
              <p>However, we what we do not know is the operating costs (includes fuel consumption, maintenance and servicing, repairs, etc) of each of the types. This can add up to a rather significant amount in 17/19 years.</p>

              <p>I think the K230UB is a ''Alternative Cheaper'' bus to fill in
              the missing buses SBST needed at a cheaper cost. That's why SBST
              brought it in massive amounts. The extra money SBST got left is to
              hire more bus captains because SBST is lacking SBST captains and in
              relative to over 80% of the comments/feedbacks for SBST's BCs is
              about foreigner BCs, SBST is trying to get more Singaporeans to
              join their career. SBST 's Singaporean's joining rate comparing to
              the foreigner's joining rate is huge. We don't want our own country
              to be infested with people that are not of our country. SBST is
              probably wanting the ''originality'' of their own company.<br> <br> And stop having the childish dream of citaros. You go and buy them
              yourselves and do anything to it yourselves. It looks great from
              the outside but the ride is not impressing any of my family
              members. They seemed to be more interested in DM3500s.</p>

              <p>FPT for Citaros are much easier to perform, just plonk out the flap at the rear right and all your engine, transmission, radiator etc levels are all able to be checked and topped up at a single spot. You might wonder why is this important, but often many large commercial vehicle operators dont do FPT thoroughly because it is difficult to do so without dirtying yourself, and thus resulting in expensive repairs or even fires (in the case of leaking radiator coolant and not checked). If you look at it from this perspective, then the Citaro will cost less to run as there will be lesser incidents of damanged components.</p>
              <p>The reason why SMRT bought 200 MAN instead of 200 Citaros is due to SBST taking up the order queue. If SMRT ordered 200 Citaros after SBST, you wont even be seeing any new buses until the 300 SBST Citaro have completed delivery. And SBST is not able to order any K230UB, because their assembly line is held up with assembling the WEG, and will be held up until they have finished all the remaining wrights. That's the reason why they ordered the FBU Citaros instead.</p>
              <p>There's no point comparing which is better here using the keyboard, look into the daily operations and you will find out eventually. Whatever is good to you, might not be so to the bc, or to the passengers, or to the mechanics, or to the company's pockets, or even to the road users.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think the Citaros are much easier to maintain compared to the KUBs since an integral product will mean that all components have been tried and tested to work together as best as possible. I haven't been on any Citaros that are not in tip-top condition. No rattles or weird engine sounds. I think they're probably the best built buses on the roads today. </p></div>
