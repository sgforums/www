              <p>True that. But Im guessing SBST kinda foresee this requirement to come sooner or later. Thats why they stopped the 77xx series at where they are now, then reg the others under 3xxx with interior changes?</p>

              <p>True that, the aircon on KUBs is definitely much better than the Citaros. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> The one on Citaros are like blowing towards the top of the window, like anyone would sit that close to the window edge. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>But sometimes i wonder is it some kind of manufacturer restriction that they can't cut more holes into the existing panels for more A/C vents? Or they just don't want to touch the CBU interior of the Citaro?

              <p>Eventually they will do it, but there might be some complications. They'll probably have to wait till the warrenty expires (so they dont void it), and also figure out a way how to go about opening up holes into the panels as Mercedes Benz has used some portions inside the aircon ducts to place some components (e.g the air tanks) to save space beneath.</p>

              <p>SBS Transit Mercedes-Benz Citaros is one of the worst buses in the fleet. The bus fans wanted SBS Transit to have Citaros, but to their surprise, the Citaros in SBS Transit is very bad. SMRT Citaros I can still accept it, cause they were better in the case of air-conditioning and the design.</p>

              <p>The seats, IMHO, are terrible. The last good buses in the SBST fleet are probably the VO3x and B10M IV.</p>
              <p>Seriously though, the funny part about the K230UB is that it's being bought en masse by rapidKL and rapidPenang. With a very close bodywork.</p>
              <p>Anyhow, I still think we should have gone mass B7RLEs.</p>

              <p>Yes yes, the B10BLE CNGs are probably the smoothest SD around. They just seem to float around effortlessly with their soft suspension. Sadly, for some of the cngs the maintaience is lacking, as some of the gearboxes does not drop itself into Neutral before the bus stops, so the engine sounds like its going to stall everytime it stops.</p>
