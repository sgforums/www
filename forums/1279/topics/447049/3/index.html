              <p><br>So then these are the pointers to rebutt on this matter.</p>
              <p>1) Registration date: These buses as mentioned were manufactured only 1 year later, in fact if anyone has taken the ride and interior fitting, a lot of improvements has been made.</p>
              <p>2) Why no one realised in Scania's press release many years back that the bodyworks was in liaise w/ SBST. Why would people bother to spend time for just odd small orders to re-design the interior? Is it of any economic value addedness?</p>
              <p>The UK makers saw SBS or KMB ordering buses in typical hundreds, it gave them the chance to specify the body for the respective area's ops requirement.</p>
              <p>3) Side mention: If anyone remembered when RWS tendered out the shuttle contracts, I remembered someone ever mentioned abt low floor bus requirement...</p>
              <p>OK, I remembered saying abt the incline which now everyone's eye can see clearly, it's not meant for Asians actually.  So why would LTA want to impose something that both LE &amp; LF has it's flaws which are mutually exclusive?</p>

              I would highly doubt that LTA would ban low entry buses, whoever spreaded those rumours have to back it up with evidence or at least quote a credible source, because it doesn't seem logical, on what premise should LTA ban them? They don't differ much in terms of capacity, they don't differ in terms of wheelchair accessibility, they don't differ in terms of emission, nor do they differ in road space. In fact the low floor buses have added disadvantages when compared to low entry buses, they seem less capable of handling Asian crush loads and have poor passenger flows.
              
              Really, the things I have heard these days from some people have become too absurd, with very poor arguments to back them up.

              <p>Scania only offers its DC9 Diesel engines at 270hp rating with Euro 4 emission standards. Sbst could never have ordered a batch of E4 K270UB after its E5 K230UB, as this would be going backwards in terms of emissions standard.</p>

              <p>Well, all I'm going to say here is that it's a damn good thing the bunch of K230UB's went to Changi to do the Budget Terminal to Terminal 2 run - as recently as November 2011, they used high-floor buses, which are a pain if you have bags.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I prefer drop-axle floor - think VO/LO.</p>
