            <div class='col-md body'>Ok as a Co-Representative of Toa Payoh Interchange, allow me to say a few words....<br><br>Firstly, I would like to congratulate Toa Payoh Interchange itself and its operator - SBS Transit for managing this interchange efficently for the past 2 years. You guys have brought the standard of commuter travelling in Singapore to a higher level. From well located berths to differentiate the route which they exit Toa Payoh to the Interchange Officer and Traffic Inspector inspecting the arrival, departure and passenger load of high demand service, you guys have done an excellent job.<br><br>Toa Payoh Interchange has grown from strength to strength over the past 2 years. From its humble beginnings on 19th May 2002, it has never stop or fail to serve its commuters for a single day. Despite a temporary blackout one afternoon in early 2004, life at the interchange has never stopped there. Spotlights were lit to guide commuters to their correct berths and TIs were on standby to guide any elderly or disabled people in hand.<br><br>Toa Payoh Interchange has also seen its darkest days.. and that is during the SARS period in April. The interchange then was practically half-filled given that students had to stay at home for fear that they might contract SARS and also schools were closed because of this. However, this has never stopped Toa Payoh Interchange from halting or slowing down its services then. Business was as usual during those days even though human traffic decreased.<br><br>Here are some information on the shops around the interchange. On 19th May 2002, Toa Payoh Interchange, along with Popular Bookstore, CD Rama and MacDonald's were opened for business. At that time, foodcourt Koufu and NTUC Fairprice and a few others were undergoing renovations. Kiddy Palace, which is located on the third floor above Koufu, was opened on 1st June 2002. Breadtalk, Giordano and The Body Shop had their doors opened by then. Lee Hwa Diamond Boutique only set up shop between late June and early July 2002. Both NTUC Fairprice and Koufu were opened at around the same time with Kiddy Palace. All other shops in the vicinity were opened gradually between 19th May 2002 and early July 2002.<br><br>Now I would like to shed some light on the opening day itself. Yeo Cheow Tong arrived promptly at Toa Payoh Interchange Atrium Area @1100 hrs. After speaking for about 10-20 min, he steered a steering wheel to declare Toa Payoh Interchange opened.There's a plaque bearing the opening ceremony at the entrance from Kodak Express shop. Following that there were fun and games and activities galore for the young and old alike. The activities ended at 1530 hrs.<br><br>Back then in 2002, deployments on the bus services serving the interchange were nothing compared to now. Here's a summary of the services having models back then and not now.<br>SBST28: LO2x<br>SBST31: LO3x<br>SBST90: LO2x<br>SBST155: Scania NAC<br>SBST157: LO2x<br>SBST159: Mk4 DM3500<br>SBST163: Merz CAC<br>SBST231: Scania OAC<br>SBST232: Scania OAC<br>SBST235: Scania OAC.<br><br>In Feb 2003, Toa Payoh Interchange had seen its latest model in the SBS Transit fleet coming in: Volvo Super Olympian with Volgren Bodywork. It was there for a test drive and also for drivers to familiarise with the console of the vehicle. And who knows? Weeks after that, the VSO invaded SBST28 with 7 units and SBST31 with 3 units. Occasionally, you could catch a VSO on SBST8 and SBST157. In late 2003, SBS 9815 H migrated to SBST143, and has been on SBST143 ever since. I wonder when it will go back to SBST56?<br><br>Through the 2 years, deployments the services mentioned above have also changed. As the Leyland Olympian 2 axle were phrased out in 2003, the following services had also had their fleet changed:<br>SBST8: LO3x<br>SBST28: VSO<br>SBST31: VSO and Merz<br>SBST90: Scania NAC<br>SBST155: Scania OAC and Scania CAC<br>SBST157: Mk2, WA Merz<br>SBST159: Merz CAC<br>SBST163: Mk2, Mk3, Mk4 Strider, Mk4 DM3500<br>SBST231: Merz OAC<br>SBST232: Merz OAC<br>SBST235: Merz CAC<br><br>2 years on, and Toa Payoh interchange is as vibrant as ever. Elderly folk could be seen at the HDB Hub Underground Foodcourt idling their afternoon away, students strolling up and down the concourse area, students having their afternoon lunch at fast food restaurants and foodcourts, weekends having more people popping by Toa Payoh Int/Central to do their groceries and shopping etc.<br><br>Here are some facts on Toa Payoh Interchange<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> First Airconditioned Interchange in Singapore<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Located at junction of Lor 2 and Lor 6 Toa Payoh<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Has 2 MRT Exits<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Largest Concourse Area<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 14 Boarding Berths with 28 parking lots and 11 services<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 12 Queue Berths with 13 parking lots and 10 services<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 3 Alighting Berths<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Full SBST controlled Interchange<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> SBST Services: 19<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Shuttle Services: 1<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Doors of queue berths will open when a bus is present at the berth.<br><br>2 years on, I've seen many changes in Toa Payoh Interchange.

Toa Payoh Int is very spacious and has exits on most sides of the interchange, making the way around Central very easy.<br><br>Sengkang Int has a broken window pane near berth of 83/86. They used paper to cover it, not got holes liao. Also the one side of the door towards Sengkang Square after the berth on 965 can't be used.<br><br>Poor maintainence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Removed in favour of 3-axle VOs from BNDEP / AMDEP six months after introduction.
