            <div class='col-md body'>VEHICLE LOCATION SYSTEM (VLS)<br>This feature which is disables the ez-link points reader when the bus is not at a bus stop as detected by GPS, was spotted in use on TIB544E (Svc 189) and here i bring you some insights from my observations...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus on the road/just left interchange or terminal</span><br>Bus Entry Point (BEP) and Bus Exit Point (BXP) readers set to "Disabled" mode ("No Entry" logo) and does not accept card scans.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus approaching bus stop (enters bus bay) as detected by GPS</span><br>First, driver's console (Integrated Driver Fare Console or IDFC) updates to current stop's fare stage. Then, BEP readers are set to "ENTRY/EXIT" mode and BXP readers are set to "EXIT" mode with fare stages updated, a while before the doors actually open.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rear door close</span><br>BXP readers set to "Disabled" mode.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Front door close</span><br>BEP readers set to "ENTRY" mode for about 14 seconds before being set to "Disabled" mode.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are some interesting points:</span><br><br>The GPS only signals the IDFC to update to the current stop's fare stage and enable the readers only if GPS detects the bus as being <span style="color: red;">near the bus stop</span>. Thus, if it skips a bus stop, then the IDFC actually <span style="color: red;">will</span> update the fare stage and the <span style="color: red;">BEPs will be set to "ENTRY/EXIT" mode and BXPs to "EXIT" mode. Upon detection that bus is some distance away from the bus stop (about 25-50 metres away or 2-4 bus lengths), BEP is set to "ENTRY" and BXP is set to "Disabled" mode. After 14 seconds, BEP is also set to "Disabled" mode. Note that sometimes it does not detect that the bus had left the bus stop and thus sometimes BEPs and BXPs remain enabled until the next bus stop when the GPS notifies the IDFC to update fare stage and enabled readers to the correct modes.</span><br><br>If only the front door is open when bus is in bus bay, when the front door closes, BXP will be set to "Disabled" mode while BEP will be set to "ENTRY" mode for 14 seconds before being set to "Disabled" mode.<br><br>If only the rear door is open when bus is in bus bay, when the rear door closes, <span style="color: red;">BXP will be set to "Disabled" mode while BEP will be set to "ENTRY" mode for 14 seconds before being set to "Disabled" mode.<br></span><br><br>No passenger actually encountered any problems using this new system from my observations.<br><br>Anyway, this bus has no speed limiter fitted! Oh oh..<br><span style="color: red;"><br>Roll out date for TIBS AMDEP is confirmed to be on Monday, 5th Jan 2004. Others have yet to be confirmed, including KJDEP (Svc 189).<br><br>There are some bugs relating to one or two-lane roads and loop services where the GPS detects it as the bus stop in the opposite direction across the road instead if the pair of stops are too close. It has surfaced sparingly on Svc 189 on West Coast Rd. Currently the system is made more accurate with the help of an odometer to detect the distance covered by the bus, from what i heard from the driver. Now it looks like Svc 175 is in most trouble since it is a loop service and Lim Chu Kang Rd is a major problem.<br><br>Additional info: Bukit Batok Int (BBDEP) has overnight parking in additional to Yishun Int (YIDEP) for most services there except Svcs 61, 106 and 852.<br><br>Additional info: Departure times from BBI for 544E (it may change) as noted from the PM shift timesheet is 15:20, 16:42, 18:19, 19:38, 20:48 and 21:58.
