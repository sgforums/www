Conclusion about the BC: she just wants to extort some more money from the passengers. I don't think she cares about any complains at all. Majoriy of the BCs who check people's EZ-link are from BRBP/AMDEP. But some are from SLBP and HGDEP as well. ARBP/BBDEP &amp; BNDEP not so often.

My stand on this is that if you do not insist on not paying the extra 35Â¢, then you deserve to pay that 90Â¢.

I think that BC likes to target children and teenagers as they are portrayed as defenseless people who wouldn't argue for themselves. So if you really want retaliate, never give 90Â¢ to the bus driver. And be insistent on that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

So she didnt cheat anybody. And i think you are making an assumption that the bus driver was making an assumption that everyone was a dropout. Much as I feel that the bus driver had no flexibility in handling such concession cases, she is still theoretically right.</div>

Then send a complain to SBST, better still, go STOMP, ST Forums, Lianhe Zaobao Forums etc and after this, I don't think the BC dares to do this again.</div>
