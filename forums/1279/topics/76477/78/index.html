And after school, people usually walk out (2 bus stops only) and take a bus because it is simply not worth waiting for 77 or 173 just to get to Jln Jurong Kechil.</div></blockquote>You and TIB589B discuss it nicely and keep it this way. At least you debate in this friendly manner, there won't be any flame war posts.<br><br>I have no further comments about this as I don't live far far away from Bukit Batok.<br><br>Hope you and TIB589B will discuss this in a friendly manner.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
