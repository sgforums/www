            <div class='col-md body'>Well... When everything is fine and normal, human beings tend to take things for granted. But when something goes wrong, human beings tend to remember the negative experience for a long time. This is fine, because evolution teaches us to learn from unpleasant experience so that we'll do something to prevent the repetition of such unpleasant experiences.<br><br>But somehow Singaporeans have "evolved" a bit too much. They have become too sensitive to every little things, and even minor things like one green bean in a red bean soup can provoke a major complaint. Complaints are good in a sense that they encourage improvement and development. (Many foreign visitors comment that Singapore is such an efficient country.) But too much complaints can be rather irritating. People complain when an indian sits beside him. People complain when the bus goes too slow. People complain when the bus goes too fast. People complain when they see a Nissan bus. Etc etc.... It just takes one single unpleasant incident to make a Singaporean complain like hell and remember the unhappiness for eternity (even though he/she may have already experienced 1000 "normal" incidents without any problems).<br><br>Life is not perfect. We should just learn to be gracious and appreciate the benefits of the 1000 normal incidents instead of thinking and complaining about the 1001st incident. After all, we are very fortunate compared to many other countries in the world.<br><br>Complaining is alright as long as it is done with moderation and with (good and logical) reasons. Don't abuse the power to complain.</div>
