              <p>Seems like this service will originate from Tampines and loop at Changi Business Park.</p>
              <p>I guess it will follow Tampines Ave 7, Tampines CC, Simei Road route to Changi Business Park. If so, the route will be very similar to 38. SBST could potentially also divert 38 via Changi Business Park before routing it to Tanah Merah MRT and Bedok. Though not very likely!</p>
              <p>This will be an excellent service for all office-goers in Tampines, Simei area who are forced to go to TNM and change to go to Expo and then walk or take shuttle bus. If merged with 38, good potential to ply DDs on this service as well.</p>

              <p>38 does not go to the other end of Bedok South road. It does the stretch on Bedok South Road, where also svc 12 plies. I am saying there is a need for service on the other side of Bedok South road to TNM MRT as now only 229 plies there and to get to Bedok MRT, there is a Chai Chee loop that people have to do.</p>
