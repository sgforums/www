            <div class='col-md body'>It seems like SBST dominates mainly on the Eastern regions of Singapore while SMRT dominates mostly on the Northern Western region of Singapore. However, there are new SBST bus services to Woodlands and Yishun and new SMRT bus services to Tampines. This shows signs of crossing each other so called borders. I think that there should be more crossing of borders so that commuters can experience what is it like to board the SMRT bus or a SBST bus.</div>
