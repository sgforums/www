            <div class='col-md body'>I was at Kranji MRT Bus stop(towards Woodlands), where the lights at the bus stop blacked out. I flagged down a Scania L113CRL on 961 and boarded it. The BC opened the door as usual and I stepped in. I heard the BC said, 'Sorry, you cannot board the bus.' The BC ask me, 'Itu orang, kawan kau?(Is that person your friend?)' and I denied. He shut the door and moved off. The BC said to me, 'Itu orang tua sangat busuk. Tak boleh naik 961. 178 baru boleh.(That old man stinks. He could not take 961. Can only take 178.' I didn't realise till I looked at the old man at the bus stop. He was stinky indeed. I know there's a rule that states, 'No Durians inside Bus'.<br><br>I think that the BC want to ensure that his passengers are happy. In other words, to ensure the passenger's comfort and safety. I think 178 is a good bus for him. At least got CAC Nissan, so that the stink can go out via the window. I pity him but, I regreted leaving him at the busstop and would have brought him back to my house and let him bathe there before he goes off on his journey. Let him be fresh and clean again.<br><br>P.S: Next Batch of Volvo B10M Mark IIs leaving us in 3 days time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, does this mean you and the driver gang up and hate service 178 together. Nah, I not trying to scold but the problem is if the Scania on 178 comes along, then how? Cannot take also? And some of those CAC Nissans does not have open windows...<br>Plus, Nissans are also buses, not some scrap metal. I always take 178. Does that mean I or any other people taking 178 are also dirty and stinky and should not take other services too? Learn to appreciate, and don't say that he should take what service and not this...</div>
