              <p>I start with my one: 5 years ago, there was a man on Orchard Rd going to Shenton Way. Then, a 167 bus arrived. He boarded it and asked if this bus goes there and the BC said "If it goes it goes. If it dosent it dosent" and just drove off leaving him behind</p>

              <p>I was once on 358 east loop towards Pasir Ris Int. I fell asleep halfway and by the time I woke up, the bus was already at the west loop boarding berth.</p>
              <p>Since I wasn't in a hurry, I decided to stay on the bus until it finished the west loop. But I fell asleep again and this time, the bus was at the east loop boarding berth when I woke up.</p>
              <p>So I ended up travelling through 2.5 loops on 358...</p>

              <p>Lol this actually happened to me a few years back...</p>
              <p>So I was on 16 along Old Airport Rd with my friend and y'all know how there is an emergency hammer between the rear facing seats at the rear of Citaros.So my friend (who was sitting at the window seat) somehow had accidently detached the emergency hammer from the holder and idk but this somehow triggered an alarm to the BC I think and the BC lost his cool at us and started hurling vulgarities at me and my friend for detaching the emergency thinking we were playing punk despite me and my friend apologizing and trying to explain to him that it was an accident. He even threatened us to a fight and claimed that my face was 'provoking him' before eventually storming off back to his seat. Me and my friend were like WTF and we were also damn paiseh at that time as there were other pax on board giving us the 'look'. </p>
              <p>After we alighted the BC drove away and he turned behind giving us the scorn look... I contemplated giving feedback to SBST about that asshole BC but eventually let it slide. Maybe job too stressful for BC but he was still being a dick though. After that incident I temporarily avoided taking 16 fearing I might run into the 'hooligan' BC again...</p>
