              <p><strong>For many people out there that are wondering how do we get cameo spotting easily, here's a few tips :<br><br>1. Bus not in perm service.<br>This is the most basic type of cameo spotting. Prefably for feeder services like 325. It only has SBS920X, SBS948S, SBS973T, SBS1937S, SBS1997T and SBS2656X. Whenever you see a bus not in there, example SBS2665Z, it is a cameo. Watch out for crossovers though, SBS964U and SBS2666S crossovers to 325 every weekdays during AM/PM peak. If those buses appear on non-peak timing, it is a cameo.<br><br>2. Bus with advertisement.<br>This is also another easy way of spotting. Easiest to spot for services that has no ads or have only a few buses with ad. For example, serivce 101. It does not have any bus with ads. if you spot a bus with ad, it is guranteed cameo, like SBS6088J on 101. Then you double-check with SgWiki, the bus may be perm 101 and received an ad though. The second way is to spot a bus with a different type of advertisement. For example, servicd 325 [ again! ]. It currently only has SBS2656X which bears a rear advert. If you spot any bus with full body ad or skyliners, it is a cameo. Colour too makes the difference. Like SBS2677K, it's rear ad is black-blue in colour while SBS2656X's ad is red and yellow. Still, watch out for SBS2666S which bears a full body SDIC ad and crossovers to 325 every weekday during AM/PM peak.<br><br>3. Model not present in fleet.<br>This is the easiest way to spot demonstrator buses and debuts. Services like 101, 112 and 325 does not have a single KUB in it's fleet. When you spot a KUB on it, it is a cameo. Likewise for demonstrator buses. But when they are spare, whenever you spot it you immediately know it is a cameo, for SBS8030L and SBS8033D, which are both SLBP SP. Since they are spare, whenever they cameo on a certain service, it is 100% cameo unless it permed some other service.<br><br>4. Single-bus services.<br>This only applies to services with 1 bus only, excluding crossovers. Services 11, 84 and 115. Cameos are easily spotted, for they only have 1 model of bus on it. 11 and 84 got crossovers too, a KUB and a Strider respectively. Best time to spot a cameo is during off-peak hours. Just combine tip no. 1, 2 and 3 and you have it.<br><br>5. Newly registered buses.<br>This applies to new buses, the MAN A22, the citaros and the wright Batch 2B, though the registration of the citaros have paused currently for the time being. New buses, are also easily spotted for it's shiny livery and especially it's reflecting rims. Do note that SMRT's MAN A22 buses sometimes undergo washing which makes it's rims still shiny, like KJDEP'S SMB200A. You can too help to spot perm depot too, except for certain services like 147 and 165, which are dual-depot controlled and can be only be confirmed depot control either via bus timetable or you wait it to cameo on other service that is sole-depot controlled. Like SBS3110Y, newly registered and cameoed on 165. It is easily said to be HGDEP when it cameoed on 62, since servicd 62 is HGDEP controlled.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>6. Depot transfer.<br>This is only applicable to people who have recongnised most of the buses in a certain depot or demonstrator buses being transferred. This is somewhat a easy/hard cameo spotting. As we all know, SLBP and HGDEP is currently trading buses. If you spot a bus that is controlled by SLBP, like SBS2788Z, cameoing on 153, which is not controlled by SLBP, it is a depot transfer to HGDEP.<br><br>7. Perm stix confirmation.<br>This also too is an alternative way of tip no. 1. When you board the bus, you look into the BC's cabin. For older model buses there should be a white paper with a certain number or ''SP'' imprinted on it, can be found near the BC window area. For newer buses, like the citaros and some KUBs, the perm stix is stickied behind the coin box. It is harder to spot. But for wrights, its perm stix can be either on the BC's window pillar or on the EDS control panel on the ceiling of the BC cabin. For example, you happily board a bus on 88, prefably a vo3x, and you spot ''157'' perm stix, and you immediately know it is a cameo since a 157 bus is cameoing on 88. This is not applicable for ARBP, since they do not or rarely uses perm stix and they use markings instead to show that it is a ARBP bus.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">For SMRT bus spotting tips, please post here too. I'm only a junior of SMRT spotting and not skilled yet. Please post any tips about buses here too!</span></strong></p>

              <p>Yes they can be easily seen inside the BC cabin. Some of the BNDEP KUBs had their perm stix placed on the EDS cover, making everybody looking forward in the bus able to see it. I remembered one of the KUB on 291 had it.</p>

              Though some pf their buses like wrights have it pasted on the

              <p>Peak hour has full of cameos especially bus who came in to start PM and AM split shift. Best time to spot cameos as u can see buses brunching together. Off peak hours is boring to watch bus </p>
