              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">To improve en-route bus reliability, LTA will conduct a two-year trial of the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) (previously known as the Quality Incentive Framework) for 22 bus services. The 22 bus services will be progressively brought onto the BSRF in the first half of the year, with the first batch of 15 services starting in February and March. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Under the BSRF, the regularity of bus arrival intervals at bus stops is measured by an indicator known as Excess Wait Time (EWT). The lower the EWT score, the better the bus service reliability. Bus operators are rewarded or penalised based on whether their EWT score for a service is above or below the EWT baseline. Similar incentive-penalty schemes have been practised in some other cities, including London. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br></span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">To earn rewards or avoid penalties, operators need to enhance their en-route management of bus operations. This means making appropriate interventions and giving guidance to the bus drivers even as the buses are running on the roads, in order to regulate bus travelling speed and to reduce long gaps between consecutive buses. On occasion, buses may be required to wait for up to a minute or two at bus stops as long as they are not causing obstructions in order to regulate intervals. This will help to address pertinent concerns by commuters over the timeliness of bus arrivals. (More information on how BSRF works is available in </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" title="Annex A" href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/press/2014/20140106_Annex_A_Factsheet_on_Bus_service_reliability_framework.pdf">Annex A</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;">.)</span></li>

              <p>Not necessary. There are incentives for exceeding the target. If I read the article correctly, 6 seconds = 1 EWT unit for the purpose of calculating penalties or incentives. The target EWT could be 2 minutes (more or less depending on route), as what is stated in the example given by LTA as a satisfactory standard.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit need not worry. They are already well prepared for this.</p>
              <p>But I worry for SMRT Buses. EWT is designed to alter behaviour through goal-setting. The BCs, given what they are currently doing, are going to have a difficult time adjusting to the new EWT scheme.</p>

              <p>LTA/SBST want people to use Sv 53 instead of 113. Hence, fleet of 53 increased from 20 buses to 25 within the last 1.5 year with 3 BSEP add and 2 from SBST side.  53A/53B frequency also improved. DD given to 45A but nothing has been done for 113. 113 is clearly a loss making route because of its Kovan- Hougang route, where bus almost always goes empty with just 15-20 pax on board. Hence, no improvement to 113 yet despite so many efforts of people here complaining to both SBST and LTA.</p>
