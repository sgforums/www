            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from Brotherchen1982's link<br><br>Singapore News // Thursday, April 19, 2007<br><br>Move in, please<br>New buses, seating will ease congestion at doors<br><br>Leong Wee Keat<br>weekeat@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>IT IS a common grouse among commuters Â— a long-awaited bus arrives, crowded at the front and the exit doors, but with plenty of standing room at the rear.<br>.<br>This sight normally raises the ire of finance executive Karen Tan. During the morning peak hours, the 30-year-old often knocks on the bus windows and gestures at passengers to move in so that others can board.<br>.<br>"The bus captain gets the impression that the bus is full, and does not open the door," Ms Tan explained. "But in reality there is usually plenty of room at the rear."<br>.<br><strong><span style="color: red;">With SBS Transit rolling out 100 new buses in July and new seating arrangements, the public transport operator hopes passengers like Ms Tan will have a smoother rider.</span></strong><br>.<br>On these buses, two seats at the rear will be removed Â— reducing the seating capacity to 23. The extra space created would give passengers more standing room and encourage them to move to the back.<br>.<br>SBS Transit's latest effort comes on the back of a "move to the rear" campaign launched in February on three services Â— Nos 15, 27 and 36. A recorded message reminds passengers to proceed to the rear.<br>.<br>The new single deck buses, bought at a cost of $35 million, will also be more spacious. Commuters can expect more leg room Â— up to 2.5cm between seats Â— and headroom (cabin height will go up by almost half-a-metre).<br><br>Does this person knows what we don't ?<br><br>Do we expect to see the 100 new buses in July ? The bodywork has not even started not to mention about the design of the bus being comfirmed. I wonder how much manpower is needed to build all 100 new buses from now until July presuming the chassis are here and bodywork design is comfirmed.</div>

During the morning peak hours, the 30-year-old often knocks on the bus windows and gestures at passengers to move in so that others can board.<br>.<br>"The bus captain gets the impression that the bus is full, and does not open the door," Ms Tan explained. "But in reality there is usually plenty of room at the rear."<br>.<br>[b]<span style="color: red;">With SBS Transit rolling out 100 new buses in July and new seating arrangements, the public transport operator hopes passengers like Ms Tan will have a smoother rider.</span></strong><br>.<br>On these buses, two seats at the rear will be removed Â— reducing the seating capacity to 23. The extra space created would give passengers more standing room and encourage them to move to the back.<br>.<br>SBS Transit's latest effort comes on the back of a "move to the rear" campaign launched in February on three services Â— Nos 15, 27 and 36. A recorded message reminds passengers to proceed to the rear.<br>.<br>The new single deck buses, bought at a cost of $35 million, will also be more spacious. Commuters can expect more leg room Â— up to 2.5cm between seats Â— and headroom (cabin height will go up by almost half-a-metre).<br><br>Does this person knows what we don't ?<br><br>Do we expect to see the 100 new buses in July ? The bodywork has not even started not to mention about the design of the bus being comfirmed. I wonder how much manpower is needed to build all 100 new buses from now until July presuming the chassis are here and bodywork design is comfirmed.

As long as there is 1 new bus that is WAB friendly, and is a single decker that is introduced in July, SBST can proclaim that the new bus is out.</div>
