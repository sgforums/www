The Bus Captain was unaware of this as he had felt some air blowing out from the vents and the buzzer did not light up to indicate any malfunctioning.<br><br>We have since reminded him to strictly follow procedures by checking the coolness of the air-conditioning prior to the trip. He has also been counselled to comply with Standard Procedures in politely handling incidents involving the breakdown of air-conditioning while the bus is on service. On the bus arrival time, our records, which are based on satellite tracking, show that Service 138 arrived on schedule - which is an interval of 14 minutes.<br><br>And finally, we thank Mr Khoo for his feedback on the age of some of the buses plying the Night Safari route. <strong>We are in the process of purchasing new ones to replace old ones</strong> and will deploy them to Service 138 as appropriate.</blockquote></div>
