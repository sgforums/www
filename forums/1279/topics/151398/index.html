It used to be friends of TIBS and when SMRT bought over TIBS, this Club had changed  its title to Friends of SMRT. I am one of their inactive member. Only attended 1 meetup since yr 2001. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I am thinking tat since it is posted here, at the bus forum, and not the MRT/LRT forum, i thought tat it is for us, bus fans. But after reading more replies, i realise tat im wrong. Plus there is a no need to insult my school. It just shows tat u don't think and respect. What have this got to do with my school. It is purely base on my guessing and my admission has got nothing to do with u. Jus FYI, i was admitted to HCI not because of my PSLE score, i go in through DSA, so if u tink im not fit to be in my school now, Im fine with it. Dun tink if ppl is wrong, and u can jus gif a reply. Who noes if u hurt somebody's feelings. Insulting ppl school is definately not the right thing to do....Ok, i apologise again for not checking before replying. Sorry for any inconvinence cause. I do not wish to start any flame war here, if he purely scold mi bcoz i reply sumthing wrongly, im fine bcoz i really did sumthing wrong BUT he insulted my school. Well, tat izzit very approprate. I will reply no more regarding this to ensure no flame war is started.[/b]</div>

She is screwing up the bus operations of the former Tibs Holdings. In the past, Tibs ever showed they were better than SBS.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Alex as you can see, there is a rule that there should be "wars" and no matter how much you dislike a person, you should NOT scold him and the school off this way. How would you feel if people were to reply to you this way? We are just junior members and we should just watch and learn and not make too much comments. This is courtesy. That is what my PRIMARY school teaches. To add on, let his school decide what to do, you also cannot do anything, anyway, this is off school wad. Just calm down and relax.</div>
