There are no problems with the gearboxes, they are pretty sweet, pity about the governing to 60km/h, that's all.<br></div>

Both 811, 495 are long affected. Same for 1074. The transmission sounds normal, but in fact is not right.<br><br>I suppose that this transmission thingy needs a observant driver or anyone with keen ears, plus the manufacturer's electronic test to confirm. Often the drivers will know, because the transmission feels tardy and they'll often apply more torque to increase the acceleration.</div>
