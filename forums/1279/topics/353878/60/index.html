              <p>what you said above is what i also feel too. what's there to be so excited about 53H in CCK when there are also OCs? well, if it's because of the fullbody ad on the OC that makes it a little bit special...that's a bit superficial le. OCs are quite common in CCK, same type of chassis and bodywork...</p>

              <p><br>Thats why.They are almost in every CCK svc and 307 has a full fleet of them.They see the OCs everyday at CCK and seeing a OC with a ad just for one day at CCK must be the same thing?</p>

              <p>maybe SMRT Buses Luver don't have the time to chase 53H on it's perm svc. That's why he's so "excited" when 53H does a cameo svc, which is 307. I was the one who sms-ed him about it, and he wanted to chase it, since it's a full day cameo.</p>
              <p>I bet there's nothing wrong about 53H doing 307 right? He's just excited about it only.. No hard feelings bro..</p>

              <p>Folks as an enthusiast should understand that a bus, new or old
                  even, is just a bus to the common people. Going hoo-haa over a
                  'cameo' in your sense would sadly, return a sense of 'crazy' from
                  common people!</p>
              <p>Like how sbs&amp;tibs described earlier, it would be better if a
                  natural sense is maintained. It would be good to go hoo-haa (inside
                  yourself and not visually/aural) once in a while, but bad
                  impression from common folks grow when these hoo-haa are amplified.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just to say, i did my 'hoo-haa' inside myself, and i didnt express my feelings towards others (as in go crazy when i saw this bus on 307). I just felt excited in my heart only, and my classmate wanted to know abt what happened, since he saw my SMS from Interception during D &amp; T class. Then, when i described abt the bus (nicely, not as in crazily) saying to him abt the bus with full blue body ads (...blah blah blah..). He also got fascinated about it when i said abt that, since he wants to know more abt buses (hes not a bus fan anyway).</p>
              <p>What happened actually was that that day after school, me &amp; my classmate went to take 307 after CCA, then he said he wanna take the special bus on 307 and i said okay. Then, 72C came on 307 and we took it. We didnt feel upset when 53H didnt came. Inside the bus, he agreed to me that he'll stay up inside the bus and take 307 1 round twrds yew tee. Then, when our bus reached at CCK Ctrl (towards Teck Whye), our bus was suddenly bunched up with 53H since that bus had greater demand than ours. We then like said 'Yes!' to ourselves when we saw that bus. My fren said that when our bus overtook 53H, we can alight this bus and transfer to take 53H (it was his decision), and i agreed. The bus finally overtook 53H at Teck Whye Lane and we alighted the bus and waited patiently for 53H to come. My fren didnt acted like a just-gotten-out-from-a-mental-hospital attitude when we took this bus, neither do i. I took just one pic for remembrance of 53H on 307 &amp; then we both alighted at int. Thats all. Once again, i dont over-react at public when i see this bus on 307. Only once here at SGF, and im sorry to show that attitude.</p>
              <p>&gt; to interception, thanks for knowing on whats going on.</p>

              <p>To me, I think <span>SMB53H</span> on 307 is nothing special after all, even it bears the <span>NEA</span> ads. First of all, is <span>SMB53H</span> special after all just becuase of the <span>NEA</span> Ads, seriously, I just can’t understand why people want to make a fuss over it, unless you are telling me that <span>SMB53H</span> had extra additional features like the <span>LED</span> display? There’s nothing special though after all, it’s just a common sight of OC…</p>

              <p><br>Haha, as per said on my post above.</p>
              <p>Maybe he wants to take a ride on a 53H, after it changes to the blue coloured ad. But he doesnt' have the time. Since 53H went on a cameo svc, which is 307, then he finds it as an opportunity. So that's why he went to make a big hoo haa about it.</p>
              <p>But guys, it's the past already. No point fussing about it again.</p>
