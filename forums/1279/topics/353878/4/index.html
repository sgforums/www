              <p><br>Sorry, I experience this in all my OC rides. The air con from an OC even stuffier than many of the O405s. I just say out of my personal experience. I even sweat in one of the rides.</p>
              <p>If you want to distort the statistics with me just because I say things that you don't agree with on SMRTB, then I think you are just simply too narrow minded.</p>
              <p> And what if the OCs are better, the company do not maintain well. I even saw dried vomit in one of my rides in 851. Enough said.</p>
              <p>And I didn't say that I like KUBs a lot nor I hate OCs to the core.</p>
              <p>The OC500LE is a good chassis but unfortunately under the wrong company.</p>

              <p>Thank you, I know what does AMDEP, WLDEP and KJDEP means.<br>Kranji Depot doesn't even know how to maintain its buses, saw a lot of the buses with burnt marks/algaes on the bus body. The technical aspects are even worse.</p>
              <p>My friend living in Bukit Batok is very pissed with the bus services in his area for many years.</p>
              <p>So if you prefer OC then so be it. I'm not forcing anyone to hate OCs, or hate KUBs. But you think KJDEP is so great about fixing its OCs, then so be it. I never forget my trip on one of the KJDEP MK1 bendy. Horrible.</p>
              <p>I know some people in this forum can't take critics/negative feedbacks, so I don't wish to engage too much in such conversations.</p>

              <p>Well, at least give SMRT some credit for their courage to try something different/unique over SBST, although not necessary successful. One recent example can be the original driver's window found on the OC500LEs before being retrofitted to standard windows.</p>
              <p>Ya i agree with you on TIBS. They're one of the best bus co around. Hispano MK I bendies with special bendy bus logo + Hispano logos, Habits with the Pinafarina on the side with the bus livery, Friends of TIBS etc .Maybe if TIBS was still around they'd probably procure a fully low- floor front to rear WAB bus (Citaro?) to compete with SBST's K230UB which is a half SLF. Just like they brought in the EABO Scanias Zero step before SBS's 2888T came into service.</p>
