              <p>I know - that's what I kept saying from day 1 that DTL2 will not
              impact 190 and 972's loading.</p>
              <p>Loadings that have been impacted are 67, 171, 700,
              960. </p>
              <p>But 171 and 700 still have good loading between Dunearn road and
              Orchard road as it is the fastest link. The loading drops right
              after. 700 comes to Whitley road bus stop on its way to BPJ with
              only 30-40 pax on board. But at Scotts road near Newton MRT, it has
              around 70 pax. So you can guess where the bulk of loading went.
              Same for 171. </p>
              <p>960 likewise don't see super crowded buses anymore except
              weekends but it is because of workers near Mandai who go to
              Bugis/Little India area.</p>

              <p>For 67, I assure there should be 3 split shift duties transferred to 960 (to fulfill the 3 missing buses). I assure you, many people couldn't get up (26/32 buses, that will be alright - 81.25%).</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, I think Sbs 134 will have very poor loading for the first month. After that, it will have consistent loads because it passes by many old HDB flats and connects many old estates. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Look at how crowded 43/76/135 are.... Of course 134 will take time to pick up its loading, but it will definitely not have poor loading. You just need to wait for people to realise that 134 is a replacement for 76.</p>
              <p>Similar to 201's case - its loading between Kent Ridge and Clementi picked up super fast, while that of Clementi to Pandan picked up much slower.</p>
              <p>I do expect 134's Sims Place - Paya Lebar stretch to have poor loading, though.</p>

              <p>if the 70-90 paxes board along upper paya lebar/paya lebar to marine pardage/tanjung katong, then it is reasonable during peak,.. but sv134 does not serve the entire stretch of paya lebar.... it only serve one stop ....so do u expect 70-90 pax on 134?</p>

              <p>Look at how crowded 43/76/135 are.... Of course 134 will take
              time to pick up its loading, but it will definitely not have poor
              loading. You just need to wait for people to realise that 134 is a
              replacement for 76.</p>
              <p>Similar to 201's case - its loading between Kent Ridge and
              Clementi picked up super fast, while that of Clementi to Pandan
              picked up much slower.</p>
              <p>I do expect 134's Sims Place - Paya Lebar stretch to have poor
              loading, though.</p>

              <p>201 is difference, as there are not much alternative service between kent ridge and clementi... while there are 135/43 from paya lebar to marine parade....</p>
              <p>of course if 134 come to paya lebar mrt during peak hour before 135/43, then definitely it will have more paxes....which is the same as current situation..... just wait and see then... </p>

              <p>For 201, demand at West Coast Rd mainly comes from Kent Ridge Sec School and Blk 726 Market, where there's 175 to share the load (and 282 also if you don't mind taking a bit longer).</p>
              <p>Although I do agree that 134's loading will be less than 76 as it does not cover Upp Paya Lebar Rd. But if some people are taking CCL or other bus services (if 43 hasn't arrived) to Paya Lebar and transfer there, then we may see better loading... Overall it is still a rather poor decision to plan 134 like this.</p>

              <p>You may argue that BSEP is waste in terms of loadings, but that's probably not the case from a commuter's point of view, especially in terms of frequency.</p>
              <p>At least with more buses (albeit some are empty), people need less time to wait for buses (unless there's really severe bunching) and will be more satisfied. Especially if the frequency used to be really terrible... (By the way 76 does have poor frequency at Marine Terrace at times due to bunching)</p>
              <p>Adding a few more buses do not cost that much, but will make commuters' life much easier. (Although 143M really has issues especially with 201 in place now).</p>

              <p>Ofcourse that's a given and there is no end to it. Then we should stop cribbing about 134 in the first place because it will ensure better frequency for Marine Terrace residents than 76 and we should also not crib about 150 anymore as it provides more benefit to commuters who want to go Eunos instead. </p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, I think Sbs 134 will have very poor loading for
                  the first month. After that, it will have consistent loads because
                  it passes by many old HDB flats and connects many old estates.
                  Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Not true, there were almost a bus load full of pax on sv134 citaro today. About 35-40 pax. This is due to the free rides given on sv134, people understand the loss of sv76 and promotional posters are well set up along the affected bus stops.</p>
              <p>free rides makes a big difference to the pax also, take a look at sv47 loading on the first few days. Almost an empty bus, there were no free rides given and it passes by the estates. Good move by the authorities this round.</p>
              <p>same situation for sv124 cut in route to Hbf, believe sv120 had free rides also.</p>
              <p>sv47 can have full sd fleet on Sundays. Loading will be just right.</p>
