              <p>I'm q sure most of us here know what's going on with 972, we do not need to live there to see it. And we are not about to deny its loading either. </p>
              <p>However this is not a reason to say that 969 deserves no more DDs and it has low loading. Think you are underestimating the deal with 969 with the typical LTA attitude. Get yourself down to Tamp to "see the point" yourself?</p>

              <p>It seems like some people doesn't realize the contrast as to why some services need DDs more and others do and in this case, That town that I've mentioned has decent connections to most places in the east and you just need some adjustments and you're there.</p>
              <p>Unlike that town, It is still a growing area and the demands cannot be ignored. With more flats being built and connections to places are limited, and hence the prioritization of high capacity buses and I don't think he has ever come across a situation where he missed 3 buses of a certain service because they are packed and probably didn't understand why they have more DDs than that particular service which infact can be dealt with flexibility by switching buses which infact might be a faster way if time is of essence.</p>
              <p>I still do not see the need for that particular service to have full DDs and in fact DDs can be used to utilize other needy services that has poor connections to different places.</p>

              <p>Let me ask you something. Which other service brings you to Tampines directly? Dont say its 39: that bus literally would take you half an hour more to get there just because it winds around Pasir Ris</p>
              <p>Do you actually see the routes carefully before evaluating? Its ridiculous how some people say that there are other options to get to your destination yet do not reach to your destination fast as the main one</p>
              <p>I can tell you. 969 can go all the way to McDonalds at Tampines during peak hours. Why would anyone wanna take such winding routes when you have an express route? No one would want to go to work and go home late. If I were to often take a winding route when there is an express route when I am going to work, I can expect my sack in a few days</p>
              <p>Tell me why 168 has full DDs then and everyone rides it to get back to Woodlands. Why take the route when I have 969 too which goes through Yishun to get to Woodlands? Not many people likes to waste time and transferring you know</p>

              <p>Yes. No one likes to take winding route when they are in a hurry but have you try to be flexible where there is no 969 in sight, or 969 has to skip certain stops due to full loadings and rather than to complain 969 doesn't have enough DDs, shouldn't you do something about it, rather than waiting for the next 969, why not find a way out if you know the next 969 is going to take a long time to arrive? For Instance If I do not see 969, and 39,85 and 858 arrives first and alight at Jalan Kayu, Then take 168 and alight near Tampines One and that will save time rather than to wait for 969 and end up late.</p>
              <p>For 161/168's case I believe most people (especially the RP/TP* students) see this as their fastest way home in Tampines/Woodlands and 969 just takes way too long which is why they have more DDs than any other services.</p>
              <p>*For 168 only</p>

              <p>I'm afraid not many people wont ever try to do that. You see, 969 skips many bus stops while other services dont. Since people always assume that express services always win, almost no one will do that in addition to the waiting time you need for the alternate services to arrive (unless you're lucky). Sorry bro, almost no one is going to heed your advice as they hold this assumption very strongly. Furthermore, they still trust the service like the 190 case when people could only take a bus after 13 buses passed</p>
              <p>Isnt 969 supposed to be the fastest way back home to Yishun too? Anyway it is still running on the same expressway as 39 and it has more DDs than 39 bcos you know, people assume that DDs are a bonus and can take advantage of them. To change people's minds is very difficult. People will still stick to their assumptions anyway</p>

              <p>Do you even know wtf u talking about... You arw shooting yourself all over...</p>
              <p>First you ADMIT 969 can get v packed, even EXPERIENCED before... So whats ur prob with adding more DDs to this svc, seeing how even with its current number of DDs this svc couldnt cope with the pax?!</p>
              <p>Another thing... You say 168 is diff case coz 969 is "way too long"... 39 is longer than that you know!! And so are ANY of your alternatives! Yet you say ppl always have these choices and hence no need add DDs!!</p>
              <p>Wake up your bloody idea!!</p>
              <p>So now when there are not enough supply you think it's the pax fault! What Cock logic is this? Hey, then what is BSEP for? Liddat your pretty little 972 also dont need so much DDs la... If cannot board 972, DONT COMPLAIN!!! Go take 190... Or 700... </p>
              <p>Anyways I have no idea what your entire post is about actl... Haha</p>

              <p>Not ture. During peak hours, at least 15-20 adult passengers board towards city, and an average of 5-8 people boarding at the bus stops until phoenix lrt.</p>
              <p>Also not a good idea to let 190 skip bpj, don't forget, there are quite an amount of passengers who can only use 190 towards the 3 bus stops before expressway to save the hassle of transferring</p>
