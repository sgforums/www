              <p>If it's just about frequency and rest time for BCs, 76 could have been extended from Marine Terrace to Eunos via Still Rd (enter Marine Terrace in both directions with red/white plates). In this way Marine Terrace residents will have better frequency on 76 towards Paya Lebar because it starts from Eunos. AMK residents taking 76 towards YCK may be affected as the suggested 76 will be longer than the current 76 and hence have poorer frequency, but still better than the old 76.</p>
              <p>If this is still not enough in terms of frequency, introduce 134 together with the suggested 76. 134 can ply Haig Rd or something to reduce duplication with the suggested 76.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              better massive fleet add sv 156 to force ppl to take sv 156 from Buangkok/Serangoon Nth/Boundary Rd to Bishan instead of taking bus to Amk/Serangoon and force ppl to go to 6th Ave Stn from Clementi/Holland. 
              156 is also a quick way to go to Thomson/Whitley schools, but unfortunately I always spot low loading in this sector.
