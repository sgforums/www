              <p>Hi mr array88, super unlikely that people will go to Punggol to transfer. Serangoon is much more nearer to many other areas in Singapore. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>There aren't many people who take 103 from Serangoon to SAP. it is mostly people who live along YCK Road &amp; Sengkang West who will take 103. 103 also gets more load from the Seletar Circus transfer stop, where many people from east/west will board.</p>
              <p>Sv 117 may not get huge but has a decent 30-35 pax from Punggol MRT towards SAP in AM. </p>

              <p>Hmm basically when I mean downsized by half for Sv 196, that was based on the fact that they wanted to throw a DD as fleet add onto Sv 196 initially.</p>
              <p>Which they then swapped out a few weeks later for 8533C in the end. So effectively a SD's capacity is somewhat 1/2 of a DD? So yeah, that was I meant by 'downsized by half" because I was replying with respect to how they wanted a DD fleet add initially, but ended up settling for a SD in the end</p>

              <p>They even had DDs perm haha. Which was why LTA's response only recently about Sv 103 &amp; the DD certification issue, caught me / those who were aware of it by surprise? It was like they (LTA) suddenly wanted to dig back the old records for something they missed out and then boom, they found one</p>

              <p>103 has other DD services all along its route from Serangoon to

              <p>Hmm basically when I mean downsized by half for Sv 196, that was

              Sv 196 initially.</p>
              <p>Which they then swapped out a few weeks later for 8533C in the
              end. So effectively a SD's capacity is somewhat 1/2 of a DD? So
              yeah, that was I meant by 'downsized by half" because I was
              replying with respect to how they wanted a DD fleet add initially,

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You need to understand that you MUST not assume that a svc will always have max loading throughout the route. That's not how it works. There will always be grey areas the route will experience as it transits from one area to another. </span></p>
              <p>Given so, 120 experiences so from NBR Ter to Redhill MRT. That's the grey area that 120 has to inevitably pass due to terminal constraints. You know that yourself either. Don't underestimate the utility of 120 at that sector. Being an extremely long route 33 is fully vulnerable to delays and 120 is the solution to that. Maybe your definition of "empty buses" has got to be a real peculiar one as contrary to your statement most of 120's buses are fully seated even on non-peak times such as weekends. </p>
              <p>I'm not sure where did poor planning for 47 come from. Where would you have suggested it to go? IMHO I feel that the route was well-planned to boost connectivity between Bedok South and MP. Yes, people actl do take it between these sectors. </p>
