              <p>Before they considered the service warrant fleet adds they must first survey the loadings during off and peak hours.You need extra manpower,You must change rostering and schedules and must really considered is it worth?Cannot suka2 add here and there just because of a couple of heavy load trips.They can tweak the timings or cut 1 split to normal day bus.</p>

              <p>Service 43 capacity upgrade confirmed: Upgrade for SBS5156C (First bus from Upper East Coast terminal)</p>
              <p>SBS3446D is replacing SBS5156C.</p>
              <p>SBS7703K is still on 43.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">Service 43 is getting full far too often. Even during off-peak hours, SDs are sometimes packed to the door.</span></p>
              <p>2 DD fleet adds would be better. One of them should be S shift bus, timed at the early peak hour towards UEC (after SBS3440U slot), as SBS3440U (and SBS3003Z previously) was packed to the door before it enters YCK Road, if it was more than 5 minutes away from 43M DD in front.</p>
              <p>The other DD should be an A/P bus to help with off-peak frequency and the crowds at Paya Lebar. Anyway, I don't go to the other side of 43's route.</p>

              <p>I agree with what you said.</p>
              <p>Have you taken a look at the new temporary woodlands interchange? The parking arrangement is not only disgusting but also blatantly dangerous and against the natural flow and order of traffic.</p>
              <p>See the manner in which TWO buses park back to back in a single parking lot meant for only one bus. The front bus have to be moved forward slightly in order to accommodate a second bus in the same parking lot, although the rear bus ass still sticking out and must reverse to exit, grinding peak hour traffic behind to a halt. Thankfully it might seem they have come to their senses and have scaled back this dangerous, unusual and unpredictable practice of double parking.</p>

              <p>There's another way to look at this: SMRT Buses may have anticipated if they were to lose Seletar parcel tender as well, 40 bendy buses may be all they need for the remaining routes (especially if 858 is included in the Seletar package).</p>
              <p>If LTA refuses to take up the remaining A24s after 2022 (assuming the 3 doors concept buses did take their place), it is then up to SMRT Buses to dispose the fleet themselves.</p>
