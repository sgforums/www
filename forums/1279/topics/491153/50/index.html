              <p>Takes diff ppl w diff experiences to speak of diff truths.. I'm not gonna denounce Vampier Lim with his 386 encounter but I'll say that where I live in i.e. the East the services have generally improved, so my viewpoint will always be SBST doing a suckish job at operating the services here, and I don't think its equally fair to question me of my judgements too, insofar as you stand for the validity of other instances where SBST may be argued to prevail.</p>

              <p>That's not true at all. If anything I would say that the B9s lost to GA are at best proportionate to the services they lost also, since GA also got their DDs from BCM. </p>

              <p>All, don't assign blame so easily. There must be some instruction of higher level. As I always said, you cannot right size every trip and every bus service. As long as a basic bus service is provided to every area within 400 metres, the bus industry is still doing it right. That is their main role. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I believe SBST and LTA know that 168 is a high demand service. If they convert some of the DDs to SDs, the least they can do is to maintain the 6-10 minute frequency.</p>
              <p>I was angered by the fact that my fellow passengers and I were kept waiting for 17 minutes (with the queue extending to the next berth and beyond) and the next bus was a SD. While queuing, I saw 2 svc 168 DDs returning to Woodlands, so a shortage of bus is not an excuse.</p>
              <p>Yes, a basic bus service should be provided to every area within 400 metres. But if I have to wait very very long for the bus and many passengers are unable to board due to full buses, then the operator is not doing it right. 17 minutes is way above the official frequency of 6-12 minutes stated by SBST and LTA.</p>
