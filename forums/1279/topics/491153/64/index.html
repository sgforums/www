              <p>Hi.</p>
              <p>About svc 883’s frequency, it looks quite bad on weekends. There are only 3 SDs on service.</p>
              <p>The crowd pax level is extremely bad at Yishun that several people mostly Canberra residents couldn’t board the bus to reach home on time. I’m wondering if they should add additional 1 bus or upgrade around 2 buses to DDs or both to ease the crowd level.</p>
              <p>Weekday peak hours frequency looks fine since there are around 3-4 DDs plus SDs but I don’t think SDs are enough to handle the crowd pax level during these periods.</p>

              <p>136 badly need school hours DDs,Always see 2-3 SDs having
              trouble tanking all the students.Since GAS has excess of DDs why
              not deploy 2 for school hours/peak hours and 1 running full
              day?</p>
              <p>43 currently also doesn't warrant full DDs,Maybe can downgraded
              4 DDs to SDs.</p>
              <p>359 loadings for St 51 is extremely high during peak hours,Maybe
              deploy 2-3 DDs?</p>
              <p>Service 4 need 1 SD convert to DDs,Current 4 SDs and 2 DDs
              doesn't help during peak hours...Maybe 3 DDs and 3 SDs will be
              nice.</p>
              <p>34A can renumbered as 34M and use majority DDs... crowded from
              PGL all the way to Tampines Hub...</p>
              <p>Can use 4 DDs and 2 SDs to compliment 34..</p>

              <p>I avoid confrontation here these days but I beg to differ on svc 43.</p>
              <p>You need to see the heavy loading towards NEX in the morning on  43/43M from Buangkok Green. Most DDs have 90-110 pax on board. Some back to back ones still have around 65-70 pax. It does warrant full fleet DD. </p>
              <p>Likewise svc 70 needs more SD -&gt; DD upgrades. AM peak loading is not manageable by SDs.</p>
              <p>116 / 147 help to pick up pax along YCK Road from HG Ave 2 junction as 43/70 dont offer space for commuters. 116 these days getting quite crowded at YCK road because of this reason. </p>

              <p>still 6-7 DDs on 851.. but maybe the sequences adjusted..  too bad due to bad planning by LTA, SBST is not getting new DDs for seletar package.. in fact, they have only 2 Spare DDs (7589/5546, excluding those just transfer from SMRT which should be perm)  so most of the services does not have fleet upgrade.. guess have to wait till the Euro 6 DDs arrived. </p>

              <p>So meaning 167 got 1 perm and 1 crossover DD..</p>
              <p>And I wonder why SMRT can't even spare 2 DDs for service 167?If they're short of DDs,can request to LTA for exchange with GAS since the latter is short of SDs..</p>
