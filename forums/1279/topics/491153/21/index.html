                  Sardines? I didnt know MRT is like a sardines 24/7. U really dont have discipline or urgency seriously. The most hardcore bus enthusiasts i know are never anti-MRT. They took MRT to school to work. U know why? They freaking cared about punctuality and discipline and this bus hobby is like free time stuff. Nobody likes to be sandwiched even i dont but i never ever sacrifice my discipline n punctuality for it.

              <p>Thats was a one off thing for me. Usually I would prep enough time to take 171 to school from Yishun, like 90 minutes incl wait time.</p>
              <p>MRT wasnt very punctual either. When I started working in town, a train ride from Khatib to City Hall that was supposed to be 30 minutes usually ended up as 50 minutes. There were very frequent halts between stations from Novena and City Hall and yes, the train was packed like Sardines at all times during morning peak. Each halt would take anything from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. Even if there were no halts, the trains would run very slowly ~20km/h. Thats why I chose to take 851 when possible (and 850 was cancelled after MRT came out, otherwise I could have taken that too).</p>
              <p>Of course back then there were no Facebook to put complaints about MRT to. All complaint letters sent to SMRT would have been sent directly to the recycle bin. Complaint letters sent to ST Forum would also be selectively not published.</p>

              U long time never take MRT seriously. Everytime i took MRT during peak hours recently, they chiong the MRT. U must be damn unlucky to hop onto a train that is travelling very slowly. I have personally never experience a slow train during peak hour and yes i commute to work using MRT when i was working in Sentosa. If it is slow then one off incident only. 
              
              And i took buses to work and i regretted it. I wake up early oso no use coz of congestion at traffic lights, certain areas. I hardly took MRT but when i took MRT during peak hour, it have never ever fail to please me with their speed.

              <p>Yes I concede that MRT standard should have been improved in recent times, taking into consideration that passengers are vocal on Facebook and the gahmen is showing more wayang on its reliability. Do note that those experiences I described happened between 2000 and 2004. Way even before SMRT took over TIBS.</p>

              <p>I am married and I hold a job in a University. My wife works in a hospital. Both of us dont take the MRT and I dont have to send her to work in the car and we have no problems with it. She doesnt hate the MRT, she just dont need to take it. At our advanced age, we are already looking at retiring in 10 years time, so even if we dont wake up our idea according to your standard, no harm is done!</p>

              <p>The thing is, 859 is the ONLY bus which enters the insider areas

              service as the flats the bus service passes by are all 14-21

              <p>Go observe the loading my friend. It is strictly SD loading even if it goes to inner parts of Sembawang. 856 is the preferred choice and there is 859A/B to supplement on its high loading sector.</p>
              <p>Maybe after Sembawang Crescent flats develop, there maybe a need, but the call to upgrade should be taken when it is needed and not waste resource.</p>
              <p>962 is the one that has been poorly treated like 851 with constantly downgrading bendies and in turn having to implement 962B/C</p>
