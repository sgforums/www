            <div class='col-md body'>Straits Times, Oct 28, 2006<br><strong>Ang Mo Kio mega mall ready soon</strong><br><br>ANG Mo Kio is about four months away from having a new mega mall, a development seen to bring a new buzz to one of Singapore's oldest HDB estates.<br><br>Billed as a one-stop retail and entertainment experience, the four-storey AMK Hub with 262 shops will also be a focal point for a range of services provided by National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) cooperatives.<br><br>These include a 2,000-sq-ft lounge where the elderly can meet in air-conditioned comfort; a 4,400-sq-ft childcare centre; and an NTUC Club entertainment centre with an eight-screen cineplex.<br><br>It will also house FairPrice's first-ever hypermarket and have a mega pharmacy run by NTUC Healthcare, the labour movement's health-care arm<br><br>At least 90 per cent of floor space in the $340 million mall has already been taken up by the NTUC cooperatives and stores ranging from fashion and apparel outlets to banks, cafes and eateries.<br><br>The 19.3ha complex will also be connected to an air-conditioned bus interchange, slated for completion early next year, and an underpass to Ang Mo Kio MRT station.<br><br>Speaking at the mall's topping-off ceremony yesterday NTUC secretary-general Lim Boon Heng said its completion - hopefully in time for Chinese New Year - will complement the rejuvenation of Ang Mo Kio town centre.<br><br>'By having a seamless linkage with the upcoming air-conditioned bus interchange and the underpass to Ang Mo Kio MRT station, the one-stop AMK Hub will also provide greater convenience and accessibility to the contemporary family needs of residents within and beyond Ang Mo Kio,' he said.<br><br>Mr Lim believes that with a catchment of some 780,000 residents in Ang Mo Kio and nearby estates in Bishan, Hougang, Serangoon and Toa Payoh, the mall will become a 'buzzing focal point' for young and old alike.<br><br>It was a view shared by Mr Seng Han Thong, MP for Yio Chu Kang, who is NTUC assistant secretary-general.<br><br>'We foresee that with the completion of AMK Hub, the town centre will be even more vibrant,' he said.<br><br>'The mall will attract shoppers from not just Ang Mo Kio, but other parts of Singapore as well.'<br><br>Mr Lim also saw the mall's development as reflecting what NTUC spelt out in its Labour Movement 2011 vision for the next five years to serve workers at all levels - from low-income contract workers to executives.<br><br>'The AMK Hub development is in line with an exciting phase for the labour movement,' said Mr Lim, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.<br><br>Construction of the mall began last year, and when it opens next year it is expected to generate 1,500 jobs.<br><br>Dr Chua Yang Liang, head of research at property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle's office here, said the mall will benefit from the large human traffic flow.<br><br>'Such a development will complement the surrounding retail landscape, providing residents and businesses alike with a wider choice of retail opportunities,' he said.<br><br>However, Mr Goh Ang Jee who heads an association of neighbourhood shops was less certain.<br><br>'We are only small-scale retailers, so it'll be very difficult to compete against such a new large-scale and air-conditioned mall,' said Mr Goh, who runs a furniture shop in the area.<br><br>To cope with the competition, he plans to get shop owners to put their goods on sale more often, and organise stage activities during festive seasons to draw more shoppers.<br><br>Ultimately, consumers such as administration officer Jessie Quek, 49, are the ones who stand to benefit.<br><br>'We have waited so long for this,' said Madam Quek, who lives a five-minute walk away from the mall. 'Ang Mo Kio Central used to be filled with activity until the old bus interchange was demolished some years ago.'<br><br>'We are more than happy to have the bustle back.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 Singapore Press Holdings.
