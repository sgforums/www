            <div class='col-md body'>I know why the driver acted this way.<br><br>I've seen people anyhow tap the card when boarding the bus. Error tone they also don't care. But when they alight, the reader will appear "BOARD FROM ENTRANCE" or some messages like that. They go to the front, tap, go to the exit, tap and alight. This way, they only pay 63 cents.<br><br>Somehow the driver is doing it for the good cause. Too bad he's done it in a wrong manner.</div>

However, the first two drivers refused to let her board, one of them even told her off, saying things like "If everyone like you say no money and let you board for free, i have to let everyone do the same.." or something like that.<br><br>However, the third driver was kind enough to let her board.

Not trying to interfere, but I have experienced this situation a few times already, also on Dunearn Rd. The bus driver also insisted that I tap the card a few times, although always got Entry OK reading. The EZ-link software has some bugs to start with, and sometimes, the driver receive the wrong output from the reader, and it always happen in the morning on service 852. Sometimes, there is no beep but the Entry Ok is displayed immediately, so the driver have to check and this sometimes cause a 5 minute delay in the morning at worst.<br><br>Sorry for criticising like this, but you may want to know that Dunearn Road is a very stressful road to be in, and there are a lot of " si ren bai lei" of rich people who think they own the whole bus when they board it. There are quite a few, to say the least, and they just waltzed into the bus, not paying fares and the driver also helpless, or they kanna complain for their "service" when they are in fact doing their job. In this service industry, the commuter may be in the wrong, but for some reasons, the company is forced to penalise the driver just to appease the customer for fear that he blows it big to LTA or the ST Forum.<br><br>Furthermore, Bus drivers will kanna when the inspectors find that they do not tap the card, and believe me, the drivers do get marked down. Thus I think its Zilchster bad luck that he got a driver with such a bad mood that day, but I have met many more worse drivers than this. Well, isn't it so good if we just forget about such incident and try to remain cheerful cos there are so much more things to worry about <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
