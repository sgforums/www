Not trying to interfere, but I have experienced this situation a few times already, also on Dunearn Rd. The bus driver also insisted that I tap the card a few times, although always got Entry OK reading. The EZ-link software has some bugs to start with, and sometimes, the driver receive the wrong output from the reader, and it always happen in the morning on service 852. Sometimes, there is no beep but the Entry Ok is displayed immediately, so the driver have to check and this sometimes cause a 5 minute delay in the morning at worst.<br><br>Sorry for criticising like this, but you may want to know that Dunearn Road is a very stressful road to be in, and there are a lot of " si ren bai lei" of rich people who think they own the whole bus when they board it. There are quite a few, to say the least, and they just waltzed into the bus, not paying fares and the driver also helpless, or they kanna complain for their "service" when they are in fact doing their job. In this service industry, the commuter may be in the wrong, but for some reasons, the company is forced to penalise the driver just to appease the customer for fear that he blows it big to LTA or the ST Forum.<br><br>Furthermore, Bus drivers will kanna when the inspectors find that they do not tap the card, and believe me, the drivers do get marked down. Thus I think its Zilchster bad luck that he got a driver with such a bad mood that day, but I have met many more worse drivers than this. Well, isn't it so good if we just forget about such incident and try to remain cheerful cos there are so much more things to worry about <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>I had a very bad exprience in a 145 DM 0405.I forgot to tap the ez-link card and the driver scolded me and so i taped my ez-link card when I walked away,i heard him muttering:"wang ba".</div>
