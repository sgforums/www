              <p>I think we have some issues about Wikipedia which needs to be ironed out:</p>
              <p>1) WAB services<br>2) Euro 3, 4 and 5<br>3) Premium Services.<br>4) References</p>
              <p>To people who edit Wikipedia:<br><br>1) Is there a need to put WAB sign for all services which have B9TLs, K230UBs, OC500LE even though some of them have not been certified? Doing so would cause confusion. You do need to know that people using Wikipedia may not be bus fans, who knows they may even be wheelchair bound people and they may think that some services are WAB services even though they have not been certified. Furthermore, some services with the wheelchair sign beside them only got one or two cameos or hasn't used WABs for a long time.</p>
              <p>2) Euro 3, 4 and 5: Again, is there a need to put these info? Do you think people care about what buses SBST and SMRT use on their services. Also, if you put Euro 3, 4 and 5, why not also put Euro 1 and 2 and pre-Euro in (I'm sarcastic here in case you don't know). Put it bluntly, its trying to tell people that we are new into higher emission standards. Throw face only.</p>
              <p>3) Again, is there a need to put in premium services which don't start service from the interchange or terminal when the article is about services in the interchange or terminal. Yes, we do know that SBST's website does put the interchange/terminal where the buses are despatched from, but this again leads to confusion. Also, some premium service (especially SMRT ones) aren't even despatched from the interchanges, even though they serve the town. There is simply no need for such info to be included in the interchanges' pages.</p>
              <p>4) For the references portion of interchange pages, is there a need to put in ALL press releases for services starting from an interchange even though there is no mention about the press releases in the article. Some of the press releases have little importance to the article at all, for example, road diversions.</p>

              <p><br>I originally added the above portion in the article on SMRT Buses as</p>
              <p>"In 2008, SMRT Buses initiated a fleet replacement to replace the retiring Nissan Diesel buses with <strong>132</strong> <a title="Mercedes-Benz OC500LE" href="/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_OC500LE"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Mercedes-Benz OC500LE</span></a> wheelchair accessible buses. At least 30 of them are now on revenue service and more being bodied up and readied for revenue service."</p>
              <p>Can go check the history page to verify.</p>
              <p>edit - now it makes sense, i remember seeing one fotopic's description saying about OC500LE replacing Nissan Diesel buses and the L113 buses due to customer feedback.</p>
              <p>It seemed that no one is updating the facts @ SMRT Buses page.</p>
              <p>And also don't know why somebody go itchy hand go edit it with wrong info.</p>
              <p>Also, the bus fleet table - make it more clear ba. if really editing it.</p>

              <p>The thing is, those placed inside the articles have no relation to the articles. There are press releases for road diversions when the article doesn't even mention road diversion (which in some pages, road diversion notices constitute for ALL the press releases), furthermore, such press releases in general have little relationships with the articles themselves.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, let me tell you what I've edited in the Wikipedia pages of SBS Transit (including its bus routes in SIngapore)<br><br>1. Service 115 is still around, and some people had edited Service 115 as "withdrawn" on 11 Aug 2008. (Originally Service 115 was scheduled to be withdrawn on that day but it didn't)<br><br>2. In the Former routes of the Bus routes in Singapore page, some other people also think that feeders like 801, 802, 803, 805 are fully air-conditioned. That's rather untrue indeed. When those services were integrated to form Services 811 and 812 in 1996, those feeders were NAC at that time, since when AC buses are deployed on those services 801, 802, 803 &amp; 805?<br>3. Missing withdrawal information like 352 &amp; 356 wasn't on the list of former routes, those withdrawn services should be added as well, although they are being integrated to form 357 and then merged with 294 to form Service 3.<br>4. Now coming to the SBS Teansit pages, I have just edited the current bus fleet part and yet some itchy hands try to re-edit the part like Dennis Trident is WAB, etc, etc. Some buses like Mercedes Benz O405G (should know what I'm referring to) is no longer part of the SBST fleet, and yet someone say Mercedes Benz O405G is still around in SBST.<br></div>

                  Just a small correction on the history section of Service 143...<br>It was believed that this service was around in the late 1960s. Service 143, used to ply between Toa Payoh to Jurong Rd 10 ms Market, belonged to a financial troubled bus company, STC in the early days. When STC closed down in 1971, several bus services including 143 goes to ABS, ABC &amp; UBS. Service 143 belongs to ABS before it merges to SBS in 1973.<br><br>Second, the former Jurong Depot at penjuru Rd was never being opened in 1976, neither was it introduced in 1976, but somewhere in 1981, the route of 143 was amended to Penjuru Rd (Jurong Depot), according to the bus guides published in the 1970s to the 1980s.

              <p>It should be a bus park.</p>
              <p>We used to have a Jurong bus park at Penjuru (known as Jurong depot much earlier before) and Jurong bus park at Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim when they were merge with Bukit Batok Depot under a single management.</p>
              <p>We used to have an index on our schedule located just above each trip. bbdep/arbp/jrbp "sw" (SBS West). amdep, bram with "sc" (SBS Central). hgdep, bndep with "se" (SBS East).</p>
              <p>Since when did hgdep come under west district? Strange isn't it? It is located somewhere in the northeast, but comes under west. Also one of my kaki who drives service 70 told me that amdep is under east district. It used to be central district with brbp.</p>

              <p><br>East district (hgdep) closed down somewhere in early 2004. Hence, Central took over East i.e. bndep and hgdep. Since the new east district is too big, they have to give one of the 2 bus depot of the old east district to the west. That bus depot is hgdep.</p>
