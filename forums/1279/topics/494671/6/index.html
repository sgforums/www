              <p>I understand your concern. I also think that the current
              infrastructure and planning is not able to allow every bus route
              use bendy buses to ply the Changi Airport basement car park.</p>
              <p>Regarding this point, the solution is to not allow buses to stop
              at the Changi Airport basement car park for too long. Instead, let
              the buses call at bus stops for only a few minutes and go off.</p>
              <p>Because from my observations, the car park road space is wide
              enough. The only issue is that many buses stop at the car park for
              too long, and there are bus drivers that park their bus at the side
              of the road and take a break at their office. It could be due to
              this that the Changi Airport basement car park seem to not have
              enough space for every bus route to use bendy buses, and only bus
              route 858 uses bendy buses.</p>
              <p>If we change the current operating model to an arrangement
              similar to an average bus stop, where buses just stop for a few
              minutes then go, I believe the basement car park would probably not
              have traffic congestion issue, and every bus route can use bendy
              buses to enter the Changi Airport basement car park to serve
              passengers.</p>
              <p>Of course, I understand that there are bus routes that originate
              at the Changi Airport basement car park. Then change the routing
              lor, by extending those bus routes to originate at surrounding bus
              terminals. For example, bus route 36 can be extended to Changi
              Business Park or Tampines Concourse, instead of originating at the
              Changi Airport basement carpark.</p>
              <p>This way, the roads would probably be wider a bit, and every bus
              route could use bendy buses to meet the demand for high
              capacity.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, someone can raise this suggestion to the authorities,
              and not just let this be an online discussion topic only.</p>

              <p>Pity you spent so long trying to translate a pointless post into some broken Chinese.. You totally don't get my concern LOL. It's not just T2 that's the problem. Every single terminal, even if just a bus stop which they are now, gets clogged from the security checks to the tiny parking berths and passageways. The basement was designed to handle ground passengers from decades ago — which has increased exponentially due to more retail and F&amp;B in public areas, an increase in ground staff as CGA grows, and of course the rise of LCC which meant more cost-conscious travellers who wanna ditch the cab.</p>

              <p>I think they should. Now that a few units are transferred to SBST and drivers are training, LTA should buy more A24s. I think a fleet of 100 should give good economics of scale in terms of maintenance and spare parts and also serve the areas where bendys are needed. I think the purchase shld be done early next year or Dec 2017 when the Batch 1 O405Gs deregister.</p>

              <p>Agreed..Maybe 140 including the SMB ones in SG is enough..Use it for shorter distance high loading feeders and Airport svc only..No need for CBD or mid/long trunk</p>

              <p>With the recent developments happening with 858 and 110 in CGA I CANNOT EMPHASISE MORE for the need for the procurement of extra bendies to kick out them rigids! Esp with those Shitaros filling up!</p>
              <p>Those who keep saying SG no need bendies whatsoever clearly are living in their IVORY TOWERS and have no idea the situation on the ground! Poor folks crammed into squeezy Shitaros that are constantly delayed due to bunching, as a result of the need to spam buses due to the shitaro's puny capacity! You say bendies add to congestion — the real cause of congestion are spammed rigids clogging up security checks, bus bays! Coz now, you need two buses to clear instead of a big bus one shot!</p>
              <p>And it's an absolute FALLACY that there is insufficient land space for bendies, particularly for depots, because now depots are built UNDERGROUND and are MULTI STOREY, giving ample provision for more bendy buses! The newest development, aka the East Coast integrated transportation complex, is (coincidentally?) 10 min away from CGA, and 5 min away from T5, making it perfect for CGA svcs!</p>
              <p>Those who thinks SG cannot accommodate new bendies need to <strong>WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE</strong>! Face it, CAAS ain't gonna change current PTB arrangements for buses! Face it, CGA has infra for more bendies, as seen in the design of long and wide roads for buses in T4! Face it, SMRT is refusing to switch back to the A22! And face it, new developments have made space a non issue!</p>
              <p>The only reason ppl will still complain despite such truths is because they are salty of buses blocking their way when they drive their nice cars on the road! Hello, not everyone can drive like you.. so get off your high horses and spare a thought!</p>

              <p>With the recent developments happening with 858 and 110 in CGA I
              CANNOT EMPHASISE MORE for the need for the procurement of extra
              bendies to kick out them rigids! Esp with those Shitaros filling
              up!</p>
              <p>Those who keep saying SG no need bendies whatsoever clearly are
              living in their IVORY TOWERS and have no idea the situation on the
              ground! Poor folks crammed into squeezy Shitaros that are
              constantly delayed due to bunching, as a result of the need to spam
              buses due to the shitaro's puny capacity! You say bendies add to
              congestion — the real cause of congestion are spammed rigids
              clogging up security checks, bus bays! Coz now, you need two buses
              to clear instead of a big bus one shot!</p>
              <p>And it's an absolute FALLACY that there is insufficient land
              space for bendies, particularly for depots, because now depots are

              <p>the 50 hybrids is most likely to be just one of the purchases made by LTA. they might expand the PO to include more hybrids and some rigids, DDs and bendies (for CGA bound svcs and some feeders)</p>

              <p>How many times do I have to tell the bus lobbyists to be careful
                  about what they wished for?</p>
              <p>Every new bus was great because it was in a brand new condition.
                  The party period of brand new buses frequently being registered and
                  pushed into service is ending soon.</p>
              <p>So how are the lobbyists going to manage with that? Are they
                  encouraging "fleet mixing" in small quantities to create the
                  potential of more cameos?</p>

              <p>I should also say that a huge number of B9TLs and Scania K230UBs are already midway through their lifespans. I believe you all would agree with me that time do fly fast since the first time I know of them.</p>
