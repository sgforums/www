              <p>When downline opens later this month service 61 might get lesser
              passengers as this routes heavily duplicates dtl from eunos to city
              area. More O405Gs are on verge of retiring and a portion of A24s
              will be or already transferred to SBSt for seletar package.</p>

              <p>How come A24 being transferred to SBST? LTA trying the use of Bendy buses for the Seletar bus package ah... I thot both SBST and LTA were against those buses?</p>
              <p>But if SBST is really taking in MAN A24s for use at seletar, I think LTA should buy more A24s. Atleast 40-60 units to support CGA and feeder services for selected towns (more than just Woodlands/CCK.) 806 was defintiely doing better with bendy. I saw a few DD plying 806 before... lower deck so packed, upper deck sparsely populated.</p>
              <p>I guess the MAN A24s in Seletar bus package can be used for the Yishun Feeders and CGA Service 24.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, I will strongly hope that the remaining old bendies (1148 onwards) from AMDEP go over to KJDEP for 184/300/302 fleet once Yishun services go over to Seletar. AMDEP doesn't really need the bendies anymore for their remaining services by then.</p>
              <p>I really hate the way SMRT still mass deploy the NWAB bendies to 854 compare to most other WAB trunks that are using majority DDs. I will want SMRT to concentrate putting in more WAB DDs on 854 to replace every single old bendy especially during weekday peak hours.</p>
              <p>But 1 good thing I notice about 854 fleet is that night time usually left with only WAB fleets running, all the NWAB bendies seems to operate on S-shifts only. For weekends, the DDs normally appear twice to 3x the number of NWAB bendies seen.</p>
              <p>There are still several NWAB bendies running on Yishun feeders btw.</p>

              <p>61 used to have several bendies in its fleet since Tibs takeover. But somewhere in 2012, the bendies were mass withdrawn from 61 and replaced with the SMB rigids just before it turned WAB. I think there were 2 bendies left on 61 then - TIB1131G and another one.</p>

That's why I feel that although 24 has a chance to use the MAN A24s, they might be more for the yishun feeders. Given the crafting of the Yishun contract and the services involved, LTA would have well-known that there would be no need for so many bendy lots if yishun feeders were shifting to DDs under the contract. I guess LTA still did force a tryout of DDs on 806 but maybe results were not too positive so bendys are transferred to SBST for use on yishun feeders. </p>

              <p>So these A24 units will be painted lush green SGâ�¤BUS Livery? I believe for seletar contract, only a portion is transferred from SMRT and LTA will still purchase some new units for SBST. Doesnt make sense for SMRT to transfer WAB bendy to SBST and deploy NWAB bendy on woodlands/CCK feeders. On the other hand,  it also doesn't make sense for SBST to maintain such a small number of A24s at seletar.</p>

              <p>I think the contract would have indicated that the winner has to operate A24s as part of the package but may not have specified on which services. As long as there are A24s to be maintained, it would probably make more economic sense to maintain a fleet of atleast 15-20. Although A22 and A24 may have similar builder, there are surely parts that are different. Most obvious is the articulator.</p>
              <p>I believe the DDs on 806 was a real test to see how the DDs fair on the yishun feeders. If not, why did LTA not choose to debut DDs on the other feeders and even if not immediately, in the last 3 months? ATM, SMRT is definitely able to spare some DDs on these services especially since the handover exercise is quite soon.</p>
              <p>There could be a possibility that these 3 units are transferred to SBST for training and LTA may have placed a small order for A24s, which can still be delivered in the upcoming 3-4 months.</p>

              would probably make more economic sense to maintain a fleet of
              atleast 15-20. Although A22 and A24 may have similar builder, there
              are surely parts that are different. Most obvious is the
              articulator.</p>
              <p>I believe the DDs on 806 was a real test to see how the DDs fair
              on the yishun feeders. If not, why did LTA not choose to debut DDs
              on the other feeders and even if not immediately, in the last 3
              months? ATM, SMRT is definitely able to spare some DDs on these
              services especially since the handover exercise is quite soon.</p>
              <p>There could be a possibility that these 3 units are transferred
              to SBST for training and LTA may have placed a small order for
              A24s, which can still be delivered in the upcoming 3-4 months.</p>

              <p>i do not have the contract and thus i am not sure whether LTA have specific which services get what.. but most likely it will be for sv24.....</p>
              <p>as for DDs for other yishun feeders, there are still around 150 NWAB bendies running around.. which services do you want to put these bendies on? ppl are already not happy with a few NWAB bendies on 854.... </p>
              <p>even since BCM, both SMRT/SBST have been using their old buses way up to the official lifespan (except for few problematic buses which are layup earlier)  as LTA are paying them the leasing cost for these old buses.. </p>
              <p>806 gotten DDs because of the WAB status and not enough A24 to deploy.</p>
              <p>Even sv851 only manage to get upgrade to DDs fleet in the last month.....  so the rest of the yishun feeders most likely will wait until End Dec (when another 50 or so bendies are deregistered) to get DDs. </p>
