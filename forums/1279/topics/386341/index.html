              <p>Notice that between SBST and SMRT, there's only one lone China bus. They aren't replacing European makes with China buses.</p>
              <p>And solid European makes don't mean shit if you body them with crappy bodyworks *ahem*. </p>
              <p>And you want to know reliability? Buses in the rural provinces of China are usually god-knows-how-many-donkey-years old. And they still run. Sure they don't look too good, but they still work.</p>

              <p>By the way, the ark in the movie was made with the money of those who have purchased tickets. If max has even bothered to pay more attention, most of those who paid for them did not get aboard. Definitely the ark was reliable, but in all honesty who would trust media-tainted crap, and a fiction at that? That is 1 point for effort in actually giving an example, but 0 points for reliability of the source.</p>
              <p>We all have many grievances when it comes to PRCs lah. Go look up the words "dog, slaughter, china, meat", and you will get a handful of videos showing how those motherfuckers stab those helpless, caged animals to death.</p>

              <p>I never see SBS got China bus but SMRT (SMLJ) has. PS: I heard that these are still using European materials. So next time Singapore should by European parts and assemble locally, creating jobs.</p>

              <p>The safety of a bus is only as good as the bodybuilder.</p>
              <p>To keep things simple, while there are safety systems in place, a bus simply does not have as many safety systems as a car would.  Overwhelming demand and scrutiny has meant that passenger (and now pedestrian) safety in cars is always closely monitored.</p>
              <p>Personally, I would hate to see what would happen to the passengers located in the low-floor section of a bus in the event of a side-on 'T-bone' accident.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>
