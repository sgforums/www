            <div class='col-md body'>I won't consider those Nice2 as 2-storey, as the lower floor is of standing height only for small children, not regular adults !<br><br>Nice 2 entire fleet i'll say is '1.5' storeys coach, where the overall height is only slightly higher than a high-deck single decker coach.<br><br>For true double-decker in more recent times in Malaysia , i'll consider those used with MAN 24.460 chassi with 3-axles. Both floors are of adult standing height here.<br><br>I believe why double-deckers didn't catch on in Malaysia was because of the sceptism from some people in Malaysia then that the (likely mostly British) double-deckers had inferior road handling capabilities compared to single deckers, something which i do believe is still the case with modern double-deckers, simply due to their higher c.g. over single deckers. Of course in the double-deckers of today, these have greatly improved active safety margins with the increasing use of electronic air-suspension control, ABS, ASR etc. which i won't expect to find in a Leyland Atlantean !!<br><br>So slowly now you see the re-emergence of the double-decker in Malaysia. although so far not yet in citybus operations again. With better buses available today, i won't rule out KL having double-decker citybuses again, with MAN being a probable choice.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">As mentioned earlier, KL had DDs in the 1950s which were similar to the Routemasters.

But it's not a DD, though. Other DD coaches are all 2-axle chassii, probably with the same configuration as the Nice 2 coaches. There are Scania, MAN and even a Japanese model.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about a Japanese 3-axle chassis, i ever seen 1 in KL but it's from Thailand. From a distance @ night i thought it was a M-B O 404 DD because the coachwork seemed a close copy of the real M-B double-decker coach, down to the O 404's front grill with M-B star logo &amp; 'O 404 DD' side plate &amp; 3-element front headlamp, rear high &amp; low lampsets &amp; Setra-like rear-view mirrors but the giveaway was the wheel-hub design, steering-wheel &amp; dashboard which confirmed to me it's only a Nissan Diesel chassis in 6x2 form.<br><br>I've been told that Thailand is full of fake buses/coaches especially M-B so this in hindsight came as no surprise afterall !<br><br>I believe this type of Nissan Diesel 3-axle can also be seen in Singapore occasionally, driven from Thailand. For 2-axle i've not seen any Japanese makes with double-deck body.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">The only other 3-axle chassis is the MAN 24.370 used by the Transnasional Executive Coach.
