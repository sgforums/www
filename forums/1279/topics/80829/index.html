That's why when I was at this bus stop, I always have to be observant as I have to make sure the bus captain saw me flagging for the bus before the bus enters the carpark. But there could be a problem at night.<br><br>I couldn't understand why a bus stop is built there and there was no bus stop at the opposite side.

(crew layover on bus)</div></blockquote>CLOB just means that the crew change over by changing the bus only  when their shift ended ie they take over the bus, The weird modus operandi of this svc means that bus captains change at weird hours. Quite a few buses actually terminate at PTB 2 and shut off the engine and lights after the bus captain asks the pax to board the bus in front. This is also why svc 36 has 3 berths ( 2 near to entrance, 1 at side nearer to corporate entrance ) . Obviously you havent seen 4 svc 36 mk5s parked at the basement b4, with 4 buses remaining there for quite some time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Quite a few buses actually terminate at PTB 2 and shut off the engine and lights after the bus captain asks the pax to board the bus in front. This is also why svc 36 has 3 berths ( 2 near to entrance, 1 at side nearer to corporate entrance ) . Obviously you havent seen 4 svc 36 mk5s parked at the basement b4, with 4 buses remaining there for quite some time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Not all the time. The number of times I took Sv. 36 I wasn't chased down at PTB2, the driver just swapped after 5 mins.</div>
