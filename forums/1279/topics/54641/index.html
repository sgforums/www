Definitely not 4.5m.

Anyway, I have to go to Tampines Interchange to take 969 home what, and I was waiting for TIB1205 to come out when I saw that single barricade with a small green plastic plate tied to it besides the berth. I got curious n i thought it was svc 39 ( Makes sense to put it directly besides its rival ), but it turned out to be svc 68. Then i saw the notice announcing the swapping of berths, and the service 68 number printed on white paper and stuck on top of the service 39 number....svc 68 is so damn pitiful...Mk IIIs leaving the interchange with no pax and return with only 5 pax during evening peak</div>

What you mean Mk IIIs, there is only one pathetic 700P for Sv. 68, I boarded it once for joyride, noone boarded till Industrial area, and even then there were like only 5 passengers.</div>

You must know that although Yishun Interchange has high pax traffic, most of the pax come from the nest few bus stops, but im not insulting ur intelligence whatsoever.<br><br>Its always the case when new services are introduced. For example, look at how long svc 857 and 965 took before it had sufficient pax. My classmate, FYI, does not know 969 goes to Tampines via the expressway, or 965 goes to Sengkang, though they had been introduced for quite some time already. Anyway, the number of pax on svc 39 was more that that of service 161 that was introduced 1 year ago.</div>
