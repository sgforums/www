You must know that although Yishun Interchange has high pax traffic, most of the pax come from the nest few bus stops, but im not insulting ur intelligence whatsoever.<br><br>Its always the case when new services are introduced. For example, look at how long svc 857 and 965 took before it had sufficient pax. My classmate, FYI, does not know 969 goes to Tampines via the expressway, or 965 goes to Sengkang, though they had been introduced for quite some time already. Anyway, the number of pax on svc 39 was more that that of service 161 that was introduced 1 year ago.</div></blockquote>I did my observation at the 2nd bus stop after Yishun Interchange (bus stop at blk 608 ). Only 2 more bus stops before the route leaves the Yishun boundary.<br><br>Maybe there could have been a higher load in the hours earlier than 9am. Dont know. Never bothered to wake up that early just to snoop at buses.<br><br>Yes people will take time to "notice" new services. But it should be better in a week's time since the potential 39 crowd is quite confined to the Loyang area. Once a few people there know, word of mouth within the industrial area should gather enough ridership relatively quickly. Even 857 had almost all seats filled going to YCK road barely 2 weeks into service although it was still quite empty when it goes up on CTE in the mornings until a few months later.</div>

Agreed, Sv. 39 serves Pasir Ris residents and Yishunites wanting to go to Pasir Ris. For them to go to Tampines Sv. 969 is MUCH, MUCH faster. Time saved is half an hour at least.</div>

Hope you have an enjoyable time here.<br><br>I think that is possible, but it would be more effective it it passes through Yishun Ring Road, esp the bus stops in the Blk300+ areas. This would provide immediate competition to the private bus service that currently runs from that bus stop to Changi Airport Cargo Cmplx.</div>

Possibility of it being 789J, that fella seems to be perm on Sv. 65, recently transferred from HGDEP to BNDEP(and from Sv. 156). 3-axle VOs can manouver along Telok Paku Rd, remember AA2002? I know a good spotting place next to Runway 20R, but it is relatively inaccessible and you have to walk about a kilometer into the area.</div>

But note that 30 minutes is spend between Tampines interchange and Pasir Ris Dr 12, while the rest 18 minutes is spend on the expressways, Lentor Ave and Yishun Ave 2.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I would say around 25 minutes are spent from Tampines Int to TPE, while the remainder 23 is from Yishun Int to Pasir Ris Drive 12. I'd still take Sv. 969 IF I were a Yishunite wanting to go to Tampines, journey is about half the time!</div>
