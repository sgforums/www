              <p>I visited Tampines Concourse Interchange yesterday. It is a

              <p>Observed both svc 18 and 39 left Concourse with 02-04 pax only!
              129 had 08-10 pax board at both timings observed. </p>
              <p>Looks like Tampines Concourse serves more as a terminal to park

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you finally hit the nail in the coffin. This goes to prove what I have always been saying is true. Nobody will want to walk a distance to take a bus service. Everybody prefers doorstep service. People will rather take a bus to transfer to another even if it is just 1 bus stop away. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>No. Not even for 129. </p>
              <p>There is an obvious reason why 129 is routed the way it is. It passes by all the major key places and transit stops in central Tampines just so that nobody has to take the sweltering walk to TC Int.

              <p>The reason why 129 got ppl walk during initial stages is Coz they aren't familiar with where it plies. So play safe go Int. Trust me once they see for themselves where 129 actl pass by the berth at TC will be as good as for deco.</p>

              <p>After observing Tampines Concourse Interchange, it further makes sense to have new services start from Tampines Interchange, especially those that won't ply near the MRT. My initial understanding was that there would be an automated traveletor between Tampines MRT and Concourse like the one at Serangoon connecting NEL and CCL. But given the long walk, no one's going to do it.</p>

              <p>Seeing the difficulty in MRT transfer at Tampines when DTL3 opens, it could be a good idea to introduce more bridging bus services.</p>
              <p>Currently there's 15 doing Tampines West (MRT) -- Pasir Ris, 5 doing Tampines West -- Simei, 9/38 on Tampines East -- Simei and 12/17/21/39/81 for Tampines East -- Pasir Ris. Pasir Ris west is linked to DTL by 3/39/81, which are all rather undirect.</p>
              <p>Hope that 68 (or some other new / modified service) could do Tampines (at DTL side) -- Pasir Ris west and central.</p>

              services.</p>
              <p>Currently there's 15 doing Tampines West (MRT) -- Pasir Ris, 5
              doing Tampines West -- Simei, 9/38 on Tampines East -- Simei and
              12/17/21/39/81 for Tampines East -- Pasir Ris. Pasir Ris west is
              linked to DTL by 3/39/81, which are all rather undirect.</p>
              <p>Hope that 68 (or some other new / modified service) could do
              Tampines (at DTL side) -- Pasir Ris west and central.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Actually Tampines town is quite well connected to DTL3 especially with launch of 46, 118, 129. </p>
              <p>Pasir Ris East is connected via svc 3, 17, 21, 39, 81 - good enough already.</p>
              <p>Tampines Ave  9 / st 45 could have better connection to Tampines East MRT since 293 is uni-directional. That's where I had previously proposed svc 46 to be extended via Ave 7, st 32, 34, 45, Ave 9 and back to Ave 7.</p>
              <p>Pasir Ris St 52/Interchange has svc 15 as you rightly pointed out.</p>
              <p>So it seems svc 68 would be the one that will connect Pasir Ris West to DTL3 at Tampines. It would have been better IMO if it had connected directly to Tampines West DTL3 rather than overcrowded Tampines Hub. Svc 46 also could have been possibly extended via ave 5, ave 6, Tampines North, ave 10 to Pasir Ris West / Int. </p>

              <p>After observing Tampines Concourse Interchange, it further makes
              sense to have new services start from Tampines Interchange,
              especially those that won't ply near the MRT. My initial
              understanding was that there would be an automated traveletor
              between Tampines MRT and Concourse like the one at Serangoon
              connecting NEL and CCL. But given the long walk, no one's going to

              <p>Hi mr orange28, Sengkang main interchange currently still has space to squeeze in a feeder bus service if they want to and there is also available boarding berth. There is certainly no need to reduce two bus services going into Sengkang main interchange just to have a new feeder. The situation is not like the super overcrowded tampines which has added 4, 20, etc over the years. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I suspect that 965 will remain as a pseudo-loop service and so
                  will continue to stop at the existing Sengkang Bus Int. If 965 gets
                  shifted to the Compassvale Int I would expect many people to be
                  unhappy with such a change, even if the walk to Compassvale Int is
                  shorter than the walk to Tamp. Concourse Int ...</p>
              <p>Net change is reduction of two bus services into Sengkang Int,
                  which may then make space for a new service (feeder), almost like
                  the situation in Tampines with service 127 ...</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, Sengkang main interchange currently still has
              space to squeeze in a feeder bus service if they want to and there
              is also available boarding berth. There is certainly no need to
              reduce two bus services going into Sengkang main interchange just
              to have a new feeder. The situation is not like the super
              overcrowded tampines which has added 4, 20, etc over the years.
              Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>At this point in time, probably just spectulation bah. I do think that eventually when Buangkok Int is opened in future then Compassvale Int will be closed down but this is just my spectulation. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr azharjj, the Sengkang extension and buangkok bus interchange are independent of each other and both will function separately. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I think 156/159 both should move since they have bus stop right outside Sengkang MRT as well. These two should go for sure.</p>
              <p>80/87/163 has quite a bit of people taking for 2-3 stops as a feeder from Sengkang, hence I don't think it's a good idea to move any of these services.</p>
              <p>372 could also be moved since it has stop outside Sengkang MRT, but given that it is feeder, chances can be slim, but wouldn't be a bad move.</p>
