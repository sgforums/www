              <p>don't think we should expect 1 new svc to be introduced since there are already buses parking at the entrance and exit of current int, but was wondering whether if they build a bus stop right outside the temp int just like hougang int, i don't think it would be a huge problem. just that if that ever happens which would also be somehow impossible, there better be a bus bay for the bus stop.</p>

With about 1 page each month on miscellaneous topic, I would expect about 41 pages to be filled up by December 2018.</p>
                                                                                          
                                                                                          <p>2019 will see the opening of three new bus interchanges - Yishun, Woodlands and Jurong East - as they return to their original locations. The MRT Cross Island Line stations will be announced that year, and we can expect quite a robust debate about the CRL depots, and also the potential integrated transport hubs that could be built along with the CRL (eg. Hougang and Punggol). Towards the end of the year, Gali Batu Bus Terminal will open, and we can expect quite a meaningful discussion about it.</p>

By then, we will be talking about other things, such as the introduction of autonomous buses, and other forms of future technology.</p>

                          <p>I foresee 10 integrated transport hubs to be created in the long and longer term (2027-2031: Bukit Batok, Bukit Merah, Punggol, Tampines, Tampines North. Longer term: Bishan, Buona Vista, Eunos, Seletar, Sembawang), but that's around 2030 and beyond, and they would probably announce them at around 2025 and beyond; 2 years after the fourth thread is created. I'm not sure if the fourth thread can last this long, with limited development on bus interchange, terminal and depot.</p>
                          
                          
                                                                                          <p>Anyway, this is my forecast on the discussions about bus interchange, terminal and depot.</p>

              <p>Don't worry. I am not going to create the next thread.</p>
                                                          
                                                          <p>Rest assured. I just want to end this thread with an outlook on the future developments pertaining to bus interchanges, terminals and depots.</p>
                                                  
                                                  <p>Let this be the first thread where we <strong>anticipate future</strong> at the last page, to <strong>stay relevant</strong> at the next thread.</p>
                                              
                                              <p>I am not hungry for recognition, or for the first photos or videos of new bus or train. I don't chase all that, because that's not what bus spotting is about, or train spotting for that matter.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Anyway, moving on, we can expect the following GCM depots to be announced,</p>
                                          <p>2017: Sembawang-Yishun</p>
                                          <p>2018: Sengkang-Hougang</p>
                                          <p>2020: Bedok, Choa Chu Kang, Woodlands</p>
                                          <p>2021: Tampines, Jurong West</p>
                                          <p>2022: Serangoon-Eunos, Clementi</p>
                                          <p>2023: Bishan-Toa Payoh</p>
                                          
                                          <p>This is because each GCM depot takes three years from announcement to operation, as observed in the earlier depots (Bulim, Loyang, Seletar, Ulu Pandan). It was through this observation that I am able to list down the year of which the remaining GCM depots would be announced, starting with the Sembawang-Yishun GCM depot this year.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Nonetheless, it's possible that the future Kim Chuan depot and the Changi 4-in-1 depot may have already been assigned to the "Serangoon-Eunos" package and "Bedok" package respectively.</p>

              <p>Well, according to the map,</p>
              <p>- The junction of Yishun Avenue 8 and 7 seems to be an ideal location to build the bus depot, for the "Sembawang-Yishun" package.</p>
              <p>- The junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 seems to be an ideal location to build the depot for the "Sengkang-Hougang" package.</p>
              <p>- The depot for "Bedok" package can be located at Bedok North Avenue 4 area, near the existing Bedok North depot.</p>
              <p>The depot for "Choa Chu Kang" package would probably be at Sungei Kadut area.</p>
              <p>and the list goes on.</p>
              <p>Basically, there are industrial areas around to site bus depots. It's unlikely that LTA will take over the depots owned by the operators, as that would mean paying for a property with shorter lease, and incurring the costs of refurbishing and upgrading the depot to have updated facilities.</p>
              <p>As for the assignment of routes, I do not think there would be any change to the composition of bus packages.</p>

                         <p>The new Bukit Panjang bus interchange would probably open in September, as now is already the last week of June holidays and there's still no news about the opening of Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange.</p>
              
              <p>Whereas for the new Tuas bus terminal, I have a feeling it may not be for the public bus services at the current Tuas bus terminal. Rather, it may be for the cross-border buses that are currently at Jurong East bus interchange and Boon Lay MRT station. As for the opening date, the earliest would be during the September or December school holidays. Probably December, since this would be quite a mass migration, with lots of paper work to be done.</p>

              be somehow impossible, there better be a bus bay for the bus
              stop.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint, but, the temporary Choa Chu Kang bus interchange may be about the same size as the current Choa Chu Kang bus interchange.</p>

              <p>Well, the new Jurong East bus interchange site is designated as 'White', which means the site can be "used for commercial, hotel, residential, sports &amp; recreational and other compatible uses, or a combination of two or more of such uses as a mixed-use development."</p>
              
              <p>In my opinion, the new Jurong East bus interchange may feature a bus interchange at ground level, and an office development above.</p>
              
                  <p>Recently, there was news about the Ministry of Transport wanting to set up their office at Jurong East MRT Station (<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/transport-ministry-lta-to-have-integrated-office-complex-at-jurong-east-mrt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Transport Ministry, LTA to have integrated office complex at Jurong East MRT station"</span></a>). The new bus interchange site could be the location.</p>

                                  <p>It is going to cost a lot to excavate the ground to build an underground facility that would only house a bus interchange.</p>
                      
                      <p>What they can do, however, is to build another bus interchange near the current HarbourFront bus interchange. They can take over the car park at the other side of Seah Im Road to build a bus interchange, for local bus routes to use (eg. 93, 188, 855, 963). The city-bound and Sentosa-bound bus routes should remain at the current HarbourFront bus interchange, for the convenience of the foreigners who visit Singapore (eg. 65, 80, 123, 124).</p>

              <p>Yes, the route would be very long, if we were to extend bus route 700 further to Boon Lay bus interchange. Already, the route length of bus 700 is 21 kilometres. The shortest route from Bukit Panjang bus interchange would be through Choa Chu Kang Road, Bukit Batok Road, Jurong Town Hall Road and Boon Lay Way, but this would extend the route by 9 kilometres, to 30 kilometres in one direction, which would be very long for a single direction bus service.</p>

                          <p>Agreed. Buses still play an important role even after 2030 when

                          <p>Yes, buses will always have an important role in providing transport connections from one place to another.</p>
              
              <p>Previously, the new Serangoon bus interchange had a smaller capacity, probably because the route planners thought the Circle Line would reduce the demand for buses and the number of bus routes required.</p>
              
              <p>However, when the new Serangoon bus interchange opened, no bus route was removed, although two routes (81 and 82) were made to loop outside the bus interchange. This may indicate a change in mindset, that there will always be demand for buses to provide the connections, which may otherwise not be provided or well-provided by the MRT. The only exception is the bus capacity. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the bus capacity would be reduced significantly, in the medium term of 10 to 15 years.
