              <p>Hi mr array88, it is actually easier to say. However you need to revisit the time frames where the interchanges are built in relative to why the current interchanges are built that way. Note the interchanges are built without the BSEP in consideration. BSEP is only launched in yr 2011, many years after the interchanges design plan are conceptualized. So at point of instance, those interchanges are planned to house a certain number of buses. If all failed to see this point, there is no use to launch scathing and all those é©¬å�Žç‚®remarks. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Bedok ITH also started construction in end 2011, yet in return we get a tiny ITH that has no hope for any future BSEP services.

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes I know serangoon interchange was built smaller. Take note it was built inside NEX and constraints must be thought of. I know Sbs 81 and Sbs 82 used to start from there and because of space, for sbs 82, the starting interchange was reversed and sbs 84 was introduced to cover a certain sector. Note, to you it is failed planning but to them, it was what is required. So it is actually a form of different expectations.</p>
              <p>For bedok ITH, don't even need to say. Planning already started years before 2011 and construction started in 2011. At that time, BSEP was just conceived of and is only in its infancy. New buses have not been bought in. </p>
              <p>For joo koon, it is enough for its current services and the area has Boon Lay and tuas to supplement. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>and there lies their stupidity. Just because I have a train station downstairs doesn't mean trains will allow me to get to where I want the most efficient way, compared to buses.

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, sometimes I realise people who never actually do the job love to pass many comments. They have numerous ideas and they always give many criticisms. As of now, i don't see super chaos at the interchanges yet. Famous interchanges are only up to about 95% capacity and they are still very well managed except for the occasional hiccups. You may be there a few times and you suddenly feel it more squeezy than the past. However it is still manageable. Not to the extent that it deserves a slap on the face. BSEP buses are carefully slotted into available interchanges months after months with proper training and code adherence. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Trains are efficient due to the less travelling time from places to places. (No Traffic Jams etc.) Govt. would focus on the bigger benefit rather than minor ones...which you see Aerospace industry is expanding fast and the Marine isn't. </p>
              <p>Some buses could win the train in terms of travelling time, but that's just minority few. You can't have the train to bring you every parts of S'pore. But with trains, you can shorten your travelling time by making transfer whereas possible and convenient. </p>
              <p>Idk why the train standard needs to be of HK MTR when Japan railway could be a competitor. But still, it's not as if you get breakdown so frequently out of your 10 rides on train in a month(let's say for students). </p>
              <p>But still, the bus industry needs to get better to adapt to the high demand of railway and population~ </p>

                  the occasional hiccups. You may be there a few times and you
                  suddenly feel it more squeezy than the past. However it is still
                  manageable. Not to the extent that it deserves a slap on the face.
                  BSEP buses are carefully slotted into available interchanges months
                  after months with proper training and code adherence. Cheers.

              <p>95% Capacity? According to you that is. Measured in terms of what? Number of buses at the interchangevs number of parking lots available or number of berths available? Have you seen Woodlands, Jurong East, Punggol Interchanges during peak hours?</p>
              <p>So you don't want criticisms to help give ideas to improve the transport system. You just want a compliant population, content with a can-be-improved system. Typical mindest of people who don't have the drive to constantly improve.</p>

              <p>Trains are efficient due to the less travelling time from places
              to places. (No Traffic Jams etc.) Govt. would focus on the bigger
              benefit rather than minor ones...which you see Aerospace industry
              is expanding fast and the Marine isn't. </p>
              <p>Some buses could win the train in terms of travelling time, but
              that's just minority few. You can't have the train to bring you
              every parts of S'pore. But with trains, you can shorten your
              travelling time by making transfer whereas possible and
              convenient. </p>
              <p>Idk why the train standard needs to be of HK MTR when Japan
              railway could be a competitor. But still, it's not as if you get
              breakdown so frequently out of your 10 rides on train in a
              month(let's say for students). </p>
              <p>But still, the bus industry needs to get better to adapt to the
              high demand of railway and population~ </p>

              <p>same for my bro who work at ubi. he said he will still take 8 instead take bus to dtl3 and then take mrt and then walk one bus stop. unless he say 8 freq become really silly. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I did not say that the rail network in Sg is
              sufficient to eliminate buses. By yr 2030, mrt will be almost
              everywhere within 400 metres of 80% of the population. There will
              always be buses and by then buses will still be used almost
              everywhere sparingly. However, some routes will be amended cans
              rationalized in view of the MRT. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I am also furious that they make the Thomson Marine parade line like this. So many stops in Marine parade area. But what can I do? However I believe many people staying in Marine parade are waiting for this mrt line and ditch the buses when time comes. For those who have alternatives, they will surely take the MRT. It is not that I want to offend people but this will be the truth one day. Sorry if I offend anybody staying in marine parade in this forum. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
