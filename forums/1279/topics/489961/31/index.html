              <p>BBDEP actually only has 9 spare DDs to play with, after
              accounting for missing buses.</p>
              <p>When HGDEP transferred some DDs to BBDEP to clear space, why did
              HGDEP not transfer any spare DDs to BBDEP? (Unless SBS7701R was the
              spare transferred over.)</p>
              <p>Strangely, BBDEP didn't use any B4 Wrights to replace SBS9469Z,
              SBS9471R, SBS9473K and SBS9494A. Instead, BBDEP used them to kick
              out CDGEs.</p>

              <p><strong>Sengkang Bus Interchange</strong></p>
                                  <p>The new air-conditioning system is now in use. Like finally. No more stuffy bus interchange.</p>
                                  <p>Meanwhile, the bus interchange looks brighter now. :)</p>
                              <p>As for the extension annex, until now I have not seen the shelter yet. Not sure if the construction can finish by Q3 or not.</p>
                              <p>Anyway, I guess the driveway into the extension annex may be that one at Compassvale Road, currently being used by the construction vehicles.</p>
                          
                          <p>Really hope that they plan the routes well, and not simply shorten Sengkang Bus Interchange routes at Compassvale Road to use the extension annex. I am okay with having bus services calling at the bus stop outside Compass Point (Sengkang MRT Station) to use the extension annex, but not for those that do not (e.g. 372) as passengers on those buses would have to walk longer distances to/fro the MRT Station as a result.</p>

              <p>Q: Why is Loyang Depot covered up like a prison?</p>
                          <p>There is this opaque green colour wall covering the entire perimeter of Loyang depot. I feel that this makes the depot look quite dark, and it is not good for the eyes.</p>
                      
                      <p>If we do not see long distances for a long period of time, it will affect our eyesight. For this reason, I pity the people working full-time inside the Loyang Bus Depot.</p> 
                      <p>Hopefully, go-ahead got organise some events for their staff, like once a week go outside walk walk or something. Everytime stay inside an enclosed space is not good.</p>
