I have one Uncle working at Changi Airport. Just saw him today during Chinese New Year reunion. Was shocked to see him in white hair and broken teeth. It's really sad to see him like that.

This is currently sorely lacking and I am wondering how did the authorities manage to let this slip through their eyes. The BTO flats at telok blangah heights opposite the hill are up already and there are more flats coming up. Cheers. Thanks:</p>

              <p>Hard to say! JE and Boon Lay r strategic locations for travellers as it is vry accessible (same logic as the SGKL HSR being placed in JE eventually, even thou the mrt can still provide connection in some way if its located in tuas). But then come to think of it, most CW services thru 2nd link has vry long dist like the CW4 i mentioned earlier. It would be helpful in either way as the drivers can rest at a nearer stop aft a heavy jam or smth, unlike the fact that they hav to drive to JE and Boon Lay. Proper parking lots shld oso hav. </p>
              <p>Essentially both places got its pros and cons</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS BUSES LOVER, I agree telok blangah drive has service
                      124 to harbourfront. What is needed is a direct service from telok
                      blangah drive/heights direct to tiong Bahru mrt. This is currently
                      sorely lacking and I am wondering how did the authorities manage to
                      let this slip through their eyes. The BTO flats st telok blangah
                      heights opposite the hill ads up already and there are more flats
                      coming up. Cheers. Thanks:</p>

              <p>I agree.. there's 120 to Redhill MRT but only a few pax stay until Redhill because of its windy route, most pax alight at Telok Blangah MRT. Should have routed 122 from NBR to Telok Blangah Drive/Heights via Tiong Bahru MRT and Henderson Road instead of doing C'wealth. 120 isn't affected much in this way as it mainly used for transfer to Telok Blangah MRT and its catchment is between Alexandra Road and Redhill MRT. A feeder or short trunk that passes by Redhill MRT from Bukit Merah interchange can cover Margaret Drive/C'wealth instead.</p>

              <p>121's route is fine, just that it has very poor loading between NBR and Ganges Ave. Perhaps, should have routed 121 to ply Chin Swee Rd instead of Zion/ Kim Seng Rd. At least Chin Swee will have connectivity to Tiong Bahru MRT and also it can complement 174 betwen Outram and Chin Swee. </p>
              <p>As for 120, I think if it were to routed the way you suggested, it will lose the popular Alexandra - Redhill connection. 120 is the only service from Alexendra Retail Centre and Redhill MRT and its loading is high along this stretch during peak hours. Also, it will lose its connection to Telok Blangah MRT which many Telok Blangah Dr/Heights residents rely on. Better to leave 120 untouched in my opinion.</p>
