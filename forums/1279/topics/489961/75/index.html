              <p>Over the years,LTA has been adding massive of buses to SMRT.For Kranji side,they used to overnight parking at Bukit Batok,CCK &amp; even BPJ.Ang Mo Kio side park at Yishun Int,Sembawang Int and Lor 1 Geylang while Woodlands with their Woodlands bus park until the BCM single depot ruling that they have to opt for parking at Bulim,Loyang and now Ulu Pandan.Woodlands Bus Park now is co-share among the 3 depots.Ang Mo Kio will surely move to Mandai in 2019,while Kranji probably will move to Gali batu maybe in 2020/2021?Woodlands Depot also i dont think will last long either given the low height areas(Water pipes area zone) that prevent more DDs to park.Maybe a new bigger depot in 5 years time.</p>

              <p>Hi. Your point made on having a bus park (personally i feel a proper ter would suffice) so that this could create a cleaner, less conjested, and safer bus stop at Kranji MRT and the people traffic could be better handled. Pertaining to the standby lots, idk what makes you say that theres a need for it. Just to point out, there is this thing called "Lane reject" at the JB checkpoint. So basically once the bus services drop their pax they would just U-turn and make their way back. Well unless that lane is closed recently, you can say otherwise. I will agree that the loading for JB Sentral is redundant, so its highly likely they U-turn at JB CIQ, unless u find out all trips go to JB Sentral Ter now (which is also a blummer, coz that ter always jam lah, even worse)</p>
