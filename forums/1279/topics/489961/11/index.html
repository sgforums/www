              <p>Hi. Is it true that the purpose of having this Woodlands
              temporary bus interchange is because the future thomson line
              station is planned below the station and the paid-link connection
              is somehow going to cut through the bus interchange?</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, is the other purpose to take this opportunity to
              replace the old equipment and make the bus interchange more
              comfortable?</p>

              area, as the existing bus interchanges are already full.</p>
              <p>but why still need to build tampines bus interchange number two,

              <p>unfortunately, changi business park bus terminal alone is not enough to support the increase in number of bus services in the eastern region. it is also not wise to have one large facility to contain every new bus service, otherwise there will be traffic congestion problems and unnecessary duplication of resources.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurong East
              Bus Interchange</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hi. Does anyone know when will the future Jurong East Bus
              Interchange be built? It has been four years since operations moved
              to the temporary facility. The new road (Gateway Drive) is already
              constructed and open. Soon, the economy will suffer a recession,
              where many people will become un-employed and things will become
              more expensive. Will this delay the development of the future
              Jurong East Bus Interchange?</p>
              <p>Also, I heard that the future Jurong East Bus Interchange may be
              developed together with the Jurong Region Line. Is it true?</p>
              <p>Anyway, when will it be ready? If I remember correctly, a
              newspaper article ever said that the temporary facility will be
              used for ten years, so I supposed in year 2022 the future Jurong
              East Bus Interchange will be ready. Construction should start
              latest by 2019... but why need so much time?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well, there is a likelihood that the Jurong Region Line will have a station interchange with the East-West-Line and North-South-Line at Jurong East. To some extent, the two developments have to accomodate one another. So, it is quite likely that the future Jurong East Bus Interchange will only be ready by 2025, at the same time as the Jurong Region Line.</p>
              <p>as to why it takes so long, it is because have to first clear the land where the original bus interchange was, then plan carefully on how to use the land. then after that have to build the new road, etcetera. all these takes time. and you are right, the economy also influence the progress. it's going to take some time. but it is worth the wait, because next time you get to wait for the bus at Jurong East Bus Interchange in air-conditioned comfort. :)</p>

                      <p>I do not know if anyone has realised this. The terms "interchange" and "terminal" are quite same-same, but different.</p>
                      <p><strong><span style="color: #993366;">same-same:</span></strong> both have bus interchange facilities, a bus bay, bus interchange canteen, etcetera.</p>
                      <p><strong><span style="color: #993366;">different:</span></strong> "terminal" not air-conditoned, and less boarding/alighting activities. "interchange" air-conditioned and more boarding/alighting activities.</p>
                      <p>Based on changi business park bus terminal and the upcoming tuas bus terminal, it seems that the term "terminal" only means a facility that has limited or less boarding/alighting activities (than a "interchange") and it is not air-conditioned.</p> <p>It seems that this is the new definition of "terminal", unlike in the past when a terminal means a container office, some parking lots and some portable toilets.</p>
                      <p>but of course, as now is still the transition phase for all bus interchanges to become air-conditioned, "terminal"s and the old/temporary "interchange"s tend to look alike.</p>

              <p>Hi mr tampinesresident, seriously what are you trying to do? Just don't create unnecessary trouble and this thread will continue by itself. When people want to type anything about bus interchanges, terminals and depots, they will type inside this thread and the messages will continue. There is no need for you to do anything to keep this thread going. </p>
              <p>When changi business park terminal starts tomorrow on 20/12, this thread will be focussed on the messages. No need for your unintended intervention. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>All, hooray. On SBS 3504U double decker sbs 117 from punggol to sembawang now. </p>
              <p>Riveria LRT bus stop: 5.59am wait sbs 3/83/85</p>
              <p>6.03am take sbs 83</p>
              <p>6.11am reach Punggol int</p>
              <p>6.17am sbs 117 arrives at berth B4</p>
              <p>6.47am reach khatib Mrt</p>
              <p>6.59am reach sembawang int. </p>
              <p>Just to get an estimated feeling of the time to reach destination. </p>
              <p>Of course not going to be super accurate because today is Sunday and it is the 3rd trip for a new launched service.</p>
              <p>Initial findings:</p>
              <p>48 min from Punggol east (Riveria LRT) to reach khatib mrt. This is slower than sbs 85 which takes 33 min plus 10 min waiting time.</p>
              <p>The longer time for sbs 117 is attributed to the winding around seletar aerospace and the super long yishun ave 1. This is as good as sbs 85 going 1 round in Sengkang east to west. So to all detractors who say sbs 117 is much faster, please think again. Take note there are only 2 passengers on sbs 117 today and the timing is already as such. </p>
              <p>Exactly 1 hr from Punggol east (Riveria LRT) to reach sembawang int. Sbs 117 takes 42 min from Punggol int to sembawang int. In future, with increase in load, may need add 10 to 15 min.</p>
              <p>Cheers. Thanks.</p>

                  <p>you want to discuss on one bus interchange, then all of a sudden some one else keep bombard the thread with other bus interchanges. in the end, there is never really a discussion about the bus interchange you want to discuss.</p>
                  <p>this will happen. in fact, it already has. just look at this page. people were discussing about Jurong East, Woodlands and Changi bus interchanges/terminal, and about interchange vs terminal. but the discussions were interrupted.</p>
                  <p>if we go on like this, soon, we will start to realise how come we keep discussing the same thing, and we get irritated with new users asking questions which have already been answered.</p>
                  <p>I mean, just look at the other forum. after all, isn't this thread a copy of the thread "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus Interchanges and ITHs</span>" at the other forum?</p>
               <p>Actually, how can we compare this forum with that other forum? We are (were) much more active in discussing buses than they are. They can make do with that because anyway there is not much discussion about buses. In this forum, with so much discussion about buses everyday, discussions will jam up if we have such a thread (ie. this thread).</p>
