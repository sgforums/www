              <p>btw: when you say "depending on remaining space", do you mean no. of berths, or no. of parking lots? coz IMO, 177 will loop, 180 will use the ITH, 971E will NEVER hav a berth as it works like 850E and 951E. 983 i think it will only loop outside? Just my views</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yr 2016 is going to end very soon with not even a piece of news saying about any hint of compassvale interchange opening. The only piece of news is from DPM Teo Chee hean facebook page when he goes to Sengkang area touring around and meeting residents. He mentions that the interchange extension is 'on the way'. These 3 words are just about it. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>171 loading is decent between Yishun and BPJ, v poor between BPJ and Botanic Gardens, picks up again between Stevens and Orchard because of high number of condos there.</p>
              <p>700 loading is not poor but definitely reduced. Highest loading point for 700 comes between Stevens and Orchard, just like 171. The loading between BPJ and Whitley is usually 40-50 pax (max) during peak hours unless bus is delayed. Given there is 190 and 972 both at 03-04 minutes frequency + 960 in parallel till Newton + peak hour service 971E, I wouldn't be surprised if 700 is modified. </p>
              <p>Though lately 700 did get another DD add. I would say keep 700 and def modify 171 and split 67. </p>

              <p>171 from Yishun to BPJ MRT station is 16km, and to Jln Anak Bukit (before Dunearn Rd) is 21km. Looping doubles that distance in a single trip.

              <p>700 can be withdrawn once the sections along Petir Rd and Stevens - Dunearn - Newton - Orchard are taken care of, so that can come in the form of amended 960 or 973 for the former, and amended 972 for the latter. (This is assuming that 171 is no longer there)</p>
              <p>In any case ... I find that the concentration of semi-express buses at Whitley Rd going west to BPJ (190, 700, 960, 972) is too high, while there's none that provide quick connection to Bt Batok, Jurong East, Clementi etc. AND there is DTL to BPJ but no fast MRT link to the listed locations either.

              <p>171 would mostly loop around BPJ as the link between BPJ and Upper Bukit Timah is still maintained by 75 and 184 and uptill Hillview with 963/970 in different parts of BPJ. Hence, 171 can continue to be loop. If 171 is extended to Beauty World, no option but have to be loop (can't even give 05 min rest time as can be done in BPJ if they want to). It is a good idea to extend to JE with merging with 41 but I highly doubt that will happen. Moreover the parallelism between 41 and 173 will be quite a bit and 41 will lose the transfer node at Bukit Timah Plaza to other services.</p>

              <p>They need to provide an alternative between Stevens - Dunearn - Orchard. This can be done as proposed by modified 972 but given that 972 already has a huge catchment between Orchard and BPJ ring, and modifying 972 will increase travel time, I doubt this may happen.</p>

              start from interchange. Even if it does, does not need dedicated
              parking space as buses will arrive and depart to CBD. </p>
              <p>983 should become BPJ &lt;&gt; CCK loop service as BPJ will have
              more space compared to CCK. CCK can then think of taking in
              700. </p>
              <p>I agree BPJ Interchange could have been bigger, but given the
              current situation seems okay to house current services. </p>

              <p>180 is 20km, comparable to 184 (21km).</p>
              <p>At least let it loop inside the bus interchange.</p>
              <p>There are people who take Downtown Line to Bukit Panjang, and then take 180 to Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>In any case, most pax'es boarding 39 at Tampines Interchange are using it for intra-town travel and will alight before Pasir Ris.  So now that 39 is no longer at the main interchange, this same group of people will just board 292.</p>
