              <p><strong>Sengkang Bus Interchange</strong></p>
                                              <p>There are sixteen parking bays, three alighting bays, four sawtooth boarding berths.</p>
                                              <p>Currently, the four sawtooth boarding berths can accomodate at least twelve bus services, yet the sixteen parking bays can only accomodate eight bus services.</p>
                      <p>The air-con replacement will be completed progressively by third quarter this year. I hope they can also take this opporunity to make the place brighter, by installing lamps with higher lux, painting the walls with white or some bright colours, etcetera.</p>

                                              <p><strong>Sengkang Bus Interchange expansion</strong></p>
                                              <p>Construction started around October last year. It will be constructed by the third quater of this year.</p>
                                              <p>Looking at the location, I feel that it is quite a walk from Sengkang MRT Station. Have to cross a bridge then can reach.</p>
                                              <p>As we all know, there will be twelve parking bays at the bus interchange expansion. With the expansion, there will be a total of twenty eight parking bays; there should be space for around fourteen bus services.</p>
                                              <p>I feel that we can actually fit around fourteen bus services at the four existing boarding berths. Two of the berths can have four bus services, while two berth can have three bus services. If like that, then the people do not have to walk long distances and climb the bridge to go over to the bus interchange expansion.</p>
                                              <p>The parking bays of the current interchange and expansion should be connected, with a common junction, so that buses can run between the two parking bays... but then, apparently, that is not the case. :(</p>
                                  <p>Having said that, it does not really matter. Not because I do not stay in Sengkang, but currently there are already bus services in Sengkang that only pass through Sengkang along Compassvale Road. For example, bus service 27. There are people who after alighting from MRT at Sengkang station have to walk long distances climb bridge and walk somemore to the bus stop at Compassvale Road just to take those bus services. So, it should not be a problem for more people to take the trouble to walk to the bus interchange extension.</p><p>Nonetheless, it would be good if bus routes originating from the bus interchange expansion can call at the bus stops outside Sengkang MRT Station, along Sengkang East Way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, there are eleven bus services. The current bus interchange parking bays can only accomodate eight bus services, so it's obviously undersized. With the expansion, hopefully there's enough parking bays for all the bus services.</p>
              <p>This also means Sengkang Bus Interchange can only have three more bus services after the expansion. With only three vacancies available, we should use them wisely.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, cannot be just 3 new routes. Current sengkang interchange still got space to fit in 1 new bus service. When news broke out initially last year, the expansion is to cater for 5 new bus services. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Levelling works would have to be done as the field is higher than the ground for the interchange. However, that shouldnt be too tough a job as Skg field was also higher than road level.  Just a random thought that flashed through my mind, what if they implemented end of berths?</p>

              <p><strong>Sengkang Bus Interchange</strong></p>
              <p>There are sixteen parking bays, three alighting bays, four
              sawtooth boarding berths.</p>
              <p>Currently, the four sawtooth boarding berths can accomodate at
              least twelve bus services, yet the sixteen parking bays can only
              accomodate eight bus services.</p>
              <p>The air-con replacement will be completed progressively by third
              quarter this year. I hope they can also take this opporunity to
              make the place brighter, by installing lamps with higher lux,
              painting the walls with white or some bright colours, etcetera.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sengkang Bus Interchange expansion</strong></p>
              <p>Construction started around October last year. It will be
              constructed by the third quater of this year.</p>
              <p>Looking at the location, I feel that it is quite a walk from
              Sengkang MRT Station. Have to cross a bridge then can reach.</p>
              <p>As we all know, there will be twelve parking bays at the bus
              interchange expansion. With the expansion, there will be a total of
              twenty eight parking bays; there should be space for around
              fourteen bus services.</p>
              <p>I feel that we can actually fit around fourteen bus services at
              the four existing boarding berths. Two of the berths can have four
              bus services, while two berth can have three bus services. If like
              that, then the people do not have to walk long distances and climb
              the bridge to go over to the bus interchange expansion.</p>
              <p>The parking bays of the current interchange and expansion should
              be connected, with a common junction, so that buses can run between
              the two parking bays... but then, apparently, that is not the case.
              :(</p>
              <p>Having said that, it does not really matter. Not because I do
              not stay in Sengkang, but currently there are already bus services
              in Sengkang that only pass through Sengkang along Compassvale Road.
              For example, bus service 27. There are people who after alighting
              from MRT at Sengkang station have to walk long distances climb
              bridge and walk somemore to the bus stop at Compassvale Road just
              to take those bus services. So, it should not be a problem for more
              people to take the trouble to walk to the bus interchange
              extension.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, it would be good if bus routes originating from the
              bus interchange expansion can call at the bus stops outside
              Sengkang MRT Station, along Sengkang East Way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Currently, there are eleven bus services. The current bus
              interchange parking bays can only accomodate eight bus services, so
              it's obviously undersized. With the expansion, hopefully there's
              enough parking bays for all the bus services.</p>
              <p>This also means Sengkang Bus Interchange can only have three
              more bus services after the expansion. With only three vacancies
              available, we should use them wisely.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>People need to be really dumb to alight at Sengkang MRT to take 27 after a long 10 min walk, when they can take 27 right outside Buangkok MRT. I highly suspect in our country where people disdain walking, they would do that. </p>
