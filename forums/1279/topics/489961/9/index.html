              <p>Hi mr 7337, I jogged down to interchange to see it myself. 382W will occupy berth B3. There is an additional plaque and a shorter queue in the middle of berth B3 and B4. That is for 382G. So there are total 4 plaques, not 3. One week ago, this plaque in the middle of berth B3 and B4 was not there. So 382G/W will not share the same plaque. The service numbers 382G/W are all printed on the ground. This shows any announcement will be coming very soon. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, sbs 84 is already fixed for Loyang depot package to be transferred to Go ahead group in Q3 2016. So not possible to extend to sengkang as sengkang interchange is not part of the 4 bus interchanges/terminals (namely pasir ris, Punggol, changi airport and changi village terminal). Cheers.

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, sbs 83 loading will improve from 20 dec onwards. It is expected to be boosted by LTA indirectly because they have made sbs 117/118 go a few stops in punggol way and central (west side) and terminate at punggol interchange. LTA must have done its sums and expect punggol central (east side) residents to take 3/83/85 to bus interchange and transfer to sbs 117/118. These 2 new services go directly out of punggol fast and are expected to be super hot cakes especially sbs 118. I think sbs 118 is expected to be full of punggol residents even before it reaches the TPE stop during morning peak hours (for residents of other town to transfer). Why? Direct service to CGH/expo/changi business park area! Who does not want? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, sbs 83 loading will improve from 20 dec
              onwards. It is expected to be boosted by LTA indirectly because
              they have made sbs 117/118 go a few stops in punggol way and
              central (west side) and terminate at punggol interchange. LTA must
              have done its sums and expect punggol central (east side) residents
              to take 3/83/85 to bus interchange and transfer to sbs 117/118.
              These 2 new services go directly out of punggol fast and are
              expected to be super hot cakes especially sbs 118. I think sbs 118
              is expected to be full of punggol residents even before it reaches
              the TPE stop during morning peak hours (for residents of other town
              to transfer). Why? Direct service to CGH/expo/changi business park
              area! Who does not want? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>83 loading within Punggol is not an issue even today. Unless there is 85 DD right in front, sv 83 can get good 50-60 pax to interchange in AM and back in PM. The loading that has dropped is between Punggol and Sengkang towns. This could be after TPE stop opened, people rather prefer to transfer at TPE stop for 27/89 etc than Punggol road. </p>
              <p>Hence, 83 loading has gone to 25-35 pax between these two towns.</p>
              <p>After Compass Point closing down, 83 leaves Sengkang interchange during AM peak with less than 10 pax and PM peak with 20-35 pax depending on bus arrival time. Most times &lt;30 pax.</p>
              <p>So even after 117/118, loading on 83 will continue to increase in punggol town but not b/w sengkang and punggol.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this I know. Compass point is temporarily closed for renovation. It will be up again in Q4 2016. Sbs 83 loading between sengkang mrt to punggol road bus stop will recover in time to come. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>117 might have only 1 bus resting at anytime in Punggol. Main rest station will be Sembawang.</p>
              <p>118 also will have only 1 bus resting at Punggol. Main rest station will be CBP Terminal.</p>
              <p>CBP Terminal right now has 12 lots... and only 2 services. So comfortably you will find 2-3 buses each on 118 and 47 parked at CBP.</p>
              <p>Will be nice if <strong>45 is extended to CBP Terminal</strong>. There is 14 to do UEC-Tanah Merah. This way 45 can provide nice direct connection to Expo/CBP for Bedok North residents and those along Hougang/Serangoon areas. </p>

              <p>I dunno about the suggestion of extending Svc 43 to CBP terminal will be a good idea eventhough I see your reasoning all is acceptable to have the service extended to CBP terminal.</p>
              <p>But if the service is extended to CBP, wont the journey be too long? Already the bus possibly takes about 20 mins time waiting (Long time nv take the bus).</p>

              <p>Not a huge concern. South ave 3 residents would have appreciated sv 43 as it has DDs. They would have liked the direct connection to ITE, Expo &amp; CBP. Current load of 48 is just to Tanah Merah MRT. And few who board at Tanah Merah towards industrial estate, but have 2/9 as well. </p>
