              <p>Firstly, i only have 2 buses at my doorstep if 911 is late or
              crowded i got 858. Removing it will be a disadvantage plus areas
              like Gambas Ave and 3M at Ave 7 needs 858. It will cause alot of

              <p>what I am suggesting is splitting Route 858. WDL-SBW portion can be easily covered by a new route. Much had been said about the sticky situation of Route 858 in the A24 thread.</p>

              <p>After some thought, I shall refine my suggestion a little -
              putting it down to three semi-independent schemes that may still
              increase the efficiency overall.</p>
              <p>The map is here: <a title="Yishun route adjustments" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zEEpmI3uw7s8.k1cLkPzdzugo&amp;amp;usp=sharing">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zEEpmI3uw7s8.k1cLkPzdzugo&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>
              <p>Here goes:</p>
              <p>===================================</p>
              <p><strong>Scheme A:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>857</strong></span> (or some other
              suitable Yishun trunk)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl 1</li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ctrl 2</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ctrl</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ave 4</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ring Rd</span></li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to Suntec City)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This amendment makes good use of the DDs added to the 857 fleet
              to cover the <span style="color: #3366ff;">link between Yishun Ave
              4</span> (incl. the schools along the way) <span style="color: #3366ff;">and Khatib MRT</span>.</p>
              <p>The extended stretch from Ctrl 2 to Khatib MRT is about 2,240m,
              an <span style="color: #3366ff;">increase</span> from the current
              undiverted 978m <span style="color: #3366ff;">by about
              1,262m</span> or 1.26km. Two pairs of bus stops are skipped (with
              alternative service 855) in favour of six pairs of new stops.</p>
              <p>Using 857 is tentative, of course, but it would be best to
              employ one with decent frequency (to match 812) as well as having a
              HC (bendy / DD) fleet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scheme B:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>85</strong></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ctrl 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ctrl 2</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun St 61</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ring Rd</span></li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to Punggol)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This amendment makes good use of the DDs added to 85 fleet to
              cover the <span style="color: #ff00ff;">link between Yishun St 61
              and Khatib MRT.</span> The extended route is about 1.7km, an
              <span style="color: #ff00ff;">increase of about 1km</span> from the
              current 700m undiverted route. It disregards the territorial
              concerns between SMRT and SBST, and maintains the link to
              Northpoint, while skipping only one pair of bus stops in favour of
              six pairs of new stops.</p>
              <p>As a result of this change, <strong>858 will skip Yishun Ctrl 1
              &amp; 2</strong> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reduce problems for its
              bendys</span>. Without 85, an alternative (and somewhat faster)
              link to Jln Kayu and Punggol is provided by 117.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, this route amendment may be carried out on 117,
              in the event that it could cause traffic disruptions or demand
              problems on 85.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scheme C:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>812</strong></span> (East loop)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li>Yishun St 61</li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun Ring Rd<br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun St 41</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun St 51</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Yishun Ave
              4</em><br></span></li>
              <li>Yishun St 61</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to west loop)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a consequence of scheme A, or both A and B, 812's east loop
              will be less stressful / in demand. The change will allow the
              service to <span style="color: #008000;">skip the northern section
              of Ave 4</span> (<span style="color: #3366ff;">served by
              857</span>), and <span style="color: #008000;">serve the newly
              developed areas at St 51 / 52.</span> The bus stop at Blk 322 is
              still within walking distance to the bus interchange (for 857), to
              maintain the link to Ave 4.</p>
              <p>Making use of 812 also eliminates the need to introduce a brand
              new feeder service to St 51 / 52 / 41, thus saving a berth at
              Yishun Temporary Interchange.</p>
              <p>The extended route is very tentative and subject to changes.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000;">It may not necessitate implementation until the
              new estates are ready.</span></span></p>
              <p>===================================</p>
              <p>So, please do comment. In lieu of the situation in Yishun town,
              I am very eager to suggest this to LTA already.</p>

                      <p>The sawtooth section has 15 parking lots. The end-on section has 18 parking lots. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Officially, the bus interchange has 33 parking lots.</span></p>
                      <p>but I think the capacity can be as high as around forty one, as there are buses parked at the sides of the driveway. I guess there is space at the sides of the driveway for around eight buses.</p>
                      <p>There will be some renovation works at Bukit Batok Bus Interchange, by the LTA. The renovation works will be completed at around June 2016. I guess more parking lots will be drawn (probably only at the side parallel to the road; around five) and the official number of parking lots will increase.</p>

              <p>Is it dependent on run-time?</p>
              <p>For instance, sv 14 run time in one direction is 140 mins... so does sv 14 get 20 mins layover time at Clementi/Bedok</p>
              <p>Contrary sv 38 run time is 100 mins... so does sv 38 get 15 mins layover time at Tampines</p>
              <p>Not sure how the layover/rest time is calculated, but I feel for most services this is around 20 minutes at an interchange/terminal. It could be 15 mins for feeders? or could it be even more than 20 minutes for certain services?</p>
              <p>Confused and looking for answers.</p>

              <p>Hmm.. I think it will take time for the commuters to get use of transfering from BP LRT to BP MRT via the walkway. Since you mention that 700 &amp; 972 already at Bukit Panjang, I think Svc 190 and Svc 972 can switch whereby Svc 190 loops at Bencoolen St while Svc 972 terminate at New Bridge Road.</p>
              <p>Loading for Svc 67 still need to take a look whether commuters prefer Svc 67 - BP MRT ot BP LRT (Walkway) - BP MRT</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS9256X, what a suggestion. By a mere stroke of your sentences, you have suddenly deprived a huge portion of CCK residents 2 trunk services by just cutting smrt 67 route and smrt 190 route. CCK residents will be up in arms. This will definitely not be allowed. For those people who keep cutting routes, think of the huge impact that it will be. CCK to orchard smrt 190 connection gone. Who will still want to live in CCK when transport connections are considered bad as compared to other towns and now people keep suggesting to cut further? Cheers. Thanks.</p>
