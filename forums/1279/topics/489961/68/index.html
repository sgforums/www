              <p>It was reported as such.. Anyways what's wrong with going that big round? In that case esplain the routing of DTL with its round in the middle. So long as it allows for catchment along the way a detour isnt a problem. This would allow the line to directly connect both the entire TEL to T1/2/3 and Expo, and EWL commuters to T5. </p>

              lot of ppl are also "screaming and cursing" why the SG govt is
              still doing nth abt direct airport – city train service when other
              countries/cities have done so (Eg. Malaysia KLIA, Taiwan Taoyuan
              etc.) IMO it is not really feasible for an express straight to the
              city, but if no transfer to city then maybe can, smth like
              staggering 2 pasir ris bound trains with 1 CGA train or smth.</p>

              <p>Yea so this is exactly where TEL will shine since it has direct svc to city area AND all trains can terminate there.. Direct svc is difficult for EWL since got spur line to PSR and diverting trains to CGA will only reduce freq for PSR end.. This is prob why the CGA direct trains were never resumed after they were suspended</p>

              <p>Actually, the Boon Lay - Changi Airport direct train service had been resumed when more than half of the C751B fleet had been repaired and put back onto service on 16 May 2002. It was only in July 2003 when SMRT convert it back to the shuttle service from Tanah Merah to Changi Airport, aside from the reason which you mentioned; it is also meant for ease of passengers who wanted to travel towards Changi Airport from the 3 eastbound stations before Tanah Merah. However, it seems that once DTL3 opens later this year, the passenger flow might be different.</p>

              <p>As I mentioned, the effective consequence of the branch line being replaced was that the station structures along the branch line will have to be demolished as a result of non-usage. It is not a practical or desirable outcome in my view.</p>

              <p>What has depreciation got to do with this? It's not as if tracks or other assets such as tracks, trains and systems are going to be sold. They will need to be replaced (like trains and signalling system). Train tracks, viaducts and associated infrastructure are meant to last at least 50 years and replacing it with a new line would prove very costly, especially with the new platform at Tanah Merah becoming a white elephant.</p>
