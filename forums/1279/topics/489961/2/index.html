              <p>Thanks. Hmm... then we may end up with another 38-like scenario, looping around instead of going in straight line... eventually might there be feeders/loops coming out of the Changi Business Park terminal? Lol</p>
              <p>Meanwhile also the Townlink branding is disappearing with the use of EDS.</p>

              <p>Probably 20 amended to skip some parts of the looping portion, e.g. after Changi Sth Ave 4, go straight to Changi Biz Pk Vista, then turn right into Changi Sth Ave 1 to terminate. Then the skipped section at CBP Ctrl 2, Ave 3 replaced by another service. Either that or vice versa.Â </p>
              <p>I'd guess that other than 20 to Tampines, other svcs at CBP bus terminal might go to Bedok/UEC, Pasir Ris and Sengkang/Punggol. Although I'm not sure if we really need so many full day bus svcs to CBP, especially on weekends.</p>

              <p>Okay, firstly I would like to apologise about the previous info. According to the person who provided the photos, there are only 11 berths, because one "berth" at the end seems too narrow for buses.</p>
              <p>Regarding svc 20, honestly I would like to see it the way it is today. The Changi South Ave 2/4 sector is equally important as CBP and may even have higher loading. If 20 has to be amended to CBP Ter, a new service should be introduced to replace the deleted sector and connect to EWL at least.</p>

              <p>If sv 20 is amended to start from CBP, it will have to ply in both directions on Changi South Ave 2/4 and that is possible without missing any link.</p>
              <p>I think it would also make sense to launch new service that goes to Tanah Merah MRT, so that people don't have to transfer at Expo to go to Tanah Merah.</p>
              <p>Apart from this, I think will be great if sv 39 is diverted to CBP. The only stops it will miss is Tampines Ave 5 / Tampines Interchange but will not be loss to people as those bound for Pasir Ris will have sv 81, those for Yishun will still have sv 969 from interchange.
