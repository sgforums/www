              <p>Hahas.. Not all lorhx... I was thinking of Bishan Interchange can use the open field to have an integrated hub.</p>
              <p>*Future intergrated hub: Bishan, Yio Chu Kang, Marina South</p>
              <p>I also think that Queen Street Bus Terminal can be shifted to the empty field along Ophir Rd/Beach Road there... So that people have access to Bugis MRT and easy also for ppl to go to Arab Street and nearby shopping facilities.</p>

              <p>LTA should start consider having more small road side bus terminals. More bus terminals would result in shorter and more time reliable bus trips. And with more mrt stations and more comfortable train rides, more people will now be willing to make bus-train transfers.

              <p>LTA can consider having a bus terminal in Napier. And having shorter and more frequent and reliable bus trips between Napier and the nearby estates. The Thomson line can bring the commuters into Orchard and City.</p>

              <p>Napier is such a valuable location. Why waste it on a bus interchange? -no offences-</p>
              <p>I think a better location is Nicoll Highway area, along Republic Avenue. As mentioned in the other thread, we can re-align Republic Avenue (junction of Ophir Road and Republic Boulevard) to create a plot of land big enough to build a major bus interchange of the size of Larkin Bus Terminal.</p>
              <p>Larkin Bus Terminal can have so many parking lots is partly because most of it is not connected to the concourse... I do not know how to explain... anyway, we can easily build a Singapore-style bus interchange with around thirty five parking lots at Nicoll Highway area, featuring an alighting bay and around six sawtooth boarding berths. after all, Nicoll Highway area is somewhat a wasteland. so might as well use it for bus interchange.</p>

              <p>Siglap terminal can be built even today. There is space. It can be a roadside terminal with say 9 designated slots, 3 each for every service. All they need to do is make it official and designate parking lots so that buses dont anyhow park.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">For nearby estates, I am referring to Queenstown/Tanglin Halt/Commonwealth, Holland, Farrer and even MeiLing. The nearest, quickest and easiest access to a Thomson-East Coast Line train station would be Napier. Travelling time to Napier via Holland Road for above residents may be under 10 minutes.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Thomson-East Coast Line is another major transport backbone after EWL, NSL. Thomson, together with DownTown line will have covered many areas in Singapore. Our transport budget is not insatiable, there is a limit, we cannot forever initiate new and maintaining existing bus services. The completion of Thomson line may enable the authority to kick start a bus/train model.  </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I suggest Napier for it offers a termination for existing bus services running along Holland Road. Seriously with Thomson-East Coast Line, many bus services can be withdrawn and shortened. A Napier terminal will give the authority an additional option to early terminate some of the services there. Continuing existing bus services there then will result in serious resources redundancy.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">What may prompt a commuter to switch to a bus/train model:</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">a. Easy bus/train train transfer at stations.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">b. Easy and quick access to bus services to these train stations. If above residents can reach Napier in 12-15 minutes [including bus waiting time], Thomson Lines would be beneficial to these people too.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">c. Comfortable train rides. I am awed by an almost empty EW train cabin on a weekday evening peak at Bugis. And now EW is a considerable and available option for me to travel to Commonwealth and beyond. In the past, I had totally ruled out EW line if in Bugis.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d. More than 2 Train-Train transfers may be deterrent. Example travelling from Tanglin Halt to Sixth Avenue [2 train-train transfer at BV and BG], from Dawson to AMK [2 train-train transfer at BV and BS]</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d. Authorities have to be high-handed in removing, shortening existing bus services. Initiating shortest, fastest and highest frequency bus services to key nodes in estates. For above residents, key nodes for them could be Buona Vista [for EW -CCL], Botanic Gardens [for CCL-DTL] and Napier [for TECL]. Road side bus terminals at Napier and BG can provide loop bus services from these key nodes to above-mentioned areas.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d1: Example buses running express along Holland Road and Queensway, just to serve residents in MeiLing and Dawson.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d2: Another bus loop services to running express along Holland and Queenway, just to serve residents in Tanglin Halt and Alexandra.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d3. Another bus loop services running express just to service residents in Dover and GM.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">d4. Another bus loop services running express serving Holland and Commonwealth.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">e. With more MRT lines comming, a total revamp in bus services is indeed necessary.  </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Though I hate to see existing bus services terminating at Napier, however if in returns, we are having rapid bus services that bring us to key transport nodes in our neighbourhood, it's a blessing in disguise.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">There used to have a Holland Fringe carpark [Peirce Road] whereby Service 777(?) terminated at [From Changi Airport]. With Napier terminal, looping bus services to nearby estates can be initiated Peirce Road. The buses shall end at Glenegles or the Napier train station. Perhaps now [while building the Napier station] its time for the authority to design a return route for buses from Glenegles back to Peirce Road. </p>

              <p>That's a good idea and one I feel is necessary, but do take note that the parcel of land in between the said location and Victoria School is to be developed likely as a condominium.  This may be what is interfering with any plans to build terminals there.  Anyway, that stretch is usually congested with private coaches laying over around 2pm, to the extent that some illegally park on double yellow lines.</p>

              <p>It's a matter of efficiency and resource management, really ... it 
                                      still bugs me as to why some of the less crowded Yishun trunk services 
                                      (especially 852, 853) are not being diverted to serve the inner roads 
                                      (as is the case for many SBS towns, in particular Tampines), while at 
                                      the same time so much resources is dumped onto new feeders and 
                                      intra-towns (804, 860).</p>
              <p>For example, it would only require a short diversion for any 
                                      trunk service serving at Khatib MRT to pass by Yishun St 61 / Ave 4, or 
                                      Yishun Ring Rd near St 71 / 72. The trunk would link these areas to both
                                       Khatib and Yishun MRT stations, while skipping a few stops that the 
                                      remaining trunks can easily cover. 812 would also be freed to serve the 
                                      new St 41 / 51 areas.</p>
              <p>===========================</p>
              <p>What about 853 and 855? Seeing that both have moderate frequency
                                                              / demand and do not serve Yishun Ave 2 outside Yishun MRT, is it
                                                              possible that they can be enhanced to take over 812's route at both
                                                              St 61 and Ave 4, with minimal route amendments? As per below:</p>
              <p><strong>853</strong>: Yishun Int --&gt; Ctrl 2 <span style="color: #33cccc;">--&gt; Ctrl --&gt; Ave 4 --&gt; Ring Rd</span> --&gt; Ave 2</p>
              <p><strong>855</strong>: Yishun Int <span style="color: #ff9900;">--&gt; Ctrl (via SAFRA &amp; KTP) --&gt; St 61
                                                              --&gt; Ring Rd</span> --&gt; Ave 2</p>
              <p>In this way we have two-way direct services to KTP and SAFRA
                                                              from Khatib MRT. Chung Cheng and Northland get proper links as
                                                              well. The stop at Blk 935 still has 857, and is close enough to
                                                              Yishun Ave 2 for other services.</p>
              <p>Then:</p>
              <p><strong>812</strong> (merged, with G/W): Yishun Int --&gt; Ave 2

              <p>After some thought, I shall refine my suggestion a little - putting it down to three semi-independent schemes that may still increase the efficiency overall.</p>
              <p>The map is here: <a title="Yishun route adjustments" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zEEpmI3uw7s8.k1cLkPzdzugo&amp;usp=sharing">https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zEEpmI3uw7s8.k1cLkPzdzugo&amp;usp=sharing</a></p>
              <p>Here goes:</p>
              <p>===================================</p>
              <p><strong>Scheme A:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>857</strong></span> (or some other suitable Yishun trunk)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl 1</li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ctrl 2</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ctrl</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ave 4</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #3366ff;">Yishun Ring Rd</span></li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to Suntec City)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This amendment makes good use of the DDs added to the 857 fleet to cover the <span style="color: #3366ff;">link between Yishun Ave 4</span> (incl. the schools along the way) <span style="color: #3366ff;">and Khatib MRT</span>.</p>
              <p>The extended stretch from Ctrl 2 to Khatib MRT is about 2,240m, an <span style="color: #3366ff;">increase</span> from the current undiverted 978m <span style="color: #3366ff;">by about 1,262m</span> or 1.26km. Two pairs of bus stops are skipped (with alternative service 855) in favour of six pairs of new stops.</p>
              <p>Using 857 is tentative, of course, but it would be best to employ one with decent frequency (to match 812) as well as having a HC (bendy / DD) fleet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scheme B:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>85</strong></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ctrl 1</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ctrl 2</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun St 61</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Yishun Ring Rd</span></li>
              <li>Yishun Ave 2</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to Punggol)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This amendment makes good use of the DDs added to 85 fleet to cover the <span style="color: #ff00ff;">link between Yishun St 61 and Khatib MRT.</span> The extended route is about 1.7km, an <span style="color: #ff00ff;">increase of about 1km</span> from the current 700m undiverted route. It disregards the territorial concerns between SMRT and SBST, and maintains the link to Northpoint, while skipping only one pair of bus stops in favour of six pairs of new stops.</p>
              <p>As a result of this change, <strong>858 will skip Yishun Ctrl 1 &amp; 2</strong> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reduce problems for its bendys</span>. Without 85, an alternative (and somewhat faster) link to Jln Kayu and Punggol is provided by 117.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, this route amendment may be carried out on 117, in the event that it could cause traffic disruptions or demand problems on 85.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scheme C:</strong> Amendment of <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>812</strong></span> (East loop)</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Yishun Int</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li>Yishun St 61</li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun Ring Rd<br></span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun St 41</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;">Yishun St 51</span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Yishun Ave 4</em><br></span></li>
              <li>Yishun St 61</li>
              <li>Yishun Ctrl</li>
              <li><em>(usual route to west loop)</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a consequence of scheme A, or both A and B, 812's east loop will be less stressful / in demand. The change will allow the service to <span style="color: #008000;">skip the northern section of Ave 4</span> (<span style="color: #3366ff;">served by 857</span>), and <span style="color: #008000;">serve the newly developed areas at St 51 / 52.</span> The bus stop at Blk 322 is still within walking distance to the bus interchange (for 857), to maintain the link to Ave 4.</p>
              <p>Making use of 812 also eliminates the need to introduce a brand new feeder service to St 51 / 52 / 41, thus saving a berth at Yishun Temporary Interchange.</p>
              <p>The extended route is very tentative and subject to changes. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000;">It may not necessitate implementation until the new estates are ready.</span></span></p>
              <p>===================================</p>
              <p>So, please do comment. In lieu of the situation in Yishun town, I am very eager to suggest this to LTA already.</p>

              <p>We can open one new cross-boarder bus service to Larkin - if

              <p>Hi mr iveco, before anybody just passes any casual remarks about shortening services, let's consider the impacts first. First shortening smrt 858 from woodlands to Sembawang is a NO-NO. Impact for woodlands side will be great. Current passenger load from woodlands is affected. Many inconveniences will be brought upon as there is no service to make up for the loss of direct linkage. Woodlands ave 4 Blk 864 bus stop lost its only service SMRT 858 some more. Such a cut will only bring upon more disadvantages. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, smrt 858 will not be shortened. The forumers are just trying to suggest their opinions. Rest assured they are merely suggestions. Even if people wrote in to LTA. I doubt they will listen. Only those who live along the routes of the services suggested will truly understand the impact. Others who keep on suggesting alternatives and trimming for SMRT 858 will never understand. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Though I believe letting 85 or 117 take over 858's diversion at Yishun Polyclinic would be a decent move. (Refer to my suggestion above)</p>
