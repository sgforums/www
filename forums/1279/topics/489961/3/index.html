              <p>Hi Mr BusAnalyzer, thanks for the insider's information.</p>
              <p>From my observations, it seems that the heavily utilized Jurong-Industrial bus services are 182, 251 and 252. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I think it is more logical to move 182, 254, 255 and 257, because these are bus services for the Tuas Industrial Area, not Jurong. Besides, these routes duplicate other routes when in Jurong area, except at Benoi Sector area.</p>
              <p>I suppose there would be new bus services for Benoi area, while 254, 255 and 257 are shortened to Joo Koon Bus Interchange.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr AJQZC, I have scanned through the links. Actually, I wrote something similar on the forums back in February/March this year.</p>
              <p>Well, the consensus is clear. It's 254, 255, 257. And 182. That would go to Joo Koon. The new bus routes are roughly the same across all our suggestions, all at Benoi area.</p>
              <p>The new part is 99. I do not think anyone saw it coming, until someone leaked the information that 99 would go to Joo Koon. Well, I welcome the idea of letting 99 terminate at Joo Koon. Currently, a journey from Clementi to Jurong West Street 91 takes around two to three hours, not to mention returning back to Clementi. By extending the route to Joo Koon, we are actually shortening the trip by around half. This would make it less exhausting for the bus captains to drive 99.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, bus 972 is another long route that is just like 99 - except the kind of catchment area it serves. Would it be feasible to extend it to a bus terminal (eg. Marina Centre Bus Terminal) and terminate there?</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, bus 972 is another long route that is just like 99 -
                  except the kind of catchment area it serves. Would it be feasible
                  to extend it to a bus terminal (eg. Marina Centre Bus Terminal) and
                  terminate there?</p>

              <p>99 and 972 is not the same case. 972 is pretty fast as it has a sole purpose of connecting Orchard with BPJ. 99 is long winding and is more of an intra-town service. Hence, 99 coming to a logical terminating point whether Boon Lay or Joo Koon is welcome. 972 looping @ Dhoby Ghaut is doing well for itself.</p>

              <p>972 fast meh? That time I took 972 from the bus stop outside Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and alighted at one of the first few bus stops at Bukit Panjang town. It was during peak hours. The entire route between Dhoby Ghaut and just before the bus enter Bukit Panjang was congested. If I remember correctly, that journey took around one hour thirty minutes.</p>
              <p>Okay la. Since Mr BusAnalyzer says so, then One hour thirty minutes to complete around ten kilometers is still quite fast. :)</p>
              <p>To make the already quite-fast journey even faster, I have a suggestion:</p>
              <p>Bus Lanes.</p>
              <p>I know, from my experience at the other forum (Skyscrapercity Singapore - Transport/Infrastructure) when I suggested bus lanes, there may be people here (SGforums) who would say that Singapore land is scarce. But you look at Hong Kong. Although Singapore size is smaller than Hong Kong size, Singapore has more use-able land. If Hong Kong can build tram tracks on the roads, I am sure Singapore can have more full-day bus lanes on the roads.</p>

              <p>To make the already quite-fast journey even faster, I have a
              suggestion:</p>
              <p>Bus Lanes.</p>
              <p>I know, from my experience at the other forum (Skyscrapercity
              Singapore - Transport/Infrastructure) when I suggested bus lanes,
              there may be people here (SGforums) who would say that Singapore
              land is scarce. But you look at Hong Kong. Although Singapore size
              is smaller than Hong Kong size, Singapore has more use-able land.
              If Hong Kong can build tram tracks on the roads, I am sure
              Singapore can have more full-day bus lanes on the roads.</p>
