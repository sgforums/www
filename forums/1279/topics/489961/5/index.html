              published by The Straits Times on 29 August 2015,</p>
              <p>"" The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be working in the
              area from the first quarter of next year to relocate the existing
              Shenton Way Bus Terminal along Keppel Road to a plot of land near
              the Bestway Building.</p>
              <p>The new bus terminal will be ready in 2017, and have additional
              facilities such as a canteen and passenger service centre.</p>
              <p>An LTA spokesman said a single- storey structure within the
              Bestway compound will be demolished "to facilitate the relocation".
              But the building will not be affected by the relocation of the bus
              terminal. ""</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>7. To cater to future needs, Kim Chuan Depot will be expanded to
              almost double its capacity from 70 to 133 trains. The integrated
              depot will also house 550 buses, which will allow us to optimise
              land use.  The expansion of the depot will be completed at
              about the same time as CCL6 in 2025.</p>
              <p>There will be a bus depot located in the vicinity of Kim Chuan

              <p>If they want to restore this building, then I would suggest that the building could be a recruitment and simulation centre for SBS Transit/SMRT/TT (Future) drivers. At the same time, maybe level 1 of the building can have a proper lounge room, facility room, recreation room for drivers.</p>

              <p><strong>New Bus Terminal at Changi Business Park.</strong></p>
                      <p><strong>(at the junction of Changi South Avenue 1 and Changi Business Park Central 2)</strong></p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Apparently, the new bus terminal has twelve bus parking lots, which means it can accommodate around four to six bus services.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, there is a bus terminal at Changi Village Road that has four bus services. There seems to be around sixteen bus parking lots.</p>
                      <p>Well, I was wondering if the new bus terminal would replace the bus terminal at Changi Village Road. However, I feel that there would be more cons than pros. So, no.</p>
                      <p> </p>
                      <p>I guess other bus services will be re-routed to terminate at the new bus terminal.</p>
                      <p>Bus Service 20 is very likely.</p>
                      <p>Other than that, I do not think there would be any existing bus services being re-routed to terminate at the new bus terminal.</p>
                      <p>The new bus terminal is likely to have only new bus services.</p>
                      <p>Anyway, Changi Business Park seems to be under-served today.</p>
                      <p>I guess there will be around three to five new bus services at the new bus terminal, serving the people working at Changi Business Park, to connect them to various MRT stations and Bus Interchanges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bedok and Pasir Ris towns are likely, so that's two bus services. One more can give to Bedok North area. So that's three.</p>
              <p>If can accommodate up to five bus services, we can have one to Changi Village, and another to the North-East.</p>

              <p>How would Changi Business Park Terminal replace Changi Village Terminal?? Where do you propose sv 2, 59, 109 to terminate in this case?</p>
              <p>And which are the 4 services terminating at Changi Village - it is only 3 with sv 29 looping there. </p>

              <p>CGV used to have a lot of services until all but Svc 2 got withdrawn, the other 3 are not original</p>
              <p>Bedok is the most practical, but risk duplicating either Svc 14 (via Bedok Nth) or Svc 35 (most direct). Also, 35M is used currently</p>
              <p>Pasir Ris have Svc 5, but takes a big loop via Changi Nth. Most direct link will probably be via Dr 1 and Loyang, but will duplicate almost half of the services in Pasir Ris. Best suggestion seen here involved rerouting Svc 39 to CBP, but requires it to detour via Tampines.</p>
              <p>Best route for a North-East to CBP is currently an M varient of Svc 34, serving CBP instead of CGA, but will probably end up being spammed with SDs</p>

              <p>Yes... waiting for CBP to open... and then we will see new service</p>

              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>- Connects Punggol West Town (43 part) / Punggol Field (119 part) to Punggol road/TPE stops (with new developments opened this year and next year need this)</p>

              <p>- Loading expected to be very high in peak direction</p>
              <p>- Relieve some loading on sv 34</p>
