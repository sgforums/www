                  <p>If the original has <strong>seventeen</strong>, the new one probably has seventeen also, assuming it's a one-for-one replacement.</p>
                  <p>If the new Tuas Bus Terminal has seventeen parking lots, this means it can accommodate at least six bus services.</p>

                  <p>3 parking lots is for bus services more than 16km, 2 parking lots is for bus services less than 16km. I am not sure how the parking lots are allocated, but I guess 16km is the cut-off between 2 parking lots and 3 parking lots.</p>
                  <p>This is on the assumption that bus services 192 and 193 remain at Tuas Bus Terminal.</p>

              <p>I have a feeling Joo Koon might get another new JIS service to complement 182 at Tuas south. It might run express via 254 route till it reaches Tuas south. Once Tuas MRT extension is complete, this service will move to Tuas. </p>
              <p>Tuas in future could have 2 new services for Tuas south + 192/193 that can have more slots dedicated at Tuas than Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>182 will stay as it is for Pasir Laba and so will 254.. unless 254 becomes a Tuas - Joo Koon (loop) service. </p>
              <p>So I don't expect more than 4 or 5 services at Tuas terminal.</p>

                  <p>First of all, we have to wait and see if the new Tuas Bus Terminal has the same number of parking lots as the original Tuas Bus Terminal (17). What if the new facility has less? (What if it has more?)</p>
                  <p>Tuas Bus Terminal used to have bus service 183 (Tuas Bus Terminal - Tuas South Avenue (loop)) and bus service 262  (Tuas Bus Terminal - Larkin). Bus Service 182 used to terminate here. I do not know if there are other bus services which used to terminate at Tuas Bus Terminal.</p>
                  <p>By the way, I have a question.</p>
                  <p>Q: Is the heavy vehicle park near Raffles Golf Course the original site of Tuas Bus Terminal, before it was closed and re-opened a few years later at the present  (until 2015) location?</p>

              <p>I believe Changi Business Pk Ter was opened in a rush. Hence, no proper queueing system, no add-value machine, no clear division of berths (look at St Michael's Ter and you'll know what I mean), no electronic signboards to indicate bus departure timings, etc.</p>
              <p>Although now it seems like a rather quiet and ulu place, I think the human traffic there will gradually increase... Yesterday I saw some plane spotters and some people playing sports in the open fields nearby. These people may start to use the bus terminal soon. We can also expect some SUTD students to walk to Changi Business Pk Ter maybe?</p>

              <p>I feel that there is no need for bus interchange facilities in Changi Business Park Bus Terminal. There is also no need to enable boarding/alighting activity at this bus terminal. The location is at one end of Changi Business Park. Clearly, the bus terminal is to let bus services - which connect Changi Business Park to a MRT station or some residential areas - to have a place to terminate. Otherwise, the bus services would be too long if they were to loop around Changi Business Park and return to their origins. It is just for the bus and the driver to take a break, after driving around 20km for around 1 hr plus.</p>
                                                      <p>The only setback is that bus service 47 only calls at Changi Business Park Bus Terminal and there is no canteen in the terminal or any food stall in the vicinity - unlike bus service 118 that also calls at Punggol Bus Interchange where there is a canteen and some food stalls. Actually, bus service 47 can be extended to terminate at a bus interchange or terminal, so that at least there is a canteen for the drivers to makan. For example, it can serve the residential areas at Old Airport Road area, Boon Keng and Toa Payoh, and terminate at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. Just make sure that the length of one direction is not too long (ie. beyond 23km/24km) for a basic bus service.</p>
                                                      <p>Whereas for the staff in the office, I do not know. Maybe a short-term solution is to sign contract with a food catering company, to cater lunch and dinner everyday to the people working at the bus terminal. At least can tahan until when there is at least one food stall within walking distance from the bus terminal.</p>

                  <p>I counted as I looked at Sims Place Bus Terminal from the MRT, as the train traveled from Kallang to Aljunied station. I double-checked using the street view of Google Maps. There are really eight parking lots at Sims Place Bus Terminal.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is only a short walk. The walking distance between Changi Business Park Bus Terminal and the SUTD building is only around 360m, and it probably takes around 5 mins to walk there and back. This is shorter than walking at least 600m from an office in Bukit Merah to a food/hawker centre along Jalan Bukit Merah...</p>
              <p>Well, this settles lunch/dinner for the people working in the office at the bus terminal and the people driving bus service 47.</p>
              <p>However, I do not know if they aware there is a canteen nearby.</p>
