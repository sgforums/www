              <p>* Reason is lot of people board 972 at bus stop along BPJ Road
                  who transfer from 960 (Woodlands Road), 176/963/970 (Hillview), 190
                  (CCK). If 972 starts from BPJ Interchange, this connection will be
                  lost + 972 itself will need many parking lots that BPJ Interchange
                  will not be able to accommodate.</p>

              <p>If more space are needed, would suggest 970 and/or 75 to originate from the bus park too. Then 171 (if modified) would not have an excuse not to terminate at BPJ.</p>
              <p>180 can stopover at BPJ ITH as its looping point. 180 and 983 should also stop outside BPJ MRT station exit.</p>
              <p>972's arrangement seems alright, some problems would be the loss of direct access to/from Hillion (though provided by 922), and also BPJ ITH not having a service for direct access to Orchard area. MRT access would be preserved when exit C opens.</p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, it will be interesting to see if they will implement to have 2 starting places when the ITH is completed. It will also be the very first time if they really do it. Ideally all buses must go into Bukit panjang ITH except for those looping services. As mr TIB987K pointed out, it should hold 12 bus services and the rest will need to loop around. I will not suggest buses to start from and end at bus park once the ITH has begun revenue service. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, yes 12 services difficult to fit into 20 slots for Bukit panjang ITH. I am waiting to see how it is going to be done. </p>
              <p>In comparison, Punggol used to have 39 lots for 15 bus services before expansion. Soon after everything is completed, it will have 55++ with 21 new lots plus some removal due to construction of boarding and alighting bay and minor amendment of old interchange. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Your first reasoning as to why 972 would originate from the bus park doesn't makes much sense for reasons I would give below.</p>
              <p>I was initially confused as to which bus stop along Bukit Panjang Road you are referring to until I viewed it in context; it's the one at opposite Block 183. True enough, making 972 starts from the ITH would cause that bus stop to be skipped because it's the same as how 920 and 922 goes before it was closed. However, with regards to some of the services you mentioned that they transferred from (leaving aside 176 and 970 since they plied from Hillview in the same manner as 963), in some cases I have highlighted below, they could have simply transferred from the bus stop at Block 270 along the same road instead if 972 is amended to the ITH.</p>
              <p>I was dumbfounded as to why there can be foolish passengers (I could not think of a better word than 'foolish') who chose to transfer from the three bus services at the Opp Block 183 bus stop and go around loops within the estates served by the LRT before reaching destinations beyond Block 270, which is far much longer than the route taken by 190 or 960/963 between the two bus stops along Bukit Panjang Road. Of course, some of them could have been the residents served by the LRT (for CCK people, they could have stayed on 190 if they are going to Orchard); it may be based on your data and I do not have the benefit of reading them so I wouldn't comment on its accuracy, but from a practical perspective, the reasoning sounds strange to me.</p>

              <p>For Sengkang, the initial terminal did not have many service as compared to the time when the air-conditioned interchange opened (at the time of the opening, there are 13 services including Express 501 and 502 there)...I do not think it can be compared as much as Serangoon and Bukit Panjang when some of the existing services cannot even terminate there. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, okay good point for the Sengkang one which realistically cannot be compared.  </p>
              <p>For serangoon, I feel aggreived by it slightly. Service 81 and 82 were chosen to loop around serangoon. And because of 82 changing its resting place from serangoon to Punggol, end up another new service 84 was introduced for the Punggol road end sector. Literally 1 service is changed to 2 services just because serangoon int parking lots are limited. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
