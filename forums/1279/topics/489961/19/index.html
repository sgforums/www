              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I am also furious that they make the Thomson
              Marine parade line like this. So many stops in Marine parade area.
              But what can I do? However I believe many people staying in Marine
              parade are waiting for this mrt line and ditch the buses when time
              comes. For those who have alternatives, they will surely take the
              MRT. It is not that I want to offend people but this will be the
              truth one day. Sorry if I offend anybody staying in marine parade
              in this forum. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Precisely due to its stops density being so high. Ought we provide alternatives that are faster for those in the further end?</p>
              <p>And not everyone likes to change here and there between lines you know. In fact, given the nature of train transfer now majority would obviously favour a direct, express bus over trains. </p>
              <p>The reason why buses appear unappealing now is because LTA made it as such. They arent doing anything to modify the trunks and making them more suitable for point-to-point travel! Instead of trunks doing the role of being a "street service" the feeders and shorter regional trunks should be! </p>
              <p>Allow me to rehash an old narrative, but This is no longer the 80's! Where money &gt; time! Nowadays people are more willing to use money to save time, because time IS money!</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I did not say terminate all bus services. What I
              mean is in singapore, mrt is the main mode of transport to go with.
              Buses will always play a complmentary role for those places where
              MRT cannot reach. So don't speak of words with such a tone that I
              say eliminate all buses. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>By 'complementary' do you mean the importance of buses will be secondary to trains? I am curious if you prefer transfers between several different train lines or trains and buses (eg bus-train-bus) to direct buses.</p>

              <p>Precisely due to its stops density being so high. Ought we
              provide alternatives that are faster for those in the further
              end?</p>
              <p>And not everyone likes to change here and there between lines
              you know. In fact, given the nature of train transfer now majority
              would obviously favour a direct, express bus over trains. </p>
              <p>The reason why buses appear unappealing now is because LTA made
              it as such. They arent doing anything to modify the trunks and
              making them more suitable for point-to-point travel! Instead of
              trunks doing the role of being a "street service" the feeders and
              shorter regional trunks should be! </p>
              <p>Allow me to rehash an old narrative, but This is no longer the
              80's! Where money &gt; time! Nowadays people are more willing to
              use money to save time, because time IS money!</p>

              <p>It's easy to suggest that trunk services should become more express in nature because most stops along existing trunk services are quite heavily utilized by commuters, even though it is agreed that certain trunk services are really too long in nature and can be splitted up.</p>
              <p>If feeders/shorter regional trunks were to be introduced, wouldn't that mean more transfers for commuters who reside near bus stops in which the trunk services are adjusted to skip the stops, and commuters will have to take the feeder/inter-town trunk to transfer to the semi-express trunk. This would make it no different from using the train instead, since commuters would probably have to transfer about the same number of times regardless of taking the bus or train to their destinations rather than a direct bus.</p>
              <p>With that being said, the Fast Forward concept introduced by SBST in 2005 is a more economical solution that can provide faster services for commuters while not compromising necessary connections for existing trunk services and can be implemented for more trunk services to reduce travel time.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, I am a strong advocate of direct bus services. I prefer 1 bus direct instead of multiple transfers. Even if the direct sbs 85 takes me a few more minutes to Khatib mrt rather than 83 transfer to 965, I will take sbs 85. I don't like transfers as it incurs extra waiting time. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
