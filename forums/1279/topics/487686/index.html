              <p>This thread is in response to the below post by randomguy10 in the A24 thread:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(I am sorry to discuss this on the A24 topic but its a reply to what was posted above)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Yes agreed. Since the existing routes are very hard to change or remove because of public outroars due to loss of direct linkages, I would have preferred BSEP to introduce more full-day express or semi-express routes instead of all those short haul trunks that are quite poorly planned and are no more than just taking up the precious space on our already congested bus interchanges. After all BSEP was planned to provide people with alternative bus routes to solve the overcrowding on the MRT right? Moreover those short haul trunks are encouraging people to still transfer to MRT and this will never solve the overcrowding problems on our MRT lines.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The only well planned BSEP routes are 43M (though I would say this service could just do split shifts), 50, 860, 972 (and I gather 4 and 20 are also good but I havent taken before). I would attribute 972 to public pressure there and I believe that it still is the only BSEP service with a long express sector. Express Services like 502 and 518 could be introduced from other HDB towns towards Chinatown, CBD, Orchard areas and I am sure people will be willing to pay express fares for a more comfortable ride than on the congested trains. Or even Services like 5, 39, 59, 85, 161, 168, 857, 965, 966, 969, 985 when PTOs were still planning the routes. Such routes also command a better usage for the massive purchase of DD buses. When 67 sees DD buses, I believe it will become even slower and then become another service like 51 - such services are no longer viable in today's Singapore with MRT connections and should just split into 2. I dont think people will ever take 67 from CCK to tampines or 51 from JE to HG Ctrl.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Planning short haul routes and just throwing DDs there is the most disastrous thing. one problem with DDs is the dwell times due to passenger activities and DDs on short haul services only lengthen travel time. In a city like SG where you can only use DDs in large quantities due to space constraints for Bendys, the routes must be designed to maximally utilise the DD bus. Thats why HK doesnt even need bendys in the first place. LTA seems to be designing routes that are more suited for bendy/SD and dumping DDs into them and this is the sadest case. If you decided to use DD bus in large quantities, design suitable routes. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Quite a lot has been said on various threads on the nature of our bus network and the types of routes we have (long, short, express, winding etc). This thread is for more general discussions on how you think our bus network should be like, mainly about routing and connectivity issues. In response to the post by randomguy10:</p>
              <p>I don't quite agree with your last point about planning routes to utilise DDs more efficiently, it's more of vice versa (deploying DDs and/or bendies based on the suitability of the routes). However, I agree with your main point that more express or semi-express routes can be introduced to complement the MRT for long-haul travel. Short haul routes aren't bad per se; they provide important connections to shopping malls, schools and other amenities besides MRT stns, though you are right that many short routes under BSEP are designed to encourage ppl to transfer to the MRT for long-haul travel to other parts of Sg.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To start off, I'll discuss long haul routes with express sectors. There are many different categories, whether trunks like 190, 960, 168, Express, ffw, Premium, Chinatown Direct, City Direct etc. Here are some areas to look at:</p>
              <p>1. Routing</p>
              <p>We have many "express" routes from residential areas to the CBD, and some (mostly trunk svcs) connecting residential areas where MRT links are slower or not readily available, eg 966, 985, 161, 168, 965, 969. Should we have more of the former, like City Direct, Chinatown Direct or 502/518, or more of the latter, along currently unserved or underserved corridors, like CCK/BPJ - SKG/PGL, SBW - East/Northeast areas, SKG/PGL - Upper Changi/CBP etc?</p>
              <p>2. Operation hours</p>
              <p>Many routes operate only during peak hours to cater to the working crowd, like City Direct, Premium and ffw. 188R/963R operate only on weekends, while Chinatown Direct operate on weekday off peak and weekend full day. Other than 502/518, most full day "express" svcs are actually trunk routes with long express sectors, mostly connecting residential areas (those along TPE/SLE corridor). A notable exception would be the full day svcs between CCK/BPJ and city (190, 700, 960, 972), where MRT is not a viable option, at least until DTL2 MRT opens.</p>
              <p>Do you support the City Direct svcs targeted at (only) easing the peak hour MRT crowd between housing estates and the city, or do you think such svcs should operate full day? 972 is a case where a full day "express" svc is introduced after the similar peak hour svc 971E received high demand, though this is also due largely to residents' feedback.</p>
              <p>3. Fares</p>
              <p>We have normal trunk routes with express sectors, Express/ffw/City Direct svcs that charge about 1.5 times that of trunk fares, and Premium svcs with fares ranging from $3 to as high as about $6 per trip. With some City Direct svcs serving similar areas as existing Premium svcs (658/585 for Kaki Bukit, 652/548/549 for AMK etc), we can see that LTA is trying to provide a more affordable alternative to Premium svcs. But then what exactly justifies the higher fare of "Express" or even Premium svcs? Should Premium bus operators be allowed to charge any fare they want, as long as commuters are willing to pay?</p>
              <p>How about SBST Express svcs that provide unique connections along their non-express sectors, eg 502 for Jurong West - Jurong East, 506 for Bedok North - Bedok South? Should we just have more svcs with express sectors charging normal trunk fares, like 5, 48, 59, which were planned by SBST before LTA took over central bus planning?</p>

              <p>Yes I agree! 513, 850E, 951E, 971E should be made full day. And also FFW services like 14e, 30e, 74e, 97e, 151e, 174e and SMRT's 188E, 854E, 963E can consider full day too but at maybe 20-30 minute frequency. If bus transport is indeed going to serve as an alternative to MRT travel, LTA has to find routes that have comparable travel time to MRT and that people will take. Short haul routes just provide people with an access to the MRT station and this does not solve the MRT overcrowding problem. </p>

              <p>I think full day express or semi-express routes would work only if they serve areas with high full day demand, meaning routes like 513 that only go to Shenton Way area may not work. Similar to 971E/972, some City Direct or City Direct-type svcs can have full day variants skipping Shenton Way and serving Orchard, Suntec and/or Harbourfront. If not full day, then weekend and maybe weekday off peak, like 188R/963R or Chinatown Direct.</p>
              <p>Actually SBST had these CityShopper svcs quite a few years back, between housing estates and Orchard/Suntec plying expressways, which were a good idea in theory but fares were too expensive ($3 plus) so ridership was low. Such svcs may work if fares are lower, express fares ($2 plus) or even normal trunk fares. Maybe express fares to distinguish limited stop variants of existing trunk routes, and trunk fares for svcs plying small roads in residential areas with poor bus connections. (like City Direct routes)</p>
              <p>As for limited-stop svcs outside CBD areas (connecting mostly residential areas), such routes are often raised here on the route suggestions thread, though we haven't been seeing such svcs under BSEP. In theory, such routes will work only if travel time is faster than, or comparable to, the MRT, or ply corridors where the MRT is not readily available. (eg the TPE corridor)</p>
