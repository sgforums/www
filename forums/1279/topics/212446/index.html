            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I have to report to Kranji camp at 7am. Sosince I am staying in Serangoon North, I take the earliest bus svc 156 at 0533 to Raffles Town Club, cross the road. Wait for 25 min for svc 190 (probably the first bus). Transfer to svc 302 at cck interchange.<br><br>Outcome: Late by 15 min. So if I have waited for svc 190 for only 5 min, I will be still be early. Based on the bus guide at the various bus stop, I notice that first bus for 190 is at 0628. Even shocking to me is first bus for svc 960 is 0651. So if there is anybody who is going to woodlands from Raffles Town club and needs to be there probably by 7 plus, he may have to take other svcs which is more troublesome.<br><br>So just to ask, why is svc 960 starting work rather late and is there any way to reach kranji camp from serangoon nth by 7am without taking mrt?</div>

Take bus too long since you are travelling from the north east. Go to AMK only 15 mins, take train another 30 mins then walk 15 mins then You reach liao.. much much faster.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the north western parts of singapore is a bit not very accessible to ppl living in north eastern part of singapore. I hope that in the years to come, there will be some improvements.<br><br>By the way, today just try out the new route. 156 coming time: 0532. Reach at Bukit Timah Road at 0601. See svc 170 coming along the way and board it at 0601. Reach Ten Mile Junction at 0621. Run to CCK Road opposite Phoenix LRT station and take 190 at 0625. Reach CCK Interchange at 0640. Take svc 302 and alight CCK cres at 0650. Walk to Kranji camp for 2 mins. Phew!! Still early. I am quite happy that I make it.<br><br>By the way, if someone says SBST drivers are slow in the other thread, it is also not true. Today, the BC of svc 170 SBS 616A drives as though Bukit Timah Road and Upper Timah Road seems like an expressway to me. Overtake SMRT 961 along the way.</div>
