            <div class='col-md body'>Hello peepz,<br><br>Some of you might have known that 2 new unidentified buses was sighted by me at around 5.30pm at BNDEP. As I was quite busy then, I do not have the time to reply to all your queries. Allow me to elaborate more on what I have seen.<br><br>The 2 buses looked identical to the CNG buses, difference being that there aren't any gas-pods on the roof. One was in full SBST livery, while the other was in white livery. Both of them was parked inside the main depot shed. I only caught sight on the upper-half front portion of the buses, and I wasn't able to see any regos or badges on the buses. My conclusion: These 2 buses might be new B10BLEs waiting to be launch anytime soon. As the bodywork are identical to the CNG buses, I presume they are fitted with Volgren bodywork.<br><br>Last night, I took my very first VSO ride on the expressway. Boarded 9846T at around 10.15pm towards Woodlands. Contrary to many saying that the VSO was slow and 'under-performing' on the expressways, I had a great time on the bus. The bus can travel as fast as the DM3500 MK4s, if not faster (duh!).<br><br>This morning, I had another shock at Bedok Interchange. Being in a daze after a ride on 9847R from Woodlands, my eyes set upon a<br>Superbus parked beside a TIBS Habit bus. Upon looking at the service plate, I can't believe that it is SERVICE 35!. I rubbed my eyes twice and I'm sure my eyes aren't playing any tricks on me. SBS9307H is serving Service 35 at this very moment I'm posting this message.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings fellow frenz,<br><br>Much to my embarrassment, now I think I may have got the wrong bus after all. This afternoon I passed by BNDEP again, and what I saw is 999U resting in the main depot shed. Giving it a thought for a while, I realised that I may have made a mistake. But what about the other bus which is in the white livery? Did I made a mistake on that one too? I didn't see it at BNDEP today.

They will be concentrating on the phasing out of Scania N113s, Mercedes O405 and Volvo MK2s. The new batch of double deckers, I suppose, would come on after the Leyland Olympians reached 15 years of age.<br><br>As for Tibs, I don't think they will be getting more articulated buses for the moment. I wonder how they will cover the loss of 99 buses if CSS is not closing. Even with CSS closing, some of the old buses are too old to be used on Tibs fleet.</div>
