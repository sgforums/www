When SL 52 got their first buses, they all seemed to be in sorry states. Today, most of them improved. AM 52 also got an improvement. However, don't look here for a broken speed limiter.<br><br>AM 162 looks average at best. Recommend me 2804? Ok. I'll try. 2801 to me is average at best.<br></div></blockquote>52 used to have MKII, which i think is not suitable, what i find weird was all the new bishan services (52,57,58,59) all have MKII during the start, now 52 is quite a good one. SBS 2801T is good, but i will not really like it, this bus is the bus on 162 which breakdown easily, good thing about SBS 2801T is that this bus comes 5-7 mins right after SBS 2800X, but after this bus goes, SBS 2802R will come 20-30 mins later, pathetic frequency. SBS 2804K is one of the best. If you do not manage to take it, try SBS 2799S, another good bus, but i think it has vandalism on it. if you take 162, avoid SBS 2808A and SBS 2715J. SBS 2808A, if i remember, has alot of vandalism, SBS 2715J gears up very different and is much slower</div>

SBS 2801T is good too, best acceleration, good aircon, no vandalism and exterior clean, BUT its prone to breakdown and the seats a bit rusting out already.</div>
