              <p><br>Yes. SBST and SMRT cannot be expected to satisfy everyone because everyone have their own different standard. Like just now that Zenden......too high of a standard till he fall down.</p>
              <p>For me, as long as i reach the place on time and in relative comfort can already. Besides, i don't expect them to get some expensive bus and run routes while not facing jams, accidents, passenger problems etc.</p>

              <p><br>You are a joker seriously. Let me ask you one question. All buses run a fixed route (except rerouting and ffw services). If on the route they get stuck in a jam, they'll be late right? so should people who are  blame the traffic or the BCs? The BCs also cannot help it. You should be more understanding instead of expecting everything to be perfect.</p>

              <p>I think all our staff must be supermen and superwomen. We can endure all that torturing rides everyday....... and you are there to deny that we ever did.
              <br><br>
              Such incidents don't even happen on a daily basis, it's probably just the worst it could get, and the incidence rate of having to wait for 45mins is far less than 1%.
              <br><br>
              How many of them have waited more than 45mins? What is the acceptable time you would wait for a bus? If you are that impatient, why not get immediate travel with a cab? There is no such mode of travel that can offer the service of a cab and the fares of a bus in a model of self-sustainability.
              <br><br>
              But sadly, despite what the thread title is all about, it has degraded from ranting into an insult session against the bus companies and their staff. If the people do not have the self-respect to even consider what others have put in to bring about a satisfactory transport system to most people, I don't think there will ever be anything constructive coming from you.</p>

              <p>Overcrowding is a very subjective term, but we make sure we do not pack in anything more than the licenced capacity on basic feeder &amp; trunk bus services.
              <br><br>
              Speed cannot be increased any further without initiatives like schemes like bus lanes, mandatory give way to buses out of bus bays, because travelling speed of buses are greatly influenced by road conditions.
              <br><br>
              It'll be better to assume that no new express bus services will be launched in the near term as we need every bit of our resources to provide 10-min headway on basic bus services during peak hours, so that option is also out.
