              <p>That's why many people still choose to drive instead. We all know that the public transport here cmi. I know SBST buses are generally slow in their journeys, and I 'm frustrated sometimes. But before you complain, do you know the rationale behind all these??? I get to know why instead from many sources. So??? I just have to plan a bus trip ahead, take the earlier bus, so that I wouldn't be late. And there are people there who can take public bus without much problems.</p>
              <p>Those people served by SBST should be glad, especially you, because the area I lived in is served by SMRTB which is even worse and give more problems instead. But still no choice, I need to take a public bus. At least I see some slight improvements on SBST over the past 5 years or so. Ratings of public buses have increased since last year, don't you saw in the papers???</p>
              <p>Regarding to noisy and rowdy students on board of buses, I have no comments. I also cannot stand the vandalism and littering on board buses from this group of people. Most likely is that the education system here has gone bad. But this is a PUBLIC bus, what can you do??? Scold them and ask them to sit down???</p>
              <p>Generally I don't like Singapore drivers. Most of them are impatient and rowdy. They think that the road belongs to them, but still have to face these people.</p>
              <p>I don't really blame buses or even cars for slow journeys, but it is the overpopulation in this country that makes everywhere so clogged up, so crowded. What can we do??? The best thing to do is to migrate.</p>
              <p>I know you are unhappy, but please refrain comments for the bus fans in Singapore. Your first post onwards has already shown the negative side of you. Many of them know what is happening in the public bus sector. Let them do what they can to improve the services.</p>

              <p>SBST try to improve themselves, in terms of bus services and comfort, but won't it be those passengers who vandalises on buses, who make noises in buses, who eat and drink in buses makes things unpleasant in bus services, who make the efforts made wasted?</p>
              <p>i noticed in what you said, you keep saying about SBS (its already SBST, not SBS). how about SMRT then?</p>

              <p><br>Appreciate fact there is still public transport that still runs rather reliably. Some countries don't even have a reliable public transport system. Appreciate it.</p>
              <p>Late? you can't exactly blame the BCs, <strong>they sometimes also have to face the consequences of being late, like not enough time to makan or even have coffee. </strong>Driver no standard? I think they can't match up to your "high standard".</p>
              <p>Cost cutting measures? then the company you work in don't cut cost is it? They do need to make profit also. They are not some charity organisations running free and reliable bus services.</p>
              <p>Regarding China BCs they are <strong>qualified</strong> to drive a bus as they have a license for it. I believe your standard set too high already. Public transport is not some VIP transport.</p>

              <p>If the ah pek can afford to buy his own car or take cab, you think he will cycle??? You know how tedious for an old person to cycle long distances under a hot scroching weather in Singapore??? What if this ah pek is sick one day, or in a hurry, do you think he can still rely on a bike alone??? And not every old people has the capability to cycle. Moreover as you age, you will feel more tired easily. And this ah pek cycles might not because he doesn't like to take bus, maybe he doesn't like to squeeze with crowds.</p>
              <p>Bicycles cannot do everything. Imagine you wearing an office suit, cycling under the hot sun, sweating profusely and ending up smell a lot in the office. Don't compare with other countries, because Singapore has a very very hot weather. Not many people can take the heat. And what happens if it rains???</p>
              <p>And not everyone can/wants to cycle. Some do not have the abilities to cycle, some do not know how to cycle, some have fear on cycling, etc.</p>
              <p>I suggest you should end this conversation if possible, because you are beginning to irritate this group of people more.</p>
              <p>And I had done my part. I am happy to take SBST buses although there are still some usual grouches but I can live with them. Other than that, private transport also had fulfilled my needs.</p>
              <p>And stop insulting bus captains. They are also ordinary citizens like you and me, trying to make a living in this stressful, over crowded and selfish society.</p>

              <p><br>............ dont generalise all BCs as bad. Also, they face alot more people in a year compared to you. Some cause trouble for them, they also tahan.</p>
              <p> I never say that if they are late "can take it out on commuter and compromise other road user safety". They actually may sacrifice their lunch to try and keep to the schedule. You never a BC, you won't understand de. Some of them are commited personally to being a model Bus Captain. They lambat in jams, they lose time, they face unhappy passengers, they handle alot of things.</p>
              <p>And as for your cost cutting logic i agree need to have correct solution. But i disagree that SBST is compromising standards and squeezing profits. Which world you came from to come up with that??</p>
              <p>So if you think you can run a perfect bus company, i dare you, literally. They can provide a scheduled service everyday, good enough already for me. If i know i may run late, leave early.</p>

              i think you're the one who's torturing yourself by choosing to look at the world through the hole of a pin and not even bothering to check your facts.</p>

              <p><br>Sadly, your standards way exceeds the what normal people usually expects. Too high and too ridiculous. Be careful not to fall from the high expectations...oh i think you just did a few posts earlier.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>People expect safe ride from point A to point B in a car, but i think your standard of safe ride will be having bodyguards, armored cars and police escorts to be safe.</p>
