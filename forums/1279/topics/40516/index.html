Sometimes, some bus services could have lonnger frequency, because of the traffic conditions, loading and unloading of passengers, and the speed the drivers are driving at.<br><br>Regarding abt Service 105, it sometimes got jammed up along C'wealth Ave West, or even Orchard Rd. As a result, the frequency of the bus can be drastically long...</div>

More and more people started cramming into the bus shelter.<br><br>20 minutes passed, no bus came. Some people decided to walk instead of waiting for the bus.<br><br>30 minutes passed, no bus came. People were dying to kill the bus driver.<br><br>40 minutes passed, finally a Mercedes Benz came. Bus was half-full, but driver overshot the bus shelter causing all the passengers to have to walk out to the bus in the rain (did I say it was heavy?).<br><br>45 minutes later...

People were dying to kill the bus driver.<br><br>40 minutes passed, finally a Mercedes Benz came. Bus was half-full, but driver overshot the bus shelter causing all the passengers to have to walk out to the bus in the rain (did I say it was heavy?).<br><br>45 minutes later... As the bus was turning into Serangoon Avenue 2, I noticed that another 105 was behind my bus, almost empty. I still remember the bus I took. SBS 488 C. I was so hopping mad (I was dripping mad and still had to stand) I nearly went to the control station to make a complain!</div></blockquote>Sv. 105 headways are always like that for some unknown reason.</div>

There are only 13 buses during weekdays and Saturday mornings, and 11 buses during Sundays <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> The 2 buses are the Split Shift buses which goes off service after weekday evening and the 2 buses are used for chartered services on Saturday evenings. One of the churches are using them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
