            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday, I boarded Bus 32 (SBS63U) heading for the direction towards Bedok at about 1.30pm during heavy raining.<br><br>This BC driver sometimes exceeded 50km/h and kept speeding and speeding. Big water splash can be seen from the windows side. The bus feel like "shaking" whenever this driver is speeding. And the brake is quite strong to slow down when the bus is approaching the bus-stop. It's dangerous as it was raining very heavy and most parts of road is about 5 - 10cm submerged with water.<br><br>Not only that, this BC even tailgated rubbish collection truck that the bus front is too close to the back of truck. Also tailgate several cars until the bus front is very close to the back side of a car at traffic junction.<br><br>And the bus has only 5 passengers including myself at that time.<br><br>This driver is in 20s.<br><br>So scary...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Rather slow driver.<br>But on both Monday and Wednesday, he was asked to do extra rounds on 9363U (PM peak of S shift) as there is a lack of manpower...<br><br>But 9363U's perm BC is definitely pro! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He is able to maintain below 25min rounds on almost every 179 round! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> But that guy like everytime pon work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OMG.. Today I took Svc 179 and I am late for work!! Haiz.. Took SBS 9092B today (Driven By the BC wearing hat)(He drive very slow...). There was a massive jam along Pionner Rd Nth to AYE direction. I board this bus at Blk 834 at 7.55am and stuck at pionner rd nth for a long time and only reach the int at about 8.15am.. The order of sequences . First bus, SBS 9031C reach the int first and quickly go back on service on svc 179.. Second bus, SBS 9092B keep stopping and let passenger board the bus along JW st 63.. I was super "Tu lan" that time when I was late but he stop at every stops along JW st 63 when SBS 373A ehich was behind it did nt stop at all.  Third bus, SBS 373A overtake SBS 9092B at JW st 63 and did not stop but just go straight back to interchange.<br><br>The happy thing is during the PM peak, I board the pro BC bus.. He was driving SBS 9067A today.. hahaz.. Took one round along Jw St 91.. He just accelerate all the way along JW st 91.. Pro sia!!</div>

The Big hat one depends on his mood... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If he want to waste time, he damn pro at wasting time. Last time, he took 15-20mins to enter NTU from BNL, driving at around 10km/h along Pioneer Rd Nth.<br><br>But if he want to chiong, he can chiong too. Today, on his final PM peak round, he managed to catch up with 9291T and 7209X in front of him.<br><br>Anyway, this week, 373A should be driven by the tall and skinny guy I recommended somewhere above in this thread. But for the past 2 days, 373A driven by Standby BC. Maybe you tomorrow try your luck, see whether he got drive 373A or not.</div>
