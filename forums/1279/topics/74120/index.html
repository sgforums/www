If you ask me, Tibs is lying about this. CCK gets all the old buses.<br><br>Fot the Box MB0405  series: CCK gets all the first few batch of these buses..TIB4xx-5xx<br><br>For the DAF, it's all handed over to CCK services, DAF is a lousy type of bus.<br><br>For Habits, CCK gets the older batch: TIB10xx-1210<br><br>For Box Bendys, they r already old. they are all given to CCK!<br><br>See how big a liar Tibs is, all the new buses goes to their flagship areas, Woodlands and Yishun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

But I still say 307 is the most important service in Choa Chu Kang. One reason for 300 having a high load is that Bt Panjang Govt High School is there. Many people go to that school. Another reason is that 300 travel in certain places where there are no alternative service for passengers to board <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
