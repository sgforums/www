              Quality 
                          
              but not in a way that the photographer starts being inflexible while attempting to capture the shot; barring any dangerous stunts/variables.
                          
              And to a certain group of people not to keep pushing, or "advising" in their term, their standard angle theory/ head too big etc when there are infinite possibilities of composing. It could be the way people inteprete photos.
                      
              Edit: Point to ponder for everyone: i learnt about the Parent,child and adult ego, that can explain a lot of such stuffs and flame wars/ refusal to admit/ criticize etc.

              Given the example of Samuel Solitaire in the feb photo thread,let's all ponder on this for a moment.
              
              keep giving criticisms and harsh "advices" I.e head too big, it'll turn into another vicious, pointless cycles.
              
              give constructive and positive advice, and patiently guide. Hey, some are slow to learn, some are fast to pick up.
              
              we all started off with little or no exp in photography, we probably had advices/tips or guides somewhere that helped us along in learning.

              <p>It's great to see such a thread around to address this issue. (:</p>
              <p>And as what you have mentioned (in the quote), if it blocks almost half of the bus, I think it's best to avoid posting such pictures as there is defintely room for improvement, and besides, someone may have a better shot of it anyway. But mentioning all these, it's still up to the photographer as to how the photograph conveys the message across.</p>

              <p>I came across a quote from another forum (It's an UK-based openBVE community. The user said that if you have a large album of images, most are bad save for a few good ones, people will pick more on the bad images than they do for the good ones. Hence, he rather upload just 2 or 3 quality images, than an entire album of photos.</p>
              <p>Have to say I agree with it, which is why I stopped dumping albums of images online, instead focusing on the quality images, cropping, enhancing, and watermarking them.</p>
              <p>Is it a general opinion that what I say above is true? Anyone who disagrees? :)</p>
              <p>(I'm not trying to, nor do I have the intention of, trying to start a war with this question... I just want a healthy discussion...) </p>

              <p>But to think of it, it's true. I myself stopped uploading photos into some photo-sharing sites but instead, keep it in my own personal desktop folder. </p>
              <p>Also, if that person was to actually pay attention at his pictures and take feedbacks about his pictures and work on improving his photography skills, he will see how he has developed over time. </p>
              <p>He may suck at taking photos at first, but over time, he will end up taking photos that a professional photographer takes. You don't need to own a DSLR to take quality photos. A simple digital camera is already good enough. Just makeado with the settings there.</p>
              <p>People pick at the bad ones because they know that the person can take better pictures than that. And hence, they should guide that person, instead of shooting that person down with a gun. Caring is sharing and sharing is caring. Sharing knowledge is something that is free (don't talk about school or tuitions, that's a different story altogether.) </p>
              <p>Talk is cheap. It's better that they prove it with their actions.</p>
              <p>Just my 2cents worth :)</p>
