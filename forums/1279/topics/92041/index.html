            <div class='col-md body'>London underground is one of the oldest subways, being built in the 1800s. It is much much lousier than singapores MRT, so we have no reason to complain abt the trains. I feel that SMRT and SBST has done a good choice in purchasing the trains, like alstom, kawasaki and siemens.</div>
