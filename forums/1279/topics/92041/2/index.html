In Busy stations like City Hall, Raffles Place, Bugis, Orchard etc.. during the peak Hour.. when a particular train arrive at the station.. there can be more than a hundred ppl using the escalator at the same time.. to make things worst.. sometimes, Trains from both direction arrive at the same time.. it can get really Crowded.. So.. when the Keep Left rule is used, it can at least help to speed things up abit... making ppl moving on.. Like what youve said, Teens and young Adults likes to hold Hands and bunch together.. Well.. youve just said.. its just 10 seconds.. they can just let go for that 10 seconds and resume what they do as usual after they have left the escalator... For some people.. time is very important to them.. So.. what IMO, the KEep Left Rule Is better to stay then go...</div>
