Many trainsets are squeaking and creaking. Plus, I feel they need a new paintjob. There are already some trains that were painted with a bluish-grey coat and I hope SMRT would finish re-painting the rest of them soon.<br><br>The Siemens are nice, smooth and quiet. I don't hear much noise from them as compared to the Kawasaki units. Also, it has a unique MBO405 kinda sound when it is stopping. The one funny thing is its chime. It sounds like a 7-Eleven store! The Kawasaki chime is more pleasant to hear.<br><br>Speaking of Siemens, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB, aka Malayan Railway) will be getting new Siemens locomotives which are scheduled for delivery in August. These locomotives are built in China by the Dalian Locomotive and Rollingstock Works.<br><br>Did you know that KTMB also have Kawasaki locomotives? They were built in collaboration with Toshiba and were delivered in 1985. Named the 24 Class, they are the most powerful KTMB locomotive until the arrival of the German Blue Tiger in 2003. Powerful they may be, the 24 Class have been plagued with reliability issues.</div>

According to the technical info, it has a maximum speed of 145 km/h. It's a different story when pulling 10-15 odd carriages but with a maximum power output of 2940 kW, it shouldn't have much of a problem. Anyway, the maximum permitted speed on the main line is 100 km/h while on the East Coast branch line is 90 km/h.</div>
