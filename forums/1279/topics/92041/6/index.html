The conditions of the first 10-year lease state that SMRT must pay an annual rental for the lease of the train fleet and upon expiration of the lease term may be required to purchase the rolling stock at its book value. As a pioneer company, SMRT enjoyed tax exempt status. The SMRT must also set aside funds for the replacement or overhaul of major capital assets required to operate the MRT system."<br><br>"The SMRT's 10-year licence and operating contract with LTA to operate the<br>MRT system expired on 26 August 1997 and was extended by the LTA to 31 March 1998 (the end of LTA's financial year). LTA signed a new 30-year licence and operating agreement with SMRT which commenced on 1 April 1998. Under the new LOA, which will be reviewed every 5 years, SMRT will pay a licence fee to the LTA each year. As part of the agreement, the operating assets for the MRT system were sold at net book value to the SMRT, with the proceeds from the sale of $1.2 billion payable in five equal instalments from 1998 to 2002. At the same time, the LTA provided the SMRT with a grant amounting to $480 million to help SMRT purchase the assets (1999 Annual Reports of LTA and SMRT)."<br><br>quote from <a href="http://web.mit.edu/ctl/www/research/utc/Sing%20Trans%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/ctl/www/research/utc/Sing%20Trans%20Final.pdf</a>.<br><br>note that from NEL onwards, it became like this:<br><br>"The study process for the development of the first stage of the MRT was extremely long and detailed, comprising the better part of a decade. While the government wanted Singapore to have a healthy and vibrant public transport system, it did not wish public transport to be a continual drain on government funds. The bus system in Singapore had always operated (and continues to operate) without direct public subsidy. Fares and other non-operating revenue must cover the costs of operating the system, including the replacement cost of buses as they reach the end of their useful life. The Â“universal service obligationÂ” imparts a requirement for the bus companies to offer some services<br>that are not financially viable, but these routes are cross-subsidized by other parts of the companyÂ’s operations. The financial viability of the proposed rail system was one of the key elements of the MRT studies. Most rail systems in North America and Europe are heavily subsidised by the government. In the United States, for example, public transport systems rarely recover more than 50% of the operating costs from users. To improve the financial sustainability of the proposed rail system in Singapore, service would be limited to the<br>Central Business District and outlying areas with heavy demand. The government insisted that the revenue generated from MRT fares should cover operating and maintenance costs, including the replacement of operating assets like rolling stock. Put differently, if the government paid for the capital cost of the project, the system should be able to continue to operate indefinitely without further financial help from the government.<br><br>"Consistent with this philosophy, the government funded the construction cost of the long-term MRT infrastructure Â– tunnels, viaducts and stations. The government also funded the first set of operating assets, including trains and signalling systems, that would be expected to wear out and require replacement after about 30 years of operation. Commuter fares were set to cover the day-to-day operating cost of the MRT and, under the Licence and Operating Agreement (LOA), the SMRT was required to make annual deposits to an Assets Replacement Reserve that would accumulate funds to replace the<br>original equipment with a second set in due course. In the 1996 White Paper, the LTA moved away from this financing approach because it was felt that asset inflation placed the burden of paying for the future operating assets on<br>the present generation of commuters. Assuming an asset inflation of 5%, the LTA estimated that the first set of operating assets, which had cost S$1.6 billion when the system was constructed in 1987, would cost S$6.9 billion by 2017 when they were due for replacement. The LTA recognized that a sharply higher fare would be required if the new assets were to be supported by deposits to the Asset Replacement Reserve.<br><br>"The LTA White Paper proposed to revise the requirement for asset replacement as follows:<br><br>"The Government to continue funding infrastructure and the first set of<br>operating assets, and commuters to continue paying fares which cover<br>operating costs including depreciation. However, the second set of operating<br>assets will be financed by fare revenue covering only the historical cost of the<br>first set of operating assets, while Government co-finances the balance.<br>Thus, when the present operating assets are due for replacement in 2017 at a cost of S$6.9 billion, the operator would pay S$1.6 billion while the government would pay the remaining S$5.3 billion. In another 30 years, when the second set of assets would be due for replacement, the Asset Replacement Reserve will have to come up with S$6.9 billion and the government will again pay the inflationary costs. In this way, each generation would pay for the operating assets that they consume.<br><br>"The LTA White Paper was presented to Parliament on 2 January 1996 and was approved by the government soon after."<br><br>North-East Line (NEL) was approved by the Cabinet on 16th January 1996, 2 weeks after the approval of the LTA White Paper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tamago: I had a read of the full version of the article you quoted. It was released in 1999, before SBS won the NEL tender. I wonder what does the author/s have to comment on having more than one subway operator here when some larger cities have a subway/commuter rail monopoly in place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The following article was quoted in another forum more than one year ago, but i thinks it is still relevant, so i puts it here again. however, it looks like they are not going to change. i dont know if the presently higher bus and MRT fares has got anything to do with this..<br><blockquote><span class="large">Govt must steer the necessary MRT U-turn</span><br><br>By Christopher Tan<br><br>When is it justified for the state to interfere in the affairs of a listed company? Clearly, one occasion would be when that company is in a position to influence national welfare.<br><br>In the public transport domain, the players are listed entities. But they operate within a regulatory framework, unlike, say, a popiah-skin maker or water treatment firm. In the framework lies non-commercial clauses and conditions.<br><br>For instance, these companies cannot charge their customers more any time they feel like it - even if they are the only game in town. Neither can they serve only lucrative routes and ignore the rest. Many operate with an implicit contract that dictates thin margins in return for the privilege of monopoly and, more importantly, guaranteed economic viability.<br><br>Whether or not that contract is adhered to can be debated another time; for now, the issue has to do with our budding rail network.<br><br>In Parliament last week, when MPs questioned the wisdom of the Government seemingly directing SMRT and SBS Transit to merge their rail operations, Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong stood up to clarify that he had 'at no time' done so.<br><br>Well, there would be absolutely nothing wrong if he did do so. Do we need more than one MRT operator? Apparently we did; and we had convincing arguments for it. But after a rethink, perhaps we don't - and we had equally convincing reasons for that too.<br><br>Conditions have changed; the city is small, ridership modest, and having more than one operator would only duplicate overheads - which, in the case of the rail business, can be exceedingly high.<br><br>SBS Transit, for instance, has sunk an estimated $100 million into the North-East Line (NEL), which it operates with a staff of 600 people.<br><br>Monthly operating cost of the 20km line is $7 million, or $84 million a year. Based on an average fare of 85 cents and a daily ridership of 175,000, fare revenue comes up to $53.5 million a year.<br><br>Assume advertising revenue of $10 million, and you still end up with an operating loss of $20 million for the first year. Against the backdrop of its initial investments - and the prospects of rising capital expenditure as the trains age - it'll be a long time before SBS gets its money back on this venture.<br><br>But here's the thing. Even if SMRT takes over the operation tomorrow, the cost of duplication has already been incurred and cannot be made to go away just like that. <span style="color: blue;">On the other hand, if we're of the view that other problems might fester if things are left as they are, </span>then we should act.<br><br>In fact, we are already seeing some undesirable fallout of a two-operator network: unopened stations, higher fares for those who ride the NEL, <span style="color: blue;">and possibly higher fares for those who use the rest of the MRT network</span>.<br><br>What next? <span style="color: blue;">Fewer bus services? Bus fares costlier than they need to be? Deteriorating service standards?</span><br><br>But how do we resolve this? SMRT obviously would not want to pay for a loss-making entity and has said so. And SBS is unlikely to want to give up the business without being compensated in some way for its investments. <span style="color: blue;">Hence neither side will move unless the Government steps in.</span> And for the long-term interest of commuters, it should step in.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">It was the Government which facilitated 'competition' in the rail business in the first place. So, too, must it undo the situation if it believes it is untenable.</span> To put it metaphorically, it should not let go of the steering wheel as we negotiate this U-turn.<br><br>For Singaporeans, who have forked out $5 billion for the NEL, the cost of the rethink will just have to be written off as an expensive lesson in transport economics. But if we don't grit our teeth and do it, we will never admit that this was a mistake and be able to move on.<br><br>To think that a resolution should be purely a commercial prerogative is just prolonging the charade.</blockquote>if SMRT run NEL then it will has experience in running automated driverless line by the time CCL open</div>

In another 30 years, when the second set of assets would be due for replacement, the Asset Replacement Reserve will have to come up with S$6.9 billion and the government will again pay the inflationary costs.
