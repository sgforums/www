            <div class='col-md body'>I think that the reason why there is low ridership of NEL is that for the North East line, if people living in Sengkang for example, wishes to go to Woodlands, they will not take NEL and transfer to NSL. They can board bus 161 or 965. Similarly, if they want to go to the Eastern region of Singapore, they wouldn't take the NEL either. They can take bus 27, 88, 89. NEL is only linked to the NSL once and EWL once at Dhoby Ghaut and Outram Park respectively while NSL is linked to the EWL thrice at Jurong East and City Hall and Raffles Place. Besides that, NEL runs places that are still under developed.</div>

It was a failure. Simply sucks! Main<br><br>con almost got into 'trouble' wif the LTA.<br><br></div></blockquote>What actually made Siemens trains a failure though??<br><br>============<br><br>This is my full report and analysis on all the types of MRT trains operating right now.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong (below):<br><br>Ok, I know that there are 3 train types (2 painted in white with red logos, one fully<br><br>black)<br><br><strong>1. Kawasaki</strong><br>These trains were the first to ply since the beginning of the MRT system. They have<br><br>been the only type operating till the year end of 1996 when SMRT bought Siemens trains.<br><br>After 2000, when the Kawasaki trains were operating with the Siemens and the "black,<br><br>refurbished, and super-new" trains, most of them started adopting ads on the trains<br><br>...probably to hide the fact that they're ageing??<br><br><strong>Spotting a Kawasaki train</strong><br>Exterior:<br>FRONT - Every train has a number assigned to it (eg. train #012) and is displayed on<br><br>something which I like to call a <span style="font-style: italic;">billboard</span>. On this train, it is located on the<br><br>right side, front, top of the the train. The billboard is of the old-school type where<br><br>the individual digits ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) are plastic signage that are manually cranked<br><br>(turned) if the operator wants to change the train number. Think casino jackpot machine<br><br>- the numbers spinning. It's something like that. Also, it is lighted by a normal bulb<br><br>(emits yellowish light).<br><br>Interior:<br>Clean, but the interior is a bit dull. The wood paneling on the floor looks<br><br>like...well...a bark of a tree.<br><br>The glass paneling at the sides of the train doors have straight tops. Put it simply,<br><br>it's just a simple piece of square glass, no funny angles (compared to the Siemens<br><br>trains, which I will describe later).<br><br>Look up above the doors. The cornices at the top of the doors (that is, the top<br><br>opposite corners of the train) are curved at the cornice ends.<br><br>Engine and environment: Out of the 3 trains compared, the volume of the Kawasaki's<br><br>engine is ranked 2nd loudest.<br><br>When it goes through a curve, not much sound proofing. The steel wheels makes a lot of<br><br>scraping ("pshh pshh") sounds as it negotiates a curved train track. Centrifugal force<br><br>dampening is weak; the train "bounces" heavily to the direction of the curve and back.<br><br>====================================<br><br><strong>2. Siemens</strong><br>Bought in the year end of 1996 (the Woodlands North-South line wasn't completed yet,<br><br>but would be in a short time), these trains looked the same as the old Kawasakis.<br><br>Seriously, in my opinion, it wouldn't be surprising if people actually can't<br><br>differentiate between these two. However, there are a few differences for those who<br><br>actually observe and listen:<br><br><strong>Spotting a Siemens train</strong><br>Exterior:<br>FRONT - Don't bother looking at the train's exterior body, you can't tell the<br><br>difference (but I know on careful inspection the body is different from the Kawasaki<br><br>and the refurbished "black" train). However you can look at the number billboard:<br><br>On this train, it is located on the right side, front, top of the the train (same as<br><br>the Kawasakis). The billboard however, is electronic. It is a yellow dot-matrix<br><br>electronic screen where every dot (or pixel) is actually a paper pixel that flips to<br><br>display either a yellow or a black:<br><br>Don't understand? It's the same as the electronic bus number billboards used in SMRT<br><br>buses.<br><br>Still don't understand? If you see a billboard with 3 yellow numbers (back-lighted by a<br><br>white fluoroscent light), then that train is a Siemens.<br><br>Interior:<br>Clean, colors are brighter.<br><br>The floors near the exit doors have black strips of sandpaper to prevent you from<br><br>falling down if your shoes are wet.<br><br>The glass paneling at the sides of the train doors look like a slab of glass...It's<br><br>just that it looks like one of its sides have been cut off and now it faces 45 degrees.<br><br><div>code:<pre><br>__________<br>/          |  &lt;-- left corner appears "cut-off"<br>/            |<br>|             |<br>|             |<br>|             |<br>|             |<br>--------------<br></pre></div><br><br>The cornices at the top of the doors are flat and detailess, and face 45 degrees.<br><br>Look carefully at any of the windows. It's tinted a bit green. Also, on the bottom<br><br>corners of the windows are engraved text on who manufactured the windows. If it says<br><br><strong>GlastrÃ¶sh</strong> then its highly likely you're on a Siemens train.<br><br>Engine and environment:<br>Out of the 3 trains compared, the volume of the Siemens' engine is ranked the loudest.<br><br>However it's not the sound that causes ear-piercing pain; nothing of that sort. It's<br><br>the loud lower pitch whine of the engine when accelerating from stationary/decelerating<br><br>to stationary.<br><br>When it goes through a curve, sound proofing satisfactory. The steel wheels makes a<br><br>noticeable amount of scraping ("pshh pshh") sounds as it negotiates a curved train<br><br>track. Centrifugal force dampening is ok; the train still "bounces" though, but not<br><br>enough for people to start "dancing" to the left and right.<br><br>====================================<br><br><strong>3. Refurbished new "Black" trains (don't know the name)</strong><br><br>These trains started appearing in 2000 (??). I also got a brochure out from SMRT's<br><br>newest train back then. The brochure promised passengers that the trains have<br><br>improvements compared to the original trains like more standing room, announcement-<br><br>system speakers with lots of clarity, etc... which I will be explaining in the next few<br><br>paragraphs.<br><br><strong>Spotting this new "black" train</strong><br>Exterior:<br><br>SIDES - Seems to me that SMRT took a number of Kawasaki train bodies, painted it black,<br><br>then put it back during refurbishment.<br><br>FRONT - On this train, the number billboard is located on the right side, front, top of<br><br>the the train (same...). Like the Siemens train, the billboard is electronically<br><br>operated. The very obvious difference is that the numbers are in orange. Every pixel on<br><br>this dot-matrix screen are actually bright orange LED lights (unlike Siemens'<br><br>black/yellow paper pixel technology).<br><br>It's the same technology for Singapore's traffic lights. All dotted LED lights.<br><br>To compliment this sleek billboard, the front body of the train has been changed. Head<br><br>on, the front is slanted a bit to improve aerodynamics, and the paneling is bright<br><br>white too, coupled with smart sleek lines. I like to call this the "Mercedes C Class"<br><br>refurbished version of the Kawasaki trains.<br><br>Interior:<br>Clean, colors are brighter, architecture (colors) are very artistic.<br><br>I don't know whether the floors near the exit doors have black strips of sandpaper to<br><br>prevent you from falling down if your shoes are wet...better ride one to find out...<br><br>The glass paneling at the sides of the train doors look like those in Kawasaki's<br><br>trains...<br><br>What's good about these trains are that they offer:<br>- Fat seat space (less seats <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> )<br>- Center Vertical Handlebars: Instead of one pole for people to grab on, each and every<br><br>single pole branch out to 3 poles. So more hands can hold a pole.<br>- Red LED lights on top corners of the exits blink when doors are about to close.<br>- Speakers announcing the train stations and misc have been upgraded. Announcements now<br><br>sounds clearer.<br>- Lower "emergency" buttons near the doors.<br>- LCD TV screens at the train's 2 cornices below each of the passenger windows.<br>- Exterior: The center pivot points (articulations) joining 2 train carriages have<br><br>strong but flexible rubber to stop people from falling in.<br>- To compliment in-MRT announcements, LCD billboard newstickers on the ceilings!! They<br><br>scroll animated text telling you what's the next station, where the train will<br><br>terminate, etc...<br><br>Engine and environment:<br>The softest, when it comes to engine sound. It is acheived probably by soundproofing<br><br>the engine so all you hear is an almost quiet high pitch whine on<br><br>acceleration/deceleration.<br><br>However, during passenger embarkation/disembarkation I also noticed there's a sound<br><br>associated with air being released ("shhhhhhhhhhh sound"). My prediction is the train's<br><br>advanced suspension adjusting itself to the weight of the train.<br><br>During transit and sometimes when negotiating curves, the train might make the<br><br>abovementioned sound.<br><br>When it goes through a curve, sound proofing is very good. The steel wheels makes a<br><br>small amount of scraping sounds as it negotiates a curved train track. Centrifugal<br><br>force dampening is also good; the train "bounces" the least.<br><br>==================<br><br>Hope you enjoyed the report. If on the MRTs you notice behaviour different from what<br><br>I've just described, share it with us.<br><br>gotAirbus</div>
