Isn't it better to commence revenue servce immediately (possible in mature estates) instead of waiting for surrounding new estates to spring up while the system sits idling into the uncertain future? Also; a new system which sits idling due to lack of demand will not generate any revenue and will only incur daily maintenance and overhead costs which cannot be avoided.<br><br>Of course, constructing an LRT system in an already mature estate will definitely cause some inconvenience to the residents there. But I believe it's worth tolerating some inconvenience temporarily, because once it's completed, many people will stand to benefit from the LRT in the many years to come.<br><br>At least, the inconvenience due to LRT construction is far lesser than those experienced by HDB dwellers whose flats and precincts are undergoing the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP).</div>

When all the flats are up and everyone has moved in, the boys @ SBST will get the ridership they want. Currently, there is a slump in demand for new houses.

If not it's the number of unique sections before the train reaches the next station or after the previous station.<br><br>3) 1xxx for blue, 2xxx for green, 3xxx for purple/orange. x0xx and x1xx are for 1st generation Kawasaki Nippon Sharyo (KNS) trains, x2xx are 2nd generation Siemens trains, x3xx are 3rd generation KNS 2001 trains. as a train uses 2 unique numbers for the last 3 digits, the odd wan is always the smaller number, i.e. 3051, 1051, 2051, 2052, 1052, 3052.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know. Furthermore my home overlooks JE and Chinese Garden stations, so i saw this 12 carriage "snake" move slowly from the East towards Boon Lay. I initially presumed the train will tow it to the end of the line at Boon Lay there and wait till the service ends. Isn't that a better solution??</div>
