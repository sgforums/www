They even hesitated with upping the speed limit to 90km/h, so why have trains faster than 85km/h (max. speed of our MRT)?<br><br>Unless Malaysia agrees to have one pan-Malaysia railway that runs to Singapore, then u'll see it. But tat one I think also impossible. Maybe an extension to KLIA's ERL seems more practical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gazette05:</div><div class="quote_body">got any diff in the spd of PGL bound trains at SGR? i dun seem to feel it...<br><br>anyway, the avr dist to each NEL station is actually not 3-4 mins. it's only abt 1-2 mins, but the braking part takes up at least 15 to 20 secs more than NSL trains. (it's annoying).<br><br>why it seems that 3-4 mins per station is becos of the out-of-service stations like woodleigh and buangkok. besides, the dist from outram to harbourfront is twice the avg dist bwt NEL stations. in fact, the avg dist bwt NEL stations is minute compared to the woodland extension. eg bwt kranji and yew tee can fit in at least 2 more NEL stations.</div></blockquote>note that for station-to-station timings, it is defined as the time taken from one reference point (maybe say doors open or depature etc) at one station to the next station.<br><br>regarding the travel time between stations on the NEL, it varies greatly actually. in fact, while SMRT does its best to keep station-to-station timings in minutes (a gd example is the long dist between novena &amp; toa payoh and somerset &amp; dhoby ghaut, yet the trains travel faster jus to meet 2 mins and 1 min respectively), SBST's timings are controlled by computers are made to conform to almost-precise seconds of travel time.<br><br>however, it is 1) those long out-of-service sector runs and 2) the more gradual deceleration taking up more time between short station-to-station distance runs that make a ride on NEL seems so painstakingly long.<br><br>as for distance, no point comparing as 1) distance is not really a factor in the placement of stations and 2) longer distance may not necessarily translate into proportionately longer travel time but rather the scheduling controls how fast a train shall travel.</div>
