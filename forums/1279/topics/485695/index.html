              <p>SINGAPORE: SBS Transit will raise fares for its 
                  non-basic bus services from Aug 3, 2014, after the Public Transport 
                  Council (PTC) gave the greenlight.</p>
              <p>In a statement on Friday (July 
                  11), SBS said its non-basic bus services - Nite Owl, Parks, Chinatown, 
                  Direct and Premium - will have their fares revised from Aug 3. The 31 
                  Premium bus services will see the highest fare hike, with adult fares 
                  increasing between 20 cents and 70 cents.</p>
              <p>The full list of fare revisions are listed below:</p>

              <p>Hi mr busAnalayser, yes you can request to scrap the P services and some of the loss making city direct services. However you cannot deny the fact that there are other improvements for existing services and new services too. So in the end, they will still increase fares for non-basic services which are mostly losing money. Somehow, money must come from somewhere. They cannot do it on the basic services so they do it on the non-basic services. What can you do?</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, you may be right but this sort of issue will never just stop by itself. What is seen as non value added to you might be an important choice in bus selection in another resident views. He or she may need it as a substitute to avoid other crowded buses. So residents on various parts of Singapore will most likely benefit overall. Some a bit, some much more, some not at all (because they do not use public transport). </p>
              <p>Those city direct and P services are more of an experiment to try out outsourcing to prepare for the future. With or without these services, bus fares will definitely rise. No longer fall. As they cannot increase fares on basic services, they implement on non-basic services. This clearly shows the bus companies are feeling the strain heavily and one day should they are unable to cope with, more drastic measures may be taken. Cheers.</p>

              <p>All, there is no free lunch in the world. There are so many
              improvements and new bus services (be it BSEP or P buses or city
              direct buses). So of course fares will definitely be raised, even
              if it is only for non-basic services. So instead of crying over
              split milk, all we can hope is there are new bus services
              benefitting your estate or even best your home. This will somehow
              offset the anger or the disappointment which you may feel.
              Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, no issue. I also don't like fare increases. I also agree that some improvements are not up to standard. Cheers. </p>
