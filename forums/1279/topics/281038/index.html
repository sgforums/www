What makes you think people will really join you in your new website? I mean, you're not exactly getting support by the bus enthusiasts themselves by posting this so called "announcement"... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And as the others say it, you do sound immature. Problems like this is common in most forums, with a moderator, it is usually solved. Why can't this forum have the same thing done? I'm sure you do know that this was once a glorious forum, but the original members left it for a private forum, and thus it went this way. They wanted to close it but Jason refused and declared it a "public" forum. Now, even some of them who left are seen trickling back to help out here, Why would he close such a great but unfortunately spammed forum now?</div>
