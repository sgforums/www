              <p><br>But its better to put 1 bendy at this slot. Because there is no gaurantee and we do not know when will have lots of students/people and when will not during the PM peak hours. So, I think SMRT could possibly take it as a precaution by putting a bendy, if not, people will continue to complain about 966 again.</p>

              <p><br>Frm my daily experience, if there is no bus arriving between 7.45am to 7.55am at JW St 91. The load can fill up one DD and1K230UB previously, 2 DD currently at BLK 953. That's why during random checks, the bus inspector is scheduled at that bus stop until 8.30am..  Sometimes, I think the management had neglected the crowd after 7.45am which is relatively high. I had heard many complaints raised during this period.</p>

                  <p>fill up jus nice, but does a fully packed bus (often happens after PM peak) equate to a lot of people using the service? you have to count the number of trips too.... the number of pax before 7.45am could probably fill up more buses to the brim, and faster too, than just 1 DD and 1 KUB.</p>
                  <p>random checks are meant to cover the tapering off period too in case he didn't see the full picture. stopping the check at 8.30am also doesn't mean anything, it could be from instructions based on already known loading data, that he should stay on till 8.30am because it is known the pax loading will decrease after 7.45am but he should have a reasonable buffer. a 15-minute buffer is not impossible, but if the load only tapers after 8.15am, i think he could stay longer since he's already stationed there....</p>

              <p>fully packed means there are only 2-3 seats left at the upper deck and the lower deck is packed to the door. If delay does happen, the bus will be fully packed even after the stop at BLK 924.  Sometimes, the 2nd bus will have the same situation( Where there are CHC members). With close to 100 over passengers onboard, I believe the loading is rather high for a feeder service that ply such a short route. More importantly, there are always no loading issue from 6am to 7.30am when crossovers are in place. In fact, most of the complaints I heard are no buses arriving between 7.48am to 8am or 7.50am to 8.10am when some of the crossover left and there are shortage of buses or buses unable keep on their schedule.</p>
              <p>Sir, I believe he had received instructions to stay until 8.30. I will consider the loading after 8.30am as normal or low. Normal means a KUB can fetch all the passengers after looping at JW St 91 &amp; 92. To be frank,  I am living at the site area and I believe I am very sure of the situation.</p>

              <p>i suggest you ask your SLBP acquiantances to put in a request citing the data &amp; observations, if there is a need to add a bus or sacrifice trips on sv179. actually, if you have heard of these complaints thru SLBP, they'd have been doing something. if not then you can forward to them.</p>

              <p>Why not complain to MP and see what he can do for you, just to add 1 or 2 trips between the 0745-0800 period. If that means a sacrifice of about 2 buses from 179, then students are not able to get to their 8.30 class on time. Then the student union will complain.</p>

              <p>fully packed means there are only 2-3 seats left at the upper deck and the lower deck is packed to the door. If delay does happen, the bus will be fully packed even after the stop at BLK 924.  Sometimes, the 2nd bus will have the same situation( Where there are CHC members). With close to 100 over passengers onboard, I believe the loading is rather high for a feeder service that ply such a short route. More importantly, there are always no loading issue from 6am to 7.30am when crossovers are in place. In fact, most of the complaints I heard are no buses arriving between 7.48am to 8am or 7.50am to 8.10am when some of the crossover left and there are shortage of buses or buses unable keep on their schedule.</p>
              <p>Sir, I believe he had received instructions to stay until 8.30. I will consider the loading after 8.30am as normal or low. Normal means a KUB can fetch all the passengers after looping at JW St 91 &amp; 92. To be frank,  I am living at the site area and I believe I am very sure of the situation.</p>

              <p>I've ever took note of Sv 241's loading. Normally I do not see high loadings after 8am en-route Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>As for the CHC members. My take esp on the Weekends? Sometimes they dun even need to deploy ADDs for them. Many of them just clogg up the lower deck refusing to move to e upper deck.</p>
              <p>Sometimes not wanna be critical, but passengers simply are e ones tat cause all these bus delays. Is it because SBS too good to provide 3 - 5 mins freq so they think always have next bus I dunno.</p>
              <p>As for 179, go take a look at the demand esp after 0745. An MRT arrival can easily fill up 2x Sv 179A ADDs. If there's any further delay, see wat happens if it moves to the new int wef next acad yr.</p>

              <p>i suggest you ask your SLBP acquiantances to put in a request citing the data &amp; observations, if there is a need to add a bus or sacrifice trips on sv179. actually, if you have heard of these complaints thru SLBP, they'd have been doing something. if not then you can forward to them.</p>

              From my observation of crowded svcs, I think some buses should be deployed to leave the interchange empty and start the journey somewhere down the route, so that other pax have better chances to board the buses.
              
              For eg, some empty svc 25 buses in morning peak can start the journey towards Bedok somewhere along AMK Ave 3? some empty svc 190 buses can start journey during peak periods towards CCK somewhere along Dhoby Ghaut, so that Orchard pax can have better chances to board?
              
              For authorities, I think LTA should look into traffic problems for instance at Somerset/Orchard Turn area, as buses going through this stretch is a nightmare! Our bus operators should highlight such problems to LTA and cooperate.

              <p>"I had heard many complaints raised during this period." You're not convincing your SLBP friends with the background of these complaints? Then you must be instructing them to do something by providing the timings. Your forwarding of complaints to them is as complaints reaching them. So don't say you're not complaining. If you think the situation is not worthy of a complaint, you're not going to recite whatever you see everyday to your friends in SLBP?</p>
              <p>How often do you see the inspectors doing site checks for sv 241?</p>

              <p>"I had heard many complaints raised during this period." You're not convincing your SLBP friends with the background of these complaints? Then you must be instructing them to do something by providing the timings. Your forwarding of complaints to them is as complaints reaching them. So don't say you're not complaining. If you think the situation is not worthy of a complaint, you're not going to recite whatever you see everyday to your friends in SLBP?</p>
              <p>How often do you see the inspectors doing site checks for sv 241?</p>

              <p>Sir, as mentioned earlier I had already feeded them with the timings. Now, I believe they are collecting the data and doing site checks.</p>
              <p>I spotted the bus inspectors on alternate days. Btw, spotted 1 green man recently too but I somehow believe he stays around JW ext.</p>

              <p>if they're willing to adjust timing just because you fed some timings without justification, then it sounds very fishy. if no complaints, just by your voice, need to do site checks?</p>
              <p>if everyone wants more buses at whatever timings they want and feed them to you, i think our poor traffic inspectors must be very busy meeting the wants of everybody.</p>
              <p>i simply don't understand the need not to acknowledge that there were complaints (as you said you have received). at least SLBP is doing something right? aren't you proud of it? or do you seek to hide the fact that there are complaints against SLBP services, when every depot has its fair share to deal with?</p>
