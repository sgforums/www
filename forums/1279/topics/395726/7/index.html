              <p>Heard from some Boon Lay Int BCs that SBST keep receiving
              complaints about service 241 almost daily. Those BCs mentioned a
              guy called David Lim living at Jurong West St 91 near City Harvest
              Church keep sending in complaint letters until 241 was brought to
              some attention.</p>
              <p>Strange to know that this fella keeps complaining. Maybe should
              find out from him the problem if happen to see him.</p>
              <p>The traffic light timings at Jurong West St 62 seriously need to
              be adjusted.</p>

              <p>the tone you have demonstrated is displeasure over people labelling you as David Lim. if you aren't him, why get so overly reactive? its clearly demonstrating to the other party that you are trying to deny your identity as "David Lim" as what they have accused you to be. if you aren't him, ignore them and carry on with whats more important. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
