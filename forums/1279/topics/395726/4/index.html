              <p><br>There seems to be a pattern in the heartlands that are far from the city centre. the 8pm+ trips in these towns can also be packed with people. This actually goes in line with where most people who travel by public transport work.</p>
              <p>Say the big 3 in the east. Demand actually starts to drop after 8.30 or 9pm. the farther from city centre, the later it drops. Coupled with split shift keeping and meal breaks ending the frequency will drag a little after the core pm peak period.</p>
              <p>Conversely, it also means the pre-am peak load is likely to be heavy especially if pax are travelling a great distance to their workplace. That is why the Boon Lay feeder loads drop after 7.45am. This allows 242 and 243 buses to cross to 179/199 respectively for the student loads.</p>
              <p>Towns near the city centre like Clementi, Bt Merah, Toa Payoh and Serangoon are pretty tricky. By theory the loads should drop after 8pm but due to residents taking advantage of their geographical residential convenience, they may go home later from the city centre than people who stay farther away. In the end, demand may only drop at the same time as the towns farther away from city centre.</p>
              <p>I agree that frequency tends to get screwed after the QoS 10min freq especially for PM peak (AM peak not so jia lat). The problem lies here is the pm shift mealbreaks cannot be too early (cos they start like 1.5-2hours then meal break), and neither it can be too late (split shift keep liao means with mealbreak = longer headway). Either way still screwed that's why they stick to the current way.</p>
              <p>Extending the QoS 10min freq period isnt financially viable either, depending on service. Maybe they can consider 12min for the 30-45min period after the 10min pm peak-within-peak period. Services from the city centre may sound good as compared to services serving the heartlands. The impact on the points i raised in the earlier para wont be so much, and yet still able to satisfy a group of commuters who happen to take during this period. But of course having 12min post peak-within-peak period may also lead to even longer headways after that period. Its hard to balance.</p>

              <p>The QoS 10 mins time belt is quite hindering PM peak operations.</p>
              <p>Actually should leave it to PTOs to decide over the 10 mins for PM peak, it could be replaced w/ 12 mins freq but w/ ADDs deployed. But it's not going to be possible in the short term.</p>

              <p>12-minute headway over a 2-hour period (11 trips inclusive) seems to be a better solution for the greater good. currently most services have to cope with close to 15-minute headway within the 2-hour peak (11 trips inclusive also) just to "spam" trips for that 1-hour period.</p>
              <p><strong>Current scenario:<br></strong>1700 1710 1720 1730 1740 1750 1800 1815 1830 1845 1900</p>

              <p>As for Sv 969.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents thought is to intro a Sv 969A. It would end at Yishun
                  Ave 5 and off service back to Tampines via Upp Thomson Rd, SLE,
                  TPE.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>The statistics for people travelling from TPE into Lentor Avenue shows that for Services 858 (old route) and 969 combined, while half of all passengers onboard alight at Yishun MRT, approximately the same number of people will board the buses to head into Woodlands. In fact, passenger flow is steady all the way to first stop of Woodlands New Town, and there is no drastic drop in passengers after the proposed end-point of the SWT. So there is no basis to do the off service manuerve.</p>

              <p>Agreed. For instance, 962 with full fleet bendies back then running at around 12 to 15 minutes provided a just nice capacity. But having bendies coming every 10 minutes would be an overkill, which is why they had to be substituted with rigids. But as a result, you get sardine-packed rigids. Which is why some bendies remain, alternating between the rigids.</p>

              <p>179 and 241 damn nice to take during PM peak.... so many buses. <br><br>But funnily, I realise a trend. <br><br>241 comes at about 8 minutes frequency, and a 241 SD always comes 1 minute before the 241 DD, causing the 241 SD to be filled with standing passengers, and the 241 DD to be only filled with about 10 commuters.</p>
