              <p>if they're willing to adjust timing just because you fed some timings without justification, then it sounds very fishy. if no complaints, just by your voice, need to do site checks?</p>
              <p>if everyone wants more buses at whatever timings they want and feed them to you, i think our poor traffic inspectors must be very busy meeting the wants of everybody.</p>
              <p>i simply don't understand the need not to acknowledge that there were complaints (as you said you have received). at least SLBP is doing something right? aren't you proud of it? or do you seek to hide the fact that there are complaints against SLBP services, when every depot has its fair share to deal with?</p>

              <p><br>Eh, I think I didn't explain myself clearly. I heard that there was complain for this service and I had also seen the bus inspector running checks at the bus stop. Me myself had also got some feedback from my friends staying around this area.</p>
              <p>Of course SLBP is doing something right. They should be rewarded for doing this fast. :)</p>
