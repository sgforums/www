              <p>To meet the QoS, the bendies were replaced with rigids running at a better frequency, even though the changes may be marginal. Service 912 is another good example.</p>
              <p>And because QoS doesnt really affect much of weekend operations, the perm bendies like 1233X and 1234T return to 962 only on those two days lol.</p>
