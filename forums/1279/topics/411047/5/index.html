              <p>First of all, i would like to say that each individual or more specifically, each bus enthusiast is entitled to render support to either one of the two transport giants, or even both SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>
              <p>It's not a matter of of who copies who. If you say SMRT copies SBS Transit, i can also say SBS Transit copies SMRT because they bought the Citaro also. So, does that mean they have no standard? It's as similar i'm saying i bought IPhone 4 and another person buys it. Can i also say that person have no standard because he copied me by buying the phone?</p>
              <p>MAN bus isn't exclusive only to SBS Transit. Similarly, as much as Tibs and now SMRT Buses prefered choice of bus brand is Mercedes Benz, it is not exclusive to SMRT Buses only. Why do i say that? If it is exclusive to SMRT Buses only, SBS Transit would not be able to purchase 300 Citaros.</p>
              <p>Whether it's SMRT Buses or SBS Transit, each company is entitled to any type of bus available on the market, to suit their operating needs. It is very obvious SBS Transit replaces their fleet by the hundreds and not in smaller portions, because after all, they operate close to 3000 buses and maintains a 75% share of the local bus transport in Singapore. SMRT Buses operates close to a fleet of 900 buses. You can't expect SMRT Buses to simply buy buses by the hundreds just because SBS Transit is doing it? It's not like child's play here. I buy 300, they also buy 300. No, it dosen't work that way.</p>
              <p>It's all about economical sense. When SBS Transit or SMRT Buses makes a purchase for new buses, i am sure they think long term. In terms of maintenance, spare parts. They can't simply buy this particular bus just because it's nice and the brand is well known. A lot of research has to be done to justify a large purchase.</p>
              <p>From my opinion, each company has its own sets of demerits. Just like a human being, nobody's perfect. Nothing in this world is perfect. No system, no machine. There are bound to be flaws. I don't believe they have ruined the current DAF, Scania and even Dennis. I admit, their buses may not be the best or even in the optimal operating conditions, but at least they're trying to make it better by refurbishing the interior. For God's sake, the old Tibs interior just dosen't fit anymore in this day and age we live in. Besides, if they didn't refurbish the Scanias and DAFs, they would be in a much worse condition right now. At least, the refurbished Scanias and DAFs are much more pleasant to ride on than a non refurbished one.</p>
              <p>Once again, i would like to stress out that i'm not saying SMRT Buses is perfect, but at least they're trying to make changes for the better. So, don't simply anyhow shoot negative remarks about someone or an organization just because you hate it to the core. Justify your remarks with evidence. Yes, in the past, people thought that SMRT Buses lacks the enthusiasm and courage to run a bus company. But, that has changed. I wouldn't say totally change, but give them a chance to prove themselves worthy</p>
              <p>It's just like a guy who has just been released from prison. Don't entirely condemn that person just because he served time in prison and has a criminal record. It's all about giving chances and having faith.</p>
              <p>Both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses have their good points and bad points.</p>
              <p>On an ending note, i believe SMRT Buses MAN bus will be different from SBS Transit's one. I looked through the MAN brochure and i have to say they have quite a number of chassis for bus operators to choose from. I suspect, however, that SMRT Buses chose the low floor version, similar to the Citaro.</p>

              <p>First of all, i would like to say that each individual or more specifically, each bus enthusiast is entitled to render support to either one of the two transport giants, or even both SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>
              <p>It's not a matter of of who copies who. If you say SMRT copies SBS Transit, i can also say SBS Transit copies SMRT because they bought the Citaro also. So, does that mean they have no standard? It's as similar i'm saying i bought IPhone 4 and another person buys it. Can i also say that person have no standard because he copied me by buying the phone?</p>
              <p>MAN bus isn't exclusive only to SBS Transit. Similarly, as much as Tibs and now SMRT Buses prefered choice of bus brand is Mercedes Benz, it is not exclusive to SMRT Buses only. Why do i say that? If it is exclusive to SMRT Buses only, SBS Transit would not be able to purchase 300 Citaros.</p>
              <p>Whether it's SMRT Buses or SBS Transit, each company is entitled to any type of bus available on the market, to suit their operating needs. It is very obvious SBS Transit replaces their fleet by the hundreds and not in smaller portions, because after all, they operate close to 3000 buses and maintains a 75% share of the local bus transport in Singapore. SMRT Buses operates close to a fleet of 900 buses. You can't expect SMRT Buses to simply buy buses by the hundreds just because SBS Transit is doing it? It's not like child's play here. I buy 300, they also buy 300. No, it dosen't work that way.</p>
              <p>It's all about economical sense. When SBS Transit or SMRT Buses makes a purchase for new buses, i am sure they think long term. In terms of maintenance, spare parts. They can't simply buy this particular bus just because it's nice and the brand is well known. A lot of research has to be done to justify a large purchase.</p>
              <p>From my opinion, each company has its own sets of demerits. Just like a human being, nobody's perfect. Nothing in this world is perfect. No system, no machine. There are bound to be flaws. I don't believe they have ruined the current DAF, Scania and even Dennis. I admit, their buses may not be the best or even in the optimal operating conditions, but at least they're trying to make it better by refurbishing the interior. For God's sake, the old Tibs interior just dosen't fit anymore in this day and age we live in. Besides, if they didn't refurbish the Scanias and DAFs, they would be in a much worse condition right now. At least, the refurbished Scanias and DAFs are much more pleasant to ride on than a non refurbished one.</p>
              <p>Once again, i would like to stress out that i'm not saying SMRT Buses is perfect, but at least they're trying to make changes for the better. So, don't simply anyhow shoot negative remarks about someone or an organization just because you hate it to the core. Justify your remarks with evidence. Yes, in the past, people thought that SMRT Buses lacks the enthusiasm and courage to run a bus company. But, that has changed. I wouldn't say totally change, but give them a chance to prove themselves worthy</p>
              <p>It's just like a guy who has just been released from prison. Don't entirely condemn that person just because he served time in prison and has a criminal record. It's all about giving chances and having faith.</p>
              <p>Both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses have their good points and bad points.</p>
              <p>On an ending note, i believe SMRT Buses MAN bus will be different from SBS Transit's one. I looked through the MAN brochure and i have to say they have quite a number of chassis for bus operators to choose from. I suspect, however, that SMRT Buses chose the low floor version, similar to the Citaro.</p>

              <p><br>Let me challenge your view points and put your attempts at objectivity in perspective.</p>
              <p>No comments about "entitlement to purchase whither". BUT. Why did TIBS choose so many types and so little quantity in each? Diversification? But as we can see its giving SMRT a nightmare with mainteinance. We see frankenstein buses because there's so many types of spare parts and so little in eac type at the same time. Why the "nice" (yes, I admit I do actually like the seats) seats when they prove to be SMRT's bugbear when they collected dust and what-not later? Maybe it can be conjectured that TIBS took a lot of pride in their buses, but I would say its been rather short-sighted moves on its part. You would be very wrong to insinuate that the bus companies are DEFINITELY rational in their planning, because nobody is perfectly rational. In fact, think about this: what in the world is "being rational" in the first place? Chew on that.</p>
              <p>I don't need SMRT to refurbish the buses to make me happy. Just for god's sake clean the freaking buses and remind the technicians to STOP laying their greasy hands on the interior and not wiping them after they are done! I can recognise these traits because I used to do such dirty work also, and if I left any of my mark, I would have been screwed up down left right down centre.</p>
              <p>SBST has 3000, SMRT has 900. SBST has purchased 1500 new buses (1/2), SMRT has purchased around 200 (2/9). The figures speak for themselves. SMRT has plenty of 90s era buses to replace as well. You were right in using proportions, but wrong when you failed to put the numbers in.</p>
              <p>They did not "ruin" the Scanias? Well, in truth, the "ruin" part is contentious, but dare you deny that the N113s were in better condition than the L113s despite and relative to the significant age gap?</p>
              <p>Justify my viewpoints with evidence? Well, let's debate shall we?</p>
              <p>And of course, all these were typed with due respect...in case anybody gets the wrong ideas.</p>

              <p>kuang, I do agree with you with certain points. But for your refurnishment part, their efforts are more of the reactive aspect rather than the proactive aspect.

              <p>On the other hand, SBST did their refurnishments long before when the buses just reaching their mid lifespans. The old WA air con ducts are dirty because of the felt material used and the old DM ducts are small and dirty because they are lighter in color. Thus they refurnish all the buses before more complaints came in, though I missed the old grey leather and blue felt seats. Now they are still as new as ever.</p>
              <p>Just look at the differences in treating their own fleets. They are good at giving tons of excuses, but never proactive in improving standards. You may think that the mangement might have improved, however, if the company as a whole is not supportive of the division, then what is the point? Might as well divert the resources to their core and let someone else take over their job to provide a better service.</p>

              <p>Fellow forumer, I dont deny that SBST has purchased 1500 new buses and SMRT has purchased 200. But let me ask you a question. How many buses has its lifespan expired and thus need to be scrapped were from SBST? Scania N113s (200), B10M Mark 2s (200), o405 (Total 600, left how many?), Leylands (to leave soon). This 1500 are to replace some of that and increase the fleet size to meet demands.</p>
              <p>You might want to compare that to SMRT. Just a couple of L113 whos chassis is uneconomical to repair anymore, and some of the UD. 200 buses bought for fleet expansion.</p>
              <p>I dont think its fair for you to compare how many new buses have been purchased and take that as a benchmark of how good the company is. Account need to be taken into considering how much % of the fleet they had to replace because of its lifespan expiry.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, SMRT's o405 are also going expiry in the near future, this is probably the reason why multiple bus manufacturers are starting to loan demonstrators to SMRT for trial. I believe its important to be aware that demonstrators are usually not <strong>requested</strong> from the bus operator. They are <strong>given/loaned</strong> to the bus operator for trial purposes to demonstrate the ability of the said vehicle, and therefore increase the chances that the bus operator will purchase some amount if it shows good performance.</p>
              <p>Simpily said, Mercedes Benz/MAN/Zhongtong are trying to coax SMRT to buy vehicles for fleet replacement of the o405s.</p>

              <p>I would just say wrong timing for LTA to force mandatory WAB
                      fleet too early and wrong timing for SGD to appreciate against
                      pound/Euro. Else we might have 1101 Mercedes Benz Citaros
                      instead.</p>
              <p>Price for KUB is right, pressure from LTA and commuters, so what
                      can be the final decision? You decide.</p>
              <p>Maybe the EURO 4s will pharsed out earlier than you know, who
                      knows?</p>

              <p>I believe wrong timing is very subjective there. Accessibility has long been a factor of how well developed is the country. Had it not been LTA who pushed for it, i believe both of the bus operator will not install wheelchair ramps. Look at the VSO, they had the capability of having wheelchair ramps installed, yet SBST did not take the initiative to do so.</p>
              <p>If a comparison is made between hk and sg in terms of accessibility, we are years behind. the first batch of Tridents came with ramps, and that was in 1997. Until 2006 or 2007 after lifts were installed in mrt stations and with the arrival of the K230s, the only way for a Wheelchair bound person to travel was simply to book a london cab.</p>

              <p>I know you never say that SBS Transit are damn good....but they aren't better in service standards and bus maintenance also. And fyi, I am also not saying SMRT good just because I like SMRT. From what you have typed out, it sounds that you are saying SBS Transit so good blabla....but do you think before you talk good about them? </p>
              <p>Lets take an example...6 buses burned at AMDEP...did SBS Transit bother to bring them back? Or at least 1 bus? Question yourself before you comment bad about others...</p>

              <p>Well, at least I don't have to bear with insect infested buses, dirty and dusty interiors and forever unknown frequncies and packed buses. And some of their old buses are falling apart. Apart from SBST, even the old SBS and TIBS is a notch better than SMRTB.</p>
              <p>You want to pay the cost of bringing them back? Then why don't you pay? Money is not that easy to earn nowadays, do you know? </p>
              <p>The buses that are affected are all older buses and most of them are the Leyland Olympians are admist of being pharsing out by next year. So why spend extra money to rebuild them when new buses are coming to replace? You think rebuilding buses is very cheap is it? Like buying a plate of noodles? The B10TL demo has been replaced by the K310UD demo, fortunately or unfortunately. From the looks of it, it's beyond repair. The only unlucky bus I think will be the B9TL. However if that bus was burnt beyond repair, then might as well get a new bus. I am not going to talk about depot, in case this might invoke a depot flame war again between SLBP, and AMKD.</p>
              <p>They have brought in 150 Wright B9TLs to replace the older double deckers. They have more to come and they have enough buses to cover without affecting much of their operations. The glitch I have with them is that they need more double deckers.</p>

              <p>Well, I meant by to early is that the timings to meet the quota is too rushed, within such short span of years. If LTA is really sincere about providing mobility to Wheelchair bound commuters, they should have done it in the early years from the 2000 till now for a gradual change. This allows them to upgrade the bus stop to be PIW accessible while bus companies gradually can change their fleet to be WAB accessible.</p>
              <p>However the situation now is that, so many buses are WAB ready, yet only half or less bus stops here are WAB freiandly. If LTA can't upgrade all the bus stops within the short span of time and allow PIWs to board all WAB buses, why bother to push the quota of bus fleets to meet WAB status so fast?</p>
              <p>In the end, what we get? One bus co. trying to meet quota mass purchase a standardised model, while the other couldn't be bothered because of economies of scale.</p>
              <p>I can only say LTA screws up our bus operations more and more over the years. We can't even match the standards of Hong Kong buses, yet want to claim world class.</p>
