              <p>You are not even part of the arguement, who are you to come in and argue? I was trying to tell someone that his comment in the SBST Citaro thread is wrong because one day one bus company will look into other brands. And I don't agree that SBST can only buy double deckers and SMRT can only buy articulated buses and vice versa. Bus operators in Hong Kong don't behave that way.</p>
              <p>Go read up the history. If you want to argue, SMRT forever copy others, SBS/SBST and TIBS, because SBS is the first one, after Singapore proper bus organisation in the 1970s, to buy Mercedes Benz buses. As for China buses, I don't really care about them. Best is that SBST don't buy any. You don't want them to copy, ok. SMRT go buy China buses only and SBST only buy European buses. Happy?</p>

              <p>First of all, i would like to say that each individual or more specifically, each bus enthusiast is entitled to render support to either one of the two transport giants, or even both SBS Transit and SMRT.</p>
              <p>It's not a matter of of who copies who. If you say SMRT copies SBS Transit, i can also say SBS Transit copies SMRT because they bought the Citaro also. So, does that mean they have no standard? It's as similar i'm saying i bought IPhone 4 and another person buys it. Can i also say that person have no standard because he copied me by buying the phone?</p>
              <p>MAN bus isn't exclusive only to SBS Transit. Similarly, as much as Tibs and now SMRT Buses prefered choice of bus brand is Mercedes Benz, it is not exclusive to SMRT Buses only. Why do i say that? If it is exclusive to SMRT Buses only, SBS Transit would not be able to purchase 300 Citaros.</p>
              <p>Whether it's SMRT Buses or SBS Transit, each company is entitled to any type of bus available on the market, to suit their operating needs. It is very obvious SBS Transit replaces their fleet by the hundreds and not in smaller portions, because after all, they operate close to 3000 buses and maintains a 75% share of the local bus transport in Singapore. SMRT Buses operates close to a fleet of 900 buses. You can't expect SMRT Buses to simply buy buses by the hundreds just because SBS Transit is doing it? It's not like child's play here. I buy 300, they also buy 300. No, it dosen't work that way.</p>
              <p>It's all about economical sense. When SBS Transit or SMRT Buses makes a purchase for new buses, i am sure they think long term. In terms of maintenance, spare parts. They can't simply buy this particular bus just because it's nice and the brand is well known. A lot of research has to be done to justify a large purchase.</p>
              <p>From my opinion, each company has its own sets of demerits. Just like a human being, nobody's perfect. Nothing in this world is perfect. No system, no machine. There are bound to be flaws. I don't believe they have ruined the current DAF, Scania and even Dennis. I admit, their buses may not be the best or even in the optimal operating conditions, but at least they're trying to make it better by refurbishing the interior. For God's sake, the old Tibs interior just dosen't fit anymore in this day and age we live in. Besides, if they didn't refurbish the Scanias and DAFs, they would be in a much worse condition right now. At least, the refurbished Scanias and DAFs are much more pleasant to ride on than a non refurbished one.</p>
              <p>Once again, i would like to stress out that i'm not saying SMRT Buses is perfect, but at least they're trying to make changes for the better. So, don't simply anyhow shoot negative remarks about someone or an organization just because you hate it to the core. Justify your remarks with evidence. Yes, in the past, people thought that SMRT Buses lacks the enthusiasm and courage to run a bus company. But, that has changed. I wouldn't say totally change, but give them a chance to prove themselves worthy</p>
              <p>It's just like a guy who has just been released from prison. Don't entirely condemn that person just because he served time in prison and has a criminal record. It's all about giving chances and having faith.</p>
              <p>Both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses have their good points and bad points.</p>
              <p>On an ending note, i believe SMRT Buses MAN bus will be different from SBS Transit's one. I looked through the MAN brochure and i have to say they have quite a number of chassis for bus operators to choose from. I suspect, however, that SMRT Buses chose the low floor version, similar to the Citaro.</p>

              <p>Firstly, SMRT buses's infrastructure is still not double decker ready yet, this means simply they are not ready to accept any deckers until it is. You need depots to have infrastructure to be able to accept their height, and also washing equipment.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you do keep up with bus news not just within singapore, STA which operates a fleet of b12ble volvo single decks do not really like its fuel consumption. Also, the other viable model of volvo is the b7rle, which you can see sbst went against it and bought citaros instead.</p>

              <p>Well, Volvo AU just won a contract to supply buses to TransPerth, and the B12BLEA and B7RLE are among those chosen. The contract with Mercedes is running out but was not renewed. Looks like the Volvos will replace the Renaults wholesale. I'm getting bored of the OC500s and O405NHs right now, and the Volvos will be a refreshing sight.</p>

              <p>That's also the point. If u look at the order, the single deck rigids are either B7RLE or B9RLE(future) with cng. B12BLE is not inside the picture except that they had to replace bendies with b12blea.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't comment on the b7rle performance etc, but there has to be a reason why sbst did not keep it, and instead opt for citaro as i mention earlier. Probably the same reason why smrt did not look for volvo single deck too.</p>

                                      operated by French VEOLIA in Morocco with the competition over

                                      Scania, Zhongtong Bus has gained many orders for new energy buses
                                      and chassis from many countries and regions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this August, the company will deliver 30 hybrid power buses
                                      to the customers in Singapore; sign the order of 300 electric buses
                                      with customers from Taiwan and the one of over 600 chassis from
                                      Saudi Arabia, Iran. Based on related data, it possibly obtains the
