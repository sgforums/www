These design looks old! They should at least be designed in a way that it looks like a bus in 1990s. With its current shape , its design of the body looks no difference with the 1980s SCN &amp; U31F. Take a look at the Dafs buses in CSS , they were introduced in 1992 , even older than the RCN &amp; it has a more good looking design. So i just dont undderstand why a bus newer than these 1992 Dafs has an oldest design , shame on the designer of these RCNs to be launched in 1993. Even te older Mk2s in SBST were more gd looking.</div></blockquote>The reason is very simple. TIBS had always believed in CBU (Completely Built Up) buses. Hence, the Nissans are CBU in Japan and then sent to Singapore. This explains why the buses are of Japanese configuration.<br><br>Besides, I believe back then, besides Japan, no other body manufacturers have body kits that fits a Japanese configured city bus. You all should know Japan is very self sufficient, especially in terms of IT.</div>

I think the SBST Striders' interior look better than the SMRT ones. SBST ones seem "cooler" and "sleeker" with the darker panel colours, compared to SMRT's green panels which vibrate non-stop when the bus is not moving. Moreover, for the SMRT Striders, the air-con filter on the green panel is very dirty or sometimes, not even present, letting you see what's inside...<br><br>SBST Striders with the yellow seats look way better, both internally and externally. I like the single headlight, compared to SMRT's "martian" headlights with the ugly fake grille (which have dropped off on some) between the headlights... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
