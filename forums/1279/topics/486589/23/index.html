              <p>Anyway since you stay in jurong west as I recognized by your nickname jurongwestresident, do you go to cck lot 1 shopping today? If yes, can help lookout for it today? Maybe cck posters may also have been released which I am not too sure. Do you have any CCK friends who may have known about new services released? Anyway jurong west and CCK are quite close. Both are in west region. Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Acx1688, yes everybody wants that. It may happen this time round for cck. So sad punggol only has a feeder service and we all thought it is a new trunk service. Initially it was said to be a new service in the press release few weeks earlier. But it turns out to be just a feeder. Now worse. Not new feeder. Just a route extension. Hahaha </p>

              <p>I took sv 324 three times during peak full route. Most trips bus has only 15 pax. Total waste of resource. It would have been better if it was a short trunk plying Upper Serangoon, and connecting Buangkok Dr and looping @ Buangkok MRT or serving further to Sengkang west town. </p>

              <p>386 would not be making losses in the beginning by putting 1 bus
              with 2 BCs, jump bus ops, save money and petrol and space. Present
              386 can make do by driving slightly faster like how 11 handled full
              day(nt including breaks) w a bus, distance is slightly longer than
              386.</p>
              <p>As all know, 386 was introduced to make up the numbers to make
              Punggol look good with new service intro when it runs parallel to
              LRT, 3,50,83,85</p>
              <p>Same w 324, 3 buses! Look at loading figures... </p>
              <p>Same w 63M, always cluster w 63...</p>
              <p>Anyone with other SHORT M services details, please share...(LTA
              ones, not SBST's 70M,162M,etc)</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have the same issue with some of these M services and have said it before as well. 63M - put way too many buses. Even 63M buses bunch together.</p>
              <p>143M - does well on its own if 143 or 79 has not called stop. If they do, 143M goes completely empty. If 143M gets full, the next bus 79 or 143 coming in couple of minutes goes empty. Remember when I say 79 goes empty it is AM peak from Penjuru to JE (not other way round, or ill get flamed :P)</p>
              <p>43M - I support this one. It was needed with the huge surge in flats along Buangkok and high occupancy. 43/70 not able to manage loads. This is a good move. Though it should have been Buangkok MRT to Serangoon IMO (coz b/w BGK and PGL almost go empty)</p>
              <p>139M - This move is also okay coz 139 many times does get late and it is the only service catering along Whompoa north. Plus haven't spammed too many buses.</p>
              <p>131M - okay. just substitute for 275. Good move coz 275 on most trips like 324 would not get more than 15-20 pax, especially if 131 called Bukit Purmei before, would go totally empty. </p>
              <p>So for me: bad is 143M, okay is 63M (reduce 2 buses), 139M and good is 43M, 131M</p>

              <p>The current route 386 is only 3.6km. I took that route before,
              on a Saturday at around 12pm. The bus was quite empty, with only
              around four people (me, the bus driver and two other
              people). </p>
              <p>Extending the route will certainly increase the loading on 386.
              However, from the way the route is being extended, it seems that
              386 is an intra-town service - rather than a feeder service - for
              the extended catchment, because the LRT obviously provides a
              shorter connection to the MRT.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I highly doubt the loading will increase much. Punggol plaza, Punggol east, Oasis have direct LRT to Punggol MRT. Punggol Central residents naturally will prefer 83/85/3 to the long winding 386.</p>
              <p>It will benefit Waterway residents who want to go to Punggol Plaza for amenities. Overall route I think loading will continue to be around 10-15 pax (not more). Will check after a month and report my loading observation during peak hour. </p>

              <p>I think it is because CCK buses still had to be sorted out. Now that 972 has gone full fleet DD and 67 will get DDs, KJDEP will have some SP MANA22s to deploy on new service. Plus they were waiting for BSEP B3 MANA22 registration IMO. So we should see it coming up soon.</p>
