              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the way I see it, the current route is still
              fine. No need to start from serangoon int as the int is packed.
              Cannot add another service or else sbs 81 and sbs 82 will not have
              to be amended in yr 2010. Sbs 81 will not need to loop at serangoon
              central and sbs 82 will not have to change starting int from
              serangoon to Punggol.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At times where sbs 116 loading
              is poor, it's frequency is neither great too. Not all bus services
              need to assume full loading at all sectors of the route. There are
              always higher crowds at certain sectors to compensate for the lower
              loading for other sectors. If it is that bad until it is
              unsustainable, LTA will have amended its route after receiving so
              much feedback over the 2 years. The fact that the route still
              remains shows that it may not be too bad as mentioned.
              Cheers. </span></p>

              <p>Ha ha ha ha... "The fact that the route still remains..." sorry... this statement makes me laugh... which service LTA has modified... even if service is redundant, LTA will keep it... has so much money... has to spend it somewhere.</p>
              <p>Anyway, sv 116 I have observed very closely... taken it 10 times+ almost full route... observed it 20+ times at NEX for loading (and 20+ times means days)... if u catch number of buses observed, will be around 60-70 buses on 116. I have also observed similarly at HG Interchange.</p>
              <p>By now you should know I stay around NEL... so with my passion of loading analysis... I have observed this route very closely... and that's why I complain about it... I don't do it on other services... coz their loading is respectable... IMO even 120 is better than 116. </p>
              <p>But yes LTA will keep this service... coz as I mentioned they 1. will not like to show that they made a mistake in route planning and 2. they don't care, coz they have excess funds. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, they have already made known that they will not hesitate to amend BSEP routes or withdrawn it if the demand is too poor. They will make changes to the routes if there is constructive feedback. They have also amended sbs 49 in response to feedback from residents. Even if the bus service is BSEP, they will do it. This is made known already. By right, if a road is in Hougang, the Hougang int must have a bus service to ply it. Not a service from other interchanges (tampines) to serve it only. Something is amiss if sbs 72 plus the route only without any service from Hougang. Anyway sufficient home work must be done when service is introduced. Even after sbs 116 is introduced, sbs 72 route is still very high in demand. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I was trying to put in a nice way that sbs 49 was amended due to feedback. So It is a point to rebut you that you laughed at the statement the route still remains. So I did not miss your point. I merely try to make you look good. If a route is that lousy, surely it will have been amended after so many people feedback. When the route still remain, this will indicate that it proves that it has achieved a minimum standard of a service that LTA introduced initially. If LTA sets too low a bar as a minimum standard, write in and comment. See what they reply. So please do not launch words and comment like 'it is always the same way with you'. You sound so overbearing and self assuming and this reflects poorly of you as a person. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB1112, I prefer bus services from Punggol going to other locations in singapore rather than always the same old few places (sengkang, Hougang, serangoon). Give us somewhere like orchard or novena or balestier. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I do not like to get into a war of words. This is my style and has always been. I don't teach people and I don't expect any credits. Everybody who reads all these knows who always starts off all these nonsense and who likes to shoot people. You are one who is boastful and brings down people by your comments. Only knows how to criticize the authority when you don't get it your way. You have shot me few times while I still remain passive and do not bother to get into all these rubbish. Show your knowledge without being disrespectful to others. Keep on shooting me and show to others your naivety. This is not the first time. If admins here can ban people who always shoots people, you will definitely be one of them. I rest my case. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, why not? Do something constructive. Write in. If fail, write to your RC or even the MP if you think lobbying helps. At least if he or she cannot help, then at least you know you have done something. Better than lament here and there or in forums online lambasting the authority. Sbs 49 route was amended due to feedback to the RC and MP. Cheers.</p>
