                              <p>IMO, no need so complicated.</p>
              <p>Just have at 27M from hougang central and loop at tampines
              central with the exact 27 route. This route can use majority DD
              fleet.</p>
              <p>I was thinking service 27 could just skip tampines and go to
              airport straight. but this might cause unhappiness amongst tampines
              residents who will lose a direct airport connection, even though
              most people could walk abit further to take 34. Depending on
              whether lta is willing to do that, 27 can be ammended to be airport
              direct from sengkang or stay as it is. There is no necessity to
              make 27 a direct airport access for sengkang/hougang residents
              because those who wish to go to the airport faster can transfer to
              858. But 858 frequency should increase to accommodate more people
              who are willing to do the transfer (the bus is mostly full when it
              reaches sengkang alr)</p>

              I think you are just crazy, you expect those aunty uncle to walk ave 9 to ave 5. you miss out those people who are going to Sengkang from Tampines MRT station. You know how heavy is the loading like??? Who will want to walk from Ave 4 to Ave 5???
              
              
              27 is a xcellent service or (Burger Service)

                              <p>Sv 34 has a more extensive coverage of Tampines area than Sv
              27.<br>
              <br>
              I noticed that if 27 were to go directly to CGA from Sengkang:</p>
              <p>Residents boarding Sv 27 along Tampines Ave 9 can walk the other
              side to Tampines Ave 5 to board Sv 34. Current HDB blocks in that
              area are sandwiched between Ave 5 and Ave 9.<br>
              <br>
              For Tampines Central itself, People boarding Sv. 27 along Tampine
              Ave 4 can walk the other side to catch Sv. 34 from Tampines ave
              5. <br>
              <br>
              The other sectors of Tampines are only served by Sv 34 only
              anyway.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I am wrong. Its just a suggestion. But a 27/27M
              solution is what I would suggest. The 27/47 suggestion I said is of
              course more drastic.</p>
              <p>For Service 858, I do agree of the high loadings to airport from
              northern Singapore but as a resident in Sengkang, I still choose to
              take 858 from TPE instead of taking 27 through tampines even if I
              have to squeeze (but I know this will not be everybody's
              preference). If frequency is increased, maybe it could help reduce
              crowds when the bus arrives at Sengkang? Its a pity that 858 cannot
              use high capacity buses really. I always hoped CGA would do
              something to make the PTB turns wider so that a bendy could pass
              through but it has never happened. DDs wise, I guess thats more far
              fetched because the height restrictions will be far harder to
              modify</p>

              <p>Meahwhile, there are still people from Changi Airport taking sv
              36 to Orchard Rd via Tomlinson Rd. Last time I took sv 36A from
              Changi Airport late at night, and some people asked BC
              did this service go to Orchard Rd. They were disappointed when they
              were told that 36A terminates at Tomlinson Rd.</p>

              <p>You are right 36 and 48 cannot use DDs due to Tanjong Katong Road south. The trees are heritage trees with huge branches and I do not wish they be chopped.</p>
              <p>But there is a work around. Instead of 36M/48 turning left onto Tanjong Katong South, they can go straight via Mountbatten and turn left on Fort road and join ECP. This sector should be <strong>express</strong> and hence, travel time will not be significantly increased. Also, mountbatten/fort road have no traffic even in peak hours, so this detour will not cause major travel time increase but commuters can be benefited with DDs. </p>
              <p>Seriously both 36/48 have heavy loads during AM/PM peak and need high capacity buses. </p>

              <p>Since the opening of MCE, the entrance at Fort Rd that was originally for ECP(City) is now only for MCE. To go to ECP(City), you need to use East Coast Park Service Rd and enter at another entrance along this road. I'm not sure if East Coast Park Service Rd is DD-friendly.</p>
