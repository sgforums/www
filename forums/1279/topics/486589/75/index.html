              <p><br>Which is a very good reason why they shouldn't only rely on that tiny little bus stop for boarding.</p>
              <p>If anything, I may think it would be better to have boarding at the bus stop after MRT Exit A2 (the bus stop that is currently used for alighting). The linkway between MRT and LRT (street level) can have some temporary queue lines for 920, 922, 979 and 983 (and maybe 975 also depends on its loading). Alighting can be done at the bus stop outside MRT (where the other bus services are stopping). There may be some confusion but at least better than the current situation.</p>

              <p>Then again, the bus stop at 44021 (exit B) can be better utilized ...</p>
              <p>I am still pondering my old suggestion of extending 177 to Yew Tee (or in this case, merge 177 and 979). Perhaps LTA can conduct trails to start 979 from 44021 during weekend PM peak to see if this could balance the load. Then start shuttles from Bt Batok to run express, and convert it to full-time if it works out. After all, most passengers on 979 transfer from the DTL and will be inconvenienced by the transfer linkway to the BPLRT.</p>
              <p>If SMRT can manage 979 well (overall, less the bus stop crowding problem), they can take over the combined service; if not, give to TT. The current MINDEF peak-hour shuttle will still be run by TT.</p>
              <p>Just a random thought. It still depends on the situation at 44851 (Petir Rd) from January onwards.</p>

              <p>To be exact, even if livery needs to be changed, but I doubted that the management or even passengers (except for us bus enthusiasts) would be obsessed with regos though...as you can see, SG-regoes are used directly on SBS Transit bus services. Even in previous cases, not all CSS buses are re-registered as TIB plates when they are transferred to TIBS during the 2000s and those TIB plates don't even get re-registered as SMB plates once they get rebranded as SMRT (although there are a few factors that are different between these two cases)...</p>

              <p>There was an increase in QOS Standards as part of BSEP which requires the scheduled headway of feeder buses to be improved then. This was one year back I think, there was a press release but LTA's website is currently down.</p>

              <p>Hi mr proudtobeme, need to call G/W due to clockwise (Punggol field side) and counter-clockwise (sentul crescent side) direction. Note Safra Punggol is at sentul crescent. It is opening in April 2016. </p>
              <p>Why need G/W? Purpose of feeder service is to get to the required destination as soon as possible. Not through a big loop then reach which is time wasting. So both directions require priority. 1. Punggol field (west side) are the first 2 stops on 382G. There are numerous flats there. 2. Sentul crescent (safra) is the 2nd stop on 382W. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>@ptbm - It's historical. They could change to 382A/B but guess they will just keep it this way as other feeders carry G/W.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, mr proudtobeme is asking why needs G/W for sbs 382 when he thinks one direction should be enough and one direction can save number of buses. You misinterpret. Feel free to read again.</p>
              <p>My 2nd paragraph above reply gives him what is needed. Here I repeat. Need both directions because Punggol field (west side) residents need fast service to interchange as they are on 1st and 2nd stops of 382G. There will be many people going to safra Punggol on 2nd stop of sbs 382W. Both directions need fast transport which is main purpose of feeder service. If only got 1 direction, some people have to travel the full loop just to get a place which should be only 1 or 2 stops. That defeats the purpose. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I think you didn't get what proudtobeme is asking... He's not asking why 382 is a bidirectional loop service (instead of looping in one single direction). He's asking why the two different directions are still called 382G and 382W (instead of something like 382A and 382B, or 382clockwise and 382anticlockwise).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, for such bidirectional loop services (e.g. 225, 243, 410), they used green and white plates to differentiate the two directions. Last time plastic destos were still common on those old buses, so by using a green desto for clockwise loop and a white desto for anti-clockwise loop, they allow commuters to know the direction it's going.</p>
              <p>When new buses with EDS kicked in, it is no longer possible to use these plastic destos. Thus, service numbers "225G" and "225W" are on display to replace the green and white destos and ultimately achieve the same outcome (in fact, even better).</p>
              <p>For 382G/W's case, proudtobeme's concern is that why do we still use "G" and "W" when there are no longer destos on 382's buses, making "green" and "white" meaningless. In this case, LTA can jolly well put the service number as "382A" and "382B", one for clockwise loop and one for anti-clockwise loop. But they still choose to use 382G and 382W, probably because of the tradition of G/W.  (Still remember the 300G/W which was never launched)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's true that proudtobeme is questioning about the abundance of buses on 382G/W, but he did not imply that buses should only run in one direction in order to save resources. Instead, he made his point very clear by saying: "still CALL g/w why? no green/white plate now?" It is just about the name of 382G/W, not the mode of operation.</p>
