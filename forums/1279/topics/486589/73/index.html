              <p>Also note 47 has only 2 DDs in its fleet of 8 buses. So I think even SBS is testing.</p>
              <p>The service that should get rid off all its DDs is 102, 119. If these can have DDs, any other service can have DD. At least 47 will have high loading b/w Tanah Merah - CBP.</p>
              <p>102, 119 today have peak loading of 45-55 pax only. Most times even lesser and for majority part of route less than 30 pax.</p>

              <p>47 will need DDs because I foresee the bus to get 80+ pax bet
              CBP and Tanah Merah, post which loading will depend on whether
              other service called or not.</p>
              <p>Also those coming in from ITE/Expo/CBP/Xilin etc and live along
              Marine Parade will prefer 47 over 31.</p>
              <p>I foresee sv 31 loading to be hit in a major way bet Marine
              Parade and Tanah Merah. </p>
              <p>In turn 47 will relieve loading on 35 (Xilin), 12 (Bedok South
              Rd), 31 (Marine Parade rd).</p>

              <p>As I have said. Introduce 47A or something, not worth for DDs to ply entire route when only a small stretch will receive crush loading.</p>
              <p>Both 12 and 31 operate at double the freq of 47. In other words, 2 12s and 31s will come before a 47. I hence don't think anyone will specifically wait for bus 47. 47 will probably receive pax who happen to have been waiting for any of the three svcs, and 47 comes first (which again will be minority given its frequency)</p>
              <p>You may wanna check out my previous post above for more of this.</p>
              <p>Given the nature of this route and its target passengers, an SD is more than sufficient to cover the TM - MP sector. I think, in fact, it will do CBP pax good with an SWT, as that would mean significantly lower turnaround times for the DDs, allowing for faster pax clearance.</p>

              <p>Bro... just 2 DDs in the fleet... let's first address the useless DDs on 102 and 119... 47 still need to evaluate and may get better loading (we have to see).</p>
              <p>For sv 31 I agree - frequency is awesome, but for 12, please note the frequency is 10-14 mins, and sometimes bus can get delayed due to super long route.</p>
              <p>All HDBs along Bedok South road take 12/38 to Tanah Merah instead of 38/229 to Bedok int due to quicker MRT access. Both 12/38 don't have good frequency, and this is my estimate of why 47 plies Bedok South road before doing MP.</p>
              <p>For MP, they have only 31 to Tanah Merah that loops around Bedok MRT, so 47 will give faster access. In future, if someone from MP sees 31 and 47 coming, they will choose latter.</p>
              <p>Having said all this, my personal opinion is we did not need a new service for MP-CBP. An existing service such as 43 could have been extended. Anyway, 43 runs quite empty b/w MP and UEC.</p>

              <p>Problem is, if I am given a choice between 31 to Bedok MRT and 47 to TM MRT I would definitely choose 31, and I'm sure many others will too. Unless if I am purposely going to TM, which will be minority again given TM's infra. </p>
              <p>Whatever the case, I am saying that whatever drmand wouldnt justify DDs. The situation you described above will only warrant SDs, there will not be a lot of pax that fall in the category above. </p>
              <p>I dont even think SBST should try. They should instead focus on getting more HC resources towards the CBP end, since it is clear SDs will be able to cope the EC sector comfortably. That is what they should try.</p>
              <p>P.s. what relevance does DDs on 119 and 102 have on the issue at hand? We all know they are redundant... But that does not make DDs on the entire 47 any more necessary!</p>

              <p>Depends. many ppl i know will take 47 (currently theyve been taking 48) from mp to tanah merah mrt and not bedok cos tm got direct connection to those like 12, 38 n 45. they take to tm and change, then take the bus for a few stops and get off. got quite a few, many of those living in simei side they think its faster than taking mrt bedok-simei and walking frm simei MRT to their hse (i tried it before and can confirm, faster). Hence sure got ppl who preferrentially take 47 to tm rather than bus to bedok. Qn is whether their number so big that need dd, and i think no.</p>

              <p>I think they are trying to see the right frequency to set for the new introduced services. Also at the same time it is the holidays for the Polytechnics after their Mid-Semestral Assessment or Common Test Week and workers are on holidays.</p>
              <p>So need to give the services some more time to adjust and also the commuters need time to adjust and have the mindset "Oh, this bus also can go here lah... Can take alr no need to wait for that other service"...</p>

              <p>Overheard a group of TP students on the bus (I think they had
              CCA activity) dicussing about the convenience of the new route as
              they lived in Sengkang and Punggol areas, it was great to hear
              that.</p>

              <p>Hi mr shellstation, not to worry. Sbs 118 is plying along roads near to areas of high potential growth. There are many ongoing HDB flats being built along Punggol west and tampines ave 8. The authorities will surely identify potential passengers load before introducing new services. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I think just nice. They already announced in my transport.sg and they have done up the queue line in Punggol interchange. Moreover, Punggol cove primary school which is a new school in sumang area opens on 4 jan 2016. Think the authorities have made it 3 jan 2016 to be in time for the new school term. </p>
              <p>Expect Punggol bus interchange and Punggol mrt to be choked full of people. Just received news that waterway point mall (northeast 2nd largest mall after NEX) will open its doors on 18 jan 2016. Finally as lively as tampines area! Cheers. Hooray!</p>

              <p>The 3 services 20,47,118 at dbs Asia hub bus stop is a good sort of promoting the new services that plies along cbp. Can see a handful of pax taking the buses out of that bus stop towards xilin.</p>
              <p>As for 47, can see many pax who take the service all taking the 47 guides while on board the bus many of which are pax from the cbp side, tm side and Bedok sth area. The number of pax on board is quite good, about 10+ as of today along these areas.</p>
              <p>The small problem that the DDs face when turning from xilin into Changi Sth ave 1 is too tight for a DD to manage, the delivery trucks were blocking the side road of that junction and one 118 bus had to do a illegal sharp L turn at the traffic light</p>
              <p>As many have mentioned at Marine parade area, the pax still prefer to board the other services first when they arrive and most are still not aware of this new service yet.</p>
              <p>Saw about 3-4 DDs on 47 today, still find it abit wasteful because of the few pax only on board. </p>

              <p>Don't want to sound boastful... but I think LTA does refer this
                  forum.. In recent past, so many of my proposed routes have come out
                  90%-100% true.</p>
              <p>382G/W - I had proposed is exactly similar <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>118 is 90% similar I would say because after Punggol West, I did
                  make it do  Punggol Field/Punggol road before touching
                  TPE <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">979 also 90% similar to what I
                  proposed, except for the fact I thought it will do Stagmont and
                  then connect CCK North 5. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>For some of the bus services, the route is very obvious; if they do not go this way, they go where?</p>
