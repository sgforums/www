              <p>I would say 811 and 812 both need it.. but they should each have got more high capacity buses from SMRT... I don't know what kind of PPSS buses will be used.. they are so below standard... that most ppl refuse to take it unless pushed to take it.</p>
              <p>Go observe at Tampines Int for 291/293 - you will know what I am saying.</p>
              <p>812 has pretty high loading and very bad frequency. 800 is better but then is long winding to get to MRT. </p>

              <p>On feeder service: depends on the bus service. frequency can be between 03-08 minutes. Whether to deploy DDs or not also depends on route length, boarding pattern and loading. Can't generalize. If you ask me specific, can give you my thoughts.</p>
              <p>On the job: You are right... It is not for me.. I am the Head of Sales &amp; Operations... why will I do assistant/deputy manager role!?!? Also, this is a hobby... so let me pursue it... The speed at which govt bodies work is not for me.. But if there are few quacks from LTA here... they can get feedback from few ppl and know what general public is thinking...</p>
              <p>also. I have a team of 100+ sales people... I often talk to them about how they travel.. where they live.. good way to connect with them.. and I keep getting complaints from them as well.. some like in Tampines area/Bedok area/Jurong East/Teban/Hougang are very happy with quality of bus service. Those in Yishun/CCK/Woodlands/Yew Tee/Bukit Panjang keep complaining all the time... all the time.. Hence, my bias for SBST over SMRT... but now they are happy with improvements in SMRT services.</p>

              <p>no BSEP slots for 812, AMDEP pose problem to DDs (i.e. not DD friendly). 811 could perform a SD to DD from WLDEP side, but SMRT has to tackle the DD-hungry monster 190, unless from BSEP.</p>

              <p>Whenever I have taken 800, I see it has a completely different catchment area. Around 60-65 pax alight on two stops along Yishun Ring Road before ave 2. The ring road part after ave 2, where 812 joins in... 800 is left often with 20-25 pax only. This goes to show all of west Ring road relies majorly on 812. </p>

              <p>LTA should ask the contractors it a must to provide at least a standard air-con 45 sitter and the years of the bus must be less than 5 years and well maintenance. also put up a proper sign showing the service like sbst old days. this is a basic standard and surprise that LTA just let the operator using sub standard bus. i wonder is this for show or what?? maybe the pressure of last election getting to LTA.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I am afraid that long haul service like sbs 50 and smrt 972 are not their cup of tea anymore. Sbs 50 is introduced only after persistent calls for direct link for Punggol to NS and circle line mrt station (Ang mo kio and bishan). Smrt 972 is introduced after a girl took video of how she managed to get on smrt190 at the 13th bus. These 2 services are mostly introduced based on feedbacks.</p>
              <p>So we shall see over the next few months whether any long haul service is introduced, starting with the 5 new services. However, don't hold high hopes or you will be disappointed. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I am not holding high hopes but just voicing disappointment about the way they are going about bus operations.</p>
              <p>From the way the 5 routes have been announced, it seems little that any of these could be long distance routes. Their wording shows that these will be short-haul to benefit the individual districts. Hope I am wrong.</p>

              <p>Quite interesting to see SMRT getting the PPSS tenders under their Bus Plus subsidiary... Wonder if they will only use the Bus Plus minibuses or draw from SMRT's parent fleet of 12m buses. Although 12m buses would definitely be more suitable, using SMRT buses would kind of defeat the whole purpose of PPSS, which is supposed to "tap on the resources of private operators", not further strain the resources of public transport operators, especially SMRT which barely has enough buses to cope with their regular, basic bus ops.</p>
              <p>Also note the rather low bids from bus plus for PPSS, roughly $1 million for each svc (lowest is $780 000 for 265P), whereas the PPSS tenders previously awarded were mostly above $1 million. Possibly SMRT/ bus plus is more cost competitive than the private operators since they have a larger fleet of buses readily available, which also have the ez link card readers already fitted.</p>

              <p>Talking about the new BSEP service in Kallang, I feel that Haig Rd MAY be counted as Kallang/Geylang area.</p>
              <p>Just now I was trying to find the BSEP map for 2014 Q3 (which indicates the 5 new services), but unfortunately it was deleted from the LTA website. Then I accidently found this map for 2013 Q1: http://www.publictransport.sg/content/dam/publictransport/pdf/Bus%20Service%20Enhancement%20Programme/LTA%20Map%2027Mar13(3)(FINAL).pdf</p>
              <p>In this map, sv 76 is listed under Kallang/Geylang. However, sv 76 only plies Paya Lebar Rd and Tg Katong Rd, which is nowhere close to Kallang at all. If in this case sv 76 can still be counted as a Kallang/Geylang area service, Haig Rd should be possible as well. Therefore, I think the new Kallang service MAY be for Haig Rd.</p>

              <p>Loyang district includes:</p>
              <p>- Loyang Industrial Estate</p>
              <p>- Old Tampines Road</p>
              <p>- Upper Changi North (not industrial estate though)</p>
              <p>- Flora</p>
              <p>* Considering this my guess is the Loyang service will be one of the two options</p>
              <p>1. Loyang Industrial Estate South (where sv 6 does not ply)</p>
              <p>2. Flora Dr where huge condo complexes are coming up (some already ready, some under construction). This is road parallel to Flora road</p>
              <p>I don't see any other area in Loyang that needs bus service apart from these two. I think #2 is more likely than #1. Any other thoughts for Loyang service?</p>

              <p><br>If I'm not wrong, in the original map the new services is listed under Loyang/Changi area. So this new service may also be for Changi South or Changi Airport.</p>
