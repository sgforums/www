              <p>Hey bro... what's your issue with sv 28? The route is superb... do you know how packed these buses are coming out of st 45/31 as a point to point connection to Bedok and other parts of city. If sv 28 was not there, commuteres would take feeder to Tampines and then MRT to Bedok / Paya Lebar etc. In one message we say we need more services with point to point connection, in other messages we call it long winding. </p>
              <p>sv 28 has now 20 DDs and only 4 SDs remaining in its fleet. At all, we need more routes like these in towns like Yishun etc so that not everyone needs to go to interchange to take bus.</p>

              <p>Even a small change such as extending 853 to Yishun St 61 or Ave 4 can help a great deal. MRT connection on two sides, more direct than 812.</p>

              <p>I was quoting svc 28 as an example for new service so that they wont follow the same winding stuff,28 is a result of two former Tampines feeders that been withdrawn..I rather retain the former feeders and let 28 run with more direct routes..How to encourage car drivers to switch to PT when most of the trunks is so winding??</p>

              <p>28 originally plied the whole stretch of Ave 9 (between St 41 and Ave 7) since intro. It was amended to St 45/34/32 in 2003 but not to replace any feeders. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">291 plied the St 33 side after merging with 295, while </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">293 plied the St 45 side after merging with 297.

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, it is about time for new services. There are totally 0 new services announced ever since Feb 2015. The few new services announced in April 2015 about CCK services were actually announced in feb 2015 initially and were postponed to april as a result of some discussion with residents of CCK. Extension of Sbs 103 in June 2015 did not count as a new service. Neither is amendment of route around bukit panjang area for smrt 972. For totally 5 months, all of us are kept further in suspense with no official announcement. Hope we have a breakthrough this week. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Apparently, the "53M" on SBST timetable is a uni-directional service and has the same route as 53A. Its operating hours are weekdays AM peak and weekend mornings (53A does not operate during the latter, if I'm not wrong).</p>

              <p>53M will be full day service doing 53A/B route IMO. Just that it might start from Bishan Interchange rather than NEX.</p>

              <p>Logically makes more sense right.. given that Punggol west has huge number of HDBs coming up and just 43/43M cannot do the job. Also you need a service to connect Punggol west to Punggol road/TPE bus stops to transfer to 3/34/82/83/136 and 27/39/88/89/858/969 respectively. When the bus crossed Punggol field also gives opportunity to transfer to 62/119.</p>

              <p>Doesn't matter... my answer still holds valid... Not talking about BBT/BPJ anyway as I think it is highly unlikely and not sure there is demand as well.</p>
              <p>Those working near those areas won't choose to come live in Punggol... except for minority who would already know the connectivity is bad... and have a car instead... </p>
