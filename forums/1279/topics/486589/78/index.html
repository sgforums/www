              <p>Hi mr proudtobeme, sbs 63M is not counted as a BSEP launch. As of yr 2015, there are 54 BSEP services launched. Sbs 382G/W is the 55th BSEP service. It is launched on 3 jan 2016. There will be 2 more coming up by Q1 2016. 1 for eunos and Marine parade. 1 for yishun. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes smrt 972 launch as a new service much earlier on is counted as a BSEP service. However its subsequent amendment to senja is just considered as an improvement. Not a new BSEP service again. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Okay instead of Koon Seng, you are making it ply Joo Chiat Place (sv 33 route) but what is advantage of doing Marine Terrace/Crescent when they will have sv 13 that is more direct to Eunos instead of winding around Joo Chiat narrow streets.</p>
              <p>Actually the whole Eunos-Marine Parade is really odd and hope LTA reconsiders this and rather looks at Eunos-Chai Chee-Bedok North-Tanah Merah-CBP service.</p>

              <p>* Given that Frankel Ave is so poorly connected and only option
                          is 32 to Bedok MRT, could make sense to have new service to Eunos
                          MRT</p>
              <p>* This will also leverage conenctivity of Eunos to East Coast /
                          Marine Parade / Upper East Coast</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thanks for finally thinking about Frankel! It is very badly served. But your route won't work as the bus stop along Sims Av East/Kembamgan MRT is too close to the right-turn into Frankel. East Coast to Eunos is already covered via 155. Plus EC to Eunos is really not very pressing. </span></p>
              <p>Why is everybody ignoring the elephant in the room? I really hope this future service will serve the Kembangan/Marine Parade sector. You guys should ride 42 into Lengkong Tiga/Empat to see how populated that estate has become because of new condos. </p>
              <p>And yes, a Eunos-Koon Seng loop in itself would be a waste. </p>
              <p> Of course, nobody saw 47 coming. But if it is a Eunos-Haig Rd-MP-Kemb service, my money is on:</p>
              <p>Eunos-Still Rd-Koon Seng/Dunman-Haig Rd-MP-Siglap Rd-Changi Rd-Jln Kembangan-Frankel-EC-Siglap-MP-Haig-Dunman/Koon Seng-Still Rd-Eunos</p>
              <p> Pros</p>
              <p>1. Direct connection between Eunos MRT &amp; Koon Seng. Svc 33 via Kembangan is a very poor connection. </p>
              <p>2. Direct connection between Koon Seng/Haig Rd to Parkway Parade. Enhances connection to MP provided by 16 which can be very crowded at times.</p>
              <p>3. Direct connection between Kembangan MRT/Siglap/Frankel and MP. Many amenities along MP that are not optimally connected to these estates. These include many schools, MP library &amp; CC, MP market, and Parkway Parade. </p>
              <p>4. Provides a direct connection from Kembangan MRT to Frankel Av which does not exist. Service 42's loop into Fidelio Street is very time consuming. </p>
              <p> Cons</p>
              <p>1. Duplicates 15 &amp; 966. However, this is a more circuitous version, so commuters will still opt for 15/966. Duplicating these services is unavoidable. </p>
              <p>2. Duplicates 42 between Siglap Rd to Kembangan MRT. However, 42 does not serve the full stretch of Siglap Rd. As for Frankel, this bus serves one side only, which is not covered by 42. </p>

              <p>For goodness sake, Frankel Avenue is not Serangoon Gardens or Lentor Estate. It is a 4-lane road connecting Changi &amp; East Coast Rd. I believe LTA is not that goondoo to recognise that Kembangan Estate needs better connections. I have always maintained that this is my priority in the MP routes I have planned. Frankel Avenue COULD benefit from such a service indirectly. I have prioritised using Frankel Av over Siglap Rd/Telok Kurau (roads with private housing estates) due to the relatively poorer coverage on Frankel Av. I agree with you that HDB estates should have more resources distributed to them. But if private housing estates are to get a handful of services, why can't you get them right?  What use is 32? It doesn't serve the nearest MRT station directly. It doesn't bring me to my shopping/schooling options at Marine Parade Rd. It can at times be terribly unreliable. Why would I want to take a roundabout route to Bugis or need a direct service to Margaret Drive? And then LTA touts how it's making Sg a car-lite society? Do you see the irony? Honestly, all of these legacy routes (pre-SBS routes), should just be re-planned. Get rid of 32 as far as I'm concerned! But of course, LTA will never cut routes under the current climate. So I can only hope that they recognise how hopeless the situation is. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this sort of suggestion may have been good in the past but not now. Suddenly eunos will have 2 bus services out of a sudden where currently sbs 15 goes to Marine parade loop only. </p>
              <p>Going by this example, eunos only gains an extra service Sbs 46 and also sbs 15. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Currently sbs 15 already goes there but not terminates there. So this will make eunos interchange more packed than ever. Leave the slot for other new services in future rather than sbs 15. Like that, residents will gain more since it is going to take up space inside the interchange. Cheers. Thanks.</span></p>

              <p>Definitely agree that number 46 will be used if it was a new service. </p>
              <p>Possible routing but I feel it is not very likely because of the sheer route length. To use an analogy,  47 will be the 120 of Marine Parde; the longest and most fleet intensive BSEP route for the area. 46 is likely to be a 121/122. While I definitely agree that a connection from MP to SportsHub will be much appreciated, it is no CBP. It's more of a leisure destination that can be reached quite comfortably via Mountbatten Road or by transfering to CCL at Dakota MRT. I like that Tanjong Rhu has a new connection but in LTA's mind I think 2 services with MRT/bus connections will be enough. I don't think they'd want to canabalise 11's loading any further. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tanjong Rhu can hope for AM split shift fleet adds to 11 to boost morning peak frequencies or a City-Direct service.</span></strong> Another possibility is to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">extend service 11 to Sims Place</span></strong>, thereby creating a direct link between Sims Dr/Geylang Rd &amp; SportsHub without having to do an MRT transfer for such a short distance. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It could also help with enhancing connectivity between Sims Dr/Geylang Rd/Aljunied MRT currently only provided by service 125. This would mean higher loading and higher frequencies as a result.</span></strong> I also like that Meyer Rd finally has a service of its own. But I because of the layout of Meyer Road, I feel it is destined to be overlooked by LTA. </p>
              <p>Cutting back 15 I highly doubt will happen. There is substantial demand between Kaki Bukit/Bedok Reservoir and Marine Parade. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this sort of suggestion may have been good in
              the past but not now. Suddenly eunos will have 2 bus services out
              of a sudden where currently sbs 15 goes to Marine parade loop
              only. </p>
              <p>Going by this example, eunos only gains an extra service Sbs 46
              and also sbs 15. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Currently
              sbs 15 already goes there but not terminates there. So this will
              make eunos interchange more packed than ever. Leave the slot for
              other new services in future rather than sbs 15. Like that,
              residents will gain more since it is going to take up space inside
              the interchange. Cheers. Thanks.</span></p>

              <p>Hi mr iveco, what I mean is that the eunos interchange spaces and berths will be better put to good use by having totally new services and not wasted on a current shortened service such as sbs 15. The spaces should either still be left empty for future new services rather than sbs 15. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>For goodness sake, Frankel Avenue is not Serangoon Gardens or
              Lentor Estate. It is a 4-lane road connecting Changi &amp; East
              Coast Rd. I believe LTA is not that goondoo to recognise that
              Kembangan Estate needs better connections. I have always maintained
              that this is my priority in the MP routes I have planned. Frankel
              Avenue COULD benefit from such a service indirectly. I have
              prioritised using Frankel Av over Siglap Rd/Telok Kurau (roads with
              private housing estates) due to the relatively poorer coverage on
              Frankel Av. I agree with you that HDB estates should have more
              resources distributed to them. But if private housing estates are
              to get a handful of services, why can't you get them right?
               What use is 32? It doesn't serve the nearest MRT station
              directly. It doesn't bring me to my shopping/schooling options at
              Marine Parade Rd. It can at times be terribly unreliable. Why would
              I want to take a roundabout route to Bugis or need a direct service
              to Margaret Drive? And then LTA touts how it's making Sg a car-lite
              society? Do you see the irony? Honestly, all of these legacy routes
              (pre-SBS routes), should just be re-planned. Get rid of 32 as far
              as I'm concerned! But of course, LTA will never cut routes under
              the current climate. So I can only hope that they recognise how
              hopeless the situation is. </p>

              <p>You don't get my point. You have this weird reasoning that just because LTA hasn't done anything means that everything is fine. LTA will have its priorities. Which is why you notice that 122 was introduced after 121 &amp; 120 which serve HDB estates. Also, my point is that 32 doesn't serve the needs of residents. On top of that, 32 has poor frequencies because it is a very long and duplicative route, hence low demand. That is why LTA doesn't want to do fleet adds. It does have some unique sectors though, and in such areas, there should be new services. Granted Frankel Av is a very high end estate, which is why I have combined both Kembangan-Siglap &amp; Frankel, Haig Rd into one service. How is this wasteful when the current bus services in the area don't exist or don't bring residents to places they need to go? That's why there is low demand also, get it. </p>
