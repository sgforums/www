              <p>Even i was surprised to see 41 to be routed via Toh Guan road...
                  when 990 was recently introduced to ply Toh Guan as well, and then
                  you have 183 following same route until Toh Tuck Ave. Very
                  surprising! </p>
              <p>Would have been better to go via IMM and the new hospital
                  complex or Jurong East st 21. Surprised no buses ply Jurong east st
                  21. Road doesn't seem that narrow but cannot do DDs I guess.</p>

              <p>I agree - should have merged 141 and 140 but then you know right... they have to also meet their # of services introduced quota. If you see, sv 35 is also counted as service under BSEP making it 36th service.</p>
              <p>They need 4 more services to complete their quota of 40 services promised by 2014.</p>

              <p>35 shud be getting 2-3 more additional buses for the extension of 8km, extra 16km with both directions. Considering that 35 has 5 buses for it's old 17km route, 35 might get DDs considering the fact that most of the BSEP extension/routes has DD upgrades eg. 119. So 35's new route would be 33km?</p>

              <p>35 shud be getting 2-3 more additional buses for the extension
              of 8km, 16km in both directions. Considering that 35 has 5 buses
              for it's 17km route? 35 might get DDs considering the fact that
              most of the BSEP extension/routes has DD upgrades eg. 119</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>35 should get DDs considering if Alps shuttle is getting shut, then AM/PM peak, you can expect huge office crowd from Alps as well as Xillin Ave. This will warrant DDs.</p>
              <p>Anyway, AM peak you can already spot sv 35 buses carrying 55-60 pax at Tanah Merah MRT.. This means current buses have only 10-15 pax capacity. Hence, will either need DDs or 3-4 SDs. I would prefer, it gets 2 DDs from BSEP. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, normally they will not stick to the schedule exactly. Give them +2 months from end 2014 committed. Since 36 services are introduced already, the next 4 should be the ones from CCK, yishun, sengkang and Punggol which are already made known to public. Expected announcement should be in 1st week of January 2015 after Christmas/new year holidays. Normally they give out news about the next few upcoming areas earlier. Cheers.</p>

              <p>i feel they should introduce more trunk services in the mould of 50, its extremely popular and if the routes are well-planned they would be a massive hit just like 50. also no more express services to be introduced?</p>
              <p>and if it is true that LTA suka suka plan route just to fulfil quotas then it is not only a serious misuse of taxpayers dollars but also limited resources. i can think of a few poorly planned routes off my head IMO such as 116 and even 990 that are usually running empty. even the effectiveness of 859A and 859B is questionable as most of the time i see them running empty, although off peak but even so 859 is still crowded. maybe BSEP should also include further small scale rationalization, not simply introducing more SWTs and routes that turn out to be duds.</p>
