Also, there could be plans for it to be extended via Ave 7, Keat Hong Link and/or CCK Grove, new roads in the area that are not ready yet.

              <p>As for the extension of 386, this could be due to feedback that the current route is not v useful as it only links to Punggol MRT/LRT, which does not have a mall yet (Waterway point still under construction), thus the extension to Punggol Plaza and the facilities at Tebing Lane. This may be a temporary extension though, as Edgefield plains residents would likely prefer to go Waterway point when completed, and Edgefield plains would be extended in future, with the area north of the waterway being further developed. When the time comes, we could see the route being amended or split, similar to 300 and 301 at CCK now.</p>

              <p>Hi mr 201911, if sbs 386 really gets amended in future, another bus service needs to ply edgedale plains and loop at Punggol east like currently now. It is not possible they leave the bus stop at horizon primary school and greendale primary school empty without any bus services. Anyway it is high time edgedale plains get a bus service as the road does not have bus service for more than 13 years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the amended sbs 386 is good. In one direction, it still goes direct to waterway point (mall up end of yr 2015). In another direction, it goes to Punggol field (plaza) and Punggol east (tebing lane). Cheers.</p>

              <p>I doubt coz it is under BSEP. So no bendies will be on 301. That's why I feel there will be more buses deployed, such that frequency is high. Also to mitigate the no-bendy effect, you have the redundant service (as-of-now) 983 also serving ave 5. so should be okay.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs7557R, then empty bus stop for horizon primary school with no service? For it to serve horizon primary school, sbs 3 has to re-route to Punggol drive then edgedale plains then Punggol field then Punggol road to TPE. Sbs 3 route is already windibg enough.</p>
              <p>Not feasible la. Then Punggol central residents lose another service. Furthermore, sbs 3 is a trunk service. Pasir ris st 71 residents are totally affected by longer runtime. What is needed is to increase no of service to Punggol central and not to reduce. They already recognize this by giving you half a service in sbs 386 (I say half is because it is indirect route to mrt). Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr proudtobeme, I think you miss the gist of the issue. I know sbs 3 current loading is very good and connects west to east for pasir ris. </p>
              <p>If they follow suggestions to route further the routes in Punggol, all I can say is good luck to those living in pasir ris at 71. Then you can expect more bunching of sbs 3 due to 1) more routing in Punggol 2) unpredictable TPE condition. Those living inside pasir ris st 71 only have doorstep sbs 3 unless they want to walk to main road pasir ris drive 1 which is not our point currently. If sbs 3 has more and more bunching, you can expect people to wait longer once they miss the bus. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr azharji, we expect daily ridership to improve slightly for sbs 386 because it serves horizon primary school and greendale primary school. It may become sort of school bus at certain timings. People are already asking whether the new bus stops outside horizon and greendale will be constructed in time for 14 feb 2015. Cheers.</p>
