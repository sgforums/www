              <p>Public Transport sg not always 100% reliable tbh since they are not LTA nor are they affilated. Anyway the upcoming bsep services hasn't been updated there since May or June other than for cds services so I think for now cannot depend on there just have to wait and see...</p>

              <p>Corporation Road needs a new service. Right now only covered by 178 and partly by 79. I think the service will originate from Boon Lay once some services get shifted to Joo Koon. It might do part of the industrial area before looping Corporation road. </p>

                  <p>Split up 178, such that it plys between Boon Lay and Bt Batok Depot, and hand over to SBST. May have road adjustments from JTH Rd to Jurong East MRT and Bt Batok, or extension to Joo Koon. The shorter route makes it easier to boost frequency, and will be extremely helpful after the high-speed rail opens. The remaining section can be routed as Bt Batok - Woodlands, and renumbered 968.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, I understand totally. That is why I put in my sentence 'a sign of things to come??? Not sure but looks highly likely.' Anyway hope so. The last time I saw this sort of training bus phenomenon, sbs 386 got extended to this end of Punggol central a few weeks after. Just hope for the best. Cheers.</p>

              <p>With regards to the new bus service in Jurong, I feel that there is no need for another bus route at Corporation Road. There is already a well-established set of bus routes at Corporation Drive. We can extend route 49 to Jurong East Bus Interchange, to complement route 178 at AYE, while provide direct bus connection to Jurong East Bus Interchange from Taman Jurong.</p>
                      <p>Personally, if you ask me, I feel that what Corporation Road needs is more street lights at night. At night, it's quite dark and there's hardly any people out on the streets at Corporation Road. Alternatively, JTC can make changes to land use plans to have high-rise industrial buildings along Corporation Road - similar to the ones coming up at Bu Lim Avenue - to make the place brighter at night and more safe to be in.</p>

              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">A new supplementary service - Service 53M - will be rolled out on Sunday, 16 August 2015. Service 53M supplements Service 53 along the sector between Hougang Avenue 1 and Serangoon Central. Service 53M will also enhance connectivity to Serangoon MRT/bus interchange and local amenities.</p>
              <p style="color: #665a4a; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, Tahoma; font-size: 11px; line-height: normal;">It will ply along Hougang Avenue 1, Lorong Ah Soo, Upper Paya Lebar Road, Serangoon Central and Upper Serangoon Road. Besides enhancing the connectivity to key transport nodes, it will also provide convenient access for commuters to schools - Paya Lebar Girls' School and Yuying Secondary School - as well as to amenities such as the market/food centre along Hougang Avenue 1 and the Aljunied Community Club.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busnalayser, in the context where I was making for Sbs 43M at that time, I am right. Because you want to make SBS 43M start from serangoon interchange which is wrong. The M service will ply route similar to the parent service including its interchange. However the route you suggest for sbs 43M deviate in the sense that it copies the route but use a different interchange</p>
              <p>For sbs 53M, it still follows a portion of the parent route 53. For your case which you suggest for sbs 43M, it is different. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              Actually, I don't think an 'M' variant can only call at the stops of its parent route and nothing else. 70M, 107M and 162M are some examples. 63M also has one stop different from 63 at MacPherson (where 63 is turning into Merpati Rd). 143M and 43M also have some bus stops which their parent services do not ply.
              Maybe you will say these services still use the same interchange/terminal as their parent route. But there is 17A which starts from BNDEP, and that's not a terminal for svc 17. Although 17A is technically not an 'M' varient, I would say it's operating in the same way as the 'M' varients. Another such example is 170X which starts from Kranji Station. If 17A can do this, I don't see a reason why 43M cannot start from Serangoon Int.

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this is not about being stubborn or what. We are not here to pamper to all other persons in this forum. Or else, no need to discuss anything here already. Everybody goes with agreeing.</p>
              <p>Lucky I believe LTA makes the right choice in its current route for sbs 43M. Sbs 43M serves as a mini feeder for Punggol residents from interchange to nearby areas and vice versa. They need it much more due to that part of island only have sbs 43/43M. Certainly more crucial than at NEX to Buangkok green. NEX area has too many bus sercices. If there is no 43M, those residents will only have 43. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
