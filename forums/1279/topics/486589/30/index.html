              <p>When a route is edited, there will tend to be connections lost. When this happens, there has to be alternative routes providing such connections. In the case of the recently published route amendments, the connection between Avenue 5 and Avenue 2 was lost.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I feel that the authorities should just retain the "main structure" of route 300 and simply extend it to make it bi-directional. They may want to re-route the part at Ave 5 to ply Ave 6 instead of Ave 3, so as to increase the route's coverage at Ave 5. Please refer to <a href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=60">my route suggestion about it posted at the Route Suggestions (Part 5) thread</a>.</p>
              <p>According to the masterplan, there may be a new secondary school built at Ave 5 in future. It may be wise to have enhanced bus connection to Ave 5.</p>
              <p>The only road they can afford to skip is Avenue 3, so long as the route continues to ply Ave 4 and Ave 2, because affected commuters can simply take 300 from Ave 4/2. Even with such little changes, it will bring about significant benefits, such as a shorter connection to Avenue 2 from CCK int.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the future new trunk route, it should serve places where future establishments will be built. It should avoid duplicating more than 50% of a feeder route. There is apparently some major development (apart from residential) coming up at Choa Chu Kang Grove, according to the master plan. It may be wise to have a new trunk route to connect Choa Chu Kang residential areas (including Bukit Panjang and Teck Whye) to the upcoming major developments in the area.</p>

              <p>Hi mr marvel68, hip hip hooray if it is true. Everybody should
              have known by now the demand is damn great but sbs 3 is too winding
              to pasir ris/tampines. Obviously smrt 969 (full most of the times
              at TPE stop) and current sbs 34 (single deck) cannot handle the
              booming population in Punggol!!! I look forward to the good news.

              <p>True. Even after adding 4 BSEP to sv 34, loading has been very high. Not just in Punggol, even within Tampines town, sv 34 is always packed. </p>

              <p>When a route is edited, there will tend to be connections lost.
              When this happens, there has to be alternative routes providing
              such connections. In the case of the recently published route
              amendments, the connection between Avenue 5 and Avenue 2 was
              lost.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I feel that the authorities should just retain
              the "main structure" of route 300 and simply extend it to make it
              bi-directional. They may want to re-route the part at Ave 5 to ply
              Ave 6 instead of Ave 3, so as to increase the route's coverage at
              Ave 5. Please refer to <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=60">my route suggestion about it
              posted at the Route Suggestions (Part 5) thread</a>.</p>
              <p>According to the masterplan, there may be a new secondary school
              built at Ave 5 in future. It may be wise to have enhanced bus
              connection to Ave 5.</p>
              <p>The only road they can afford to skip is Avenue 3, so long as
              the route continues to ply Ave 4 and Ave 2, because affected
              commuters can simply take 300 from Ave 4/2. Even with such little
              changes, it will bring about significant benefits, such as a
              shorter connection to Avenue 2 from CCK int.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the future new trunk route, it should serve places
              where future establishments will be built. It should avoid
              duplicating more than 50% of a feeder route. There is apparently
              some major development (apart from residential) coming up at Choa
              Chu Kang Grove, according to the master plan. It may be wise to
              have a new trunk route to connect Choa Chu Kang residential areas
              (including Bukit Panjang and Teck Whye) to the upcoming major
              developments in the area.</p>

              <p>Having svc 300 ply Ave 5/6/1 instead of Ave 3/1 (between Ave 4 and Ave 2) would maintain the connection between Ave 5 and Ave 2, but would remove the direct connection between Ave 4, 5 and 2, and Sunshine Plaza at the junction of Ave 3 and Ave 1. Residents can still walk there from the bus stops along Ave 1 and Ave 2, but it may be a bit far.</p>
              <p>To maintain both the Sunshine Plaza link as well as the Ave 5/2 link, svc 300 can ply your suggested route but make an extra loop around Sunshine Plaza (Ave 1, Ave 3, CCK Terrace) in both directions. The left turn from Ave 3 into CCK Terrace is quite tight though.</p>
              <p>I think a balance needs to be struck between having long, winding svcs that do not require transfers, and having shorter svcs that are more direct but require walking or transfers for pax to go where they want. The original plan for 300G/W, 301 and 983 is more of the latter, and residents are naturally unhappy. Let's see how far the amended plan tilts the balance the other way.</p>

              <p>The primary objective of feeder bus is to connect people from their house to a MRT station. For the direct connection between Avenue 4, 5 and 2, the authorities may want to instead re-route existing trunk routes or have a new trunk route, to provide such connections.</p>
              <p>Anyway, is there really a need for such a bus connection, when people can easily <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">walk</span></strong>? Seriously, if my house to the market is 400m-500m away and although there's no bus connection, I can walk (slowly) and reach there within within 5 minutes, I do not see why people at Avenue 4, 5 and 2 cannot just walk to SunShine Place.</p>
              <p>At most, create a trunk route that begins/ends with this section:</p>
              <p></p><ol>

              <p>After Ave 5, go Ave 6, Ave 1, Ave 2. After that, come back to Keat Hong... wind round and round...</p>
              <p>seriously, not every neighbourhood centre must connect to every part of the town la. A good example is Pioneer Mall at Jurong West. Pioneer Mall is connected by bus to every region except Jurong West Street 91. </p>
              <p>why should we give people staying at Choa Chu Kang extension bus connection to every market or shopping malls in the area, when people staying elsewhere also do not have absolute bus connections to everywhere in their neighbourhood, and have been walking for so many years without complaining?</p>

              <p>Hi mr jurongwestresident, 2 issues.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there is this connection for years and it is suddenly removed. Residents will definitely voice out. If it happens to you, will you keep quiet and accept it?</p>
              <p>Secondly, not every resident is as fit as you. Can walk and run! There are residents from 7 yrs old to 90 years old. Some may be carrying heavy bags, some may be having two hands full of groceries, some just don't like walking, some unfit, older residents have medical condtions to legs. Some are going to run errands then transfer again (so no extra cost). So your statements are not too valid. Cheers.</p>

              <p>To compensate for the loss of connection between CCK Ave 5 and CCK Ave 4, and to provide for a shorter connection to Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, we can have that new trunk route 983 which has this section in its route:</p>

              <li>...</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In short, simply make the current route 300 skip CCK Ave 5, change the planned route 301 and continue to have route 983 as originally planned.</p>
              <p>Keep the current route 300 and have new routes 301 and 983. </p>

              <li>Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Since the demand for bus connection to Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1
              and Avenue 2 is so strong, we should let routes 300 and 301
              duplicate at this section (Ave 3 - Ave 1 - Ave 2 - CCK Way - CCK
              Ave 4 - CCK Loop)</p>
              <p>To reduce duplication, what we can do is to revert route 300
              back to it's current route, except now we make it skip CCK Ave
              5.</p>
              <p>To compensate for the loss of connection between CCK Ave 5 and
              CCK Ave 4, and to provide for a shorter connection to Choa Chu Kang
              Bus Interchange, we can have that new trunk route 983 which has
              this section in its route:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>...</li>
              <li>...</li>
              <li>...</li>
              <li>Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4</li>
              <li>Choa Chu Kang Avenue 5</li>
              <li>...</li>
              <li>...</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In short, simply make the current route 300 skip CCK Ave 5,
              change the planned route 301 and continue to have route 983 as
              originally planned.</p>
              <p>Keep the current route 300 and have new routes 301 and
              983. </p>

              <p>Sorry to say but I don't think you understand the loading pattern for this area at all. ave 2 needs connection because there is a pri school there and that's why residents are not happy because their children will no more have direct service. This does not warrant two services to duplicate there because outside of school timings there is not much demand between these two areas. </p>

              <p><br> Actually, it's just one and a half bus services. 301 serving both directions, while 300 only serve one direction (loop; as per current routing).</p>
              <p>If this adjustment to bus network is because of the new HDB developments, I think we should just delete that small "tail" of 300 and have a new feeder serving that area.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the new feeder may serve Ave 2 to provide for direct connection to bus interchange for people staying there. No need for 300 to become bi-directional.</p>
              <p>Even with 301 serving Ave 2, 300 is required to maintain the connection between Ave 2 and Ave 4. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Deleting that "tail" can also enable people staying at Ave 4 a shorter bus ride to Ave 2.</span></p>
              <p>Choa Chu Kang Primary School is not the only reason why people go to Choa Chu Kang Avenue 2. There are at least six landmarks at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 2 which people from other parts of Choa Chu Kang may need/want to go. Choa Chu Kang Avenue 2 is somewhat the neighbourhood centre of this section of Choa Chu Kang town.</p>
              <p>Just delete that "tail" of 300 and have new 301 serving Ave 2 and Ave 5, and every objectives of this bus network adjustment is met already. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whereas for the connection between Ave 4 and Ave 5, we can let a new trunk bus route provide it. :)</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, I am sure the people in the official groups involved in this bus network adjustment know which are the bus connections the people at Choa Chu Kang West need/want. Hopefully this can be read by the people who are really in the official groups involved in this adjustment. This suggestion of mine is to help them decide on the final plan.</p>
