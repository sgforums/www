              will probably still choose 39/858 since it is faster. Not really an

              <p>I see that the route for Svc 117 skips the West Camp Road sector also. So means that Svc 103 is the main service on the West Camp Road sector before hitting Yishun Ave 1</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2652G, yes this time round I think you are right.
                  Another service for Punggol is coming up. Feeder 382G/W. Looks
                  interesting this time! Cheers. Thanks.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have analysed the area on the map. Yes, a bi-directional feeder bus service would be better for the new residential developments in the area.</p>
              <p>This is how I think the new feeder bus route would be:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus Interchange</span></strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Place</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Field</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Lane (future road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">loop (future road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Crescent (future road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Walk (future road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">loop (future road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Link</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Central</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Place</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus Interchange</span></strong></span></li>
              </ol>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Length = up to 5.4 km</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>However, there are (many) roads not yet constructed/open. If introduced now, a large part of it is likely to change in the (near) future.</p>
              <p>If introduced now, I guess this is how the route would be:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus Interchange</span></strong></span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Place</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Field</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Central</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Way</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Link</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Central</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Place</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus Interchange</span></strong></span></li>
              </ol>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Length = around 3.5 km</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Actually, I feel that there is not yet the need for this bus service, as most of its catchment area is still under construction.</p>
              <p>For a start, I think it is better to let it ply only the the eastern section (Punggol Bus Interchange - Sumang Link) and loop there.</p>
              <p>Progressively, as new roads are open and new BTO flats are ready, we could extend it.</p>
              <p>Eventually, it could become the bi-directional bus service which it is planned to be.</p>

              <p>Am I the only one who's disappointed with 47? Major duplication

              <p>If 47 was just to connect CBP with Marine Parade, I would rather
              extend 135 to CBP via ECP as a more direct link between them. Then
              47 could have been rerouted from Tanah Merah further towards the
              west, passing by Bedok.</p>
              <p>Can expect 38 to be even further away from fleet adds. So

              <p>Maybe you didnt ready my comment 2 posts before yours. 47 is the only service I am disappointed with in this round. Heavy duplication with 12/38/48... I would have preferred if sv 47 would have done Bedok North estate instead before coming down to Marine Parade to loop.</p>
              <p>38 already just a back up service with not-so-good load. With 47 coming in, 38 route can be modified.</p>

              <p>47 is quite good actually in my opinion.  It does serve two
              main purposes:</p>
              <p>1) It relieves the extremely high loading along Marine Parade
              Road, along the Victoria School - Victoria Junior College corridor.
               (Interestingly, 47 more or less covers the route which was
              cut off when that tree fell recently...)  48, which has no
              double deckers, is usually very crowded at peak hours.  31,
              which has double deckers,  is also crowded, possibly due to
              the fact that they already picked up many passengers before heading
              to the 'Victorian' area.  36 has no double-deckers due to
              airport height restrictions, and runs only westbound. The fact that
              47 loops at the west end of Marine Parade Road means that it is
              more dedicated to serve the area, as opposed to 12 which will be
              "cham" with passengers from the city.</p>
              <p>2) it offers a much needed connection eastwards "beyond" Bedok.
              At the bus stops near CHIJ Katong, Neptune Ct and Hua Xin Ct, if
              you want to take the bus to Tanah Merah (a key transport node as
              the bus stop has many buses there, 2, 12, 14, 24 etc etc), 196, 197
              and 43 are out (all 3 of which have the highest frequency), and
              commuters are stuck waiting for 31 or 48, both of which are
              notorious among students of the Victorias, CHIJ and Tao Nan for
              poor frequency.  196 and 197 cut off at Bedok and hence are
              unfeasible for those commuters, and 43 ends off at Upp East Coast
              terminal, which to them, might as well be in the middle of nowhere,
              while 76 terminates at Marine Terrace and doesn't even cover VS as
              it used to.  47 neatly helps to bring people from Marine
              Parade Road eastbound, saving one less transfer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS. I like the route duplication with 12 actually.  12 has
              a ridiculously bad frequency at off-peak hours, and the alternative
              38 has no double deckers, so having another route should relieve
              congestion or at the very least mean a shorter wait.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I am sorry to say but I really dont think you take services in Marine Parade area because so many of your comments are wrong. </p>
              <p>Just go and observe along Marine Parade Road and you will see all the services you have mentioned running empty or mediocre loading during peak hours as well. </p>
              <p>Let me share with you:</p>
              <p><strong>31</strong> - DD loading is bet Tanah Merah and Tampines town, and Boon Keng and Toa Payoh. Within Marine Parade estate usually gets 30-50 pax during peak</p>
              <p><strong>43 </strong>- Loading picks up only bet Parkway Parade and Paya Lebar and then further till Buangkok Dr. Usual loading bet UEC and Parkway Parade is 20-40 pax</p>
              <p><strong>48</strong> - This service got heavy loading throughout. It is a real good candidate for DDs as it gets huge crowd bet Tanah Merah and Bayshore.

              <p><strong>12 </strong>- DD worthy loading is between Bedok South Road to Tanah Merah MRT, Tanah Merah to Simei, Simei to Tampines East CC, PSR Ris Dr 6 to Pasir Ris MRT. It does not cham cham load from city. </p>
              <p><strong>196/197/16</strong> - so many options to Bedok MRT. Mostly buses get 30-35 pax during peak hours bet Bedok/Parkway Parade. Please note my analysis does not include city loading for 196/197/16.</p>
              <p><strong>36</strong> - it is one of the lowest loading CGA service bet Marine Parade and CGA got 20- 30 pax. From Marine Parade to city crowded.</p>

              <p>15 needs to be maintained as it is, as it is the only service catering Tehlok Karau to Parkway Parade... and is always crowded.</p>
              <p>If you see East Coast, the shopping amenities are saturated at Parkway Parade / Marine Parade Central / i12 Katong / Katong Shopping Center. Rest there isn't much. OR you have to go to Bedok mall which is fairly crowded.</p>

              <p>My suggestion would have been to extend to Stadium instead, to provide connectivity between Marine Parade and Stadium/Sports Complex/Kallang Wave/Kallang Leisure Park that is absolutely missing today.</p>

              <p>I have analysed the area on the map. Yes, a bi-directional
              feeder bus service would be better for the new residential
              developments in the area.</p>
              <p>This is how I think the new feeder bus route would be:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Field</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Lane (future
              road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">loop (future
              road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Crescent (future
              road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Walk (future
              road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">loop (future
              road)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Link</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Walk</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Central</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Place</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus
              Interchange</span></strong></span></li>

              km</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>However, there are (many) roads not yet constructed/open. If
              introduced now, a large part of it is likely to change in the
              (near) future.</p>
              <p>If introduced now, I guess this is how the route would be:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punggol Bus

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Punggol Central</span></li>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sumang Link</span></li>

              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Length = around 3.5
              km</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Actually, I feel that there is not yet the need for this bus
              service, as most of its catchment area is still under
              construction.</p>
              <p>For a start, I think it is better to let it ply only the the
              eastern section (Punggol Bus Interchange - Sumang Link) and loop
              there.</p>
              <p>Progressively, as new roads are open and new BTO flats are
              ready, we could extend it.</p>
              <p>Eventually, it could become the bi-directional bus service which
              it is planned to be.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes I agree with you. However judging from the way the authorities are doing things, I feel they will open sam kee LRT which is just besides Punggol safra at the same time. They will make the LRT one direction instead of both directions so as to save cost. This is how they do to other areas in Punggol. For example, trunk sbs 50 comes 7 yrs after Punggol drive flats are first ready in yr 2005. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I am sorry to say but I really dont think you take services in
              Marine Parade area because so many of your comments are
              wrong. </p>
              <p>Just go and observe along Marine Parade Road and you will see
              all the services you have mentioned running empty or mediocre
              loading during peak hours as well. </p>
              <p>Let me share with you:</p>
              <p><strong>31</strong> - DD loading is bet Tanah Merah and Tampines
              town, and Boon Keng and Toa Payoh. Within Marine Parade estate
              usually gets 30-50 pax during peak</p>
              <p><strong>43</strong> - Loading picks up only bet Parkway Parade
              and Paya Lebar and then further till Buangkok Dr. Usual loading bet
              UEC and Parkway Parade is 20-40 pax</p>
              <p><strong>48</strong> - This service got heavy loading throughout.
              It is a real good candidate for DDs as it gets huge crowd bet Tanah
              Merah and Bayshore. Bet Bayshore and Parkway Parade just like other
              services gets 30-40 pax during peak and will pick up again to go
              70+ to Rochor (evening a bit lower). </p>
              <p><strong>12</strong> - DD worthy loading is between Bedok South
              Road to Tanah Merah MRT, Tanah Merah to Simei, Simei to Tampines
              East CC, PSR Ris Dr 6 to Pasir Ris MRT. It does not cham cham load
              from city. </p>
              <p><strong>196/197/16</strong> - so many options to Bedok MRT.
              Mostly buses get 30-35 pax during peak hours bet Bedok/Parkway
              Parade. Please note my analysis does not include city loading for
              196/197/16.</p>
              <p><strong>36</strong> - it is one of the lowest loading CGA
              service bet Marine Parade and CGA got 20- 30 pax. From Marine
              Parade to city crowded.</p>
              <p>So sorry but none of the east bound services are bursting today.
              47 though will be nice for those living along EC/MP/Bedok South to
              get direct connection to CBP.</p>

              <p>My school is one of the schools along the affected 47 stretch.  Don't take my comments on 43 seriously, and you are right about 196 and 197.  You are also spot-on about 12 and 48 (I apologise if I was not clear enough on those).  However, I maintain that the frequency of 31 is still quite bad around the hours of 2.30 to 5pm, which my school is aware of after conducting studies.</p>

              <p>honestly i don't agree vs / vj don't have good bus services to
              begin with, we have services to almost every part of sg, including
              tpy, kallang, je, bukit merah, chinatown, buona vista, je, holland,
              punggol, sengkang, buangkok, hougan, serangoon, pasir ris,
              tampines, bedok, changi airport, town, woodlands, bukit panjang,
              whampoa, and so on .. .and it isn't much of a hassle going to
              either paya lebar / bedok to change into mrt / buses. it is
              students who don't wish to take such long bus services to begin
              with.</p>
              <p>196, 197 although infrequent, but it isn't that nightmarish,
              compared to the 190 loading (before 972 and all the envios BSEP),
              as well as those loadings we see of yishun feeders / tampines
              feeders / even bedok feeders. It's still bearable per say ...</p>
              <p>I am frankly quite disappointed wtih 47, for the connectivity
              with marine parade to bedok south per say, a simple transfer to 12
              / 38 can do it's part, for the tanah merah section to expo, 35 / 35
              M is enough / MRT can be an alternative too ... and CBP is not that
              hard to reach given the options, it seems that it's just a special
              service created to serve mp residents to reach cbp / a mini feeder
              for bedok south residents to tanah merah, which 229 / 38 does the
              route also, for still road, 197 and other services are more than
              adequate</p>
              <p>better routing can be to bedok mrt (where it can then take some
              load for 31 which is quie bad for the bedok int - mp
              section) </p>

              <p>You are quite right.  However, the transfer to 12 and 38 can be not as simple as you say, because 12 frequency between 3pm and 6pm tends to be quite bad, about 20+ minutes.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree that frequency is not great during that time, but it is also related to loading. Buses run empty during this time except for parts where students leave school. I think the bus apps really help most people these days (may not be ideal for students though as not everyone has mobile phone with data)</p>

              <p>Doesn't really make sense to have it operational just for SAFRA when there is no other development in the area. For Punggol Dr it was different as huge HDBs were open and people live there.</p>

                                  discussed ad nauseam but I really feel some of its defenders really need to
                                  walk out to East Coast Rd and wait for 32 or 40, or even 155. And that's what
                                  really peeves me off; this route is a nicety at the expense of other interests in the area. With this, I really think
                                  residents in Siglap/Frankel/Kembangan/Chai Chee should be emboldened to ask for
                                  more. I'm sorry, if you don't like 31, you have 48 as well both of which have
                                  seen BSEP adds. And I think you are exagerating how bad their frequencies are.
                                  Service 12 is affected by traffic along Victoria St and Kallang area but so is
                                  32 and even worse. May I also remind you that you have 10 from Simpang Bedok
                                  via East Coast Rd. If you need to tranfer to 2, 9, 24 or 35, these transfers
                                  can also be done at Bedok through 16, 31, 196 and 197. </span></p>

                                  mrbusanalyser for setting things straight. Truth is Marine Parade has an
                                  assortment of Eastbound connections. And I honestly feel that Bedok South &amp;
                                  Tanah Merah were after-thoughts as the route's main objective was primarily
                                  Marine Parade-CBP. Without CBP, this service would never come to being. Bedok
                                  South &amp; Tanah Merah were attched to attract more demand. That is why it is
                                  short of just doing MP&gt;ECP&gt;Xilin&gt;CBP. MP&gt;CBP demand alone would
                                  have made it suffer JIS loading patterns. </span></p>

                      screws up, can't you just walk from Opp Casafina to Bedok South Rd where you
                      have 38 and 229? Or if you're lazy there's an overhead bridge Opp Panasonic
                      connecting you directly with Panasonic bus stop which has 229 and 38??
                  
                  On a side note 38 is unlikely to get down gauged given the connections in Simei it inherited from 290. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Dear CB2883J. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231; font-family: Arial;">I know 47 has been
              discussed ad nauseam but I really feel some of its defenders really
              need to walk out to East Coast Rd and wait for 32 or 40, or even
              155. And that's what really peeves me off; this route is a nicety
              at the expense of other interests in the area. With this, I really
              think residents in Siglap/Frankel/Kembangan/Chai Chee should be
              emboldened to ask for more. I'm sorry, if you don't like 31, you
              have 48 as well both of which have seen BSEP adds. And I think you
              are exagerating how bad their frequencies are. Service 12 is
              affected by traffic along Victoria St and Kallang area but so is 32
              and even worse. May I also remind you that you have 10 from Simpang
              Bedok via East Coast Rd. If you need to tranfer to 2, 9, 24 or 35,
              these transfers can also be done at Bedok through 16, 31, 196 and
              197. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.231;">Thank you mrbusanalyser
              for setting things straight. Truth is Marine Parade has an
              assortment of Eastbound connections. And I honestly feel that Bedok
              South &amp; Tanah Merah were after-thoughts as the route's main
              objective was primarily Marine Parade-CBP. Without CBP, this
              service would never come to being. Bedok South &amp; Tanah Merah
              were attched to attract more demand. That is why it is short of
              just doing MP&gt;ECP&gt;Xilin&gt;CBP. MP&gt;CBP demand alone would
              have made it suffer JIS loading patterns. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And Victorians, please also think of your
              friends living in Kembangan and Chai Chee. Let's take a look at
              their commutes. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blk
              102 Lengkong Tiga - Marine Parade Rd</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">42 &gt; 2,7,24, 25 etc &gt; 16, 196 ,197 (via
              Bedok Int)</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">or 42, Walk to Perpetual Succour Church, take
              32 provided it ever comes, walk from East Coast
              Rd. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">or 42, walk to Perpetual Succour Church, 33
              &gt; 15</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If your friend walks or cycles from VS/VJ via
              Siglap park connector to Kembangan MRT, power la, Nil Sine
              Labore. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chai Chee - Marine Parade
              Rd</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">222/229 &gt; 16, 196, 197 (via Bedok Int) or
              16, 31, 196, 197 (via Bdk Sth Rd). </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">or walk out to New Upp Changi, take 32/40,
              walk from East Coast Rd. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Not as jialat as Kembangan but still your
              Tanah Merah/Bedok Sth friends have alotta direct options. Bedok
              South covered with connections to MP, so should Chai Chee and
              Kembangan given the proximity of these neighborhoods. Even
              BPJ/Woodlands have direct connections.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.231;">Very tough meh. Even if
              12 screws up, can't you just walk from Opp Casafina to Bedok South
              Rd where you have 38 and 229? Or if you're lazy there's an overhead
              bridge Opp Panasonic connecting you directly with Panasonic bus
              stop which has 229 and 38?? On a side note 38 is unlikely to get
              down gauged given the connections in Simei it inherited from
              290.</span></p>

              <p>I take your points about 47 and VS - I don't study there though several of my friends do.  Anyway, I have checked with those friends and we all agree that many of the points about 47 relating to VS, and indeed CHIJ and Tao Nan when it moves back, will become moot when the TEL opens (though that may bring points of its own).  What my Victorian friends are referring to, it turns out, is the connection between their school and Tanah Merah MRT (because apparently, many Victorians take the bus to Tanah Merah and transfer to other buses there).  And many Victorians do use the Park Connector network, though they use it to walk one block and take the 12.  Those who take 47 are likely to be those living in Simei.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I agree with what you have raised about the low coverage of Kembangan area.  My own relatives live in Kembangan and their area is quite under-served. </p>
