              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, to add on, this sbs 386 route is a dead-end. Even if there are more flats to be built up around the waterway next time, sbs 386 must come out of edgefield plains end to go to Punggol drive then to edgedale plains end to serve the flats there. There are no inner roads in between and there will not be any in the future. This is due to the flats are densely built up such that the only road for public bus is in the current looping edgefield plains and edgedale plains (ongoing). For this bus, nobody boards most of the time. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Yesss. I dont get it. Cant LTA see for themselves. Two long haul
              services they introduced sv 50 and sv 972 are doing super good with
              crowded buses and they have needed to add more buses and DDs to
              these services.</p>
              <p>Compare this with mid haul services like 116, 120, 141 that they
              have introduced. Dont even want to mention anything about their
              latest disaster 324... which easily they could have extended to
              Seletar/Sengkang West where more ppl are coming and connected them
              with BGK MRT. But no! want these cheap ass small routes.</p>

              <p>hi mr dupdup77; there is a new road perpendicular behind Edgefield Plains roundabout. and this new road would eventually link to Riveria LRT and punggol mrt. when its opened i think sv386 would be re-routed to ply this new road instead. </p>

              <p>not really. but is almost zero pax to the endpoint of sv386. but there is a small amt of pax travelling up to Edgefield Plains rental flats bus'stop. and some pax hop to this route when this bus arrive ahead of sv3/83/85.</p>
              <p>for sv324&amp;386 during peak, it can be half-seated. at times sv386 has about 25-30 seated pax slong Punggol Ctrl.</p>

              <p>No that is not correct. <strong>In future </strong>(see Punggol master plan), there will be road connecting right from Punggol East to Punggol Way, connecting the entire Waterway BTO complex. Hence, I do foresee that sv 386 in future will loop at Punggol East and come back to interchange via Edgedale Plains, Waterway, Edgefield Plains covering the entire stretch of new BTOs at Waterway. They could also introduce 386G/W variant.</p>
              <p>For me 386 is okay... it a route that is needed given how far Waterway BTOs are from LRT. And given the town expansion, the route will be extended. </p>

              <p>386 is fine. There is no option. For 324, 62/136 bus stop is walking distance - not very far. There was definitely need of new route to Upper Serangoon, only that it needed to be longer. It should have connected even the condos along Buangkok Drive to Buangkok MRT, connected areas of Anchorvale/Fernvale not having robust bus service. Should have been a mid-haul trunk than super-short feeder. </p>

              <p>386 is mainly for waterway banks BTO that is ready and people should start living. I have gone to this area (part of my job) for supervision and have seen that it can be very scary and lonely at night. Hence, I think though flats are ready, people are not eager to move in yet. You will see very few lights in the evening. But the whole complex is completely sold out. </p>
              <p>So we can expect in few months 386 loading to increase. </p>

              <p>No that is not correct. <strong>In future</strong> (see Punggol
                  master plan), there will be road connecting right from Punggol East
                  to Punggol Way, connecting the entire Waterway BTO complex. Hence,
                  I do foresee that sv 386 in future will loop at Punggol East and
                  come back to interchange via Edgedale Plains, Waterway, Edgefield
                  Plains covering the entire stretch of new BTOs at Waterway. They
                  could also introduce 386G/W variant.</p>
              <p>For me 386 is okay... it a route that is needed given how far
                  Waterway BTOs are from LRT. And given the town expansion, the route
                  will be extended. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I am afraid not. That road which connects Punggol east to Punggol way is the Punggol semi-expressway. For the edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end (currently under construction), they are both a looping dead-end with no other connection except need to come out to Punggol drive. So sbs 386 will definitely have to loop and come out to Punggol drive and go into edgedale plains end first. The Punggol semi-expressway will have its own bus services. It will be independent of sbs 386 and edgefield plains end and edgedale plains due to the shape of the roads. Take note the semi-expressway is not linked to edgefield plains end and edgedale plains end. The only way sbs 386 can go and serve those flats deep in is only when the semi-expressway is linked. Unfortunately, it is not. Cheers.</p>

              <p>386 is mainly for waterway banks BTO that is ready and people
              should start living. I have gone to this area (part of my job) for
              supervision and have seen that it can be very scary and lonely at
              night. Hence, I think though flats are ready, people are not eager
              to move in yet. You will see very few lights in the evening. But
              the whole complex is completely sold out. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, definitely will not move in. So far to amenities and other facilities. One of the worst location in Punggol. Still need take bus to nearest amenities. Not near LRT too. Only good thing is the waterway views! Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, ok sorry yes it is connected to semi-expressway by slip roads at edgedale plains and edgefield plains. The semi-expressway is also connected at current Punggol rd and Punggol east. Edgefield and edgedale plains rd seem to be elevated and the semi-expressway seems to be below both edgefield and edgedale plains. If going by such road structures, need at least 3 more services to go all the way inside. Furthermore the edgedale and edgefield plains seem certain to get extended even further up more. Cheers!</p>

              <p>811P seems legit... With the frequency of the current 811... This is worth it, I hope so... <br>812P... Is there even load for passengers going Chong Pang? I boarded 812 before from Chong Pang CC usually maybe the waiting time too long but got alternative 800 to Int...</p>
