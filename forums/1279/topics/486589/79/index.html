              <p>Eunos had 3 routes (13, 15 &amp; M4) removed in 1997. There are
                      2 berths at Eunos that can accommodate one more route each.</p>

              <p>Now that you mention M4, I have a suspicion this service may be re-instated.

Tbh, 76 to Paya Lebar MRT can be a bit lengthy when Eunos MRT is much nearer. Not to mention that 76 can have very poor frequencies at times due to its route length. 13 doesn't serve Eunos MRT directly on the Changi Rd side (the walk is very far) and can also suffer from unreliable service because of route length. 16 &amp; 196 do not connect to EWL. But honestly, if LTA does this, it would be for political reasons. </p>

              <p>76 for Paya Lebar should be enough - connects both EWL and CCL is quite fast. 13 itself is not that crowded from Eunos to Marine Crescent in PM even though stop is just outside. </p>
              <p>The route of M4 will be super-duplicative and waste of resources. If it is Marine Parade new service should be something that connects Marine Parade to Stadium/Tanjong Rhu. </p>
              <p>If they really wanted Marine Cres-Eunos, they could have launched 47 to cover it.</p>

              <p>That is possible as well but wouldn't extending sv 15 create more irregular/unpredictable schedules on return journey to Kaki Bukit/Pasir Ris, where the major part of loading is. </p>

              <p>Tanjong Rhu to Aljunied is already provided via 158. Transfers are available to Geylang along Sims Av. Anyways, connections between Tanjong Rhu and Eunos/Geylang would not attract that much demand with all honesty, so a direct connection is not necessary. </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I concede that Marine Parade has many schools that would attract students living in Tanjong Rhu. However, this can already be made via both 11 and 158 by transfering to 16, 31 and 196 at Mountbatten.</span></strong> It's quite good that residents can rely on more than one service. Beyond this, shopping amenities are already available at SportsHub (which brings me to my next point), so there's no need to go to Parkway Parade. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The majority of condominiums are within a short walk to SportsHub via Geylang River footbridge.</span></strong> This in turn also explains 11's poor loading. So increased frequency may to Stadium may not be very necessary. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"><em> Saving wasted resources as sv 11 loading continues to be poor, though provides unique connection bet Stadium MRT and Tanjong Rhu (20-25 pax) and Stadium MRT to Geylang (10-15 pax). With sv 15 at better frequency and longer route, loading can be expected to improve.</em></span></p>
              <p> I agree though that given the population of Tanjong Rhu, having 2 higher frequency services makes sense. It would be much more beneficial to extend service 11 to Sims Place as this would actually create useful new links for Sims Dr and directly serve Geylang Rd to Stadium. (refer to my service 11 extension in route suggestions).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ultimately, y</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">our route would be extremely duplicative of 12, 14 and 196 along Mountbatten Road, and would merely enhance existing connections already provided by an assortment of services. The unique sectors, namely Tanjong Rhu to Marine Parade may be useful. However, I feel this sector is subordinate to other needs in the area such as Koon Seng Rd, Haig Rd, Kembangan etc, areas which have limited/no bus service. Thus, I feel the current services are adequate enough to serve this sector.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Brilliant! But I doubt that Lengkong Tiga/Empat will see a new service. 42's loadings are low or moderate at Opera Estate/Flamingo Valley; Kembangan Estate really sustains the loadings on this service. Your proposed service 46 can loop at Jalan Kembangan roundabout the same way off service 42's loop around to go back to Eunos Interchange for mealbreaks. </p>

              <p>The Joo Chiat area deserves a new service given all the new condominiums that have popped up. The only issue are narrow roads. The area is actually quite dense for a private housing estate. </p>
              <p>Options 1 &amp; 2 are unlikely. Option 3 is possible but a loop from East Coast Road to Joo Chiat Road is not possible as the left-turning lane from EC to JC is way too narrow for buses. So you would have to reverse the loop to ply Joo Chiat Road &gt; East Coast Rd &gt; Marine Parade Rd &gt; Joo Chiat Rd.</p>
              <p>But I feel that serving Koon Seng Rd is more impactful than Joo Chiat Place. By serving Koon Seng Road, you can serve Haig Girls' School as well as many private apartments/condominiums along the stretch, and commuters would be within walking distance to condominiums in Duku Road. Joo Chiat Place contains more two-storey shophouses. </p>
              <p>Of course, a fellow forummer has just thrown a spanner into the whole discussion by suggesting 76 may be extended to Eunos. If so, then I forsee it will ply Marine Parade Rd &gt; Bedok South Av 1 &gt; Bedok South Rd &gt; New Upp Changi Rd &gt; Changi Rd &gt; Jln Turi. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I can see why as it would serve both Kembangan and Chai Chee, connecting these estates to Marine Parade. But it is a huge loop that will take a damn long time for Kembangan commuters to reach Marine Parade. It won't serve either estates very directly either. It will duplicate so many services along Bedok South Rd/Av 1. Plus extending an already long service is just a recipe for unreliable service. This extension will be about 7 km long, meaning the new route would be up to 25km long. If it actually served Chai Chee Dr and Chai Chee St, which would be much more effective, it would be even longer. </span></p>
              <p>But judging by how LTA thinks, I wouldn't put it past them. They seem most obsessed with loading lately by introducing much longer routes that are very safe. Extending 76 is a very safe option. As usual people in the East lose out :( </p>
              <p>Lost sectors at Marine Terrace can be covered by a new Eunos &gt; Still Rd &gt; Still Rd Sth &gt; Marine Parade Rd &gt; Marine Terrace (Loop). <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              Jln Turi. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I can see why as
              it would serve both Kembangan and Chai Chee, connecting these
              estates to Marine Parade. But it is a huge loop that will take a
              damn long time for Kembangan commuters to reach Marine Parade. It
              won't serve either estates very directly either. It will duplicate
              so many services along Bedok South Rd/Av 1. Plus extending an
              already long service is just a recipe for unreliable service. This
              extension will be about 7 km long, meaning the new route would be
              up to 25km long. If it actually served Chai Chee Dr and Chai Chee
              St, which would be much more effective, it would be even
              longer. </span></p>
              <p>But judging by how LTA thinks, I wouldn't put it past them. They
              seem most obsessed with loading lately by introducing much longer
              routes that are very safe. Extending 76 is a very safe option. As
              usual people in the East lose out :( </p>
              <p>Lost sectors at Marine Terrace can be covered by a new Eunos
              &gt; Still Rd &gt; Still Rd Sth &gt; Marine Parade Rd &gt; Marine
              Terrace (Loop). <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>That's why I myself mentioned option 3 is more probable. Koon Seng Road also possible but road quite small. </p>
              <p>76 extending to Eunos is absurd. It needs to serve Marine Crescent important link to Paya Lebar/Tanjong Katong. </p>

              <p>st 81 has 811 that connects to both Khatib and Yishun - just fine. I think current route is nice. If need be can walk to ave 4 and get 805 (not too far).

              <p>You would have a problem with finding a looping point. The only feasible one is via Yishun Ave 1 --&gt; St 81, but there's 811 there already. Yishun Ave 3 / Ring Rd is bad because 812 west is there and it will cause a service number confusion. Any other combination may result in route duplication and would not serve Khatib MRT station anyway.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to simply amend one of the trunks to St 61. <a title="857 to Yishun St 61" href="/forums/1279/topics/489281?page=56#post_11140693">Such as 857</a>, which has received DDs since 2015.</p>

              <p>yes i also think about that looping point.</p>
              <p>my suggestion go like this.</p>
              <p>812G/W - Yishun Interchange &gt; Yishun Ave 2 &gt; Yishun Ring Road &gt; Yishun St 61 &gt; Yishun Central &gt; Yishun Interchange</p>
