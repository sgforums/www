              <p>Yes 854 will still see good loading, the Jln Eunos &lt;-&gt;

              directly. Perhaps 965 can even go through Seletar North Link to hit
              Punggol directly without even hitting TPE and ending directly at

              <p>Hougang to Eunos already got 25.</p>
              <p>Hope 103 can change contractor as a result of amendment, like 172 in 1999. Should reassign it from Hougang to Sungai Seletar contract area.</p>

              <p>Sort of expected, especially with that two new bus stops
              springing up at Yishun Ave 8.</p>
              <p>Good and sensible move. May mean even less pax for 85.... and
              853 as well. Pax wanting to go Yishun from Serangoon Central may
              take 103 - possibly faster as well since it avoids AMK and the
              jam-prone Lentor, not to mention the long wait for 853. Kudos for
              having another SBST service in Yishun.</p>
              <p>Folks should now REALLY avoid stopping their cars for a
              smoke/chat/fish on the Yishun-bound side of Yishun Dam. The double
              yellow lines are there for a reason.</p>
              <p>And finally a proper basic day bus service for the looong, big
              and empty bus stop outside KTPH.</p>
              <p>In fact when the direct TPE &lt;-&gt; Seletar West Link
              interchange is complete, we might see one or some of 39/85/965/969
              using that way instead of Lentor-&gt;SLE, since the Lentor-SLE-TPE
              stretch serves nobody until Jln Kayu roundabout/Punggol except
              folks staying at Springside/Springleaf who fancy a walk along the
              Sg. Seletar river to the bus stops at Lentor.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right... loading on 85/853 can be expected to drop as 103 will be quicker. Anyway 85 loading already quite low.. lets see how 103 further affects it.</p>
              <p>I dont think 39/965/969 will be diverted as of now. Diverting 85 does not make sense also. </p>

              <p>I don't think that the loads of 85 will drop a lot as only a
              handful of bus stops are duplicated with the new route.</p>
              <p>I would think that 854 will be affected more as this extended

              industrial estate, Buangkok areas, and Greenwich V.</p>
              <p>Mainly because it will be faster than 854 which plies along
              Lentor Ave which is a heavily utilised road, and will provide a
              service to the above mentioned places for Yishun East residents,
              without the need to go to Yishun Interchange. </p>
              <p>As for 85, I think it may be diverted to Sengkang West Road in

              <p>103 loading should be quite good. The route is what most of us wanted. I think to some extent LTA might be peeping into this forum for suggestions also. This was suggestion repeated and makes lot of sense from LTA point of view aslo.</p>
              <p>Can call it as new service yet not major extension so still mid-haul extension for them.</p>
              <p>Route serves multiple purpose</p>
              <p>- connects Seletar Aerospace / industrial to Yishun MRT</p>
              <p>- alternate to 806 heavy loading sector. Also with 806 calling at additional stop along st 31... this move makes imminent sense... ave 11 residents needed another service. </p>
              <p>- connects Yishun east side to Seletar Circus / Jalan Kayu / YCK road / Serangoon without having to go to MRT/interchange and change.</p>

                                affect sbs 85. Basically serve different crowds of people. For sbs
                                85, the main crowd going yishun are from sengkang east and sengkang
                                west area. Cheers.</p>

              Svc 85 also serves foreign workers from Yishun to Jln Kayu (food courts etc). Although 85 may still faster than 103 (unless traffic jam, but they usually travel on weekends so should not be much of an issue), I feel they will just take whatever comes first.

              <p>854 can be slow during peak hours, especially the traffic along
              Lentor Ave and the crowds along Ang Mo Kio north industrial estate.
              And 854 is a very crowded service, so Yishun East residents would
              rather take 103 instead. </p>

              <p>Let's see. I don't think 854 loading will take a beating. 103 loading though will be quite good as well. 85 loading already poor.. so no question of taking beating...</p>

              <p>85's loading is good already. I do board 85 from Sengkang to Yishun or from Jalan Kayu to Yishun. Passenger load is good. Just that 103 will help ease loads frm Jalan Kayu to Yishun though applying different sector before meeting service 85 at Yishun Ave 2.</p>

              <p>The routing via Senja road makes absolute sense. For those from BPJ Interchange can take 922 and there will be no increase in commute time. I highlighted this need few months back saying Senja needs a trunk service, and definitely one more service in addition to 920. </p>
              <p>Good to see 972 being diverted via Senja road. 972 DDs already have 80-90 pax when it gets on to PIE. I suspect another 2 BSEP DDs will be added to 972 making it fleet of 17 buses to cater to increased demand. 972 will also be an intra-town within the whole ring road township.</p>
              <p>Once DTL2 starts, 972 will also provide good alternative to Senja residents to connect to BPJ MRT. Good move once it happens!!</p>
