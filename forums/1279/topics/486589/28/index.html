              <p>Yes... gone from their websites as well... so it cannot be " by
              mistake " deletion. I think they realized some of their stupidity
              in route planning. Hopefully they make appropriate change but its
              only 5 days before they launch, so they better be quick.</p>
              <p>On another note, if they have taken commuters remarks seriously
              (as many bashed LTA for stupid route planning), I welcome that LTA
              is willing to hear us and make appropriate ammends. Lets see what
              comes out.</p>

              <p>Having said that, I hope they push back 983 till 2016 and let heavier 300G/W fleet and new 301 to get use to the compact interchange...</p>
              <p>I think this is appropriate so that in a yr time when 983 come in, another small arrangement can be done and not 1 time good one impact on the same day causing chaos...</p>

              <p>I don't think residents would complain about having "redundant bus services" with an extra svc 983. If anything, it would maintain the important connection between schs at Ave 4 and flats at Ave 5. More likely the "new concerns" are regarding loss of other intra-town connections.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at the changes in connectivity with the proposed route changes:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Existing svc 300</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 5 - Ave 2/3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Amended svc 300G/W</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 3 (only for 300W) - Ave 2 </p>
              <p>New svc 301</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 3 - Ave 5</p>
              <p>New svc 983</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 5</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the proposed changes, the following direct connections are lost:</p>
              <p>1. Ave 4 - Ave 3 (full stretch)</p>
              <p>2. Ave 5 - Ave 2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Ave 4 - Ave 3 connection is needed for students at BP Govt high or Concord Pri (Ave 4) living at Ave 3, mainly for those on the other side of Ave 3 further from Ave 4, although they can also walk to Ave 2 to take 300G/W.</p>
              <p>The Ave 5 - Ave 2 connection is needed for students at CCK Pri (Ave 2) living at Ave 5, and maybe for Ave 5 residents heading to Keat Hong Shopping Centre, although they can also walk to Ave 1 to take 172 to Ave 3, then walk in to Ave 5.</p>
              <p>For both cases, pax can make a one way connection by transferring at the bus stop in front of Sunshine Plaza, along Ave 3. (975/301 -&gt; 300W for Ave 3 to Ave 4, and 300W -&gt; 301 for Ave 2 to Ave 5) Currently, there is only one bus stop in front of Sunshine Plaza with no bus stop opposite due to lack of space, with an Esso petrol station in the middle of that stretch of road.</p>
              <p>A possible solution is to have a single, wider road leading into the petrol station for both entry and exit, instead of entry and exit points at both ends of the petrol station. A bus stop can then be placed at the longer stretch of pavement which includes the closed entry/exit point. The traffic flow within the petrol station would also need to be reconfigured to allow vehicles to turn back to exit. With a bus stop there, pax can make transfers in the opposite direction as well, and also improving connections to that area with an extra bus stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the route changes postponed just a few days before implementation, and after the official announcement has been made, this tells us how difficult it is to reroute bus services to improve efficiency, at the cost of reducing the number of direct connections provided. Also shows how powerful the grassroots advisors are in having a say on such matters.</p>

              <p>Okay good to see they at least put this up. But postponed by 2 months. wow. I think they did realize there was too much duplication and I think this time around people were more vocal because they are tired with the kind of routes LTA is launching. They are really bad. I hope they also realize this. </p>
              <p>They better have better routes since its a 2 month delay and not minor changes.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I don't think residents would complain about having "redundant
                              bus services" with an extra svc 983. If anything, it would maintain
                              the important connection between schs at Ave 4 and flats at Ave 5.
                              More likely the "new concerns" are regarding loss of other
                              intra-town connections.</p>
              <p>Let's take a look at the changes in connectivity with the
                              proposed route changes:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Existing svc 300</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 5 - Ave 2/3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Amended svc 300G/W</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 3 (only for 300W) - Ave 2 </p>
              <p>New svc 301</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 3 - Ave 5</p>
              <p>New svc 983</p>
              <p>CCK Int/MRT - Ave 4 - Ave 5</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the proposed changes, the following direct connections are
                              lost:</p>
              <p>1. Ave 4 - Ave 3 (full stretch)</p>
              <p>2. Ave 5 - Ave 2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Ave 4 - Ave 3 connection is needed for students at BP Govt
                              high or Concord Pri (Ave 4) living at Ave 3, mainly for those on
                              the other side of Ave 3 further from Ave 4, although they can also
                              walk to Ave 2 to take 300G/W.</p>
              <p>The Ave 5 - Ave 2 connection is needed for students at CCK Pri
                              (Ave 2) living at Ave 5, and maybe for Ave 5 residents heading to
                              Keat Hong Shopping Centre, although they can also walk to Ave 1 to
                              take 172 to Ave 3, then walk in to Ave 5.</p>
              <p>For both cases, pax can make a one way connection by
                              transferring at the bus stop in front of Sunshine Plaza, along Ave
                              3. (975/301 -&gt; 300W for Ave 3 to Ave 4, and 300W -&gt; 301 for
                              Ave 2 to Ave 5) Currently, there is only one bus stop in front of
                              Sunshine Plaza with no bus stop opposite due to lack of space, with
                              an Esso petrol station in the middle of that stretch of road.</p>
              <p>A possible solution is to have a single, wider road leading into
                              the petrol station for both entry and exit, instead of entry and
                              exit points at both ends of the petrol station. A bus stop can then
                              be placed at the longer stretch of pavement which includes the
                              closed entry/exit point. The traffic flow within the petrol station
                              would also need to be reconfigured to allow vehicles to turn back
                              to exit. With a bus stop there, pax can make transfers in the
                              opposite direction as well, and also improving connections to that
                              area with an extra bus stop.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the route changes postponed just a few days before
                              implementation, and after the official announcement has been made,
                              this tells us how difficult it is to reroute bus services to
                              improve efficiency, at the cost of reducing the number of direct
                              connections provided. Also shows how powerful the grassroots
                              advisors are in having a say on such matters.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi mr 201911, this goes to show just 1 big issue. Once the direct connection (ave 4-ave 3 full stretch, ave 5-ave 2) is there already, it is not easy to go destroy or substitute that direct connection by any other half-hearted efforts. The same goes for the route services and directions in other estates. Once it is there, any efforts to deviate from it is bound to receive strong oppositions especially from those who are directly affected. </p>
              <p>Only route extensions, new routes are welcome with both hands. For those partially amended routes, alternative direct bus services must be given. That is why when I see those route suggestions in other topics like cutting short smrt 858 route with no viable direct alternative given, I know it is definitely not possible. Take note asking many people to transfer is deemed not viable. Cheers</p>

              <p>i also do hope they will put YewTee into consideration (adding a city direct service is a good start).</p>
              <p>which also shows Ave 4 residents are more proactive, it was also partly them that 300 keep getting fleet add from both SMRT and LTA</p>
              <p>and just to update from my previous post (although not impt now since the official post of the postpone is out), the notices at CCK INT are removed from the 300 berth...</p>

              <p>Current service amendment plans are cancelled</p>
              <p>there will be a new bus service 983 from CCK to Bt Batok via Bt
              Gombak from April 2015. Most likely 301 introduced as just a
              supplementary service and service 300 is retained.</p>

              <p>That will be a good move. One of the routes I was proposing. Today there is no connection to Bukit Gambok from CCK. I hope this service does st 32, st 31 and goes to Bukit Gambok mrt... and then plies east ave 5 to bukit batok.</p>
              <p>Lets see how the route is. </p>

              <p>Service 300G/W,301,983 are related, thus if one is not carried

              <p>What was the issue with 300G/W... I don't really get it... if at all, it was only going to help cck ave 2 residents... and with 983 and 301 there was no missing link.</p>
              <p>I think it is more than that... LTA must have gotten a lot of backlash with the way the routes were planned. See the LTA FB page.. almost everyone have written nasty comments. no one appreciated them introducing and making these changes.</p>
              <p>so that has made them wait and ponder if they are doing the right thing.</p>
              <p>by the way if 983 is not going to bukit panjang... then they will in future need another service to connect to dtl2. </p>
              <p>I think 300G/W and 301 was fine. Issue was with 983 route that got people agitated.</p>
