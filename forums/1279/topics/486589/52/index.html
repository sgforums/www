                  routes. More buses can start at depots instead of bus interchanges to 
                  prevent the addition of further load.</p>

              <p>With regards to 922, I would suggest having 972 ply Bangkit Rd to eliminate the need for 922 completely. Yes, a pair of stops along Bt Panjang Ring Rd would be affected since the Senja amendment and travel time would be slightly increased with an extra loop into Senja, but it would optimize limited bus resources and reduce redundancy, since 972 largely duplicates 922.</p>
              <p>I'll do some loading observation for 922 in a couple of days to better determine whether the above merger would be good.</p>
              <p>920 can be retained with its unique links along Saujana Rd for now.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs7557R, don't think of taking out smrt 922 without having an alternative replacement, ok? Bukit panjang ring Rd Blk 617 just lost SMRT 972 when it gets re-routed recently. Now left smrt 922 and smrt 971E(peak hours only). If you take out smrt 922 as well, then no more regular bus services left for this stop. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, yes optimization is good. But more necessary is to introduce new bus services to serve more areas. With so much population increase from the yr 2000s to 2010s, singapore did not keep up in pace with public transport for more than 10 years until BSEP kicks off in yr 2012. Population increase = increase in bus services. But our bus services are terribly loaded until the yr 2012 launch of BSEP. So should continue to increase new bus services until the population increase is tapered off. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

                                                  <p>I thank Mr dupdup77 for his online forum reply ('new areas leads to more bus services'; August 10).</p>
                                    
                                                  <p>While it is true that new bus services are required as new areas are developed, it is not the only reason for an increase in number of bus services.</p>
                                                  <p>New areas do not always equate to an overall increase in demand for bus services even as more bus services are launched, as a lower demand for bus services may be observed in the old areas due to shift in population to the new areas.</p>
                                                  <p>If the demand is too low in an area for the amount of bus services provided, resources would be adjusted, and this may lead to a smaller number of bus services there. The net demand for bus services has to increase for an increase in number of bus services.</p>

              <p>Yup, I did talk about the disadvantage of leaving the pair of bus stops outside Blk 617 &amp; Blk 537A CP unserved by any full day bus service in the earlier post. If 972 had not been amended into Senja Rd/Link, its merger with 922 to ply Bangkit Rd would have been more justified.</p>
              <p>I guess the point I want to make is that it is not very beneficial in running 922, which duplicates 972 extensively (along the first pair of Bt Panjang Ring Rd stops, Jelapang Rd, Segar Rd, Fajar Rd &amp; Bangkit LRT) just because of a few pair of bus stops not covered by 972. Therefore, if 922 gets withdrawn, the Bangkit Rd stops can be taken over by 972 to reduce inconvenience as far as possible. On the other hand, commuters using the skipped pair of stops can walk to the pair of bus stops nearby along Senja Link, or a new pair of stops can be erected along Jelapang Rd outside Blk 531 &amp; Blk 533 for the affected commuters.</p>
              <p>If the above suggestions are still not good enough, maybe the additional trunk service for Ring Rd that BusAnalayzer propose can serve the Blk 617 pair of stops, with 972 amended into Bangkit Rd, thus eliminating the need for 922. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I guess the point I want to make is that it is not very

                          Fajar Rd &amp; Bangkit LRT) just because of a few pair of bus stops
                          not covered by 972. Therefore, if 922 gets withdrawn, the Bangkit
                          Rd stops can be taken over by 972 to reduce inconvenience as far as
                          possible. On the other hand, commuters using the skipped pair of
                          stops can walk to the pair of bus stops nearby along Senja Link, or
                          a new pair of stops can be erected along Jelapang Rd outside Blk
                          531 &amp; Blk 533 for the affected commuters.</p>
              <p>If the above suggestions are still not good enough, maybe the
                          additional trunk service for Ring Rd that BusAnalayzer propose can
                          serve the Blk 617 pair of stops, with 972 amended into Bangkit Rd,
                          thus eliminating the need for 922. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS7557R, no point to fall back on history. Smrt 972 has already been re-routed into senja. So 100% will not merge with smrt 922 to ply Bangkit in this case already.</p>
              <p>Yes agree with you on smrt 922 on the initial point only. But NO to its withdrawal and asking smrt 972 to cover its Bangkit stops as well. Worse is to ask commuters to walk to the other side or erect new pair of stops as it will be too counterproductive. </p>
              <p>1 other bus service must cover the Blk 617 pair of stops or else don't ever think of removing smrt 922. Another potential uproar will definitely occur among residents if people always love to suggest to remove bus services without providing an alternative. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Overall, what we need, I believe, is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">optimization of resources</span>, not
              just simply introducing new services at these areas. Low-demand
              buses should be amended or even eliminated -- for example, at Bt
              Batok, 173, 178 and 990 could well be re-routed or split into more
              useful routes. More buses can start at depots instead of bus
              interchanges to prevent the addition of further load.</p>

              <p><br>91M no need... The industrial area there do not have much demand on Sundays/PHs. Whereas 92M has its catchment in Mt Sinai</p>

              <p>Ghim Moh Terminal is still far from Buona Vista MRT (both lines)... Actually would have been better if 200 could be extended to loop @ Mount Sinai, originating from Kent Ridge.. </p>
              <p>92 can be Ghim Moh / Science Park 1 service on weekdays. </p>
