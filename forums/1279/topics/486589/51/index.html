              <p><br> Actually, I don't think an 'M' variant can only call at the stops
              of its parent route and nothing else. 70M, 107M and 162M are some
              examples. 63M also has one stop different from 63 at MacPherson
              (where 63 is turning into Merpati Rd). 143M and 43M also have some
              bus stops which their parent services do not ply. Maybe you will
              say these services still use the same interchange/terminal as their
              parent route. But there is 17A which starts from BNDEP, and that's
              not a terminal for svc 17. Although 17A is technically not an 'M'
              varient, I would say it's operating in the same way as the 'M'
              varients. Another such example is 170X which starts from Kranji
              Station. If 17A can do this, I don't see a reason why 43M cannot
              start from Serangoon Int.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I am not sure if 17A allows boarding at BNDEP. If it allows, then you can use this logic for sbs 43M to start from serangoon interchange. If sbs 17A does not allow boarding ar BNDEP, then your logic is flawed for sbs 43M. </p>
              <p>You use sbs 170X which starts from Kranji. This is not a bus terminal or interchange. Sbs 170 also stops at this bus stop which is same as sbs 170X. So why you say sbs 170X as an example? This is treated as a bus stop which is same as parent service (sbs 170). Nothing unusual for a service to use part of route for parent service. How does it relate to sbs 43M starting from serangoon interchange which is not part of parent service??? Very ironical. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>If you think 43M cannot start from Serangoon Int JUST because it is not a part of its parent service, bear in mind that 70M, 107M, 162M also ply Suntec which is NOT a part of their parent service. Current 43M also calls at a stop along Upper Serangoon Road which is NOT a part of svc 43. 143M also calls at one bus stop along West Coast Rd which is NOT a part of svc 143. 53M even starts from Hougang St 21 Terminal which is NOT a part of svc 53. (Although you may argue that boarding/alighting is not allowed at Hougang St 21, there's no harm in making 43M enter Serangoon Int and do now allow boarding/alighting there as well. It's first stop can be along Serangoon Ctrl.)</p>
              <p>I can understand you want 43M to start from Punggol because that's the only service at Soo Teck. But 43 is also one of the only 2 services at Buangkok MRT (the other service 27 does not help), and the ONLY service for the bus stop at Buangkok Drive. At least Soo Teck has LRT as an alternative, but Buangkok Dr has nothing. </p>
              <p>I once took 43 during peak hours to see how it's loading is like. (I did not post my loading analysis as I believe Mr BusAnalyzer has taken 43/43M for many more times than me.) 20+ pax boarded at Punggol Int and around 12 alighted at Soo Teck. Then 60+ pax boarded at Buangkok MRT. 27 alighted at Buangkok Dr (which is one stop away), and most of the rest alighted at Buangkok Green. Can you still say Punggol needs 43M more? If that's the case, why didn't I see higher loading along the Punggol-Buangkok stretch?</p>
              <p>Yes I know that NEX has many other services, but the fact that 43/43M still survives with high loading shows that 43M is (maybe the only) service preferred by Buangkok Green residents who transfer to bus at NEX. It's hard to say they need 43/43M less than Punggol residents.</p>

              <p>TBH I feel 53M should allow boarding/alighting at Hougang St 21 so that those waiting for svc 113 there have another alternative. Maybe in the direction towards Hougang St 21, it can use Upp Serangoon Rd to Kovan MRT so that those who want to go to Kovan MRT can also take 53M during AM peak instead of only having svc 113.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, Good point for the M series. Good analysis. Take note you have already counted sbs 53M out since it does not allow boarding/alighting at the terminal/interchange.</p>
              <p>For the loading analysis, what we observe may exemplify a daily occurrence and can be used to represent a general view.</p>
              <p>However, please take note that sometimes other factors are more crucial than others (including loading) when introducing a new M service. Factors like lack of linkage are very important. It does not mean that loading is more at certain sectors than others then they re-route to benefit more people. So your loading analysis does not really mean much in certain cases. </p>
              <p>By the way, your last paragraph is inconsequential right? Currently Buangkok green residents still have Sbs 43M. So both buangkok green and Punggol residents still have SBS 43M. If you route from serangoon to buangkok green, then Punggol residents don't have Sbs 43M. So now currently this route benefit both. So why need change from serangoon to buangkok green only? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>A trunk to Bt Panjang will benefit Yew Tee residents better considering the crowd at CCK, thus my earlier suggestion of <strong><a title="Extend 177" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=79#post_11095787">extending 177</a></strong> to Yew Tee via Woodlands Rd &amp; KJE (as the BTP ITH won't be ready by DTL2 opening).</p>
              <p>Bt Gombak isn't in dire need of feeders yet, there's 187 / 188 / 947 / 985 to help with the load at West Ave 4, and 945 / MRT at West Ave 5. If a direct connection is in demand, consider <strong><a href="/forums/1279/topics/486589?page=37#post_11074870">amending 947</a></strong> to serve Bt Gombak MRT then. The upcoming West Ave 8 area, though, can have one good feeder / trunk service.</p>
