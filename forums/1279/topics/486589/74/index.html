              <p>Don't want to sound boastful... but I think LTA does refer this
              forum.. In recent past, so many of my proposed routes have come out
              90%-100% true.</p>
              <p>382G/W - I had proposed is exactly similar <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>118 is 90% similar I would say because after Punggol West, I did
              make it do  Punggol Field/Punggol road before touching
              TPE <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">979 also 90% similar to what I
              proposed, except for the fact I thought it will do Stagmont and
              then connect CCK North 5. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>I feel that the LTA has a guiding principle when planning bus routes, which is that the bus service must take the fastest route to connect all the places it is created to serve.</p>
                              <p>The other principle is that, as much as possible, there must not be loss of bus connection in existing bus services. In fact, as much as possible, do not mess with the route of existing bus services. If there is loss, a new bus service must compensate back the loss. The case of Bus Services 300, 301 and 983 is a good example.</p>
                          <p>If we also apply the same principles, especially the first one on fastest possible route, we can roughly know how the route would be. My guess on bus services 382G/W was really close (it is damn obvious anyway). Maybe they decide to let it ply Sentul Crescent because that way is faster?</p>
                              <p>I used to think that the LTA has restrictions in route length, that the route must not exceed a certain length for it to be in a category (e.g. trunk). After I found out about the length of bus service 47 and the extended bus service 49, I have a feeling that there may after all be no restriction in route length. Maybe the restriction is on the travel time instead.</p>
                          <p>Nonetheless, I think feeder routes have restrictions in length. I guess only feeder route have such restrictions.</p>

              <p>I think array has given enough examples below to show LTA does not always go for direct route. Their planners have done a bad job with some of the initial route planning, and I am sure they see the data now and realize.</p>
              <p>What they can't do is go back and modify as that will show them as "bad" and have to explain. So at least in the recent lot of services introduced, they have taken time, but their introductions in 2015 have been more sensible than before. I feel thay are not just looking here for feedback, but also from our route suggestion emails to them (which I do, even others must be) and more ground work from their side.</p>
              <p>2014 was pathetic in the way they launched resource draining PPSS and some stupid M variants and other not so useful services.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, for 382G/W, I support LTA decision in using Punggol field (west side) rather than Punggol central (west side). Punggol field (west side) only has Sbs 119 at doorstep. Punggol central (west side) has Sbs 43, 43M, 117, 118 at doorstep. So it is good decision. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Actually, what I wanted to do is to try to find out how the LTA plan bus routes. In this forum, many feedback are made in response to observations and experiences. The people working at LTA office are university graduates, who probably major in the field of Human Geography. In addition, they are able to determine the demands for a new bus route and the impact in demand on existing transport routes. I feel that it would be good if we know the general characteristics of the bus routes planned by the LTA, so that we can recommend better bus routes.</p>

                              <p>but, Geography very hard. :(</p>
                              <p>Anyway, just now I say wrongly. I do not think it is geography that the route planners are major in. I think it is business. Because they are dealing with resources, and all these cost money. They have to ensure that the bus service they create are profitable, or at least have a certain amount of demand so that the loss can be as mininal as possible and can be recovered from other bus services.</p>
                          <p>by the way, I put girl profile picture... why you still refer to me as "Mr"? ;)</p>
                      <p>Anyway, don't worry about me la. At Polytechnic, I am studying modules about business and engineering. Even if I cannot make it (ask to leave), I will probably attend private school or something. Somemore now got this skills future scheme by the Government (Recession is coming, Government send us to school to upgrade), where I can go to school learn and work on the MRT... Actually, to enter the transport industry is easy. To work in the LTA also easy. But to really go up there, it is very hard, and it takes time to climb up the ladder.</p>
