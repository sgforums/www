              <p>Sort of expected, especially with that two new bus stops springing up at Yishun Ave 8.</p>
              <p>Good and sensible move. May mean even less pax for 85.... and 853 as well. Pax wanting to go Yishun from Serangoon Central may take 103 - possibly faster as well since it avoids AMK and the jam-prone Lentor, not to mention the long wait for 853. Kudos for having another SBST service in Yishun.</p>
              <p>Folks should now REALLY avoid stopping their cars for a smoke/chat/fish on the Yishun-bound side of Yishun Dam. The double yellow lines are there for a reason.</p>
              <p>And finally a proper basic day bus service for the looong, big and empty bus stop outside KTPH.</p>
              <p>In fact when the direct TPE &lt;-&gt; Seletar West Link interchange is complete, we might see one or some of 39/85/965/969 using that way instead of Lentor-&gt;SLE, since the Lentor-SLE-TPE stretch serves nobody until Jln Kayu roundabout/Punggol except folks staying at Springside/Springleaf who fancy a walk along the Sg.

              <p>Hi mr antidennislance, this is good move. Don't think will affect sbs 85. Basically serve different crowds of people. For sbs 85, the main crowd going yishun are from sengkang east and sengkang west area. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Is there really a height limitation at Seletar Airport area?? If
                  103 gets extended, it is a good move. Expect 85 loading to drop

              <p>I don't think that the loads of 85 will drop a lot as only a handful of bus stops are duplicated with the new route.</p>
              <p>I would think that 854 will be affected more as this extended 103 will provide a direct link from Yishun to Serangoon North industrial estate, Buangkok areas, and Greenwich V.</p>
              <p>Mainly because it will be faster than 854 which plies along Lentor Ave which is a heavily utilised road, and will provide a service to the above mentioned places for Yishun East residents, without the need to go to Yishun Interchange. </p>
              <p>As for 85, I think it may be diverted to Sengkang West Road in future.  </p>

              <p>Yes 854 will still see good loading, the Jln Eunos &lt;-&gt; Hougang stretch is still very much relevant. As is the AMK/YCK industrial area.</p>
              <p>Bendies probably only for feeders, if at all.</p>
              <p>There's already speculations about a 807, though I have no idea if that is substantial. </p>
              <p>Extension of 85 would be a good idea. Or 39/965 to go thru Ave 1 / Seletar West Link from Yishun East instead of hitting Lentor/TPE directly. Perhaps 965 can even go through Seletar North Link to hit Punggol directly without even hitting TPE and ending directly at Sengkang across the bridge,</p>

              <p>Sort of expected, especially with that two new bus stops springing up at Yishun Ave 8.</p>
              <p>Good and sensible move. May mean even less pax for 85.... and 853 as well. Pax wanting to go Yishun from Serangoon Central may take 103 - possibly faster as well since it avoids AMK and the jam-prone Lentor, not to mention the long wait for 853. Kudos for having another SBST service in Yishun.</p>
              <p>Folks should now REALLY avoid stopping their cars for a smoke/chat/fish on the Yishun-bound side of Yishun Dam. The double yellow lines are there for a reason.</p>
              <p>And finally a proper basic day bus service for the looong, big and empty bus stop outside KTPH.</p>
              <p>In fact when the direct TPE &lt;-&gt; Seletar West Link interchange is complete, we might see one or some of 39/85/965/969 using that way instead of Lentor-&gt;SLE, since the Lentor-SLE-TPE stretch serves nobody until Jln Kayu roundabout/Punggol except folks staying at Springside/Springleaf who fancy a walk along the Sg.
