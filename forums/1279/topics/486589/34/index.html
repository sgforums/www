              <p>Sv 34 has a more extensive coverage of Tampines area than Sv
                      27.<br> <br> I noticed that if 27 were to go directly to CGA from Sengkang:</p>
              <p>Residents boarding Sv 27 along Tampines Ave 9 can walk the other
                      side to Tampines Ave 5 to board Sv 34. Current HDB blocks in that
                      area are sandwiched between Ave 5 and Ave 9.<br> <br> For Tampines Central itself, People boarding Sv. 27 along Tampine
                      Ave 4 can walk the other side to catch Sv. 34 from Tampines ave
                      5. <br> <br> The other sectors of Tampines are only served by Sv 34 only
                      anyway.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I am wrong. Its just a suggestion. But a 27/27M
                      solution is what I would suggest. The 27/47 suggestion I said is of
                      course more drastic.</p>
              <p>For Service 858, I do agree of the high loadings to airport from
                      northern Singapore but as a resident in Sengkang, I still choose to
                      take 858 from TPE instead of taking 27 through tampines even if I
                      have to squeeze (but I know this will not be everybody's
                      preference). If frequency is increased, maybe it could help reduce
                      crowds when the bus arrives at Sengkang? Its a pity that 858 cannot
                      use high capacity buses really. I always hoped CGA would do
                      something to make the PTB turns wider so that a bendy could pass
                      through but it has never happened. DDs wise, I guess thats more far
                      fetched because the height restrictions will be far harder to
                      modify</p>

              <p>Hi mr randomguy10, you really cannot expect all residents to walk from tampines Ave 9 to tampines Ave 5 just to hop on to sbs 34 to CGA. Same as for all tampines Ave 4 residents to go ave 5 to hop on to sbs 34 to CGA. </p>
              <p>Firstly, sbs 34 no capacity to handle such high demand in increase. Secondly, tampines being such a big area and estate near to airport only has sbs 34 to go CGA??? Thirdly, why is there a need to have sbs 27 skip tampines?  Fourthly, sbs 27 has a more direct route than sbs 34 in going to CGA. Fifthly, tampines ave 9 residents lose a direct bus service to other northeast area (Sengkang, buangkok and Hougang) previously served by sbs 27. How will that go down well with ave 9 residents?</p>
              <p>Everybody thinks smrt858 is the fastest to airport from TPE stop. This fact I cannot deny.</p>
              <p>smrt858 &gt; sbs 27 &gt; sbs 34</p>
              <p>18 min &gt; 27 min &gt; 34 min</p>
              <p>but if frequency is taken into account, </p>
              <p>sbs 27 &gt; smrt858 &gt; sbs 34</p>
              <p>the frequency of Sbs 27 makes traveling to CGA faster than smrt858 from TPE stop if you take waiting time into consideration.</p>
              <p>i have tried so many times and you can also try that. </p>
              <p>So not necessarily you transfer to smrt 858 at TPE stop, you will be faster than you carry on your journey with sbs 27. For your info, sbs 27 only bypasses few roads in tampines unlike sbs 34. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Yeah you are right. Tampines definitely needs more than one bus service to the airport if not loading on 34 will explode. So Ill keep to the 27/27M suggestion with a majority DD fleet serving 27M. In fact there is no need for 27 to skip tampines because people who want a direct CGA access from sengkang still take 27 all the way instead of transferring to 858.</p>
              <p>But in my suggestion, the tampines ave 9 residents will not lose a link to the north east areas. The service 47 I suggested is exactly 27M just that I put it as a different number because 27M will no longer fit if 27 skips tampines because the route is not complimentary anymore.</p>

              <p>u can not think of elimination of 27 in tamp. bus so heavy used. unless u provide replacement service how 201 replace 189. 27 have huge crowd to north east. 27 load to cga okay. 34 i agree ur point. no space to take more peop. that y i so excite to know 164 come from pgl to tamp. but false alarm.</p>

              <p>You cannot just remove the Tampines sector... You need another
              service to complement it if 27 to CGA bypasses Tampines... Also, a
              lot of sv 72 pax alight along Tampines ave 9.. I wouldn't say that
              people prefer 27/168 to ave 9, because with 5-7 min frequency on sv
              72 from Tampines, a lot of people do take this one as
              well. </p>
              <p>I think "A" and "M" might be operated differently. M services
              have dedicated buses while A services are drawn from parent
              service. So definitely possible for 27M to get DDs. </p>

              <p>Well, you do made a point, since pax boarding from Ave 4 have a lesser chance of baording the bus, compared to boarding Svc 72 from Int. But between a choice of an average of 3 buses to (try to) board, and a bus with a high chance of boarding within the same time span, I would have a hard time to choose TBH. (168's PM freq is decently high)</p>
              <p>Technically, 27M existed unofficially.... in the form of SWT 27A and Svc 27 downruns from CS.</p>

              <p>To add on, no point adding buses to Svc 858, if it have a high chance of ending up like Svc 966. Also have to agree with the need of 2 services in Tampines to serve CGA.

              <p>858 will be like 966 bunching everytime, but it is needed cos of the load and route... Like wkends, 858 can have 2 or 3 buses bunching at CGA with all full load... No joke... The queue is worst than 24/27/34//36/53...</p>

              <p>Jurong Lake District - I see the need for bus service along Corporation Rd where right now only sv 178 plies and covered by 79 for few stops. There are new BTOs coming up here, so I suspect there will be a feeder service connecting this road to Lakeside MRT. Might start from Taman Jurong Terminal.</p>

              <p>858 will be like 966 bunching everytime, but it is needed cos of
              the load and route... Like wkends, 858 can have 2 or 3 buses
              bunching at CGA with all full load... No joke... The queue is worst
              than 24/27/34//36/53...</p>

              <p>actually, for Taman Jurong, I have a feeling that there will
              soon be at least one City Direct bus service. Why? Because of every
              area in Jurong West, Taman Jurong (and Boon Lay) is the only one of
              two that still do not have City Direct bus service. </p>
              <p>If routed correctly, City Direct bus services at Taman Jurong
              would relieve many trunk and feeder bus services there. Likewise at
              Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I hope there can be new express bus services in
              Jurong that connects to other towns. Some short-term (replaced when
              CRL or JRL opens), some permanent (MRT will never 100% replace
              buses, in my opinion). </p>
              <p>Actually, personally, in my opinion, I feel that express bus
              services is the way to go to cater to the increase in loading on
              public transportation. Hopefully, the authorities can really look
              into the idea of having express bus services.</p>
