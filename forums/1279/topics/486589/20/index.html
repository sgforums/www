              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since LTA has been introducing many new M svcs/ full day SWTs lately, do you think we'll see more of them this quarter? Personally, I think it's a good way to improve freq. on sectors with heavier loading without having to add buses on the whole route.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">May have been suggested before, but here's my take on possible svcs with M variants:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">27M: Sengkang - Tampines (can deploy DDs)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">36M: Marine Parade - Tomlinson Rd (can deploy DDs)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">53M/113M: Kovan - Lor Ah Soo - Serangoon (combine 53A/B and 113A, can also be introduced as a new svc with a diff. number altogether)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">121M: Tiong Bahru MRT - Kim Tian Rd - Lower Delta Rd (return to Tiong Bahru via Lower Delta Rd express. have observed high full day loading at this sector, as Kim Tian residents prefer taking bus since now there's an option, while bus is much emptier towards Telok Blangah. may be introduced as peak hour SWT 121A first)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">172M: CCK - KJE/PIE (express) - Boon Lay (faster connection between CCK and Boon Lay by skipping Old CCK Rd/Jln Bahar, which has heavy boarding/alighting during peak hrs, slowing down the journey for pax between CCK and Boon Lay. I suggested a similar route before via KJE/PIE, but it was a new route between Bt Panjang and Joo Koon.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since 189 was recently split into 189 (loop @ Clementi) and 201, I believe we could possibly see similar amendments in future to separate sectors with different loading patterns into different svcs, the question is when and how.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One possible svc to be split is 858. Much inter/intra town travel in Yishun, Sembawang &amp; Woodlands, but also provides fast, direct connection between CGA/ Northeast (via TPE &amp; Jln kayu stops) and North areas. I believe the route can be split as such:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">858: Yishun - CGA</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">968: Woodlands - Yishun MRT/Ave 2/Khatib MRT - Yishun Ave 1 (express) - Upp Thomson Rd - Yio Chu Kang Rd - Yio Chu Kang MRT/Int</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Although this will inconvenience pax travelling between CGA/Northeast and Sembawang/Woodlands, those from Sembawang/Woodlands can transfer from 968 to 858 along Yishun Ave 2. 968's sector from Khatib to YCK was suggested previously by other users in the route suggestions thread as part of another svc, which would provide better connectivity to Upp Thomson/Tagore/YCK Rd.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The amended 858 would be less prone to bunching with a shorter route that mostly uses the expressway, and shorter sector in residential area with slower, more unpredictable traffic. The existing route's high loading sector between Woodlands and Yishun, as new svc 968, can get high capacity buses which cannot be deployed now due to CGA height restrictions.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">May have been suggested before, but here's my take on possible svcs
              with M variants:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">27M: Sengkang - Tampines (can deploy DDs)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">36M: Marine Parade - Tomlinson Rd (can deploy DDs)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">53M/113M: Kovan - Lor Ah Soo - Serangoon (combine 53A/B and 113A,
              can also be introduced as a new svc with a diff. number
              altogether)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">121M: Tiong Bahru MRT - Kim Tian Rd - Lower Delta Rd (return to
              Tiong Bahru via Lower Delta Rd express. have observed high full day
              loading at this sector, as Kim Tian residents prefer taking bus
              since now there's an option, while bus is much emptier towards
              Telok Blangah. may be introduced as peak hour SWT 121A first)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">172M: CCK - KJE/PIE (express) - Boon Lay (faster connection between
              CCK and Boon Lay by skipping Old CCK Rd/Jln Bahar, which has heavy
              boarding/alighting during peak hrs, slowing down the journey for
              pax between CCK and Boon Lay. I suggested a similar route before
              via KJE/PIE, but it was a new route between Bt Panjang and Joo
              Koon.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since 189 was recently split into 189 (loop @ Clementi) and 201, I
              believe we could possibly see similar amendments in future to
              separate sectors with different loading patterns into different
              svcs, the question is when and how.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One possible svc to be split is 858. Much inter/intra town travel
              in Yishun, Sembawang &amp; Woodlands, but also provides fast,
              direct connection between CGA/ Northeast (via TPE &amp; Jln kayu
              stops) and North areas. I believe the route can be split as
              such:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">858: Yishun - CGA</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">968: Woodlands - Yishun MRT/Ave 2/Khatib MRT - Yishun Ave 1
              (express) - Upp Thomson Rd - Yio Chu Kang Rd - Yio Chu Kang
              MRT/Int</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Although this will inconvenience pax travelling between
              CGA/Northeast and Sembawang/Woodlands, those from
              Sembawang/Woodlands can transfer from 968 to 858 along Yishun Ave
              2. 968's sector from Khatib to YCK was suggested previously by
              other users in the route suggestions thread as part of another svc,
              which would provide better connectivity to Upp Thomson/Tagore/YCK
              Rd.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The amended 858 would be less prone to bunching with a shorter
              route that mostly uses the expressway, and shorter sector in
              residential area with slower, more unpredictable traffic. The
              existing route's high loading sector between Woodlands and Yishun,
              as new svc 968, can get high capacity buses which cannot be
              deployed now due to CGA height restrictions.</p>

              <p>My inputs on your M service, if you may like.</p>
              <p>27M: strongly support, and have been recommending this for quite some time. Can also be introduced as new service. Currently, sv 27A operates at frequency of 05-06 mins in AM peak and similar downroutes during PM peak. It would be beneficial if this comes as a new service under BSEP with DDs and a bit different routing within Tampines. </p>
              <p>36M: I think sv 36 is doing okay for now. It was really bad but with buses added, somehow the service is now managing load ok. </p>
              <p>53M: Yes, my earlier suggestion was extend 113 to Serangoon and operate 113M between Serangoon and Kovan, scrapping 53A/B and 45A</p>
              <p>121M: Not yet needed IMO. Service is doing well and is managing load okay. Actually 121 has loading only b/w Tiong Bahru and Tehlok Blangah. The route b/w TB Plaza and New Bridge hardly has commuters but I think they needed service to start somewhere, that's why the route.</p>
              <p>172M: Like your suggestion here. Can also be introduced as new service. 172 for now needs more bendies or at least introduce DDs. One of the several poorly managed services by SMRT</p>

              <p>I like your suggestion on splitting 858. I am not sure though how Woodlands people will receive it as it will cut off their connection to Jalan Kayu, TPE stop and CGA. </p>
              <p>858 could still start from Woodlands and work as parallel to MRT, with stops at Admiralty, Sembawang, Yishun and Khatib and then Jalan Kayu, TPE and CGA</p>
              <p>The service you propose 968 can stop everywhere along the olf 858 route and then follow its way to YCK or better still Bishan to also get connected to CCL. </p>

                  via KJE/PIE, but it was a new route between Bt Panjang and Joo
                  Koon.)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Since 189 was recently split into 189 (loop @ Clementi) and 201, I
                  believe we could possibly see similar amendments in future to
                  separate sectors with different loading patterns into different
                  svcs, the question is when and how.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">One possible svc to be split is 858. Much inter/intra town travel
                  in Yishun, Sembawang &amp; Woodlands, but also provides fast,
                  direct connection between CGA/ Northeast (via TPE &amp; Jln kayu
                  stops) and North areas. I believe the route can be split as
                  such:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">858: Yishun - CGA</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">968: Woodlands - Yishun MRT/Ave 2/Khatib MRT - Yishun Ave 1
                  (express) - Upp Thomson Rd - Yio Chu Kang Rd - Yio Chu Kang
                  MRT/Int</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Although this will inconvenience pax travelling between
                  CGA/Northeast and Sembawang/Woodlands, those from
                  Sembawang/Woodlands can transfer from 968 to 858 along Yishun Ave
                  2. 968's sector from Khatib to YCK was suggested previously by
                  other users in the route suggestions thread as part of another svc,
                  which would provide better connectivity to Upp Thomson/Tagore/YCK
                  Rd.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The amended 858 would be less prone to bunching with a shorter
                  route that mostly uses the expressway, and shorter sector in
                  residential area with slower, more unpredictable traffic. The
                  existing route's high loading sector between Woodlands and Yishun,
                  as new svc 968, can get high capacity buses which cannot be
                  deployed now due to CGA height restrictions.</p>

              <p>Hi mr 201911, smrt 858 new route will not work. Lost the direct connection between woodlands and CGA. And worse, there is no other direct alternative. Lots of people will complain and with the heavy patronage at yishun side, there will be damn heavy congestion if ask everybody to transfer. Certainly this is not the way to be.</p>
              <p>smrt 858 purpose is to give some of the roads in woodlands, admiralty, sembawang, yishun a direct link to CGA. By just cutting it short to yishun in order to alleviate the bunching is not deemed a solution. It will definitely inconvenience many people. Thanks.</p>

              <p>All, good news. Expect the Punggol new service to be announced very soon. Hip hip hooray. Route should be Punggol bus int-&gt; Punggol place-&gt; punggol drive-&gt; edgedale plains (opp horizon primary school and greendale primary school) -&gt; punggol field (outside punggol plaza) -&gt; then either to other estates or 1 round to Punggol east, punggol central and back to bus int.

              <p>The bus stop at edgedale plains (opposite horizon primary school) is almost ready except for shelter. The next bus stop at edgedale plains (at greendale primary school) is currently being built and the bus stop area is being cordoned off. There is currently no bus service at this edgedale plains although the HDB flats there have been up for 10 yrs.</p>
              <p>I also saw many single deck buses with bus drivers training for this route for a few hours this afternoon. 3 cheers to another bus service for this part of punggol. At this moment, should be another feeder service. Hooray!</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser. Haha. I think you have short memories. I reply that there was a feeder and a trunk service. I even mentioned the route that it will go to edgedale plains and deep into edgedale plains and come out Punggol drive turn right to Punggol east and one loop back to Punggol central and towards bus int/mrt. I even say that it may be 50-50 between CCK and Punggol to have the 2nd service. You even acknowledge it. Haha. Poor memories you have!</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you are in the wrong and you still dare to write all these. No wonder I am right that the admin should ban you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I bring good news to all and you thought I am arrogant and a bully. This is already dunno the how many times you get so agitated and want to pick up a quarrel over such small issues. I was merely overjoyed on seeing bus stops that I let others know that my opinion that it came to this part of Punggol is correct. That's all. I am not going to earn millions of dollars over this announcement so why should I be arrogant and a bully? Such childish thinking you have!</p>
              <p>Secondly, you ask me for my opinion and you choose to either write rubbish or feign ignorance. Go read the post I replied you on 11 jan inside the thread on sengkang/tampines bus expansion. You are really a nonsensical shit person. You really owed all the people in this forum an apology for being shit and twist facts. I copy down for all to see what I write initially. Damn rubbish nonsense. I am a down to right person and I am never a bully. So after everybody reads this before, let's get it clear. Mr busanalyser is really an idiot.</p>

              <p>Okay. You mentioned that you expect a feeder and trunk service to be introduced in Punggol in Q1. What is your prediction?</p>
              <p>I think feeder is not possible. where in Punggol do you see need of feeder at this moment? The flats at Matilda, Sumang west not ready yet to warrant feeder. The flats at Nibong have LRT. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you really deserve a tight slap on your face. You are one who cannot control your emotions. You always like to come here to show your outburst. You simply cannot accept the facts that others know something earlier than you. There is nothing to be so proud of. Please be humble and don't assume others are trying to show off. We all know you as one guy who has immense knowledge and this forum is for people to share facts and new findings. Certainly not for people like you to think of this forum as a place where you rule all. Cheers.</p>
