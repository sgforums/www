              <p>Hi mr sbst191, sbs 119 is an important service in Punggol and sengkang. At various roads, it is one of only few services plying there. At some roads, it is the only bus service. Why people think is not important or redundant is because the DDs make the bus look empty at times. However, there is sufficient loading for single deck. Furthermore, the frequency is 15 mins at times. Please note sbs 119 is not a completely new BSEP service. The BSEP for sbs 119 is only from sengkang int extended to Punggol int. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Oh LTA just introduces 2 new services (sbs 41, sbs 140) plus 1
              extended route (sbs 35, 35M). Looking at the trend, all are short
              trunk routes. This should convince everybody that the so called
              mid-long haul trunk services are no longer introduced. They are
              only aiming to plug those roads and those current/ new estates
              without a link to the mrt station or a nearby town centre. They are
              providing more convenience to areas which have poor links to mode
              of transports. Looking at it on a broader sense, it seems a
              plausible choice. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I think it is okay until it makes sense... routes 35, 41, 140 make more sense than 116/120/141 even today. </p>
              <p>116 loading after 2 years of introduction at NEX during PM peak remains poor with between 10-20 pax max per bus. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, sbs 119 is an important service in Punggol and
              sengkang. At various roads, it is one of only few services plying
              there. At some roads, it is the only bus service. Why people think
              is not important or redundant is because the DDs make the bus look
              empty at times. However, there is sufficient loading for single
              deck. Furthermore, the frequency is 15 mins at times. Please note
              sbs 119 is not a completely new BSEP service. The BSEP for sbs 119
              is only from sengkang int extended to Punggol int. Cheers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>All, from this BSEP exercise, we can tell that there are many areas or roads with no/few links to major transport nodes. Naturally there will be some areas with more bus services than others. Now minor roads are getting into the spotlight and more are done to ensure a good linkage to an mrt station or bus interchange. And for new towns, with new roads being constructed, they will definitely get more services. Let's all look forward to better coverage around the whole island of Singapore! Cheers.</p></div>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I take sbs 116 quite often to visit Hougang 1 mall. At those times I board this service, it starts with few people (less than 10). When the bus comes, people all come out to board. There are even people from sbs 165 (the boarding berth just next to sbs 116) switching to take sbs 116. Loading gets high enough that all seats are taken up with few standing. So it is not too bad a service. By putting sbs 116 at the current exit location of Hougang mrt, it serves to pick up people too. There are quite a substantial number of people exiting from this mrt side to take sbs 116. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the way I see it, the current route is still fine. No need to start from serangoon int as the int is packed. Cannot add another service or else sbs 81 and sbs 82 will not have to be amended in yr 2010. Sbs 81 will not need to loop at serangoon central and sbs 82 will not have to change starting int from serangoon to Punggol.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">At times where sbs 116 loading is poor, it's frequency is neither great too. Not all bus services need to assume full loading at all sectors of the route. There are always higher crowds at certain sectors to compensate for the lower loading for other sectors. If it is that bad until it is unsustainable, LTA will have amended its route after receiving so much feedback over the 2 years. The fact that the route still remains shows that it may not be too bad as mentioned. Cheers. </span></p>

              <p>cbb bro... u will be the same person later who will "again" complain about how government is wasting tax payers money by introducing not good services. If you say this, 116 is one of them. Like this, you can introduce any service tomorrow and it will fetch 30-40 pax at least on one or two trips during the day. Even if out of these 30 pax, 20 pax are those who could have taken sv 72. I just don't get the logic. Anyway, we have ppl like this in LTA also... that's why we have such services. Please do not complain again bro. And you are the last person I want to argue with coz I respect you. So peace!</p>
