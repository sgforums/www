              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I do not like to get into a war of words.
              This is my style and has always been. I don't teach people and I
              don't expect any credits. Everybody who reads all these knows who
              always starts off all these nonsense and who likes to shoot people.
              You are one who is boastful and brings down people by your
              comments. Only knows how to criticize the authority when you don't
              get it your way. You have shot me few times while I still remain
              passive and do not bother to get into all these rubbish. Show your
              knowledge without being disrespectful to others. Keep on shooting
              me and show to others your naivety. This is not the first time. If
              admins here can ban people who always shoots people, you will
              definitely be one of them. I rest my case. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Well... stop "teaching" and stop taking side of LTA every single time. I "<strong>do not</strong>" criticize LTA all the time. They are not perfect, but I defend their routes like sv 49, 121 and sv 386... even though many ppl criticize.</p>
              <p><strong>You irritate me</strong>... coz anyone posts anything... u will say LTA will not allow this and LTA will not allow that... let ppl post freely... </p>
              <p>All I was suggesting is 116 needs to be amended. I also gave my proposal which is definitely good and will not upset current commuters. I don't see any reason why you should keep on arguing to defend 116 which apart from me <strong>numerous</strong> other users have said is waste of money or let me put it politically more correct "not best use of our money". </p>
              <p>If I was saying something similar about sv 4 or sv 20 or sv 50 or sv 972... yes you can shoot me down... but <strong>after telling you </strong>that I have observed this service 20+ times at NEX on 20 different days... taken it 10+ times... observed it equal number of times at HCI... you still want to show you are right... last time you said "today I saw sv 116 has around 40 pax"... u are saying 40 pax as if the bus is bursting. Your statement itself shows that sv 116 rarely gets 40 pax also... </p>
              <p>Go on the ground and observe. If not, just shut your mouth. And I will be harsh with you, coz you really irritate me with your nonsensical posts. Sorry others for my language. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, why not? Do something constructive. Write in. If
              fail, write to your RC or even the MP if you think lobbying helps.
              At least if he or she cannot help, then at least you know you have
              done something. Better than lament here and there or in forums
              online lambasting the authority. Sbs 49 route was amended due to
              feedback to the RC and MP. Cheers.</p>

              <p>You go on talking about sbs 49... it is not a major amendment... all they did is extended the route by 3 stops... which should have been done originally itself... next u will say sv 143M got a new stop along WC... shouldn't it have got it in the first place?

              <p>43M also is Punggol to Serangoon.</p>
              <p>purpose of my suggestion was to merge 43M and 116 together thus withdrawal of either one services, such that resources can be utilised on other sides. The reason why I made the route this way was to try and retain the originality of 116 aft combining with 43M, and thus it became an amended version of 43M and runs from Punggol to Serangoon.</p>
              <p>The proposed amended route can utilise current fleet of service 116+43M Citaros, where Wrights can be used to boost the full route of Service 43.</p>

              <p>I predict some misconception for Service 35 as usual for red/white plate service extensions as seen from previous experience on 123M. Luckily some bus enthusiasts helped the BCs on the bus while joyriding to explain to passengers. An OCC Staff was deployed to Bukit Purmei too</p>
              <p>i foresee that an OCC staff member will be deployed at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal for the first day. Maybe the sign explaining red/white plate system found at Bukit Purmei will have a similar copy at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.</p>
              <p>However I think that SBST has received feedback regarding confusion and thus for 49, the destos have the destination labeled on them and placed nearer to the door</p>
              <p>I feel that SBST should format the EDS back to two-directional EDS format in order to reduce confusion.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB1112, no offence please. Combining sbs 120 and sbs 201 will be a bit long-winded. Just my two cents worth. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Random thoughts:<br>1. Does anyone know if the old Service 20 plies St George's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lane</span> in the past with those Mercedes Benz midibuses? I vaguely recall seeing defunct bus stops along the road a couple of years back before they were demolished. The road has no roundabout so 3-point turn would be required.</p>

Service 140 can then loop at Mar Thoma Rd and re-enter Serangoon Rd using St Michael's Rd. Even though the vicinity of St Michael's Rd comprise mainly landed properties, Service 140 could potentially benefit the upcoming HDB residents at Tenteram Peak if such extension could be realised. The major obstacle would be to ensure that the landed home owners not park their cars along the narrow roads so that bus ops can go on smoothly. <br><a href="http://imgur.com/TLAP9el"><img title="source: imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/TLAP9el.jpg?1" alt=""></a></p>

                      of times at HCI... you still want to show you are right... last
                      time you said "today I saw sv 116 has around 40 pax"... u are
                      saying 40 pax as if the bus is bursting. Your statement itself
                      shows that sv 116 rarely gets 40 pax also... </p>
              <p>Go on the ground and observe. If not, just shut your mouth. And
                      I will be harsh with you, coz you really irritate me with your
                      nonsensical posts. Sorry others for my language. </p>

              <p>Hi admin, if you can ban people, I suggest you ban mr
                  busanalyser from sgbuses. Show them you are not afraid of banning
                  popular but totally rude and disrespectful people. See the way this
                  was written. This is not the first time. Totally lack of respect.
                  Suggesting I am being bought over. Oh my goodness. Admin, I hope
                  you can do something about this. Cheers. </p>
