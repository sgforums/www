              <p>My guess will be 147/74e/74 berth.. for the simple reason that the same thing happen to 151e's berth. Forgive me if the following statement is incorrect, but my speculation is due to the fact that 89e uses DDs for its FFw fleet which might infer a big loading as compared to 74e which HG in turn will consider to allow 89e to continue its dedicated berth.</p>
              <p>Have never observed 89e's loading before, so like I said, everything is just speculation. </p>

              <p>got a feeling either 113 or 102 will be situated near 116's berth or 324's berth</p>
              <p>Actually 113 can shift because there are not many ppl taking this svc frm the interchange. In fact i feel 102 might be receiving quite abit of demand. Many residents are quite happy that theres a bus svc to hougang finally.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Sengkang west finally gets a new service after 3 long years (50 being the last  time) when there should have been more. Hope there will be a direct service in the future to the city from Sengkang West via Yck road, CTE..</p>

              <p>SAP is not fully developed yet... When 103 was extended... they wanted to deploy DDs on 103 extension to Yishun... but the loading hasn't really picked up much.. increased loading got offseted by some traveling to Yishun instead. </p>
              <p>I think once SAP is fully developed... 102 will get extended to loop at SAP... with both 102/103 plying DDs.</p>

              <p>+ Sengkang West Ave finally gets another service which serves
              the bus stop where only 85 plys from/to Jalan Kayu... However, I
              wonder why 102 loops at Jalan Kayu and does not go into the Seletar

              <p>I think it would be better because 850E will get to serve more passengers on the St41/Ave1/Ave 11 sector with the Ring Road passengers (towards Khatib) no need to squeeze themselves in the bus...</p>
              <p>Also maybe a hassle for those staying at St 41 previously who need to walk to Northbrooks Sec Sch Bus stop to take 850E? I not sure.. Maybe can take a look at the loading?</p>

              <p>But there could be a new service plying Sengkang West Road for sure as new industrial belt is getting developed there + Sengkang West town in general would need another service once occupancy sores up.</p>
