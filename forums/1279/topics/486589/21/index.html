              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, you are in the wrong and you still dare to
              write all these. No wonder I am right that the admin should ban
              you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I bring good news to all and you thought I am arrogant
              and a bully. This is already dunno the how many times you get so
              agitated and want to pick up a quarrel over such small issues. I
              was merely overjoyed on seeing bus stops that I let others know
              that my opinion that it came to this part of Punggol is correct.
              That's all. I am not going to earn millions of dollars over this
              announcement so why should I be arrogant and a bully? Such childish
              thinking you have!</p>
              <p>Secondly, you ask me for my opinion and you choose to either
              write rubbish or feign ignorance. Go read the post I replied you on
              11 jan inside the thread on sengkang/tampines bus expansion. You
              are really a nonsensical shit person. You really owed all the
              people in this forum an apology for being shit and twist facts. I
              copy down for all to see what I write initially. Damn rubbish
              nonsense. I am a down to right person and I am never a bully. So
              after everybody reads this before, let's get it clear. Mr
              busanalyser is really an idiot.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, it is a 50-50 fight between CCK and Punggol.
              Not sure CCK or Punggol will get the 2nd route. </p>
              <p>If it is Punggol, it may be bus int (Punggol place)- Punggol
              central-edgedale plains (horizon primary school)-edgedale plains
              end then come out Punggol drive-loop at Punggol east then whole
              stretch of Punggol central to punggol bus int. What do you think?
              Cheers.</p>

              <p>Stop proclaiming to be "I know it all". And everytime say "I know I was right". You do it too often.</p>
              <p>Lets see your credibility:</p>
              <p>1. Punggol-CCK one of the two get 2 services. 50-50 (who can't predict that)</p>
              <p>2. I hope no feeders this time (you say you predict route and then say hope no feeders)</p>
              <p>3. Bus will not be from interchange but from new stops outside at Punggol Place</p>
              <p>4. Asking others what the route will be, anxious to know what is the route</p>
              <p>5. sv 83 cannot be reversed to start at Sengkang coz Punggol Central depends on it (if u predict there is feeder for whole stretch of Punggol Central, sv 83 still can't be reversed?) lol</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, facts have all shown you are wrong. Everybody can read what I say. You are the arrogant one who knows you are soley at fault. You jolly well say in the earlier email that if I never propose a route before which I did, you will jolly well apologize. Now you know you are at fault, you choose to cover up yourself by this such mail. What a joke. </p>
              <p>Yes above are my judgements.</p>
              <p>1. Everybody can predict that but nobody says it out loud here. I say it out loud here. Some even still say other estates when it was already clearly mentioned which estates will get.</p>
              <p>2. I personally hope no feeders but I go no authority to decide. So what is wrong with me guessing?</p>
              <p>3. I did not say bus is not from interchange. You say that. I only say I spotted new bus stops outside interchange. So don't put the word in my mouth.</p>
              <p>4. I want to know actual route fast so I am anxious and ask those in this forum. What's wrong? Even until now, the route is still being guessed.</p>
              <p>5. I have supported sbs 83 to start from Punggol. I am right or else sbs 83 will have been reversed already. And by the way, this side of Punggol really needs another service in additional to sbs 83. This service may not ply Punggol central as it seems to go two sides edgedale plains.</p>
              <p>Anyway you are the one who should not get so mad. This is the ..th time you come here and show all your outburst techniques. What a joke. The pot calling the kettle Black!</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the yeah finally I am right refers to the fact that the authorities know a need for another bus service to this end of Punggol. Not referring to the exact route which is anybody guess. And I did propose a route on 11 jan when you ask. So this shows you are wrong. Let's all of us in this forum witness your credibility and we are all waiting for you to apologise and admit you are wrong when you say I did not even propose a route.</p>
              <p>So when will you admit you are wrong? Mr busanalyser, quick show your credibility. Or else nobody here will believe what you say next time. No credibility, mr bus analyser. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, are you ready to admit you are wrong? It is
              high time you learn to accept when you are wrong and stop arguing.
              This is what you write earlier on. So now that your own words come
              back to haunt you, will you apologize? In future, if no guts to
              admit wrongdoing, please do not put something in red. Surely you
              are one guy without credibility now. </p>

              <p>Should we keep arguing back and forth? That is your maturity? </p>
              <p>I am not wrong when I say, you need to stop proclaiming yourself as "right" and "know it all". Many issues including others suggestions, sv 83 etc. etc. Take a chill pill.</p>
              <p>You might have proposed a route in some other thread that I did not read, and ok I am wrong about that. But then you again, as I clearly outlined have posted so many contradictory statements on the Punggol service itself.</p>
              <p>Now, you want to go on and on and on and on... you can... </p>

              <p>You tell the whole world that I was wrong where you are the one at fault. You jolly tell all you will admit in the wrong when I show the mail. So be a man and admit it.

In any way, you are really one guy without credibility. You are only credible in coming here to rant and show your emotions times and again.

              <p>This is because at this moment, for edgedale plains, horizon pri has 2 bus stops for both directions but greendale pri has only 1 stop in 1 direction. This means the route must somehow make a loop and come back to edgedale plains to serve the stop in the opposite direction towards horizon pri. 1 possible loop is to go to Punggol plaza and Riveria LRT (Punggol east) which makes the turning seamless and convenient. </p>
              <p>This also gives those at Punggol drive a direct link to shop at Punggol plaza and also another direct link for Punggol central (backend) and Punggol east residents a link to the future poly clinic and mall at oasis LRT. All these links are currently not served by any direct bus. Sbs 50 partially to a certain extent with some walking. </p>
              <p>Any opinion and feedback is welcome. But no flaming, please. I am only merely giving my opinion. It may also be wrong. What do all of you think? Cheers.</p>

              <p>This is because at this moment, for edgedale plains, horizon pri
              has 2 bus stops for both directions but greendale pri has only 1
              stop in 1 direction. This means the route must somehow make a loop
              and come back to edgedale plains to serve the stop in the opposite
              direction towards horizon pri. 1 possible loop is to go to Punggol
              plaza and Riveria LRT (Punggol east) which makes the turning
              seamless and convenient. </p>
              <p>This also gives those at Punggol drive a direct link to shop at
              Punggol plaza and also another direct link for Punggol central
              (backend) and Punggol east residents a link to the future poly
              clinic and mall at oasis LRT. All these links are currently not
              served by any direct bus. Sbs 50 partially to a certain extent with
              some walking. </p>
              <p>Any opinion and feedback is welcome. But no flaming, please. I
              am only merely giving my opinion. It may also be wrong. What do all

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, I have already checked on Sunday and yesterday that there are no bus stops being built on edgedale plains (next to mee Toh primary school) south of Punggol plaza area. That portion of edgedale plains is very small only. </p>
              <p>If the service is trunk service, it will turn to Punggol field (opp Blk 126) then go across Punggol east flyover to other estates (sengkang, Hougang or even further).</p>
              <p>If the service is feeder service, then it will turn one round around Punggol plaza to Riveria LRT back to central and on track to horizon primary school (as that side has 2 bus stops in both directions).</p>
              <p>The crux of the issue is there is only 1 bus stop being built along edgedale plains next to greendale primary school. The other direction does not have. I am not sure it is confirmed don't have or not yet started building bus stop. </p>
              <p>Dont really think is extension of sbs386 as authorities have made it clear it is new service. Furthermore, sbs 386 goes to edgefield plains and loop deep in. To ask the residents deep in to go 1 mini round around the other side of Punggol and waste 15 min before embarking on their way to bus int/mrt does not make sense. </p>
              <p>Any inputs are greatly welcome and appreciated. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Punggol Plaza is well connected to Punggol Dr by LRT. I don't see sense of having a new service duplicating LRT almost full length of its route, except for 1-2 stops.

              <p>That's where a feeder would have been more useful. If it is a trunk service, then I welcome this routing, bcoz it cuts through the three main roads of Punggol east. Just my thoughts.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, but there is a pair of new bus stops outside horizon primary school and moreover in both directions some more. So it has to turn from edgedale plains into Punggol drive and Punggol drive to edgedale plains in the other direction. </p>
              <p>Personally, I will like to see greendale primary school having bus stops in 2 directions. This will most likely indicate that it will be a trunk service. If not, it will be feeder service again! So sianz! I will go check again tonight and tomorrow night after work. A trunk service to link to other estates (no to sengkang and Hougang) via Punggol east flyover will be preferred. </p>

              <p>From what you have observed, it does seem to be a feeder service. Just that IMO, a feeder parallel to Punggol Dr does not really make sense given there is LRT (but lets see it could be a different routing).</p>
              <p>I personally was hoping, there could be an intratown service for Punggol that does Punggol west and Punggol east, and uses the pair of bus stops outside Punggol Interchange for one loop (like 222 does). </p>
