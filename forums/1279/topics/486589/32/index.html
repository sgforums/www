              * If service is not terminating at Tampines interchange, I wish it
              loops around st 41, ave 9, ave 6 given there are many blocks here
              that have poor connectivity. Especially west part of ave 9 has no
              service and people have to walk 400-500m to nearest stop. So would
              be good to give one service to ply this road.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS5010P, your suggestion for sbs 119 from Punggol int-serangoon central (loop) will never happen. Why???</p>
              <p>If LTA really listens to you, then we will have Sbs 43M, sbs 82 and sbs 119 (3 services with same interchange from Punggol) all go to same place serangoon central. This should not be allowed to happen. 2 services from Punggol to serangoon are more than enough. There are many other places to terminate or loop in Singapore other than serangoon central which creates too many duplications even if some roads in middle are different. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Having the same destinations or looping points does not necessarily mean the services are heavily duplicated. You have services 8, 28 and 31 all from Tampines to Toa Payoh, yet you don't see LTA withdrawing or shortening any one of them, because they ply different routes. Same case with services 18, 38 and 69 which all start at Tampines and terminate/loop at Bedok (and there are also services 28 and 31 starting at Tampines and passing by Bedok MRT). If you still want some more examples, services 7, 14 and 196 all originate from Bedok and terminate at Clementi. There may be some duplication with 18, 28 and 69 in Bedok, but LTA doesn't care. Talking about 43M, 82 and 119, firstly sv 43M is only a supplementary service. Secondly they have different routes (although 82 and the new 119 may be a bit similar, but only a bit. They serve different purposes anyway). Additionally, I doubt anyone will take any of these services from Punggol all the way to Serangoon Ctrl; there's NEL for that. As long as the services have different loading patterns and people take these services to different places, I don't see a reason why they can't have the same looping point.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, at least LTA is sensible. They will not merge sbs 113 with sbs 119 as per what sbs5010P suggests and extend to serangoon central. I will rather they create new links rather than the same old serangoon central if needed. Sbs5010P logic is flawed. Sbs 113 market is different from sbs 119. By attempting to merge sbs 113 and sbs 119, you are copying sbs 82 route and also ignoring the lorong Ah soo market.</p>
              <p>Why sbs 119 loops at kovan and not further down to serangoon central? Don't forget it duplicates sbs 136 as well along upper serangoon road. Sbs 119 brings different segments of people down to an MRT station (kovan) which is deemed sufficient already. Cheers.</p>

              113</p>
              <p>* 119 and 113 merger will not inconvenience people, but the DDs
              on 119 will get better utilized between the Kovan/Serangoon Central
              stretch. </p>
              <p>* With this extension, 53A/53B/45A can be withdrawn and 119A can
              be introduced between Kovan and Serangoon Central during peak
              hours</p>
              <p>* Like 82 and 107, 113 and 119 also makes good sense for
              merging, but again depends if LTA wants to take the bold step.</p>
              <p>* This will save resources and improve the connectivity between
              towns and loading on 119. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, not very good. In this manner, sbs 119 duplicates sbs 82, 136 and also sbs 62 route. Too much duplication already. It will be better if sbs 119 is changed to another destination such as bedok or eunos after finishing kovan. Cheers.</p>

              <p>There are only so many ways before a service starts duplicating another service. Also, people will again ask why the route duplicate routes if diverted to Bedok/Eunos, because there is just that many options to take there.</p>
              <p>While I support extending 119 to Lor Ah Soo, Imhave my reservations about withdrawing that section of 113. Loading will definately drop, and its frequency has always been poor. Also, as much as I rather St 11 pax walked outside, we would try to avoid another 300 amendment situation. Here is an alternative I can think of for now.</p>
              <p>113 - St 21, Ave 1, Tamp Rd, Ave 3, Lor Ah Soo</p>
              <p>119 - St 21, Ave 1, Lor Ah Soo, wherever you want the bus to go to</p>
              <p>This amendment retain the St 11 looping points, while also increasing capacity in that area. It also lets Lor Ah Soo pax change services along Ave 3 (like 25, 87, 854) towards S'goon North/AMK, Sengkang and Seletar/YCK/Yishun respectively. This arrangement for 119 inevitably duplicates 62, but leave more options open. You can loop it around S'goon, or even loop around Toa Payoh, Tai Seng, Ubi or even Eunos via Eunos Industrial.</p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, the fact that you are having some reservations on your own without anybody prompting ndicate that sbs 113 and sbs 119 should not be merged. The fact that sbs 119 stays this current way and loop at kovan indicate that LTA has not found a better way and a better looping point. By not lengthening to other estates in east, they are obviously encouraging shorter journeys by bus and forcing you to take MRT as major mode of transport. Cheers. </p>

              <p>I would have preferred it to start from Bukit Merah as well. And seriously Tiong Bahru MRT that is so crowded already gets one more service? Should have been Redhill as closest MRT to Margaret Dr. Bad planning again.</p>
              <p>Who are these idiots who are planning routes? Seriously... I would have expected alternative to 32 for Redhill. Now once BTOs at Margaret gain more occupancy, sv 32 will burst to capacity for Redhill and then will go on adding buses on sv 32. Instead 122 should have done Bukit Merah, Redhill close, Redhill mrt and then follow the route it does right now. </p>

              <p>I would have preferred it to start from Bukit Merah as well. And
                  seriously Tiong Bahru MRT that is so crowded already gets one more
                  service? Should have been Redhill as closest MRT to Margaret Dr.
                  Bad planning again.</p>
              <p>Who are these idiots who are planning routes? Seriously... I
                  would have expected alternative to 32 for Redhill. Now once BTOs at
                  Margaret gain more occupancy, sv 32 will burst to capacity for
                  Redhill and then will go on adding buses on sv 32. Instead 122
                  should have done Bukit Merah, Redhill close, Redhill mrt and then
                  follow the route it does right now. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, not really. As people may choose to go to Tiong bahru as it is more of a focal point than red hill when they intend to go home to Margaret drive. Reason? There is Tiong bahru plaza there. As market study predicts residents may flock to Tiong bahru due to its close proximity to a mall and red hill has none. Same goes for why people rather go to harbourfront mrt (Vivocity) rather than telok blangah mrt when they want to go back to telok blangah estate. Cheers.</p>
