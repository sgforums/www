The onus is on the authorities to get down to the level of the common folk and seek their opinions, and not do things just to benefit a certain company. SBST and TIBS are linked via Temasek Holdings, so I'm unsuprised they fight with each other in "name" while they do things together behind our backs.</div>

Sv. 158 is a candidate to move to Hougang to cover the sector from Serangoon Central to Hougang. Expect to see a change in fleets if that is done so.

The PTC does things without any further thought with regards to the commuters and travelling public as a whole, they do what they like without further consultation on how it affects commuters.

Extending Sv 158 to Hougang Sector? making my trip to Mountbatten Road abit more longer....<br>I hope that Sv 166 should stay on its original route.<br>PTC, I don't know what are some hell things are you doing next when you guys are trying to make the lifes of commuters so much worsen!!! I wonder what  the f*** PTC is there for! With them, would there be a world class transportation system? I don't think so. They are destroying it gradually...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PTC, with the co-ordination of Transitlink, is making commuter's life so difficult! They are trying to force people to take the train, instead of taking bus services!!! What kinda logic are they thinking? If this continues on, I think Singapore would become an 'inaccessible' country in the future! What's the point if they continue to do thing like this, to create troubles for commuters?
