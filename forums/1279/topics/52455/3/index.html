The fact is further reinforced by the load on svc 851 today. There was a petition and outcry by the Yishun residents, but some idiot refused to budge, citing the usual services. We have to accept the change and switch to the MRT, but for people like me with a monthly pass, the MRT is rather ex, and we hence lost a direct link to Newton and Orchard that is convenient. Instead, we have to transfer buses in the Thomson area, but it can be quite troublesome.</div>

Otherwise I would have taken 171 which was run by SBS than to take MRT or to take any TIBS services. Nevermind the 90 minutes ride, at least SBS could earn my fare.<br><br>Of course they are a cartel. Otherwise why would they be called PTC - Public Transport Cartel?</div>
