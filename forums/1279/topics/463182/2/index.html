              <p><strong>MY OBESRVATIONS</strong></p>
              <p>147- HL on most parts of the route, esp. from Chinatown towards
              Clementi.</p>
              <p>196- HL between Marine Parade-Shenton Way, Jln Bt Merah-Clementi
              quite ulu... unless it's an SD...</p>
              <p>197- Mostly L(Seating) throughout the journey on Striders or
              DDs.</p>
              <p>167- Packed from Jln Bt Merah-Cecil St during 8am+</p>
              <p>961- Can vary. Sometimes ML[25% chance], L[60% chance] or HL[15%
              chance]. ML and HL is uncommon, while L is common. The sector with
              this pattern is from Jln Bt Merah-Bt Timah Rd. It is packed from
              6AM until 9AM, where loading drops significantly. MANs packed to
              the entrance door, O405s high loading only.</p>
              <p>175- Can be packed sometimes only, probably from West Coast
              Rd-Clementi, Depot Rd-Orchard Rd(pax drops significantly after
              Lucky Plaza).</p>
              <p>65- HL on most parts of the route, esp. at Orchard Rd- Little
              India(Not sure from MacPherson onwards though...)</p>
              <p>123- Can vary. From Queensway- Bt Merah Ctrl is ulu, while from
              Orchard-Outram Rd is ML. Sometimes, it is packed from Tiong Bahru
              Plaza to Bt Purmei Ave(only direct svc.)</p>
              <p>131- Not too sure abt the loading throughout the entire route,
              but it can vary from ML-HL. During 2PM++, although rare, you can
              expect to see the bus filling up at BKM Int(High Loading)-
              Henderson Rd, not sure from Harbourfront onwards.</p>
              <p>195- Super high loading from Tiong Bahru- Telok Blangah Way,
              Seating loaded(MK4) from Depot Rd- Queenstown MRT(this svc. is kind
              of the only direct svc that links many places together)...
              <span style="color: #0000ff;">AND I MEAN SUPER HIGH LOADING, WORSE
              THAN 855 DURING PEAK.</span></p>
              <p>275- NL all the way, NL all the way, but very rare to see ML on
              275, probably if there's no 131 infront.</p>
              <p>855- HL between Farrer Rd and Harbourfront during both AM/PM
              Peak(towards HBF), other direction seating(L)[50% chance] or ML[50%
              chance] only. Non peak in both directions is usually ML.</p>

              <p>Are you sure that Citaros handle load better than KUBs?? KUBs have more standing space and can take around 70 pax easily. With Citaro, BC has to actually shout at passengers to move ahead. With 60pax the bus is full, because no one moves to the rear.</p>

              <p>Even though it is a long loop but there is a sizeable crowd who takes this service from Hougang Ave 2 Blk 708 bus stop from what I have observed (some might be passengers taking 25, 55 or 854). For the opposite side, it has lesser loading but the crucial stop is along Hougang Ave 2 (e.g. passengers may change to Sv 25, 55 or 854) Also serve another alternative to Sv 132 for those staying around Blk 700+ area who take from Hougang Central Interchange. </p>
              <p>Perhaps the run time could be improved. But problem faced during peak hour might be the long wait for the right turn from UPS to Hg Ave 2 and the right turn from Ave 2 to Ave 10... </p>

              <p>If it is raining, undoubtedly pessangers are more willing to take the long loop from HG Int through Hougang Avenue 2. Because there is a MRT underground pass, if people forgot to bring umbrellas, they have no choice but to board the bus from the interchange. Oddly I now see more people willing to take 325 over the loop.</p>

              <p>Btw anyone got any comment regarding Sv 172 and/or Sv 975 (esp during book out on Friday evenings)?</p>
              <p>From what I have observed, one word: disastrous (especially heading twds CCK direction)</p>

              <p>Even though it is a long loop but there is a sizeable crowd who
              takes this service from Hougang Ave 2 Blk 708 bus stop from what I
              have observed (some might be passengers taking 25, 55 or 854). For
              the opposite side, it has lesser loading but the crucial stop is
              along Hougang Ave 2 (e.g. passengers may change to Sv 25, 55 or
              854) Also serve another alternative to Sv 132 for those staying
              around Blk 700+ area who take from Hougang Central
              Interchange. </p>
              <p>Perhaps the run time could be improved. But problem faced during
              peak hour might be the long wait for the right turn from UPS to Hg
              Ave 2 and the right turn from Ave 2 to Ave 10... </p>

              <p>Most people who want to take MRT from HG Ave 2 use Kovan and not HG. They also have more services 107, 112, 113 taking them to Kovan. The bus is mainly for people along st 51, 91, 93 and if they have to take it from interchange, waster 15 mins la.</p>

              <p>One suggestion. Please indicate the time of boarding. From what I see it is clearly off peak hours, because no one boarded bus at Pandan loop. s285 can have very high loading during peak hours. Hence, 3 DDs have been deployed on this service in past few months. </p>

              <p>Average loading ought to be higher for 284 because the division factor is very small compared to s282 and s285. Highest number of pax is the right indicator.</p>

              <p>And two things that I observed during my loading observation. At Clementi Interchange today, a long queue of people waiting for service 7, streched for about two to three berths today at around 12.45 PM before I boarded 282. Once I came back to the interchange, no more long queue. No idea what happened to the bus driver.</p>
              <p>And also when arriving at the bus stop (Opp Blk 701) on 285, a bus stop notice board had its glass pane smashed. But didn't manage to snap a picture as I was busy on bus loading observation.</p>
