              <p>So the peak loading was higher when you surveyed. For me, since I did it in the earlier part of evening peak, the return route loading was higher. When you went around 7.30pm, the peak loading from Changi Industrial estate had already gone, so make sense on return the bus was not full.</p>
              <p>Overall, I think it is a good service!!! I doubt svc <strong>116</strong> has reached a loading of 46 yet (90% times, def not!!!) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>B.A., just to tell you, I will be travelling during off peak hours(in the afternoon) as I need to go for my SMRT Scania L113CRL ELBO joyride after that. Plus, I will just roughly give you the NL, ML, L and HL format. However, if you need to know the exact figures, I should be able to do it as counting pax on an SD is relatively easy. Furthermore, I won't be expecting more than 20 people on the bus during that time.</p>

              <p>True. Just last week I saw 2 back to back MAN buses on 857 at Boon Keng MRT, both packed to the door. If the service was with SBST, for sure it would be at least 50% DD fleet. SMRT should deploy more bendies on this service.</p>

              <p>Let's be utterly honest, SMRT simply doesn't have the resources to commit to 857. How many spare bendies does AMDEP have? WLDEP might be able to spare a few but I think they'd rather keep it for WDL intratowns and feeders. </p>
              <p>By making it WAB some time back could have worsened the situation given low floor buses sub optimal standing space. OCs might help but how many units can they spare again? I would think that they are damned aware of the situation just that there is nothing much they can do given their current modus operandi (or perhaps a lack of will).</p>

Though I haven't seen svc 90 to be extremely crowded even during peak hours. Does the high loading come at Tai Seng MRT?? I doubt. The service is in parallel with svc 8 until Tai Seng MRT, and svc 8 has a 5-6 minute morning peak frequency. Even in evenings I see KUBs moderately crowded, not crowded to the door.</p>
              <p>I repeat I have observed svc 90 morning / evening peak many times at Toa Payoh and Macpherson. So <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where is this high loading</span> of svc 90??? Let me know if you know the reply.</p>

              <p>What i rmb about 857 everytime i want to take it, i have to wait around 20 minutes for it almost in any part of the route during off-peak, took it bfore CTE,Took it at esplanade,Took it at Selegie Road, Took it at Boon Keng MRT, Took it at Little India and even worse of all Yishun Interchange- One time the crowd exceeded the line luckily the bus that came was 998D.</p>

              <p>actually 857's frequency is not bad during peak hours. 4-5 mins per bus. but it is really not the frequecy problem for 857 already. it is really urgent and needed for high capacity buses to be deployed during peak hours. I always board at the bus stop just few stops after yishun interchange and I am always unable to board them and have to wait for 3-4 buses. although it was merely a 15-20 minutes wait till i can board the bus, i still think its simply ridiculous. This problem has been happening for years and nothing has been done. Making 857 WAB with so many Citaros somehow made the matters worse as Citaro couldnt really accomodate that many people compared to other SDs. I just hope 2-3 bendies can ply 857 during peak hours. During non peak hours, 15-20 minutes wait i think is rather ok because really not much load. but frequency should stay 4-5 minutes after 7pm till the last bus as well. Alot of people returning to Yishun at that point of time which i dun understand why. </p>

              <p>High chance it will be deployed on AMDEP for the WAB services with non-WAB bendies and KJDEP for massive MK1 bendy replacements. Not to worry 190 doesn't have THAT much MK1 bendies. It's services like 180, 184 and 964 which kind of need these A24 replacements when the MK1s go off. </p>
              <p>But strangely why is it at WLDEP and not the other 2 depots...</p>
