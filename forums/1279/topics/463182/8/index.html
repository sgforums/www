              <p>These queues are similar to the 291 evening peak queues on both loops at Tampines between 17.45 and 19.45 hours. You need 2 back-to-back DDs to clear the load. Ofcourse, 291 is unique that when the buses come, at least 2-3 of them come together, so normally the 3rd bus goes empty and then for 10 minutes there is no bus.</p>

              <p><br>Also reminds me of the evening peak 225G load before 2 DDs were added on this service. Between 17.30 and 20.00 hours, you will always see some leftovers after B10M and KUB have left the stop. 225W on the other hand is just fine with SDs, each bus loading just meets 60-70 pax in evening peak, and then drops drastically after. The peak hour loading is shorter for 225W than 225G (18.00 - 19.30 hours).</p>

Prepare for 88 to go crazy. 88 got ITE, AMK MRT, Bishan MRT, Toa Payoh, Pasir Ris then now got Buangkok Vale HDB flats. (Probably thats why every bus (except for 156 but maybe soon) [is/has been] under BSEP.</p>
              <p>30... walao eh. I waited 35mins from CDAC Bldg bus stop then a full DD came. Found a seat upstairs. Other ppl wan stand on upper deck, got ppl tell them cannot stand <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. </p>

              <p>You know, when the Buangkok Vale HDB flats are ready, DDs will be first added to 43 before giving them to 88 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> (read sarcasm). 88 might get Citaro additions <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> </p>

I felt the bus was still smooth, good speed, only at sharp turnings I felt it was tilting a bit, but maybe its psychological since I know the bus is really old.</p>
              <p>The LO overtook a VO3x on 56 with amazing ease on Thomson. I was impressed considering the bus is old.</p>

              <p>B.A., just to tell you, I will be travelling during off peak hours(in the afternoon) as I need to go for my SMRT Scania L113CRL ELBO joyride after that. Plus, I will just roughly give you the NL, ML, L and HL format. However, if you need to know the exact figures, I should be able to do it as counting pax on an SD is relatively easy. Furthermore, I won't be expecting more than 20 people on the bus during that time.</p>
