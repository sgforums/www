                              113's "certain sector" is about 100-130pax (I saw 3 consecutive KUBs full within 10mins that call at the hougang st 21 FC) after 7pm and ard 60-70 pax aft 6pm. Dont forget the students that take the bus too. U can go and try taking this bus service after 6 or 7pm. U can hear those aunties and uncles complaining.
                              325 dosent need DDs. It has more than ENOUGH buses.
                              By right, i think 325 should have only 6-7 buses and 113 at least 9 buses.
                              112's demand is unpredictable. i hardly see 112 full though, the most i have seen that pax are all fully seated. 116 is introduced for a reason. 317's loading is mostly to the SGN garden circus and serves as an alternative for 315.

              <p>IMO too 101, 112, 113, 116, 315, 317, 325 don't need DDs. 113 has high loading from Kovan to Lor Ah Soo (uni-directional) during peak hours, but its loading is only where 113A plies, and hence you have 113A. The route of 113 from Kovan to HG is redundant. You have 62, 82, 107, 112, 325, 74, 147 covering its route at different parts of the route. </p>
              <p>Regarding other services, I totally agree that 59 and 69 need more DDs. 74 should get 2 more DDs and should be okay, 147 should get 1 more DD and 4 SDs can ply by adjusting headways right behind the DD to take additional passengers. 240, 242 can cope well with the load as of now. </p>

              <p>116 loading still not that good. Around 30-35 pax observed during peak hours, around 15-20 in non-peak hours. It has taken some load off 315, but you will still see 315 with around 50-60 pax during peak hours. Maybe 116 stop should have matched 315 stop at NEX. I think people are just lazy to go to the opposite side to take bus when they get 43, 70, 315 from NEX. </p>

              <p>I agree that 97, 153, 165 don't need as many DDs. 5 DDs on 153 are fine to match the peak loading timings, 165 loading is high between Thomson to Hougang and have 74, 132, 166 as alternatives. I would not reduce capacity on 132 if you reduce on 165 as there is high loading between Thomson and Hougang during morning and evening peak. This is actually the main loading for 132. I would not worry for Redhill - Bukit Merah because you have 145A during morning peak. Recently, 166 did have capacity increase with 1 SD getting replaced with DD. On the other hand, 3 months back 97 reduced capacity with 2 DDs getting replaced to SDs. </p>

              <p>112 can have good loading but my observation is that SDs are catering to the load very well. The loading is between 50-70 pax and you are right there is no weak point in the route because in morning peak you have loading from HG Ave 2 to Kovan and in the other direction between Tampines Road and Kovan MRT. It does not have high loading throughout. </p>

              Pic of loading or it never happened.<br>
              <br>
              Really, who the fuck takes 113 to make a useless loop around
              Hougang Plaza when there is already a 107 straight down from
              Hougang Int straight to Kovan?</p>

              Pic of loading? It happens everyday. Why would i need to take a pic of it to make it a common phenomenon? If u talk about the 'useless' loop, there is a small demand. The students and residents. Admit it. 325 dosent deserve that much buses, kid. Put urself in the shoes of ppl taking 113 from kovan.

              <p>112 not having DDs might be due to 325 dupliacting it's route I

              <p>325 does not duplicate the route of 112. They are very different. I think reason is simple that 112 is coping well with SDs for now with peak loading just touching to 60-70 pax. With new housing complexes, if the loading increases, DDs will have to be considered - but for now it is okay IMO</p>

              <p>Actually a good idea to just extend 119 to Upper Paya Laber and withdraw 113. This way 119 DDs will also get well utilized.</p>
              <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
              <p>Extend 113 to Serangoon, and remove the Kovan - Hougang part, then 113 can still be justified for DDs with withdrawal of 53A, 53B, 45A. </p>

              <p>Ha ha... Even I was like "what the...." when I read it. 27, 74, 147 are one of the top few high loading services for SBST. </p>
              <p>Just to add on 147 since you didn't say much. The high loading is HG Ave 8 to Serangoon, Bendemeer Road to Chinatown, Chinatown to Queensway. For long stretches on its route, the loading is +80-90 pax, also touching 110-120 pax at some point in its route. I would just add that most times, the SDs are just behind a DD so it manages well with the extra load. But it gets really irritating when the SD comes first, and DD is right behind. </p>
              <p>Regarding 74, this service also has 120 pax towards AMK MRT, and then again picks up load towards Ngee Ann Polytechnic to reach 120 pax.</p>
