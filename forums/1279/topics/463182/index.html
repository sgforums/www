              <p>Please share your loading levels observed on different services.</p>
              <p>I took svc 116, Bus# 6324C at 05.50pm yesterday at NEX. It is more than a month now that this service has been launched.</p>
              <p>Loading is as follows: NEX (15), Boundary Rd (19), YCK Link (21), Toho Green (27), <strong>AMK Ave 3 (28pax),</strong> Serangoon NTh Ave 4 (18), Hougang Ave 9 (25), Hougang Ave 4 (21), Hougang Int (17).</p>
              <p>The peak loading was at AMK Ave 3 - 28 pax.</p>
              <p>Loading status: Still not that good.</p>

              <p>I think it must be because of the fleet addition in last 2-3 months, one Citaro and Wright. The frequency has improved, increase in number of trips, but the number of pax traveling must have not increased much. </p>
              <p>Hence, it seems to have got distributed. But I think it is good, because earlier it was quite uncomfortable for people to stand all the way on TPE. </p>

              <p>I took EXP 513 to understand the loading level on the 5th day. Brand new Wright. You can sense the freshness. </p>
              <p>Tampines Ave 5 Mosque (5), Blk 863 (12), st 83 (20), st 83 Blk 835 (25), Ave 3 (31), Ave 8 (36), Ave 1 SAFRA (5+3+3+8 = 55).</p>
              <p><strong>Peak loading at SAFRA = 55 pax. </strong></p>
              <p>I think the loading has picked up quite well for this service, and ofcourse it deserves DD given that it is express service. </p>
              <p>I think in another 2-3 months, there will be 1 or 2 more trips introduced else we can expect DDs to have a few standees. </p>
              <p>Anyone else observed loading on 513?</p>

              <p>Tampines MRT (67), Tampines Ave 5 (89), <strong>SAFRA (96 peak)</strong>, Tampines Ave 1 - before Ave 10 (74), Bedok North before PIE (72), PIE (69), Jalan Besar before Bendemeer (47), Rochor Canal Road (37 pax)....</p>
              <p>I got down at this stop, but observed a lot of people who got in at Jalan Besar continued on the bus when it turned into Serangoon road. Most pax were long haul, except for those who boarded at Tampines MRT got down along Temasek Poly on Tampines Ave 1.</p>

              <p>Good observations, bro. Just a few observations of mine that differ from yours.</p>
              <p>147 has high loading between Chinatown and YCK road as well as Clementi to Jalan Bukit Merah</p>
              <p>197 has high loading between AYE and Jurong sector, L otherwise and again HL between Guillemard road and Marine Parade</p>
              <p>175 hardly ever see high loading on this route</p>
              <p>123 very high loading only between Bukit Purmei and TB Plaza</p>
              <p>131 high loading between Tehlok Blangah Way to Shenton Way (morning peak), Shenton Way to Rangoon road (evening peak). This route is worthy for DDs but because of Henderson road and Pei Kio Estate cannot</p>
              <p>Totally agree on 195, 196, 855, 961</p>

              <p>167- Packed from Jln Bt Merah-Cecil St during 8am+</p>
              <p>961- Can vary. Sometimes ML[25% chance], L[60% chance] or HL[15%
              chance]. ML and HL is uncommon, while L is common. The sector with
              this pattern is from Jln Bt Merah-Bt Timah Rd. It is packed from
              6AM until 9AM, where loading drops significantly. MANs packed to
              the entrance door, O405s high loading only.</p>
              <p>175- Can be packed sometimes only, probably from West Coast
              Rd-Clementi, Depot Rd-Orchard Rd(pax drops significantly after
              Lucky Plaza).</p>
              <p>65- HL on most parts of the route, esp. at Orchard Rd- Little
              India(Not sure from MacPherson onwards though...)</p>
              <p>123- Can vary. From Queensway- Bt Merah Ctrl is ulu, while from
              Orchard-Outram Rd is ML. Sometimes, it is packed from Tiong Bahru
              Plaza to Bt Purmei Ave(only direct svc.)</p>
              <p>131- Not too sure abt the loading throughout the entire route,
              but it can vary from ML-HL. During 2PM++, although rare, you can
              expect to see the bus filling up at BKM Int(High Loading)-
              Henderson Rd, not sure from Harbourfront onwards.</p>
              <p>195- Super high loading from Tiong Bahru- Telok Blangah Way,
              Seating loaded(MK4) from Depot Rd- Queenstown MRT(this svc. is kind
              of the only direct svc that links many places together)...
              <span style="color: #0000ff;">AND I MEAN SUPER HIGH LOADING, WORSE
              THAN 855 DURING PEAK.</span></p>
              <p>275- NL all the way, NL all the way, but very rare to see ML on
              275, probably if there's no 131 infront.</p>
              <p>855- HL between Farrer Rd and Harbourfront during both AM/PM
              Peak(towards HBF), other direction seating(L)[50% chance] or ML[50%
              chance] only. Non peak in both directions is usually ML.</p>

              <p>Good observations, bro. Just a few observations of mine that
                      differ from yours.</p>
              <p>147 has high loading between Chinatown and YCK road as well as
                      Clementi to Jalan Bukit Merah</p>
              <p>197 has high loading between AYE and Jurong sector, L otherwise
                      and again HL between Guillemard road and Marine Parade</p>
              <p>175 hardly ever see high loading on this route</p>
              <p>123 very high loading only between Bukit Purmei and TB Plaza</p>
              <p>131 high loading between Tehlok Blangah Way to Shenton Way
                      (morning peak), Shenton Way to Rangoon road (evening peak). This
                      route is worthy for DDs but because of Henderson road and Pei Kio
                      Estate cannot</p>
              <p>Totally agree on 195, 196, 855, 961</p>

              <p>131 has 4 anti-DD places lolz... that's why SBST is spamming zee SDs on it...</p>
              <p>Henderson Rd, Telok Blangah Way, Pei Kio Estate, Bt Purmei Ave(narrow+sharp roundabout at the end of the road.)</p>
              <p>For 147, Clementi-Jln Bt Merah I agree, but from Jln Bt Merah-Clementi during AM Peak is ML even on DDs... The most you can expect at that timing is seating(L) only. Actually, the pax fills up at Chinatown(towards the direction of Clementi), however, I am not too sure where all this "chinatown crowd" alights.</p>
              <p>I don't count the exact number of pax BTW, I just follow the NL, ML, L, HL and HHL(esp. svc 179/190) guidelines.</p>
              <p>I don't observe loading levels for hobby purposes, but instead to know when to avoid the bus(crowded~)... Eg. I would rather take 123 instead of 195 from Tiong Bahru to Lower Delta Rd, even if 123 is packed to the brim...

              <p>Yes. I see that most people here are interested in deployments, while I like to observe loading levels on buses ~ gives you the exact understanding of how the bus loads/unloads on the route. Once you know this, then it makes sense to know which services need DDs/bendies and which are comfortable with just SDs.</p>

              <p>I think the best way to evaluate by observing loading at key bus stops like Little India, SAFRA, AMK Ave 3, Buona Vista, Lakeside MRT - so you know if there are passengers left behind and whether buses are going empty or full. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>98A needs better scheduling. The load on 98A is purely MRT driven. Once train comes from Jurong side, bus will get filled to 60-70 pax. For 98A if it follows svc 98 that already has 40-50 pax on board, the svc 98 is fully packed, and 98A that comes in later takes in only 10-12 pax. At least the bus captain should wait for 02 mins for the next MRT train to arrive rather than going empty as the purpose for SWT is for MRT. IMO.</p></div>
