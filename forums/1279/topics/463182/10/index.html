              <p>WLBP and Kranji are DD friendly to start with. SMRT can start small with using these 2 spaces for parking DDs. They just need to get a few more high capacity bus additions. Maybe 100 to start with. Not a 550 Volve Wright order like SBST did.</p>

              <p>A problem though... I don't think they have yet to free up exactly 100 spaces in KJDEP even up till now, although some services were transferred from KJ&gt;WL due to WLDEP having more bendy-friendly features and also to free up KJ's space.</p>
              <p>Thus... AM and KJ are not ready to accomodate DDs yet. KJ just needs more space, that's all.</p>
              <p>Then again WLDEP... The parking area and some other areas are anti-DD. WLBP is DD-friendly but... those services still have to go to WLDEP for inspection and all sorts of things etc., which means entering the anti-DD WLDEP.</p>
              <p>The only depot that can accomodate DDs might be KJ, but I doubt enough spaces have been freed yet... WLBP on the other hand... read the paragraph above this one...</p>

              <p>16.24 - svc04 - 6368B (27p)</p>
              <p>This random observation was when I was waiting for my colleague and I reached before time to do some observations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My observation on 72 again remain unchanged</span> that in non-peak hours also the frequency from Tampines Int is one bus in every 05 mins. The loading is around 20-30 pax compared to what it used to be before. Guess just too many buses thrown on this service given the peak hour loading, but surprising that off-peak also the frequency is 'awesome'.</p>

              <p>Another point that I would like to make is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">svc4 loading is GOOD</span></strong>. Even in off-peak, the bus is taking +20pax at Tampines Int, and if you see the loadings posted by yenwei, TIB501D and myself, I think it is doing better than many other services already.Â </p>
              <p>I am wondering what the Flora rd residents used to do ~ take private operator buses. That must have been expensive + no advantage of change fee to MRT/other bus.Â </p>

              <p>My personal observation on svc 116 since its launch on 18-Nov-2012</p>
              <p>It has been 5 months since 116 was introduced. I feel somewhere LTA &amp; SBST failed to capture a good loading route for this service. During off-peak, the loading is a mere 15-20 pax (90% times) and during morning / evening peak as well the bus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hardly gets more than 40 pax</span> (90% times).</p>
              <p>If at all 116 has taken away some load from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">72</span> from Hougang 1 to HG MRT. With increase in 72 frequency from Jan, that too has taken away some of the load from 116 itself in Nov/Dec between Hougang 1 and HG MRT.</p>
              <p>315 still has better loading than 116. At Serangoon Nth Ave 4, people just take whichever bus comes first. If it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">315</span> they take it and don't really wait for 116. 116 takes away some load from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">43/70</span> on YCK Road towards NEX is what I observed. The real load from Serangoon Nth Ave 4 to NEX will be just about 15 pax during peak hours.</p>
              <p>In the evening hours, 116 does not help relieve load on 43/70 on YCK road till AMK Ave 3 junction, as its bus stop is opposite side of NEX. In fact, people prefer to take 315 at Interchange or NEX rather than walk to bus stop opp NEX. 116 should be re-reouted via Boundary road to NEX bus stop to have common synergies with 43/70/315. I see that svc 4 and svc 50 that were introduced later are doing way better than 116. Just my thoughts :-)</p>

              <p>Exaclty. People don't want to do that and reasonably so!</p>
              <p>116 should call on 43/70/315 bus stop. The bus stop is chaotic, but to avoid that <strong>81 </strong>can be moved to the bus stop opposite NEX. It will actually provide commuters faster link to Upper Serangoon road than do a full round of Boundary road.</p>
              <p><strong>82 should be merged with 107</strong> and extend to Marina Center. 82 and 107 have exactly the same route from Serangoon to Hougang. This way can provideÂ direct connectivity for HG / SGK / PGL residents to other areas of NEL. The DDs on 107 will also be better utilized.</p>
