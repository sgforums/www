              <p>851 - i believe is due to WAB operations. shld buy more WAB bendies to meet the demand in this case.</p>

              <p>67 and 176 from my recent experiences still have some bendies. Altho off peak doesnt make much sense to have lots of them cause of low ridership.</p>

              <p>171 don't really need bendies. OCs can cope.</p>

              <p><br>61: Dun really understand this. In Mar 2008 when 61 went under WLDEP controlled, only 1 bendy and all rigids were deployed. Things doesn't change when back to KJDEP controlled again last year, spare OC500LEs were deployed instead. For AMDEP side, bendies were also cut and some were replaced by UK Lances. Especially the recent TIB1074M incident and AMDEP took a chance to reduce yet another bendy and replaced with TIB1012S...</p>
              <p>171: 1st bendy TIB838H was put on trial. But not at all now.</p>
              <p>851: Bendy fleets were not affected all these while. The OC500LEs basically replaced all the rigids (0405s/Lances) between 2008-2009. TIB798P and the perm bendies remain behind.</p>
              <p>859: Full bendies between 2001-2005, after which fleet addition of rigids when route change to terminate at Sembawang Int. And somehow in 2009, 859 was downgraded to full rigid fleet by WLDEP.</p>
              <p>980: Bendies deployed only on Sun/PH. However the deployment of bendies are not stable though...</p>

              <p><br>700: Remember this service used to have a number of bendies when newly
                  introduced as a Rapidbus in 1998. Now there seems to be only 1-2 bendies
                  once a while...</p>
              <p>960: Used to have full bendy fleet, but due to some reasons some bendies were replaced with rigid 0405s instead.</p>
              <p>I wonder if SMRT does these in order to cut fuel costs or not...</p>

              <p>For 61's case, It is clearly not enough with the current fleet of bendies. 67 I feel is definitely much better, AM 67 side if I am not wrong all bendies are full day starters if not almost all bendies are, KJ only 1 or 2 chip in, The rest stays split.</p>
              <p>859's case, I will stay silent but is it really nesscesary to deploy bendies, other than weekends?</p>
              <p>980, I'm still not sure. I've ever taken a bendy on 980 before, TIB1228L, but I don't sense any crowd coming to the GL1 side.</p>
