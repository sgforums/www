If you think 186, making an extra loop round Marina South area will make it burst, then i suggest you bursting your head by banging to the wall. Then, you smart aleck, what do you suggest about 400 then? Make it start from Marina South Int and make a round around Marina South area then loop at shenton way ter ah? Why leave such a service while you can easily integrate with some other service?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Correct, but you think 400 doesn't need buses one ah? Besides Marina South is getting more and more popular and the reason why people dont usually go there is because of the lack of public transport, and the MRT is so far away. and you don't say it is NEVER going to be practical. You can see the future ah? go and see a psycologist lar. In fact, it is practical enough to carry out my plan even now. Reason why 400 is so "cold" cause very little people would like to transfer bus at Shenton Way area. If 186 is the one serving Marina South, more people will be willing to go Marina South. So, I strongly urge you to filter your words before you type out, cause given your carelessness, you are bound to talk crappy statements.</div>

The extra ERP charges if you merge the two services together is going to be quite insignificant. It is not going to cost a bomb or something. Remember. The new quay is located at Marina South and there are numerous plans at Marina South. So, loadings around Marina South will improve eventually.<br><br>Remember. The scenario here is Shenton Way is closed and Marina South Terminal is erected to preplace Shenton Way Terminal. Get this right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I somehow think that Marina South is a good place to built a Terminal.. thiS way, Shenton Way aND Marina Center could close down.. all the bus service from this 2 terminal could move over to Marina South.. this way, it could somehow save abit of money.. and.. Next time.. when the nEw downtown is being built over at Marina south, it ouldnt be too late to plan out all this routes as the MArina South Bus terminal is already there.. better if the terminal is a big one.. possible to hold between 17 to 23 bus services.. CBD area mahz.. haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
