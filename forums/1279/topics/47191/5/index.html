For this week, the drivers on svc 806 were assigned different buses from that they had been driving. For example, the bus driver that used to drive TIB1164L for the past 6 months now drive TIB1163 today, TIB1176 yesterday, all of which are 806 Bendys. There are also 3 new drivers on 806 today.<br><br>This goes for the same on trunk services. Instead of the old man who drives the TIB1014 on the 0635 trip, I got a driver who used to be on 855 driving TIB715 ( Lucky! )</div>
