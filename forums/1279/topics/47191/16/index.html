Try taking a Lance on 171 and have the driver speed along bumpy Mandai Road and tell me how your butt feels.<br><br>I had my first piles appearing on my ass after I took a Lance 171 from Yishun to Ngee Ann Poly. And that driver sped along that stretch of Bt Timah Road leading up to Beauty World Centre, at the time there were heavy construction along that road for that flyover which resulted in lots of humps, holes, bumps and weaves along that stretch of road. And no I am NOT kidding about the piles I had from that Lance.<br><br>When I take a Lance, I'd rather the driver NOT speed at all and keep under 40 km/h.</div>

And that driver sped along that stretch of Bt Timah Road leading up to Beauty World Centre, at the time there were heavy construction along that road for that flyover which resulted in lots of humps, holes, bumps and weaves along that stretch of road.

Its a pain in the butt when the bus pulls into one of those brick surfaced bus stops along Mandai Rd, but I respect then power that the B245 Cummins can generate during the morning peak. The stretch of road up to BWC has been resurfasced, so its kinds smooth now.<br><br>I think that the worse service to use the Lance 245s is on svc 855, esp the forwqard direction to Harbourfront. For some unknown reasons, the bus physically "rock n roll " for an hour to the terminal violently, much more than other services.<br><br>Lance 245s should speed, the power is okay, but NOT the LAnce 211...have mercy on those sitting in the last few rows , and those standing when it brakes suddenly. But I agree with you, LAnces can be enjoyable for short hops, esp when the aircon is freezing , esp the TIB91X series.</div>
