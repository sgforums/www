When 2603Z had a burning smell from the bus and passengers are making a huge fuss over it (somehow a little panic), the driver continued on from Tampines Central to Tampines Ave 10 or 12. Then he declared the bus dead. Seems that he did not want to end at Tampines Central, which enable others to board sv 969. I believe, if 2603Z continued on to TPE, it will definitely catch fire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But first, here is what I observed today. Yanxin SMSed me today telling me of a VSO on Sv. 88. He said he saw it along Punggol Rd going to Toa Payoh at 12.30, I estimated the timings, went to Bishan MRT bus stop and waited for 20 mins, and guess what I saw?<br><br>*drumroll*<br><br>*<br>**<br>***<br>****<br>*****<br>******<br>*******<br>********<br>*******<br>******<br>*****<br>****<br>***<br>**<br>*<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  SBS 9817C on Sv. 88!<br><br>I took it to Toa Payoh Lor 6.

However, by yesterday, SBS 2701 Y and SBS 1814 M were on Sv 105. Hmm, I wonder if there could be more Volvos or more MB O.405 CAC for sv 105. What I really hope is more Volvo Buses for sv 105!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>It is true that TIB 1120 M is a permanent bus for sv 106... Poor 106... It is somehow in the way of losing one or two Habits, and being sub by Lance 211 (TIb 1016G 2 days ago), or MB O.405 CAC.</div>
