I hope they do have plans to let the buses have "early retirement". The bus is too underpowered. I often hear drivers complaining abt the bus being too underpowered. However, they can still keep them as training bus. Do you think they will be moved to CSS?</div>

Esp the seats with the "humps" above the wheel. Older SBST buses have smaller legrooms as the older generation are smaller in size and the bus was designed then.

I honestly think that the LAnce 211s should consider using the quite powerful Fuji AC, maybe it would improve the bus a bit, but it is still too lousy for me even with that.</div></blockquote>1. Tibs interchanges in the west of Singapore has been getting DAF buses lately, e.g. svc 67. However, they don't seem to be permanent.<br><br>2. Nissan Diesels are still operating on 853 on weekdays. However, I noticed that service 852 and 853 have been using quite a bit of O.405 lately.<br><br>3. The condition of TIB 1015 J is deteriorating. Those who think that Lance 211s are good buses, take the bus. The bus is normally on service 169, but deployed on service 854 on 14 June.<br><br>4. The deployment of Tibs are really unstable these days. Wonder what's going on. Lance 245s and L113s going around, speculate that it's due to the selling of these 2 buses.<br><br>5. I think whoever deploy Lance 211 to service 851 is not aware of the condition of the bus. Giving a Lance 211 to a popular and packed service, I've seen passengers fanning in the bus.<br><br>6. The Nissan Diesel on svc 854 should be a substitute bus for a O.405. Seeing UDs on svc 854 is as though going back to the good ol' days of 1993, when svc 854 got it's first AC Nissan Diesel.</div>

When you board the bus, the front is artic, the rear is the core of the earth. You can feel the engine heat coming out from 2 or 3 rows before the last rows of seat. This is how <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">terrible</span></span></strong> the bus is. The engine seems to be overheated already.</div>

Above the engine. I do admit the engine is hot but the air-con keeps the bus cool and comfortable. Today SBS 9353Z on Express 501 has a DHL all-over ad, but with contravision sticker on upper deck windscreen and SBS Transit text on lower deck windscreen in red, not transparent like SBS 9630Z.<br><br>This could mean SBS 9630Z was used as a demo bus for this kind of ad.</div>
