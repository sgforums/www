The O405 you saw should be a supplementary bus. I guess this is a measure by Tibs to release Bendy Buses for other services (Someone saw O405G on service 857 today). In my opinion, O405 is deployed because there's always few passengers left after the Bendy Bus left and therefore it's a waste to use Bendy Buses as the load is low as the next bus often come below 3 to 5 minutes frequency.<br><br>Welcome to Singapore Buses forum again. Interesting to know you decided to join after seeing TIB 975 U.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, TIB975U is deployed on svc 806 today with CL Lee as the driver. He is the 5th driver on 806, besides TIB1160, 1163, 1164 and 1176. He is originally from svc 804., and I guess that he may be training to drive the Bendys that may come on svc 804 soon, hopefully. TIB975U is just another 5th bus on 806, and the 5th bus on 806 is never fixed as it is a recent addition to the fleet. For the past few days, it had been TIB1126 with the Voith-sounding transmission ( I think it should be ZF, but the gears do sound like Voith ).<br><br>The 0405 is actually TIB526H, and had been deployed on svc 804 for a number of times. The reason why this bus is deployed because I guess TIB1176C is being taken out of service some time during the day, as I took TIB1176C in the morning and came back in the evening to see the same driver, TL Lim, driving TIB526H. It is kinda interesting to see how badly an 0405 copes with the 806 demand during evening peak, with many pax couldn't get on when Bendys can get filled to the brim.</div>

Welcome onboard.<br><br>This is definitely the first time a Citaro (O405 2nd edition) is on service 806, at least to me. The O405 you saw should be a supplementary bus. I guess this is a measure by Tibs to release Bendy Buses for other services (Someone saw O405G on service 857 today). In my opinion, O405 is deployed because there's always few passengers left after the Bendy Bus left and therefore it's a waste to use Bendy Buses as the load is low as the next bus often come below 3 to 5 minutes frequency.<br><br>Welcome to Singapore Buses forum again.
