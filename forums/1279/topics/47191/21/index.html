TIB 106X series have more stanchions, but Box Bendys have just too many handbars! What i enjoy doing on a Box Bendy is to walk thru the aisle with my hands touching the handlebars...<br><br>Number of handlebars and stanchions on TIBS MB Volgren is very good (4 handlebars per "section"). I wonder why SBST are removing handlebars from their SDs?<br><br>|_________________________________|<br>|                |                |                 |<br>(__)          (__)           (__)           (__)<br></div>

I either grab the top bar or use the stanchion poles or the seat handles. This is because the handstraps are potential hazards to the taller people who risk knocking into them when they get a seat....whats more, its kinda noisy when the handstraps knock onto the stanchion poles.<br><br>The handstraps also do not provide adequate support as they sway, esp when one is carrying some things.<br><br>If you think that handstraps on bendys are too few, you may want to know that PA LAnce 211s have no handstraps at all, not even a stanchion pole in the industrial-sized standing space for pax to grab on, considering the rather high acceleration and deceleration of the type.</div>

There are only two of them - TIB741C and TIB779U. And both of them take turns to serve in 855. And they do not serve in the Woodlands trunk svc because both of them belong to AMKDEP. The rest of the CAC O405's have rooftop A/C's. As for O405 OAC's, well, all 235 of them have underfloor A/C's.<br></div></blockquote>Why were they equipped with under-floor A/C? For trial purposes? 9631X on Sv. 12 is a little shocking, isn't it perm on Sv. 17? Ahh, the good old days when 9631X was still with Sv. 56..</div>

I am very sure that as recent as July TIB741C had been spotted on services 811 and 855. 741C is definitely an AMKDEP native.</div>

Of all things they should also have sealed the windows like SBST did with their ex-NAC O405s. Wonder why they were even bought NAC in the first place. At least the a/c compressor could have been installed, like AL1 in HK, and windows opened in prepation for the future regulations. Forgot how it was like to be on an NAC O405, there are none left in SG. A pity.</div>

The rubber sealants are sometimes corroded.<br><br>TIBS has no more NAC buses. It has become a fully air-conditioned bus service company.</div>
