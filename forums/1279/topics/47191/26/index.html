            <div class='col-md body'>For goodness sake just stop all this sort of  "discussions". It is not constructive at all and takes up unnecessary space on the forum (to readers like me). I don't think this is an "interesting find" at all. I want to stress that while different buses can perform differently when left in their <strong>original states</strong>, the speed is still modulated by the speed limiter, which is really the insipid thing. The speed at which the bus goes is also dependent on the driver, which in my opinion, is the actual "rate determining factor". What can you do if the driver of a Scania decides to drive slowly because he is ahead of schedule, or when a VSO <span style="font-style: italic;">chiong</span> and overtake other buses because it is behind schedule?</div>

What i meant was those kinda whirling sound, that gave people the impression that the turbo of the engine is somehow faulty.</div>
