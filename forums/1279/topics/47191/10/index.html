            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, it may be possible. At WLDEP, we found that the driver had to key in 4 numbers, which are normally the same.

It's so long and the bus network is rather bad. Deeper into the neighbourhood and you can find no bus in there.</div></blockquote>Yeah.. Sembawang is the worst. I used to stay there until I was 10 years old. The bus services deteriorated constantly. 160, 161, 164, 167, 169 with 4 services going downtown. Now left only 160 (980) and 167 that are actually services that are useful. The rest are just "token, duplicated and not really useful" services to "hopefully show people that TIBS is taking care of Sembawang". They failed.</div>
