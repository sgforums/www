            <div class='col-md body'>Good question .<br><br>Well what SBST and SMRT are looking for a few factors.<br><br>The most important is the cost of the bus.<br><br>The maintainance cost, the purchase cost and the cost of the spare parts.<br><br>These are the following factors they are looking when evaluating .<br><br>1. Chassis  , low floor body and configuration must suit SBST or SMRt's needs.<br>2. Engine : The engine must be fuel effiency , reliable and enviroment friendly. They are probably looking at Euro 4 engines.<br>3. When it comes to bus types, they will more or less stick to the same brand for example like SBST = Volvo  and SMRT = Mercedes because they are already operating the brand and makes maintainance easier. Unlikely they will get a new type . And some more they get discounts from the companies they purchase most of their buses so this is another plus point why SBST had been buying mainly Volvo buses .<br>4. Tyres : Probably stick to the same company.<br>5. During evaluating the new bus , the following factors must be considered:<br>Is the bus suitable for singapore roads ? Is the engine able to run more then 12 hours per day ?  Is the engine powerful enough to climb up the steep slope with a full load of passengers ? All these are considered during evaluation and there are trials on the new buses before the companines make a decision.<br><br>SBST's choices =  Volvo , Mercedes, Scania  or Dennis (I doubt)<br>SMRT's choices = Mercedes , Scania , Dennis or DAF<br><br>You can't see SBST purchasing DAF buses or SMRT buying Volvo buses.<br><br>There are some areas I have missed out, I hope some bus experts can carry on where I left out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers !<br>Hope this helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They may be cheaper but ultimately don't measure up to the same standards as European buses, then it's still out, as far as a 1st world place like Singapore is concerned, where expensive private car prices leave people with few alternatives to public transport here such that only the best vehicles deserve deployment here ! So that people then have less case to complain of 'lousy' public transport here !<br><br>Buses of european makes don't always have to end up as more expensive than Japanese makes. The largest bus makers in the world like Mercedes-Benz, Saab-Scania etc. have manufacturing &amp; design facilities in cheaper places like Brazil &amp; the models (in whole or in part) from such non-european locations can be very price competitive too with the rest of the world's makes.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Halide:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm...so is SBS 9889U still under evaluation now?

            <div class='col-md body'>Volvo buses are excellent in safety aspects but not for speed,Only a handful can speed and quite confidence in raining days compared to Mercedes,Scanias or other brands.I've ever drive a few Mercs and most of them skidded sideways during hard/Last minutes brakes.Scanias are superb in acceleration but most of the brakes fails.<br><br>I still hopes that SBST Would purchase some Mercedes Diesel besides Volvos.</div>
