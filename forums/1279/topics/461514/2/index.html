              <p><br>Then i will clarify, if you don't like a person's attitude, you ignore. You and your friends don't create unnecessary trouble like last month/previous that can get you implicated - it would have been a long case. Unless you and your friends can come up with very good explainations that can convince the most seasoned lawyers you and your friends actions and words meant no harm - i believe you got see the various online defamation cases in the news, you should know where you and your friends words were heading to in the future.</p>
