              <p>Actually if you ask me i say SBST is smart.BSEP only subsidised the current new bus model that the co buys.So its a win-win situation for them.For the latter delivery they can always opt for another Volvo models or bodyworks.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure why Sv 43 got Citaros, but Sv 5 is because the BCs preferred the Citaros' acceleration on the uphill sections of PIE and also when heading up the steep uphill sliproad to PIE from Jalan Toa Payoh. The KUBs, especially the EEVs were like coughing and downshifting always when doing those parts, even worse during peak hour crowds.</p>
              <p>And the Citaros for Sv 5 did indeed allow the BCs to keep up with their schedule in between stops. Previously the BCs would be stuck at Thomson-Orchard area and then lambat all the way from there cause the KUBs refused to accelerate fast enough. Seriously.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure why Sv 43 got Citaros, but Sv 5 is because the BCs
              preferred the Citaros' acceleration on the uphill sections of PIE
              and also when heading up the steep uphill sliproad to PIE from
              Jalan Toa Payoh. The KUBs, especially the EEVs were like coughing
              and downshifting always when doing those parts, even worse during
              peak hour crowds.</p>
              <p>And the Citaros for Sv 5 did indeed allow the BCs to keep up
              with their schedule in between stops. Previously the BCs would be
              stuck at Thomson-Orchard area and then lambat all the way from
              there cause the KUBs refused to accelerate fast enough.
              Seriously.</p>

              So only Sv 5 get stucked at Thomson - Novena corridor la?
              
              and no.. I take S57 KUB up the Thomson flyover there dun seem to be an issue.. In the first place, what's abt chionging up a slope?
              
              All it takes is a sudden hold up at the top of the slope tat's it.. all the momentum from the acceleration wun allow u to stop in time..
              
              If the timetable cannot match, then it's time for the planners to do a review on the runtime... It's not onto driving into a region that goes into playing w/ road hazards...
