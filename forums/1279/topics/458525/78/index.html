                  I believe this is because LTA is waiting for the construction of Joo Koon Bus
                  Interchange to be completed, so that it can introduce the new bus network of
                  Joo Koon Bus Interchange and implement BSEP to the bus networks of Jurong East
                  and Jurong West, at the same time, since the new bus network of Joo Koon Bus Interchange
                  is likely to have an impact on the bus networks of Jurong East and Jurong West. </span></span></h3>

                  housing areas along Jurong East Street 13 totally do not have any bus stop (bus
                  shelter), needless to mention bus routes. The residents there probably take
                  their bus from Jurong Town Hall Road, Jurong East Central and Boon Lay Way, all
                  of which require them to cross the bridge, which can be very inconvenient,
                  especially to those with difficulty walking. Therefore, there is likely going
                  to be a new bus route going through Jurong East Street 13, connecting residents
                  staying there to Jurong East MRT Station or/and Chinese Garden MRT Station.</span></h3>

                  for the housing areas along Jurong East Street 21 and sections of Toh Guan

                  Chinese Garden MRT station. It is very obvious that there will be adjustments

                  to relieve the load off Jurong East Bus Interchange and Jurong East MRT

                  bus link to Chinese Garden MRT station. </span></h3>

                  housing areas directly north of Lakeside MRT station, along Jurong West Street
                  52/42/41, do not have any bus link to Lakeside MRT station. The most they have
                  is 335 and 334, which both take them to Jurong East Bus Interchange and only
                  335 stops by at Chinese Garden MRT station. The housing areas do not have bus
                  link to the MRT station nearest to them. Therefore, it is very obvious that
                  there will be adjustments made to the bus network there, to provide bus
                  connection to Lakeside MRT station.  </span></h3>

                  for the housing areas along Corporation Road, including the new BTOs which were
                  launched earlier this week, at Boon Lay and Taman Jurong. The bus connection
                  from these housing areas to Lakeside MRT station is either weak or missing (mostly
                  missing). Therefore, there is likely to be some adjustments to the bus networks
                  at Boon Lay and Taman Jurong, to provide bus connection to Lakeside MRT
                  station.</span></h3>

                  fact, LTA has already mentioned that a new BSEP bus route would be introduced
                  at Taman Jurong by the end of 2013, which means in December, since November is
                  ending and there is still no news about it.

                  Ching (roadside) Bus Terminal and looping at Jurong West Street 42. This new
                  bus route may patch up the missing bus links to Lakeside MRT station, from
                  Jurong West Street 52/42/41 and sections of housing areas along Corporation
                  Road at Taman Jurong, although it is unlikely that it will also cover the

                  there is an industrial area at Wenya coming up. There may be new bus route(s)
                  created to serve the Wenya Industrial area, connecting it to Lakeside MRT
                  station, as the Wenya Industrial area is actually nearer to Lakeside MRT

                  which are quite inaccessible, especially to the inner parts of the housing area
                  at Wenya, and since Jalan Bahar is a main road, it is also not safe to cross
                  the road, illegally as the nearest traffic light is so far away from most bus
                  shelters. Therefore, there is likely going to be some adjustments to the bus

                  then, there was a proposal to amend bus route 243 to connect to Pioneer MRT

                  Jurong West Primary School, where the bus route was proposed to re-route to, the

                  route 179 is a very heavily-utilised bus route at Boon Lay Bus Interchange and
                  there are often very long queues for bus route 179 at the bus interchange. When
                  Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, there is a likelihood that bus route 179 will
                  be shifted to originate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange, and use Benoi Road, Upper
                  Jurong Road and the Pan Island Expressway to get to the Nanyang Technological
                  University. Since the Joo Koon industrial area is not as crowded as Boon Lay,
                  and it is only crowded during peak periods when people go to work or go back
                  home, there may be more space at Joo Koon Bus Interchange to accommodate the
                  massive crowd of bus route 179. Also, since it is faster to travel to NTU from
                  Joo Koon Bus Interchange, due to it travelling on mostly high-capacity roads,
                  as compared to its current route from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, travelling
                  times to NTU would be shorter and it would also be easier to maintain and
                  manage the frequency of buses on bus route 179.</span></h3>

                  to say, when the Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, there will be adjustments
                  done. There is likely going to be a totally new bus network at Joo Koon, Tuas
                  and Pioneer(industrial area) when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, as bus routes
                  are adjusted to originate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange and new bus routes are
                  created in the process.</span></h3>

                  improving and creating bus connections to MRT stations, I believe LTA will also
                  consider other key focuses when implementing the BSEP in Jurong West and Jurong
                  East, such as connections to the nearest neighbourhood centre, etc. </span></span></h3>

For Jurong TownHall, they will still have 335, 160 to Jurong East MRT and 198, 178 to Jurong MRT stop on Town Hall Rd. </span></h3>
              <h3><span>For Jurong East St 21, I thought the reason why there is no service today is because it is still not that developed and is developing right now. I could be wrong. </span></h3>

              <h3><span>Theoretically, you are right. I am just trying to understand how the route should be structured. It would still need to call at Jurong East Interchange or maybe the new service from Taman Jurong Terminal.</span></h3>

              <h3><span>Not Likely. Boon Lay is also convenient for these areas. Also has integrated services there unlike Pioneer MRT. Also, you need to note not every HDB hub can be connected to the MRTs to both left and right. I think sv 243 and all the upgrades on it, serve this area really well. Also, Pioneer area cannot manage too many services. Already 241/255/257/179 call at this bus stop and all of them have good frequency. Max one more service that should connect Jurong West St 93.</span></h3>

              <h3><span>Bus route 179 is a very heavily-utilised bus route at Boon Lay Bus Interchange and there are often very long queues for bus route 179 at the bus interchange. When Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens, there is a likelihood that bus route 179 will be shifted to originate from Joo Koon Bus Interchange, and use Benoi Road, Upper Jurong Road and the Pan Island Expressway to get to the Nanyang Technological University. Since the Joo Koon industrial area is not as crowded as Boon Lay, and it is only crowded during peak periods when people go to work or go back home, there may be more space at Joo Koon Bus Interchange to accommodate the massive crowd of bus route 179. Also, since it is faster to travel to NTU from Joo Koon Bus Interchange, due to it travelling on mostly high-capacity roads, as compared to its current route from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, travelling times to NTU would be shorter and it would also be easier to maintain and manage the frequency of buses on bus route 179.</span></h3>

The residents there probably take their bus from Jurong Town Hall Road, Jurong East Central and Boon Lay Way, all of which require them to cross the bridge, which can be very inconvenient, especially to those with difficulty walking. Therefore, there is likely going to be a new bus route going through Jurong East Street 13, connecting residents staying there to Jurong East MRT Station or/and Chinese Garden MRT Station.</span></h3>
              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>Likewise for the housing areas along Jurong East Street 21 and sections of Toh Guan Road, which either do not have any bus route plying along the road or have weak linkage to Jurong East Bus Interchange and Jurong East MRT Station.</span></h3>

              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>Meanwhile, to relieve the load off Jurong East Bus Interchange and Jurong East MRT station, the housing area along Jurong East Street 21 and 24 should also have bus link to Chinese Garden MRT station.</span></h3>

              <h3><span>The housing areas directly north of Lakeside MRT station, along Jurong West Street 52/42/41, do not have any bus link to Lakeside MRT station. The most they have is 335 and 334, which both take them to Jurong East Bus Interchange and only 335 stops by at Chinese Garden MRT station. The housing areas do not have bus link to the MRT station nearest to them. Therefore, it is very obvious that there will be adjustments made to the bus network there, to provide bus connection to Lakeside MRT station.  </span></h3>
              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>Likewise for the housing areas along Corporation Road, including the new BTOs which were launched earlier this week, at Boon Lay and Taman Jurong. The bus connection from these housing areas to Lakeside MRT station is either weak or missing (mostly missing). Therefore, there is likely to be some adjustments to the bus networks at Boon Lay and Taman Jurong, to provide bus connection to Lakeside MRT station.</span></h3>
              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>{In fact, LTA has already mentioned that a new BSEP bus route would be introduced at Taman Jurong by the end of 2013, which means in December, since November is ending and there is still no news about it. According to</span> <span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/hu-ching-bus-terminal/">http://publictransportsg.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/hu-ching-bus-terminal/</a> , it seems that there will be a new BSEP bus route originating from the new Hu Ching (roadside) Bus Terminal and looping at Jurong West Street 42. This new bus route may patch up the missing bus links to Lakeside MRT station, from Jurong West Street 52/42/41 and sections of housing areas along Corporation Road at Taman Jurong, although it is unlikely that it will also cover the section of Boon Lay without bus link to Lakeside MRT station.}</span></h3>
              <h3> </h3>
              <h3><span>Meanwhile, there is an industrial area at Wenya coming up.

              <h3><span>The housing area at Wenya is not directly linked by bus to Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Boon Lay MRT station. The 181 bus route there meanders through Gek Poh Neighbourhood Centre before going to Boon Lay Bus Interchange. The closest the residents have to direct link to Boon Lay Bus Interchange is 172, 199 and 405, which are quite inaccessible, especially to the inner parts of the housing area at Wenya, and since Jalan Bahar is a main road, it is also not safe to cross the road, illegally as the nearest traffic light is so far away from most bus shelters. Therefore, there is likely going to be some adjustments to the bus network in the housing area at Wenya, possibly a new BSEP bus route being introduced to provide feeder bus link to Boon Lay Bus Interchange, from Jurong West Avenue 3.</span></h3>
              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>Meanwhile, certain housing areas along Jurong West Street 65 may have weak bus link to Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Boon Lay MRT station. Likewise for certain housing areas along Jurong West Street 93, which may have weak bus link to Pioneer MRT station and the Boon Lay Integrated Transport Hub. Hence, there may be some adjustments to the bus networks at these areas, to improve bus connection to the nearest MRT station and Boon Lay Bus Interchange, from these housing areas.</span></h3>
              <h3><span> </span></h3>
              <h3><span>Similar to Lakeside MRT station, there is also likely to be some adjustments done to provide bus connection to the Wenya Industrial area, from Boon Lay MRT station.</span></h3>
