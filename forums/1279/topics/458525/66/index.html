              <p>195 is a popular route - doing that could inconvenience a lot of
              people. 120 could follow the route above that I am suggesting as it
              connects areas in Redhill, Tanglin Halt, Margaret Dr and Tehlok
              Blangah where there is no or just 1 alternative service. </p>
              <p>If they want to keep 120 with its current routing, I suggest

              <p>I agree with you about service 120. LTA and PTO should revise
              the route again. The bus is totally empty during off peak and less
              than 10 pax on the bus during peak hours. That is not a good sign.
              We want 120 to be utilized  but the problem is LTA  and
              the PTO did not plan the route properly,that's why they need to
              amend the route. Totally waste of  resources as what've you
              mentioned on your post. It's already 5 months since 120 has been
              launched but yet,the loading is unacceptable and not even up to
              standard. Do you realised that the housing estate that 120 route
              ply is a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> low quality housing estate area</span>. Telok Blangah and Bukit
              Merah,is one examples of <span style="color: #ff0000;">low quality housing estate area</span> that have
              less people living around the estate area. And I also pity the

                  have been planned better. 141 for sure. This route connects so many
                  MRT yet the loading is not that great. They decided to terminate at
                  Lor 1 which is really stupid decision. The loading for 141 is more
                  between Pei Koi Estate and Toa Payoh as it is exclusive to this
                  area. Had they extended the route there would have been more

              <p>There are many senior citizens in these old estates served by 120. The nearest major access to amenities is at Bukit Merah. To make this route attractive it may have to be extended to Geylang Lorong 1, or at least go through Chinatown. (It could even merge with 141, but that would cause reliability issues.)</p>
              <p>For 120 to end short of the CBD area is a real pity. There is little incentive for passengers making any MRT transfers with this route.</p>
              <p>LTA has the numbers to figure out which routes will become popular or unpopular, and they have even gone to the extent of making a video telling the public that they have loading factors to consider and cannot please everyone.</p>
              <p>Which leaves us one last remaining factor: Politics may have come into play.</p>

              <p>There are many senior citizens in these old estates served by
              120. The nearest major access to amenities is at Bukit Merah. To
              make this route attractive it may have to be extended to Geylang
              Lorong 1, or at least go through Chinatown. (It could even merge
              with 141, but that would cause reliability issues.)</p>
              <p>For 120 to end short of the CBD area is a real pity. There is
              little incentive for passengers making any MRT transfers with this
              route.</p>
              <p>LTA has the numbers to figure out which routes will become
              popular or unpopular, and they have even gone to the extent of
              making a video telling the public that they have loading factors to
              consider and cannot please everyone.</p>
              <p>Which leaves us one last remaining factor: Politics may have
              come into play.</p>

              <p>I won't even want to speculate why 120 has become the "hot topic" here.</p>
              <p>Already clearly there is more than meets the eyes, but the forum members here have been rather naive to say the least.</p>
              <p>There's too many unknowns as to why 120 is like this. Best not to speculate too much.</p>
              <p>On that note, on one hand LTA wishes to reach out to public. On the other hand, the public has yet to feel empowered where route-creations are concerned. Perhaps its time for less opaqueness?</p>

              <p>My opinon is that it is not if, but when such a merger would occur.</p>
              <p>A small surprise was that the CEO of SMRT <a href="http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/smrt-confident-turning-loss-incurring-bus-business-around">prefers the competitive tendering model</a>. ComfortDelGro is traditionally much stronger on this field, given CDG's previous experience from Metroline and CDG CabCharge.</p>
              <p>One well-known risk in competitive tendering is that you could undercut to gain an advantage in securing the contract, but undercut too much and you could well go under. Two construction projects tendered by LTA were halted halfway because the contractor went bust - Alpine Bau (DTL) and L&amp;M Prestressing (West Coast Highway).</p>
