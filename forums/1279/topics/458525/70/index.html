              <p>It takes only 5-10 mins from Sengkang to Tampines, is it??? And
              why are you even comparing it to 161 and 168 both that are full
              fleet DDs??</p>
              <p>Have you tried standing in a crowded 27 Citaro all the way on
              TPE to Tampines or the other way around? I would never take a 27 to
              Tampines, rather prefer to drive down. There are many who do not
              opt for 27 in the first place because they dont want their balls to
              be pressed against someone elses!!</p>

              <p>Agree, standing on 161, 168 or 858 is better than standing on 27 despite the longer distance.</p>
              <p>27 is usually crowded to the door. On a KUB, when the driver brakes hard you will see people falling onto you, while boarding a Citaro is like squeezing into a box of sardines. I think B10M is really the most suited bus for 27, didn't use to have that much of a problem in the past.</p>

              <p>With B10M, seating space is more, but standing is again an issue - so almost can take same # of pax like a crowded KUB. I would really think LTA has done a great job when it relieves the load on some of the CGA services that are so packed.</p>
              <p>I know so many people will not take 27 for its reputation of being crowded inspite of the frequency. 161, 168 even if you have to stand it is after 82 pax have a seat - that means normally during peak only 8-10 pax would be standing - which not ideal, but still comfortable. 27 only 30-34 pax can sit and rest 35 pax squeeze into the aisle.

              <p>But more seating warrants more safety. </p>

              <p>Same goes for the Citaros. The narrow and twisting aisle often trips standing pax. And the BC likes to "bully" the Citaros too. Stepping on the accelerator to full thrust and then suddenly jerk into the bus bay. Damn!</p>

              <p>I hope LTA and SBST can look into this service. You have a bus that comes after a half hour and three buses following it, near empty. 27 is still popular despite the convenience of driving, thanks to its fast route and well-planned transfers. CGA workers rely on it too. Due to its, on average, frequent frequency, people choose 27 &gt; 34 when travelling to Tampines. </p>

              <p>What is left is DDs. Hence, to make the journey comfortable, SBST/LTA need to deploy DDs on 27 from Hougang to Tampines Ave 4 (Century Square) and can start 27E to CGA from Hougang that will only stop at important stops.</p>

              <p>People from CGA choose 27 or 34 depending on which one takes them closer to their destination in Tampines. If I live on Tampines Ave 2, I would not take a 27 but would rather wait for a 34.</p>
              <p>But I agree, if it is stops like Tampines Interchange or Bef TPE, I would consider taking a 27 than 34.</p>

              <p>But its frequency is not consistent at all!</p>
              <p>This is the disadvantage of having more small buses than less larger buses. Sometimes I wait for a half hour and sometimes I wait as short as 20 seconds. And this is also why I have given up on iris for svc 27. By having DDs less SDs can be used and in turn the BCs would stop racing their way throughout the route. But if course, it remains impossible for now. </p>

              <p><br>And that's where the biggest problem for sv 27 comes in. The buses often bunch up due to high frequency and the fact that it loops at CGA.</p>
              <p>From HCI to CGA is fine (bunching is less) but on the way back it is catastrophic at times.</p>
              <p>I have spotted many times 5 sv 27 buses in a span of 05 mins. Some of them are buses that bunch from HCI--&gt;CGA and come back, while others are downroutes that start from Century Square.</p>
              <p>To SMB128B's point, when this happens, imagine there must have been a big gap before. Hence, the first bus that comes, people crowd in like sardines - same thing happens for 2nd bus, making people really irritated. The other buses go at sub-optimal loading.</p>
              <p>This can be totally avoided if you deploy DDs at a frequency of say 05 mins. You use less fuel, less BC, less road space, give more seating space to passengers. So many advantages over deploying double the # of SDs to make it like a DD.</p>

                  into the bus bay. Damn!</p>
                  <p>A few months ago I took a crowded B10M on 27, none of these
                  happened. </p>
                  <p>I hope LTA and SBST can look into this service. You have a bus
                  that comes after a half hour and three buses following it, near
                  empty. 27 is still popular despite the convenience of driving,
                  thanks to its fast route and well-planned transfers. CGA workers
                  rely on it too. Due to its, on average, frequent frequency, people
                  choose 27 &gt; 34 when travelling to Tampines. </p>
