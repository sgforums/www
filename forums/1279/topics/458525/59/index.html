              <p>119, 153, 163M, 228, 62A, 101, 56 and 186.</p>
              <p>As for 62A, the route should be from aljunied station to punggol and not punggol to aljunied station.. furthermore it operates after peak hours.</p>
              <p>As for 101.. they should have tried 101A from HCI to Buangkok Link.. Furthermore they are using citaros.. which cannot handle huge loads compared to a KUB.</p>
              <p>As for 186, the SDs come at most fully seated.</p>
              <p>As for 119, peak hours empty, school hours maybe fully seated?</p>
              <p>As for 163M, no one bothers to move up, all crowd downstairs.</p>
              <p>As for 56 and 153, SD dosent even get full.</p>
              <p>As for 228, dds should be given to 60 instead.. more pax take 60 than 228.</p>
              <p> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I would like to save myself from explaining the unstable loads of 43. U should go and look up on 43's load. Its has been mentioned many times.</span></p>

              <p>Is 113/A load so empty? </p>

                              113's not gonna get Citaros to handle the increasing load at Kovan.
                              And KUBs are out of the question for SBST. So no harm putting 1 or
                              2 DDs on trial for 113A? If really cannot then use SD
                              loh. </p>

              <p>113A always bunch with 113 but can be quite packed also. If DDs are introduced can reduce trips of 113A or can downroute from HCI. I have asked several commuters if they will move up if 113 has dds, most of them said yes because of the slow loading at kovan station itself.. </p>
              <p>The only thing i know to get back home without squeezing is taking 113 at 6.50pm from kovan station, 113A and 113 come together.. Furthermore the 113 that comes is SBS921T, more seats.</p>

              <p>56 agreed.</p>
              <p>228: Wrong location bro. 60 doesn't ply the east side of Bedok Reservior. And that's where 228 gets its precious heavy load. And you should see the variety of people taking that svc. From residents of nearby condos and HDBs to heartlanders around the shopping area there (forgot blk number) and even occasional sporting guys from Bedok Reservoir. Again not fully loaded DD, but also not empty either. And it's not a lot too. </p>

              <p>Then if that's the case, 269 should get DD first, not 113. Somehow or rather, I don't find a need for 113 to get DD. </p>
              <p>Anyway, 163M only gets DD Cameo, not perm. I don't see why it's an issue to get cameo. 119's DD are all under BSEP, not part of the initial 6 buses. Even if they remove the 2 DDs, they can't place it on ur 113[unless 113 is part of BSEP].</p>

              <p>153 has freq headways up to 20 minutes.. </p>
              <p>SD can handle loads already..</p>
              <p>Most of 228's route got svc 60.. Maybe svc 60 pax will seek 228
              as an alternative? But so far alot of ppl think 228 dun need dds..
              Just need SWTs.. look at 60.</p>
              <p>62A - Lots of indian workers, but SD come wont full leh. I think
              they should deploy SD instead, save resources.  Go see 103..
              then compare 62.</p>
              <p>163 can afford to cut 1-2 dds lah.. Sometimes dd cameo on 163M
              dunno for wad</p>

              <p>62A: Then prove the DDs can be better utilised on 62. Or other svcs nearby. "off-peak" what!</p>
              <p>228: A lot of ppl... Who? I was a half-frequent commuter myself at Bedok Reservoir. People cram onto svc 228 all the same like what they do when 66 comes. And since 66 uses some Citaros, the leftovers will have to board 228. Imagine if 228 came first. </p>
              <p>103 doesn't need DDs. I have observed 103 at Jln Kayu several times. Even with jams, 103 can cope well with SDs, with standees nearly up to the door. Unfortunately 103 can't use DDs, sad loh.</p>
              <p>153: You observe 153 then talk to me. Evidence? Toa Payoh. Where &gt;50 pax alight from feeders and other trunks and transfer to this svc at Lor 4 along with the residents there. Reason? Sole service to HG Ctrl. Another of TPY's senior citizens' favourite. Want more? Whitley Rd. Upper deck 75% seated and downstairs fully seated. What LTA loves to see. </p>
              <p>163/M: Not necessary to cut DDs from 163 just to limit DD cameos on 163M. You can always limit it to KUBs doing 163M. Maybe can make 2 DDs on 163 full day and the rest spilt? </p>
