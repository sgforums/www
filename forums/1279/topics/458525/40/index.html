              <p>Then they can just boost the fleet with split shift buses, and instead of BSEP, can use normal buses already mah? If I am not wrong, the BSEP bus operates on full day(until 7/8). Isn't it much fuel saving then to have more extra buses running on peak hours instead of full day? </p>

              <p>Took 860 3-4 times recently. On way to Khatib, it is the only bus, so full. On return, 800 is there from Khatib MRT. Why will people take 860 that will go to Ave 3, then turn to Ave 2 and then back to Ring road. Distance fare more.</p>
              <p>People rather wait for 800 and take 800 to Ring road instead. So 860 on return journey is not that full. The route should have complemented 800 and should have just returned to Yishun Interchange from Ring Road. This way 860 downward frequency to Khatib would be very good.</p>

              <p>But look at svc 4 and svc 50 - loading is good. I am just saying, the routing should have been thought about better. 120 hardly 20 pax in the bus during peak hours. 124 takes most load to Harbourfront. If 33 has gone ahead, 120 completely empty to Redhill.</p>

              <p>That's the problem~ They should extend the changing of sleeper's time. For example, since weekdays there's hardly people travelling around 11-12, they can close certain station that's hardly use(like Kranji/Marsiling - Marsiling have some direct buses). Otherwise, they can deploy shuttle buses at night to meet the deadline. Of cus they have to pay abit extra to the drivers~</p>
              <p>With shorter time to replace the rail track, the time taken to change all of them would take lesser time. By then, if they need to, they should do a full test on the lines-for example team A do Station A to C, team B will do Station C to E etc.- after completing the whole track replacement to ensure that the newest and new track sleeper would have no flaws or problem.</p>
              <p>By doing so every week after the entire replacement, they can prevent less breakdowns etc(Of cus to check the other parts too). They can also hire some experts to team up with the crew to ensure strict maintenace. That will benefit more to the people and the funds are used correctly(Funds for drivers' extra work, recruit the experts etc.) </p>
              <p>Station facilities, they can add more seats to the platform(if possible) or otherwise, add 1-2 more TVs on each platform. </p>
              <p>I would ask you then, does the frequency of 925 become shorter? I still see the same-1 bus in and another out, 10mins later another bus enter and another bus leaves. They added 2 BSEP and the fleet turn out to be not efficient(in frequency). I'm not sure about the effect of the 3 BSEP but I can say 925's 1st wave of BSEP was useless. They only foresee the load in the interchange itself and forgotten about Marsiling/Kranji station. Never observe how the 3 BSEP bus affects the service, but I believe that the frequency is shorter(obvious, provided they didn't remove any buses) and making it useful. With just 2 and the frequency is about the same, I don't find it useful~</p>
