              <p>Get over it.</p>
              <p>I have already pointed out that besides the couple of people who
              keep seeing problems with 113, the rest of us don't seem terribly
              interested, which does suggest that 113 is not facing problems that
              are unique to it.</p>
              <p>And dont forget.</p>
              <p>You misrepresented people like myself who do take 113 to get to
              HG Ave 8. And when I pointed out that what you claim is a
              far-fetched argument as we have at least 3 alternatives to get
              there, you accused me of being selfish (haha!).</p>
              <p>So its your fault for giving me ammunition to shoot you down.
              ^^v</p>
              <p>Please lah. Grow up!</p>

              <p>If it isnt that full, would the bus captain skip bus stops? If it isnt that full, he will stop and ask pax to move in. As in the video, even thou it is not so clear, the bus is full with 2 rows of people formed at the back and with people squeezing at the front door. </p>
              <p>SBST now dunno wad they doing also. Instead of adding freq they add dds. Some svc dont need dd also put. Then all those that need dd dw put.</p>

              <p>If that's the case you may as well remove 43's DDs alr. </p>
              <p>You can't assume the reasons above. Becoz well, the BC can always check the rear. And he WOULD force everyone to move behind before leaving the stop. And yes, the pax WILL move. I've seen enough of Tampines Townlinks and I know what will people do. For your second reason, why would people not move, if that moving means less squeeze along the corridor? Even if it's not so, 27 is crowded enough, I'm sure everybody knows, and guess what? 90% of the skip-stop 27s I was on was actually kinda spacious in the middle. So why 27 still gets 32 buses, daily cameos and downroutes? You know. </p>
              <p>Reason why I used the comparison in the first line is becoz I find 43's spot loading very similar to 113's. That's because 43 also has very high loading in some sectors, and very empty buses in some sectors where there are other alt services too. But 43 got DDs all the same. It's being around a year since the DDs are on 43 now, and if it means 43 deserve DDs for good, then why not 113? I mean, of course not full day, but maybe 1 DD for school hours, and maybe 2-3 DDs for 113A. That should be okay, I guess. </p>

Sooner or later,they have to decide what they want to do to 113. Either,they put DD buses into 113 or maybe add in more buses to 113/113A to cope with the high loading or maybe can just improve on the frequency. It's up to them,their choice,they have to decide what's the best way for commuters to have a comfortable ride throughout their journey on 113</p></div>

              <p>Unfortuanately, some BCs don't..</p>
              <p>Yes people will move, but they will never move to the rear,
              fully to the rear. It's always damn frustrating that people often
              leave a big gap.</p>
              <p>What I felt... If you pump more buses on a trunk and feeder,
              obviously the feeder can benefit more as the distance is short,
              jams may not occur that much.<br> <br> But if you pump more buses on service like 43, long distance, and
              if it happens that one of the sector[mostly mid-journey] jam, how
              are you going to handle the load? It's not as easy as pulling out
              extra bus to cover from terminals.</p>

              <p>You should see 113's route. 113 plies one of the roads that can give all motorists nightmares during PM peak: Upp Serangoon Rd. YOU tell me HOW that road won't jam. If it won't jam I wouldnt need to be so fucked during the June NEL breakdown alr. Basically dead-minded SBST INSISTED ALL SHUTTLES on taking Upp Serangoon Rd to cater to the few Harbourfront-bound passengers. What happens in the end? All the buses got jammed there. Haiz. You tell me 113 won't jam? Hah I gotta laugh man. </p>
              <p>43 have ADDs serving its short-trips. And yes, it settled 43's load well. So why not for 113A? </p>
