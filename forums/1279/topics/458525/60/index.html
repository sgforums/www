              <p>62A: Then prove the DDs can be better utilised on 62. Or other
                      svcs nearby. "off-peak" what!</p>
              <p>228: A lot of ppl... Who? I was a half-frequent commuter myself
                      at Bedok Reservoir. People cram onto svc 228 all the same like what
                      they do when 66 comes. And since 66 uses some Citaros, the
                      leftovers will have to board 228. Imagine if 228 came
                      first. </p>
              <p>103 doesn't need DDs. I have observed 103 at Jln Kayu several
                      times. Even with jams, 103 can cope well with SDs, with standees
                      nearly up to the door. Unfortunately 103 can't use DDs, sad
                      loh.</p>
              <p>153: You observe 153 then talk to me. Evidence? Toa Payoh. Where
                      &gt;50 pax alight from feeders and other trunks and transfer to
                      this svc at Lor 4 along with the residents there. Reason? Sole
                      service to HG Ctrl. Another of TPY's senior citizens' favourite.
                      Want more? Whitley Rd. Upper deck 75% seated and downstairs fully
                      seated. What LTA loves to see. </p>
              <p>163/M: Not necessary to cut DDs from 163 just to limit DD cameos
                      on 163M. You can always limit it to KUBs doing 163M. Maybe can make
                      2 DDs on 163 full day and the rest spilt? </p>

              <p>Eh, i am a frequent commuter of 62,103 and 153.</p>
              <p>U really think the amount of indian workers taking 62 is more than 103?</p>
              <p>62's schedule is messed up. AM Peak every 4min 1 bus comes (coming from paya lebar) when the load is going towards paya lebar.</p>
              <p>Have u seen the queues for 103? 103 dosent need to have dd, but need to have better frequency.</p>
              <p>I myself have taken 153 from work daily at RTC and the SDs seem to be coping well. It is the jam at toa payoh flyover towards braddell road that waste alot of time, even if that's the case, the SD is not even full. 50 pax a kub come also wont full la deh. Putting dds on 153 is to let us commuters to enjoy the ride in comfort, but in reality, the dds arent fully "utilised" as even SD come, also not full.</p>

              <p>Do you see the weekend loading without 269A? AFAIK, 269's KUB would depart with full loading, during the 128 crossovers period. And it's only the sector until the market. </p>

Why is there a need to waste resources by deploy DD on 113? Even 113A isn't a need, such a short sector. I'm sure if 113A were to u-turn around the Kovan Station with 10-15mins interval, there's no need to fleet add 113.</p>

              <p>119, 153, 163M, 228, 62A, 101, 56 and 186.</p>
              <p>As for 62A, the route should be from aljunied station to punggol
              and not punggol to aljunied station.. furthermore it operates after
              peak hours.</p>
              <p>As for 101.. they should have tried 101A from HCI to Buangkok
              Link.. Furthermore they are using citaros.. which cannot handle
              huge loads compared to a KUB.</p>
              <p>As for 186, the SDs come at most fully seated.</p>
              <p>As for 119, peak hours empty, school hours maybe fully
              seated?</p>
              <p>As for 163M, no one bothers to move up, all crowd
              downstairs.</p>
              <p>As for 56 and 153, SD dosent even get full.</p>
              <p>As for 228, dds should be given to 60 instead.. more pax take 60
              than 228.</p>
