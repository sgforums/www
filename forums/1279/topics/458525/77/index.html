              <p>Nope. Strange. But i saw 6 buses on 113 today only.. 5010-5013,

              change the ETT and nothing is implemented. Maybe have to wait for
              evening peak hours? if not then i think they change ett for fun. As

              <p>Agree on both 119 and 325. 325 loop via HG Ave 2 makes few people take it except those who transfer to other services at HG Ave 2. Bus almost always leaves interchange with just 15-25 pax during peak and most will alight at HG Ave 2. Again at the MRT stop on HG Ave 10, you will see 25-30 pax boarding during PM peak - but that's about it.</p>
              <p>AM peak loading &gt; PM peak. PM peak I agree that most people just wait for 101 that almost covers most of 325's route faster. Also, with recent upgrade on 101, more incentive for people to take it.</p>
              <p>325 should be modified to start at HG St 21.</p>

              <p>I have noticed a reduce in runtime and rest time for bcs of sv 113. Why must save resources and make bcs suffer? If sbst can upgrade 101 and 119 i dont think why sbs transit cant do the same. </p>
              <p>Agree on 325's part. I have been to 325's looping point and buangkok green bus stop and i observed that only 5-10 pax board the bus even though 325 came first. Pax rather wait for 72 which is only a 10 min ride to HCI than a 20min ride to HCI.

              <p>Repeating again: The only reason 113 has not got DDs is because, DDs are a complete waste between Kovan and HG Int because of its routing. This sector during peak hours also will not get more than 40 pax. Like we say for 119, people will say for 113, whose loading is worse than 119 between Kovan and Hougang.</p>
              <p>The peak loading for 119 is at Rivervale where during AM peak, loading can reach 60-65 pax and PM peak loading is around 50-55 pax. For 113, peak loading never exceeds beyond 40 pax b/w Kovan and Hougang.</p>
              <p>The sector from Kovan to Lor Ah Soo is the one where 113 loading can exceed 70 pax. Now they will not deploy DDs only for this bit of the route. If they do, they should do crossover from services 89/107/153 that have done their peak route from CBD or Changi Cargo to HG and will go off-service to depot. Just like sv 90 buses do one service of 139A before going off-service.</p>

              <p><br>Ofcourse every route does not need DDs but if a route has 65-70+ pax, putting a DD is worth it, if you want to provide a good travel to people. Otherwise you really have to cram in.</p>
              <p><strong>Some statistics</strong>:</p>
              <p>Apr 2012: 1054 DD, 1637 SD (<strong>39.08%</strong> of fleet DD)</p>
              <p>Sep 2013: 1215 DD, 1701 SD (<strong>41.67%</strong> of fleet DD).</p>
              <p>This is only counting perm deployed DDs/SDs - does not include SP buses, special buses such as CT18.</p>
              <p>If you observe, there is a remarkable increase in fleet of both DD and SD, but DDs have far exceeded the # of SDs deployed on services. SBST should aim for a 50-50 distribution in the next 2 years.</p>

              <p>BSEP WEGs that are SP belong to AMDEP, BNDEP, BBDEP. No SLBP yet unless they give the new WEG to SLBP and do depot transfer. Again depends on what Taman Jurong service routing is to see if it needs DD. If the route is like 120/141, hell no need.</p>

              <p>I guess it has a good load at Alexandra Road, since it parallels with 33 and 64 to Tiong Bahru Road (Redhill MRT). The other side, however, is not used by many passengers at all. I guess I can only see a good load at Alexandra Road... Otherwise, I don't really see the benefit of 120 much...</p>

              <p><br>Honestly, if that is the purpose of sv 120, it is complete BS (bull shit). 33/64 can manage the load well. You have 195 to Queenstown as well. If 33 has called Alexandra Shopping Ctr, and 120 follows, you will see it goes empty.</p>

              <p><br>Do they!? I don't see them always crowded. 33 fleet is fine la... Why more buses!?</p>
              <p>Anyway, 120 route between Alexandra Road and Redhill is fine. The rotue needs to be modified between Redhill and NBR Terminal, Alexandra Road and Tehlok Blangah. In these areas, the bus has single digit pax most of the time, except for few peak hour time slots.</p>
