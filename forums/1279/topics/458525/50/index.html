              <p>it was almost very first batch of BSEP service.. is it enough?? frankly speaking, if they put DD, or bendy, then can increase the capacity...  but they keep on adding normal bus and then tell the world that they are losing money and want to exit the bus business.</p>

              <p>Quite honestly, having studied SMRT's routing, I think it is not surprising that they are bochap about their buses.</p>
              <p>Feeder services are notorious for been low on fuel efficiency. Look at the ratio of feeder against trunk for SMRT, and compare to SBST. 40% of routes from SMRT are feeder. Cost of operation will surely be adversely affected.</p>
              <p>SMRT buses in general also run significantly higher mileages than SBST ones, probably because of the depot locations in relation to where the trunk services run. Cost of operation lagi jialat.</p>
              <p>Worse.</p>
              <p>Look at the buses they have purchased. Lagi cham. Expensive buses with significantly higher running costs.</p>
              <p>And now? Want to turn SMRTB around? Hard la.</p>
              <p>But please la, no more bendies. </p>
              <p>Stop making the situation worse.</p>
              <p>I think it is VERY clear that LTA is unhappy with bendies.</p>
              <p>It is very very clear already when it was announced that subsequent depots to be built by govt. Quite unlikely bendy provisions will be encouraged at least.</p>
              <p>SMRT is already threatening to pull out of bus operations when their license is up at 2016. I dont think that is unlikely given SMRT's current situation.</p>

              <p>very true... even that 3 stars chief think that the new pricing model (city direct route) by Govt will be working on these normal routes? i dun think Govt will be paying SMRT a fixed amount to run these normal routes which guarantee them profit... it is best that SMRT exit the buses business since they cant manage it properly..... how can they lose around S$100 k daily just on normal bus operation?</p>
