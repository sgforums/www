              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>• About half of 550 buses under BSEP added on the road<br> • 111 existing bus services improved<br> • Waiting times on popular services shortened by 3 to 5 minutes<br> • 40% reduction in number of bus services with persistent crowding during peak hours<br> • Improved connectivity with 14 new bus services</strong></p>
              <p>1. About 248 new buses under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme 
              (BSEP), nearly half of the 550 buses committed, have been added on the 
              road in the first year of the programme, launched in September 2012.</p>
              <p>2. In total, 111 existing bus services have been enhanced and 14 new 
              bus services introduced. These improvements have enhanced the 
              connectivity of the bus network, shortened waiting times by 3 to 5 
              minutes for some existing bus services, and reduced the number of bus 
              services with persistent crowding during peak periods from 96 to 56, or 
              by about 40%.</p>
              <p>3. The bulk of the remaining BSEP buses will be rolled out by the end 
              of 2014, instead of 2016. Indeed, by end 2014, another 200 buses will 
              have been added to further improve existing services and for new 
              services.</p>
              <p>4. Mr Yeo Teck Guan, the Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) Group 
              Director for Public Transport, said, “We have been monitoring the 
              performance of the BSEP services closely. Commuters are already 
              experiencing tangible and perceptible improvements in bus services and 
              feedback has been positive. Some have cited shorter waiting times while 
              others have experienced less crowded buses. This is a good thing. We are
               aware that there are still areas in our bus services that need 
              improvement, we hope to further enhance connectivity and raise service 
              levels as we roll out more BSEP buses in the upcoming quarters.”</p>
              <p>5. SBS Transit CEO, Mr Gan Juay Kiat said, "Since September last year, 
              we have introduced seven new bus services, extended one bus route and 
              made improvements on 77 bus services. We have stepped up delivery of new
               buses and recruited more Bus Captains. We are heartened by the positive
               feedback from our commuters. We will continue to work at improving our 
              services to better meet their needs."</p>
              <p>6. Vice President of SMRT Buses Ltd, Mr Tan Kian Heong said, “Under the
               BSEP, SMRT has in the past year injected more than 75 new buses to 
              expand our bus service network, reduce crowdedness and improve the 
              frequencies of our bus services. These results are an encouraging 
              testament to successful government and industry partnership. We look 
              forward to rolling out more services in the years to come, to connect 
              residents to key transport nodes and other destinations in the city 
              areas.”</p>
              <p><strong>Existing bus services improved</strong></p>
              <p>7. Improvements in the form of additional buses and hence capacity were made to 111<a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=90ed2342-709e-4c64-be26-be8898ecd383#1"><sup><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1</span></sup></a> existing bus services with heavy ridership, or 2 in every 5 basic bus services<a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=90ed2342-709e-4c64-be26-be8898ecd383#2"><sup>2</sup></a>. These improvements benefit many commuters as the services are geographically spread island-wide.</p>
              <p>8. BSEP also enabled these services to operate at shorter intervals and
               commuters now experience shorter waiting times. SBS Transit Service 
              335, for example, now runs at an improved frequency of 7 to 8 minutes 
              during the morning peak and 7 to 9 minutes during the evening peak 
              periods. The service previously ran at a frequency of 9 to 11 minutes 
              during the morning peak, and about 10 to 13 minutes during the evening 
              peak.</p>
              <p>9. About 40 bus services are also now less crowded based on analysis of
               ticketing and GPS data. These include SMRT’s Service 106, which has 
              seen peak hour crowding come down by about 15%.</p>
              <p><strong>Better connectivity with new bus services</strong></p>
              <p>10. 14 new BSEP bus services<sup><a href="http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&amp;id=90ed2342-709e-4c64-be26-be8898ecd383#3">3</a></sup> have been introduced to improve bus connectivity, with 13 operated by 
              the public transport operators (PTOs), and one operated by a private bus
               operator (the Jurong West City Direct Bus Service 651 launched today).</p>
              <p>11. Mr Willy Wong, 54, self-employed, is one of the commuters who have 
              benefitted from the new bus services. Commenting on the new SBS Transit 
              Service 50, he said: “The new service gives me an alternative bus route 
              to travel from my house to Sengkang MRT station and Compass Point. It is
               more direct than the existing Service 163 so it brings more convenience
               to residents in the Fernvale area like me.”</p>
              <p>12. SMRT’s parallel Service 850E that connects Yishun to the CBD has 
              also been well received by commuters. The operator has doubled the 
              number of morning trips to four to cater to the high ridership.</p>
              <p>13. By the end of 2013, two more new services will be implemented to 
              further improve connectivity in areas like Taman Jurong and Bukit 
              Panjang. Details of these new bus services are being worked out. We will
               provide more information closer to the implementation dates.</p>
              <p>14. Tapping further on private bus operators to augment the PTOs’ 
              resources, 9 more new City Direct bus services will be progressively 
              rolled out from January next year. Apart from these, LTA will also work 
              with private bus operators to operate short services during peak hours, 
              such as localised routes in estates that bring residents to a nearby 
              transport node. These services will complement the existing feeder bus 
              services operated by the PTOs. LTA will call tenders for these short 
              services from the third quarter of this year for progressive 
              implementation from 2014.</p>
