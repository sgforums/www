              <p>Big problem is height restrictions, so they shouldn't have used
              the basement. Or at least construct the basement higher. They can
              also have constructed an open top ground terminal, or on a raised
              level. This would allow DDs to ply on CGA routes. </p>

              <p>Perhaps is due to SG's size and CGA's distance from the city too (NOT BLAMING ANYONE/ANYTHING AH DON'T FLAME ME HOR)</p>
              <p>That's why the taxis are cheaper than many other countries. And it leaves the buses to the locals. However, there are still good alternatives for the buses to stop at. HK for example has a terminal for the buses at the ground floor without having to interfere with the main drop-off points. Walking/taking skytrains between terminals doesn't kill you, especially with all the comfortable connections in CGA. </p>
              <p>Yes, I agree on how the infrastructure could not have been predicted in the past, but maybe there could be a bus terminal at one of the CGA's terminals to cater to the pax? In that case then services like 27 and perhaps 53 can use DDs, and thus will allow more reliable operations. </p>

              <p><br>The entire purpose of having MRT parallel services is a hoax if you put SDs on it that can seat only 30-35 pax. Who would want to stand all the way to CBD from Yishun, Woodlands, CCK?</p>

              <p>Eventually people on these stops will give 951E and will return to 901+MRT. To encourage people to change their travel mode, you have to give them incentive.</p>
              <p>If you put SD, and people see they have to stand all the way, they will go back to MRT. If people wait for the bus, and the bus does not even stop at their bus stop, they for sure will switch back to MRT.</p>

              <p>Look at what was done with 513. It started with 35-40 pax on each bus and people said "why are we deploying DDs on day 1 of this service?" But because people were assured a seat, more people converted from 291--&gt; MRT to 513 and today each bus takes between 65-80 pax. They have not even had to add buses as the DDs are taking care of the loading.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, 850E go on adding buses as people don't want to board a bus with 50-60 people and stand all the way. And then we say "why are they losing money?" If you keep on adding buses, you use more funds for fuel, BC, operations, ERP - leave alone adding to the traffic.</p>
              <p>LTA should stop this territorial thing for the sake of commuters and should give WEGs to 190 and Express services from SMRT area.</p>

              <p><br>Yes bro, of course there will be improvement. If you bring in one more service 990, there will be still more improvement - but it is at a huge cost of additional resources, which could have been mitigated by other alternatives.</p>

              <p>Standing in MRT is same as standing in bus??? </p>
              <p>Regarding timing, when you want to go to office, most people want to reach office around the same time. Hence, AM peak issue more than PM peak. Even if you give a range, normally the buses that reach CBD around 8.30 am have the most pax. These trips you need high capacity buses. And to my point to reduce resources used, you don't deploy 4 of them in the first place.</p>
              <p>And with you, I am not going to get into a discussion of bendy v/s DD. It is better if they get DDs, if they don't want to - better to get some kind of higher capacity bus than nothing at all. </p>
