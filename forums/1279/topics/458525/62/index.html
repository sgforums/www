              <p>113 should maintain its current route cause school students depend on this bus svc to get home, especially serangoon sec side, CHIJ primary and punggol pri. Also, i have seen several commuters utilising this bus service from HG Ave 8 to kovan instead of a 10min walk to hg mall bus stop to wait for 82 to kovan or 119 to kovan.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, if 113 can cut short following 107's route to kovan also good lah cause can save 2km distance fare, attracting more ppl to queue up at HCI and take this bus svc instead.</span></p>
              <p>Bus stops only got buses to HCI at upp serangoon road and hg ave 8 only got 74 and 147. 113 is needed to make sure that there is a bus every 10 mins at least to HCI.</p>
              <p>113 should have a system like 179A that skips several bus stops and use shortcuts to reach peak bus stops such as kovan station.</p>
              <p>The prob is.. schedule too tight, buses always go off schedule. What can SBST do with only 7 buses for a 16.7KM route? </p>
              <p>As for HCI, not every bus is empty. At times i can see fully seated 113. Esp rainy days. I have seen queues as long as 325's one but not as 161/27.</p>
              <p>113 can have the dds from 119 cause the load from kovan is huge. Loading alr takes 5 minutes itself. Off peak most of the load come from hougang st 21 fc bus stop. Peak hour load mostly from kovan station itself.</p>

              <p><br>Can we stop discussing sv113? You keep insisting 113 has lot of loading between Kovan and HCI but sorry not more than 20-30 pax almost at most times, and you still want DDs deployed for full route??</p>
              <p><strong>Anyway, let's stop discussing sv 113. Lot of other services to discuss. </strong>Don't you think we have explored all options here and still beating around the bush.</p>

              <p>If it isnt that full, would the bus captain skip bus stops? If it isnt that full, he will stop and ask pax to move in. As in the video, even thou it is not so clear, the bus is full with 2 rows of people formed at the back and with people squeezing at the front door. </p>
              <p>SBST now dunno wad they doing also. Instead of adding freq they add dds. Some svc dont need dd also put. Then all those that need dd dw put.</p>

              <p>There are already several trips of 113A serving this sector already.. I have been there just now around 7pm and saw 113A, full to the brim and 3 mins apart, 113, fully seated.</p>

              <p>I think SBST has a perfect strategy to upgrade SDs to DD slot rather than just adding buses. It is economically more viable in all ways. Who are you to say that SBST dunno what they are doing???</p>
              <p>Just because 113 does not get DDs which most people think is not needed, you disregard all other services including 101, 125, 410 to have DDs. and let me tell you - all these 3 services have higher loading than 113. So adamant on 113 DDs la. You are becoming like SMB228X</p>

              <p>And is it really necessary to deploy double decks to 113? Do you really think it will benefit a lot when the service could just fleet add? </p>
              <p><br>SBS Transit can add double decks for your 113, but will it help eventually? Because the problem I see now is that the svc seems to have a poor frequency for feeders, plus the route length, I feel that there's a need for 1-2 more buses. Further more, is svc43 load so empty? There must be a reason for them to put DDs. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Anyone who says "if sv 43 has DDs, even 113 should get", i really don't know what they are talking. Sv 43 / 43A even from Buangkok Green to NEX is quite a long distance and people move up definitely. The loading is a good 100+ pax on this entire segment. Again Paya Lebar to Marine Parade, guaranteed have 80+ pax at most times during peak.</p>
              <p>You should see if a 135 SD comes at Paya Lebar, it cannot clear the load. It needs a 43 or a 76 to come along to clear the load at Paya Lebar. Please go and observe. Also during AM and PM peak the loading is quite high right from Paya Lebar to Buangkok Green. In fact, 43s DDs are well deserved today.</p>
              <p>SBST managed to transfer a lot of loading on sv 43 by adding buses and capacity. I know earlier people who would take 325 to HCI now prefer 43 to Serangoon instead from Buangkok Green.</p>

              <p>I think you have seriously lost it. I am reading all your posts and I think you just have no idea about route loadings and shooting off your mouth, so please stop before you embarass yourself more.</p>
              <p>56 - already # of DDs are reduced. The ones that are there are timed for AM/PM peak. I wouldn't say this bus is extremely crowded but observe something: 80% of travellers on 56 are long distance travellers. The bus right from Middle Road gets around 50 pax, crosses 65-70 pax at Little India and this loading remains until Toa Payoh Central after which loading falls. Just 3 DDs right now, want to take that away also?</p>
              <p>153 - Same as sv 56. AM peak definitely need DDs. PM is debatable, but again each bus does carry between 60-70 pax and I would prefer to give DD to a long distance route than 113 where the high loading is only 3-4 stops.</p>
              <p>186 - Have you seen the AM loading to Shenton Way? DDs at River Place Condo on Havelock road are filled to the door with some people even standing upstairs. These 5 DDs are perfectly timed. Please take AM peak DD on 186 and then talk.</p>
              <p>119 - already discussed and agree that you don't need DDs</p>
              <p>101 - so many of us were hoping 101 gets DDs because of the loading at Hougang MRT where people cannot board towards Buangkok Link. You are so selfish that just because 113 hasn't got DDs, you want to deny a service like 101 DDs???</p>
              <p>43 - Please don't talk rubbish. This route definitely needs DDs especially the areas it caters to.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>sbst191 is exagerrating the whole 113 situation. Because of the whole discussion, I observed this service 2-3 times, especially at Kovan MRT and even took full route. Bus got high loading at Kovan but not more than 60-65 pax on every bus. Only when bus is delayed as there was a 20 minute interval when 113 did not come and then 113 came. Yes, people could not board, but 113A came in 3 mins later and took only 45 pax.This was observed yesterday.</p></div>

              <p>I think you have seriously lost it. I am reading all your posts
                  and I think you just have no idea about route loadings and shooting
                  off your mouth, so please stop before you embarass yourself
                  more.</p>
              <p>56 - already # of DDs are reduced. The ones that are there are
                  timed for AM/PM peak. I wouldn't say this bus is extremely crowded
                  but observe something: 80% of travellers on 56 are long distance
                  travellers. The bus right from Middle Road gets around 50 pax,
                  crosses 65-70 pax at Little India and this loading remains until
                  Toa Payoh Central after which loading falls. Just 3 DDs right now,
                  want to take that away also?</p>
              <p>153 - Same as sv 56. AM peak definitely need DDs. PM is
                  debatable, but again each bus does carry between 60-70 pax and I
                  would prefer to give DD to a long distance route than 113 where the
                  high loading is only 3-4 stops.</p>
              <p>186 - Have you seen the AM loading to Shenton Way? DDs at River
                  Place Condo on Havelock road are filled to the door with some
                  people even standing upstairs. These 5 DDs are perfectly timed.
                  Please take AM peak DD on 186 and then talk.</p>
              <p>119 - already discussed and agree that you don't need DDs</p>
              <p>101 - so many of us were hoping 101 gets DDs because of the
                  loading at Hougang MRT where people cannot board towards Buangkok
                  Link. You are so selfish that just because 113 hasn't got DDs, you
                  want to deny a service like 101 DDs???</p>
              <p>43 - Please don't talk rubbish. This route definitely needs DDs
                  especially the areas it caters to.</p>

              <p>sbst191 is exagerrating the whole 113 situation. Because of the
              whole discussion, I observed this service 2-3 times, especially at
              Kovan MRT and even took full route. Bus got high loading at Kovan
              but not more than 60-65 pax on every bus. Only when bus is delayed
              as there was a 20 minute interval when <span style="color: #ff0000;">113 did not come and then
              113 came. Yes, people could not board, but 113A came in 3 mins
              later and took only 45 pax.This was observed yesterday.</span></p>

              <p>Eh mister. </p>
              <p>I would have bought your argument on svc 113 had it not been your ridiculous comments. </p>
              <p>293: As a quite frequent traveller of svc 293 I can tell you that svc deserve in fact FULL FLEET DDs for peak hours. In Tampines int, 3 buses have to wait for their turn to unload during AM peak. Why? Coz 293 pax are streaming out of the DDs non-stop for the next 2-3 mins. Fully packed to the door. Don't underestimate 293, young boy. It is the only service that serves as the backbone of the busy areas like St 45, 71 and perhaps 73. And you should see 293 towards Ave 3 during PM peak. No, take a look at either direction. 5 rounds of queues consisting of over 80 pax dominate the centre alleu of the interchange. I don't see how 293 does not deserve DDs at all. With what do you struggle to argue, little boy? The queue still remains long and strong after a 13 min wait for a KUB. I've ever waited 18 mins durin PM peak for the West loop and a STRIDER came. I saw the queue of the remaining people going halfway through the berth. Checked iris and next bus was 14 mins. Oh jolly. And the east loop at that time? DD came, packed to door, just nice. Another time, came to see a 293 wright leaving fully loaded and 6 mins later, another Wright came in and left with not much space to spare. </p>
