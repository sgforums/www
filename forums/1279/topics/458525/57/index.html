              <p>the bus didnt turn into the old hougang south interchange bus stop. Instead, it went straight to blk 210. I think the bc wants to skip unglam stares from pax. I have seen several bcs pressing the horn and hand signalling them to take the next bus.</p>

              Then let me say that there's also other bus rts w/ long distance that has very tight runtime.
              
              Then, the problem w/ 113's mess is mostly at Hougang Ave 1 area.. if you do not pull resources away to maintain 20 mins headways.. chances are, there'll be no improvement...
              
              it's just like the buses in NUS or NTU... why downroutes turn out to be better...

              <p>Agreed. </p>
              <p>Reason why 113 isn't frequent and no DDs is due to the fact how empty the bus can be during peak or not at some sectors. I've ever seen 7 113s leaving HCI literally empty. Literally. I mean, why deploy so many buses onto a svc that's gonna leave and return to the interchange empty? I do agree with frequent 113A slots with crossover DDs, preferably from svcs like 119... coz the sectors where 113A ply are where the svc really gets spot loading. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>113 suay one cause most of the route got alternatives and as for 125 you see Kallang ind area especially during working and lunch time.113 only need DDs during peaks the most but till now its still not feasible for sbst.228 gets DDs? Hmm guess its Bedok reservoir side.Deploy DDs is not what we think can but more to surveys, some full SDs svc also get packed for 2-3 trips then can go empty all the way, some packed during certain timings and some are super packed even for off peaks</p></div>

              <p>113 should maintain its current route cause school students depend on this bus svc to get home, especially serangoon sec side, CHIJ primary and punggol pri.

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, if 113 can cut short following 107's route to kovan also good lah cause can save 2km distance fare, attracting more ppl to queue up at HCI and take this bus svc instead.</span></p>
              <p>Bus stops only got buses to HCI at upp serangoon road and hg ave 8 only got 74 and 147. 113 is needed to make sure that there is a bus every 10 mins at least to HCI.</p>
              <p>113 should have a system like 179A that skips several bus stops and use shortcuts to reach peak bus stops such as kovan station.</p>
              <p>The prob is.. schedule too tight, buses always go off schedule. What can SBST do with only 7 buses for a 16.7KM route? </p>

              <p>And dont forget.</p>
              <p>You misrepresented people like myself who do take 113 to get to
                      HG Ave 8. And when I pointed out that what you claim is a
                      far-fetched argument as we have at least 3 alternatives to get
                      there, you accused me of being selfish (haha!).</p>
              <p>So its your fault for giving me ammunition to shoot you down.
                      ^^v</p>
              <p>Please lah. Grow up!</p>
