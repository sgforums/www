              <p>LTA is going over board with these short bus operations. I am concerned about more congestion near MRTs and interchanges. Also, don't know how this will affect SBST and SMRT with public operators trying to feed onto their revenue, rather with BSEP additional buses should have been added to existing services as required.</p>

              <p><br>As I mentioned above, this seems the most bizzare thing introduced till now by LTA. They could just add BSEP buses to these services if they feel the frequency is not right and demand is more - anyway there are so many spare Citaros and WEGs. Why not deploy them on these services first rather than now bringing in private operators?</p>
              <p>I think LTA is trying to over-please the public and "show" that they are doing a lot but I am not in favor of so many more buses on roads causing traffic jams around MRTs.</p>

              <p>They alr have own PT. </p>
              <p>Wanna talk price? London raise their underground fares every year on average. Tokyo metro charges you S$4 just to travel two damn stops. HK cheats money out of not allowing you to tap out on buses. So current SG PT is considered quite reasonable and cheap alr. </p>
              <p>However, gonna have to agree that after the PO start their svcs the prices will increase, due to the already-high fares of PO and thus maybe the rise of PTO-operated svcs due to drop in demand! Gov is taking advantage and using the least possible to earn more and yet by literal means deliver "more svcs, better connectivity, better rides." This is some å�·å·¥å‡�æ–™ ways LTA is attempting now I guess. </p>

              <p>LTA is going over board with these short bus operations. I am
              concerned about more congestion near MRTs and interchanges. Also,
              don't know how this will affect SBST and SMRT with public operators
              trying to feed onto their revenue, rather with BSEP additional

              <p>these are actually short working trips instead.. not full route...sort of like "A" service i.e 268A, or 912A. LTA is trying out to see whether can save cost or not... cos if go under BSEP, they have to buy the buses and maintain the buses and paid the BC for full days of working.. while for these, they are just paying for the operation cost for the peak hours.. but then whether the total cost add up is more or less, they have to work out the sum...</p>

              <p><br> As I mentioned above, this seems the most bizzare thing introduced
              till now by LTA. They could just add BSEP buses to these
              services if they feel the frequency is not right and demand is more
              - anyway there are so many spare Citaros and WEGs. Why not deploy
              them on these services first rather than now bringing in private
              operators?</p>
              <p>I think LTA is trying to over-please the public and "show" that
              they are doing a lot but I am not in favor of so many more buses on

              <p>I was just wondering this:</p>
              <p>Why don't LTA get private operators to run the express/premium routes that SBST/SMRT are running at peak hours? Services like 513, 850E, 951E, 971E, etc. all can be run by the private operators, using the "City Direct" concept. And then all those BSEP (or non-BSEP) buses can be used to run these feeder short services instead. Then there will be no confusion since the private operators run the express/premium routes, and the public operators run the feeder/trunk routes.</p>
