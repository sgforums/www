              <p>Actually my point is running a new route with 2-3 buses trips in the morning and evening is no go. Does not really benefit many people.  Before LTA take over as the Central Bus Planner, we can see SBST introduced so many full day bus routes (Sv 48, 52, 59, 57 etc). Since LTA takes over, these 2-3 trips routes are being so common and the authority dare to say given commuter more choices! Jesus Christ! Last time private operator do this, they accused them as cherry pickings. nOw they are doing it openly and called it BSEP.</p>

              <p>The loading on MRT in the morning / evening peak hour is crazy even with 2-3 min frequency. CCL is the only line that is still able to cope with the load. Look at the red, green or purple line in peak hours. You have to squeeze yourself in.</p>
              <p>People take MRT for 1-2 stops. This behaviour should change. They do not realize that instead of taking MRT, buses can be quicker. MRT is useful for longer distances. We need bus routes in parallel to MRT with less than 10 min frequency. This way for shorter distance, people will move to buses, rather than walk 500 mts within MRT, which people hardly calculate in their travel time.</p>

              <p>I believe SBST has done a fabulous job with its bus services in the past 1 year. Major service upgrades to so many routes. SMRT on the other hand is trying but cannot because it hasn't got more high capacity buses to deploy.</p>
              <p>So it is just passing bendies around. High time it changes its approach. In a city like Singapore, service can profit with more high capacity buses at a frequency of 6-7 minutes rather than just SDs with frequency of 5 mins. You save on fuel, driver cost, operations everything.</p>
              <p>SMRT needs some good talent to manage its operations. Seriously!!</p>

              <p>Please tell me that you are joking, and not incredibly
              stupid....or horrifically ill-informed.</p>
              <p>All these while train has been the one that has been heavily
              subsidised while bus got 0. THIS is a major reason why our bus
              operations nearly ALWAYS bleeds money when operators buy new buses.
              <strong>Where did you get the idea that trains do not get funds?? I
              actually LOLed when I read this. =&gt; <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Which is why you don't really see them
              channelling to trains that much.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>When finally bus gets the help that it badly needs, you say that
              the money was wasted?? What kind of !!! is this, I ask?</p>
              <p>And with the central planning in place, and especially with the
              distance-based fare, it is so much easier to finally make better
              use of our bus services.</p>
              <p>I find that bus service in general, at least for SBST side, has
              improved by quite a significant margin. <strong>If you don't see any
              improvement, either you are blind.......or you live in SMRT area
              (yeah, you saying that WRI jams are fine comes to mind).</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anyway, long term effect confirm they

              <p>Hello, certain BSEP improvements wasn't even necessary, and it's minor few. Further more, I didn't even state which operators, and you don't even ask<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">, anyhow assumed again? WOW~<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> You should see services 178/925. With or without the BSEP, they still have the almost the same frequency, not even necessary. </span></p>
              <p>Your last sentences seriously made me know that you don't even think <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Do you think the govt. plan this idea out and ended up not benefitting in the end? -.-" Not criticising them but seriously, who will give free stuff w/o benefitting?  </span></p>
              <p>And come on..you should seriously compare Woodlands Interchange jam with other country first before talk cock here, or even those highway jams. Do you even see it often now? If you have observed, the flow is much smoother already, compared to the past. </p>

              <p>No choice, SMRT operations are like that~ They don't really plan out a good strategy to tackle the issue, even with SDs.</p>
              <p>They also placed at wrong timing. One good example is 903, BSEP bus always arrive at 7am for the last stop, the front/back bus is not even close to it, like as if the BSEP bus is replacing an AP slot. So what's the point of BSEP buses to them then? They should learn how svc168 tackle the issue-by having 2 DDs closely attached to the front of 6316B and 1 at the back. The load wise is much lesser and it shows out the way of how BSEP buses are for.</p>

              <p>For Woodlands, it would be best if the current interchange is improvised to link with a new section of Woodlands Reg. Int. if ever planned to build under new coming Woodlands Town Hub... Then at the current new W'lands Xchange where the Pepper Lunch is, the walkway where the tall metal artwork is, can be extended to the new extended section interchange....
