              people talking about services around east - Tampines, Bedok, Eunos,
              Pasir Ris, Clementi, Orchard services are hardly spoken about. The
              major discussion is always around YCK / AMK and HGG / SGK services
              and then another group that discusses SMRT WDL / SBW / YIS services
              and some who speak about the Boon Lay / Jurong Services.</p>

              SBST will not bother of introducing a bus service from any new town to Sembawang, whereas SMRT can start <b>anywhere</b> they like except Pasir Ris, Serangoon, Hougang Central and Jurong East.

              <p>Before all of you talk abt minor tweaks and adjustments on sbst DD services , think about those poor ppl using SMRT bendy buses , the unrefub habits from tibs are more then what SMRT bargained for : some come with a free oven at the rear , free smells from the air con ( if any haha  ) Italy even sent free artists to decorate the bus ducts ,  sad that smrt only gave them black paint </p>
              <p>All this with model EXTRA  hardworking cleaners joined by mechanics of the century.     Complete with pay deductions for drivers to help enjoy their work there ... To make things better , TIB 1089 has its air con blowers reduced into bloody half because company thinks that 250 litres of diesel is too much for the bus to guzzle up in a day</p>
              <p>TIB 1140 has grab poles and window linings re  installed in the wrong direction at the back... The fact is that these buses are not designed for mass production , the design is just so not practical to have 200 in fleet </p>
              <p>BSEP is a total disaster if SMRT does not hire 100 more full time cleaners , cleaner buses benefits one and all , BSEP is just going to improve lives of few alike </p>

              <p>Agree. I already pity my friends in SMRT area and they keep complaining about how better SBST is and how bad the SMRT services are. For them, it is not about getting a seat in the bus, it is about the bus coming in time and even being able to get into the bus. Really sad how Singapore bus services are separated and causing inconvenience to those in SMRT area.</p>

              <p>Since we speak so much about sv 113 here, I decided to go and
              observe myself at Kovan and took the full loop of 113 from HCI to
              HG St 11 and alighted at Kovan. Then observed bus arrivals for
              another 20-30 minutes there.</p>

              <p>Some will say this is not representative sample, but if you observe 113 loading between Hougang and Kovan you will see that the bus does not even get more than 20 pax until it comes to HG Ave 2, Serangoon JC where of course for any bus coming to the stop first, there will be heavy loading.</p>
              <p>Also, the 113 that came was at a 20 minute interval from the one before, and this maybe due to the reduced capacity coz of 113A. All said and done, when the bus during peak hours does not gain even more than 20-30 pax between Hougang and Kovan, how do you justify DDs on this sector??</p>
              <p>113A crossover DDs is fine because yes there is huge spot loading there, but again only for 3-4 stops till HG Ave 1. When people refuse to move to the rear of the KUB, you think they will go to the top of the deck? Maybe some will...</p>

              <p>Actually the highest loading of 113 is after 7pm. That one really. Full ttm. DD ppl boarding from kovan will move up cause of the slow boarding process. Also the bus also have to go down the slope to hougang st 21 and dun forget the slow traffic lights. DD will also attract more ppl to take one round to st 11 and back to their home. Also, 10-16 blocks of minton rise isnt completed yet. Too early to determine anything.</p>

              <p>As I said in my first post, I came back to Kovan MRT around 7.10pm and waited for 20-25 minutes to observe. In this time frame, there was one bus of 113A that came and another of 113. Both the buses had similar pattern. The 113A bus took away 60pax and the 113 went with 65-70 pax.</p>
              <p>I do agree there is quite a bit of loading at Kovan with 50-60 pax boarding every bus. With Minton, this could increase but given the proximity of Minton to Serangoon, I am sure people will prefer to get down at Blk 161 and walk. It is quite a short walk. It would be foolish for someone (unless old and PIW who want bus at door step) to go to Kovan and wait for 113 when you have so many services from Serangoon taking you to Blk 161. So I don't see Minton a reason for crowd on 113 increasing.</p>

              <p>Also I have observed this many times. The main crowd on 113 is from HG Ave 1, not Lor Ah Soo. In fact I observed the people who were on the bus when it turned to Lor Ah Soo, were mostly the ones who boarded on HG St 21 and HG Ave 1 rather than Kovan MRT. Also on return leg, people who boarded on Lor Ah Soo actually got down at HG Ave 1 and HG St 21.</p>
              <p>Basically, through my route I saw that people take 113 for very short distances.</p>

              <p>Well kovan does have great food afterall. I notice alot of office workers like to buy food from kovan and take 113 home. Morning school hours 113 quite packed also. 70 pax every bus from kovan station towards yuying. Maybe u can try 6.30am-7.25am. </p>

              <p>For those particular times lots, you can have added capacity. SBST is going on adding capacity on sv 45 and sv 53. I think it is encouraging people from Lor Ah Soo and HG Ave 1 to go to Serangoon rather than Kovan.</p>

              <p>Also I have observed this many times. The main crowd on 113 is
              from HG Ave 1, not Lor Ah Soo. In fact I observed the people who
              were on the bus when it turned to Lor Ah Soo, were mostly the ones
              who boarded on HG St 21 and HG Ave 1 rather than Kovan MRT. Also on
              return leg, people who boarded on Lor Ah Soo actually got down at
              HG Ave 1 and HG St 21.</p>
              <p>Basically, through my route I saw that people take 113 for very
              short distances.</p>

              <p>Most of the time i see is most pax alight at lorong ah soo opposite NKF. Alighting at kovan station is more of ppl going to work. Ppl alighting along hougang st 21 is for going to the FC to makan.</p>

              <p>2 DD buses if planned well, it would work well. School students will love to go to the upper deck. Office workers too. </p>
              <p>SBS Transit is smart enough not to perm citaros on 113. Otherwise it would be a disaster</p>

              <p>Hougang crowd is more of school students. U shud try taking 113 from kovan after 7pm till 9pm. U can wait there and see the much bigger crowd, full load at kovan station. </p>

              <p><br>Also since you say highest loading point is after 7pm - even better. Have crossover DDs from sv 107 or sv 153 that come from CBD to do sv 113A after 7pm rather than them going to the depot.</p>
