              <p>I suspect the effects of switching to distance fare have caused
              a noticable impact on bus revenue (and profitability).</p>
              <p>Leasing is a more viable option if LTA wants competition via bus
              tendering. They can start off with the BSEP fleet on hand once
              the free 10 years is up. </p>
              <p>If LTA does take this step, SBS Transit and SMRT Buses would
              have "helped" them a lot in this regard by standardising their new
              purchases (i.e. by limiting to the current 3 bus models). </p>

              <p>That seems likely enough.</p>
              <p>A quick calculation reveals that lifetime revenue of bus &lt; lifetime cost for both PTOs.</p>
              <p>If LTA doesn't step in soon, bus ops will be in big trouble.</p>

              ah 2601...
              
              3 star dunno how manage things la.. say "Cost + Plus Margin" method would help SMRT...
              
              eating his own words.. govt wouldn't want to use this scheme to pay cost inefficient operators... who in right mind would pay higher cost + margin when it's taxpayers + fare collection?
              
              give up la... It's just using SAF style of management to manage buses... not enough bus? add more bus lor...
              
              btw.. 3625D revived or going to be revived liao...

              <p>Got money at that time mah? Plus, at start, I think they already have too many buses(with less depot space).</p>
              <p>In my opinion, I would rather wait for at least a 5th depot to be ready. By then, constructions can start for some buses going to Wenya, leaving either WLDEP/AMDEP(or even KJDEP) to Wenya control IF POSSIBLE(base on route, most likely KJ/WLDEP). </p>
              <p>And after the completion of the DD-friendly depot, the 2nd depot can go for change. At least it won't cock up the svc..</p>

              <p>My point is that the current and past bus system is
                  unsustainable for both PTOs.</p>
              <p>It is for this reason that LTA, if you notice, is gradually
                  taking control of many aspects of bus operations, starting with
                  route planning, and now depot construction.</p>
              <p>BSEP is very likely to be an experiment, as much as a practical
                  short-term solution, by LTA to gain an even greater foothold in bus
                  ops and further leverage on PTOs, to twist their arms, so to
                  speak.</p>
              <p>You know what I think will be the next step?</p>
              <p>LTA buys buses, to be leased to PTOs.</p>
              <p>Like the recent case with Transport for London, where they
                  purchased 600 DDs to be leased on tender basis to bus
                  operators.</p>
              <p>Mark my words! </p>
              <p>LTA has been dropping a lot of hints on this and have made no
                  secret about studying competitive tendering as in the Scandinavian
                  countries and London.</p>

              <p>LTA should nationalise the entire bus fleet and rebrand them as TransitLink. Route Groups to be bundled under contract areas and offered for tender like what Transperth has done. SBS, SMB &amp; WT to be mere contractors like Swan Transit, Path Transit &amp; Veolia Transdev.</p>
              <p>Bendies retained but kept mostly for express routes. DDs to take over most city trunk routes.</p>
              <p>If TransitLink can score a 50-year exclusive deal with Scania even better.</p>

              <p>LTA should nationalise the entire bus fleet and rebrand them as
              TransitLink. Route Groups to be bundled under contract areas and
              offered for tender like what Transperth has done. SBS, SMB &amp; WT

              Transdev.</p>
              <p>Bendies retained but kept mostly for express routes. DDs to take
              over most city trunk routes.</p>
              <p>If TransitLink can score a 50-year exclusive deal with Scania
              even better.</p>

              <p>If they had one operator for every area, it would be like the problem before the SBS-era. Then gahman will 'renationalise/nationalise more' the bus company then skally SBST agan. Then later they say to compete open a new PTC. This is just repeating history in my opinion.</p>

              <p>I m nt sure about QoS for trunks, feeders...<br>I only know there is an inefficient allocation of resources nowadays... 70's fleet has been bumped up till 4 -6 mins peak twds Shenton Way. <br>The 2nd bus is half full, 3rd 1/4 full...<br>854 is also bumped up to 4 - 5mins freq during peak, comfortable definitely but i would rather every service fleet be equally bumped up so that EVERY COMMUTER can enjoy rather than a few selected services...</p>
