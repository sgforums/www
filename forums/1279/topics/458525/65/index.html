              <p>195 is a popular route - doing that could inconvenience a lot of people. 120 could follow the route above that I am suggesting as it connects areas in Redhill, Tanglin Halt, Margaret Dr and Tehlok Blangah where there is no or just 1 alternative service. </p>

              <p>I agree with you about service 120. LTA and PTO should revise the route again. The bus is totally empty during off peak and less than 10 pax on the bus during peak hours. That is not a good sign. We want 120 to be utilized  but the problem is LTA  and the PTO did not plan the route properly,that's why they need to amend the route. Totally waste of  resources as what've you mentioned on your post. It's already 5 months since 120 has been launched but yet,the loading is unacceptable and not even up to standard. Do you realised that the housing estate that 120 route ply is a low quality housing estate area. Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah,is one examples of low quality housing estate area that have less people living around the estate area. And I also pity the drivers, driving an empty bus. </p>

              <p>I don't think LTA and PTO are very good at planning routes. Some of us here can give better suggestions. For instance, 116 could have been planned better. 141 for sure. This route connects so many MRT yet the loading is not that great. They decided to terminate at Lor 1 which is really stupid decision. The loading for 141 is more between Pei Koi Estate and Toa Payoh as it is exclusive to this area. Had they extended the route there would have been more loading.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right. The density is not that high and when they were extending 124 in the first place, there was no need for 120. 124 makes a lot more sense as it gives you connection to both CCL / NEL / Malls. Tehlok Blangah MRT has nothing but CCL for which people can go to HF and take bus or take 176 to Henderson Road. There was no need for a new bus. The routing was faulty in the first place.</p>
