              <p>Eh mister. </p>
              <p>I would have bought your argument on svc 113 had it not been your ridiculous comments. </p>
              <p>293: As a quite frequent traveller of svc 293 I can tell you that svc deserve in fact FULL FLEET DDs for peak hours. In Tampines int, 3 buses have to wait for their turn to unload during AM peak. Why? Coz 293 pax are streaming out of the DDs non-stop for the next 2-3 mins. Fully packed to the door. Don't underestimate 293, young boy. It is the only service that serves as the backbone of the busy areas like St 45, 71 and perhaps 73. And you should see 293 towards Ave 3 during PM peak. No, take a look at either direction. 5 rounds of queues consisting of over 80 pax dominate the centre alleu of the interchange. I don't see how 293 does not deserve DDs at all. With what do you struggle to argue, little boy? The queue still remains long and strong after a 13 min wait for a KUB. I've ever waited 18 mins durin PM peak for the West loop and a STRIDER came. I saw the queue of the remaining people going halfway through the berth. Checked iris and next bus was 14 mins. Oh jolly. And the east loop at that time? DD came, packed to door, just nice. Another time, came to see a 293 wright leaving fully loaded and 6 mins later, another Wright came in and left with not much space to spare. </p>

              <p><br>I agree. This sbst191 has gone mad. sv 293 deserves more DDs. I think a fleet of 6 DDs, 7 SDs would be good.</p>

              <p>Agreed. But the ones already with AMDEP and BNDEP should be deployed perm. Don't register more BSEP buses for the time being.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned, sv 81 can get 3355H as fleet add. The frequency is not that good and the loading can be significant in peak hours. Also, it has not got a SD --&gt; DD upgrade or fleet add since Apr 2012 (that's the date from when I am tracking) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I don't really find the damned logic in the BSEP deployment scheme. </p>
              <p>You see, the system that works now is that those svcs with &gt;80% buses will get BSEP. And the bus is one split shift bus. But what sucks is the rapid registration of the BSEP buses and now all the BSEP buses are running around JUST BECAUSE of the fixed rule that BSEP buses MUST stay on their perm svc and the BSEP buses MUST perm the svc they are allocated to. This takes time, and in the end the BSEP buses run around at svcs that have low demand and leaving some higher demand svcs neglected. </p>
              <p>I mean, why can't BSEP be more flexible? Why waste time looking at svcs and allowing the BSEP buses run on all sorts of crazy low-demand svcs when it could have alr been into good use on svcs that have crowding problems for a long time, such as 27. And why one bus at a time? The buses are coming faster than the lists of svcs coming out. And it could also have been used for making svcs Wheelchair-accessible, such as the HGDEP svcs. And why must BSEP always be Citaros? For example svc 120. Why can't svc 120 use KUBs? And why can't svc 4 use a few B10Ms? It has the destos anyways. </p>
              <p>These are yet to be solved. Not saying the status quo of BSEP is very bad, but just hope a little reorganisation can get the commuters a less crowded bus quicker. </p>

              <p>These are very minor topics according to me. Your comment that BSEP buses run on low-demand svcs is not true according to me. If you see 3347, 3348, 3349 they are always running on either 55/70/72/76. 3355H runs mostly on 168. </p>
              <p>And why does sv 120 even need KUBs. The Citaros go empty. Why does sv 4 need B10Ms when newer WAB buses are available for it. </p>
              <p>Of course there is scope for improvement but the major issue is SBST has done such a good job with fleet upgrade and additions that with BSEP now they are not sure which service to deploy on. </p>
              <p>What is your take? Which AMDEP/BRBP services should get 3347/48/49? Which BNDEP / CGBP service should get 3355H? Apparently, even 3354K is spare right now and not on sv 17 as some claim.</p>

              <p>Ok, I buy your case on 120 but If that's the case then I really don't understand why 120 should deserve that fleet then. Why not just 1 or 2 buses just like svc 11? Since its seasonal load.</p>
              <p>As for svc 4, prove that it needs the WABs more than the other svcs. And BNDEP/CGBP itself is pretty much okay with its WAB management. Why not send the buses over to HGDEP, to svcs like 153 and 159? These svcs both connect old folk's favourites. </p>
              <p>As you have agreed on, this is why BSEP needs a review. So that it makes great svcs even better, besides catering to svcs in need. </p>
              <p>And yes, I have seen cases when BSEP does svcs like 85. It could be one of the minority, but it is still a sign. </p>
