              <p>The loading like 43...</p>
              <p>When 2-3 trains arrive than the bus that comes will be packed..</p>
              <p>I have observed the loading patterns of 113 and i found out that 5.30pm-7pm, 113A and 113 will leave kovan mrt station with a packed 113A and fully seated 113. After that, 7pm onwards, 7.10pm 113 will be fully packed and 113A will arrive 8-10 minutes, with a few standees. It's not the frequency.. it's the amount of people alighting at kovan station to board this bus svc.. You can put 3 buses that come within the span of 10 minutes but only 1 bus will be full. If however, the schedule is adjusted and more capacity is added, then you will see why dds are justified. When 113A arrives and take all the pax, suddenly another 113 arrives, sometimes empty or fully seated only. 113A is planned to take remaining pax from the bus stops but in reality.. it is ironic.. in fact 113 takes the remaining pax.. the schedule is messed up..</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">113 always go off schedule.. always like to be early 5 mins to reach bus stop and depart.. taking commuters from the 1-2 trains that reach the station only.. If it is properly adjusted, all buses will be able to take commuters from the trains @ 3 min frequency. I cant explain fully because i no longer take 113, but this is the pattern i have observed yesterday.. You should go and observe at blk 210 bus stop hougang st 21 and see whether ppl can board the bus anot.. during the period after 6.30pm to 9pm.. 8.45pm time slot also packed. I think the crowd is after makan.</span></p>

              <p>The loading like 43...</p>
              <p>When 2-3 trains arrive than the bus that comes will be
              packed..</p>
              <p>I have observed the loading patterns of 113 and i found out that
              5.30pm-7pm, <strong>113A and 113 will leave kovan mrt station with a packed
              113A and fully seated 113.</strong> After that, 7pm onwards, 7.10pm 113 will
              be fully packed and 113A will arrive 8-10 minutes, with a few
              standees. It's not the frequency.. it's the amount of people
              alighting at kovan station to board this bus svc.. <strong>You can put 3
              buses that come within the span of 10 minutes but only 1 bus will
              be full. </strong>If however, the schedule is adjusted and more capacity is
              added, then you will see why dds are justified. When 113A arrives
              and take all the pax, suddenly another 113 arrives, sometimes empty
              or fully seated only. 113A is planned to take remaining pax from
              the bus stops but in reality.. it is ironic.. in fact 113 takes the
              remaining pax.. the schedule is messed up..</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">113 always go off schedule..
              always like to be early 5 mins to reach bus stop and depart..
              taking commuters from the 1-2 trains that reach the station only..
              If it is properly adjusted, all buses will be able to take
              commuters from the trains @ 3 min frequency. I cant explain fully
              because i no longer take 113, but this is the pattern i have
              observed yesterday.. You should go and observe at blk 210 bus stop
              hougang st 21 and see whether ppl can board the bus anot.. during
              the period after 6.30pm to 9pm.. 8.45pm time slot also packed. I

              <p>You tell me how many buses are there in 113A. And with the existing frequency of 16-23mins, starting from 5:50pm to 7:23pm, how do you expect the service to improve? If you adjust the schedule, or add 1 more SD, or add more trips till 8:30pm, do you think it's not able to be improve? </p>
              <p>I don't need to put 3 buses within 10mins. If you want a better way, it's fleet add to current 113 with more shift running during peak, and 113A with more trips. If your frequency is already cock up, don't bother talking about the capacity. Because eventually, the capacity will also cock up. By looking at 113A and 113's frequency range at 1700-1900, I can tell it's totally CMI. 16-20MINS per bus, obviously there would be big issue. </p>
              <p>Not everything needs DD one, it's the matter of how they deploy. Given that 113 arrives at 1735 AND 1755, Obviously they should put it at 1745. </p>

              <p>Your peak hour frequency at 15mins is obviously going to cause passengers unable to board. Even if you pull a double deck, I can tell you it will still be full, and some passengers will still be unable to board. </p>
              <p>1-2mins already make a big difference, and further more, is there a need to loop back to Kovan from Lor Ah Soo during the PM peak? </p>
              <p>They add DD, but the frequency still damn cui, what's the point? I can give you Double Deck Bendy, but like what you said, the population increasing, at the end of the day, you still need to touch on the frequency. So why not adjust the frequency to see clearly the issue? </p>
