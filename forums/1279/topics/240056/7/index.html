Each manufacturer has to submit a bid which probably includes the price, maintenance details, cost of parts, delivery details, credit terms blah blah blah...meaning they had to bid for the SMRT tender/account.  In this case SMRT did not bid for anything.</div>

On Saturday, 5pm onwards already drop to 8min frequency. Every week I take from BNL, already got people standing. When the train arrive at Jurong East, wah, packed to the door! This is some more off peak still can pack to door!</div>

Ever since SMRT took over from TIBS in 2004, no new buses have been bought in at all. Look as SBST - now got VSOs, CNEs and B9TLs. Instead of buying new buses, SMRT took opportunity to withdraw CSS sv 605 and recycle some of its old and poor conditoned Nissan buses to SMRT, hence spoiling the image of SMRT. If TIBS is still existing, maybe TIB1248D will be a new bus model instead of those ex CSS buses. Who knows, maybe no addition to the current fleet wif those recycled Nissan buses.<br><br>2. The cleaniness of the current SMRT buses had worsened. Based on the feedbacks from some of u all posted in the forums I can sense tat the buses are very dirty. Furthermore I oso noticed tat some buses have black patches, litters and dust all over the interior of the buses. Btw I still remembered the cockroach trap tat TIBS used in the past.<br><br>3. Some of the bus svcs (eg. 178, 852, 922, 966 n 980 etc juz to name a few), the bus frequencies had worsened over the past few years. Can be as long as 18-20 mins/bus.<br><br>4. From the paintworks of some of the buses, I can oso tell tat SMRT is really very cheapskate. Instead of repainting its current buses (from TIBS to SMRT livery) to give a brand new look, noticed tat SMRT only touched up the base of its buses. Can tell from its side patches. Those from fully painted buses revert to SMRt livey, sometimes SMRT juz apply stickers painted wif yellowish white coat to cover tat's all. These stickers also do peel off easily too.</div>

They forgot to pry off the badge. So the badge bulges out from the sticker.<br><br>But for SBS, most of their buses are repainted instead of restickered. Only the later SDs are being restickered. But the restickered buses do have a coat of SBST paint underneath. So when it peels off, it doesn't look that bad. Unlike SMRT, where you start to see yellow and orange once the sticker peels off.</div>
