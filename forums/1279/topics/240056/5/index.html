            <div class='col-md body'>i believe part of the reason to withdraw CSS is to better consolidate SMRT Buses by removing GLDEP and shifting them to the 3 existing depots.<br><br>By allocating the remaining CSS buses to SMRT; it would help ease shortage of buses and need not buy new buses that need to comply Euro 4 standard for the time-being (thats why COE for buses and trucks remain at $1 for so many times lately).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"These services also ply similar sections of the route as CSS 608. Passengers who travel along popular routes such as Shenton Way, Marine Parade and Bedok therefore have other services to choose from."<br><br>This is a croc of shit.  Based on this logic, you can cancel any bus route that doesn't travel sections unique from other services.  Convenient bus routes take passengers from Point A to Point B in as few changes as possible.  Otherwise routes would ply one road from end-to-end and nothing more.<br><br>Service 608 is the opposite of this.  It runs a meandering route, granting communters the only direct way to travel between choice locations.   It's a unique route that isn't made redundant by other services.  As basic examples, 608 is the only service to ply (and stop along) Maxwell Road. It's the only service from Mountbatten to serve the stadium and the only service from the stadium to the CBD (popular with park n' ride commuters).  It's the only service from Katong to the back of City Hall.<br><br>Also, as others have noted, the route is still popular, especially during peak hours.<br><br>Has Singapore's population shifted so dramatically in 7 years?  I doubt so!  I would hazard to guess that the 40% drop in commuters is due to a significant drop in service frequency.  608s ran much more frequently a couple of years ago, but nowdays they run rarely enough for me to try another route instead (often meaning a fair walk).  Has anybody else noticed this?  A lot of people dislike the older buses, another reason for lack of ridership.<br><br>In my opinion the 608 service still plies a viable route, but it's being cancelled due to business or logistical reasons particular to SSB and SMRT.  It would make sense for SMRT to run a new service with new buses, or for SBST to take over the route.<br><br>For those more knowledgable about this, how does route tendering work in SG?  Also, are there obligations of service once a route is picked up by a company?<br></div>

Passengers who travel along popular routes such as Shenton Way, Marine Parade and Bedok therefore have other services to choose from."<br><br>This is a croc of shit.  Based on this logic, you can cancel any bus route that doesn't travel sections unique from other services.  Convenient bus routes take passengers from Point A to Point B in as few changes as possible.  Otherwise routes would ply one road from end-to-end and nothing more.<br><br>Service 608 is the opposite of this.  It runs a meandering route, granting communters the only direct way to travel between choice locations.   It's a unique route that isn't made redundant by other services.  As basic examples, 608 is the only service to ply (and stop along) Maxwell Road. It's the only service from Mountbatten to serve the stadium and the only service from the stadium to the CBD (popular with park n' ride commuters).  It's the only service from Katong to the back of City Hall.<br><br>Also, as others have noted, the route is still popular, especially during peak hours.<br><br>Has Singapore's population shifted so dramatically in 7 years?  I doubt so!  I would hazard to guess that the 40% drop in commuters is due to a significant drop in service frequency.  608s ran much more frequently a couple of years ago, but nowdays they run rarely enough for me to try another route instead (often meaning a fair walk).  Has anybody else noticed this?  A lot of people dislike the older buses, another reason for lack of ridership.<br><br>In my opinion the 608 service still plies a viable route, but it's being cancelled due to business or logistical reasons particular to SSB and SMRT.  It would make sense for SMRT to run a new service with new buses, or for SBST to take over the route.<br><br>For those more knowledgable about this, how does route tendering work in SG?  Also, are there obligations of service once a route is picked up by a company?<br></div></blockquote>Noticed about the change in frequency too. Looks like SMRT wont be interested in introducing new services or amend the route of services based on their reply in STOMP</div>

They don't even care about human lives getting crushed like tiny, pitiful ants under the wheels of their MRT trains (i.e. refusal to install barriers in their MRT stations, which is starting to smell like wells of death  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  ); do you think they are concerned about the inconvenience of hundreds, if not even thousands of commuters?<br><br>To them, we are just walking stashes of $$$ for them to extract  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  .<br><br>Blargh - even SAF gave up on them when they switched from $MRT buses to private buses for their Tekong Ferry Terminal shuttle...<br><br>I really wish to live in Punggol - not a single $MRT bus route in sight until you get to Sengkang, and fully operated by SBS Transit, whether it's bus, MRT, or LRT! Unlike Sembawang, where everything is fully $MRT until you get to Woodlands or Yishun - and even then, only two SBS Transit bus routes in each place (discounting Woodlands Checkpoint with routes 160 and 170)!<br><br>Someone, O someone, please start a "Save Service 608" campaign, before insanity ensues...</div>
