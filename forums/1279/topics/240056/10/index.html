            <div class='col-md body'>Specially went to take route 608 today - and a CSS bus - for one last time. The bus was CSS 204T, boarded it around 6:00PM (sunset time - which added to the sense of a "passing of an era" feel) near the Marine Parade Community Centre/Community Library, and I originally intended to take the bus from Marine Parade to the Esplanade area, but decided to take it all the way to Bukit Merah instead. The ride was surprising smooth, fast, and (I shall say) even comfortable from start to end; it actually sped along Nicoll Highway, and it was hardly a bumpy ride at all. The bus was also (surprisingly) quite well-maintained, save for some stains and rubbish on the windows and floors.<br><br>I am wondering how those senior citizens are going to go about their business now, especially those living in the Havelock area that only had this bus route. I mused, sarcastically, to myself that "this is low ridership" when I boarded the bus at Marine Parade (there were 27 passengers was on that bus at that time, including myself). I estimated that at least 60 people went through the bus throughout my journey.<br><br>One curious thing: towards the end of the bus' journey at Bukit Merah, there were these two boys who boarded the bus. The younger boy (I think he's probably 8 or 9 years old - the older one, I think he's 10 or 11) started snapping away with their camera, taking pictures of the front of the bus. They also took the opportunity to get some of the paper tickets lying around; they later got off the bus at Bukit Merah Interchange. I wonder if they are members around here...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kengkia:</div><div class="quote_body">i took the bus from bedok to bt merah int ard 1730 and it was an CAC bus din take note of the rego though i reached bt merah int ard 1900 . upon alighting i saw some teenagers talking to the BC then i am sure u guys know what the topic abt rite ....is these guys sgf guys??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Was he in a black long-sleeved shirt?<br><br>...if yes, I think you just saw me (and I think I might have seen you too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</div>
