Different people living at different places will already have different lifestyles.<br>Like for people living around my area, it is quite common to see them taking 70 from my hse bus stop all the way to suntec or shenton way even though the journey is around 1 hr long as compared to bus and transfer to MRT.<br><br>Anyway, just last sat, waited for 147 for 30 mins never come so in the end, take 13, 853 and then 70 back. Check on IRIS at home about freq of 147 and I realise that there is serious bunching around Chinatown area as they have closed the roads for Mid Autumn Festival.</div>
