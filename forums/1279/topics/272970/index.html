It helps to relieve the loads of 190 during peak hours. One problem is that the service goes one big round over yew tee area.

            <div class='col-md body'>Last thurs on the 9th Aug 07 during NDP cover, my senior medic tells me of how frustuated he thinks about the public transport in Singapore. Note that he is not angry but frustuated. He cycles to Bedok camp from his hse at Woodlands area. He said that from Bedok int to hougang stadium that area following 25, 854 route, he just need 30 mins. I was shocked, stunned and amazed. Of course, his cycling route involves cutting thorugh Kembangan estate into Jln Eunos.<br><br>There was once he used an 854 bus as a reference and he cycled from Bedok to Yishun during the evening peak hrs. He reached Yishun 15 mins before that particular 854 bus and he attributed that to many traffic lights, longer route and traffic jams along Jln Eunos area.<br><br>Looks like I should try cycling as a means of transport.</div>

Common sense will tell you that it doesnt make sense to go one big round on the MRT system.</div>

Note that he is not angry but frustuated. He cycles to Bedok camp from his hse at Woodlands area. He said that from Bedok int to hougang stadium that area following 25, 854 route, he just need 30 mins. I was shocked, stunned and amazed. Of course, his cycling route involves cutting thorugh Kembangan estate into Jln Eunos.<br><br>There was once he used an 854 bus as a reference and he cycled from Bedok to Yishun during the evening peak hrs. He reached Yishun 15 mins before that particular 854 bus and he attributed that to many traffic lights, longer route and traffic jams along Jln Eunos area.<br><br>Looks like I should try cycling as a means of transport. </div></blockquote>That looks strange? Well, 123 is a worser example. You just need to cycle from Buikit Merah to Bukit Purmei and you're there. I must say that walking in to Johor is better when there are jams. You at least beat the bus by 15 mins to an hour.</div>

There is service 275 from Bt Merah to Bt Purmei. 123 is a route more to provide a direct link from Bt Purmei to Tiong Bahru to Orchard.</div>

On National Day, Chuila St encounters traffic jams due to people coming here to watch fireworks. I guess Raffles Avenue encounters slow traffic. Almost Saturday around 2000 in the night, Serangoon Rd will encounter traffic jams too, causing delays for bus trips.<br><br>I guess one thing that the authorities can do to increase the quality of public transport is to reduce the number fo vehicles on the road. Besides, this move is more environmental friendly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
