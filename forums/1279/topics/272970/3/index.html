This serves the same purpose as 190 for taking CCK North residents to the city. It<br>helps to relieve 190 which is a high demand service. After that, it duplicates 36 from Orchard to Marine Parade. Again, it helps to relieve 36's demand which I think is rather high. Next, it follows 196, 197 routes to Bedok int.<br><br>Wow, seems like if this route is implemented, Bedok int is really jam packed with lots of bus services. Does SBST consider expanding the bus interchange?</div>

It has roughly around 20.5 - 21 stages.<br>Out of 20.5- 21 stages, there are 13 stages whereby this service duplicates with 851 from Yishun to Marymount Rd.<br><br>The route along Lor 8 Toa Payoh is rather well planned as you have utilised that slip road onto Braddell Rd (where 238 loops at ) for one direction while using the junction between Lor 8 Toa Payoh and Lor 6 Toa Payoh at the another.<br><br>I have some recommendations for this service in order for it not to be duplicated with 851 by a lot.<br>1. This service can turn at AMK Ave 6 to AMK Ave 3 to terminate AMK interchange. First, it provides a direct link from Lor 8 Toa Payoh to AMK.<br>2. Or if you don't like the first suggestion, here is another. If it goes to Yishun, I suggest this service to ply the east side of Yishun Ring Rd following 811 then 804 route. After that, turn back into Yishun Ave 2 and to Yishun Int after that.<br><br>I guess probably Lor 4 Toa Payoh is a central road to divide Toa Payoh town and thus the reason why many trunk services ply there.<br>I will also suggest services that goes in a westward direction after plying Lor 6 Toa Payoh to Braddell Rd to reroute so as to utilise Lor 8 Toa Payoh. Not sure whether DDs can be plied there. Services like 57, 88, 157, 163 can be rerouted.<br><br></div>

Faster link from eastern area to keppel area.<br><br>Disadvantages of this service:<br>1. Traffic congestion may result during peak hrs at ECP and causes the delays in bus journeys.<br>2. Fare stages is 53 which is a lot. Bus route is probably too long.<br><br>Any comments?</div>

Travelling time is cut to the minimal when travelling from Hougang, Sengkang or even Punggol to CCK.<br><br>I am just thinking (I am not sure myself) perhaps this route will not have much demand because, it serves only the eastern side of Hougang, western side of Sengkang near the Central and the ulu side of Punggol and finally straight to CCK int. The number of residential homes that is covered by this route is not significant unless people are willing to walk a fair amount of distance just to take this service to CCK.<br><br>Just an opinion, nice route though.</div>
