I dunno u guys believe him wat he say.. Some people are cooking up their own stories. SBS 3731E is due to the accident .. Some buses are scrapped and others are de registered because of some reason...  It is nth to involve with the maintainance job. Buses are strictly schedule for maintainance. SLBP do nt had any MB0405 suffering from suspesion problem but we do hav some in other depot.. AMDEP are having majority of mercz, maybe they are gd in maintaining mercz(Cos keep doing the same thing and just replace anythingwith new spare parts without rectifying the problem)  but nt for their LO3x and DM3500.  U can see SLBP and BBDEP need to maintain different model including private buses ..<br><br>Listen to the DM3500 engine sound in SLBP and AMDEP and you would know the difference. Mostly all DM3500 in AMDEP are not refurbished wit new seats. Pls la..To buy that new spare parts and change it is very Ex u know..<br><br>SLBP got their multi-storey depot long ago now then got money for AMDEP.. The facts are sometimes SLBP buses are repaired by BBDEP . So they are close working parties. Just like AMDEP and BRBP sharing buses..<br><br>I dun see any difference wit the VO3x between AMDEP /HGDEP/ SLBP.. Listen to the LO3x between AMDEP &amp; SLBP and you would know the difference. Listen to SBS 9030E. Dun forget SLBP buses always got working Rear lights and Headlights (The top one) but u would nt see this in other depot..</div>
