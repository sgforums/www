And the other depot only knows how to poorly maintain 5 kinds of buses.

And the other depot only knows how to poorly maintain 5 kinds of buses. Also the depot started refurb their buses since April or May (many people here can vouch for it), not like some depot, September or October. At least that depot only minority got a bit of problem, not like some other depot which has majoirty of their buses with hot air coming out.</div></blockquote>Ya, some of the depot neglect the maintainance job and now transfer their buses to another depot. You can see another depot need to help them change the headlights, rearlights and even the service plates display light. Hahaz, I think someone is not showing facts here. I think the depot you are always proud out it seems to disappoint u as they only start refurbish their buses on early july whereas another depot start at early May with even one of their buses get the interior ceiling replaced. Above hot air, i would admit them most buses from every depot had this problem only it is serious or not that serious. Just like the respraying job by some depot and another depot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I'm new here.  Do you think Sv 81 should be extended to Bishan/Ang Mo Kio via (existing route), Upper Serangoon Rd, Braddell Rd, Bishan Rd, (continue down to Bishan/Ang Mo Kio)? Since the demand now isn't really that good (I think so), and plus, it provides a new link between Bishan and Kovan.</div>
