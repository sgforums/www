A torque converter is found inside vehicles with automatic transmission. A torque converter is also knwon as a fluid coupling. It is merely a connection between the engine and the driveshaft which prevents the engine from stalling when the vehicle is stationary.<br><br>Take 2 fans and place them facing each other. Turn on 1 fan and the air flow will cause the blades on the other fan to turn too. However, the force is weak and you can stop the blades on the the other fan by just applying a light pressure. That is exactly the principle of a torque converter. You have 1 turbine connected to the engine and another turbine connected to the driveshaft, both of them placed inside a casing filled with oil. The engine turbine will turn and stir the oil which will turn the driveshaft turbine. When idling, the force is weak so a light pressure on he brakes is suffice to make the vehicle motionless. Once you relase the brakes, the driveshaft turbine will turn and this turns the wheels, so the bus 'crawls'.<br><br>The torque converter multiplies torque when the engine turbine spins much faster than the driveshaft turbine. This occurs during moving off. However, this becomes a burden once the driveshaft turbine is spinning at almost the same speed as the engine turbine. The driveshaft turbine, being the one driven, will never match the speed of the engine turbine and this is known as 'slippage'. To overcome this, there is a special mechanism that 'locks' the two once they are spinning at about the same speed, forming a physical connection between the engine, the driveshaft and the wheels. In other words, the torque converter will work during moving off only. Now, automatic gearboxes need not have torque convertors, thanks to Continous Variable Transmission (CVT) which uses a complex system of pulleys.<br><br>NBS (Neutral at Bus Stop; also known as ANS: Automatic Neutral Shift) is a different thing. What it does is to automatically select Neutral when the bus is stationary. Its main purpose is to reduce fuel consumption.</div>

SBS 2784J (66 SLBP) do not have seats like those of normal Volvo B10M MKIV WA Striders/DM3500. Instead, their seats were those of the colours the Scania N113CRB use (excluding the newly refurbished SBS 0073R). Could they have swapped the colours instead?<br><br>Please correct me if I am wrong.</div></blockquote>SBS2784J's seat are the original seats of DM3500. Those seats that are yellow are refurbished last year for the IMF. You never take MK IVs before last year?<br></div>

Most DM3500 on svc 51,66 and 105 like SBS 2786D, SBS2770Z and SBS2708E were not deployed to the IMF but their seats were refurbished after the IMF!
