So I rode off my bike without releasing side stand and nearly crashed. I bought 7 mototrbikes before. And thankfully most of them now have a cut off switch at the side stand. If the side stand is down, clutch out for Suzuki G6, the engine cannot even start. If the side stand is down for the R1, the moment I engage gear, the engine will stall. All these come to help out as a safety net to prevent the rider from facing consequences of a moment's folly.<br><br>I also recall during a stressful day's work forgetting to release handbrake when I drove off. "How come the pick-up no power?" Then realised the handbrakes still on.<br><br>By right the signal indicators are supposed to off itself as your steering wheel is straightened after turning. But sometimes the signal indicator is faulty so you need to hit back yourself. But I also forget to off it sometimes. When riding motorbike, the signal indicator is fully manual. I also forgot to off before. And I cannot guarantee in future I will always remember to off it too.<br><br>The first time when I drove a continental car was an Opel Astra. I was so used to japanese right hand signal left hand wiper. Then when I turned out, I hit the 'signal' and the wiper came up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I also drove the Peugeot 1007 before. Optional tiptronic Gear shift is behind the steering wheel. Not quite used to it keep bringing to the wrong gear also.<br><br>All these are part and parcels of our lives on the roads.

If you can stay far away from these people will be the safest. I was disturbed many times on the road while on my flashy bikes. 1 Evo tailedgated me on northsouth highway while I was on my suzuki600 and refused to pass me even though I let the car pass. I cut several cars and went up to 240kph, the driver still chased after and tailed me. From the mirror I saw that it was a girl. The number plate started with SDP. That time was new car. Just stay away as much as possible.<br><br>Some BC also behave that way. Some 'racers' like MB0405 very much for the handling. Really bastards to their colleagues.There were even cases whereby BC refused to report speedlimiter out of calibration.</div>

So I rode off my bike without releasing side stand and nearly crashed. I bought 7 mototrbikes before. And thankfully most of them now have a cut off switch at the side stand. If the side stand is down, clutch out for Suzuki G6, the engine cannot even start. If the side stand is down for the R1, the moment I engage gear, the engine will stall. All these come to help out as a safety net to prevent the rider from facing consequences of a moment's folly.<br><br>I also recall during a stressful day's work forgetting to release handbrake when I drove off. "How come the pick-up no power?" Then realised the handbrakes still on.<br><br>By right the signal indicators are supposed to off itself as your steering wheel is straightened after turning. But sometimes the signal indicator is faulty so you need to hit back yourself. But I also forget to off it sometimes. When riding motorbike, the signal indicator is fully manual. I also forgot to off before. And I cannot guarantee in future I will always remember to off it too.<br><br>The first time when I drove a continental car was an Opel Astra. I was so used to japanese right hand signal left hand wiper. Then when I turned out, I hit the 'signal' and the wiper came up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I also drove the Peugeot 1007 before. Optional tiptronic Gear shift is behind the steering wheel. Not quite used to it keep bringing to the wrong gear also.<br><br>All these are part and parcels of our lives on the roads. That is why we have to learn to foresee situations on the roads. In this way every road user watches each other's back for we will not know who will be the next to make mistakes.</div></blockquote>Opel Astra signal stalk on the left hand side? The Holden version has it the other way around. I always thought both cars were exactly the same.</div>
