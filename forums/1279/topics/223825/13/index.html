He would know better than to purposely stop at the pedestrian crossing. This is a 'bo pian' case, if you ask me. The BC got no choice. And please la, how much space do you need to avoid a pedestrian? Just shift right a bit, can already. You will pass the pedestrian safely while still remaining in your lane. It is not a big fuss, you know. Stop thinking so much.</div>
