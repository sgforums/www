I already said, Scanias and MKIIs (whether NAC or CAC) are older than VO2x. If noone mentioned about any fault with them, yet they can talk so much about SLBP buses, obviously something is wrong.</div>

Yeah, AMDEP also have buses with paint drop off but I'm sure they repaint it for better look.<br><br>You suggest SBS 507G (BRBP 154), I'll go and take it one day, if I found no prob then....dunno wat to say..., other forum members also can try it.
