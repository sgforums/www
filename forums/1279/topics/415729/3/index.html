              <p>If SBSTransit unable to handle, then open up the duopoly.</p>
              <p>SBSTransit will be more than willing to ply more services into Sembawang.</p>

              <p>SMRT refuses to provide more services in Sembawang for the same commuters will 'lan lan' end up taking trains.</p>
              <p>And whether it ends up taking train or bus, revenues remain the same.</p>
              <p>There is no incentives for SMRT to put up more trains or buses in Sembawang. The additional investment in new buses will not translate to more revenues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The story is different for SBSTransit. New buses investment for Sembawang by SBSTransit will translate to additional revenues, as some existing Sembawang train commuters will switch to SBSTransit buses.</p>
              <p>The trains are getting crowded these days. It's time for PTC and LTA to allow SBSTransit to ply into Sembawang, Yew Tee, CCK, to make our journey more comfortable.</p>

              <p>The breakdown for the quarter is:</p>
              <p>profit from bus operation: 3m</p>
              <p>profit from rail operation: 4.1m</p>
              <p>profit from advertisement: 10.2m</p>
              <p>profit from rental biz: 3.6m</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without the bus or rail operation, can the group achieve anything from advertisement?</p>
              <p>Profit from advertisement should be a component of profit from bus operation! Bus companies are smart to isolate the operations and advertisements revnues, for that warrant them the need for call for higher bus and rail fares.</p>

              <p><br>I don't agree with this system, especially such kind of stupid territory protectism. If a company have more than enough resources, then should let it serve other places as well, instead of keep on having some duplications in the same places that they serve. So in the end, LTA is just stepping their own toes by saying their disagreements on the bus train routes duplication. <br>And if another company does not have enough or unwillingly to cater more resources to introduce more bus services to the area they serve, then just let others do the connection. Don't let commuters suffer from all these poor bus service and connectivity and yet they have to bear such nonsense like annual fare increasse and poor service standards.</p>

              <p><br>I don't agree with this system, especially such kind of stupid territory protectism. If a company have more than enough resources, then should let it serve other places as well, instead of keep on having some duplications in the same places that they serve. So in the end, LTA is just stepping their own toes by saying their disagreements on the bus train routes duplication. <br>And if another company does not have enough or unwillingly to cater more resources to introduce more bus services to the area they serve, then just let others do the connection. Don't let commuters suffer from all these poor bus service and connectivity and yet they have to bear such nonsense like annual fare increasse and poor service standards.</p>

              <p><br>What to do? Everything they want to control. Now they want to control more to make it worse. Hub and spoke concept, imagine the number of transfers and time wasting, and travelling is going to get more frustrating and longer. <br><br>I have a collegue who have to make at least 3 transfers everyday to work, from Punggol to Suntec City. She complained that it is so tiring everyday just to travel to and especially from work. Why don't they just introduce a direct Express service from City to Punggol as well?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SMRT and SBS Transit should not operate both train and bus services together in the same town. <br><br>Inadequate services often provided. SBS Transit isnt so stingy, but SMRT is quite stingy. <br><br>Bukit Panjang LRT System is one example. All feeder services withdrawn to push commuters up the LRT, and only reintroduce minimal feeder services at 20 - 30 mins only when govt intervene.<br><br>Sembawang Town is one example also. They simply want all residents living there to take the MRT. All they do is to provide bridging service to Woodlands, Yishun and Sembawang MRT. The rest were services already in place. <br><br>Choa Chu Kang same thing. No basic bus services introduced in Yew Tee since takeover in 1999 when they could have amended 925 to go up and then head to Kranji Industrial Estate via Yew Tee.</p></div>

              <p>Urm. Sembawang Town is no where near Chong Pang. If you are walking you will probably take 20-30 mins. <br><br>167/980 transfer to 171 is the fastest way OR<br>MRT to Marsiling and take 187/963/966. <br><br>I say Sembawang people need bus services to Bedok / Sengkang / Boon Lay. <br>1) Extending 854 to Sembawang, <br>2) Amend 965 to serve Sembawang and <br>3) Extending 180 from Bukit Panjang to Sembawang (via 963 loop and then BKE/ Marsiling and then continue using 962's route to Sembawang) would be a wise choice.</p>

              <p><br>there's this problem with LTA for now.. though it does central bus planning, it still has to reach out to the community and both PTOs to reach a feasible solution on both sides. In a way LTA is like the middleman here and not the regulator. That's because if grassroots want an amendment of a service, and PTOs are unwilling due to lack of buses then there is nothing much LTA can do for the moment.</p>
              <p>I believe things will be different if a third operator steps in.. things will get more exciting that's for sure.</p>
