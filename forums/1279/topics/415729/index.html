              <p>Agreed. Sembawang area has lack of bus services all these while. Ever heard of services 852 and 857 planning to extend to Sembawang int from Yishun way back in 2007, but then?</p>
              <p>Services 167 and 980 doesn't really serve much difference as their routes run parallel from Sembawang Road to Novena MRT. The rest are only short haul routes.</p>
              <p>Feel that SMRT needs more improvements in Sembawang areas, compared to Sengkang and Punggol which SBST did enhance the bus routes in order to have more connectivity to other areas.</p>
              <p>The only thing that SMRT did was to divert service 858 to ply along Sembawang. Feel that either services 965 or 969 should also be diverted to ply along Sembawang too.</p>

              <p>It is logical that Sembawang doesn't get as much services. Why? First thing it's not as large as Yishun or Woodlands. The way Sembawang services is planned is to provide connectivity to nearby "hubs" - Yishun and Woodlands as well as basic connections to town (167, 980) and to the East direct (858). Why it's obvious? First two services to really ply within Sembawang town are 859 and 962. I prefer taking MRT to the West as it's really much faster compared to taking buses.</p>
              <p>As a resident there, I'm ok with the connectivities. However, I must say bus frequencies as well as the condition of buses have large rooms for improvement. At least now I feel there's slight improvement in day time frequency of 858.</p>

              <p>It is logical that Sembawang doesn't get as much services. Why? First thing it's not as large as Yishun or Woodlands. The way Sembawang services is planned is to provide connectivity to nearby "hubs" - Yishun and Woodlands as well as basic connections to town (167, 980) and to the East direct (858). Why it's obvious? First two services to really ply within Sembawang town are 859 and 962. I prefer taking MRT to the West as it's really much faster compared to taking buses.</p>
              <p>As a resident there, I'm ok with the connectivities. However, I must say bus frequencies as well as the condition of buses have large rooms for improvement. At least now I feel there's slight improvement in day time frequency of 858.</p>
