              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As many sgf transport enthus know i'm tintinspartan and i currently studying Media and Communication in Singapore Poly. I am asking on suggestions to whether or not to esthablish a Transport Enthusiast Club in Singapore Poly. SP has alot of CCAs with diversity of fields such as Sports (Canoe, Gym Club), Fashion (SP Makeup Artists Club) and others (SP Food Connosiuer). So there is nothing odd towards this idea since there are other odd interests that have been made CCAs in SP. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For this new club, we not only want to make a presence in the modern society that we exist but also share with others who might join due to oddity what is the hobby about but not only that. the club could attempt to create partnerships with the relevant transportation authorities such as LTA, SMRT and SBST in order to give youths more exposure to how our transportation systems work. This can come in the form of visit to rolling stock maintainance facilities and dialogue sessions with some key personnel who are responsible in maintaining the efficiency of the nation's transportation network.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How will things run in the club?</p>
              <p>The club will have at the least bi-weekly meetings where members can come together and discuss about transportation topics such as new developments and do stuff together such as engaging in board games and etcetra. It's more to recreation but to keep things relevant, we will attempt to have at least monthly outings to various transportation sites which have huge significance such as the Tanjung Pagar KTM Station.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This club although sounds as if only SP students is involved, will also attempt to have transport enthusiasts from other institutions to come together once in a while for a mass gathering like a bus tour, a tour at a transportation facility and even house-visiting during festive occasions. This will hopefully create more bonds between enthusiasts in SP and in other institutions such as RP, TP, NP and some secondary schools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, this club hopes to build relations with other transport enthusiasts whichever they are interested in from trains, buses, taxis and planes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In brief, the main purpose of this club is to:</p>
              <p>1) create relationships between enthusiasts and with members of general public who join due to oddity.</p>
              <p>2) make known to the transportation authorities that some youths are concerned for the nation's transportation system</p>
              <p>3) give youths more exposure to the day-to-day operations of the transportation network.</p>
              <p>4) have fun! :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope that this brief proposal should explain the rationale behind this club. Pls give your comments on this proposal. This club will be proposed to the relevant authorities in SP for approval if support is given.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>NOTE: IT IS NOT ONLY FOR BUS Enthus! Train, Plane and other TRANSPORTATION enthusiasts can join in.</p>

              IMO, we should make our bus enthusiast commitee more grand, make it official, then make bus fans join, and have membership card, so some unfriendly ask us who we are we still can show card tell them we from SBEC...

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For thos interested, the club has been proposed to the officer and here is his input:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) He doubt that it will appeal to the mass student population</p>
              <p>2) Need at least 50 people to join in before major consideration is taken (fear of a demise in interest towards the club) (SP has only a few enthusiasts)</p>
              <p>3) Too niche.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What the SP DSD(department of student development) officer has commented that it has plans to expand SP RCD (Remote Control Drifters) in terms of it's scope to include other vehicles such as buses and trucks and if it happens, it will be a closest fit for those interested in transportation to join.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In brief, the club will not be registered officially in SP yet but we will seek alternative channels. I heard suggestions from people whom i approached to proposing to MCYS which may take time. In the meantime, it will be an unofficial club.</p>
