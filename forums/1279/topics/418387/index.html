              <p><br>You've forgotten the other end of Sv 92's route. If suay suay all w/ side parking, tat's it. I happened to be onboard on one such incident.</p>
              <p>It's not abt tight roads, it's because compared to the kampong days i.e. single lane per direction carriageways, the roads are more 12m friendly.</p>

              <p>Enviro 400 is a 2 axle double deck, as good as VO2x.</p>
              <p>With resources being tight, going w/ 10.6m buses wun do well. Even so, you would end up w/ more net buses plying the roads/ bus stops. It's not desirable during peak hours.</p>
              <p>I think what more be done is to procure 2x ADDs. LTA work w/ NParks to reduce the no of roads/ stretches tat are double decker no go zone.</p>

              <p>Using smaller buses on less-demanding services with better frequencies would be much better than having a full 12m bus running empty or half-empty at a longer interval. For example, 882 is usually, at best, half-filled. Using a smaller bus like the Enviro200, MAN 14.220 would be more efficient fuel-wise, especially when the bus is not very heavily loaded. 354 also tends to run about with barely any passengers. Using smaller, more efficient buses here could be beneficial. However, it's only feasible if more services require smaller buses. It's not much use if only 1 or 2 services require these smaller buses, because maintenance costs will be relatively high.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Services I think have use for smaller buses: 926, 925C, 882, 354, 408 and 409, RWS8, RWS88, 927, 284.</p>

              <p>And as said, Hong Kong roads varies because of types of roads and most of them are all double deckers, regardless of lengths. So they can cope with the crowds even if the buses are shorter.</p>
              <p>However, over here it's 60% single deckers and 40% double deckers. Unless LTA approve and sponsor part of SBST's fleet renewal expenses for more double deckers, if not, how can shorter single deckers going to manage the commuter load in a crowded city like Singapore???</p>

              <p>Midi-buses are pharsing out here. Even 42 now can use 12m buses.</p>
              <p>What do you think??? Operators would rather use all standardised fleet as operating and maintanace costs are much more cost efficient.</p>
              <p>And as said, Hong Kong roads varies because of types of roads and most of them are all double deckers, regardless of lengths. So they can cope with the crowds even if the buses are shorter.</p>
              <p>However, over here it's 60% single deckers and 40% double deckers. Unless LTA approve and sponsor part of SBST's fleet renewal expenses for more double deckers, if not, how can shorter single deckers going to manage the commuter load in a crowded city like Singapore???</p>
              <p><br>But back then, then Ministry of Transport, did they approve 3 axles public buses in the first place??? Since the only first 3 axles public bus was the Leyland Olympian air con double decker in 1993.</p>

              <p>before citing examples with the VO2x, dennis dart and bendys, i'm referring to the majority.</p>
              <p>hong kong has many models which are 10.6, 10.3 or even 10.1m because of some bendy roads especially on hong kong island. nevertheless i think they are well suited for service.</p>
              <p>rather than having 12m as the smallest bus available, i would rather see higher frequencies made with shorter buses. a good example is the enviro 400 recently introduced in hong kong.</p>
              <p>just an idea. anyone who knows more details, or comments on the feasibility?</p>

              <p>As long as cost and efficiency is concerned to cater the increasing needs to serve the unnecessary population increase here, you can really say goodbye to all the short buses. Even service 42 is using B10Ms now.</p>
              <p>It's not like last time where we still have  around 10m Albion Vikings, and standard 12m ones. All these have became history since the 1990s.</p>
