              <p>Singapore lady complained of PRC bus drivers being ignorant of bus routes</p>
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">April 5, 2010</span></p>
              <p>An obviously peeved Singapore lady Ms Wong Kit Peng has written a letter to the Straits Times Forum today complaining about PRC bus drivers who “did not understand simple English and were ignorant of the routes they plied.”</p>
              </div>
              <p>She related two recent encounters with PRC bus drivers who were unable to comprehend her queries:</p>
              <p><em>“In the first case – SBS Transit service 151 – I asked if the bus stopped at National Junior College. The driver had difficulty with my query, even though I repeated the location a few times. The same thing happened on SMRT service 852, when I asked if the bus went to Selegie Road and Peace Centre,”</em> she wrote.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong wondered why SBS and SMRT are now hiring bus drivers with doubtful English language proficiencies and knowledge of the bus routes.</p>
              <p>She thought they are doing so to cut costs:</p>
              <p><em>“If bus companies have trouble hiring drivers, perhaps it is time to improve their pay. It is better to cut costs by, say, going green than hiring drivers who hurt service quality,”</em> she ended her letter.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong cannot be more wrong if she thinks that Singapore bus companies are recruiting PRC bus drivers because they are cheaper.</p>
              <p>According to a Sichuan newspaper, an unknown “big” Singapore bus company is currently mass recruiting prospective bus drivers from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, China. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/03/25/%e6%96%b0%e5%8a%a0%e5%9d%a1%e5%85%ac%e5%8f%b8%e5%88%b0%e6%88%90%e9%83%bd%e6%8b%9b%e8%81%98%e5%8f%b8%e6%9c%ba/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>The PRC applicants are offered annual salaries ranging between RMB90,000 and RMB120,000 (approximately $1,562 – $2,082 monthly taking S$1 = RMB4.80) and are also given free lodging, transport allowances and medical insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>The applicants must have a Chinese class “A” driver and three years of driving experience of public transport in China.</p>
              <p>With such attractive terms, it is highly unlikely that the company will encounter difficulties recruiting Singaporeans for the job.</p>
              <p>Are PRC nationals safer drivers than Singaporeans? Or are they more experienced? Perhaps the HR managers of SBS and SMRT should go to China and take their buses for a week and witness for themselves the “performance” of PRC bus drivers:</p>

              <p>Due the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-China policies, large number of Chinese from mainland China have flocked to Singapore to work, study and live in recent years, many of whom are unable to speak a single word of English.</p>
              <p>Unlike other countries like Australia and Canada, foreigners do not have to pass a basic English proficiency test to work in Singapore which explains the large number of PRC bus drivers who do not understand or speak English.</p>
              <p>PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew said in a recent interview with National Geographic magazine that it is a “good” thing that Singapore has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (from mainland China) as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” than locals.</p>
              <p>When your correspondent took a bus driven by a PRC bus driver and half-filled with PRC nationals along Geylang road lately, he almost thought he was in some third-tier city of China.</p>

              <p><br>there's always a group of ppl who trust their ears than their eyes.. no choice</p>
              <p>and that lady wants to improve their pay? can.. increase bus fare, commoners make noise and the cycle goes over and over again. The bus companies know its hard to run away from their services as the private companies cannot operate unauthorised routes and taxis are the most expensive mode of land public transport. So what they do is they cut costs the easy way out - employ people who are willing to work at the rate the bus companies pay them. cant get locals? cant get enough malaysians? go china lor..</p>
              <p>The best way out for the bus companies is prudent investments that are able to earn returns as much as their fare revenue, if not more. However, due to the company structure of SMRT and SBST, SMRT has been a better buy than SBST.</p>

She wanted to get to aljunied... and the BC didn't know where it was. (Quite a strange question to be asked on 927). Someone else stepped it to translate.
