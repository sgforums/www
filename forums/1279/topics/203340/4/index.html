One example: http://www.metrotas.com.au/html/about.html<br><br>The European Union, including Sweden uses the term 'rigid bus': http://www.eu2001.se/static/ENG/issues/trans_telecom.asp<br><br>Even Eastern European countries like Romania use the term 'rigid bus' too:<br>http://www.ebrd.com/oppor/procure/opps/goods/tenders/060726a.htm<br><br>And if you check online encyclopedias like wikipedia, they use it too:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_O305<br><br>This is certainly bizarre behaviour from you.<br><br>Surely you must realise that anyone who is remotely interested in the subject can just google, learn about rigid buses and discover you are very, very wrong.<br><br>If you are trying to pull a fast one by misleading others through abusive language, you are certainly digging yourself into a deeper pit.<br><br>The issue is not even if you think the term 'rigid bus' is awkward sounding, or whether you like the term or not. The issue is if the term exists, and is used around the world. Surely you can grasp this simple point.<br><br>Don't try to pull a fast one, by pretending you were misunderstood earlier, or shift the posts of the issue by agreeing *now*, and then moving it to something else.<br><br>If you don't like the term 'rigid bus'- too bad. But you can't stop other countries from using it, and you can't stop others from pointing out that the term is commonly used in other countries.<br><br>So far, your reaction is to abuse others by calling them all sorts of names. That's just a poor reflection of your intellectual ability and maturity. It's almost as if you believe (or try to delude yourself that way) that the more nasty names you label others, the easier it is to change reality. Or maybe you just think others are easily deceived.<br><br>But the facts remain. You can't change them.<br>Anyone who wants to learn about 'rigid buses', just do a google, and read up.<br><br>It's time that you educate yourself too gohby  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>Now now, Silverkris, do you know something called typo error? I am not perfect, so why harp on something that (99.9999%) of computer users make? (Ie. typo error). What has that got to do with English standard? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I wont try to distract others by saying you are harping on issues such as typo error or derogatory names by saying you are "diverting other's attention" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Perhaps you would like to know something, that neither am I trying to desperately saving my face, nor trying to come up with a response to salvage myself. I see it more like an intellectual debate, where u present yr points and I present mine. Why should I  "save my face"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Did I deny the fact that many people uses "rigid bus"? What did I comment about it? I said it was an "awkward expression". Did I justify myself?<br><br>Now, have u tried looking how many percent of your "3760000 entries" on rigid bus is actually relevant to our discussion here?<br><br>Thank you for doing such an extensive research trying to "educate" me.<br>Yes, your websites clearly shows many people in the world uses "rigid buses", but dont u see the point of this discussion?<br><br>My point is: Rigid buses is not an accurate term to describe buses. (This is like the how many time that I am repeating; all bus bodies are rigid) I can say rigid articulated buses and you cant fault me, I can also say rigid VSO, rigid Mercedes-Benz_O305 and you cant fault me. The word rigid doesnt explicitly explain "Non-articulated buses". So thats why I said the expression was awkward.<br><br>Did I agree on the usage of "rigid buses"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I still dont. Like I said, I didnt deny many people worldwide are using rigid buses, and neither am I denying your right from pointing that out. As for the point on verbal abuses, perhaps its high time for you to realise that I am merely reciprocating your verbal abuses on me. (gohby doesnt have a good grasp of english). If you are too sensitive, too bad.<br><br>In conclusion, like what u said, the facts will always remain and no one (me or you) can change them. Your point is people worldwide are using the term "rigid buses" and my point is that "rigid busesÂ” is not an accurate term to single out non-articulated buses". Thats all! So Simple! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

Extremely ironic.<br><br>"Looks like you are the ones with *RIGID brains* (23 Sept)"<br>---- hahaha! A superficial attempt to be intelligent by linking 'rigid buses' to 'rigid brains'- the irony is you can't accept the reality that you are wrong, and others who point this out are 'rigid'.<br><br>- Show me concrete evidence that i cant accept the reality that I am wrong? cannot right? there you go again, jumping into assumptions. should I assume that your name is Mr. Assume since u love to assume?<br><br>- Woah!<br><br>-Like I said, you are desperately running out of points that you have to include such meaningless points in. try harder =)<br><br>----hahaha! One of my favourites- you already demonstrated you are uncouth- why are you pretending to be adverse to typing out "assssss"<br><br>- I am glad I made you so happy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>"perhaps its high time for you to realise that I am merely reciprocating your verbal abuses on me. (24 Sept)"<br>----   Double irony!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I only made ONE comment. You responded with MANY insecure 'face-saving" rants. And they are certainly abusive, making my ONE comment look VERY polite in contrast. hehe!<br>Perhaps you know reason is not on your side, and hence the only way you can retaliate is to proceed on a mad outburst/onslaught  of insults hahaha!<br><br>- If i really want my "face" so much would I have apologised? Now look, I must say you are so gentlemanly and forgiving! And wow, your posts are so mild and not abusive indeed.<br>- Ahha! Jumping to conclusions again! "perhaps you know" ... How you know what i was thinking? Who are you to even assume I know reason was not on my side? And yes, who is the one that is proceeding with a mad outburst/ onslaught of insults? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>"If you are too sensitive, too bad. (24 Sept)"<br>----  Triple irony! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> *You* are the sensitive one. You can't stand people pointing out a fact. Your English is BAD (understatement here hehe!). One mistake is a typo. I can even be charitable and accept two mistakes. But your "typos" are regular features, and that makes it BAD English.<br><br>- Alas, harping on "English" again (or should i say typing)! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> You sure have difficulties digesting the fact that typos have nothing got to do with english standard. Poor thing.<br><br>"My point is: Rigid buses is not an accurate term to describe buses. (24 Sept)"<br><br>---- Oh? Transport authorities around the world, universities, mayors, the European Union are *all wrong*, and *only* you know the right way to put it EH? *Only* you are qualified, and possess the authority to label buses correctly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>- Like what I said, you sure jump into assumptions very easily! Did I say I am qualified? Did I say I am the only right person to label things? I obviously didnt. You merely assumed it yourself. Goodness gracious.<br><br>"I will not change my opinion on the term "rigid buses" (24 Sept)"<br>---- Yeah, *we know* that. Despite the list of links produced to show you that 'rigid buses' is widely used globally. Only *you* can be right heh!<br><br>- Am I so belligerent? If I was, would I admit my mistake? Looks like you are running out of points to such an extent that you have to come up with nonsensical points that are against you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And yeah, dont try to act cool with your <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> .

Yes, Scania proved that I am wrong, so I apologised. However, you dug out all the past few posts stained and magnified all my points with a loudspeaker, hopefully to shoot me down. That is so gentlemanly indeed! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I am sorry, I am not least hurt by your remarks, all I can say is, try harder next time!<br></div>

Of course, we are aware you apologized to Scania, if only to offend fewer people with your ignorance. But what about the others? CanÂ’t remember their nicks?

            <div class='col-md body'>PART TWO<br><br>---- What points can you possibly be referring to? Hahaha! In fact, I see an obvious point- your avoidance of acknowledging you are wrong about the use of Â‘rigid bus, and your lack of contrition towards Stooper. Of course, we are aware you apologized to Scania, if only to offend fewer people with your ignorance. But what about the others? CanÂ’t remember their nicks? Again, while you are compiling a list of your grammatical errors, look out for these as well. Hehehe.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>- Oh dear! You need ladybird books desperately! Your level of comprehension is so appalling! I said Â“If I had offended anyone with my previous posts, i sincerely apologise.Â” That post was meant to offer my apologies to ANYONE whom I have offended, (ie. Stooper, you, as well as other people whom might have been misled by me). Poor thing! There is nothing bombastic in my sentence, however, you failed to understand such a simple sentence. Sigh.<br><br>---- Be assured that the day I depend on you for my happiness is the day when you will kneel down in front of Stooper and beg for forgiveness. So how, old boy? Will happen a not? I think we know the answer already. Hahahaha!<br><br>- Apparently you are Â“enjoyingÂ” yourself so thoroughly when you were rebutting all my points. No, you were not depending on me? This shows that all your Â“<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> =), whatsoever are just a faÃ§ade? LOL!<br><br>---- How do thou flatter me? Let me count the waysÂ…Â…Â…..oh no, the examples are far too many! Rhetorical questions- with answers evident to all.  Hahahaha! Scroll up and use your brains to come up with answers. No, I mean it- *REALLY* use your brains and think- just this ONCE ok? DonÂ’t shoot your mouth off. Hahaha!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>-	Why, you also need help in basic mathematical counting (1+1+1+1Â…)? !! Gosh. Now, I am really worried for you. Or you cant find enuff examples? Why should I shoot my mouth off? Goodness gracious! So extreme. Thankfully, I donÂ’t have such extreme mentalities which you possess.<br><br>Â“Alas, harping on "English" again (or should i say typing)!  You sure have difficulties digesting the fact that typos have nothing got to do with english standard. Poor thing.Â”<br><br>---- Beng ah! Misspellings reflect poor language standards. You can digest that or not HAR? I oready tok tok your style. You tink bad spelling = good engrish, high hi stanlard MEH?<br>OrrrrrrrrrrrrÂ…your idea of good engrish is writing littered with Â‘typosÂ’ LOR- all nothing one!

ThatÂ’s y I say hor, you nid ladybird books lor! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Â“Like what I said, you sure jump into assumptions very easily! Did I say I am qualified? Did I say I am the only right person to label things? I obviously didnt. You merely assumed it yourself. Goodness gracious.Â”<br><br>---- Goodness gracious me! (notice I added Â“meÂ”, so donÂ’t say I copy you HOR, unlike you Hehehe!) You must have forgotten how you told others to shut up because they corrected you on your mistakes! You MORE than *SAID* you are qualified; in fact you **demonstrated** this through your behaviour, your juvenile insults, and your attempts to silence all who dared to point out your errors. Why, you need Â“evidenceÂ” again? Scroll through your own posts LAH!<br><br>- Haha! Lol! You see HOR, all your points are emphasising Â“juvenile insultsÂ”, Â“attempting to silence peopleÂ”. Sorry to disappoint you AH, I am not Joseph Stalin LOR. I got hinder ppl to point out my mistakes AH? Which posts states that AH? OOOOR, its another of your assumption again LA! (ASSUMPTION NO. 7)<br><br>---- I come up with nonsensical points that are against myself?? ThatÂ’s your job- you keep slapping yourself with contradictory words. And you canÂ’t stand it when people point out your own contradictions.<br>Wah!!! You really lost it AH? What points? I donÂ’t see any new points from you LEH. Just constant Â“flatteryÂ” through imitation, and plagiarism of my text. Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>-	I shall not repeat what is my purpose of using your text again lor. I then not so bo liao like you la!<br>-	I cant stand ppl pointing out my contradictions MEH? Oh, so dumb of me to realise, its ASSUMPTION NO. 8! =)<br><br>---- Hahaha! HUH!?! Using emoticons is acting cool?! Every one uses them in public forums, including *YOU*. So are you acting cool too by using them liberally in your previous posts? Hahaha! Or is that another instance of your spaced-out illogical behaviour?<br>*You* should try harder instead i.e. consider your responses, and how they affect perceptions of your intellectual ability. Your own ill-considered retorts can actually turn around and *smack* your face, ya know! Hehe!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>- Many people use emoticons in different context. I also use emoticons. However, I use them to bring out my true expression of my face. But for you AH, (ah-hem), hehe!<br>- Smack my face ah, wait long long LOR. Want me to smack my face? The probability of me smacking my face becos of this is equivalent to the probability of you doing some personal reflection on yourself! =D n_n<br><br>I am merely refreshening your memory of your past verbal abuse. Showing you evidence is *hardly* magnifying them. Of course you are not used to evidence being placed in front of you in black-and-white. Your style has always been to make things up, and *pretend* they are real. Hahaha!<br>If you are afraid others will read your uncouth words, donÂ’t post them in the first place. Or do the cowardly thing- remove all of them. Hahaha! Otherwise, they will be there for a long time, to be enjoyed by all who wish to have a few laughs at your expense. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>- Aiyo, which of my posts states that I remove my so called uncouth words ah? No right? Show me some LA! Hence, this sentence, Â“Your style has always been to make things up, and *pretend* they are real.Â” Already refuted your argument perfectly fine!<br>- You merely show me evidence only MEH? Lol, with all the addition of your so-sensible words, certainly Â“does notÂ” magnify the whole thing.<br>- Laugh lor! You can laugh at my comments for all I care (are you, hope you are!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) As far as I am concerned, as far as I am enjoying what I am doing now, I donÂ’t care if you laugh at my comments (Who are you anyway?)<br><br>And really, you over-estimate your self-importance- I wouldnÂ’t lift a finger and expend effort to Â“HURTÂ” you. Are you feeling hurt already since the idea has already occurred to you? I hope not, old boy!<br><br>-	Oh! Oh! I am so hurt! Â“WAAAH! WAAAH!Â” DonÂ’t life 1mm of your finger to hurt me, I am so fragile! *sobs.<br>-	LOL!!!<br><br>Alas, I have found 8 assumptions solely based on these 2 meagre posts of yours. (Not inclusive of the countless assumptions which youÂ’ve made in the earlier posts). I salute you man! So far in my life, I havenÂ’t encountered a person who loves to assume as much as you.

            <div class='col-md body'>PART ONE<br><br>Gohby my dearestÂ…<br><br>You mistake my kind intentions. I am merely saving you from your self-destructive behaviour. But as I noted in the last two responses- you have become a changed person indeed! No more crudities like Â‘spasticÂ’, Â‘uncultured idiotÂ’, Â‘shut upÂ’ and Â‘idiocyÂ’. What caused this personality change? Can it possibly be shame?!? ItÂ’s so unlike your usual crude self- used to retaliating via targeting the messenger, and ignoring the message! Stooper and gang will be so pleased, and all my efforts at Â“reformingÂ” you would have been worth it!<br><br>Â“What a flawless description of yourself!Â”<br>---- I accept part of that remark. It is indeed a flawless description technically, but the content is definitely more suited to describing you. Hehe.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Â“Do you know why I am able to use your sentences to comment about you? This simply shows your stataments are ironic, hence are applicable on you. All I see is that you are trying to paint me as someone who is egoistic and arrogant whose "self hated knows no limit". Er, hallo, if I am such, would I have apologised? Can you find better points to attack me next time instead of using the same thing over and over again (ie. Poor 'English!  or being too egoistic". I dont care how you think about me. You can think i am "determined to turn wrong into right, error into fact", but do i care? Does your mentality of me count? Nope. For the (dont know how many times i am repeating), I am sorry for the misunderstanding of the term "rigid bus". Oh wait, I am glad I made you so happy again!!!Â”<br><br>---- Yes I *KNOW* why you *plagiarize* my text, and itÂ’s not because of your clumsy reason. Oh no! ItÂ’s because you have nothing better to say! ItÂ’s because you canÂ’t think of anything logical and sensible to rebut! So what better way to hide your ignorance and give full play to your anger by passing off my words as your own!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Words are freely said. Now, if you didnÂ’t care, why would you be so worked up? Such emotional and furious responses! Such venom! ItÂ’s a bit like being an alcoholic really- the more vigorous your denial is, the more the opposite is true. Hahaha!<br><br>Of course I can let the fact on your poor English slip. ItÂ’s evident to all who have followed your posts anyway. Did it cause you too much trauma, to be reminded of your bad English repeatedly so that you have to complain about it all the time?<br><br>Oh, so now you are sorry about your misuse of Â“rigid busÂ” eh? I certainly hope so boy! Genuinely apologetic or just a ruse to get yourself off the hook quickly? ItÂ’s a case of being *GENUINELY* apologetic to all those people whom you insulted, but chose to keep quiet then?

Oh wait, I forgot you ran out of instances.Â”<br><br>---- I am certain your avoidance of using derogatory labels in the last few posts has not made my efforts futile. WhyÂ….in this post, you only have angry, acrid retorts, but no Â‘spasticÂ’ and Â‘idiocyÂ’ sort of crudities! Dramatic change LEH! You need evidence of your own actions, you look it up yourself in your own posts, ok boy? No one knows your bitter and twisted self better than you do. Hahahaha! And the only trap around here is the one you set yourself, and fall into so readily. Unlike you, I donÂ’t use underhand means, resort to manufacturing stories or pretend to suffer from amnesia.

Now, who is exposing his own flaws? Â“<br><br>----I think your hallucinations got the better of you, old boy. What I said was you should compile your own list of errors. If you are unable to remember what you read (another instance of selective amnesia?), you should re-read my posts until you do. ItÂ’s there for you to verify as many times as you wish. Hahaha! And aiyo..this particular paragraph is so convoluted only you can understand it!<br>I know!!! You hope to Â“divertÂ” attention away from your lack of points by disguising it in really bad EnglishÂ…so that itÂ’ll appear you said something, when actually, nothing has been said at all!

Acknowledging you used a word, then denying its semantic meaning under the pretext of Â“reading between the lines.Â” Why donÂ’t you read between my lines, and note the punctuation I employ to see if you caught my sub-text.

ItÂ’s a thorough enjoyment for them- their petulant ways have already been exposed. Their ignorance of Â‘rigid busÂ’ has already been demonstrated to everyone. They have nothing to lose, and so might as well enjoy the process of penance. Hahahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â”Oh dear! You need ladybird books desperately! Your level of comprehension is so appalling! I said Â“If I had offended anyone with my previous posts, i sincerely apologise.Â” That post was meant to offer my apologies to ANYONE whom I have offended, (ie. Stooper, you, as well as other people whom might have been misled by me). Poor thing! There is nothing bombastic in my sentence, however, you failed to understand such a simple sentence. Sigh.Â”<br><br>---- These books which you are so obsessed with- they are all yours, no worries. You are the one who refers to arithmetic as Â“basic mathematical countingÂ” among other hilarious examples. I urge you to make a list of errors quickly and learn from them!<br>More importantly, you are **apologizing** to me TOO? ThatÂ’s some news! I take this to mean you acknowledge your ignorance and your folly in insulting so many people. Hahahahaaha! O.K. I accept your apology! Hahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â“Apparently you are Â“enjoyingÂ” yourself so thoroughly when you were rebutting all my points. No, you were not depending on me? This shows that all your Â“    =), whatsoever are just a faÃ§ade? LOL!Â”<br><br>---- Again, what is this faÃ§ade you refer to? FaÃ§ade to concealÂ…Â….what, if any? HUH!??!?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Â“Why, you also need help in basic mathematical counting (1+1+1+1Â…)? !! Gosh. Now, I am really worried for you. Or you cant find enuff examples? Why should I shoot my mouth off? Goodness gracious! So extreme. Thankfully, I donÂ’t have such extreme mentalities which you possess.Â”<br><br>---- HeheheÂ….Â”basic arithmetic countingÂ” Come on, you can do better than that! Only you can give a persuasive response as to why you enjoy embarrassing yourself by shooting your mouth off,- correcting facts with wrong information, telling people to Â‘shut upÂ’, engaging in meaningless rants, and passing off text as your own via plagiarism. Hahahaha! EÂ’nuff said!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â“Aiyo boy ah, someone cant differentiate misspellings from typos hor? This shows how good your England or ingrisshh is la! You think wat? Got typo=misspellings=poor inkgrish? ThatÂ’s y I say hor, you nid ladybird books lor!  Â”<br><br>---- Aiyo! One error can be construed as a typo like I mentioned earlier. Ten, twenty are not. This is a rehash of a point which I have taken up.<br><br>My previous replies which you obviously missed out:<br><br>*****Misspellings reflect poor language standards. You can digest that or not HAR? I oready tok tok your style. You tink bad spelling = good engrish, high hi stanlard MEH?<br>OrrrrrrrrrrrrÂ…your idea of good engrish is writing littered with Â‘typosÂ’ LOR- all nothing one! And I have not even SAY anythik about *your* glammar! HAHAHAHA!<br><br>***** One mistake is a typo. In fact, I will even be generous and accept 2-3 typos. The fact remains your posts are littered with errors. So, I am quite justified in pointing out your English "stinks to high heaven."  I will spare you further embarrassment, but you may want to start by checking out "Scruntinise" in your latest post, and work your way up to other numerous "typos" hahaha!<br><br>Â“Haha! Lol! You see HOR, all your points are emphasising Â“juvenile insultsÂ”, Â“attempting to silence peopleÂ”. Sorry to disappoint you AH, I am not Joseph Stalin LOR. I got hinder ppl to point out my mistakes AH? Which posts states that AH? OOOOR, its another of your assumption again LA! (ASSUMPTION NO. 7)Â”<br><br>---- LetÂ’s see where you attempted to Â“bulldozeÂ” people so that they can avoid embarrassing you when they point out your errors:<br>"If your english is *pathetic*, kindly *shut up*. (23 Sept)"<br>"Now, Silverkris who is the *uncultured idiot* who has *limited vocabulary* (23 Sept)"<br>"No one will say you are spastic if you dont. Period. (24 Sept) to Stooper"<br>"if not, just keep your a55 out of this situation (24 Sept) to Stooper"<br>Happy now? You may not be Stalin, thatÂ’s true, but you are certainly no saint as you try to portray yourself now. Hahahahaha!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PART FOUR<br><br>Â“I shall not repeat what is my purpose of using your text again lor. I then not so bo liao like you la! I cant stand ppl pointing out my contradictions MEH? Oh, so dumb of me to realise, its ASSUMPTION NO. 8! =)Â”<br><br>---- Ahhh..the first explicit acknowledgement of plagiarism. You didnÂ’t just Â“useÂ” my text, you passed them off as your own! In the future, please use proper referencing if you need to quote me. But remember, appropriate quoting is fine. Cut-and-paste of large chunks of my text, and passing them off as your own is NOT. Hahahahahaha!<br>You canÂ’t stand people pointing out your contradictions too??- we all know why too! ItÂ’s because it places you in a negative light, and adds on to your poor repute here. DonÂ’t blame anyone but yourself though- you shot yourself in the foot, and ended up in this state! Hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â“Many people use emoticons in different context. I also use emoticons. However, I use them to aid my true expression of my face. But for you, (ah-hem), hehe!  Smack my face ah, wait long long LOR. Want me to smack my face? The probability of me smacking my face becos of this is equivalent to the probability of you doing some personal reflection on yourself! =D n_nÂ”<br><br>---- So you acting cool or not? DidnÂ’t you say people who use emoticons are acting cool? Now, thereÂ’s not a single word on this subject! Just absolute silence! Instead, your new excuse that it Â‘aids your true expression of face.Â” As usual, BAD ENGLISH! Why canÂ’t you try harder to articulate your ideas? Hahahahaha! And I am glad you learnt the word Â‘emoticonsÂ’Â…I was having trouble understanding what you were trying to say since you couldnÂ’t think of the right proper noun. Hahahaha!<br>Every post you put here is self-denigration anyway. To say that Â‘you slap your own faceÂ’ is just to put it mildly. Hahahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Â“Aiyo, which of my posts states that I remove my so called uncouth words ah? No right? Show me some LA! Hence, this sentence, Â“Your style has always been to make things up, and *pretend* they are real.Â” Already refuted your argument perfectly fine!<br>- You merely show me evidence only MEH? Lol, with all the addition of your so-sensible words, certainly Â“does notÂ” magnify the whole thing.<br>- Laugh lor! You can laugh at my comments for all I care (are you, hope you are! ) As far as I am concerned, as far as I am enjoying what I am doing now, I donÂ’t care if you laugh at my comments (Who are you anyway?)Â”<br><br>---- Blah blah blah, gibberish, gibberish, gibberish. More examples of unintelligible writing. Do you get bored when you read your own words? Do you actually understand what you write? Hahahaha!<br>One example ok, because I am unwilling to take on *your* task: Â“which of my posts *states*Â…Â…Â…Â”- what happened to subject-verb agreement? Hahahahaha!<br>You mean you canÂ’t recognize uncouth words from civil ones? You mean you canÂ’t distinguish between what is appropriate and what is not? Ask your mother. Or better, tell a stranger he is Â‘spasticÂ’ (which is what you said to Stooper) and see if your face swells up as a result of Â“the hard impact from a palm raining down on it.Â” Hahahahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â“Oh! Oh! I am so hurt! Â“WAAAH! WAAAH!Â” DonÂ’t life 1mm of your finger to hurt me, I am so fragile! *sobs. LOL!!!Alas, I have found 8 assumptions solely based on these 2 meagre posts of yours. (Not inclusive of the countless assumptions which youÂ’ve made in the earlier posts). I salute you man! So far in my life, I havenÂ’t encountered a person who loves to assume as much as you. Terrific job!Â”<br><br>---- Â“DonÂ’t life 1mm of your finger to hurt me, I am so fragile!Â” ErrrÂ….donÂ’t Â‘liftÂ’?? Another Â“typoÂ” or just plain BAD ENGLISH? Hahahaha! You see old boy, when you canÂ’t spell properly, your words lose their effect. If you donÂ’t want to spell properly, donÂ’t bother to post. And whatÂ’s the point of asking me to show you examples of your appalling language use when you donÂ’t do anything? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I hate to spoil the party- but you need to refer to Â“Your assumptionsÂ”- 10 points plus a bonus 11th point (earlier in the post) to see why you enjoy making things up, and attributing them to me. Hahahahaha! It was fun compiling this list too, just like the list of your verbal abuse. But come on, you can do a grammar list yourself, canÂ’t you? You have the easiest task of all, especially since I have helped you in this post by pointing out a *few* of your errors. Hahahaha! And so, all you need to do should you wish to meet a Â”I-am-making-this-upÂ” person is to look into the mirror!
