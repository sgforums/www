            <div class='col-md body'>Now now gohby, I won't comment on your English standard with your 'defination' instead of 'definition' and all.....<br><br>Iwon't try to launch an angry and *incorrect missive*like you, and call you derogatory names so as to *avoid the real issue* at hand, and try to distract others from facts.<br><br>Perhaps it is your way of saving yourself face, or your helpless response to public embarrassment when proven wrong.<br><br>It is a fact that 'rigid bus' is commonly used around the world.....even if SBS Transit doesn't use it.<br><br>If you do a google search (type 'rigid bus') you will find approximately 3760000 entries on the subject.<br><br>Here are a few examples for your education:<br><br>USA- The University of California, Los Angeles uses the term 'rigid bus':<br>http://peer.berkeley.edu/year6/yr6_projects/ta5/lifelines401b.html<br><br>United Kingdom: the Transport of London authority, and the Mayor of London use the term 'rigid bus': http://www.tfl.gov.uk/buses/downloads/accessibile_bus_stop_design_guidance.pdf#search=%22rigid%20buses%22<br><br>Australia: the Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales state governments all use the term 'rigid buses.' One example: http://www.metrotas.com.au/html/about.html<br><br>The European Union, including Sweden uses the term 'rigid bus': http://www.eu2001.se/static/ENG/issues/trans_telecom.asp<br><br>Even Eastern European countries like Romania use the term 'rigid bus' too:<br>http://www.ebrd.com/oppor/procure/opps/goods/tenders/060726a.htm<br><br>And if you check online encyclopedias like wikipedia, they use it too:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_O305<br><br>This is certainly bizarre behaviour from you.<br><br>Surely you must realise that anyone who is remotely interested in the subject can just google, learn about rigid buses and discover you are very, very wrong.<br><br>If you are trying to pull a fast one by misleading others through abusive language, you are certainly digging yourself into a deeper pit.<br><br>The issue is not even if you think the term 'rigid bus' is awkward sounding, or whether you like the term or not. The issue is if the term exists, and is used around the world. Surely you can grasp this simple point.<br><br>Don't try to pull a fast one, by pretending you were misunderstood earlier, or shift the posts of the issue by agreeing *now*, and then moving it to something else.<br><br>If you don't like the term 'rigid bus'- too bad. But you can't stop other countries from using it, and you can't stop others from pointing out that the term is commonly used in other countries.<br><br>So far, your reaction is to abuse others by calling them all sorts of names. That's just a poor reflection of your intellectual ability and maturity. It's almost as if you believe (or try to delude yourself that way) that the more nasty names you label others, the easier it is to change reality. Or maybe you just think others are easily deceived.<br><br>But the facts remain. You can't change them.<br>Anyone who wants to learn about 'rigid buses', just do a google, and read up.<br><br>It's time that you educate yourself too gohby  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
