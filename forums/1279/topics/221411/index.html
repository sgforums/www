            <div class='col-md body'>Well... SBST already introduced some new "expressway" services such as 52, 59, the FFW services, etc in the past one year, and I foresee they won't introduce more "expressway" services for the time being... If you ask them to introduce new service from east to west, they will probably tell you to make use of existing service... like taking 59 and then transfer to 52 at Bishan... You ask them for faster services, they will introduce "premium" services such as 506 and 30e to suck your money. Of course, bus companies can find many other excuses such as avoiding duplication of competitor's routes, not enough demand for such new services, the plan not approved by PTC, blah blah blah...<br><br>On the other hand, I really hope that KPE and the Bartley Road Extension will be opened asap...

I'm getting sick of all the jams along PIE and the roads around Kaki Bukit/Eunos already...)

I support the idea. Perhaps travelling from Eunos to Clementi will be faster if I take 966 and transfer to 52 along PIE (and I don't need to squeeze on the MRT and stand all the way... Haha) Maybe it's also a good idea to have a bus stop along PIE somewhere between Jln Eunos and Aljunied Rd, since the area is densely populated and passengers can transfer between 23, 59, 506 and 966... (If there are bus stops along AYE and the central part of PIE, I don't see why LTA can't build new bus stops along the eastern and western parts of PIE...)</div>

Perhaps travelling from Eunos to Clementi will be faster if I take 966 and transfer to 52 along PIE (and I don't need to squeeze on the MRT and stand all the way... Haha) Maybe it's also a good idea to have a bus stop along PIE somewhere between Jln Eunos and Aljunied Rd, since the area is densely populated and passengers can transfer between 23, 59, 506 and 966... (If there are bus stops along AYE and the central part of PIE, I don't see why LTA can't build new bus stops along the eastern and western parts of PIE...)</div></blockquote>Some replies from SBST, SMRT, LTA found in newspapers why certain Expressway cannot has bus stop :<br><br>1. Jams leading to some exits along PIE during peak hrs, wkends/PHs<br>2. Blacklisted Accident Zone<br>3. Affect flow of traffic<br>4. High speed, 80-90km/h<br>5. Blah... Blah... Blah...<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>FYI, AYE is upgraded from Ayer Rajah Rd to link to the new ECP then.<br>Thus the bus stops previously at Ayer Rajah Rd are relocated to AYE in order to minimise inconvinence caused to people taking bus svcs previously at Ayer Rajah Rd.</div>

One problem is, are you sure the route is possible since there is no link between mandai rd and sle(tpe)? You can only do that via mandai avenue and if you make a u turn at mandai avenue.</div>
