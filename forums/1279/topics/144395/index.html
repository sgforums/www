            <div class='col-md body'>Understand from previous statements by LTA that there was a plan to develop such a system with SMRT and SBS transit.<br><br>Such a system would effectively assist communters in deciding which bus to take given that they can view the approaching times of each bus at the bus stop.<br><br>At the same time, some form of punctuality would be practiced on buses to ensure they meet their schedules. The issue of multiple buses arriving at the same time can also be monitored and solved accordingly.<br><br>With the cotinued increase in bus fares, perhaps more measures can be made to implement such a system instead of the failed concept of TV mobile.<br><br>Seriously, i'd rather pay more for a modern/upgraded bus chassis or a GPS network that helps me decide which bus to take then to waste money on meaningless in-bus entertainment systems.<br><br></div>

Even the smaller towns have been incorporated.<br><br>And one thing: AVMS is not supposed to be hindered by jams. It basically tells the commuter what the ETA at that particular bus stop is. Whether the commuter chooses to wait or take an alternate bus is entirely the commuter's decision.<br><br>That's what the system was meant to do: grant choices to the commuter.

            <div class='col-md body'>Err.. the system to install ETA info at bus stops (Transit.smart) has been canned. Thus.. AVMS is not going to benefit commuters at bus stops, perhaps only at bus interchanges.<br><br>Other countries.. AVMS is useful cos long headways.. buses can regulate speed to be on time. Buses also got space to idle at bus stops. Sg.. headways relatively short, bus lanes cramped.. seriously.. benefits.. I dunno..<br><br>I believes bus fleets are deployed to it's fullest efficiency. If got jam, I doubt there are buses/drivers available to fill the gap just because there is jam. What can happen ... is asking buses that have bunched up.. ask 1 of them to skip stops to leapfrog in front. But.. dun think commuters at bus stops like to see buses not stopping for them.<br><br>But I believe.. if got bus breakdown.. and a replacement bus is coming out, the replacement bus can accurately join the chain where the headway is longest. Another benefit is the deployment of short working trip buses, where the driver can feedback "live" where got crowd rather than based on fixed schedules.</div>

Thus.. AVMS is not going to benefit commuters at bus stops, perhaps only at bus interchanges.<br><br>Other countries.. AVMS is useful cos long headways.. buses can regulate speed to be on time. Buses also got space to idle at bus stops. Sg.. headways relatively short, bus lanes cramped.. seriously.. benefits.. I dunno..<br><br>I believes bus fleets are deployed to it's fullest efficiency. If got jam, I doubt there are buses/drivers available to fill the gap just because there is jam. What can happen ... is asking buses that have bunched up.. ask 1 of them to skip stops to leapfrog in front. But.. dun think commuters at bus stops like to see buses not stopping for them.<br><br>But I believe.. if got bus breakdown.. and a replacement bus is coming out, the replacement bus can accurately join the chain where the headway is longest. Another benefit is the deployment of short working trip buses, where the driver can feedback "live" where got crowd rather than based on fixed schedules.</div></blockquote>It's foolish to can a system that is beneficial to commuters and drivers alike.<br><br>Just another LTA harebrained decision which invested probably several thousands of dollars to test and in the end,  conveniently abandon a viable system. What accountability can these people who take 'expensive lessons' be taken to task for? Tax payers dollars down the drain.<br><br>And you're wrong abt the system not being effective when jams and such are involved. It is PRECISELY the reason that such delays should be prompted to commuters so they can decide on the fastest alternative bus to get home. Isn't it the common inquisition of every commuter at a bus stop to ask: when's the bus coming?<br><br>Aren't we all concerned that we wait so long for our bus, and when it does come, it arrives in pairs? Or that the current paper times indicated at select bus stops are not adhered to?<br><br></div>

AVMS is a whole package of many sub-systems, one of which maintains schedule adherence, and the other (planned in the future) to provide ETA info. but right now, we refer to AVMS as the system that does schedule adherence cos they have not put in place the ETA info system yet.<br></div>

Sanyo supplies and installs the in-vehicle units IVU-300 across the entire fleet.<br><br>the total contract is worth US$19.5mln, with Orbital taking US$13mln and Sanyo $6.5mln.</div>

No loudspeaker system is needed. Just take a look at the loudhailing system on MRT trains. They didn't last very long. Now the kawasaki trains having adopted a Digital display seems more presentable to passengers.<br><br></div>
