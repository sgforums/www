              <p>Yeah, boast? Bosating makes you good? Even I hardly boast when I'm good at certain things.</p>
              <p>I'm not capable of good photos, so? It's not like as if I don't know certain basics of photography. DO you think everyone is an idiot since you're so good? There are people better than you, and even those lousier don't deserve the fucking slightest bit of insult.</p>
              <p>Do I deserve to be insulted? And mind you, the driver was parked there, I was not taking photos of him while he was driving on the move.</p>
              <p>You use your brain before telling others to do so.</p>

              <p>Let's look back at the chronology.</p>
              <p>You never posted about my photo. And the first post you made about it was an insult, with the usage of words such as 100% noob, idiot, useless photo?</p>
              <p>Oh, advice. Yes, GENIUS, that's advice.</p>
              <p>I think you <strong>honestly</strong> need some english lessons. Please go back to primary school, I'm sure those are taught if they're meant as insults or advices there.</p>

              <p>If i am not mistaken, you have not given any advise. All you did was to..... scold people, tell people off in a more than unfriendly way. The advise came from other members. Anyway, it has been a slow night. Thanks for the fun. I'm out of here.</p>

              <p><br>I don't see it being posted anywhere within the forum, so it is very difficult for new photographers to know the photography rules on buses if i am in this forum page (maybe create a sticky? but too much stickies already) . Besides if its a one off incident you can let him know nicely. It does not warrant an argument over this.</p>
              <p>Seriously simple_boi, do not lose your cool over this. I am certain you do not want to be starting a "flame war" over this matter. Unless you want to blow up this forum.</p>

              <p>For that matter, stop changing your statement.</p>
              <p>You said you only scold when you repeatedly give advice and the member doesn't heed it. For a fact, this is the first photo I've ever posted, and I get a scolding.</p>
              <p>Now you turn the tables around and say, first photo so what? You have not even seen any of my photos, nor given any of your so called "advice", which I'll find extremely unneccesary as I doubt I want to learn anything from <strong>an ego-boosted idiot</strong>. Are your photos any USEFUL? To any non bus fans, your photos are probably USELESS.</p>
