              <p>Actually from the safety point of view, it is best not to use flash on moving vehicles at night. I bet many of you have tried before, especially with cameras with strong flashes, the result could be similar to that of a flash bang, temporary blinding a person. Usual flashes will make you see colours. These will pose threats to road users.<br><br>Hope you see my point, and I don't take photographs of buses.</p>

              <p>Take it from a driver's perspective.  You're in command of a 12 tonne vehicle in heavy traffic.  A small car cuts infront of you but you don't realise because a tourist in a nearby park has taken a photo using a flash.  The distraction was enough for the bus to run a red light and nearly rear-end the small car, which, had it not been for the good brakes of the bus, could have possibly killed the driver and passenger. </p>
              <p>How do I know this?  It's happened to someone I know, and similar circumstances have happened to me.  DON'T USE YOUR FLASH!  Drivers have enough distractions from passengers asking questions to rowdy school kids.  They don't need another thing to make their job tougher.  It is even worse at night because it can momentarily dazzle the driver, but the bightness of the flash also remains imprinted on the retina, making it hard to judge distances for a moment. </p>
              <p>Again I say, PLEASE REFRAIN from FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY! </p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Aiyo, the argument hasn't ceased ah? I'm just going to opine honestly on this matter.</p>
              <p>Firstly, I think we've got to agree, and tackle the root cause of this argument - that is n4l snapped a photo using flash at night. I do agree that using flash at night, irregardless whether the bus is stationary or not, inflicts a degree of disturbance to the bus driver, though the extent of disturbance is subjective. So, n4l, please refrain from using your flash in the future. :) It might be so that you own a camera that is not the most ideal for taking night shots, but it's alright! Even if you don't use flash, and your photos turn out to be awful, its okay, you can learn from that experience and slowly improve. I don't judge the photographer by the quality of photos per se, but I judge the photographer by the <strong>genuine willingness to learn and improve</strong>. Having said that, I'd also like to appeal to the others to be more tolerating of mediocre photos, taken by budding photographers, as everyone, even the most professional photographers start from zilch. So, n4l, I hope this experience will not deter you from taking night shots and posting your pictures up. I'm sure a handful (though not all, sadly) of us will appreciate your effort, regardless how abysmal your photo can be. Just don't use your flash at night! All the best! :)</p>
              <p>On a less amicable tone, I really think it is a shame that <strong>I see egoism, boastfulness and intolerance, at its best, in this forum.</strong> It is pretty apparent who is guilty of these sins, but I'm not going to censure the culprit, as he has a proven record of resembling a stubborn wooden block and epitomising a totally egoisitic bigot. So I'm going to be wise and not going waste my breath here. :)</p>
              <p>On a parting note, I'd like to say, from a 3rd party point of view, its very obvious who is escalating the matter and who is more right. It is also quite known, for a fact, that those who criticise haughtily are likely to be those who feel very empty and insecure, so they have to boost their low self-worth by lashing out on others who are weaker in some aspects. How saddening! As the cliche proverb suggests, "Pride comes before a fall". :)</p>
              <p>Cheers and peace out!</p>

              <p>I wish the parties involved would  just shut up. </p>
              <p>On an online forum, where your tone of voice cannot be easily identified, misunderstanding others is easy. I once also took a pic of TIB619Z with flash. After that, I boarded the bus and apologised to the driver. He said he didn't really mind, but others may. He also told me not to use flash again, because it can obstruct and distract drivers.</p>
              <p>Flash photography should be avoided, even if it means missing a rare cameo or something. Accidents can happen, especially for inexperienced drivers.</p>
              <p>Both parties are at fault, one for taking a pic with flash (hope you learn), one for acting like a stuck-up know it all. Nobody's Perfect, you know. We all just have to learn. Back in 2006, when I started posting pics, I was given quite a few pointers by other members, albeit in a nice and friendly tone. Now, flame wars are common, harsh tones and insults are tossed at each other. </p>

              <p>haiz .... i just have to say being a bus fan isn't really about taking photos of buses , be yourself , do your own ways ,ignore crap from others , for some bus fans , the prefer taking photos of buses , but for others may not , maybe many do joyrides instead , but for those who are trying to take photos of buses due to peer pressure by other bus fans , give them a try ? it may not turn out good but it's a good learning process , like what Oceane said HK bus fans are so much better and enjoyable , their photos don't have porper sun light , just take for de sake of see-ing service and rego can le , why must it be everything nice nice? i'm a bus fan who hardly take photos of bus except sometimes i do night shots , i can say my photos isn't really good as long as i enjoy myself . It becomes stressful when you die die must take nice photos Being a bus fan i guess it's not about stress , just enjoy yourself and do what you want , other peopl's photo not nice ? don't bother , if you think you're going to post something negative , refrain from posting then , flame wars will occur ...</p>

              <p>I don't take picture of bus photos unless there is a rare cameo (e.g. SBS8030L on Express 502/502A).</p>
