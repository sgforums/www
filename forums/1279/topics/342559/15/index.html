              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Firstly, I think we've got to agree, and tackle the root cause
              of this argument - that is n4l snapped a photo using flash at
              night. I do agree that using flash at night, irregardless whether
              the bus is stationary or not, inflicts a degree of disturbance to
              the bus driver, though the extent of disturbance is subjective. So,
              n4l, please refrain from using your flash in the future. :) It
              might be so that you own a camera that is not the most ideal for
              taking night shots, but it's alright! Even if you don't use flash,
              and your photos turn out to be awful, its okay, you can learn from
              that experience and slowly improve. I don't judge the photographer
              by the quality of photos per se, but I judge the photographer by
              the <strong>genuine willingness to learn and improve</strong>.
              Having said that, I'd also like to appeal to the others to be more
              tolerating of mediocre photos, taken by budding photographers, as
              everyone, even the most professional photographers start from
              zilch. So, n4l, I hope this experience will not deter you from
              taking night shots and posting your pictures up. I'm sure a handful
              (though not all, sadly) of us will appreciate your effort,
              regardless how abysmal your photo can be. Just don't use your flash
              at night! All the best! :)</p>

              <p>I've never taken photos of buses and don't really intend to. I just so happened to be playing around with my camera that day and threw this photo up.</p>
              <p>And yes, I got the point about using flashes...</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have shot photos for quite a number of years, and perhaps the
              bus community is a place where I hear the most funny and
              restricting protocols, really...</p>
              <p>In photography as a general term, <strong>there should not be
              too many rules to restrict how a photo should be shot</strong>, and
              there are <strong>no hard and fast rules</strong> either. There may
              be some tricks like 'rule of thirds' and so on, but they should be
              only regarded as tricks and not how you should be governed to make
              your pictures look nice.</p>
              <p>I have tried to share with some folks around me to try these
              tricks commonly used in commercial photography, but I feel being
              shunned every time. Bus must be well lighted, bus must be in the
              center. I even got flamed by god-knows-who about a Scania N113
              being posed in the 'rule of thirds' with a battery powered rubbish
              collector. <strong>What is the constant refusal in accepting new
              ideas?</strong></p>
              <p>Maybe no one has seen my potential, maybe people do not know me
              well. I feel sad again and again when these commercial tricks were
              put to waste just because there was a trend set about how a bus
              photo should be taken.</p>
              <p>Then again, <strong>I am not the best</strong>. But experience
              on the field is important. <em>While you guys have shot bus photos
              on the street for the past number of years, I have shot on
              community levels all the way to international levels</em>. Its only
              recently that i have joined the bus theme, and its also recently
              that i have left it... Retired for good until I can find what i
              should shoot, <strong>instead of grabbing a thousand-dollar camera
              just to shoot something on the streets and call myself a
              'street-photographer' which any uncle or auntie can
              do.</strong></p>
              <p>I have ever thought of the fields that I can head after this.
              Studio? Macro? Or even a theme like capturing people at work in
              different jobs on the society. Who knows...</p>
              <p>Maybe I have reached the level of reckoning, that competition
              with a fellow photographer is no longer of importance; we all have
              our own styles. I cannot compete with another bus fan's style,
              neither can I compete with other commercial photographers out
              there, <strong>we are simply on different fields rather than
              levels</strong>.</p>
              <p>I welcome anyone to approach me to learn more about the
              different ways that you can shoot a photo. To round up, share
              something that was shot in the past...</p>

              <p>There is a big problem here with most people which most people don understand is that EVERYONE HAVE THEIR DIFF WAY AT LOOKING AT PHOTO </p>
              <p>From my point of view at photo of buses i will say mostly ALL LIKS SHIT<br> <br>there is 1 point i NEVER GET IT a photo of buses MUST BE A FULL BUS IN THE PHOTO AND WITH DESTO VERY CLEAR. And still i WILL ask this very qu. what is the main THINGS you want people to see. YES we all know is buses BUT CAN I ASK DOES THE BUS HAVE DETAIL YES ALOT WHICH PART YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SEE???? as i dare not say my photo are all very good la <br><br>some ans i get is EVERY PART you want people to see </p>
