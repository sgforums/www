              <p>Explain red light cameras. In BOTH directions.</p>
              <p>Happens in Taiwan all the time. The cameras are placed on both sides of the road at the same point and when a photo is taken of a driver on that side, the flash is EXTREMELY glaring for the drivers on the opposite side of the camera.</p>
              <p>You mean Taiwanese drivers are different from Singaporean drivers?</p>

              <p>their driving instructors/friends told them not to.</p>

              <p>No. unfortunately you're changing the topic again.</p>
              <p>Flashing high beams are frequently used by drivers in certain places, that is unless Singaporean drivers are different from drivers in the rest of the world...or maybe from your utterly screwed logic, it is.</p>
              <p>A camera flash is not as strong as a constant high beam or for that matter a flashing high beam. So what does a driver's vision have to do with this? It irritates - yes that's true, but it doesn't affect the vision permanently so much so that he can't drive. Otherwise the high beam would be banned from the roads.</p>

              <p><br>It doesn't even seems like a guideline of not using flash. Even for drivers, people don't even flash high beams at the opposite direction. Simple theory as it affects driver's vision. If a person's mindset was that the bus is not moving so they can flash, where's the logic?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Gosh. You really want to argue your point.</p>
              <p>Alright then. I believe that if the BC is affected by the flash of n4l's camera, he would have used his safety logic and judgement not to drive off for at least half a minute or so after he recovers. As per stated, the bus was in a stationary position, so there is very little hazard. You can say that n4l will cause delays as per my reply, but it is not like as if n4l went around snapping buses pics <em>with</em> flash frequently (i am presuming he really meant that this is his first time for this only).</p>
              <p>Yes, n4l was at fault, but you are now creating a ruckus. I'm also not a very good bus photographer (look at my pics on the first page of this thread) , and your comments do affect everyone in general.</p>
              <p>Ok, simple_boi, that's far enough. You are now insulting other people's pictures and the likes. I'm not going to comment any further unless really required.</p>
