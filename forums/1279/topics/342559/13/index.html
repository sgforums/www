              <p>Just my 2 cents here.</p>
              <p>This entire post is not directed to anyone in particular, but rather, a community as a whole. If you feel offended by the nature of my posting &amp; certain keywords, I sincerely apologise in advance because I have no intention to do so.</p>
              <p>I feel saddened that in a bus community like Singapore, it's <strong>mandatory</strong> to have proper sunlight / absolutely no obstacles in bus photos, failing which the person gets a super harsh lecture and probably gets skinned alive virtually.</p>
              <p>Just look at the Hong Kong bus community. People post photos of a VSO with flower pots blocking the sides of the bus. People post photos of a Trident that has no proper lighting. People post night shots using free hand (and abit grainy). People post photos of bus in wierd angles (some even tilted). People post night shots that have the sides looking super dark.. But do people there lash at those who do not follow so-called <strong>proper protocol</strong> in taking photos?</p>
              <p>Yes having proper lighting conditions makes your photo look nicer. It's an <strong>added bonus</strong>, not a <strong>must-have</strong>. What matters more is that the bus is there; the registration plate is shown, the service number &amp; route details are shown too as well as what's <em>inside</em> the bus. Is it a <strong>crime</strong> to have obstacles in your photo? Is it <strong>illegal</strong> to have the wrong lighting conditions in your photo?</p>
              <p>Alright. People probably say that since they can take photos with super-good quality, so why not the rest. Please. Different people have different styles of photo-taking. So what if your photo looks "nicer" than the rest; please respect another person's photo-taking style. If there is no Sun for 7 days, will you NOT take photos for 7 days? W/O sunlight and you will die because your photos will turn out "horrible"?</p>
              <p>I'm not suggesting that we follow Hong Kong's way of treating fellow bus enthusiasts, but as we are from an Asian culture, <strong>humility</strong> is what makes us stand out from other cultures. Mutual respect is important here. I'm sure if everyone treats another with some basic respect, the entire community can be much more fun-loving and enjoyable. Of which I seriously see no point in having this <em>senior-junior</em> barricade theory, because it's totally rubbish. Does it mean that a senior knows more than a junior? Does it mean that a junior <strong>must</strong> learn everything a senior teaches them?</p>
              <p>I think I've said this before somewhere, but I shall say this again. In chinese there is this saying that goes "ä¸‰äººè¡Œï¼Œå¿…æœ‰æˆ‘å¸ˆç„‰ã€‚åˆ™å…¶å–„è€…è€Œä»Žä¹‹ï¼Œå…¶ä¸�å–„è€…è€Œæ”¹ä¹‹ã€‚"</p>
              <p>For those that don't know what it means, it means that obviously there will be someone here who knows more than others do. However, as someone who knows lesser, one should only <strong>learn</strong> the correct things and <strong>change</strong> the wrong doings (i.e. Remind the person that this is morally wrong / has dire consequences). This is a Confucian principle passed down through many generations; the fact that this principle still stands today shows that it does have a great impact on human beings.</p>
              <p>Of course, sometimes it does take a <strong>reminder</strong> or two to let the person know that he is in the wrong. But not till the extent of a <strong>lecture</strong>. I shall put it this way that the more cocky you are, the more you fail in life. Being humble shall push you to greater heights.</p>
              <p>I shall stop here. I hope my viewpoint will be taken into consideration. Of course, you don't need to <strong>implement</strong> a rule that you must treat others with respect, the fact that we are <strong>humans (or homosapients in leeman terms)</strong> means that we should already treat one another with respect. Sometimes we may get stressed up due to various reasons (pressure or certain personal problems) but it's best not to relieve them off here. Of which I also admit that I've been too rowdy at times before, and I <strong>sincerely apologise</strong> for the emotional distress I may have caused, to anyone affected.</p>
              <p>Yes it's an open forum, we would see people from all walks of life; but one thing in common we have is that we are all humans. And this is a fact.</p>

              <p><br>Your post is very true. I don't think i'd like people to flame about the pictures posted. A reminder is enough, not needing to go overboard with all the ruckus yesterday.i admit my pics posted here are of a very low standard than others here, but i posted them here because it's my hobby and my passion. But the main point to Simple_boi is that each photo that i take, i know there is something unique to the picture..because</p>
              <p>your point of "But too bad, you aren't capable of taking nice photo. Given your photo, it doesn't even worth to develop it out. You don't even know of appreciating photos" is very hurting to me and to everyone in the bus community. I'd be ashamed if i knew you personally.</p>

              <p>I have shot photos for quite a number of years, and perhaps the bus community is a place where I hear the most funny and restricting protocols, really...</p>
              <p>In photography as a general term, <strong>there should not be too many rules to restrict how a photo should be shot</strong>, and there are <strong>no hard and fast rules</strong> either. There may be some tricks like 'rule of thirds' and so on, but they should be only regarded as tricks and not how you should be governed to make your pictures look nice.</p>
              <p>I have tried to share with some folks around me to try these tricks commonly used in commercial photography, but I feel being shunned every time. Bus must be well lighted, bus must be in the center. I even got flamed by god-knows-who about a Scania N113 being posed in the 'rule of thirds' with a battery powered rubbish collector. <strong>What is the constant refusal in accepting new ideas?</strong></p>
              <p>Maybe no one has seen my potential, maybe people do not know me well. I feel sad again and again when these commercial tricks were put to waste just because there was a trend set about how a bus photo should be taken.</p>
              <p>Then again, <strong>I am not the best</strong>. But experience on the field is important. <em>While you guys have shot bus photos on the street for the past number of years, I have shot on community levels all the way to international levels</em>. Its only recently that i have joined the bus theme, and its also recently that i have left it... Retired for good until I can find what i should shoot, <strong>instead of grabbing a thousand-dollar camera just to shoot something on the streets and call myself a 'street-photographer' which any uncle or auntie can do.</strong></p>
              <p>I have ever thought of the fields that I can head after this. Studio? Macro? Or even a theme like capturing people at work in different jobs on the society. Who knows...</p>
              <p>Maybe I have reached the level of reckoning, that competition with a fellow photographer is no longer of importance; we all have our own styles. I cannot compete with another bus fan's style, neither can I compete with other commercial photographers out there, <strong>we are simply on different fields rather than levels</strong>.</p>
              <p>I welcome anyone to approach me to learn more about the different ways that you can shoot a photo. To round up, share something that was shot in the past...</p>

              <p>i don't see why there will be arguments here when there should be posting of photos of buses. there is definitely no need to say things like "useless photos" or comparing each other of their photography skills or photos to see which is better. ok so n4l had posted his first photo, so he should be new to taking photos and not knowing the usual guidelines of posting photos (i don't know also), so i don't understand why Simple_boi have to scold n4l for not listen to advices about not using flash, when he's new to taking photos of buses.</p>
              <p>somemore i don't see how can 2 bus fans keep arguing about photography skills and then to insulting? can't you use PM? Simple_boi is wrong here, i do agree. he was wrong to start judging whether the photo are good or not or said n4l's photo is useless, but n4l is not good either by talking back and talking nonsense. why do both of you have to exchange insults at each other? if you are intending to shame yourselves further by using such words (applies if incident happens in the future), go ahead. since its just 2 people arguing (which brought in TIB537B and dfs24 to argue with Simple_boi also, which i think can be uncalled for), both of you should have used PM to settle both of your issue, and yet both didn't.</p>
              <p>i think it should be high time some bus fans should learn to control their mouth and anger in here before this cause another of such incidents to happen.</p>
              <p>i hope im not tiring out the moderators but if it is possible, please remake a new photo of buses topic and close this existing topic.</p>

It becomes stressful when you die die must take nice photos Being a bus fan i guess it's not about stress , just enjoy yourself and do what you want , other peopl's photo not nice ? don't bother , if you think you're going to post something negative , refrain from posting then , flame wars will occur ...</p></div>
