              <p>Hi, fellow bus enthusiasts.</p>
              <p>I understand that SMRT Buses will be putting on trial a new MIC bus, which is the Zhongtong Bus. This is a hybrid bus, right?</p>
              <p>BusesinSingapore also revealed that there will be another demo for SMRT Buses besides the Zhongtong bus. Any clues as to what brand the fifth demonstrator will be?</p>
              <p>Will it be a MAN, or finally a Scania or surprise, surprise, a Volvo perhaps? Do take note that as according to BusesinSingapore, the bus was residing in Soon Chow. As we all know, Soon Chow has a long partnership with SBS Transit. This is indeed definitely a first if SMRT Buses approached Soon Chow for the bodywork.</p>
              <p>Which goes without saying, the two operators are not just limited to buying a specific model. A good example would be the mass purchase of the Citaros by SBS Transit. Who would have thought that SBS Transit would even consider buying Mercedes Benz buses, let alone the Citaro when it rejected the OC500LE demonstrator even before putting it out on the roads?</p>
              <p>We could possibly see SMRT Buses buying Volvo single decks in the future. Just a theory though. I do have another burning question. I'm sure everybody remembers the King Long hybrid bus which was well publicized when it launched offcially in Singapore. If you caught a glimpse of the interior, the standards are up to SMRT Buses specification.</p>
              <p>Which now brings me to this question: Despite the fact that this is the first hybird bus and being built specifically for SMRT Buses, why did SMRT Buses did not put this bus on trial and instead, the honours went instead to SBS Transit and they did not just launched just one bus, but two hybird buses in partnership with Sunlong and not only that, they launched the fuel cell bus. Which goes without saying: During the press release of the King Long hybrid bus, SBS Transit commented that they're looking into the putting hybrid buses on trial for the future. It certainly didn't take them very long for one year later, they launched Singapore's first hybrid public buses.</p>

              <p>I believe its the other way instead, china bus manufacturers are trying to get SMRT to buy its products, and therefore provide demonstrators for trial. SMRT on the other hand, is not that fond of it (as you can see with the yutong) and returns it after the trial even though it may be up to standard/specification.</p>
              <p>Also, SBS Transit hasent exactly launched the fuel cell bus. Its not even in public service yet.</p>

              <p>I see.... LOL.... I actually thought SMRT wanted to get china buses... Later they get Scania we faint... LOL... Scania Walter Alexander is the best Scania model till date though.... <br><br>I think SBST wants to be green... but found itself in the dilemma of higher costs and also safety issues with fuel cell bus.</p>

              <p>Anyway the trend now seems to be getting demonstration vehicles with hybrid technology, therefore would like to point out a article by tfl (transport for london) regarding performance amongst hybrid buses.</p>

              <p><br>Unless there is a realiable source or pictures, rumours will remain as rumors. Who knows, the bus might just be for another private bus operator or for SBST which is still unknown to us.</p>
              <p>Even SMRT acquired another demo, pictures and realiable news will be up in time. Right now, we just have to foresee that the Zhongtong is the only demo for them. Even if there is another demo, most likely it will be a China made brand using either hybrid or electrical power, since this is the most cost economical way to demo green technologies, just like what SBST did with the hybrid and electrical demo.</p>
              <p>Lastly, it is really a blessing in disguise that SBST decided to buy a big fleet of Citaros, after a disappointment for bus fans who are looking forward to the OC500LE demo to be on the roads last year.</p>

              <p>Maybe SBST had placed the order 2 months back and just officially announced it last month. Anyway, it maybe just 2 shipped over to Singapore to SBST for testing and evaluation, probably by SBST earlier special request from Mercedes Benz, so as to evaluate the 2 units to determine what modifications, if any, to the rest of the 298 units coming in 2 years time.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, you could be right, SBS 1000U. It is possible SBS Transit might have ordered earlier and requested for 2 units first to determine what type of modifications need to be made. Same thing for SMB 136C. Which is why SMRT Buses put the Citaro on 1 year trial first before placing further orders for it. The Mercedes Benz Citaro definitely needs modification to suit the needs of Singapore's climate and road conditions. It comes completely built up. However, i project that SBS Transit's Citaro interior will bear the uniqueness of SBS Transit's current standard. For example, it could possibly have purple coloured grab poles, orange coloured PVC leather seats, EDS by Hanover. That's just speculation, though.</p></div>

              <p><br>I presume that the following changes could be requested by SBST for its Citaro fleet:</p>
              <p>- purple grabpoles</p>
              <p>- volgelstiz orange fabric seats, else orange stock Mercedes Benz seats (Please no cloth fabrics)</p>
              <p>- Air con ducts</p>
              <p>- Bus stopping sign and chime</p>
              <p>- Speed limiter, EZ link card readers, GPS and other operational gadgets for Singapore buses</p>
              <p>- Side EDS as standard displaying route number and details, front EDS may be stock or using Hanover</p>
              <p>- Aloca rims with rim guards as seen in the Fuel Cell Citaro but can also be unlikely</p>
              <p>But I hope there will be no changes to the exterior body design, so keep the stock body design.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I totally agree with you. Except for the part on ez-link card readers. SBS Transit can install that themselves. The OC500LE didn't come installed with EZ-link card readers, now did they? SBS Transit's side EDS for the Citaros will definitely display the route and service no, as per current standard with their new buses with EDS. Definitely no changes to the exterior as i believe it's standard as per the Citaro assembly line.</p></div>

              <p>We already have a Volvo B7RLE on trial for now, but I hope SBST can bring in the fully low floor B9L for one demo to bring in other fully low floor types other than the Citaros.</p>
              <p>As for Enviro 200, I don't think local operators will buy any more midi buses due to economical operative costs, especially load demand for buses are increasing. But I do hope that SBST can replace the Darts with the Enviro 200. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
