It probably started life with Green Bus Company (GBC - no pun intended with the shorthand form of GameBoy Colour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) as GBC route 4, from Ban San Street (possibly somewhere near where Queen Street is today) to the junction of Mandai Road and Sembawang Road, according to the bus guides of 1966  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  . In 1972 and 1973, it was a United Bus Company (UBC) route, and at that time it already has gained the number it never shook off since - 171. Bus guides from 1972 and 1973 indicates that it was already operating out of Queen Street by that time, but has an otherwise generally similar route to GBC's route 4 (still terminating (or was it looping?) at the Sembawang Road end of Mandai Road. By 1979/1980, it finally came out onto Sembawang Road and terminated near Nee Soon Camp (not too far from it's original terminus, actually) it had also started to deviate into the zoo via Mandai Lake Road at this point (this was where the photo of the NAC MB O405 on route 171 on businfohub.com was taken). However, it was still operating out of Queen Street at this point in time, and (according to SgWiki) it was not until 1993 that it changed course and went to Orchard Road and terminated at Marina Centre (along with an extension into Bukit Panjang - how did it enter Bukit Panjang before it was amended to BKE in 1999 by the way?). By then, it was already going into Yishun, and according to SgWiki, it was a Sembawang Air Base - Queen Street route at some point before the Yishun extension in the 1980's. The introduction of route 138 in 1994 made it skip the narrow stretch of Mandai Road and the zoo completely. Coincidentally, it was the amendment of another bus route that went to the zoo when it was with TIBS - route 927 - that further changed it's route in 1999 - this time to ply BKE between Bukit Panjang and Mandai Road.<br><br>I believe this makes route 171 the oldest route within SMRT's control in terms of it's history (the oldest route that has always been under SMRT (ex-TIBS) that never changed it's number is route 167, and route 167 and 980 shares this if you disregard numbers).</div>
