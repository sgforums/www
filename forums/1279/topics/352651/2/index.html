              <p><br>let me help you with a bit of planning. Sometimes I find the sbs website gives weird solutions.</p>
              <p>If you do not mind waking up early in the morning you may take service 24 from the basement terminus to Ang Mo Kio Interchange, thereafter transferring 138 to the zoo. If you are rushing for time, take the train directly to Ang Mo Kio instead thereafter cross the underpass to the Interchange for 138.</p>
              <p>Here are the timings for 138 from Ang Mo Kio Interchange on<br>Weekdays: 0739 0758 0813 0829 0844 0900 0920 0939 0959 1018 1038 1057<br>Saturdays: 0739 0750 0801 0813 0824 0835 0847 0903 0919 0935 0951 1006 1021 1037 1052<br>Sundays: 0732 0743 0755 0806 0818 0829 0841 0852 0904 0915 0926 0938 0953 1008 1023 1037 1050</p>
              <p>You may take 138 back to Ang Mo Kio Interchange and have lunch at the AMK Hub or any coffee shops nearby. From here i recommend 3 routes to the airport.<br>1. Service 166 to Clementi, then train to Airport. Bus ride approx 1h45min, train about 55min cos of the waiting time at Tanah Merah. You may wish to change to the train at HarBourfront, City Hall or Little India train stations if time is of an important factor</p>
              <p>2. Service 25 to Bedok Interchange. Change to the train thereafter or 24 from Bedok station bus stop.</p>
              <p>3. 88 from the bus stop outside Ang Mo Kio MRT to Pasir Ris. From there I would advice you to take the train. Otherwise, transfer to 53 at the first bus stop after the express sector.</p>
              <p>you may consider other solutions but these are some ideas for you. :)</p>

You may go back to the airport using the non-doubledecker bus routes, 138 to Ang Mo Kio Interchange, and change to service 24***, and it will surely bring you to the airports.</p>

              <p>Sorry folks. Been catching up on work.</p>
              <p>Someone asked if this was the plan:</p>
              <p>airport &gt; zoo &gt; battle box @ fort canning &gt; airport</p>
              <p>Yes. Mostly.</p>
              <p>Might meet some old friends for lunch - if I can get in touch with them and we all agree on where to eat. Some are vegetarians (no meat, no fish, no seafood).</p>
              <p>My Nephew flying in with me might get hit by jet lag. So, I might have to scale back some of this traveling around, to give him time to get some sleep back in the airport.</p>
              <p>Will arrive on a Sunday early morning (2am) and depart same night at about 9 pm. This kind of kills an idea of a night safari (in my recollection it was a 7.30 pm - 10.30 pm thing).</p>
              <p>Yes, I remember where Tampines is - didn't know there was an IKEA there (leave alone the fact that SIN now has two IKEAs). Not too keen on visiting an IKEA, seen many of them in many countries and they are mostly the same.</p>

              <p>Maybe to you for IKEA in Tampines it might be some alien to you, but to me, it's already too boring..... Hahas. How sad that you are arriving in the late night at 2am,</p>
              <p>Just adding to my post:</p>
              <p>You might want to go to The National Muesum of Singapore since your nephew loves History. The ticket prices are rather cheap, as I have went there before. A lot of things to see. I am sure your nephew loves it. The muesum is just next to SMU?</p>

              <p>since u are arriving at 2am and buses dont run at such an unearthly hour, take the time to recover from jet lag. probably at around 7 or 8, make your way to the zoo via SBS8033D's suggested route, 27 168 926 since its a sunday. to get to fort canning you can take 927 to choa chu kang and then 190, bendies are available on this service and there is a long express sector available. From fort canning to the airport there's bus 36.</p>

              <p>Since this is the case, here's what i would propose for you</p>
              <p>I hope your nephew would recover from jet lag by the time he wakes up at 9am at the airport hotel. Thereafter, take a train to Tampines, or service 27 from the airport terminus to Tampines train station, transfer to 168 to Woodlands Interchange. 168 has the longest express sector of any basic bus service in Singapore. I believe your nephew would love it.</p>
              <p>At Woodlands Interchange, board 926 to the zoo. After your zoo trip, take 138 to Ang Mo Kio Interchange transfer the train to Clarke Quay via Dhoby Ghaut. From here, look for the MICA Building exit from the station and then walk up Fort Canning from River Valley Rd which is next to the building.</p>
              <p>With regards to lunch, you may eat at either of the 3 places<br>1. Zoo<br>2, AMK Hub which is located at Ang Mo Kio Interchange<br>3. Central (shopping ctr) @Clarke Quay. Its above the train station of the same name.</p>
              <p>After the Battle Box, you may wish to hike your way down to Central @ Clarke<a href="mailto:Central@Clarke"> </a>Quay bus stop for Service 2 12 or 51. That is if you still have time for another double deck ride. Otherwise, take the train to the airport from City Hall which is within walking distance from Battle Box.</p>
              <p>For Service 2 or 12, you may alight at Tanah Merah train station bus stop for a transfer to Service 24 to the airport. For 51, the transfer is at Eunos train station bus stop.</p>
