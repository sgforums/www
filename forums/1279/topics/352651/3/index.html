              <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">If you haven't got an EZ-Link card, get a one-day <a href="http://www.thesingaporetouristpass.com/html/">Singapore Tourist Pass</a>. Unlimited rides, and no hassle in searching the pocket for change at every bus, or wasting time collecting deposit at the GTM. </span><em>Scratch that. Card not sold until 12 noon at Airport.</em></p>
              <p>Suggest train ride to Woodlands, change to 926 to Zoo.</p>
              <p>Then return to Ang Mo Kio interchange on 138. Transfer to 166 that travels to the city. 166 offers a very good chance of a double-decker, and if you're lucky a unique demonstrator onboard.</p>
              <p>You can (1) alight at Little India to have a vegetarian meal (spicy! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="" width="20" height="20"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="" width="20" height="20">) before hopping on another 166, or (2) head straight for Battle Box (bus stop outside National Museum) if you've chosen to eat at Ang Mo Kio already.</p>
              <p>Hop onto Bus 36 (if you have spare time, that same bus stop for a sightseeing trip through Orchard) or from Dohby Gahut Station (if you're short of time) straight back to Airport. Train ride to Airport is also available.</p>

              <p>DTE stands for Downtown East. There is a theme park with amusement rides there but I would say it is pretty miserable.<br><br>I believe you should stick to your plan as time is a constraint seeing ur coming in at 2am, taking a rest, heading out &amp; you are required to be back at the airport at 4pm.<br><br>as such, u may want to stick to service 238's suggestions.</p>

              <p>Nephew and I are flying into Changi. We plan to stay at the
                          Transit hotel in the airport. We'll likely get some rest and then
                          try to get to the breakfast with the orangutans in the zoo. I would
                          like to follow that up with a bus ride, some lunch and back to the
                          airport by around 4 pm local time. That gives him some time to get
                          a nap or rest before we board our plane to fly out. </p>
              <p>Other choice is to visit the Battle Box since he is interested
                          in history. Maybe fit a bus ride into that.</p>
              <p>I'll try and do some planning using the sbs website. Thanks for

              <p>In that case, I suggest after u visit the zoo. Take sv 138 to Ang Mo Kio and have your lunch and hop on sv 166 from Ang Mo Kio to Battle Box where that service has a quite a number of double-decker which your nephew wants to have a try. There is about 80% chance that you will get a double-decker on that service. If you managed to got on a bus which has a electronic destination sign which looks totally different from other double decker bus of its bodywork, I congratulate you from my bottom of my heart. From the Battle Box at Fort Canning, there is a direct bus there at Fort Canning where you can hop on sv 36 to head back to the airport. Hope that you will enjoy your stay here in singapore.</p>
