Anyway, many people are taking MRT nowadays instead of trunk service buses to their destinations since they are faster.<br><br>So, I infer that with Circle Line coming up, they are trying to make journeys especially at SMRT areas like this.<br>Feeder/Trunk to MRT, MRT to another MRT station. Feeder/Trunk from MRT station to another destination.<br><br>As a result, multiple transfers are required.<br><br>What I can recommend is that perhaps they can increase the transfer rebate to reduce the prices caused by transferring and make this type of journeys a more attractive one.  </div></blockquote>Not only about the money...waiting times for transferring is quite an important soon.

Then, next, like I've explained in the trains forums, the cause of you seeing a 8 or 9 minutes displayed as "Next train" on the plasma screen TV is due to firstly, passengers taking their own sweet time, therefore messing up the accuracy of the schedule. Next, the next train info works on a system that is highly sensitive and sometimes it may go wrong.<br><br>I'm quite sure people here (not only here) are trying to shoot at SMRT every way they can simply because SBST bought new buses, "Oh they bought new buses, SMRT didn't, so SMRT sucks." "Oh SMRT said they were going to buy some in the future, <strong>That is not going to be happening at near future.*</strong>" What gibberish. Since SMRT has said it do you think they would be that stupid to go back on their word?<br><br>*Contributed by sBs_boy<br><br>I suggest that before people start shooting at the MRT system about train frequencies, they had better go ask themselves, how long did they wait for a next bus (on average) assuming they reached the bus stop and the bus just left, and how long they waited for the next train, based on the same scenario. If they can provide me with the correct details I bow my heads to them, because they know the facts; if they try to make up some stupid story that is highly unbelievable, just to try to poke me, I can only say they are pure losers. I've been to many bus stops, and I read the next bus average waiting times, so don't think people here can fool me that the average waiting time for a bus is longer than a train. Oh and, don't come here and say that they are 2 different things; I'm merely comparing which transport vehicle waits longer for a next one in general. Because I'm very frustrated that people can complain about a 7-minute wait when they actually waited 9 to 11 minutes on average for a bus. Worse still, people can spend so much time spotting buses, noting down cameos, yet they complain over a 7-minute disorder.<br><br>I'm OK if you shoot at SMRTB; they didn't do well. If you try to shoot at SMRT trains without even having basic knowledge of the train systems, how it works, why there are delays (both technical and natural errors), which I myself clearly know because I have been a train fan for years, I suggest that you bring it on to me.</div>

Mostly trains that display 8 or 9 minutes arrive within 7 minutes and 30 seconds, and I've said before, due to the system error of the sensor.

I have to say SMRT train freq is better than SBST even though SBST one is more regulated. This I infer is probably due to the fact that SBST trains are computer controlled which can control its freq perfectly.<br>Compare the freq with any of the bus service especially during peak hrs. SMRT train freq has to be higher than SBST since it serves more densely populated towns like Bedok, Tampines, Boon Lay and many more.<br><br>Look at how many people are taking the MRT nowadays.<br>According to the poll that I have done earlier, about 50% of the people will prefer to take the bus then MRT route as this way is faster. With more traffic lights and higher vehicle population, taking MRT is a good way to save time. Besides, it is not easy to get from one place to another via bus as you will need to know which bus services I will have to take to get there. MRT has fewer landmarks and hence easier for us to memorise stations closest to our destinations.<br><br>Each has its pros and cons.<br><br>I guess there is train bunching too. However, it will be less significient as compared to buses.<br><br>9 mins wait is actually ok just that it becomes frustrating to see very high passenger loads in the trains. Then, everyone will try to push and rush into the limited spaces available in the trains. Plus the problem of people blocking the entrance also adds to the frustration.<br>Hence, I seldom take trains.<br><br></div>
