            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, i stumbled upon this article today morning on the Straits Times forum and can't help but to agree with it. It talks about how SMRT is not doing well in the area of provision of bus services, and also how its fare hikes is not justified. Well, thought i just post it here to get the opinion of the bus community and also maybe some of you can do something about it?<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">SMRT found lacking when it comes to public bus improvements</span></strong><br><br>THE articles on bus services (ST, Nov 1) reflect the recent improvements made. But it has come to my attention though that the benefits shown do not benefit the entire population.<br><br>1. I refer to the article, 'Elderly-friendly buses hit the road'. It must be noted that the buses are operated by SBS Transit, which does not operate services in the Northwest Corridor towns of Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang. These towns are operated by SMRT which has not announced any plans to introduce new buses. In fact, SMRT operates a whole fleet of elderly- and handicapped-unfriendly buses. Some of these are old, like the Nissan buses frequently on Service 975, and others are in very bad condition, like the Scania buses on Service 187. These buses have high steps and are not very environmentally friendly (compare these buses to SBS's 500 new buses). It is sad to see disabled commuters unable to board and the elderly struggling to board. It raises the question: When will SMRT buy new buses to add to the existing fleet? How long will it take for the old buses to be replaced?<br><br>2. I now refer to the article, 'Bus routes up 22% from 5 years ago'. Again, it should be noted that the bus routes' increased coverage is due mainly to SBS' good work, not SMRT Buses'. Over the course of the last five years, SMRT has made a few enhancements to some of its services such as the introduction of Service 950 to Johor, extension of service 975 to Bukit Panjang and amendments to Service 985. Conversely, compared to its counterpart, SMRT is not doing enough. SMRT Buses diverts its resources to the Premium and Shuttle bus services but what about the basic services used by the majority? In the last five years, no new services, except the minor enhancements, have been initiated in the Northwest Corridor Towns. The connectivity of these towns to the Eastern region of Singapore is very limited. When given feedback, SMRT tells its commuters to use the trains services. If SBS, which operates trains too, is able to introduce many new bus services, why not SMRT?<br><br>Minister Raymond Lim had said that the fare increases are necessary as the bus operators need the income to purchase new buses while introducing new services. This reason is more justified for bus operator SBS. As a daily customer of SMRT, I appeal to SMRT to provide better connectivity, buses and services to its customers just as SBS Transit commendably is doing.<br><br>-name deleted-<br><br>SOURCE: http://www.straitstimes.com/ST%2BForum/ST%2BForum.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mmm... I have to strongly agree with this. It seems that after SMRT took over TIBS there has been little or no improvement with the buses but some major improvements with trains.<br><br>Who agrees that TIBS would have been better off by it's own?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But got to confess that SBS have OLDER buses than the Nissans, especially the MK-IIIs, which looked newer but are actually older than the UDs.
