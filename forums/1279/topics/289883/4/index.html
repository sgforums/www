DBG had a small fire over at the station and thus causing part of the NSL to be shut down. What did SMRT do ? Instead of providing shuttle buses to the affected passengers, Staffs were found to be asking people to refund and find their own means of transport home. Is this the way to handle the situation ??<br><br>When NEL had problems with Outram stn, Shuttle buses were activated within 30mins to provide shuttle service to affected passengers.<br><br>NEL may be small..<br>But the service standards that you see is totally different.<br>Or rather, i should say..<br>Its Worlds apart.  </div></blockquote>my wife work in Newton area and on that day , she went to Newton MRT at around 7.05pm and were told that the MRT were down.

If there's anyone who enjoys showing off or attracting attention, it should be you.<br><br>What simnatic, the thread starter had done was to post an article about SMRT he came across in the media, which was written by some member of the public.<br><br>Tell me, what is sbst275 guilty this time?  Nothing.

If you are articulate enough, why don't you write a letter to the mass media and tell them to stop printing comments about SMRT, or better still write a letter to defend SMRT.  (I pose this challenge to muziq_bus as well).<br><br>And if you suffered any grievances that day on Service 24, SBS 0180P, I think the better channel would be to write a lodge a complaint with SBST via the internet or the telephone.  If you had the time to type the whole incident out then copy and paste them on three forums, I am sure that time will be more well spent on informing the company directly what had happened so as to take remedial action.  So do not say you are not free.  Because you clearly had nothing better to do.  Wouldn't this benefit other commuters then more than ranting and raving about the same incident on three forums?

I can't believe SMRT is brazenly deluding readers in thinking that they have been making a conscientious effort to improve their service standards while they havent been doing much.<br><br>Firstly, they go and talk about the bendy buses. Nice. SMRT wasnt even in charge of the bus operations during 1996, and they dare say that they "introduced bendy buses yada yada yada". Secondly, in view of their infinitesimal improvement to bus services, they have to dig out something as ancient as 1996.<br><br>Next, they went to harp on their new services. This further proves SMRT have hardly anything to talk in terms of improvement so they had to literally list down their measly new services (even dated back to 2001!).<br><br>Cut the tall story that they want to provide seamless journeys to enhance commuters' convenience.

In a month. I think even SBST can't be on par with it, considering over 2 million bus riderships and less than 400k train riderships.<br><br>Well, SMRT has done magnificently well for the Trains part, maybe because they specialise in trains. Now for buses. If they could introduce more new buses to complement with frequencies of 4 ~ 5 minutes per bus (basically, doubling the fleet) which I think it quite possible since they get so much profits per year from (40 million riderships in a month). Minus off train operating costs and the refurbishment of trains I think the amount left is quite substantial to supplement the Buses with new bus fleets. Double the SMRT fleet is around 750 ~ 800 buses which is just a little more than what SBST has ordered, 500 Scanias. If they can do that, cutting the waiting time by half, I'm sure more people would be pleased. But then again, fuel prices are at a crazy stage now; I think SBST even suffers from it. By limiting passenger transport to trains, they are actually saving fuel because trains operate on electricity and not on fuel. They save cost and save the environment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If SBST can chug up such a huge sum of money to buy new buses even with monthly riderships less than 13 times that of SMRT, why can't SMRT? I'm happy to welcome the doubling of bus fleets as it would make passenger satisfaction higher.<br><br>EDIT: Heres the link: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=291715" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=291715</a></div>
