Speaks volumes.<br><br>So the same advice you gave to sbst275 applies to you.  Move on!  Either avoid service 24, sbst services totally, or a public transport to move about, or write a letter of complaint to SBST if you want to redress your grievances over the incident.<br><br>And it's true that the service standards of SMRT buses pales in comparison to SBST Transit.  No IRIS, visibly enhanced links, or new initiatives to reach out to the disabled.  At least what SMRT buses IMHO is purely cosmetic, hardly a one grand piece of theatrics.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I also think that SMRT is lagging way back compared to SBST's standard nowdays...<br><br>Firstly, SBST had put in a lot of effort to buy in more new buses, eg VSO, Volvo CNGs, Volvo B9TLs and the most recent Scania K230UBs. Whereas SMRT only increased its bus fleets by reusing all the old Nissan UD buses formally from CSS. The newest bus so far is still the Habits which was last bought in 2002.<br><br>Secondly, I also noticed that SBST had introduced a lot of new bus routes so as to make travel more accessible from places to places. Whereas SMRT had not been looking into improving its bus routes especially Sembawang estate.</div>

Yet it attempts to get involved in other fringe activities, such as a partnership with Citibank in the name of commuter "rewards" and improving ridership. These kind of activities ought to be stopped and rechanneled into real service standards improvement.<br><br>On another note, the recent PM Lee's discovery of crowded trains is disappointing. Our Prime Minister does not know the grounds of normal Singaporeans at all.</div>

With the upcoming circle line having only 3 cars per train, it would be a bad thing to have the 8 min frequency during off peak.</div>

We could not deny the fact that the frequceny for NEL is way better than SMRT side. There is no way that you would see  8 - 12mins for a train during off peak period. Or even uneven frequency during different days.<br><br>Have you read the papers recently ? You have any idea how many letters was being aimed at SMRT recently due to their "Technical" fault ? Causing thousands of passengers to be stuck at various stations ?? DBG had a small fire over at the station and thus causing part of the NSL to be shut down. What did SMRT do ? Instead of providing shuttle buses to the affected passengers, Staffs were found to be asking people to refund and find their own means of transport home. Is this the way to handle the situation ??<br><br>When NEL had problems with Outram stn, Shuttle buses were activated within 30mins to provide shuttle service to affected passengers.<br><br>NEL may be small..<br>But the service standards that you see is totally different.<br>Or rather, i should say..<br>Its Worlds apart.</div>

Why do you want to be so autocratic and ask him to "shut the hell up"? If you are so free to type out the story + duplicate twice, i dont see why u are not free to complain.  If some people think SMRT sucks, what right do u have from stopping them to voice out their opinions here?</div>
