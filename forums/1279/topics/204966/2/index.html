            <div class='col-md body'>hahahaha. you want harry potter bus issit? midnight express for stranded Singaporeans. lol<br><br>Where got DD flip at low speed one? The one i know that flipped in HK is speeding and carrying full load. Remember SG and HK bus seat configuration is different. HK one can carry more ppl. And it flipped waalauweh, damn scary sia. I also kena that fobia b4 but everytime you take a DD think, where can flip one? SG and HK DD got different pax wad. so should be safe and summore SG road so small and got lots of turns and there's no previous bus flipping incident in SG b4. Coach dd cannot flip unless the driver sleepy and decides to park at the roadside ditch or in someones vehicle.<br><br>Sbst artic (B10m) the engine is mid mounted(mid mounted is volvo's trademark for the b10m and b12m series). The Video that the bus is so called 'drifting' by some of the users at youtube (actually not counted drifting because he lost control of his bus <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) the engine is midmounted cos if rear mounted won't happen like that one and it will be even worse, the second half of the bus start to skid<br><br>Rear mounted or mid mounted bendies, mid mounted bendies are more stable than rear mounted because rear mounted usually the back part of the bus so bouncy and ppl cannot sleep (including me). For me, i'd prefer DD than Artics or bendies because DD can sleep Artic/bendies cannot sleep. DD got no standing rule so if bus full and i get a seat at the upper deck no need to sit beside a person standing beside me and raise his arms to hould hand rail and you know what you can smell.<br><br></div>

Its the suspension that broke &amp; not the axle. Saw a NAC Mk2 WA last year in Boon Lay Int on sv182 that broke both the front right &amp; rear right suspension (don't know how to BC drive also). It was later driven slowly back to SLBP after the BC reported to the TK. The first step was at waist level <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
