DD more dangerous? Have you heard of the term 'jack-knife'? If you ask me, both are very dangerous especially when it is coming straight at you! And did you know that the B10M and the B10MA had the same engine? The O405 and O405G basically have the same engine as well. Same goes for the L94UB and L94UA. So how come you say artic have bigger engines than normal buses? Bigger in terms of what? If in terms of money then I would agree. And even if they have a larger engine, the engine power is used to move more weight so how come it can accelerate faster? And since when does a higher acceleration equals a higher speed? Higer acceleration simply means you will reach the top speed in less time.<br><br>SMRT didn't buy DD because they don't have the facilities for DDs. If they buy DDs, they would have to build a new depot for storage, service and maintenance. All this cost lot of money. Next time, please think rationally.</div>

O405G, VOs, LOs, VSOs, B10MA all haf turbocharged engines.... this is needed to move the additional weight... n modern buses haf good suspension systems to cope wif all these xtra loads... so chances of jack-knife or flipping is very remote... n im sure all the buses suppliers haf put their buses thru rigorous tests b4 putting them on the roads... so i guess ur worries r quite unfounded...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Sorry, completely off topic. I have no interest in bus but this quote opens my eye.<br><br>Quote : Take the Boeing 757 airliner for example (its ok if you do not know, this is a bus forum). The airliner is designed as domestic transport, and hence when it climbs or decends, it take a much steeper slope. It needs to reach the cruising height quickly. The power-to-weight ratio is also much larger than other airliners. In the 1980s, there were several fatal accidents involving other smaller aircraft, when they went into a 757's wake turbulence.<br><br>Boeing 757 is not designed only for domestic flights but for intercontinental routes as well. Basically its a narrowbody , larger capacity then the B737 and A320 family. Boeing 757 has 2 types . -200 and -300. Boeing 757-300 is the domestic transport. Boeing 757-200 do flies on longer sectors like the trans-alantic (Continental with winglets) and regional routes (Asia) (China Southern , Air China ..etc ).<br><br>Anyway enough about the introduction. There are some points you are wrong. I am working in an airline industry, let me explain to you.<br><br>Boeing 757 is powered by either RR or PW engines. I can say so far Boeing 757 is the most powerful aircraft in it's class. The reason why you see B757 climbing steeply is not because it has to reach the attitude fast, The common reason is that the load is pretty light therefore the powerful steep climb.<br><br>In the 1980s, there were several fatal accidents involving other smaller aircraft, when they went into a 757's wake turbulence.  &lt;--- That is why now the ATC organisation has declared 757 a heavy along wth the widebodies.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Any questions , feel free to ask.</div>

In rainy days more than once I saw the second axle locking as it runs over the yellow box at bus stops and the driver tries to stop in time. Except for a jerk which is normal I did not hear any locking sound, so I am not sure.</div>
