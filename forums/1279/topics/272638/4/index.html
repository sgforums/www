I know you hate him/her, but please keep it to yourself and not to post online and let everyone know.<br><br>Next, all BCs are required to check student's ez-link card when he/she pays concession fare. This is to ensure fairness to other passengers. BCs have to know whether you are still a student and whether you can pay concession fare. This is all BCs job. I personally do meet some bad attitude BC but think, they are earning a living. Do you know how students treat BC when they are asked to check their ez-link cards? They give lousy attitude also. According to BCs I know, even though you wear school uniform you still cannot pay concession fares. The transitlink website states "For travelling on bus, children above 0.9m and below 1.2m in height are eligible for travel concession without a concession card. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children who are 1.2m and above in height will need a Child ez-link card or a valid concession card to be eligible for travel concession.</span>" I think as a bus fan, you should think deeper as a BC. Imagine if you see so many lousy attitude students everyday, what happen to your impression towards these students?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I think they are more strict on those who pay cash. For those who uses ezlink, there isn't much trouble. For me, i uses ezlink for all my bus rides and i did not have these encounters before. I have only encounter 2 BCs(AMDEP 21 and HGDEP 101) which  request to see my card. I let them see and they nod their head and nothing happen.</div>
