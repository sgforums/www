            <div class='col-md body'>I find Johor public buses are more transparent on this issue.<br><br>I can find the chart (white wordings with black background) on the exterior side of each bus stating the carrying capacity. for eg: 40 PENUMPANG, 26 BENDIRI.<br><br>Wheras for our local public buses, the exterior sides do not carry such notices (except cross-border buses). Worse still, the Licensed to Carry Charts are extremely small and difficult to read and is displayed at the remote top corner of the driver's cabin. And the chart is not updated even after some alterations to the seating arrangement. The licenced standing capacity is sometimes not consistent with similar makes and even ridiculous. for eg the already retired NAC double-deckers - Standing Capacity of abt 6 to 12? Is that the case?<br>oh ya - and the old NAC CSS buses: the licenced standing capacity is 0 pax!!!<br><br>Last time, at least the stickers or charts are displayed more prominently onboard the buses but no longer nowadays.</div>

I'm sure these pax would rather squeeze than be late. sometimes esp the morning peak - suay suay a bus breakdown or there's a sudden surge in demand at a certain time, it can't be helped.<br><br>The most challenging part of bus operators are to handle the highest amt of pax during the morning peak esp.<br>for eg many people start work at 8.30 or 9.00am. Thats the time when the most number of people try to squeeze onto these buses that reach their workplace closest to their start work time. They would not want to catch the earlier buses as they don't want to report for work too early too.<br><br>Boosting the number of buses maybe up to a certain limit only as its not econimically feasible. we cant expect our bus operators to buy more than enough buses to operate only during the couple hrs of  morning peak then park inside the depot during the remaining times. even if so, are we prepared to fork out higher fares to sustain the bus companies on the whole?</div>
