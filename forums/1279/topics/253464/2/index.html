            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think SBST can also do a good job. I personally agree that SBST are good in handling deployment of buses during the peak hours. Sadly, they have problem during the off peak hours. Just like svc 242, after 7.40pm, u can see the crowd appears but they only deploy those single decker bus. That cause pple to stand on the stairs and even some unable to board the bus. (BTW, the most passengers moved to the rear.) Express 502 too, u see how sucks are their deployment of buses during the weekends. Heavy loading appears and people standing at the stairs and need to bear this for more than 20mins to reach the next stop.</div>
