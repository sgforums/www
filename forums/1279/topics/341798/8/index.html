              <p>Actually, what's so bad about bendy? In fact the video shown (link given earlier) happens that the tunnel road is frozen with ice. Thats why the bendy skidded like that. Even so, many years back, the newspaper have already proven that bendies in singapore is very safe. It is due to the safety mechanism in the bendy joints. Unless that mechanism is faulty, our bendy should never drift like a truck trailer. Just like our lifts. All of them are built in such a way that should the lift cables snap, a lock will quickly come into action, preventing the people from plunging to their deaths. Its a fail-safe mechanism. But even a fail safe mechanism would require maintenance. If maintenance isnt there, then..</p>
              <p>A good thing i like about bendy is quick transfer time for passengers. Often i noticed that it takes 3 mins for the DD of svc 30 to unload and load passengers. Thats because the people below have to wait for the people upstairs to exit first before they can move up. However, in the bendy situation, people can alight and board and take up seats simultaneously. Theres 2 more exit doors as well, leading to even quicker passenger disembarkment.</p>

              <p>I think Bendies are perfectly safe on spore roads, provided SMRT ensures the cruise control mechanism is kept in good working condition hence preventing the SL from speeding. Also, SMRT should deploy only the more disciplined and responsible SL on Bendies and educate them to turn slowly and drive slower during rainy days or when road conditions are slippery and dangerous.</p>
              <p>And I think the LTA should not totally ban the existence of Bendies on spore roads. Look at how well served the bendies are at Yishun and WDL neighbouring estates! Perhaps, the LTA should excercise some constraints on Bendies being deployed to busy city centres such as svc 67,106,190,700,851,960. These extra-long buses are adding up to the long bus queues at the city centres. Two double-deckers can stop within the bus-stop to board and alight pax at one time but only one bendy can do so at a bus-stop due to its length. How about LTA introduce some incentives to operators on deployment of double-deckers?</p>

              I don't think so. I remembered an article in the ST recently that our bus operators appealed to LTA for exemption of ERP charges. LTA rejected their request citing public buses also added to traffic congestion hence got to pay ERP charges; but at a lower rate. 
              I agree with the bus operators that its unfair for them to foot ERP charges, since public buses help to reduce traffic congestion. But since our leaders think otherwise, LPPL lo!

                              <p>Actually, what's so bad about bendy? In fact the video shown
              (link given earlier) happens that the tunnel road is frozen with
              ice. Thats why the bendy skidded like that. Even so, many years
              back, the newspaper have already proven that bendies in singapore
              is very safe. It is due to the safety mechanism in the bendy
              joints. Unless that mechanism is faulty, our bendy should never
              drift like a truck trailer. Just like our lifts. All of them are
              built in such a way that should the lift cables snap, a lock will
              quickly come into action, preventing the people from plunging to
              their deaths. Its a fail-safe mechanism. But even a fail safe
              mechanism would require maintenance. If maintenance isnt there,
              then..</p>
              <p>A good thing i like about bendy is quick transfer time for
              passengers. Often i noticed that it takes 3 mins for the DD of svc
              30 to unload and load passengers. Thats because the people below
              have to wait for the people upstairs to exit first before they can
              move up. However, in the bendy situation, people can alight and
              board and take up seats simultaneously. Theres 2 more exit doors as
              well, leading to even quicker passenger disembarkment.</p>

              I believe Bendies were already existent in the world for several decades. If they were dangerous, they would have become extinct long ago. How come countries such as Australia and China continue using them? I believe with proper control, safety can be kept with control (pls refer to my earlier post).
              
              But disadvantages of bendies on spore roads are it needs more space to monouvre within bus depots and interchanges and require more space for parking. I believe having a mixture of bendies and double-deckers would be ideal as they can work together complementing each other to achieve a good public transport system. Double-deckers having more seats would be a more positive way to encourage people to switch to public transport. Who likes standing?

              <p><strong>I think Bendies are perfectly safe on spore roads, provided SMRT
              ensures the cruise control mechanism is kept in good working
              condition hence preventing the SL from speeding. Also, SMRT should
              deploy only the more disciplined and responsible SL on Bendies and
              educate them to turn slowly and drive slower during rainy days or
              when road conditions are slippery and dangerous.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And I think the LTA should not totally ban the existence of
              Bendies on spore roads. Look at how well served the bendies are at
              Yishun and WDL neighbouring estates! </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Perhaps, the LTA should
              excercise some constraints on Bendies being deployed to busy city
              centres such as svc 67</span><strong>, 106,190,700,851,960.</strong> These extra-long buses
              are adding up to the long bus queues at the city centres. Two
              double-deckers can stop within the bus-stop to board and alight pax
              at one time but only one bendy can do so at a bus-stop due to its
              length. How about LTA introduce some incentives to operators on
              deployment of double-deckers?</p>
