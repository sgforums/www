Anyway, it isn't too nice to stoop to personal levels and attack the less informed. People who do that in ALL forums (notably special interest ones like Cars, Buses etc) need to be thwapped and mods need to be alert. Perhaps Jason could consider appointing FS to help out Nick34 at the Cars forum.</div>
