            <div class='col-md body'>Look, it isn't often I agree with a kid, but I actually think he is correct.  After the transfer of 7, 66 and 32, all of which are high frequency routes, HGDEP (who's confirmed spare vehicles in peak hour was actually 45 pre-transfer) would have actually been significantly reduced.  Whether the depot wishes to gamble on the mechanical soundness of its fleet and choose to operate another service is up to them, but I would be reluctant to believe that this was the case.  And Upp East Coast Terminal is closer to BNDEP, so if it was to run, why wouldn't BNDEP be running it?  Unless they shared it?  Considering also that there is no press release, I will not believe it until I see it.  Especially with BNDEP not having the most well presented fleet on the island, and HGDEP not too far behind, it would seem hard to believe.  Or, there are some twisted people out there, maybe they have a vendetta against all enthusiasts and are just getting us to chase our own tails?</div>
