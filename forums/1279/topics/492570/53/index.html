              <p>ICIC! This is actually pretty messy though, but I got what u meant already.</p>
              <p>Anyway, coz I was messed up by the fact that for example, both TIB1206A and SMB3099G are stated as KJDEP 67, but the fact is that TIB1206A really came to KJDEP (was on 190) while SMB3099G park at LYDEP but controlled by KJDEP, so is there a way to actually differentiate these 2? Like can still put LYDEP just like buses in BUDEP...</p>
              <p>Also, am I also right to say that now LYDEP is controlled by both AMDEP and KJDEP then? And, buses like SMB3099G can only do 61 and 67 then since only these 2 controlled by KJDEP?</p>

                      TIB1206A and SMB3099G are stated as KJDEP 67, but the fact is that
                      TIB1206A really came to KJDEP (was on 190) while SMB3099G park at
                      LYDEP but controlled by KJDEP, so is there a way to actually
                      differentiate these 2? Like can still put LYDEP just like
                      buses in BUDEP...</p>
              <p>Also, am I also right to say that now LYDEP is controlled
                      by both AMDEP and KJDEP then? And, buses like SMB3099G can only do
                      61 and 67 then since only these 2 controlled by KJDEP?</p>
              <p>Sorry, correct me if im wrong. Still blur HAHA! </p>

              <p>LYDEP is like BUDEP to KJ lor.. for overnight parking only (bus still controlled and deployed by KJ).. just like svc 75, 184, 700 (accdg to wiki) will park @ WL bus park overnight</p>
