              <p>MORE trains with about a third of their seats removed will ply the MRT tracks from next week, even as commuters yesterday said they found the trains no less crowded as a result.</p>
              <p>An SMRT train with 84 of its 300 seats taken out made its debut 1-1/2 weeks ago.</p>
              <p>One such train will be added to the network every week from next week, so that by the end of January, 10 modified trains will be in use along the SMRT's North-South and East-West lines during the morning peak hours.</p>
              <p>Trains on the North-East Line are unaffected by this change, which the Land Transport Authority (LTA) says aims to give standing commuters more space.</p>
              <p>The intention is not to fit more people on the train, it added.</p>
              <p>But that seems to be what is happening. Nine of 10 commuters travelling during yesterday's morning rush hour told The Straits Times that they did not have any more room while standing.</p>
              <p>And then when the crowds thinned, some stood, longing for a seat.</p>
              <p>Customer service officer Sunarti Rohijan, 37, takes an hour-long ride every morning from Bukit Gombak to Tampines, and usually gets a seat from City Hall.</p>
              <p>She said, as the train pulled into Aljunied station: 'It is not much different when it's crowded at Raffles Place and City Hall, but now, when it's emptier, I still have to stand all the way.'</p>
              <p>Asked whether SMRT planned to roll out more than 10 trains with 84 fewer seats each, its chief executive Saw Phaik Hwa said she was aware that some people liked to have seats.</p>
              <p>'So if you remove too many seats, people will say: 'Wow, why no seats?' So I think it's a balance of the two,' she said.</p>
              <p>LTA said it was tracking the situation.</p>
              <p>In an e-mail reply yesterday, it said that while some people preferred the seats to stay, others have said that their priority was to be able to board the train during the peak hour.</p>
              <p>Removing some seats would thus raise people's chances of boarding the train and give standing commuters more room, it said.</p>

              <p>Contradictory of LTA's statement or engrish mistake.</p>
              <p>But in turn, increasing trains means increasing expenditure to run the trains (train drivers, more electrical power), maybe become less revenue.</p>

              <p>yes it can be seen. but there will be more trains in a few years, surely frequency can become better? im also quite sure when frequency of trains are better, there would be more drivers who may be more willing to switch to public transport which in turn still increases their profits.</p>

              <p>Well, we have an uncaring govt, so this is nothing surprising.    Keep increasing fares and then provide fewer seats, we are short changed.    They don't give a damn to provide need to the aging population to create more seats for the senior citizens.   </p>

              <p><br>Yes, they can cater to more people, standing can save space for more commuters to take the bus/train.   But they fail to address the issue of providing need to the aging population.   There are more and more people getting old and these people need seats in the bus and train.    Just vote them out.</p>

              <p>The frequencies are already running so short, you can't even make a seamless synchronised transfer at City Hall or Raffles Place because the trains can't even keep up to schedule with all that bunching.
              <br><br>
              And trains are spotted bunching and running at 2-minute headway into town at 9pm.
