              <p>I read somewhere that Bedok Bus Interchange is the oldest existing bus interchange in Singapore if I remember correctly; that bus interchange, I believe, has seen both the birth and death of CSS throughout it's entire venerable life. In fact, there's even an old 1970's era CSS bus guide somewhere in the Lee Kong Chian (sp?) Reference Library whose cover shows a very old CSS bus on route 608 (then simply route 8) at Bedok Bus Interchange, which looks virtually the same as it is today!</p>
              <p>Another remarkable fact about the interchange is this: at one time, it was the only bus interchange in Singapore that was receiving high-floor, low-floor, air-conditoned, non air-conditioned, SBS Transit, SMRT (then TIBS), CSS, single-deck, double-deck, bendy (both SMRT's and SBS Transit's two bendy bus demonstrators), diesel, and CNG buses <strong>all at one go</strong>.</p>

              <p>Bedok Interchange is really old in my opinion. From what you guys said here that the Interchange is built in early 80's, that may have well reflects it's age as the interchange sees heavy traffic of N113CRBs, MK3, VSO, B9TL and many other models.

              <p>Excluding the United Bus Company one at Lorong 1 Blk 110, ie only the ones at Toa Payoh Central, there have been 4 changes, ie 5 terminals altogether.</p>
              <p>1st one was just a bus park AFAIK, no boarding and alighting allowed, located on the plot of land between Lor 2 and Toa Payoh Centre's service road (ie the current road leading to HDB Hub and Blk 190). Boarding was done outside Blk 192, and alighting was done opposite or at the bus stop outside Blk 175.</p>
              <p>2nd one was a temporary one, the terminal had to be shifted becuase of MRT construction. This one was located on the plot of land beside 184 and 188 (the old hawker centre, now Blk 470, aka Crystal Jade).</p>
              <p>3rd one was the more famous one, the "permanent" structure, located between the service road and the current feeder alighting berths (the current alighting berths is (almost) at the same location as the old one). This one had a block number, Blk 189 and was built possibly under the same contract as Blk 180 (MRT &amp; Singapore's first aircon food court) and Blk 190 (the row of shops with MSCP above). The bus stops outside and opposite Blk 192 were abolished.</p>
              <p>4th one is another temporary one, this was built due to the construction of the HDB Hub (someone decided to move from Bukit Merah). This is located at Toa Payoh town garden, and caused the tower in the garden to be temporarily part of the interchange. The current bus stops outside and opposite Blk 192 were created then to allow people to board at the town centre without walking a long distance and crossing the road to the interchange. One interesting note is that both 232 White plate and 232 Green plate used the bus stop outside Blk 192 (52509)</p>
              <p>5th one is the current one, opened on 19th May 2002. Still looks quite new.</p>

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>Seems like I got only the 3rd/4th/5th one partially right :).</p>
              <p>Then may I enquire where were these pictures taken from? They seem like they were taken from the direction of the current town park towards block 190...I vaguely have an impression of those places...but I can't exactly pinpoint the whereabouts or maybe I'm simply just dreaming :D. But I know I've definitely been to the one before the demolishment in 1999 as 139 had been rerouted to ply Whampoa before the demolishment.</p>

              <p>1st one was just a bus park AFAIK, no boarding and alighting allowed, located on the plot of land between Lor 2 and Toa Payoh Centre's service road (ie the current road leading to HDB Hub and Blk 190).

              <p>Hi!</p>
              <p>Seems like I got only the 3rd/4th/5th one partially right :).</p>
              <p>Then may I enquire where were these pictures taken from? They seem like they were taken from the direction of the current town park towards block 190...I vaguely have an impression of those places...but I can't exactly pinpoint the whereabouts or maybe I'm simply just dreaming :D. But I know I've definitely been to the one before the demolishment in 1999 as 139 had been rerouted to ply Whampoa before the demolishment.</p>

              <p>Okay..then it wouldn't be the temporary structure in 1999 right? I don't recall the temporary structure looking like this but instead had a tall red structure very close to the PIE exit/entrance...hmm....so which one was it?

              <p>the interchange in the pictures is old permanent interchange (since 1983 or 84 -not too sure). You can see the old Toa payoh Cinema in the background (whichis the current Toa payoh entertainment complex). This is situated on the current HDB Hub main office area which incorporate the interchange as well. The temporary structure is mention by Scania in his Point 4. The tall structure is the town park tower..</p>

              <p>Okay...from the picture, the cinema is opposite the interchange with a road in the middle as seen from the cars (not sure if its the service road or lorong 6), and since the picture was taken from the direction of the town park into central, the interchange would have been at the side of the town park from what I gather...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'll reread this tomorrow, seemingly I'm not getting it..maybe just tired. If I still don't get it, maybe I'll just look up some old reference books.</p>
              <p>Thanks alot!</p>
              <p>By the way, the tall red strucutre I was referring to was not the town park tower ;). That was somewhere in the middle iirc, near where the buses park. I was referring to the metal structure of the interchange itself which had its back facing the slip road into PIE.</p>

              <p>Eh, it was since the completion of Toa Payoh MRT station, definitely not 1984, 1984, they were still using the temporary one. Maybe 1985, Toa Payoh station TOP in 1985.</p>

              <p>I read somewhere that Bedok Bus Interchange is the oldest existing bus interchange in Singapore if I remember correctly; that bus interchange, I believe, has seen both the birth and death of CSS throughout it's entire venerable life. In fact, there's even an old 1970's era CSS bus guide somewhere in the Lee Kong Chian (sp?) Reference Library whose cover shows a very old CSS bus on route 608 (then simply route 8) at Bedok Bus Interchange, which looks virtually the same as it is today!</p>
              <p>Another remarkable fact about the interchange is this: at one time, it was the only bus interchange in Singapore that was receiving high-floor, low-floor, air-conditoned, non air-conditioned, SBS Transit, SMRT (then TIBS), CSS, single-deck, double-deck, bendy (both SMRT's and SBS Transit's two bendy bus demonstrators), diesel, and CNG buses <strong>all at one go</strong>.</p>
