            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to The Straits Times, Prime News, pg 4, "ERP rates at some gantries to go up from Monday" dated 1st May 07.<br><br>"Drivers of heavy trucks and buses will incur a hefty $9 charge"<br><br>I remembered reading in the newspapers many years back that public buses only need to pay 3/4 of the ERP charge.<br><br>But I strongly feel public buses should be TOTALLY EXEMPTED from paying ERP charges! What is the motive of ERP? to reduce traffice jams, discourage people from driving and encourage public transport ridership? Then if this is the case, buses are helping to relief traffic congestion and instead of being given rebates, they are being penalised! and does this discourage our public bus operators to deploy extra buses during peak periods because of the ERP charges?<br><br>and even for private buses - regardless of Scheme B, ferrying school children or workers; the same argument applies. and is this another reason to increase bus fares in the coming months too?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eX.A.K.R.:</div><div class="quote_body">...actually, I can confirm that public buses are not charged for the system.<br><br>I was once on a route 175 bus coming back from CMPB. As the bus swung onto Orchard Road, I decided to go forward to have a peek at the IU over there (the Orchard gantry was operating at that time). When the bus passed underneath the gantry, "$0.00" showed up on the IU's display.</div></blockquote>but i ever remembered reading in the Straits times years back that public buses got to pay ERP charges, but at 3/4 of the rates for normal lorries &amp; buses. maybe the LTA later reversed its policies against charging public buses? and what about private buses and school buses? though they occupy road space, they are in fact helping to reducing traffic congestion by moving the masses!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>officially they must say that public bus have to pay, but unofficially they no need to pay.<br><br>initially, when just started , i think they did pay ERP, cos there is some stickers on the dashboard or driver's cabin, reminding them to insert cash card or something like that..<br><br>after that, dunno why policy change, but no official news were announced.</div>
