I just check in The Street Directory that to my horror, the bus stop opposite Hong Lim Cplx I assume that you are referring to Upper Cross St B01 to be exact, is nearer to Chinatown MRT than to Clarke Quay MRT.<br><br>The bus stop that is at North Bridge Rd B01 is nearer to Clarke Quay MRT in my opinion.<br><br>It is funny as in the above quote, you try to advertise that that bus stop is the [b]nearest, safe and official way</strong> to Clarke Quay.<br><br>Let be realistic shall we? There will be no end to the quarrelling if it continues. I am just trying to be specific here. Let me stress that a person can walk from that bus stop to Clarke Quay MRT if he thinks that is the official way to there.<br>To me, who cares as long as he can reach the destination?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>In short, I just want to say that the traffic lights are for human to cross. I just use the correct way that people should go to the nearest MRT station. More importantly, that route is just my personal suggested route. U guys can find ur own route that u find it comfortable and no point arguing cos it would nv end.</div>

This is the first time I know of such associations from someone is in knowledge of the area. And now someone who has debated so much about 174 skipping "Central" and at the same time suggesting that those headed for "Hong Lim Complex" should not jaywalk from Boat Quay bus stop has not mentioned a solution because for all we know, 174 does not stop at "Central".<br><br>And stop acting like a hypocrite who tries to care yet criticizes. It will not do you any good.<br><br>PS: Other than "chickenlittle2", you should interpret "Hong Lim Complex" as "Clarke Quay Stn" and vice versa.</div></blockquote>Slowly I dun understand wat u r talking.

What will you do to get to "Hong Lim Complex" since the bus does not stop at "Central"?<br><br>[b]</blockquote>So again, I ask u which direction right? U say going "Hong Lim Cplx". Do u know where is "Hong Lim Cplx"? Did I understand u in a wrong way?  If u r going to "Hong Lim Cplx", u should alight at "Apollo Ctr". For better illustration, if the bus is heading Boon Lay then stop at the bus stop at "Apollo Ctr" and walk to Hong Lim Cplx lor.. In the first ever reply, I had state the reasons why Svc 174  going towards new bridge rd did not call at the bus stop opp Hong Lim park (another bus stop to clarke quay stn).<br><br>In conclusion,to get to "central" and not "The Central" or "Central Square" and decide to take Svc 174 there or the either way to take this service pls alight or board the bus stop at "Apollo Ctr".  U just need to walk straight and cross the route to "Central".<br><br>I am just sharing my own opinion, I am just want to say wat I thinks it is right. If it make u think in another way, all I want to say is u r thinking too much.<br></div>

But you have mentioned that Clarke Quay Stn is nearer to Hong Lim Complex. If you were to recommending alighting at Boat Quay, why do you bother question the decision to skip "opp Hong Lim Complex" in the first place?<br><br>Why wasn't Service 2, 12, 54, 190 sacrificed then? Are you confirmed that the demand for 174 is way lower than any of the services to justify your reasons?<br><br>How confident are you that everyone who has alighted at Boat Quay bus stop headed for Central will not cross the road? In the same way, if you are not confident of crossing the road, you won't be doing that in the first place. Are you the kind that will follow directions blindly? Do you seek to be unrealistically righteous?</div>
