            <div class='col-md body'>i noticed those Volvo MK4 strider buses eg SBS1954S:<br><br>the windscreen wipers are rather short. when it rains, the wipers are unable to reach higher up the windscreen and i noticed the BC's eyelevel is already higher that the wipe area!<br><br>i think this is rather dangerous, esp if the BC activates the wipers to clear the AC mist condensation on the windscreen which is very obstructive. if the mist are not cleared adequately, it may affect the BC's vision.<br><br>i think the wipers come in standard length, but can be aligned and adjusted to clear the windscreen area higher up.<br><br>any comments?</div>

Another example is SBS 9688H <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  (89 HGDEP). This bus also have problems especially with it's EDS.

Much more faster than SBS Transit buses. So they are used to driving faster.
