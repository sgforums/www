            <div class='col-md body'>1. Yesterday I was back on my favourite VO for the second time (I mean, specifically the bus alone).<br><br>It's SBS 9474H on Service 14 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>a) The BC is doing duty 9A at that time. When I checked on one of his timings against my watch, I found that the bus was late. The original time of arrival at T2 (Bedok Interchange) was supposed to be '1313', however, it was not as shown on my watch.<br>Next, I checked the driver's DDU and I saw that the arrival time was pushed back to 1333 hrs. I guessed that the BC must have had a delay and so had his timing adjusted back at Clementi.<br>When the bus arrived in Bedok, it clocked in at 1352 hrs. Doing the Math, I found that it was 39 minutes behind schedule.<br>Did anyone know what happened to this bus in the morning?

If not, then its not me. Up to you to determine.<br><br>2. Its opposite Apex Tower along Anson rd. For goodness sake please check the st directory. Its not like army camps where even the st directory may not give u any result. Take any bus that goes to Anson rd except 57 131.<br><br>3. How come u and that Yuen Shek Ngai or STN or whoever seems to have a similar connection. Both live in Bedok, seems to be a avid fan of KTM trains, and both post questions or things that can be done by yourself and yet still ask. Take 30 to the railway station. End of Story.<br><br>and for goodness sake please dont ask the person who replied u with the timing and/or angle for the timing for the S30 to leave BDK so that u can be there to snap trains...<br></div>
