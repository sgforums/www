I had been given presentation to my boss, my boss want me to write and talk in details to reduce confusion and misunderstanding. More importantly, when I ask u which direction, u can just give the direction. If you just reply properly and give the direction, you think this arguement would happen? Why you want to argue now and not doing the correct thing in the first place?<br><br>Hey hey, What is confident? U can just walk a few metres to refrain urself risking ur life? The traffic light give you the confidence of not getting into any trouble. U r the one who says why we must follow the law blindly, so u mean the law set are not for us to follow?

I'm speaking to a virtual entity named chickenlittle2. Is that how?<br><br>And now you want to talk about train no 174? Why don't you start discussing it in the Singapore Trains forum? Why did not bother replying to my post in a Singapore Buses forum post? How the hell did you came to the conclusion that this particular "174" entity is going to "New Bridge Rd" and for some reason does not want to stop at "opp Hong Lim Complex".<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by chickenlittle2:<br>U mean the direction towards New bridge Rd?</blockquote>How dare you question whether what I am doing is correct or wrong. You were clearly in good knowledge of the area yet decide to impose upon others to right your wrong's. What I had given is clear. I will not understand how you can equate an exact location described to a building 400m away from the station itself, with its closest MRT exit belonging to another station.<br><br>If you need more clarification that I am talking about buses and not some weird entity with a weird number, then you can possibly do that if I had made the fault at another forum. Which level of spoonfeeding do you need? Do I have to substantiate my question with photos and maps just to make myself clear? If this is the case, on my personal level I will not bother replying to your reply and you have got that clear in my very first reply to you.<br><br>I did not say we must follow the law blindly, in fact you had criticised me of not following the law, how then do you come to the conclusion that I said that? Do you now accuse that I do not act what I have preached? Who are you to give directions? How do you define defiant when you are not in a position of law to punish the accused? What is the motive you are seeking in reproducing the law in front of me? Don't be a hypocrite, we're in an argument and don't try to shed tears of a crocodile. Your only concern of whether I will get into trouble is so that you can get revenge over this.</div>

Mind you that there are barriers on the side of the road along Fook Hai Building, and it links to the HDB blocks.<br><br>How detailed do you want? Do you want me to treat you differently, that "opp Hong Lim Complex" is "Clarke Quay Stn" and vice versa, simply because you think "Clarke Quay Stn" bus stop is not as close to Clarke Quay Stn as "opp Hong Lim Complex" is!<br><br>So what? I have taken pains to reiterate to you that the crossings on either side of the bus stop are more than 100 metres away. It is you who decides to set the rules. And you are saying I'm repeating to get my point through. Why have you not addressed the issue of why "opp Hong Lim Complex" bus stop is nearer to Clarke Quay Stn then "Clarke Quay Stn" itself is. Does walking a long underpass to get to the exit count? Or one which is accessible right above ground after you step out of the ticket gate. You might as well have a "Singapore" bus stop because everything is so near everything else to you.<br><br>Have you realised that the picture has been resized to a resolution where you cannot identify the people? So what if they can see? They can't prosecute with my evidence. I have already thought of that when I took the pictures. And which part of my words did I imply that jaywalking is "cool"? And what right do you have to question those people who wants to do so? They do so on their own free will, not within 100 metres of the nearest crossing.<br><br>First you want people to do voluntary work just because they are too free, next you want people not to do this when they are entirely legal to do so.

Is you blood boiling over the fact that I can treat your argument seriously and beat you to it?<br><br>There is an overhead bridge. Mind you that there are barriers on the side of the road along Fook Hai Building, and it links to the HDB blocks.<br><br>How detailed do you want? Do you want me to treat you differently, that "opp Hong Lim Complex" is "Clarke Quay Stn" and vice versa, simply because you think "Clarke Quay Stn" bus stop is not as close to Clarke Quay Stn as "opp Hong Lim Complex" is!<br><br>So what? I have taken pains to reiterate to you that the crossings on either side of the bus stop are more than 100 metres away. It is you who decides to set the rules. And you are saying I'm repeating to get my point through. Why have you not addressed the issue of why "opp Hong Lim Complex" bus stop is nearer to Clarke Quay Stn then "Clarke Quay Stn" itself is. Does walking a long underpass to get to the exit count? Or one which is accessible right above ground after you step out of the ticket gate. You might as well have a "Singapore" bus stop because everything is so near everything else to you.<br><br>Have you realised that the picture has been resized to a resolution where you cannot identify the people? So what if they can see? They can't prosecute with my evidence. I have already thought of that when I took the pictures. And which part of my words did I imply that jaywalking is "cool"? And what right do you have to question those people who wants to do so? They do so on their own free will, not within 100 metres of the nearest crossing.<br><br>First you want people to do voluntary work just because they are too free, next you want people not to do this when they are entirely legal to do so. I think you are a busybody and you think too much and try to make a mountain out of a molehill.</div></blockquote>Nono, I am not angry at all..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I had been laughing throughout and see how serious u r trying to make up ur mistake..

Once again, if u just give the exact direction that svc 174 is heading I would defintely know which bus stop u r talking at..<br><br>U can call or E-mail the TP whether ur actions is right or wrong lor..

With such knowledge you cannot be unsure of what lies right above Clarke Quay Stn. Sure if you're at a loss people will help you, but are you at a loss in the first place? You can even say out one direction of 174. You can even print the map out and show me. Now answer my question and tell me the reason about U82. Ask your relatives now.<br><br>Good.
