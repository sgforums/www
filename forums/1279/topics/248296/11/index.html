The DD bus in New Police Story very old already! Thin metal! B9TL new new where gt thin metal. It will end up worse than that DD bus in New Police Story!!! Like a fire. I have 5 questions.<br><br>1. why don't 138 use DD? Frequency quite bad and the passengers like half of the SD bus liao during the afternoon. Even worse when peak hours where the bus very full though i know the bus will not be full till night safari/zoo.<br><br>2. As someone said. Some BC were saying that 13 is getting DD buses and most likely WAB SD buses. Is 13 having the DDs soon? How about 162?<br><br>3. I may sound stupid asking so much question. But are these buses hindered by height restrictions: 24,53,54,57,58,59,82,156,159?<br><br>4. Service 166 has perm B9TL before? SBS 7334S?<br><br>5. Is SBS 2811P the only SD bus where there is one or more ez-link card readers being purple orange (which only B9TL has)? I remember it was replaced 1 of the readers due to its faultiness. Is there any more of them having purple orange ez-link card readers beside this? Can state?</div></blockquote>1) Why 138 don't use DD? in the first place 138 got side rectangular desto? thats why 138 nvr use MK4 Strider or DM3500 cameo before , i guess..<br><br>2) Just be patience will do , 162 use DD?

I saw a off service Trident running along Sixth Ave last year. Also, the former Sv5 (the one which terminates at Geylang Lor 1 Terminal) used to have quite a large DD fleet, and it ran through Sixth Ave. The main reason should be because the demand is too low. Sometimes off peak the frequency is approximately 15-18 mins, yet you still can find a seat onboard. There was not once when I took 156 I had to stand, and I have taken 156 for the past 5 years on an almost daily basis.</div>

I was under the impression that DD were 12m long. Seems like its not. Assuming that DD have better turning radius than Bendy, then it should not be a problem. I made reference to a bendy because a Habit camoe on Sv77 last month, and Sv77 runs through Sixth Ave.</div>

You wan the roof to disappear ?<br><br>- NO. There's alot of buses with the new Ezlink reader.<br><br>* Although SBST have DDs in their fleet, that doesnt mean that every service should get them. you must understand that theres always a reson on how they deploy their buses. Itz good that you ask questions. But, ask it the right way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay... from what i can see... you really need a long time to understand a lot of things... really... a LOT of things... As a senior memebr lurking around in this forum, I have seen a lot of these 'not so intelligent' questions made, but well it's alright. It's a learning process by you people, and hence please do give some of the people here the patience to explain.<br><br>Let me take a look at the questions that you have posted here:<br><br>1. why don't 138 use DD? Frequency quite bad and the passengers like half of the SD bus liao during the afternoon. Even worse when peak hours where the bus very full though i know the bus will not be full till night safari/zoo.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Very good question, but oh c'mon. Are you able to give me an analysis that in every minute, 30 tourists are lining up at Service 138 berth to get to the zoo?<br><br>2. As someone said. Some BC were saying that 13 is getting DD buses and most likely WAB SD buses. Is 13 having the DDs soon? How about 162?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Not all the time the BCs would get the latest information on these issues, e.g. 13 gets double deck buses. The reason why you don't see it happening is because that there may be some problems behind and hence it has been put off. I am not inclined to see Service 162 for getting DDs at this moment.<br><br>3. I may sound stupid asking so much question. But are these buses hindered by height restrictions: 24,53,54,57,58,59,82,156,159?<br><br>&gt;&gt; Service 24, 53, 159: These services can't have DDs as they're passing through places with the height restriction of 3.8 - 3.9 metres.<br>Service 57, 58, and 59... I would say more analysis is needed before the company decides to operate DDs on them. It is also subjective to if the company has enuff DDs to support the operation. 82 and 156... u should know if they warrant DDs through the loading through various hours of the day. Service 54... refer to 82 and 156.<br><br>4. Service 166 has perm B9TL before? SBS 7334S<br>&gt;&gt; No. Serice 166 doesn't even have any permanent Volvo B9TLs right from the start. Moreover, it isn't an official WAB sv.<br><br>5. Is SBS 2811P the only SD bus where there is one or more ez-link card readers being purple orange (which only B9TL has)? I remember it was replaced 1 of the readers due to its faultiness. Is there any more of them having purple orange ez-link card readers beside this? Can state?[/<br>&gt;&gt; Over time, some ez-link readers will spoil due to frequent usage, and hence they may be beyond repairing. What SBST would do is to take them off and replace with the new ones. Pretty simple logic though.<br><br>Well folks, if you guys do have such kind of questions, you can email to me @ sbs9678l@yahoo.com.sg Hope to find time to answer your queries if possible. Perhaps a new posting topic would be set up to entertain such questions as well.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BusSpeeder:</div><div class="quote_body">i forgot 105 runs through lorong chuan mah.
