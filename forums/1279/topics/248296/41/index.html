If you had just asked for which direction I was referring to for clarifications we would have helped you.<br><br>But apparently you went on to show that you had better knowledge of the buses and landmarks in the area than the rest. If you can go on so much about getting to Hong Lim Park and Clarke Quay MRT, there is not question you will not know I was referring to the pair of bus stops named after the station itself.<br><br>And now, if you really do know the area well, you will definitely know why it does not call at the bus stop opposite Hong Lim Complex, and also why 174 is not the only bus that skips this bus stop, which would have made my initial question redundant in the first place.<br><br>You had clearly known your stuffs but choose to nitpick and be ignorant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the reason is the same as to why Svc 73 towards Toa Payoh direction does not call at the bus stop After Serangoon Nth Ave 1.<br><br>The bus need sufficient road space to filter out into the most right hand lane for right turning thereafter. Thus the reason.<br><br>Chill it guys.</div>

If you had just asked for which direction I was referring to for clarifications we would have helped you.<br><br>But apparently you went on to show that you had better knowledge of the buses and landmarks in the area than the rest. If you can go on so much about getting to Hong Lim Park and Clarke Quay MRT, there is not question you will not know I was referring to the pair of bus stops named after the station itself.<br><br>And now, if you really do know the area well, you will definitely know why it does not call at the bus stop opposite Hong Lim Complex, and also why 174 is not the only bus that skips this bus stop, which would have made my initial question redundant in the first place.<br><br>You had clearly known your stuffs but choose to nitpick and be ignorant.</div></blockquote>This is getting funny. In the first place, if u could just answer me directly and not beating around the bush that would cause so much misunderstanding.. Some people regard the Hong Lim Cplx as Clarke Quay Stn and some regard the "offical" bus stop as Clarke Quay Station. Since u r talking about "Clarke Quay Station", next time it would be good if u can point out the important landmark like "Central Square".<br><br>For now, I can answer ur question. Svc 174 does not stop at the "Clarke Quay Station" (Central Square) because the bus stop at Apollo Ctr is quite near to Central Square(Just need to cross a road").</div>

One who takes 174 on the opposite end and wants to get to Clarke Quay Stn will alight at Boat Quay.<br><br>If I wanted to pose a question about Hong Lim Cplx, I would have said so. I do not understand which part of my post allows you to interpret "Clarke Quay Stn" as "Hong Lim Cplx", and I am sure I am not the one being ambigious here.<br><br>"Central Square", for your information, lies at Havelock Rd. You probably meant "The Central" outside the bus stop where my doubts lie.<br><br>And finally, to answer your last point, all scheduled full-day services calling at Apollo Ctr (2,12,33,51,61,63,80,174,197,961) also call at Clarke Quay Stn bus stop except 174.</div>
