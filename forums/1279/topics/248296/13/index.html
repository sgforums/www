(That was the reason for my preference to Scania N113CRB than to the MKIIs because the front of the MKII looks ugly.)<br><br>The side of the bus also bore distinctive features too. I recommend you look at the side where there is the door. Those of MKII are not flush to the surface; they are much more positioned into the interior of the bus but Scanias and Mercs don't. Also, all Merc WAs are OAC, so there is no chance that you can't differentiate a Scania from the other two.<br><br>The back is also crucial evidence to the body of these three. For MKIIs, the rego is positioned inwards. Tapering can be seen on all three sides: top, right and left. For Scania, the rego is positioned much to the right when you see the back facing you. Tapering can only be seen on the top of the bus. And for a Merc, the rego is to the centre and not inwards like MKIIs. The best thing to note for this kind: the placement of the signals. They are normally placed horizontally, not vertically.<br><br>For your reference, here are two pictures to show the evidence of the different types of bodies for different types of buses.<br><br><a href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u197/SBS7363H/SBS%20Transit/58ce03a9.jpg" rel="nofollow">Volvo B10M MKII WA</a><br><a href="http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u197/SBS7363H/SBS%20Transit/5faa96cd.jpg" rel="nofollow">Scania N113CRB</a><br><br>Ask someone else for Mercedes Benz O405 WAs.</div>

In fact I just took it from a remote stand to the airport terminal in Los Angeles. However, it seemed quite normal sized on the tarmac. Maybe its because the planes near by made it look big. Does anyone know the if cobus or any other bus company makes articulated airport buses too? I sat on a articulated one, which was also low floor but with a high rear (like the CNG) supposedly to house the engine.</div>

The smaller side vents are supplementary openings, I guess. Some old NAC buses do have these 'side' vents, the Volvo B57 and the MB OF1417, for example. How much these smaller vents contribute to the radiator's performance is unknown. But the fact that these smaller vents are being sealed up, I guess its insignificant.</div>
