This is the first time I know of such associations from someone is in knowledge of the area. And now someone who has debated so much about 174 skipping "Central" and at the same time suggesting that those headed for "Hong Lim Complex" should not jaywalk from Boat Quay bus stop has not mentioned a solution because for all we know, 174 does not stop at "Central".<br><br>And stop acting like a hypocrite who tries to care yet criticizes. It will not do you any good.<br><br>PS: Other than "chickenlittle2", you should interpret "Hong Lim Complex" as "Clarke Quay Stn" and vice versa.</div>

When I look at the replies, lol, it is very funny. I just check in The Street Directory that to my horror, the bus stop opposite Hong Lim Cplx I assume that you are referring to Upper Cross St B01 to be exact, is nearer to Chinatown MRT than to Clarke Quay MRT.<br><br>The bus stop that is at North Bridge Rd B01 is nearer to Clarke Quay MRT in my opinion.<br><br>It is funny as in the above quote, you try to advertise that that bus stop is the <strong>nearest, safe and official way</strong> to Clarke Quay.<br><br>Let be realistic shall we? There will be no end to the quarrelling if it continues. I am just trying to be specific here. Let me stress that a person can walk from that bus stop to Clarke Quay MRT if he thinks that is the official way to there.<br>To me, who cares as long as he can reach the destination?<br><br>And by the way, just a qn of curosity, a similar qn, why does 105, 109 doesn't stop at S'goon Ctrl bus stop B03 at Blk 261 whereas 315 stop there?<br></div>
