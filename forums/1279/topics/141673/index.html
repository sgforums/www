Service 83 acts as a feeder service for pax staying in Punggol to neighbouring Sengakng which has more facilities. Demand is also damn high that the queueing berth has been extended right to the alighting berth.

Service 83 acts as a feeder service for pax staying in Punggol to neighbouring Sengakng which has more facilities. Demand is also damn high that the queueing berth has been extended right to the alighting berth. Observe the number of pax boarding it at any time and you will see why SBST still keeps this service.</div></blockquote>the more the reason they should find an excuse to put DDs on the service.<br><br>by integrating 83 and 153 together the 153s DDs can run on that part of the route as well<br><br>ZYX</div>
