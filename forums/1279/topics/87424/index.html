But I dun see need for SMRTB as they have said that such short disruption MAY not have shuttles especially they are during off peak. (I'm say MAY as it is case by case basis)<br><br>I example, mths bef a lighting struck on a rail track bet Yishun and Sembawang. Train sv was disrupted. No shuttles were provided but Tibs increased 851 frequency</div>
