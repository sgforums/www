            <div class='col-md body'>No talk on NEL deal yet, says SMRT chief<br>Denying rumours that SBS Transit and SMRT met, Ms Saw says she doesn't even know if NEL is for sale<br><br>By Goh Chin Lian<br><br>NEARLY three months after the Government said it made sense for transport operator SMRT to take over the loss-making North-East Line (NEL), SMRT says it has yet to meet the line's operator on the matter, even though industry talk is that the two have met.<br><br>Yesterday, SMRT chief executive Saw Phaik Hwa denied SMRT had spoken to SBS Transit.<br><br>'We have no idea that anyone has talked to anyone in the organisation,' she said.<br><br>She then added: 'I heard the ridership has gone up quite a lot recently because of Chinese New Year, so they must be doing better.<br><br>'So I'm not sure if it's for sale or not for sale. You should ask the person who's talking to you whether it's for sale first.'<br><br>Asked about talk of the meetings and Ms Saw's comments, SBS Transit, NEL's operator, said yesterday: 'It is not our policy to discuss such issues.'<br><br>But, it confirmed that the number of trips has increased by 10 to 20 per cent in the first two weeks of this month in the run-up to Chinese New Year, compared to the same period over the previous two months, but declined to reveal absolute figures.<br><br><strong>Only about 170,000 trips were made on the NEL each day previously, instead of the 250,000 initially projected. </strong>This means the line could chalk up a loss of $20 million to $40 million in its first year of operation.<br><br>Ms Saw had said that SBS should 'make me an offer I can't refuse' when Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong floated the idea of SMRT taking over the NEL.<br><br>This prompted Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to remark: 'If I were SBS, I'd ask SMRT to make me an offer I can't refuse either.'<br><br>Yesterday, Ms Saw maintained that any deal between SMRT and SBS would have to be 'commercially driven' as 'we have shareholders to answer to', when asked if her company would take over the NEL if it is for sale.<br><br>'We're always looking at business deals of any kind,' she hedged.<br><br>Asked about her expectations of the Circle Line, which her company will operate, she said that SMRT is 'very bullish' about its prospects. <strong>Its calculations match the Land Transport Authority's of 500,000 passengers a day, </strong>she added. The Circle Line, which will have interchanges at Bishan, Serangoon and Paya Lebar, is scheduled to open in stages from 2007.<br><br>Unlike the NEL, for which ridership predictions were based on expected growth in areas that were still to be developed, the Circle Line will run through mature estates that already have a 'captive audience'.<br><br>'We know exactly how many people there are in the areas and how many will take the MRT, so fluctuations won't be far off,' she said, after a ceremony to commend 516 front-line staff for good service.<br><br>At the event, SMRT also showcased the new lilac and orchid-pink uniforms that all 5,900 front-line personnel from its train, bus and taxi services will don from Thursday.<br><br></div>
