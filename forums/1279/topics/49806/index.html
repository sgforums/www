            <div class='col-md body'>The NEL has started operation. So, more passengers along the North-East areas may switch from taking bus to taking train, bus services along the areas may see a sharp decrease in passenger loads, then SBST has to replace the double deckers with single deckers and frequency will also be longer.<br><br>If you see any fleet changes or other changes in bus services that plys Punggol, Sengkang, Jln Kayu, Hougang, Serangoon North, Serangoon town centre, Potong Pasir and Little India areas in the next 3 months.

In the manner, they can let go the single deckers to some other single-deck only services which need more buses.</div>

You suay lohz, I found out the VSO passing by your place at 5.45am is 9816E making its way for Sv. 56 first trip of the day. It leaves BRAM at 5.38am, departs Marina at 6.00am. Was looking at timesheet of bus driver. And the 6.15am VSO is definitely 9816E again.</div>
