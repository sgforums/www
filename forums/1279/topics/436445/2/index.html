                  I almost puke out my lunch when I saw this! I rather take the

                  fav among the Volvo buses , glad they are going off and lo's aircon
                  is weak, but they are not too shabby ! Still all of these buses are
                  still better f lousy scania kubs.</p>

                  Any SBST bus, even a KUB or MK3, is still a tad better than any of the whole fleet of poorly maintained SMRT buses, seriously.
                  
                  As for this stomp article, the poster is most likely a spoilt brat who doesn't appreciate the beauty of old things and wants everything new and sees old things as an eyesore.

              compare...<br>
              IF you compare similar buses in HK, SG WEG CANNOT make it in terms
              of acceleration, pick up and aircon...<br>

              Got to agree on the Citaro air con. SBST needs to improve on the air con outlets. It may be strong but the outlets are too small to make the presence of air con felt. Other than that, the bus is comfortable.
              
              But we got to feel lucky that we have Citaros and Wright B9TLs on our roads. Don't really care if it is faster than KMB's ones. As long as they can run, don't get into frequent accidents, etc, generally people are satisfied. 
              The engine size, pick up and acceleration aspects are most likely to be tightly governed by LTA for emissions, safety purposes when bus companies procure new buses. Hong Kong bus companies are luckier that the government dosen't control everything even in these aspects, and that's why their public transport are much better than Singapore.

              <p>Mr Vicamour, i understand your displease with SMRT service and such. However i reckon you should be more wise in the words and tone used in your sentences. SBST/SMRT alike, we should not defame any company openly. I believe you wont want to get legal actions from any companies for that if they ever take action i suppose? What if one day either company decides to sue SGF and had the website closed down? It is fine if you wish to continue voicing out your unhappiness, but do so discretely, and not placing everyone in any tricky situations.</p>

              If you have noticed, I had tone down my tone against SMRTB, as compared to last time. If they wants to sue people, even at such tones, it shows how terrible the company in reflecting themselves. The fact is that their buses in general are still poorly maintained, despite complains. 
              Given at such kind of attitude, I wonder are they serving the public or are they serving themselves. I have a few unhappy experiences which I can lodge a complain with LTA and PTC, due to their negligence in services and poor maintenance of the buses. Instead of making the public more angry, they should wake up their ideas and buck up in their level of service standards. Given the recent vandalism case in their MRT depot, it really shows what kind of company it is.

              <p>Mr Vicamour, i understand your displease with SMRT service and
              such. However i reckon you should be more wise in the words and
              tone used in your sentences. SBST/SMRT alike, we should not defame
              any company openly. I believe you wont want to get legal actions
              from any companies for that if they ever take action i suppose?
              What if one day either company decides to sue SGF and had the
              website closed down? It is fine if you wish to continue voicing out
              your unhappiness, but do so discretely, and not placing everyone in
              any tricky situations.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't think any companies will file a lawsuit for cases like this. It just shows how this induvidual is a hermit when it comes to SMRT stuff.</p>

              Hope this will brighten up your day. I used to hate B10Ms because of their rattling interiors and generally extremely slow acceleration. But two rides today change my perception. One was on a DM3500 on 58 (don't remember the rego but it was the only DM3500 with plug doors). The acceleration from that 285bhp engine was amazing. 0-40 in less than 6 seconds or so! It was much quieter than the KUBs too. Then, there was the Strider (2626H) on 518. I love the fact that the BC kept speeding to overtake random cars for fun (seriously), then slowing down after passing them. There were a few instances that he hit the rev limiter and went at about 80km/h (no joke, I saw the speedo). I was suddenly hit by the fact that many fellow forumers have been saying. The B10Ms are sure stable as hell. Even when the BC was going at 75km/h around a moderately tight corner, the bus felt so planted!
              
              However, with these being said, some B10Ms are just horrible. SBS1932E is the worst of all the Striders I have ever been on. Smells of crayon, jerks like hell and the engine wails loudly. Even been on fire once. Wonder why the 2xxx series Striders are better.

              <p><br>Got to agree on the Citaro air con. SBST needs to improve on the air con outlets. It may be strong but the outlets are too small to make the presence of air con felt. Other than that, the bus is comfortable. But we got to feel lucky that we have Citaros and Wright B9TLs on our roads. Don't really care if it is faster than KMB's ones. As long as they can run, don't get into frequent accidents, etc, generally people are satisfied. The engine size, pick up and acceleration aspects are most likely to be tightly governed by LTA for emissions, safety purposes when bus companies procure new buses. Hong Kong bus companies are luckier that the government dosen't control everything even in these aspects, and that's why their public transport are much better than Singapore.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>for me the MKIII is like a very dulan teacher in school. No matter how fierce the teacher is (No matter how slow, creepy and bone jolting the MKIII is) I respect it. No matter how fierce the teacher is, he/she teaches u the right things (If u wanna go to Jurong, the MKIII brings u there and not Joo Koon), same like great lenient teachers (Wrights, Citaros and SMRT's future incoming MANs)</p></div>

              <p><br>But HK also has its own problems. Now they're trying to rationalise buses during the off peak hours and those low demand svs.</p>
              <p>Dun forget in HK, you gotta take the correct bus to pay the correct fare. Cannot be taking 960 or 968 to West Kowloon for example.</p>
