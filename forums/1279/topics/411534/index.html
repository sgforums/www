              <p>Since today is the first day of road diversion, <br><br>         Posting based on my observation and it would be a long post. Perhaps those I have mentioned would be the same scenario for the past 2 years.</p>
              <p>Morning wise (around 8am) Traffic was heavy along Upp Pickering St all the way to Church St. For those vehicles turning from South Bridge Rd, traffic started to slow down after Elgin Bridge. Buses was generally late by around 15-20 mins. But heard it was even worse after that.</p>
              <p>Evening wise,<br>Spotted many people waiting for the bus at Robinson Road bus stop.<br>I took Sv 107 at around 6:15pm at Cecil Street Bus Stop. Traffic started to be heavy at Boon Tat Street. It continued along Cross St, Eu Tong Sen St, Hill Street till Middle Road. I took the bus around 1 hour to travel from Cecil St to Beach Rd. Passengers started to build from Beach Rd onwards. <br>The most epic bus stop would be Lavender MRT bus stop, it was packed like sardine. Especially  when the bus reached the bus, people started to crowd over and some boarded from the exit door. Made until the bus to be packed to the door. Most of them are people living in Geylang Bahru. Before that, heard there were 2 Service 61 rigid and one Service 175 passed by, but it is unable to fetch finished the crowd. <br>For 107, commuters have waited around 40+ mins before the bus I was in, arrived at the bus stop.<br>Heard other services were badly affected like Service 197 and 145 (those from Chinatown) etc. <br>Reached back HG, timing was around 8pm.</p>
              <p>Observation, please correct me if I am wrong,<br>Notice Service 106 (twds BBT) it will take a loop at Marina South before heading back to Cecil Street unlike Service 133</p>
              <p>Felt that some services could use ECP instead (e.g. for those buses plying along Beach Rd) Service 57, 100, 107 (Exit via Ophir Road and back to original route)<br>Ticket Inspector can be stationed at Lavender MRT station bus stop to control the crowd during evening peak.</p>
