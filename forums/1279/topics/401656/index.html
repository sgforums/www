Upper floors, need to take lift. At Mongkok MTR Station. There's an exit straight to Langham Place. Or you can take bus. I forgot the numbers. <br><br><strong>Bus Fares in Hong Kong start from the maximum fare, and ultimately reduces to a cheaper fare until it reaches the last stop. </strong><br><br>You can use an Octopus Card (Ba Da Tong) to save, just like our Ezlink.<br>Can buy from the HK Airport, can refund at the Airport too. Many Octopus Card Counters. One just as you exit the airport immigrations, and a few others, including one at the airport MTR station. <br><br>Octopus cards can be used for MTR, bus, trams, ferries, and shops like 7 Eleven etc. <br><br><strong>Airport To City</strong><br>Airport Express by CTB<br>A21 - Airport &gt; Kowloon<br>&amp; Many others. <br><br><strong>CTB</strong><br>629 - Star Ferry (Central) &gt;&gt;&gt; Ocean Park (Only 2 trips in the early mornings.)<br>629 - Admiralty MTR &gt;&gt;&gt; Ocean Park<br><br><strong>NWFB</strong><br>15C - Star Ferry (Central) &gt;&gt;&gt; The Peak (Lower Terminus)<br>15C - The Peak (Lower Terminus) &gt;&gt;&gt; Lan Kwai Fung (Walk over for Yung Kee Roasted Duck)<br><br><strong>KMB</strong><br>1,1A,2 - Star Ferry (Central) &gt;&gt;&gt; Tsim Sha Tsui / Yau Ma Tei / Mongkok<br>104 - Central &gt;&gt;&gt; Kowloon (Via Harbour Tunnel Crossing) Goes to Langham Place also.<br><br><strong>MTR</strong><br>Ngong Ping MTR (Ngong Ping 360)<br><br><strong>Star Ferry </strong><br>Star Ferry (Wan Chai) Hong Kong Convention Centre. <br>Walk over to Central to take Tram... Can go Causeway Bay for a walk via Tram <br>(Tram is on Hong Kong Island... stretching from Kennedy Town to Causeway Bay / Happy Valley)<br> <br>104 - Kennedy Town &gt;&gt;&gt; Kowloon Island (Langham Place)<br><br>Hongkongers generally can speak broken Mandarin with a heavy Cantonese accent. <br>But they do not like to communicate with China people, cos you are "DA LU ZAI" (from China) if you speak Mandarin. <br><br>Restaurants and tea cafes no choice, use Mandarin, and most can understand. <br><br>Tourist places, use English as it is more preferred.  Especially at The Peak, use English. <br><br>English - 3 mins queue, Mandarin - 30 mins queue. China tourists have to queue up as a group and take one tram up as they go up to the peak, as they are extremely rowdy, and Hong Kong control limited numbers of them to go up at one time, so as not to disturb other tourists. <br> <br>At the Madame Tussauds, beware of China tourists also, they push here push there, and when you want to snap a photo, they just WALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR CAMERA. 3 second rule. Prepare how you going to snap, jump into the photo, SNAP and leave. <br><br>At Ocean Park, China Tourists love to jump queue, push here push there, and they risk their lives, jumping to the rides when the ride is in motion. So the staff there do not generally like them, so if you speak Mandarin, you are one of them lah, from China. <br><br>At Ngong Ping, buy crystal cabin tickets... They will give you one empty cabin. The cheaper cabin, 12 person to 1 cabin plus 15 mins queue, beats sharing with China tourists, they will push here push there and start screaming and yelling at the cabin, yeah?<br> <br>Walking with Buddha and Monkey Tales 3D show can consider skipping, a waste of money in general, especially the Monkey Tales. <br><br>I doubt you need to communicate with the bus drivers. There are bus panels everywhere, on each and every bus stop, just like Singapore, and its all in English plus Mandarin characters. <br><br>Can try staying at Evergreen Hotel, cheap, though bathroom condition wasnt that good. The bathtub damn old. LOL... Can try buying 3D2N land tours in Singapore with hotel accomodation. Its cheaper somewhat. <br><br> Try<br>Jetstar<br>Tiger Airways <br><br>Occassionally, <br>Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines have cheap airfares, can check them out.</p></div>

              <p>I recomment to take Kowloon Motor Bus Rt. 72 non-air con'd bus as it is cheap (HK$6.3), from Kowloon to Taipo, New Territories. However there only 2 non-air con'd bus running on Rt. 72, so u need to know the timetable of the buses in order not to wait for a long time.</p>

              <p>I also recomment to take Rt. 15 from the peak to central, U better take tram from The Peak (Lower
                                          Terminus) in central to the peak, and then take NWFB Rt. 15 back to central as it is very exciting ( narrow road with fast speed ).</p>
              <p>Also i recomment NWFB H1, and H2 open top sightseeing bus, HK$50 for whole day and HK$8.9 for a trip</p>

              <p><br>Earliest flight out from SIN is at 0650H - United 896. Jetstar leaves slightly after 0700H. Though online booking you will realise though 3K is a budget carrier, its more expensive than UA sometimes. That's why my preference is UA.</p>
              <p>This duo are also the last flights into SIN at night. If they are early its 2320H and they can land as late as 2355H.</p>
              <p>No CX or SQ beat this combination so since their charges are generally more expensive, its still UA. hahaa.</p>

              <p>I will just comment on the aviation side, since you asked in the question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SQ now has 6x daily flights to HKG, all nonstop.</p>
              <p><strong>6th Daily eff 27MAY10</strong><br> SQ860 SIN0830 – 1215HKG 77W D<br> SQ856 SIN0945 – 1330HKG 388 D<br> SQ866 SIN1330 – 1715HKG 772 D<br> <strong>SQ872 SIN1505 – 1850HKG 772 D</strong><br> SQ002 SIN1750 – 2135HKG 77W D<br> SQ870 SIN1900 – 2245HKG 772 D</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>SQ872 and return SQ871 are the new 6th daily. Given a choice, if you want to arrive into HKG to maximise your full day, take SQ860. You'll arrive into HKG just in time for lunch, and two meals will be served onboard, compared to later flights which most likely would be just a single meal(probably additional snack service). The 77W has better seats as well, if you don't mind the drony GE90 engines. Seating config for all 77W and 772 flights are 3-3-3. For the 388, it is 3-4-3 on the lower deck and 2-4-2 on the upper deck. On your return, do avoid SQ1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cathay Pacific, now has a 6th daily nonstop flight to HKG from 1st August 2010. Currently operating 4x weekly.</p>
              <p>All in all, CX operates 46x weekly to HKG. You should be able to find one that matches your schedule best. Please please, avoid the particular flight that goes via BKK Bangkok. You wouldn't want such a longwinded routing. That should be the CX712/713 pair.<br><br><br><img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/3715/picture5ra.png" alt=""></p>

              <p>Try to avoid the 330s. They send their older nonrefurb 773s and 330s regionally.</p>
              <p>Their supposed 6th daily is below.</p>

              <p>Operating aircraft varies from 01JUL10, and increasing to Daily from 
              01AUG10. However, the arrival time in HKG is just way to late for local transport connections.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jetstar operates twice daily to HKG, and three times daily on Fridays and Sundays.</p>

              <p>3K693/694 is the one that operates on Fri and Sun. Rest operate daily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tiger Airways from 01FEB10 launches 13 weekly <strong>Singapore – Hong

Go and find out the prices from a few sources before making the decision.  <br>Australia different. <br><br>Yung Kee Roasted Duck. Can go online and find it out yourself. Its near Lan Kwai Fung.</p>

              <p>Ic. That time I went to buy a tram set at HKD 298... went over to the star ferry terminal, it costs HKD 328. An extra HKD 30, equivalent to about SGD 5+ difference.</p>

              <p><br>Earliest flight out from SIN is at 0650H - United 896. Jetstar leaves slightly after 0700H. Though online booking you will realise though 3K is a budget carrier, its more expensive than UA sometimes. That's why my preference is UA.</p>
              <p>This duo are also the last flights into SIN at night. If they are early its 2320H and they can land as late as 2355H.</p>
              <p>No CX or SQ beat this combination so since their charges are generally more expensive, its still UA. hahaa.</p>

              <p>Please do not book UA. I've heard rumours about it that with the merger with Continental, the HKG-SIN tag-on from Chicago might be axed. While it is true that you would probably be compensated and given an option on another flight, it is cumbersome and having personally experienced that, it is a heck lot of replanning and paperwork.</p>
