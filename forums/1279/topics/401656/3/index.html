              <p>i dun usally ask for timing because i prefer to camp and hunt and get the results myself rather than rely and cheat using timings. its juz the way I bus spot. </p>
              <p>=D</p>
              <p>I am not talking about timing of a certain bus, but e.g. 10:00-12:00 Boon Lay then I should allow 1 hour if my next destination is Tai Seng, plus the best mode of transportation (bus, train or even taxi).</p>
              <p>------</p>
              <p>Un Long was the old spelling and Yuen Long is the newer spelling of the district.</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Indeed, intrrestingly on thr tram thing, most bus guides dun even show tram baording stations. My HK Atalas shows it as well.. woopee. NB: the 2006 edition i have does not show tram stations..chui.</p>
              <p>I cannot even remember those stations although I know where the track goes.</p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>yes confusing as it is, most bus service suffix dun even follow the set rules. due to lots of rotue amendment and "strengthening of bus services". Dun assume a P service is just a few hours only or an S service is just mornin gpeak premium. I think cna list one of them KMB 275P for example. or is it the  KMb 275S. it ops to the Hong Kong NIE and is similair to our 1789 vs 179A idea.</p>
              <p>When somebody visited the territory several months ago, I told him to regard 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F on Kowloon side as 7 separate routes and not to think about the relationship, although there may be some, but it is not necessarily be. Otherwise, you will get crazy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fares:</p>
              <p>With STEP fares,</p>
              <p>The correct name we use here should be "sectional" fare.</p>
              <p>for a general guide one shd always try to take the end part of a bus route or the full, route.</p>
              <p>Apply to most routes, but not all. Some have dual way sectional fares.</p>
              <p>never take a CHS for part of the route, always cross the harbor  with it.</p>
              <p>But you may take after crossing harbour. These "international" routes are sometimes cheaper than the "domestic" route in some cases.</p>
              <p>---------</p>
              <p>Airport svcs with beginnning with "A" are using Stonecutters bridge beginning this week...</p>
              <p>It just applies to some citybus A routes. Long Win ones do not use.</p>
              <p>It happened for months.</p>
              <p>From Kowloon, HK island, you will be able to see the KMB Jubilants training buses [3 buses in white livery] near the Hong Kong United Dockyard at Cheung Tsing Highway[u have to look down] before the bus turns to Tsing Ma Highway.</p>
              <p>I doubt so. No Jubilant training bus should be kept in Tsing Yi Depot.</p>
              <p>Also before the bus turns to Tsing Ma Highway, you can have a glimpse of a totally red[prob from rust] KMB Jubilant with words marked "Training"</p>
              <p>Victory 2 instead.</p>

              <p>well i use STEP cause its essentially the same as our bus system  STEP fares in 1980s. just my way of being nostalgic u'know.</p>
              <p>And yeah i should expect the fares of the CHS on Hk island to be cheaper than some of the other operators with duplicate servings.</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>More Dennis trdients on Hk island?</p>
              <p>not sure about that. I know most of the NWFB DTs like it at TKO and the CTB tridents , well they like the Airport Express or their "CBS" B3 / B3X. </p>
              <p>i'll go have a sniff about while I;m there....</p>

              <p>i dun usally ask for timing because i prefer to camp and hunt
              and get the results myself rather than rely and cheat using
              timings. its juz the way I bus spot. </p>
              <p>=D</p>
              <p>I am not talking about timing of a certain bus, but e.g.
              10:00-12:00 Boon Lay then I should allow 1 hour if my next
              destination is Tai Seng, plus the best mode of transportation (bus,
              train or even taxi).</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">oooh yes limits of your waits and time taken to travel between points.</span></p>
              <p>------</p>
              <p>Un Long was the old spelling and Yuen Long is the newer spelling
              of the district.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I see.</span></p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Indeed, intrrestingly on thr tram thing, most bus guides dun
              even show tram baording stations. My HK Atalas shows it as well..
              woopee. NB: the 2006 edition i have does not show tram
              stations..chui.</p>
              <p>I cannot even remember those stations although I know where the
              track goes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">well, its does help if u know where the tram stop is....I know cuz i had a fun time looking for one few years back...u know walking alg the track...lol</span></p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>yes confusing as it is, most bus service suffix dun even follow
              the set rules. due to lots of rotue amendment and "strengthening of
              bus services". Dun assume a P service is just a few hours only or
              an S service is just mornin gpeak premium. I think cna list one of
              them KMB 275P for example. or is it the  KMb 275S. it ops
              to the Hong Kong NIE and is similair to our 1789 vs 179A idea.</p>
              <p>When somebody visited the territory several months ago, I told
              him to regard 2, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F on Kowloon side as
              7 separate routes and not to think about the relationship, although
              there may be some, but it is not necessarily be. Otherwise, you
              will get crazy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">yeah well not to mention  about the KMB 6 series..hahaha 6A 6C 6F the lot...They dun generally serve the same area but only a few of them are based on the other...</span></p>
              <p>Fares:</p>
              <p>With STEP fares,</p>
              <p>The correct name we use here should be "sectional" fare.</p>
              <p>for a general guide one shd always try to take the end part of a
              bus route or the full, route.</p>
              <p>Apply to most routes, but not all. Some have dual way sectional
              fares. <span style="color: #ff0000;">(ah hmm din know that..</span></p>
              <p>never take a CHS for part of the route, always cross the harbor
               with it.</p>
              <p>But you may take after crossing harbour. These "international"
              routes are sometimes cheaper than the "domestic" route in some
              cases.</p>
              <p>---------</p>
              <p>Airport svcs with beginnning with "A" are using Stonecutters
              bridge beginning this week...</p>
              <p>It just applies to some citybus A routes. Long Win ones do not
              use.</p>
              <p>It happened for months.</p>
              <p>From Kowloon, HK island, you will be able to see the KMB
              Jubilants training buses [3 buses in white livery] near the Hong
              Kong United Dockyard at Cheung Tsing Highway[u have to look
              down] before the bus turns to Tsing Ma Highway.</p>
              <p>I doubt so. No Jubilant training bus should be kept in Tsing Yi
              Depot.</p>
              <p>Also before the bus turns to Tsing Ma Highway, you can have a
              glimpse of a totally red[prob from rust] KMB Jubilant with words
              marked "Training"</p>
              <p>Victory 2 instead.</p>

              6X but duh lately my min'd fixed on 260. The 6 and 6X confuse me.
              They seem to indicate some extra route into a bay area after
              leaving Stanley after night. </p>
              <p>anyways CTb 260's its got a certain &lt;=10m DD on it

              <p>I see. Give it a try when u get to, its pretty fun (6 and 6X) due to the bouncyness of the dragons and road condition. Well, if u are certain to take 260 to try the 2xadd, do make use of transfer rebates (yes there is rebates) if possible, because if u transfer from 260 to A11 or A12, the 260 fare is foc. A little tedious to do that though.</p>
              <p>Also, to make use of the "dual way" sectional fares, its actually the same as sg. Tap in and tap out, only difference being u can only tap out at the entrance reader.</p>

              <p><br>For Citybus and NWFB, yes. For KMB, no.</p>
              <p>Some routes like 53 64K and 76K offer dual way sectional fares. KMB did not set the "rebate" system. Therefore, you have to pay cash for a certain section and tell the driver that you are doing so.</p>

              <p>Some good news for muslim bus fans who love HK buses and wish to visit HK; I spotted some muslims who are staying there and I even found a mosque at Tsim Sha Tsui. So I believe you all are able to find Halal food there, if you all wish to visit HK one day.</p>
