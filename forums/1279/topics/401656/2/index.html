              <p>For the star ferry.....there are 2 routes that i recomment: <span>Central to Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry &amp; </span><span>Wan Chai to </span><span>Tsim Sha Tsui </span><span>Star Ferry. If u want to take photo or video, i highly recomment u sit at lower deck, as there are no windows at the front, however there is no air-cond. (PS. </span><span>ferry travel from Wan Chai to </span><span>Tsim Sha Tsui </span><span>Star Ferry only open the lower deck at peak hour)<br></span></p>

              <p>btw, what is the bus route to Victoria Peak? I think must be very interesting to travel all way uphill and later downhill?</p>
              <p>For the Star ferry services, I remembered travelling on a similar old double-deck ferry by PSA from Kusu Island back to Clifford Pier when I was very young, probably the 80s. I suspect that ferry was imported 2nd hand from HK. The seawater can get into the lower deck while travelling at midsea. How about HK ones? I also noticed in the YouTube from Basiling in the earlier post the HK Star ferry seemed to travel at rather fast speed!</p>

              <p><br>You may buy a bus guide from KMB. But it is ifamous for ERRORS.</p>
              <p>You may collect pamphlets at MTR service centres.</p>
              <p>You may find a demobilised Atlantean at Tung Chung Citybus bus park as noise barrier.</p>
              <p>It is still relatively cheap and worth to take Star Ferry, although the price has risen for two times in 1.5 years. All routes except the expensive tour are recommended. Just take one of them would do.</p>

              <p>To Victoria Peak, take NWFB15 from Central. Alternatively can also take NWFB15B from Causeway Bay.</p>
              <p>My recommendation would be to take 6 from Central, it plies via Repulse bay to Stanley Market thru some pretty narrow and steep roads. Something similar to 15 just that it dosent go that high, but the journey time is longer and more scenery to see.</p>
              <p>On the way back, Try either the minibus 40 to Causeway Bay or NWFB14 to Shau Kei Wan. The minibus will bring u back via Repulse bay, Deep water bay, Ocean park enterance, and aberdeen tunnel. While the 14 will bring u to another route via the Tai Tam Dam. (It brings u ontop of the dam and crosses it) Pretty nice view i would say.</p>
              <p>If u still have time, also can try Svc 9 to Shek O, but i would say its not really a tourist hotspot so its really just for sightseeing on your own.</p>

              <p>6, 6X and 260 are daytime services and ply different routes towards stanley market/prison from central. 6A is a peak hour service. Fastest route would definately be 260, and if u are lucky, can get to try the E400 too.. 6 would give a good view and an exciting trip especially if u are sitting at the front.</p>
              <p>If u are going to Stanley from Ocean park, take 73 and 973 from ocean park's main entrance (have to walk out to the main road). Otherwise if u plan to visit stanley first (which i dont recommand coz its nice to spend a full day at ocean park) then u can only take 73 from stanley as 973 would charge u cross harbour fares.</p>

              <p><strong>hong Kong tours?!</strong></p>
              <p>Well you want to plan a tour in hong Kong right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do u have in mind:</p>
              <p>1) Tour tour tour sights and place of interest?</p>
              <p>2) Spot bus</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think everyone above has pretty much covered item no 1. Mostly research for whad bus to go say ocean park la, Peak la Star ferry la already can find on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">internet</span>.</p>
              <p>one thing missed out is the open top Dennis Condor on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NWFB 15C</span>. can take that to peak tram lower station if u prefer. then take peak tram up to Peak.</p>
              <p>To add on abt Chinese tourings , yes they create a mess of shouting n crowding. Even at the Wan Chai Exhibition  flower area. Do stay clear of The peak on weekends fri evening n sat n sun. To avoid crowd.</p>
              <p>Dun forget to catch the lazer light show at Star ferry Kowloon side. 8pm on all days. show was featured in &lt;&lt;Flash Forward&gt;&gt;. (hahaha)</p>

              <p><strong>hong Kong tours?!</strong></p>
              <p>U can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read maps</span> and u know what is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">google map</span>. pro. So good ah? Ok u are ready to plan a bus tour in HK.</p>
              <p>first u need to research out the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus routes</span> (in general lah) and their district patterns. Bus routes cna be found on the bus operators websites. KMB website got maps!</p>
              <p>then u find out about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus models</span>. then how to optimise the bus system using  their STEP fare system.</p>
              <p>Uze <a href="http://www.1005.idv.hk/index.php?page=11&amp;p=291"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.1005.idv.hk/index.php?page=11&amp;p=291</span></span></a> as a nice website to follow bus deplpyments.</p>
              <p>After that u decide first, you want to spot some bus models to try&gt;??? or you want to joyride bus routes (like some suggested in earlier posts)?  List down what you want to joyride bus route or what bus photots u want or what bus models u wanna ride on.</p>
              <p>ok great. you are ready to plan.</p>
              <p>you need a decent bus guide from hong Kong. not jsut any lousy one listing bus rotues only. u need well detailed maps.</p>
              <p>The book must contain the following</p>
              <p>1) Bus routes from all operators including minibus<br>2) Bus stop names. these are important as bus stops in Hong Kong are always staggered type. u wun find all your bus routes at one bus stop pole. another bus stop pole might be 100m nearby obnly</p>
              <p> 3) Listing of bus route an prciing of the STEP fare.</p>
              <p>4) most improtant thing maps . u need the book also to walk around using the detialed maps.</p>
              <p>sadly the KMB bus guide cannot offer the above. So what i propsoe is the</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOng Kong Bus Atlas (HK$ 9</span>8) low in stock in major book stores and some say 7-11.</p>
              <p>Only problem is, the route detials are in Chinese . In this case you will find the NWFB/CTB and KMB bus websites useful for transalations. Also the maps on KMB blow up to bigger size and u can plan in more detials.</p>
              <p>Sadly the NWFB and CTB website does not show out in map form.</p>
              <p>for MTRbus and NLB, the book is reliable enough in Chiense chracters. There are english words on the map so its OK.</p>
              <p>lets go thru an example...</p>
              <p>EXAMPLE</p>
              <p>You wish to walk the mid levles escalators and yet take a trident on CTB 13 at Caine Rd (Dr Sun yat Sen Villa) .</p>
              <p>planning:</p>
              <p>Internet research shows pcitures of how this mid levels escalators look like,. Using google maps, u can roughly find the start point. Its opposite some Central market building along Queens Rd. U trace the route out on &lt;Hong Kong Bus Atlas&gt;. u note the walking path to Caine Rd.</p>
              <p>At Caine Rd u find a bus stop listing bus 13. that is the bus stop u wait for 13 to try Dennis trident.</p>
              <p>EXAMPLE (DISTRICT PLANNING - West side towns)</p>
              <p>You want to ride Enviro 200 and yet also want to ride Noeplan Centroliner and the ASU series of bus.U realsie all are found in Nothern territories. west side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u know they have a Nam Cheong Day pass for HK$20 for unlimited rides on West Line MTR, LRT and the MTRBus feeder services up west there.</p>
              <p>planning:</p>
              <p>using <a href="http://www.1005.idv.hk/index.php?page=11&amp;p=291"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.1005.idv.hk/index.php?page=11&amp;p=291</span></span></a> you note that there is ASU on 60X and 69X and also neoplan centroliner on 60X. Also u reckon 268C is a nice route to try to go ride. Internet youtube searches say that Enviro 200 Dart can be found on A73, K68 and K75.</p>
              <p>next step find out where these bus routes go. piece them up like a jigsaw.</p>
              <p>Example -</p>
              <p>campe at Ntahn rd for 60X or 69X ASU if cannot wait so long, hop on any 60X Neoplan Centorliner. u neeed to cater for a back up plan. that is later how are u gonna spot the ASU or Neoplan that u missed.  Some though clearly indicates u have two chances of Neoplan on a possible route so u shd really camp it out for a ASU on 60X or 69X.</p>
              <p>U end up at teun Mun lets say on a 60X. Alright MTR station go control offwick buy the day pass for west area.</p>
              <p>u realise its over peak hours. drat. A73 runs only during peak hours and it has Enviro 200. how how how...</p>
              <p>U know K75 ends at Tin Shui Wai or TSW. using the free pass, take the MTR down to TSW. campe for K74. take the bus round to its end pt. there got LRT. ok good can try LRT. take to Yuen Long. using the map can find the 269C bus int.</p>
              <p>269C layover at this open int . good cna see what is the enxt bus of 269C. its a neoplan woopee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>end-</p>
              <p>er.. note of coruse with the Nam Cheong-Tuen Mun Day pass, we highly suggest u spend the entire day riding LRT or spotting other MTRBus services uopp west there.</p>
              <p>Happy planning</p>
              <p>ZYX</p>

              <p><em>ok great. you are ready to plan.</em></p>
              <p><em>you need a decent bus guide from hong Kong. not jsut any lousy one listing bus rotues only. u need well detailed maps.</em></p>

              <p><em>1) Bus routes from all operators including minibus<br>2) Bus stop names. these are important as bus stops in Hong Kong are always staggered type. u wun find all your bus routes at one bus stop pole. another bus stop pole might be 100m nearby obnly</em></p>
              <p><em> 3) Listing of bus route an prciing of the STEP fare.</em></p>
              <p><em>4) most improtant thing maps . u need the book also to walk around using the detialed maps.</em></p>

              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOng Kong Bus Atlas (HK$ 9</span>8) low in stock in major book stores and some say 7-11.</em></p>
              <p><em>Only problem is, the route detials are in Chinese . In this case you will find the NWFB/CTB and KMB bus websites useful for transalations. Also the maps on KMB blow up to bigger size and u can plan in more detials.</em></p>
              <p><em>Sadly the NWFB and CTB website does not show out in map form.</em></p>
              <p><em>for MTRbus and NLB, the book is reliable enough in Chiense chracters. There are english words on the map so its OK.</em></p>
              <p><em>lets go thru an example...</em></p>
              <p><em>EXAMPLE</em></p>
              <p><em>You wish to walk the mid levles escalators and yet take a trident on CTB 13 at Caine Rd (Dr Sun yat Sen Villa) .</em></p>
              <p><em>planning:</em></p>
              <p><em>Internet research shows pcitures of how this mid levels escalators look like,. Using google maps, u can roughly find the start point.

              <p><em>At Caine Rd u find a bus stop listing bus 13. that is the bus stop u wait for 13 to try Dennis trident.</em></p>
              <p><em>EXAMPLE (DISTRICT PLANNING - West side towns)</em></p>
              <p><em>You want to ride Enviro 200 and yet also want to ride Noeplan Centroliner and the ASU series of bus.U realsie all are found in Nothern territories. west side.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>u know they have a Nam Cheong Day pass for HK$20 for unlimited rides on West Line MTR, LRT and the MTRBus feeder services up west there.</em></p>
              <p><em>planning:</em></p>

              <p><em>next step find out where these bus routes go. piece them up like a jigsaw.</em></p>
              <p><em>Example -</em></p>
              <p><em>campe at Ntahn rd for 60X or 69X ASU if cannot wait so long, hop on any 60X Neoplan Centorliner. u neeed to cater for a back up plan. that is later how are u gonna spot the ASU or Neoplan that u missed.  Some though clearly indicates u have two chances of Neoplan on a possible route so u shd really camp it out for a ASU on 60X or 69X.</em></p>
              <p><em>U end up at teun Mun lets say on a 60X. Alright MTR station go control offwick buy the day pass for west area.</em></p>
              <p><em>u realise its over peak hours. drat. A73 runs only during peak hours and it has Enviro 200. how how how...</em></p>
              <p><em>U know K75 ends at Tin Shui Wai or TSW. using the free pass, take the MTR down to TSW. campe for K74. take the bus round to its end pt. there got LRT. ok good can try LRT. take to Yuen Long. using the map can find the 269C bus int.</em></p>
              <p><em>269C layover at this open int . good cna see what is the enxt bus of 269C. its a neoplan woopee.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>end-</em></p>
              <p><em>er.. note of coruse with the Nam Cheong-Tuen Mun Day pass, we highly suggest u spend the entire day riding LRT or spotting other MTRBus services uopp west there.</em></p>
              <p><em>Happy planning</em></p>

              <p>The transport guide should also include tram, MTR... You also need to compare the fare, the distance and the operation period. A bus guide ("Bashi Guido" in Japanese :D )should be a person instead as I am not contented in any book / website currently offering if you are going for bus spotting.</p>
              <p>Not 100m, but 10m.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong Route 13 is operated by NWFB instead.</p>
              <p>U means "Un Long" (Yuen Long) depot. But not necessarily be all buses in NT West. The "U" in ASU does not have this meaning.</p>
              <p>What ZYX does in HK is just like what I usually do in SG. But I would ask some local people as I plan my trip, with time and places for confirmation.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Pls note on HK Island, even with a suffix X, it does not mean the bus services on HK Main island itself are express. i got fooled once before.</em></p>
              <p><em>On Kowloon however, X services charge higher fares but are real express.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think you must have taken the slow part of 5X, 8X or X962.</p>
              <p>"X" in Hong Kong / Kowloon / NT would somehow refer to an express route from one district to another, but it usually is circuituous within the area. e.g. Observe many parts of Boon Lay and Express through AYE and observe many parts of Bukit Merah. I think this can give you a better idea.</p>

              <p>S1 bus stop is under the departure area. It does not serve GTC. You can take the bus opposite to GTC on the slip road.</p>

              <p>Lol. i never say anything about express? Never even use the word

              <p>Its true that in Hk island there's no standard of defining

              mostly services that brings u around faster via the Island Eastern

              <p>i dun usally ask for timing because i prefer to camp and hunt and get the results myself rather than rely and cheat using timings. its juz the way I bus spot. </p>
              <p>=D</p>
              <p>------</p>
              <p>Er i am clearly aware that the U with cricle is bus belong to Un Long but i prefer to say Yuen Long.l Sorrie Singaporean Chiense. i mean seriuosly here,  the Yuen is spell as Yuen not Un...lol</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>Indeed, intrrestingly on thr tram thing, most bus guides dun even show tram baording stations. My HK Atalas shows it as well.. woopee. NB: the 2006 edition i have does not show tram stations..chui.</p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>Indeed a person on the local ground will know much more. On the other hand, A bus spotting session can  still be done and be successful with the reliable info on the ent and a good bus book.</p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>yes confusing as it is, most bus service suffix dun even follow the set rules. due to lots of rotue amendment and "strengthening of bus services". Dun assume a P service is just a few hours only or an S service is just mornin gpeak premium. I think cna list one of them KMB 275P for example. or is it the  KMb 275S. it ops to the Hong Kong NIE and is similair to our 1789 vs 179A idea.</p>
              <p>Fares:</p>
              <p>With STEP fares, for a general guide one shd always try to take the end part of a bus route or the full, route. that way u are safe from expensive fares. never take a CHS for part of the route, always cross the harbor  with it.  Pay more on some X routes, but beware of cheaper alternatives. </p>
              <p>if possible always find the chance to do a BBI, that way u get a free or discounted ride on 2nd leg. be sure to trf at the right bus stop and use ur Octopus (Paul??)loll card .</p>
