              <p><strong>SMRT sacks 3 drivers allegedly involved in Nov strike</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: SMRT has terminated the services of three bus drivers
               who are facing criminal charges for their alleged roles in a strike 
              last November - for absence from work without valid reasons.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>It said  He Jun Ling, Gao Yue Qiang and Liu Xiang Ying breached the terms of their employment contracts.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The contract of a fourth driver, Wang Xianjie, who had also been charged and had not reported for work, expired on 14 January.<br><br>He is no longer employed by SMRT.  <br><br>SMRT
               said in a statement on Wednesday that the four drivers had not reported
               for work since they were released on bail on 6 December 2012.<br><br>In the past six weeks, it had actively sought to maintain contact with them. <br><br>They had, until recently, refused direct communication with SMRT even though they were still employed and paid by SMRT.<br><br>They also moved out of the accommodation provided by the company and rejected SMRT's offers of alternate accommodation.<br> <br>SMRT
               said their continued absence from work without official leave is a 
              breach of the company's policy, as well as the terms of their employment
               contracts.<br><br>It suspended them from their duties, pending an internal disciplinary inquiry.<br><br>Notices of the inquiry were sent to their lawyers.<br> <br>The inquiry was held on 17 January for He, Gao and Liu but the three were absent.<br><br>After
               considering the facts and evidence, the SMRT disciplinary board found 
              that the three were absent from work without prior leave or reasonable 
              explanation.<br><br>They also failed to inform or attempt to inform SMRT of the reasons for their absence.<br><br>- CNA/xq</span></span></p>

According to He and Liu himself, the latter was slapped many times by his interrogators.<br><br>“He (the interrogation officer) said, ‘Do you know I can dig a hole and bury you? No one will be able to find you.’ Those were the police’s actual words,” he said. In another instance, Liu said the officer told him “I have ways to make you confess”.<br><br>“I said, what do you want me to confess? All I’m saying is what I did on the 26th (the day the strike occurred) and who I talked to, because he was asking me about the 26th and I told them who was present then. He didn’t believe me,” he added.<br><br>Liu also said he was asked if he knew He, and when he said he did not, he was slapped repeatedly on the left side, behind his neck and shoulder blades.<br><br>“I said I don’t know him (He). Because I didn’t know He Jun Ling he beat me. He said ‘You know him!’; I said, ‘I don’t’, and then he hit me,” he said. “He hit me hard. If he wasn’t using a lot of force, He Jun Ling wouldn’t have heard it.”<br><br>Lee, who spoke to all four of the drivers as part of research she was doing for a documentary, said in a blog post on her website that she felt compelled to share the clips from the interviews she did with He and Liu, as they are “serious allegations that need to be addressed urgently”.<br><br>Speaking to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> on Tuesday morning, she said she had written to the <a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AqH7ngJUIr2KBPRWYLINllQBV8d_;_ylu=X3oDMTFqY2dxYjVxBG1pdANBcnRpY2xlIEJvZHkEcG9zAzYEc2VjA01lZGlhQXJ0aWNsZUJvZHlBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTJzZDAyaGx1BGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDM2EyZTUwNDMtYTJiMi0zYWY3LThhNTEtNzliYmY5MmYyNjZhBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdl;_ylv=0/SIG=126lo13c9/EXP=1360739760/**http%3A//www.prisons.gov.sg/content/sps/default.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Singapore Prison Service</span></span></a>, seeking a response to the drivers’ allegations, but had yet to hear back from them.<br><br>“I think everyone will agree that it is unacceptable for the police to hit anyone,” she said, adding that she had reason to believe that they were not lying because they were interviewed separately, at different times, and were not present at each other’s interviews.<br><br>“I hope the relevant authorities will respond,” she said. “It will be good to hear from them.”<br><br>When contacted for comment, a police spokesperson acknowledged the seriousness of the accusations He and Liu had made.<br><br>“They should file a police report so that we can investigate into them. Their lawyers can also raise this matter in court when the case against them is heard,” she said.<br><br>Lawyers acting for He have not yet said whether they plan to contest the voluntariness of the drivers' statements given in court, should they go to trial. <br><br>The four are next expected in court for a pre-trial conference on Friday afternoon.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>read the above very loal cheena news in their backyard. got video proof of what happening.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>their road marking systems and constuction is lazy and  cheena style inadequete. i am glad our sg ones instead ofdrawing lines, we have conrete island on our roads. in this way drivers will be more aware and cautious of borders as not to hit curbs while if youhave lines painted cars can easily just go over them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the video clearly the motorist  crossed the line by being kiasu to stop his machine right at the zebra crossings. see for your sleve how fuckup teh coctry is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also the container truck - i wonder who rig the container or how its assembled, like that only will overturn. or the speed at which the tow truck is making the ttrun is really high?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from what i see the road may just not be wide enough, good for small cars, but not good for bigger vehicles. driver also have to judge the road width and conditioins before deciding on a spedd to make a sharp turn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FUCK up conuntry it is!</p>

              drivers from China, who are accused of instigating an illegal strike in 
              November last year.</span></span></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The dates are for the first tranche of trial. <br><br>This was revealed on Friday after a closed-door session at the Subordinate Courts.<br><br>Lawyer Peter Low, who represents He, told reporters after the session that they were "ready to go for trial".<br><br>Mr Low said there will be another closed-door session on February 22.<br><br>The session is meant to check lawyers' progress for trial, and is unlikely to affect the trial dates.<br><br>Defence lawyers did not say how many witnesses will be called to the trial.<br><br>But
               Andrew Goh, who represents Liu, said one of the likely defence 
              witnesses would be the doctor who issued medical certificates to some 
              drivers on November 27 - the day after the illegal strike. <br><br>Meanwhile, lawyers are still translating some 200 pages of documents in Mandarin.<br><br>These are messages posted by about 100 SMRT drivers on a Chinese social networking portal called QQ.<br><br>Mr
               Goh cannot confirm if the documents will be used as evidence in court. 
              But he added that they can suggest the kind of involvement each 
              ex-driver had, as the drivers' "sentiments were all ventilated" on QQ.<br><br>Lawyers have also offered the documents to the prosecution.<br><br>The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said the prosecution will be reviewing these documents.<br><br>An
               AGC spokesperson also said the prosecution will be calling more than 30
               witnesses, including SMRT officials, bus drivers and police officers. <br><br>The
               spokesperson also addressed the issue of a filmmaker, whose laptop and 
              mobile phone were seized by the police for investigation.<br><br>The 
              filmmaker, Lynn Lee, had shot videos of He and Liu, who claimed they 
              were abused while they were held for questioning in November last year.<br><br>The AGC said the film and abuse allegations are separate issues from the trial.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <p><strong> Ex-SMRT bus drivers charged with instigating strike will plead guilty</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>By Jermyn Chow</em></p>
              <p>The four alleged ringleaders of last November's illegal bus strike will plead guilty to charges of instigating the protest, just two weeks after claiming trial.</p>
              <p>Gao Yue Qiang, 32, Liu Xiangying, 33, Wang Xianjie, 39, and He Jun Ling, 32, decided this after their lawyers met with prosecutors in chambers on Friday. The four men will plead guilty on Monday at the Subordinate Court.</p>
              <p>The offence carry the maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2, 000 fine.</p>
              <p>The four are among 171 drivers from China who took part in the strike on Nov 26 and the 88 who stayed away again the following day. They were protesting over pay and living conditions.</p>

              <p>Police should also press investoagtiotn on one of them who claim he has been torued ill treated during incestigation wih police. dont worry SPF. if you officers in charge of the case then really knew they themslevs dinot do such a thing, please help to press this case forward to claim for your own clean and rights and fight for the turth. these cheenaland nationals are very good liars. i find the repot and their claims and staement very cheenalnd like - not likely what a SPF officer will say or threaten.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in addition i think APF also owe the public and media a clarification and conculsion on this claim by the cheena national. if really got officers behaor like tta, tehy should be dealt with. however, if the cheena was trying his luck to be funny, addtional charges and sentecnes or canning shouldbe passed - giving false accusations and sattemnt on polcie officers</p>
