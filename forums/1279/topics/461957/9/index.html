              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">They gathered beneath their dormitory in Woodlands and refused to go to work.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported yesterday that the mainland Chinese bus drivers demanded that they be given equal pay.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Among the protesters was Mr He, 40, who told Shin Min Daily News that they were unhappy because Malaysian drivers received a $275 increment and a month's bonus recently.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">In contrast, Chinese nationals were given only an extra $75, without any bonus.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Mr He said that a few bus drivers gathered below the dormitory at 3.30am yesterday and persuaded other drivers not to go to work.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">By 8am, a sizeable number of bus drivers in their uniforms had congregated, he said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">At about 9.30am, an SMRT human-resource (HR) executive and an SMRT staff member in charge of Woodlands Bus Interchange arrived to resolve the dispute.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">However, when discussions came to a standstill, police officers in riot vans were called in to maintain order.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Afraid that they would be arrested for gathering illegally, the bus drivers eventually returned to their dormitory rooms.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The police told My Paper that they received a call about the protest at about 10am.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said its labour-relations officers were at the Woodlands dormitory to work with the drivers and SMRT on their dispute.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">A MOM spokesman said talks between SMRT management and the workers began yesterday afternoon and ended in the evening.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">"MOM takes the workers' actions very seriously. There are appropriate grievance-handling processes in place, and workers are advised to speak to their HR and management to discuss and resolve any employment-related issues amicably, rather than take matters into their own hands," the spokesman said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.35em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">An SMRT spokesman said that drivers who were not rostered to work yesterday were requested to work as a result of the no-show by the 102 drivers, who will return to work today.</p>

The change meant less opportunity to earn overtime pay, the Chinese-language Lianhe Zaobao newspaper reported on its website.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Helvetica, sans-serif, ï¿½sï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">Pictures published by Shin Min Daily News, another Chinese-language paper, showed drivers gathered on the grounds of a dormitory where they live, with policemen and vehicles belonging to riot police around the premises.</p>

The last major strike was in 1986 by shipyard workers.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Helvetica, sans-serif, ï¿½sï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">Lianhe Wanbao quoted a driver saying he now got about SG$1,400 (US$1,100) a month, down from more than SG$2,000 a month when he could earn more by working on days off. The Chinese drivers were also unhappy about being paid less than drivers from Singapore and Malaysia, it said.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, 'Times New Roman', Helvetica, sans-serif, ï¿½sï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, ï¿½Ó©ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 19.799999237060547px;">A spokesman for SMRT declined to comment, saying the company was drafting a statement. State broadcaster Channel NewsAsia quoted the firm saying that talks were being held with the drivers.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In a rare case of industrial action in Singapore, they refused to board a shuttle that was going to ferry them from their dormitory to a nearby depot. </span></strong>After talks with management - with police on standby - the drivers said they would report for work today. SMRT is 54 percent owned by state investment firm Temasek Holdings. Singapore has been hiring bus drivers from China and Malaysia because of a chronic shortage of manpower.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One of the strikers said the dispute arose because they felt aggrieved over a disparity in pay between Chinese and Malaysian bus drivers. </span></strong>Those from China earn a basic salary of S$1,075 (HK$6,814), while those from Malaysia earn S$1,375, the driver said. The dispute was also about the lack of bonuses for Chinese bus drivers.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower sternly warned the 102 drivers who took part in the stoppage, saying it "takes the workers' actions very seriously" and was closely monitoring the situation.</p>
              <p> The National Transport Workers' Union urged the drivers - who are not union members - to return to work immediately.</p>
              <p>No major disruptions were reported during the work stoppage, which took place during Singapore's year-end school holidays, when demand for public transport is lower.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">The Hock Lee bus strike began peacefully on 23 April 1955 but escalated into a violent riot on 12 May in which four people were killed and 31 injured. During the strike, large numbers of dismissed bus workers locked themselves in the Hock Lee garages at Alexandra Road and picketed at the gates. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">On 10 May, the pickets rioted when they were forcibly removed by the police. On 12 May, they were joined by several lorry loads of Chinese school students and the violence that followed led to the death of two police officers, a journalist and a student. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #444444; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px;">On 13 May, the government closed three Chinese schools for a week and ordered the expulsion of some of the ringleaders. On 14 May, the Hock Lee bus strike was settled by government arbitration on terms generally favourable to the strikers.</span></p>

              <div>In 1955 Lim had been elected as Singapore's youngest parliamentarian. However, a year later, after widespread riots involving industrial workers and Chinese school students, he was arrested and imprisoned on charges of being one of the leaders of the "communist united front" alleged to have been behind the riots.
              <p> </p>
              Lim's own reputation was a further casualty to the riots' mayhem and bloodshed, and he was detained without trial. He denied charges that he was a communist, charges which remain unsubstantiated until today.
              <p> </p>
              In a startling and revisionist essay, Dr Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths University observes that the British Governor of Singapore and his Chief Secretary in their reports to London had admitted that the police could find no evidence to establish that Lim was a communist.
              <p> </p>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Poulgrain claims it was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, who had deliberately "provoked" the bus and other industrial workers and Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in order to have Lim Chin Siong arrested. </span></strong>
              <p> </p>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Lim Yew Hock's own admission to responsibility for the riot appears in an official report to the British Government</span></strong> which Poulgrain found in the Colonial Office records in London which are now open to researchers.
              <p> </p>
              <div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock," </span></span></strong>adds Poulgrain, "in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">making it illegal for former political detainees to stand for election."</span></strong></div>
