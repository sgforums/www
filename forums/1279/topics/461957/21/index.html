              <p>Since they are bus driver, it is better to provide them enough rest so that they do not endanger the safety of themselves and the passengers.</p>
              <p>To your second query, sad to inform you that you have high expectation of the opposition in performing some miracle that is deem impossible.</p>
              <p>If there is any voice or feedback, they should stand up and speak out NOW and not wait till some years later.</p>

              <p>Singaporean remain dumb and stupid and expect the one that they vote will take care of them.</p>

              <p>Just look at who is at the board and that would give you some idea.</p>
              <p>The reason why they import more foreigners is that they are cheap labour and will be voting to which party that give them money.</p>
              <p>Once again, the self proclaimed leaders are also dumb and stupid to think that the foreigners are cheaper, dumber and easy to control.</p>
              <p>By the way, the COE and opposition came out from their hole after the issue is resolved.</p>
              <p>The funny thing is that COE went to the dorm that have NO issues instead of the reported dorm with issues.</p>
              <p>Is this the opposition that you supposed to support ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>we must do one time good good punsh them by pushing in more charges, canning them and fine them then immediatly send them home after a short sentence. unless our prison life for these foregn offender so good that they like to stay there instead of MBS hotel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the place dormitory dirty is caused by those foregn workers them selve. why must SMRT and the dorm operators act silly and blur and give in to them? unles their ne place is aalso isolated from HDB residence, if not they will bring more bring those bedbug and noise problem to HDB residence now, worse with their savage and babaric nature, who knows mayb next time if you just happen to be in one of teh falt occupied by one cheena, then some lovers not happy they start killing people anyhow.</p>

              <p><br>i agree to a certain extend. the china donw know their rights. they know and intentionally fan a strike and indirectly an act of terrorism to get what they wanted.</p>
              <p>they rights are to infomr 14 days in advance before strike. these HR shouyld have briefed them , on a separate orientation program. and working on a foeign land, undertanding and clarifying their basic employments laws are stragners to a foreign land will do in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> i think most who take up driving are family men and women, although young peole can also join. increasing pay by steps is good, and even not with cash everymonth like 100 or 200 dollars vouchers from NTUC fairprice are also good incentives since people will need to buy groceries also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the gahmen will never do this because they want earn levy and oither political aims.</p>
              <p>singapore has never been short of manpower. its gamen moves, and mamagement want easy management of foregn labor can make them work like slaves while sgreans grumble a lot they claim. </p>

              <p><br>minority, and i say real monority of singapore bosses are more scarde they will lose their jobs if they cannot explain to their top upon question, should they raise the pay.</p>
              <p>but int his case we see SMRT clearly stated their pay and wage system, part of it as lodging for the cheena drivers. if cheena people wanna count this, then sgrean can also count our utilitize bills, bus transport to comapny to work, meals, our housing rent and loans - can like that?</p>
              <p>the cheena must be punished - by strike and act of terrorism. this is real.</p>
              <p>the cheena must know theya re the ones making noise and dirtying their dorms, damage also their own kind do one if not who? expect others to be blamed? what smrt can do is only to increase frequency of cleaning and maintencance. no need to move elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Medicated oil. let you know that strenght in numbers and unity is just an illusion. no matter how united they are, look at the drivers now? only 4 took the rep. the remeinder? did they also stood by the 4 when the law comes down on the lot? so much for unity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For you info we may know about some unity of the cheena during ww2 against japanses, but we must also know how many much more of them betrayed the country. unity and tactical retreat is no use beauces history has shown that the japs keep cutting off they supply lines, from theiur big floody rivers until the burma road, and routes. it was with the assistence of the allied foreces and americans that they can finally fight back and claim their miserable land.</p>

              <p>I see it in another way.</p>
              <p>If strike is illegal here, all of them should be arrested for taking part in the strike even though they are on medical leave.</p>
              <p>But, if all of them are arrested, it will sour the relationship with their Ah Kong.</p>
              <p>So, just have to take care of their "leaders".</p>
              <p>But, the rest of the guys will still be unhappy over the treatment and awaiting the eventual outcome next Monday.</p>
              <p>Even with a minor pay increase, they will still be unhappy and may end up reporting sick more often.</p>
              <p>The most thorough solution is to replace all of them.</p>
