              </p><p>Date of Issue: 28 November 2012 </p>
              <p><strong>Update on SMRT Service Leaders  </strong></p>
              <p>The rate of attendance of Service Leaders (SLs) on 28 November is back to normal and all our bus services are running as scheduled. </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, SMRT personnel, including 20 of our Chinese SLs, are currently assisting the police in their investigation into possible breaches of the law as a result of the strike. </p>
              <p><strong>Addressing the concerns of Service Leaders </strong></p>
              <p>We would like to address the concerns raised by the SLs from China. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remuneration</span></p>
              <p>Unlike SLs from Malaysia, who are employed on a permanent basis, SLs from China are hired on 2-year contracts that carry different terms of employment. While the starting pay for SLs from China is lower, the company provides for their accommodations and utilities as well as daily transport to their workplace. </p>
              <p>As part of SMRT’s ongoing salary review, in July 2012, all SLs under permanent employment received an increment in their starting pay. A special increment was also given to the SLs from China even though such an increase is not in their contract. Another round of salary adjustments for SLs under permanent employment was made in October 2012. Similarly, an additional adjustment of $25 per month for SLs from China was finalised last week and we were in the process of communicating this.  </p>
              <p>SMRT pays competitive market wages. Labour markets and wages vary in different countries. Taking into account the foreign worker levy and the provision of transport, accommodations and utilities, our remuneration packages for SLs from China and Malaysia are equitable. The table in Annex A shows a comparison of the remuneration packages. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dormitory conditions</span></p>
              <p>The SLs had earlier raised, with SMRT, concerns on the living conditions, such as bed bugs at the dormitories provided by private operators. Fumigation works were scheduled at the Woodlands dormitory but have not been carried out yet. We acknowledge that swifter actions could have been taken to improve the conditions of the dormitories. We will implement fumigation as soon as possible, and other improvement measures such as remedial works on fittings are already underway. We have also decided to provide alternative accommodations when the leases at the dormitories expire from early 2013. </p>
              <p>Management had assured the SLs during the discussion on 26 Nov that it will review and address their concerns. We will share our decision with the SLs next week. </p>
              <p>On the latest developments, Executive Vice President (Roads &amp; Commercial) Ms Teo Chew Hoon said: "There are lessons from this episode, including how we can better engage our SLs, and we will improve in this area. In the meantime, we are doing our utmost to make immediate improvements to their living conditions.  </p>
              <p>For majority of our Chinese SLs who are putting their best in their duties, I would like to reassure them that we continue to value their services.” </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;">(Reuters) - This week's walkout in Singapore by dozens of mainland Chinese bus drivers over disparities in pay would have been considered small, calm and short-lived in almost any other nation.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">But the strike, in breach of the law and mostly over by Wednesday, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">was the first significant industrial action in the tightly regulated Asian financial centre in more than 25 years.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">For the first two days of this week, buses ran late and crowded in a city that prides itself on efficiency, leading to complaints from customers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">"This is Singapore NOT <a style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" title="Full coverage of China" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/china">China</a>. If you cannot follow the law of the land please go back to your own country and strike," Today newspaper reader Leonard Low wrote on the paper's website.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">After a tough election last year, the strike highlights challenges for the long-ruling government of the majority ethnic Chinese island as it tries to defuse anger over an influx of immigrants while discouraging labour unrest that could hurt investment.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">The action by the drivers from China, over complaints they are paid less than Singaporean and Malaysian peers, also underlines the treatment of lower-skilled foreign workers who are vital to the <span class="mandelbrot_refrag"><a class="mandelbrot_refrag" style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" href="http://www.reuters.com/sectors/industries/overview?industryCode=46&amp;lc=int_mb_1001">construction</a></span>, hospitality and transport sectors in the wealthy city-state.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">"There's a danger in becoming too emotional about it," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Not many Singaporeans want to work as bus drivers at this kind of wage levels. You need foreign workers to fill the gap."</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">Chua said companies would have to get used to higher wage demands by lower-skilled foreign workers, given the much larger salary increases in countries such as China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">In the case of SMRT Corp Ltd (<span id="symbol_SMRT.SI_0"><a style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=SMRT.SI">SMRT.SI</a></span>), one of two bus companies that ply Singapore's roads, Chinese nationals account for about 450 of the 2,000 or so drivers on its payroll.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">Kit Wei Zheng, an economist at Citigroup, said more labour disputes could emerge given developments in the region.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">"Globally and regionally, there is greater labour activism taking place," he said. "In China, you have seen more assertive industrial action so, in hindsight, it was not surprising that some of these pressures reached Singapore's shores."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a global financial centre with the world's highest concentration of millionaires, Singapore is awash with flashy cars, pricey shops and fancy <span class="mandelbrot_refrag"><a class="mandelbrot_refrag" style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" href="http://www.reuters.com/sectors/industries/overview?industryCode=89&amp;lc=int_mb_1001">restaurants</a></span> that epitomise the wealth of foreign and domestic businesspeople and bankers.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">But much of the vitriol against immigrants - about stealing jobs, pushing up housing costs and crowding public transport - is directed at the most visible, those who do the tough and dirty work and are among the lowest paid.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">"These (Chinese) drivers don't deserve the same salary and benefits," Singapore resident Bao Heng wrote on Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan Jin's <span class="mandelbrot_refrag"><a class="mandelbrot_refrag" style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" href="http://www.reuters.com/subjects/facebook?lc=int_mb_1001">Facebook</a></span> page. "Many Singaporeans would agree with me that Malaysians drivers are safer drivers."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">While comments in newspapers and Internet postings suggest many Singaporeans favour a hard line against the striking bus drivers, support for them was high in their native China.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Come back brothers, plenty of opportunities back home," one person wrote on the Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Should go on strike. This is a form of discrimination. Should be equal pay for equal work," said another posting.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">ZERO TOLERANCE</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singapore, which saw its last major industrial action in 1986 at a U.S. oilfield equipment firm, has no minimum wage and prohibits workers in public transport and other essential services from going on strike without giving notice of 14 days.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">In taking action that Tan, the acting manpower minister, said "clearly crossed the line", 171 Chinese drivers did not show up for work on Monday and 88 did not report on Tuesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">Most of them returned to duty on Wednesday after officials from the Chinese embassy spoke with them late on Tuesday.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">Tan said his ministry expected SMRT, controlled by powerful state investor Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd , to address the grievances but that the government had "zero tolerance for such unlawful action".</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">The National Trades Union Congress, which does not represent the Chinese drivers, said <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"any action that is illegal must and will be dealt with firmly, regardless of whether the workers are local or foreign".</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">The drivers complain SMRT switched them to a six-day week with slightly higher pay from a five-day week that had allowed them to earn more by doing overtime.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">One driver told the Lianhe Wanbao newspaper he now was paid S$1,400 a month, lower than the S$2,000 he used to be able to make with overtime on days off. The Chinese are also angry about getting less than Singaporean and Malaysian drivers.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus drivers, whether Chinese or Singaporean, are not highly paid in a country where the 2011 median monthly salary was about S$3,250 for citizens and permanent residents. </span></strong>Foreign maids and nannies - most of them from <a style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" title="Full coverage of Indonesia" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the Philippines and <span class="mandelbrot_refrag"><a class="mandelbrot_refrag" style="color: #006e97; cursor: pointer; outline: none;" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/myanmar?lc=int_mb_1001">Myanmar</a></span> - do even worse, getting as little as S$500 a month.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">SMRT, which calls its drivers "service leaders" (SLs), said it lodged a police report over possible breaches of the law and urged the Chinese workers to use proper channels for complaints.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;">"We have stressed to the SLs that the lines of communication to management remain open and they should not take such unlawful actions to air their grievances," it said in a statement.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One of the striking workers, from China's Henan province, told media the drivers had gone to supervisors and their company human resources department but were told nothing could be done as the salary decisions were made by senior managers.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Why cant the SMRT management just announce the reaon for the difference in pay rise to the public, so that they can properly judge this event instead of just thinking that SMRT is being unfair.</p>
              <p>It can be some reasons like the malaysian drivers were not given a place to stay by the company and the chinese does, therefore its fair to give the malaysian drivers a fair bit of more salary. </p>
              <p>At least some in depth explanation will let the public know who is right and who is wrong, instead of going around bashing everyone involved.</p>

              <p>If raise the pay of drivers, will SGreans be willing to pay?</p>
              <p>If say they are willing to pay, then it will only be fair that shareholders cut dividend. We cant really go to the extreme end of removing dividends entirely, otherwise we risk blurring the line between public and pte co.</p>
              <p>But where then the co. going to get $$$ to purchase buses and expand?</p>

              <p>As you can see, all routes lead eventually to govt intervention. Not market laissez faire. Especially in such a situation where both co.s are monopolising.</p>

              <p>I dare say if its fellow ASEAN peeps do crap, we probably will smack them in place.</p>
              <p>Look at how we hanged foreigners over drugs, though arguably, that one is different case (we are used to hanging people despite howls of protests!).</p>
              <p>Maybe because its first strike in decades, that's why cheng hu suddenly caught off guard.</p>
              <p>And also because now China power transition, very unpredictable. We already had a taste of how the Chinese are ruthless when they want it their way, when they poured cold water on us at Suzhou.</p>
