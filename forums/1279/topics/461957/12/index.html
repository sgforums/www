              <span style="font-size: 14.40000057220459px;">SMRT managed to get
              95 per cent of its bus services running today despite about 60
              China-born bus drivers not turning up for work.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.40000057220459px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19.200000762939453px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              The operator used drivers from competitor SBS Transit and standby
              drivers, it was revealed at a Ministry of Manpower press conference
              that has concluded</p>

              On Monday, when 102 drivers refused to work because of unhappiness
              over salary, SMRT got 90 per cent of its services running.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.40000057220459px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19.200000762939453px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              Acting Minister Tan Chuan-Jin had harsh words for the drivers at
              the conference, reiterating that their action was
              "unacceptable".</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.40000057220459px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19.200000762939453px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              The illegal strike is being investigated by the police.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.40000057220459px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19.200000762939453px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              Mr Tan said that under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act,
              a strike of essential service workers is illegal if 14 days' notice
              was not given.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.40000057220459px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19.200000762939453px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
              Under the Act, those found guilty can be fined not more than $2,000
              and/or a prison term of not more than a year.</p>

              <p>I don't think the whole lot of striking workers (102 or 62) will get it. I'm sure some of them would be charged if they are found to have flouted the law (in the statement released by the MOM...the striking workers have clearly flouted the law...now I guess it's up to police to ascertain whom among the group was truly ill on thoese two days). Penalty is $2000 fine or maximum imprisonment of 12 months. Those found guilty of inciting the strike is liable for prosection too apparently. Anyway the worse case is some of them will be fined/given a short prison sentence. Those convicted, I doubt they would be able to continue to work in Singapore and have their work permits revoked and deported to China. </p>
              <p>But what is worrying is whether the actions of these workers would inspire others to strike. Would their plight inspire their fellow Chinese nationals to stand in solidarity with them and call for a legal strike/illegal strike. </p>

              <p><strong>UPDATE on Wed 28/11: All drivers who went on strike on Monday have 
                  returned to work on Wednesday morning.</strong></p>
              <p><br>While bus captains from 
                  China do work the same hours as drivers of other nationalities, it's fair that 
                  they are paid less because they get transportation and housing, say some SMRT 
                  bus drivers.<br> <br>Speaking to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> on an anonymous basis 
                  on Tuesday, several Singaporean and Malaysian bus drivers in general voiced this 
                  sentiment in the wake of <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/-over-100-chinese-bus-drivers-in-s-pore-go-on-strike-105924025.html">Monday’s full-day Chinese bus drivers’ 
                  strike</a>.<br> <br>“(Chinese bus drivers) shouldn’t be paid the same amount (as 
                  Malaysians) because they have lodging here,” said one Singaporean driver who has 
                  been with SMRT for four years. “They also have transport to and fro, whereas 
                  Malaysians have to travel back home across the Causeway every 
                  day.”<br> <br>“They (Chinese and Malaysian nationals) probably shouldn’t be 
                  earning the same amount since they (the Chinese) are provided with 
                  accommodation,” echoed another local bus captain, who has worked with both SBS 
                  Transit and SMRT over more than 20 years. <br> <br>Noting further that the terms 
                  for salary arrangements would have been agreed upon before the drivers first 
                  came to Singapore, he said that if they were not violated or changed in any way 
                  upon their arrival, the drivers in question should by right have nothing to 
                  complain about.<br><br>Other drivers adopted a more moderate view of the 
                  situation, however, and said they could see where the striking bus captains were 
                  coming from.<br><br>"I do think they should earn equal pay," said a 60-year-old 
                  Singaporean driver, who has worked more than 10 years with SMRT. "After all, 
                  they work the same hours and have the same duties."<br><br>Another local bus 
                  captain said he felt that it would be fair for the transport operator to up the 
                  pay of the Chinese drivers by a certain percentage, but taking into account 
                  additional accommodation costs, he, too, said it should eventually still come to 
                  below the amount Malaysian drivers earn.<br><br>"They could maybe negotiate a 
                  small increment, maybe up to 20 to 30 per cent less than Malaysian drivers given 
                  the accommodation issue," he said. "I do think their pay system should be fairer 
                  but at the same time I think it's a tough situation."<br><br>One Malaysian bus 
                  driver who spoke to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> was visibly annoyed at Monday's 
                  strike, saying the move to do so was "irresponsible and uncalled 
                  for".<br><br>"First of all, they should have approached the management first to 
                  discuss things," he said. "Going on strike is illegal and we all understand 
                  that."<br><br>He shared that starting out as a bus driver here, his base pay was 
                  about $650 a month. Coupled with a twice-daily commute between Johor and work, 
                  he said Malaysian bus drivers don't have it as easy as their Chinese colleagues, 
                  for whom accommodation and transport is provided to and from their respective 
                  bus depots.<br><br>"We (Malaysians) have been here for more than 10 years, how 
                  can they compare with us?" he asked. "Even if a Malaysian and a Chinese driver 
                  have the same amount of experience, housing rental isn't cheap here -- it 
                  eventually adds up."<br><br>In fact, he said, if any comparison should be done, 
                  it should be between Chinese and new Singaporean drivers, who are offered 
                  significantly more in pay than drivers of any other nationality.<br><br>"In any 
                  case, Indian bus drivers (who hold PR) are paid the same as us -- they also have 
                  to settle their own housing arrangements," he said. "Why only pinpoint us? Why 
                  drag us into this?"<br><br>Asked for her views on the strike, however, one 
                  female driver from China said she fully supported it, but did not join it for 
                  fear of losing her job.<br><br>"They may say that we are given accommodation, 
                  but have you seen the accommodation they give us? It isn't fit for humans," she 
                  said in Mandarin. "Eight of us share a room, and there isn't any walking space 
                  between our beds. I've also been bitten by rats and insects on multiple 
                  occasions before."<br><br>Nonetheless, she said all that is still bearable 
                  compared to the disparity in pay they receive for their work.<br><br>"This 
                  really is unfair to us. We do the exact same work, work for the same number of 
                  hours and yet we don't receive the same compensation. Our living conditions back 
                  home are far, far better than they are here."<br><br>On Monday, more than 170 
                  SMRT bus captains from China went on a full-day strike at their Woodlands 
                  dormitories to protest the disparity in pay they received compared to their 
                  Malaysian counterparts. <br><br>While some of them returned to work on Tuesday, 
                  almost 90 of them persisted in their strike, as trade union representatives 
                  attempted to mediate discussions between them and SMRT.<br><br>The transport 
                  operator said in a statement on Tuesday evening that it has also filed a police 
                  report over "possible breaches of the law", while conducting internal 
                  investigations to determine whether or not employment terms had been breached.</p>
