              <p>to strike effectively and swee swee, the strikers have to be smart and need better coordination, so that the cause is not to casue public discomfort and disruption, and at the same time get what they want without gahmen givin excuse for hikes.</p>

              <p><strong>By MARIA ALMENOAR<br></strong>TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>COMMUTERS have overwhelmingly rejected the notion of increasing public transport fares to help improve the pay of bus drivers.</p>
              <p>   A Straits Times street and online poll of 325 commuters yesterday found that 92 per cent of respondents are opposed to the idea that Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew strongly hinted at on Thursday.</p>
              <p>   The response of Mr Lau Yong Fong, an IT support engineer, was typical of the majority.</p>
              <p>   Said the 34-year-old: "It is good to increase salaries of bus drivers, but you can't just push it to commuters. The Government has to think of other alternatives before increasing fares."</p>
              <p>   Among the suggestions they made: Cut the bonus of top executives of the two public transport operators, require the operators SMRT and SBS Transit to use profits to pay the drivers more, or have the Government subsidise the increase in wages.</p>
              <p>   Mr Lui had hinted at the possibility of bus fares being raised when he commented on last week's illegal strike by 180 SMRT bus drivers from China over living conditions and pay.</p>
              <p>   He said fares might go up in future to help cover the cost of raising the wages of bus drivers. He also expressed hope that an ongoing fare review would allow the operators to increase drivers' pay.</p>
              <p>   Commuters acknowledged Mr Lui's point that the bus drivers deserve to be paid more, but were adamant that the cost be borne by SMRT and SBS Transit.</p>
              <p>   Undergraduate Frank Poh, 24, said the operators needed to play their part and bear the costs.</p>
              <p>   "It is ridiculous that the Government pays partially for infrastructure, the public pays for the pay rise - bearing in mind the operational profit is in the hundreds of millions of dollars - then what about the company?" he asked.</p>
              <p>   Commuters argued that the operators were making healthy profits and could well afford the additional cost. "If the companies are not making pro-fits, then it is fine to increase bus fares, but they make so much money," said restaurant manager Kamal Bashyal, 35.</p>
              <p>   Similarly, supermarket cashier Jenny Wong, 34, said in Mandarin: "This is unreasonable. When they make profits, do they pass them on to commuters as discounts in fares? Why don't they use the profits to increase the salaries of drivers?"</p>
              <p>   SMRT's last full-year net profit was $119.9 million while that of ComfortDelGro, which runs SBS Transit, was $235.6 million. Both listed companies have rail and taxi operations in addition to buses.</p>
              <p>   National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der-Horng said that as public transport services were a public good, the operators should look for ways internally to increase their efficiency. "They should consider all other alternatives and cut their costs before approaching the commuters, as a last resort," he said.</p>
              <p>   He pointed out that the goal in privatising public transport was for the companies to run the service efficiently and profitably. "When they claim that fare revenue is not enough to cover their costs, I would have to disagree with that," he said.</p>
              <p>   For the small group of commuters in favour of a fare rise to help bus drivers, they were agreeable if the increase was between two and five cents.</p>
              <p>   But they said such an increase would be fair only if there was a corresponding improvement in bus services. Said hotel cleaner Pari Natasina, 50: "Bus drivers are very hard-working, and if the raise is only a bit, it's okay. It's understandable."</p>

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Recently, it has been announced that bus fares will be increased in order to increase the wages of the bus drivers. This has led to many locals blaming the China bus drivers. This is a way for SMRT to divert attention from the real problem, and instigate Singaporeans to hate migrant workers. In actual fact, SMRT has made MILLIONS of dollars in revenue. Being a public service organisation, there isn't a need for SMRT to make so much profit. The pay of the directors and top management can be lowered while those of the bus drivers should be increased, and this should come without needing to raise the bus fares. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">This is an attempt by the government to instigate hate, and push the blame around, while pocketing most of the money. The Singapore government is practicing LEGAL corruption.</span></em></p>
