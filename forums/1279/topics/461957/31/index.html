              <p>Dude, I understand your frustrations but we can't totally blame the foreign workers. Somehow they had also become the victims of this govt policy of "cheap and good" which is as good as cheap labour, modern slavery (whichever terms you put it), after Singaporeans have given a taste of it years back. Everyone works to earn more money, not to be cheap labour forever. Obviously you can see SMRT Corp is at total fault and the govt make use of this chance to exploit Singaporeans again.</p>
              <p>That's why don't totally depend on public services, like public transport. If you can afford your own transport, then go for it. No need to go for such frustration every year, no need to hung on your dear life on relying on just public transport everyday.</p>

              <p>Voting for opposition does not mean all the problems will go away, that's what I agree. However by allowing more opposition seats into the parliament, at least the ruling party will be kept in check on what they are doing, serving the people or for their own purposes.</p>
              <p>The ruling party has already been out of touch with its citizens and the country. And more people are unhappy and questioning the ruling party's reasons for many problems surfaced. However, what kind of explainations do we see all the time? All kinds of twisting of words from one side to another side, saying one thing but doing another, unlogical and unthinkable silly logics that gives them whichever possible paths to explain their way out to lie to Singaporeans. The trust is fading.</p>
              <p>It takes 2 hands to clap. If the govt has lost touch with its citizens, and the citizens are losing faith with them, is the society as a whole still gearing towards a future?</p>

              <p>After all these episode, I (and many Singaporeans) believe that SMRT is not capable of operating public buses at all. I seriously hope that SBST will take over all of SMRTB public bus operations in years to come.</p>
              <p>All these years after takeover from TIBS, SMRTB has shown its incapability of operating a decent bus service to Singaporeans and its continuous committment of dragging and denying problems again and again instead of stepping up and doing improvements. Even after the first internal main arguement which almost turned out to be major strike many years back (which was even when there aren't many PRC BCs), SMRT refused to learn from its lessons and continue its bad policies in its HR policies, workers' treatment, bus operations management and schedulings and service and fleet management and maintanance.</p>
              <p>The problems inside the company, e.g. poor management overall, poorly maintained and dirty bus fleet, poorly planned schedules, slow in improvements, messy fleet and deployments, poor workers relationships with 2 major strikes, delays with long bus queues and erratic frequencies, terrible customer and PR services, overcrowded bus depots and space constraints in parking of buses, and worst of all, never make profits and always in the red year after year. SMRT should sell off it bus division to SBST, its cab division to TransCab and focus its resources and time entirely on its already problematic rail operations.</p>
              <p>I am also disgusted by how SMRTB manages its renumeration between foreigners which turns out to a biased treatment between foreigners of different nationalities and how it deceives Singaporeans on the number of people joining the strikes for the first 2 days and trying to hide the difference between a strike and terms like "sit-in, mass MC, etc".</p>
              <p>The way that this company handles the situation, the way it mass hires their "cheap and good" workers, the way this company puts our country to shame globally is really good enough to make Singaporeans to all agree that such a company like SMRT should be delisted, stop paying fat dividends to shareholders, scaling down whichever operations that they shoudln't do, and get back to real business and focus all their resources, money into their core business, public transport rail system with decent service standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This should also give a good wake up call to the current incumbent governing this country that FTs are not cheap and good as well. Singaporeans are not stupid to be paid as cheap labours and they are seriously aggrevated by your policies of importing cheap foreign labors while depressing Singaporeans' wages while costs of livings keep on increasing amid increasing overcrowding, overstressing infrastructures, demand overweighed supply, etc.</p>
              <p>You can do that to Singaporeans, but Singaporeans will not be happy with you and most already do. You can do that to foreigners, they aren't dumb to stay as cheap labor forever. Everyone who works wants to have a better life, not to be cheap labors forever, Singaporean or not. Your cheap and good policy have failed and it pissed off many FTs working here and angers many Singaporeans here. It may even go to the extend of damaging ties with a strong power and economy if not handled properly and might detering foreign firms to further invest in Singapore.</p>
              <p>These might happen just because of your greed of your million dollar salaries, your disconcern towards the basic moral aspect of treating your own citizens with proper respect. and artifically inflate costs of living, depressing wages and insisting your concerns of keeping on artifically increasing the population for no significant purposes and contributions to the country and the future generations. Singapore is going to be ruined by you, why do we still need you after 2016?</p>

              Offer shares to the public again....let them buy those shares...people with money will buy it...look at the future and when the economy is good...when the Singaporean workers' wages are good...increase the fares..we don't mind that...offer dividends to the shareholders when the time is right. The second option...offer to international well established transport company or companies to join venture with SMRT...open IPO if need be...since the way I look at it SMRT couldn't handle the transport system that efficiently themselves. Third option....your money are invested with GICS...for instance... your CPF contributions...the government should injected those profits overseas back into Singapore again...like in SMRT.

              Really! That means Singapore is first class country but Singaporeans are earning like those workers in developed countries...Just to add some information here....starting next year...all Malaysian workers in Malaysia will have a minimum monthly basic salary of RM900...and that is mandatory. Their ringgit value is lower than sing dollars...but they have many international investors coming in to their country.
