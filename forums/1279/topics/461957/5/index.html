              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNormal">This whole incident just shows the weakness of Singapore’s
              over-reliance of cheap foreign labour. If one day all these cheap foreign
              labourers decide to call in sick and stop work, what’s going to happen?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I won’t comment on SMRT HR practices since I don’t know what’s
              going on – whether it’s fair to the Chinese nationals or not. However, if SMRT
              provides their dorms and their dorm conditions are deemed unsatisfactory for
              living, I believe that is only decent for SMRT to do something about it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I understand that they’re here to make a living, make lots
              of money to go back home. So why wouldn’t they not want higher pay and benefits
              just like their Singapore and Malaysia counterparts. But the reality is that
              inequity exists, and you may find me callous to say this, but they just have to
              suck it up.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">That said, I don’t see the need to negotiate with the
              Chinese nationals. The Chinese nationals are no pushovers. They’re here to make
              a living, they don’t care whether their mass falling sick would have an impact
              on company’s operations or affect the general public – Singaporeans like you
              and me. Not trying to stereotype – but it’s only natural that they act in their
              own interests.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Giving in to them would just embolden them and others to do
              the same. There would be a second time, a third time, if they succeed this
              first time. I know it’s evil to say this, but send them packing back to China.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Talks between SMRT management and its 102 bus drivers who refused to report for work on Monday have concluded.<br> <br> According to workers Channel NewsAsia spoke to, SMRT management has 
              indicated that the company will come back with a reply in approximately a
               week's time.<br> <br> It is also understood that the 102 workers have agreed to return to work.<br> <br> A spokesman for SMRT said the bus drivers involved were from China and 
              that earlier reports saying nearly 200 bus drivers were involved were 
              incorrect.<br> <br> It is understood that the bus drivers had stayed away from work as a result of unhappiness over their pay.<br> <br> According to residents living in the Woodlands dormitory where the bus 
              drivers are staying, the drivers had refused to leave for work at 4am 
              Monday when several SMRT buses arrived at the dormitory to pick them up.<br> <br> Officials from SMRT headquarters have been at the dormitory since Monday morning. Talks began at about 4pm.<br> <br> About 50 bus drivers were involved in the talks.<br> <br> An SMRT spokesperson said that drivers who were not rostered to work on 
              Monday were requested to work as a result of the no-show by the 102 
              drivers.<br> <br> Separately, the National Transport Workers' Union (NTWU) issued a 
              statement that said the union could not represent the affected workers 
              as they were not union members.<br> <br> NTWU urged the workers involved to return to work immediately and added 
              that the union was prepared to help in negotiations between SMRT 
              management and the workers if both parties welcomed its involvement.<br> <br> SMRT said that relevant authorities have already been informed about the
               situation, adding that the company has been hiring bus drivers from 
              China since 2008.<br> <br> - CNA/jc</p>
