              <p><br> The transport fare increased had actually been raised in the media
                      prior to the China bus drivers strike. What really amused me is
                      that they always mentioned where they are going to get the money
                      from for the bus drivers' salary increment. Have they not earned
                      enough profits from passengers already and I'm very sure the
                      Singapore Government could provide or subsidized that budget for
                      the bus drivers' salaries in short term while SMRT cover its loses
                      in operation. GIC has alot of money you know.</p>

              <p>The logic of the miw govt, you earn they tax you like the recent increase in property tax for HDB flats base on reason that more are renting their flats.    If they need to spend money they make the public pay for it.     Smelly, in Chinese we called them chaokuan.   </p>
              <p>This govt really is jiak singaporeans jiak si si, bloody ................   their karma will catch up with them if not this life will be after their death.  They have no compassion for the less fortunate.       puay kok kia !</p>
              <p>Does not look like it they are managing a country, looks more like they are managing a business.   They are always on their toes to make sure they don't lose money in the business.</p>

              operating cost is very very high in the first place..
              
              why? cos continual of bus svs during the off peak hrs, still need to ply industrial estate during off peak hrs...

              some people later tio pwned...
              
              back in 1993, SBS just uses $200k to buy 1 single decker bus... Today that single decker bus cost at least $340k...
              
              If they dun keep profits, they'll never be able to keep up w/ all these inflation... Neither in reality, they can go into doing other things.. Ah Bear ever said something abt it before...
              
              As for MRT, if they dun keep profits and keep those as cash, 15 - 20 yrs later, ask who for money to replace the aging mechanical items???
              
              That's why all along the profits intention is to keep the money for future needs... not to be like SMRT, 80% all give out as divd etc...

              <p>Public govt Transport company did say before they need to increase fares to be accountable to the shareholders.       It goes back to the country is managed like a business.   If someone doesn't like what I just said about accountable to shareholders I heck care , that is the truth from them.    </p>

              Then... Let's take it, as though it's nationalised... some of your dunno how to open up.. end of the day, financing option is very limited...
              
              Business or not, ask you go run.. since you like to talk a lot without giving what u think... obviously a lot of things you've no idea... ppl tell you this, you just believe...
              
              There's no offence, but it's an offence to start playing politics and get yourself burnt..,
              
              Now.. you nationalise it... 1st thing, can they even take in ads as supplement revenue? Is 
              that adding profit or supplementing income? If it's latter, it's public service for goddamned sake!
              
              So strict terms, only from fare collection... but in reality, no one makes any decent surplus from bus ops...
              
              Then, as a nationalised entity.... They can't keep surplus from the budget allocated... The fleet replacement or train refurbishment has to be from allocated govt budget from a particular budget year... Yes, 1x big chunk of money accumulated for years... so then, prior to that, since you alrdy say cannot make profits, what right the finance ministry keep so much surplus for raining day?
              
              The way you go about, is anything would never suit you... But when it comes to need money, dun one fine day end up either way you say cannot this, cannot that...

              <p>So how ?</p>
              <p>Squeeze the public lor to increase fares lor as the demand for bus services is in-elastic. <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  "> <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
