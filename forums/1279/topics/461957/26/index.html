              <p>Frankly, screw all these activists. Who are they to interfere in Singapore's affairs? I dislike their 'I'm holier than thou' moralist approach. Hey, US, Australia and many other countries have issues with human rights too. And please, China itself has human rights issues. And seriously, those people from Hong Kong protesting about us? Seriously, some of your people have voiced their approval against giving domestic workers PR in Hong Kong, and many are not happy with China, so what gives you the moral high ground to criticise Singapore?</p>
              <p>That said, Singapore is lacking in the area of human rights or freedom. Something had got to give in the pursuit of wanting to become affluent, so our moral compass was sacrificed. We had some freedoms taken away. Yes, it all boils down to the pro-business policy and of course businesses want to reduce costs so cheap labour is good for them in order to make more profit. </p>
              <p>As for no rights to strike, well, giving our self-serving attitude, don't you think that Singaporeans would abuse that freedom to strike for better pay and all that. If we don't have a stable labour force, what will happen? Companies will pull out. Companies like Singapore because of its pro business policy which makes doing business stable.  </p>

              <p><br>good. china factories are competing themselves for cheapness. they own people are also striking and fighting their own when internally their businesses move.</p>
              <p>for a country that can be so cheap like china, its a metter of time that they will fight against themselve for cheapness.</p>
              <p>seems like our gahmen are mostly good life people living on ivory towers. most of them travel to lots of countries but the gahmen ther ewill nevertell you their own plans and intention, their own sets of problem that is shameful. so they think going here and tehre they can copy their stuff and ideas and know alot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>telling us cheap is better and to be faster is no longer relevent. telling us GDP and have to hire more aliens every GE and next GE is like telling us mee shiam comes with hum and you cna tell hawler dont wna tit by saying 'mai hump'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its time to slow everything down and hire sgreans. beef up our own workforce so that when it do eventually pick up (which mauy not be so fast within the next 10 years) Europe and US is screwed. and cheena cannot do much at the momnet with the better part of the world in depresson. the westerners if wanna prevent cheena from developing into powerhouse is to shut them all out.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By CHRISTOPHER TAN <br>SENIOR CORRESPONDENT </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT'S new chief executive is calling in senior Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) officers to beef up command and control in the transport operator's set-up.</p>
              <p>   In one of his first planned tweaks to his management team, Mr Desmond Kuek - himself a retired lieutenant-general - is understood by The Straits Times to be hiring two or three senior SAF officers to take up key appointments in the coming months.</p>
              <p>   Sources said one is Colonel Gerard Koh, who is poised to join next month as director of human resources - a department that has been in the news since last week's bus drivers' strike. Hehas held various HR positions. His latest post is head of national service affairs.</p>
              <p>   The last military man at the SMRT HR department was retired colonel Low Ah Tee, a one-time HR general manager.</p>
              <p>   Mr Low and more than half a dozen senior executives retired or quit when retailer Saw Phaik Hwa helmed the SMRT between 2002 and January this year.</p>
              <p>   Sources said Mr Kuek, 49, intends to appoint another senior officer, a logistics specialist, to the bus division. It has not only been loss-making for years, but also made the news when 171 drivers from China went on an illegal strike.</p>
              <p>   The Defence Ministry said it did not comment on its officers' career moves. "We do not share such information with the press," a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>   Mr Kuek, who took over SMRT in October, is also keeping mum. But he let on in a recent Lianhe Zaobao interview that SMRT will undergo a major reshuffle "from top to bottom" to meet future challenges and improve service.</p>
              <p>   "There are clearly managerial, structural, cultural and systemic issues that need addressing. And that is one of my top priorities."</p>
              <p>   Observers said his move was understandable. Mr Lim Jit Soon, senior analyst at stockbroking house Nomura, said: "There's apparently been a breakdown of protocol and (Mr Kuek) is trying to restore command and control."</p>
              <p>   Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport chairman Cedric Foo said observations were made that SMRT, in recent years, pursued commercial objectives at some expense to operations. "If the objective (of the move) is to strike a better balance between the two, then it's a good thing," he said.</p>
              <p>   Singapore Human Resources Institute executive director David Ang said bringing in SAF officers should work if they have competencies and skills the SMRT needs. The key to whether they excel in the corporate world lies in whether they can adapt to the environment, provide leadership and manage diverse groups.</p>
              <p>   Meanwhile, the Temasek- owned listed SMRT also made recent changes to its board. It appointed Singapore Airlines veteran Yap Kim Wah, 63, as an independent director. He is known for his experience in customer service.</p>
              <p>   It has also appointed Yayasan Mendaki chief executive Moliah Hashim, 54. In a statement to the Singapore Exchange, SMRT said she had a lot to contribute to SMRT's corporate social responsibilities, "by highlighting the concerns and expectations of commuters and the community". It also announced that Mr Yeo Wee Kiong, 57, ceased to be a director.</p>

              I think having a female professional who is specialise in the logistics industry would be a good change for SMRT. There aren't many of them in the logistics career but it would be nice to see how a female could do a better job in managing, monitoring and moving hundreds of locomotive vehicles / thousands of passengers daily than military men or men for that matter.
                      
              In my opinion, though what was done and shown by the China bus drivers were considered as an illegal strike and it went against the Singapore harmonious industrial acts, I really admired them for their courage. Indirectly, they have succeeded in sending a strong message to all Singapore employers to make sure that working harmoniously with their employees is very important if the companies want to succeed. Indirectly too, China bus drivers have spoken for silent Singaporeans about their unhappiness with their management too.....like in the recent Channel News Asia "Vote" programme that had discussed on the SMRT China bus drivers illegal strike, 63% over had voted in favour of the China bus drivers action was justified. Its a wakeup call for all Singaporean employers and Singapore Government isn't it?

              The transport fare increased had actually been raised in the media prior to the China bus drivers strike. What really amused me is that they always mentioned where they are going to get the money from for the bus drivers' salary increment. Have they not earned enough profits from passengers already and I'm very sure the Singapore Government could provide or subsidized that budget for the bus drivers' salaries in short term while SMRT cover its loses in operation. GIC has alot of money you know.
