              <p>Hi SMRT,<br><br>The frequency for Service 966 is poor. With frequencies 
              averaging 13 - 16 minutes during the AM Peak and up to 20 minutes during off 
              peak hours, it is very frustrating for a lot of commuters, especially during the 
              AM peak hour where a lot of commuters need to wait so long to take this bus to 
              work / to school.  <br><br>Many a time, I have seen commuters <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not able to 
              board this service along Pending Road and Petir Road.</strong></span> <br><br>This is in 
              particular <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>630am to 700am (in Bukit Panjang Area)</strong></span> where a lot of 
              CJC students need to get to school and working adults travelling towards the 
              North East / East side of Singapore to work. The bus is cramped to the doors and 
              often bus driver skips these 3 bus stops.  <br><br>Another time was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>800am 
              to 900am (in Bukit Panjang Area)</strong></span> where the bus is cramped to the doors 
              and commuters have to wait up to 45 minutes to board the bus (Because the bus 
              skips their stop) and they end up making backup plans, such as taking 700 to 
              cross over the bridge at Whitley Road and transfer to other SBST services to 
              make their way to Jalan Toa Payoh and the East / North East. <br><br>I 
              personally have experienced it on 3 occassions while travelling to Toa Payoh on 
              966. <br>I was waiting for 966 at the last stop (Blk 202) along Petir 
              Road.<br><strong>18/11/08</strong><br>Missed the 815am (Bus was full and skipped my 
              stop)<br>Missed the 830am (Bus was full and skipped my stop once again)<br>At 
              840am, I decided to board 700 instead, and transfer to 105 to get to Jalan Toa 
              Payoh. <br><strong><br>25/11/08</strong><br>This time round, I became smarter and walked 
              further to Blk 223 Bus Stop along Bukit Panjang Road<br>Took the bus at 825am. 
              Had to stand but I managed to board the bus. <br>The bus skipped the Pending 
              Road, Petir Road Bus Stops all the way to Jalan Toa Payoh. 
              <br><br><strong>01/12/08</strong><br>My last bad experience was today. Wanted to travel to 
              Jalan Kolam Ayer. Boarded at Blk 202 Bus Stop. Reached bus stop at 1241pm. Bus 
              came at 109pm. I waited a total of 28 minutes for the bus. Isnt the frequency 
              supposed to be at most 20 minutes during off peak hours?  <br><br>I hope SMRT 
              can look into this matter. Perhaps by deploying 2 more buses during the peak 
              hour to smoothen the load and also improve overall frequency for Service 966. 
              Bus is usually quite packed with commuters during peak hours, even for the 
              Woodlands Bound 966 during PM Peak from 500pm to 1130pm.   <br><br>Thanks &amp; 
              Regards,<br>Mr. Lee Jun Yang<br>Frustrated Commuter<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

              <p>Should write in one for 851 also...packed till skipping bus stops with the deployments of the OCs. And there's <strong>no ghost at the back of the bus</strong>...it's really packed.</p>
              <p>Worst - frequencies are 20 minutes for 851 twds Yishun for some reason that day. So the next OC was also packed to the brim.</p>

              Payoh and the East / North East.<br> <br> I personally have experienced it on 3 occassions while travelling
              to Toa Payoh on 966.<br> I was waiting for 966 at the last stop (Blk 202) along Petir
              Road.<br> <strong>18/11/08</strong><br> Missed the 815am (Bus was full and skipped my stop)<br> Missed the 830am (Bus was full and skipped my stop once
              again)<br> At 840am, I decided to board 700 instead, and transfer to 105 to
              get to Jalan Toa Payoh.<br> <strong><br> 25/11/08</strong><br> This time round, I became smarter and walked further to Blk 223 Bus
              Stop along Bukit Panjang Road<br> Took the bus at 825am. Had to stand but I managed to board the
              bus.<br> The bus skipped the Pending Road, Petir Road Bus Stops all the way
              to Jalan Toa Payoh.<br> <br> <strong>01/12/08</strong><br> My last bad experience was today. Wanted to travel to Jalan Kolam
              Ayer. Boarded at Blk 202 Bus Stop. Reached bus stop at 1241pm. Bus
              came at 109pm. I waited a total of 28 minutes for the bus. Isnt the
              frequency supposed to be at most 20 minutes during off peak
              hours? <br> <br> I hope SMRT can look into this matter. Perhaps by deploying 2 more
              buses during the peak hour to smoothen the load and also improve
              overall frequency for Service 966. Bus is usually quite packed with
              commuters during peak hours, even for the Woodlands Bound 966
              during PM Peak from 500pm to 1130pm.  <br> <br> Thanks &amp; Regards,<br> Mr. Lee Jun Yang<br> Frustrated Commuter<br> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

              <p>No. There isn't any restriction. Last time a Mk1 bendy x-over to 966 from 963. There were no restrictions. So, 966 needs bendies.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once I boarded service 969 during the PM Peak hours from Tampines Int, the Sv 969 berth queue is quite long, but somehow , rigids were still deployed despite of the enormous long queues. When one rigid is full, half of the queue have to wait for the next bus which is either a rigid or a bendy. Ever since when I wanted to wait for SMB32T on 969, it was fully packed then I was being left out for the other half of the queue and waited another 5 to 10 mins for the next bus to arrive.</div>

              <p>That's why the problem of packed buses is that it makes commuters wait for the next bus which will usually come at the average frequency and packed again.</p>
              <p>Last time, when I want to go to Gulliemard Road, I would take 154 from my house to Tai Seng CCL station there at Upp Paya Lebar Road. I would wait for service 70. Everytime, it will always be packed. Then, I improvised and took service 8 to the bus stop that was 2 bus stops away from where I took 154 to. From there, I could easily get onto 70.</p>
