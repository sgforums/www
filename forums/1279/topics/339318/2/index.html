              <p>That's why the problem of packed buses is that it makes commuters wait for the next bus which will usually come at the average frequency and packed again.</p>
              <p>Last time, when I want to go to Gulliemard Road, I would take 154 from my house to Tai Seng CCL station there at Upp Paya Lebar Road. I would wait for service 70. Everytime, it will always be packed. Then, I improvised and took service 8 to the bus stop that was 2 bus stops away from where I took 154 to. From there, I could easily get onto 70.</p>

              <p>you must know which bus stops has the catchment.</p>
              <p>For example AM Peak I take 966 from Jln Toa Payoh to Eunos, I would alight at the SAJC bus stop instead of Blk 195 (I'm taking 8 26 31 90 142 from Toa Payoh Central) to change to 966.</p>
              <p>Reason: If I board at Blk 195, I have to squeeze witrh SA students for 1 bus stop before they alight and go to school. If I board at SAJC stop, I can slowly wait for them to disembark before I board the bus.</p>

              <p>Hi SMRT,<br><br>The frequency for Service 966 is poor. With frequencies averaging 13 - 16 minutes during the AM Peak and up to 20 minutes during off peak hours, it is very frustrating for a lot of commuters, especially during the AM peak hour where a lot of commuters need to wait so long to take this bus to work / to school. <br><br>Many a time, I have seen commuters <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not able to board this service along Pending Road and Petir Road.</strong></span><br><br>This is in particular <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>630am to 700am (in Bukit Panjang Area)</strong></span> where a lot of CJC students need to get to school and working adults travelling towards the North East / East side of Singapore to work. The bus is cramped to the doors and often bus driver skips these 3 bus stops. <br><br>Another time was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>800am to 900am (in Bukit Panjang Area)</strong></span> where the bus is cramped to the doors and commuters have to wait up to 45 minutes to board the bus (Because the bus skips their stop) and they end up making backup plans, such as taking 700 to cross over the bridge at Whitley Road and transfer to other SBST services to make their way to Jalan Toa Payoh and the East / North East.<br><br>I personally have experienced it on 3 occassions while travelling to Toa Payoh on 966.<br>I was waiting for 966 at the last stop (Blk 202) along Petir Road.<br><strong>18/11/08</strong><br>Missed the 815am (Bus was full and skipped my stop)<br>Missed the 830am (Bus was full and skipped my stop once again)<br>At 840am, I decided to board 700 instead, and transfer to 105 to get to Jalan Toa Payoh.<br><strong><br>25/11/08</strong><br>This time round, I became smarter and walked further to Blk 223 Bus Stop along Bukit Panjang Road<br>Took the bus at 825am. Had to stand but I managed to board the bus.<br>The bus skipped the Pending Road, Petir Road Bus Stops all the way to Jalan Toa Payoh.<br><br><strong>01/12/08</strong><br>My last bad experience was today. Wanted to travel to Jalan Kolam Ayer. Boarded at Blk 202 Bus Stop. Reached bus stop at 1241pm. Bus came at 109pm. I waited a total of 28 minutes for the bus. Isnt the frequency supposed to be at most 20 minutes during off peak hours? <br><br>I hope SMRT can look into this matter. Perhaps by deploying 2 more buses during the peak hour to smoothen the load and also improve overall frequency for Service 966. Bus is usually quite packed with commuters during peak hours, even for the Woodlands Bound 966 during PM Peak from 500pm to 1130pm.  <br><br>Thanks &amp; Regards,<br>Mr. Lee Jun Yang<br>Frustrated Commuter<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

              <p>i think e best solution is to introduce half trips, i.e. AM peak: WDL - Jin Eunos(terminates at opp Eunos MRT) n vicev versa for PM peak (starts from Eunos MRT).</p>

              <p>Wah!!! Nice one Jun Yang! I share the same feeling as yours..
              Everytime when I wait for 187/963/966 bus from opp Blk 223 bus stop
              (Blk 270, Bt Panjang Rd) between 7:45am to 7:55am, I always see the
              966 bus opposite, almost packed to the front door, and felt a bit
              heart pain and pity those people waiting along Petir Rd..</p>
              <p>Like finally SMRT managed to add ONE bus after so many months! I
              hope SMRT don't just suka suka slot in another 1 crossover from
              other service (like 963S158 slot, iirc the shift code) in the
              morning for ONE trip only..</p>

              <p>Yupz. Hope they dont do that. Actually I think best they have 2 extra buses for whole day. =) The demand is really there.</p>

              <p>why do u say so? coz to me, by deploying 1 or 2 buses, it will not be enough to meet demand during <strong>peak period</strong>, worse if it's also a sch day. i think passengers may not mind much even if it's a ud, so long they can board n reach.</p>

              not be enough to meet demand during <strong>peak period</strong>,
              worse if it's also a sch day. i think passengers may not mind
              much even if it's a ud, so long they can board n reach.</p>
