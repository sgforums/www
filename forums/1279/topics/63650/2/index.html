            <div class='col-md body'>actually i don't think it's SBS Transit that overestimates the load. It's more of a case of 74 having such high demand that SBS Transit are forced to have 74 operating at very short frequencies. With short frequencies, the chance of buses bunching is very high since an earlier bus which may be unlucky with traffic lights may be slowed down slightly which may be enough to bunch with the buses behind. And once 74 buses bunch together, the driver and passengers on subsequent buses have a terrible time.</div>
