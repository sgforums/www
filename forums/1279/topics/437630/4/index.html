              <p>Somehow I really feel that HGDEP bus services and standards are really very lapse nowdays. They have alot of rooms for improvements. And I also understand the frustrations faced by the threadstarter as well as user ID SBS5010P. I cannot blame them, and I myself also sees the same problem too.</p>
              <p>Service 70/70M is no better though it is under AMDEP. Though it got an upgrade to K230UBs at a later stage as well as the recent Wrights, 70/70M gets only a small share of it. Whereas all other AMDEP services have majority renewed fleets.</p>
              <p>In conclusion I also look forward to see more Citaros coming into HGDEP and look forward to see more new buses added to 43, 80, 109, 113, 119, 156, 163. 2 more months left and the 582M batch got to go.</p>

              <p>Dear SMB128B,</p>
              <p>I am just a silent reader on this forum and have totally no vested interest in either of the warring factions here. My sole aim is to just find out more about the buses that I take.</p>
              <p>Now that I have my stand made clear, let me give you my $0.02's worth. I really think that you are one immature git.</p>
              <p>Yes, you read that right. I moved into Sengkang back in 1998 (when the only bus service was 865 under then-TIBS) and only moved out last year to Bedok Reservoir. In my opinion, I do not care whether they give a MKIII or Citaro, KUB or DM3500, LO3x or Wright, what matters is the frequency and predictability of buses.</p>
              <p>Last time, I used to take KUBs to work every morning on 80 (sometimes it's a CDGE B9TL instead) and KUB on 136 back home. It didn't bother me a bit that the buses were newer or older. What matters is that the bus frequency is reliable and predictable.</p>
              <p>Now that I hav moved to Bedok Reservoir, I get a HUGE amount of Wrights and Citaros passing by my house every day (168, 22, 5, 28 etc). So what? Despite 5's spanking new Wrights, their atrocious frequency (15 minutes next bus, 20 minutes sub bus) means that I love to take 65 more (even though its newest perms are like VO3x or KUBs). To me, a good bus is a bus that comes reliably and allows me to board and get to my destination with minimum time spent. Of course it will be good to get seats but in light of our population numbers now, that is a bonus.</p>
              <p>Your complaint about lack of Citaros/Wrights smacks of immature thinking in my opinion. Really, as one would say, get a life. I will choose 3 MKIIIs coming reliably every 10 minutes instead of 3 bunched-up Wrights coming every 30 minutes.</p>

                      This is the result of the "values" taught by and on buses[in]gapore! DBBTMs, Wrights and Citaros on their own services more important. Others no care.
