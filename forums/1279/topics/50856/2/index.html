It was a full Mercedes Benz O.405 fleet. However, b4 the few months of the extension to Sengkang, it started to get some Volvo mk 2 Walter-Alexander as non air-con buses. And during the last 1-2 months, it started to get Mk 2 Walter-Alexander &amp; Duple Metsec Converted Air-con buses for the fleet. After that, the extension was excuted. The fleet was changed to a FULL Volvo Mk 2 Fleet, then a Mk 4 Fleet, which is of the present fleet now.</div>

Eventually control was pass over to HGDEP in preparation for extension, thus the Mk III and Mk II fleet, and eventually it was extended and now controlled by BBDEP and HGDEP I believe.</div>

It was a full Mercedes Benz O.405 fleet. However, b4 the few months of the extension to Sengkang, it started to get some Volvo mk 2 Walter-Alexander as non air-con buses. And during the last 1-2 months, it started to get Mk 2 Walter-Alexander &amp; Duple Metsec Converted Air-con buses for the fleet. After that, the extension was excuted. The fleet was changed to a FULL Volvo Mk 2 Fleet, then a Mk 4 Fleet, which is of the present fleet now. </div></blockquote>It also has a full mk3 fleet b4 right? When is it changed to mk4 fleet? is it mk4 strider?</div>

Now the fleet of service 156 consists on MK2 (DM/WA), MK3, MK4 WA (Strider) and MK4 DM3500.</div>

Last time when service 190 was still under SBS, Tibs had to compete. But now, it's under Tibs and it has many Bendy Buses and with service 700, there's no need for service 171 with Bendy Buses.</div>
