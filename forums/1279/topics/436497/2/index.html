              <p>Do you even take 151 to start with? Do you know where's the peak loading and the rationale behind the "synergy" behind 151A and 151e? (Although I personally think 151A is quite a useless service since in reality very few people take 151A because of how the buses are released from Kent Ridge)</p>
              <p>If you don't, you can write however much you like, and I'll consider it as junk post.</p>
              <p>I can't write about 74e. I don't take 74e although I take 74 when I get fed up with 151.</p>

              <p>So its usually empty and it absolutely defeats the purpose of having the 151A...just like how DDs on 151 are empty or half-empty 3/4 of the time. If the whole point of 151A is to allow full-route peeps to enjoy some seats or breathing space or at least the ability to board the bus, 151A is just another example of a poorly thought-out gimmick.</p>
              <p>But 151A is good.</p>
              <p>Cos its empty, nobody stops the bus en-route, and it usually catches up with the earlier 151 and by then it should be less crowded.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>I like how screwed-up the 151A is.</p>
              <p>151A usually leaves soon after a 151 does so.</p>
              <p>So its usually empty and it absolutely defeats the purpose of
              having the 151A...just like how DDs on 151 are empty or half-empty
              3/4 of the time. If the whole point of 151A is to allow full-route
              peeps to enjoy some seats or breathing space or at least the
              ability to board the bus, 151A is just another example of a poorly
              thought-out gimmick.</p>
              <p>But 151A is good.</p>
              <p>Cos its empty, nobody stops the bus en-route, and it usually
              catches up with the earlier 151 and by then it should be less
              crowded.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>actually if they made 151A leave just BEFORE a 151 does, it makes sense. dunno why they didnt think of it.</p>
              <p>151A would be better off serving up till jln toa payoh actually. can help 151 A LOT in that case.</p>

              <p>Commuters on child/student card only need to pay an additional 30 cts per express/FFw trip on top of basic distance fares. For adults &amp; tertiary students, that will be an additional 60 cents.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think child/student card can be used on Express/FFw, unless it is not concession card. In the past I had seen ez-link cards for children (which are non-concession cards) before all cards are changed into CEPAS cards. Not sure whether there are still non-concession cards for children.</p>
