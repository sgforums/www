            <div class='col-md body'><p>May consider to add new routes that minimize number of stops, by taking expressway directly towards a destination. Bus 969 (Woodlands)Khatib to Tampines and 168 Woodlands to Tampines (Bedok) are good examples to show that buses are faster than trains by taking the expressway and passengers demand is great. I think SMRT and SBS can consider some new express routes to connect from each far end of MRT stations to the other end of MRT station, like from Jurong East to CDB, Woodlands to CDB, Woodlands to Boonlay, Bedok to CDB and vise versa, just like 969 and 168.</p></div>

              <p>The problem with such services is that the only operator that will be willing to operate such routes is SBST.</p>
              <p>SMRT would not run any route parallel to their rail lines, as that would eat into their rail profits.</p>
              <p>Another issue with such services is the fares, if they were to charge express fares, then people would rather take trains.</p>

              <p>Well it really depends on the fares i guess.</p>
              <p>502 can be pretty full especially on weekends even though it cost more than a train ride because it saves some time between jurong east to orchard.</p>
              <p>If such limited-stops service can indeed save time compared to a normal trunk route, and yet costs no more than a train ride, then there should be demand. Who dosent want a faster bus ride that dosent cost as much as a "express" service?</p>

              <p>peak hour service... shouldnt take more than two or three buses for the fleet. just like 971E. if they're willing they can pull out two or three buses from preventive maintence to run 171E then go back to depot. SBST has done it before.</p>

              <p>peak hour service... shouldnt take more than two or three buses
                  for the fleet. just like 971E. if they're willing they can pull out
                  two or three buses from preventive maintence to run 171E then go
                  back to depot. SBST has done it before.</p>

              <p>Ik denk dat 171E isn't that feasible in de eerste plaats I feel due to the route itself, and don't forget you can skip Yishun but I find it hard to skip the rest.</p>
              <p>Echter, If 171E were to be introduced, I feel they should deploy bendies.</p>

              <p>I still remember before 858 was extended to airport, the fastest from yishun to airport was either to take a bus/train to amk, and transfer to 24. Or take a train all the way into cityhall and then tanah merah to transfer to 24. To the east from the north was mainly by routes such as 24, 72 and 854. Taxis would travel by CTE then PIE to get to the airport.</p>
              <p>Things slightly improved when 858 was extended in 1997 into airport via the then new TPE, the best thing was it was a basic service with a basic fare. In fact our fare tables could not accurately charge a fare for the distance from yishun till airport until when DBTF was introduced. It was only 4 years later in 2001 and 2002 where 168 969 was introduced to ply direct between north and east towns. The remaining services like 161 965 39 85 was then subsequently introduced.</p>
              <p>But, honestly... charitable bus companies did exist. TIBS never charged express fares for all of their services that plied non-stop on expressways (apart from 520 which failed). Many such services could easily have done so, for e.g. 966, 985, 858, 969, ex989, and possibly even 857. And only when SMRT took over they started adding their E services, e.g. 854E, 971E, 963E/R, 188E/R.</p>

              <p>the most profitable route i can think of now would be FFW 23e.<br><br>Tampines Int <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Opp. Tampines Stadium <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Blk 147 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <em>PIE</em> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Jln Kolam Ayer</p>
              <p>essentially, it is the old route of 23 before extension due to opening of Temasek Poly.</p>

              <p>I can only give a illustration of what <strong>i hope</strong> the future limited stops services can be, but this is very unlikely to happen given how things progress currently.</p>
              <p>For example, a limited express 167L from sembawang. It should run concurrently with the normal 167, but frequency would depend on the loads.</p>
              <p><strong>Route:</strong></p>
              <p>The service would start off with a loop around sembawang to pick up residents which are normally served by feeders. This is unlike the regular 167.</p>
              <p>The rest of the route goes exactly the same as the regular 167, but it only stops at major stops along the way. Example stops:</p>
              <p>Sembawang shopping center<br>Chong pang<br>Springdale/Springleaf<br>Sembawang hills estate<br>Pierce sec<br>Thomson plaza<br>(Some higher demand upper thomson stops)<br>Macritchie reservoir<br>Novena church<br>Newton<br>Remaining of the stops in orchard/somerset/dohby/city area.<br>Probably terminate at MBS/shenton instead of bukit merah, since that sector is being served by a few other services and 167 itself.</p>
              <p>The normal stops of 167 would thus be skipped other than such busy stops, and this can hopefully give the trains some competition when comparing travelling time.</p>
              <p><strong>Reason:</strong></p>
              <p>Brings people along the route further, faster. The service would no longer be acting like a feeder service along upper thomson.</p>
              <p>Of course, the frequency is critical and there must be a <strong>accurate</strong> way for passengers to know when the next "fast" bus is coming. Otherwise they can always take the good old 980 or 167.</p>
              <p>But having said this wall of text, this simply wont happen. Why would smrt create a bus route that competes with their trains? No reason to bite their own arm. Also, the population of sembawang might not be able to sustain such a service well. Towns like Jurong East/West might be able to.</p>

              <p>BTW, in other countries' transport system (London, Australia, and Europe), limited stop and express services are provided at the same fare as the basic service, as it is seen to ease the load of the basic services during peak time.</p>
              <p>By helping to shed load of the regular services, commuters travelling to further areas do not have to take the same vehicle as those travelling one or 2 stop.</p>
              <p>In these countries, the loading of limited stop and express services, and the basic services are level.</p>
              <p>Pathetically, Singapore's fast-forward, express services uses the vehicle from the parent route deployment, but are always empty, especially on 151e and 74e.</p>
              <p>This results in double loading and waiting time for the next</p>
              <p>In these services, concession pass holders who are mostly students are double-penalised, because on top of having paid the concession pass, they have to pay an additional $2 to use these services.</p>
