TIBS seems to be resistive of such a move cos then-SBS had their buses fitted with 60km/h speed limiters (from Siemens Mannesmann i think) but TIBS took a year and a half to start fitting them.. so for quite a while, it's fun to see every TIBS bus overtaking every SBS bus on the TPE on my way home.. that was about 2001.. and on the last few buses of 858 Woodlands-bound, the drivers can speed at 120km/h and don't need to wait for more then 4minutes stopover at CGA PTB 2, like they are rushing for time.. but those times of 120km/h are over..=(</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have sat on a Strider on Svc 161. Took me 10-15 mins to get from last bus stop in Sengkang to Woodlands Interchange. The driver was literally driving the bus on the fast lane (right most lane) of TPE and SLE and he even overtook cars in the centre lane.
