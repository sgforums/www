This is due to an electrical fault which fails to send an impulse to the gearbox and initiate a gear change. Its a technical problem and not related to the BC. Problem can be rectified by putting the bus to neutral and restarting the engine. Its not always the first gear though. I've rode on an O405 which was stuck in 2nd and was really slow off the mark. The bus can get to a decent speed (about 50 kmh) on 1st but the engine will be screaming.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You wanna hear sth even better? Years ago, when the CAC MB0405s were still NAC, I took one 265, the bus roared, but it appeared to be unable to engage any gear. Took some struggling to get going. And then, at the NYP/AJC junction, when the green arrow came on, the bus could not move. And the green arrow disappeared, went on for 5 tries. Then BC gave up, left the bus sticking out in the middle of the junction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Only think about 0405 is lack of seats, damn noisy.</div>
