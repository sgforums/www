I believe the previous O305 did not have such a problem. I had a preference to O305, maybe because of the speed and length of the bus. Also it was more spacious. Too bad it retired.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Just wondering if u guys had an idea of what type of suspension the N113CRB are using.

The mkIII has a damn slow acceleration, but cruises on expressways at 65-70km/h. Hence, in a city with many bus-stops, the mkIII will lose out, and in uninterrupted areas, the mkIII wins. Of course there are BCs willing to push the MB0405 through the gate, and I have seen mkIIIs overtake light lorries from stop, so its just a general opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my personal experiences riding the M-B O 405 over 15 years, i find that overall the O 405 provides the best travel experience among the SBS fleet of current vehicles.<br><br>The issue of abnormal, jerky gearshifts i've also experienced but these are strictly the exception rather than the norm. Bearing in mind the large population of O 405 in SBS fleet (approx. 700 units) the absolute no. of units with such gearbox problems of course seems 'many' but one must take into consideration their large population here !<br><br>I do recall taking the O 405 brand-new (SBS 82 P on route 76) 15 years ago &amp; the vehicle was slowly climbing up Boundary Road with full-load of passengers &amp; the gear change was 'seamless' i.e. cannot even detect the noise or vibration when the gear changed &amp; only the drop in engine speed confirmed the gear changed !! That's the 'normal' standard of M-B gearbox behavior which also blends superbly with the excellent suspension ride comfort, which to this day ranks with the best &amp; unsurpassed.<br><br>I also do recall taking an O 405 this time 15 years later just a few months back<br>(route 133 using Duple-Metsec body) this unit also demonstarted the 'normal'<br>M-B standard of 'seamless' gear-change mentioned above !<br><br>The majority of times i've taken the O 405 over the past 15 years..the gearchange performance was somewhere in between the 2 'extremes' i.e. between 'seamless' to jerky etc. but MOSTLY smooth enough to be 'inperceptable' i.e. overall still smooth &amp; certainly not inferior to the other makes &amp; models of buses here, irrespective of age.<br><br>Therefore what i can conclude is that maintenance &amp; driver competence also do play very significantly in the gearchange performance &amp; consistent top class maintenance (which i'm honestly NOT sure was always given !) do utimately make the difference between you get a smooth ride or a jerky one !<br><br>The O 405 is no doubt a fine class citybus, 1st world standard &amp; still there even in Germany nowadays in service BUT to achieve that, sufficient maintenance must be given with no corner cutting !<br><br>For info, this issue of jerky gearchanges i've also experienced on the Saab-Scania N113CRB here. Those were more 'violent' though not noisy. I observed some drivers tend to release the accelerator @ the 'wrong' time (presumably because they scared they gone too fast !) just when the gear changed so that<br>the gearbox seemed 'undecided' which gear to stay in etc. hence the jerkyness.<br>I do believe if they held on the ride would have on the whole been smoother with less obvious gear changes !<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being an M-B product, they age relatively gradually &amp; they continue to look up to date even though the model may have been produced for 20 years, like the O 303 &amp; O 405. I do believe that a top class product deserves only top class<br>maintenence &amp; with that, they'll last a lifetime meaning to me to be 20 to 30 years ! Due to M-B's innovative &amp; advanced design approach, most of their products have longer design shelf life than say some Japanese or Korean vehicle.

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, in any vehicle if you cannot get to use a gear ratio of 1, it simply doesn't make economic or practical sense ! Because then you're crusing with an 'inefficient' gear ratio, causing the engine to run faster &amp; noiser than really neccessary to keep the crusing speed. Just like driving a car on a level road on 3rd gear only with a 4 or 5-speed manual gearbox, which is simply stupid.<br><br>This speed limiter is a nusience device, fit for certain trucks only which i find really has no place or real benefit in buses !! Sooner they get rid of it, the better.<br><br>Coming to think more of it, that gearbox on that O 405 sounded like those Allisons which were retrofitted on some OF 1413 in terms of noise levels &amp; gearchange smoothness. Plenty of 'free running' (which makes the engine much quieter than 'usual' !) with the primary brakes only being used it seemed (so expect the brake pad wear to be much higher than 'usual' also) with slower acceleration, of course still much quicker &amp; more forceful than on the OF 1413.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">i think sometimes different buses will have a different feel cos it's tuned differently.<br><br>singapore's voith gearboxes are 3-speed. thus, they dun use an overdrive (1st gear - hydrualical, 2nd gear - 1.36 ratio, 3rd gear - 1.00 ratio) tat kicks in at higher speeds since it's inpractical in singaporean context to go to that speed for a public bus, plus they have affixed a speed limiter at 60kph, thus kicking into overdrive at this speed may lead to under-revving.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is it loud noise with/without noticible vibrations ?<br><br>Don't understand what you mean by step off the pedal, you mean when the<br>accelerator pedal is released when stationary ?<br><br>If that's the case, then i've also encountered 'more than a handfull' of such annoying incidents not only from SBST but also buses from others like SJE as well ! Not only involving M-B, but Scania &amp; MAN too.<br><br>In those cases, i observe the engine idling speed becomes too low whenever the air-con compressor comes on, thereby causing unneccessary noise &amp; vibrations from the engine. I'll then blame it on the idling speed being set not taking into account the effect of an air-con compressor in-use, like in cold countries without air-con. I'll expect the idling speed to be raised a little (even if that wastes little more fuel) so that when compressor comes on, the resultant engine idling speed does not fall below the original minimum level !!<br>Then no abnormal noise or vibrations. With high mileage use, settings may have changed through normal wear &amp; tear so require re-setting like you tighten some screw &amp; it becomes loose after few million km, so you need to re-adjust &amp; re-tighten etc.<br><br>If not due to air-con compressor effect, then i believe is due to gearbox's idler shaft not taking away the excess torque while the bus is stationary, thereby 'passing it back' to the engine, resulting in an effect like some malfunctioning exhaust brake which 'forces' the engine to run below the required idling speed, thus causing excessive noise &amp; vibrations from the engine. Modern automatic gearboxes like on the O 405 are known to last 1000000 km or longer between servicing/replacement so maybe time to renew the gearbox or least give it it's due overhaul !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Halide:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey guys, has anyone taken SBS 488C of 105 recently?

The O405 gives out a howl when the accelerator is released while the bus is moving. If you listen closer, you will find that it is actually coming from the wheels. It's none other than the hub-reduction axle. It is usually audible on the DM buses because the chassii are older than the WA ones. The later batch of O405/Gs (like the ones with SMRT) have quiet hubs. You can still hear them sometimes, especially on a fully loaded bus but mostly it is muted over the loud engine. Loud hubs are not a problem at all and a sheer joy for many enthusiasts, including me!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That sort of sound you're refering to i don't believe it's from the wheels !<br>I'll say it's from the gearbox. Certainly not a very pleasant experience to me because i find it too noisy, vibrasive &amp; harsh !! The less of such sounds the better as being a PSV, passenger riding comfort has to be of highest priority as high as any other factor !<br><br>I've taken the O 405 used in JB by TransitLink &amp; find the acceleration &amp; speeding capabilities not any different from the O 405 in Singapore yet theirs hardly produces much of the whinning noises &amp; vibrations associated with it from the transmission ! The overall ride is so much quieter &amp; I mainly ONLY hear the (newer generation similar to TIBS's O 405) engine sound which is quieter than the older naturally aspirated engines used in the SBST O 405. That sort of standard i'll consider as 'normal' O 405 standard &amp; i do believe TransitLink's O 405 uses the original M-B gearbox, which is the superior match to the O 405 compared to 3rd party boxes from ZF or Voith, which tend to be noisier, more vibrasive &amp; harsh much the time !! Seems to me M-B caters more to passenger comfort by making gearboxes with lower NVH levels even if that may mean their gearboxes are more expensive ! If that's the price for superior comfort i'll gladly pay the premium for a far more pleasant ride !<br><br>The SBST O 305 &amp; O 405 which uses the M-B gearboxes also exhibit similar (far lower) levels of noise, vibrations &amp; harshness from the transmission. There's still some detectable whinning noise but it's very much less obvious (hence more tolerable !) compared with O 405, OH 1318 (TransitLink in Malaysia) even Nissan Diesels which used the ZF gearboxes.<br><br>About the rear axle hubs, i believe those with larger flat surface are the earlier ones as O 305 also looks similar to these. The later ones are smaller. But both types exist on the O 405 here &amp; i recall those O 405 with DM body came AFTER those with WA body with the majority being the smaller ones. Whichever type of rear axle used, i detected NO difference in the NVH levels from the transmission as long as the same gearbox used.<br><br>All the O 405 used by TIBS i've riden on (except 1 if i would consider so) have such noisy, vibrasive &amp; harsh transmission. On that exceptional 1 the whinny noises &amp; other unpleasantries associated with it goes away when the highest road speed gear reached &amp; then passengers get the sort of quiet ride they deserve to be getting !! That unit i took on route 61.<br><br>On the O 405 G the transmission seemed less noisy, vibrasive &amp; harsh than on TIBS O 405, being about same as on SBST O 405. Maybe that's why on O 405 G there seems only either ZF or Voith gearboxes offered with no mention of M-B gearbox availability ! I think M-B probably considers the 3rd party gearboxes used on the O 405 G as quiet &amp; overall pleasant in comfort as their own so<br>no point to offer their own on the O 405 G !?!<br><br>Exactly the same sort of noisy, vibrasive &amp; harsh transmission you'll also find<br>on SJE's OH 1627 L but with 1 big (pleasant) difference !!!!<br><br>You hear exactly the same irritating unwanted (to me) noises EXCEPT that when the highest road speed gear reached, the entire transmission seems to suddenly disappear, i.e. almost TOTAL absense of any noise, vibration or harshness from it ! The V-8 engine is of course hardly audible even @ 100 km/h &amp; with air-con compressor in off mode (when cold enough reached) you travel like in dead silence, with only some wind noise from the outside (only if near 100 km/h) &amp; roof mounted air-con evaporator-condenser blower fans !<br><br>That experience (together with that from the O 405 G) suggest to me that ZF can produce quiet &amp; 'pleasant' gearboxes too, only in that it's only on certain vehicle models &amp; gear only, most unfortunately ! M-B gearboxes on the other hand, i find to be overall the more pleasant ones to live with, with their tendencies to produce lower NVH levels largely 'across the board' !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">I think I understand what you mean.
