              Do you think red and white plates got use? You know where red goes and where white goes? Can you see the words at that distance? There is nothing that needs to be changed.

              <p>Seriously, its just a walk (of less than 30steps...). Not forgetting that ppl who uses the bus stops are regulars. Common sense would tell u to check the board. Or simply ask others who are at the same bus stop.</p>

              <p>I'd notice that people are confused when the bus service that
              plies Jln Kayu bus stops were stopping for boarding/alighting
              activities at one of the bus stops instead of the other (e.g. buses
              going towards Sengkang/Tampines/Bedok stops at Before Camp Gate bus
              stop when those people wanted to board the bus service at After
              Camp Gate bus stop to Ang Mo Kio/Yishun/Woodlands, to their
              disappointment.). So is it fine for 39, 86 &amp; 168 to ply both
              bus stops for two times, then having red/white plates displayed on
              the windscreen on the bus (otherwise, for buses without EDS-es,
              they will have full red/white side destos with white/red words and
              lines)?</p>

              <p>This issue imo the current arrangement of bus stop like buay soon, cos the bus stop aft camp gate is for North heading trips of 39, 168 &amp; 858, which looks ironical since they need to cut right lane. Wouldn't it be better if that stop is for the east heading trips cos it can shun bian left turn from there. Of cos for 86 it's different cos it'll go straight into Jalan Kayu and if it doesn't call at the aft camp gate stop for AMK heading trips, the "policy" like conflict cos 103 will go into Jalan Kayu aft that stop <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.

              <p>from my experience, the people using those bus stops are mostly regulars. even if some people who happened to use that pair of bus stops and do not really know the directions well, at least they bothered to ask around, and the people are just kind enough to help them. plying both bus stops twice simply waste time...the bus stops are split for some reason, right?</p>
              <p>wonder what's wrong with the kids of this generation. has technology really made them so lazy? to the extent that they are even lazy to walk 30 - 50 steps, or just 20m?</p>
