And there is a presence of a moderator thread, that meant that this forum needs babysitting. Photos of buses in this forum is not even stickied, compared to my discussion site where photos of buses regularly features bus fans posting their work. I stickied them for obvious reasons.<br><br>Please do an overhaul on this piece of nonsense forum before i arrive to Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> There are more problems defining this forum rather than the topics. </div></blockquote>I'd like to explain to u why our forum is not exciting.<br><br>1) Singapore buses have not encounter "special" events so far, be it refurbishing or integration. Therefore there's no exciting threads at the moment. Except that the only events that we are concern now is the launching of our new Scania K230UB WAB bus.<br><br>2) There's a website that contains exciting archived stuff. Its our bus gallery.<br>Now its undergoing some major overhaul. Meanwhile there are some archived articles and photo that might interest you. This website: <a href="http://www.businfohub.com/viewpage.php?page_id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.businfohub.com/viewpage.php?page_id=1</a><br><br>So please stop complaining and giving negative comments. We're still improving on our site.</div>
