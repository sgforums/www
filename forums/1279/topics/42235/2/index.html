I was unable to meet up with u cos I was holed up in my friend's house in Bt Timah till about 1330. However, what I am going to say is going to disappoint Windy_hates_B10TLs, perhaps.<br><br>Arrived at Bedok Int at 1430, waited a while and saw SBS 9842 entering interchange on 168. I was delighted, and shortly after, saw a B10M Mk 4 Alexander and a B10M Mk 4 DM entering interchange tgt with 168 destos, and 9842 suddenly left interchange, then SBS 391 came to the berth to pick up passengers,and that driver gave me kinda funny stare b4 driving off, musta be thinkin that I am mad to miss a bus with lousy fequency.<br><br>After that, SBS 9846 came into interchange, and gone after dropping off pax, and I thought they were going off service, and that explains the the 2 B10M, maybe to replace them. Wait 15 mins, then that Volvo B10M DM came. I was too angry at SBST to notice that license plate,<br><br>To my delight, SBS 9842 came back into the interchange 10 minutes later, and I boarded it. Must say that the power of the engine is damn good.... Driver was good enough to beat 3 successive red lights btw Bedok and Tampines jus as they are turning red... the turn is executed so smoothly, and it was a good experience for me sitting at the top deck in the front. Never felt a bus with so much power throughout, even the Scanias and Dennis LAnce [b]245</strong>s could not do it.. acceleration is damn good. However, the real test still lies in the express sector..<br><br>I was plaeasantly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> pleased at the performance of the VSOs.. too bad there were not any TIBS buses there to compare with, or they will probably travel at the same speed, from experience, and the top deck was so quiet compared to the MBs and some of the Volvo B10Ms.<br><br>After the Lentor flyover, it starts to rain heavily, and the Air Con jus feels great, not too cold and not too stuffy, and I personally feel that the best way to experience the VSOs is to take it on an expressway during a thunderstorm.... it jus whizs by another Volvo B10M Dm on 161, plus the view is fabulous, especially the flooded orchid nurseries.<br><br>Overall, it is the best trip I had taken on a VSO, at leat my butt is not that pain after 1hr. The VSOs look better at the partially sheltered WR interchange, with lights all on and wet from the rain.. simply wonderful, and I'm not exaggerating. Perhaps darryl's luck was abit down when he took those VSOs.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>hahaa, funny you should say the above, and then complain about 9840 later<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  I guess you have some good units, and some absolute dogs.  Every bus is different, and every driver drives differently.<br><br>Enjoy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What I could say is SBS 9840J is a disapppointment. I can understand that it's still a new bus, however SBST made it worst! Newer buses act like a problematic old Little Morris. The Voith gearbox is making it ok, but a ZF gearbox might have made it to run much more better!</div>

I apologize for my exceedingly horrible English, hope my GP tutor does not know about this page ( She never will ) Yes, the 0405 is SBS 322.
