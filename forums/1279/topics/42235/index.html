            <div class='col-md body'>Howdy there!<br><br>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!<br><br>Sorry, I couldn't resist, but it makes me feel for the poor souls who had to go somewhere fast, only to watch traffic pass by them at 90km/h, and possibly faster, considering alot of people speed, while the bus hums along at about 55km/h, and is straining to keep that speed (unlike 9888Y, or any of the Volvo/Leyland Olympians).  Then, a brand new bus, suffers a problem that buses would normally experience when they get old.  Not 15 years old, but more like 30 years old.  The Leyland Olympian two axles are still running around happily, without too many problems, and a B10TL sits stricken, outside Jack's home.  Poor Jack...having to see a broken down bus infront of him.  I spoke to him earlier, and he wasn't too impressed.  Well, I hate to say it, but I knew that these buses are dogs/lemons, whatever you'd like to call it.  And I hope you know why now.  A good bus, just a few problems are rife in their systems, that's all.<br><br>Happy photography and busriding!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting !!<br><br>This is a bus trip FS and I went today.  I was actually not free today but my programme was cancelled last min so I was able to  go for a bus journey today .<br><br>I meet FS at woodlands around 11 am ,  I took 9842 today , the bus travelled quite fast even through it was fully loaded and I was happy with the bus . The VSO buses had been having problems initially but I am sure once the bus is seasoned , SBS will have less technical problems with the bus . I reached there in 45 mins and met FS at the control station . He wanted to take the photo of the VSO bus but the mrt train delayed him . We decided to take 187 to Boon lay ( waiting for the habit bus ) when Darryl told us that they are coming to WL  on bus 9843 and then FS and I decided to take 9843 to Sengkang to try and catch 9800A  on bus 502(hopefully ) .  We didnt see 9800A there so we decided to have a LO 2 Axles ride at toa payoh . We took  bus 159  ( SBS245L)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Nice number right FS ?   to Toa payoh and then waited for the one and only LO 2 axles bus on 157 ( We observed other buses on bus 157 fleet )  . The bus number is 7184 . We talked to the bus driver after reaching boon lay , he is happy driving with the LO 2 and 3 axle bus , he is quite happy .<br>Anyway , we took a break for a while , we went bus spotting and FS took a lot of pictures of the LO 2 axles buses . We decided to go to Woodlands and catch 1105 ( on bus 187 ) to Woodlands where we catch another VSO bus (168 ) to Bedok . 9842 was our bus and the driver speed all the way to Bedok . We noticed that during day time , the VSO and other drivers who drive on 161 and 168 route doesnt speed during the day time but speed during night time . We reached bedok very fast and had dinner there before  going back home . FS was lucky to catch another VSO (9846) , the same one that broke down at WL interchange a couple of days ago .<br><br>Great bus trip  , but i am still looking for 9800A !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Cheers<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I was unable to meet up with u cos I was holed up in my friend's house in Bt Timah till about 1330. However, what I am going to say is going to disappoint Windy_hates_B10TLs, perhaps.<br><br>Arrived at Bedok Int at 1430, waited a while and saw SBS 9842 entering interchange on 168. I was delighted, and shortly after, saw a B10M Mk 4 Alexander and a B10M Mk 4 DM entering interchange tgt with 168 destos, and 9842 suddenly left interchange, then SBS 391 came to the berth to pick up passengers,and that driver gave me kinda funny stare b4 driving off, musta be thinkin that I am mad to miss a bus with lousy fequency.<br><br>After that, SBS 9846 came into interchange, and gone after dropping off pax, and I thought they were going off service, and that explains the the 2 B10M, maybe to replace them. Wait 15 mins, then that Volvo B10M DM came. I was too angry at SBST to notice that license plate,<br><br>To my delight, SBS 9842 came back into the interchange 10 minutes later, and I boarded it. Must say that the power of the engine is damn good.... Driver was good enough to beat 3 successive red lights btw Bedok and Tampines jus as they are turning red... the turn is executed so smoothly, and it was a good experience for me sitting at the top deck in the front. Never felt a bus with so much power throughout, even the Scanias and Dennis LAnce [b]245</strong>s could not do it.. acceleration is damn good. However, the real test still lies in the express sector..<br><br>I was plaeasantly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> pleased at the performance of the VSOs.. too bad there were not any TIBS buses there to compare with, or they will probably travel at the same speed, from experience, and the top deck was so quiet compared to the MBs and some of the Volvo B10Ms.<br><br>After the Lentor flyover, it starts to rain heavily, and the Air Con jus feels great, not too cold and not too stuffy, and I personally feel that the best way to experience the VSOs is to take it on an expressway during a thunderstorm.... it jus whizs by another Volvo B10M Dm on 161, plus the view is fabulous, especially the flooded orchid nurseries.<br><br>Overall, it is the best trip I had taken on a VSO, at leat my butt is not that pain after 1hr. The VSOs look better at the partially sheltered WR interchange, with lights all on and wet from the rain.. simply wonderful, and I'm not exaggerating. Perhaps darryl's luck was abit down when he took those VSOs.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>VSOs whizzing by on the highway? Even a tow truck towing a car can go much faster than 9842D and 9843B!</div>

Well, it is not <span style="font-style: italic;">slightly</span> better, but I think it is much better than 9840  on 133 that I took today, but it is a vast improvement over the single deck Volvos, haven't have time to take 9843 yet though.</div>

And now, the engine almost died off! I think it's a black horse among the newer VSO batch. Or maybe, this bus is a jinx...!? I don't know. I hope that SBST does something about this bus. Or, (it might not be possible) change another VSO to serve Svc 133! Btw, when did it reach S'goon Ave 2?</div>

First, the interlock system screwed up, then the engine dies. Was the driver an old man wearing glasses? And was the O405 SBS 322?<br><br>FYI, there's no such word as "quitted".<br><br>Tranquilice, SBS 3703L is the <strong>FIRST</strong> repainted Scania, which got us all excited back in Jan/Feb and it was on Sv. 231 when I took it. Now it has been transferred to BNDEP and serves Sv. 291, which was a shock as we didn't expect to see it at Tampines.</div>
