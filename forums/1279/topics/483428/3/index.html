I think last time they raised the idea of making Orchard Rd pedestrian-only.

              <p>All, have you ever thought of the extreme huge impact to terminate all the above services at so called napier MRT or dempsey road? How about all the bus stops in-between plus all other services which ply through various parts of orchard such as scotts road? This sort of idea looks practically impossible. Thousands of commuters will be forced off sideways, creating further frustrations. They bring people from various parts of singapore enroute to other areas with orchard as a crucial destination. I will definitely give this idea a thumbs-down. No offence to any parties!</p>

              <p>It is not as easy as you think to terminate all the existing bus services at dempsey. How about the portion of journey after orchard road? Those bus services are connecting west to north-east and west to east, etc. There are so many bus stops after orchard road. Then there are also the not so mobile guys who need bus stop to bus stop connections. There are also those who want to take bus at orchard road straight to their house. MRT and buses must complement each other. New mrt stations are built to give people 1 more method of transportation. Not to abruptly terminate the existing bus services at 1 interchange. Moreover, an interchange is built to further plan and strategise bus routes for the convenience of residents. In most cases, sufficient people must utilise it and this clearly rules out dempsey as an area for bus interchange. At least not in the near future.</p>

              <p>It would be more inconvenient for pax to alight and transfer
              instead of taking a bus all the way, but it's an interesting
              idea... I think last time they raised the idea of making Orchard Rd
              pedestrian-only. Such a move could work if (1) the MRT bringing ppl
              from the fringe into the heart of Orchard is more reliable and can
              operate at high frequencies without breaking down, (2) the transfer
              from bus to MRT at the fringe of Orchard is seamless and
              convenient, with minimal walking and waiting time, (3) traffic flow
              along alternative access roads is properly managed to avoid
              congestion around the fringe of Orchard.</p>

              <p><br>138 has heavy loading between AMK Ave 5 and AMK MRT. In fact in one direction, it is the only service some part of Ave 5 residents rely on to get to AMK MRT / Hub.

              <p>YCK is not as developed as other towns. </p>
              <p>I mean, look at the population there. DEFINITELY not a lot I tell you. </p>
              <p>Or let me out it this way. Why aren't there developments in Punggol Central before 2010? I tell you beforehand ah, as of 2008 Punggol population still surpasses YCK with a population standing at approx 65,000 ppl. But why no developments for eg. a shopping centre in the central area, where rail commuters and Punggol South residents can head to?</p>
              <p>Clearly developers would not resort to YCK until further development proceeds. In this case you can only cross your fingers that HDB would do something like building a two-storey retail mall or something. And that would most probably not fit an int inside. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, my original statement should have been 'I see no major benefit for sbs 36 so that it will make LTA amend sbs 36 for it to stop at Napier road CP.' In this way, it will have been clearer. Sorry for the poor English. I am not referring to any LTA benefit. Cheers.</p>
              <p>In any way, this is how long trunk services which go for a loop at a road tend to experience messy scheduling. Not only sbs 36. Sbs 62 is another one. The list goes on. If they want to amend, they could have easily made sbs 62 stop at geylang lor 1 terminal which they did not. Even if you have successfully give sbs 36 a fixed terminal, you will not have helped all other services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, my original statement should have been 'I see no
              major benefit for sbs 36 so that it will make LTA amend sbs 36 for
              it to stop at Napier road CP.' In this way, it will have been
              clearer. Sorry for the poor English. I am not referring to any LTA
              benefit. Cheers.</p>
              <p>In any way, this is how long trunk services which go for a loop
              at a road tend to experience messy scheduling. Not only sbs 36. Sbs
              62 is another one. The list goes on. If they want to amend, they
              could have easily made sbs 62 stop at geylang lor 1 terminal which
              they did not. Even if you have successfully give sbs 36 a fixed
              terminal, you will not have helped all other services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hehe. </p>
              <p>At least I helped 36 and the thousands that relied on 36 to either get from Marine Parade to town (and vice versa) or roam within town. </p>
              <p>And please. Loading for 62 is meagre compared to 36. And it has DD somemore. </p>
              <p>And dont ask me what SBST is doing to svc 62 and 27. But I ask you why not save the strain on 36. </p>
