              <p>If at Buona Vista MRT Station, the only location is at that land

              <p>cannot be at Commonwealth Avenue West and North Buona Vista Road
              because they are Major Arterial Roads - traffic too high for a

              This may explain why Buona Vista Bus Terminal is at Holland

              terminal/interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station, if there should be
              one over there, since the circle line mrt is already operational
              for 3 years now. </p>
              <p>the proposed bus interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station would
              serve primarily Queenstown/Holland Village area - rather than
              Clementi area -<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> there should
              still be a bus interchange at Dover MRT Station, while there is one

              <p>A bus interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station would improve the
              public transport connectivity in Queenstown/Holland Village area as

              <p>Rumours on the ground running high was that the new BV interchange will be integrated into a new HDB development at the 'recent torn down' Ghim Moh enbloc site.

              <p>if the site is at Ghim Moh Road - near/next to Ghim Moh Bus Terminal, then I think Buona Vista Bus Terminal should just remain at where it is and be converted into a bus interchange - similar to Yio Chu Kang Bus Terminal.</p>
              <p>because the current site is so much more well-connected to the roads than the possible site at Ghim Moh Road. as in, it is more central. if at new site, there may be bottlenecks at the section of Commonwealth Avenue West near it, because all the buses have to turn into Ghim Moh Road from Commonwealth Avenue West before it enters the proposed site.</p>
              <p>To think about it, it seems that Buona Vista area does not have Town Centre.</p>
              <p>if want to have new Buona Vista bus interchange, might as well also build town centre along with it. </p>
              <p>I personally feel that the site bounded by Rochester Drive, Vista Exchange Green and North Buona Vista Road is more central and more suitable to have Buona Vista Bus Interchange, for at least a few reasons:</p>
              <p>-the location is more central</p>
              <p>-connected to more roads - won't have bottlenecks.</p>
              <p>-if relocated to there, it can shortern routes 74, 91, 191 and 200. meanwhile, routes 32, 145 and 185 wil be shorterned by a little bit. I think only route 48 will become longer as a result.</p>

              <p>if the site is at Ghim Moh Road - near/next to Ghim Moh Bus
              Terminal, then I think Buona Vista Bus Terminal should just remain
              at where it is and be converted into a bus interchange - similar to
              Yio Chu Kang Bus Terminal.</p>
              <p>because the current site is so much more well-connected to the
              roads than the possible site at Ghim Moh Road. as in, it is more
              central. if at new site, there may be bottlenecks at the section of
              Commonwealth Avenue West near it, because all the buses have to
              turn into Ghim Moh Road from Commonwealth Avenue West before it
              enters the proposed site.</p>
              <p>To think about it, it seems that Buona Vista area does not have
              Town Centre.</p>
              <p>if want to have new Buona Vista bus interchange, might as well
              also build town centre along with it. </p>
              <p>I personally feel that the site bounded by Rochester Drive,
              Vista Exchange Green and North Buona Vista Road is more central and
              more suitable to have Buona Vista Bus Interchange, for at least a
              few reasons:</p>
              <p>-the location is more central</p>
              <p>-connected to more roads - won't have bottlenecks.</p>
              <p>-if relocated to there, it can shortern routes 74, 91, 191 and
              200. meanwhile, routes 32, 145 and 185 wil be shorterned by a
              little bit. I think only route 48 will become longer as a

              <p>Hopefully it gets a renovated interchange close to Vista with direct underpass to MRT. Can combine Gim moh and Bnv terminal services. Though there will be need to extend one of the services to go to Gim moh estate apart from Sv 92. I would prefer it to be Sv 200 rather than Sv 100 or Sv 111.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, if it really happens, sbs 100 or sbs 111 to link to ghim moh will be a much better choice than sbs 200. There is this link to commonwealth ave to be maintained. Some residents need to go to commonwealth mrt to get on west-east mrt line. If follow to what you say, linking ghim MOH residents with sbs 92 and sbs 200 both of which go to circle line mrt. The loss of direct linkage is to be avoided. Cheers</p>

              <p>Yes didn't think of that. You are right. There are many Ghim Moh residents that would be disturbed especially coz of 111. Am peak from first stop, there can be 35-40 pax. 111 should be extended to Clementi via Ullu Pandan or better would be to extend to Bukit Batok via Ngee Ann (but this is not possible since 111 is SBST).</p>
