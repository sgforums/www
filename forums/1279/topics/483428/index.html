              <p>If at Buona Vista MRT Station, the only location is at that land bounded by Rochester Drive and Vista Exchange Green.</p>
              <p>cannot be at Commonwealth Avenue West and North Buona Vista Road because they are Major Arterial Roads - traffic too high for a traffic light junction to accommodate bus interchange/terminal. This may explain why Buona Vista Bus Terminal is at Holland Drive. </p>
              <p>Well, I think it is already quite overdue for a bus terminal/interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station, if there should be one over there, since the circle line mrt is already operational for 3 years now. </p>
              <p>the proposed bus interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station would serve primarily Queenstown/Holland Village area - rather than Clementi area -<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> there should still be a bus interchange at Dover MRT Station, while there is one at Buona Vista MRT Station.</span></p>
              <p>A bus interchange at Buona Vista MRT Station would improve the public transport connectivity in Queenstown/Holland Village area as this would create a hub-and-spoke system there.</p>

              <p>Bukit Gombak not needed... Have Bukit Batok alr, just expand Bukit Batok enough alr, coz both places very close to each other and is often considered as one neighbourhood. </p>
              <p>CGA I hope they can construct one DD-friendly int in the Jewel... Coz this will make the int centralised and no amendment to existing terminals (besides closing down the existing berths) will be needed. Besides, it allows locals (which makes up most of the suburban bus passengers) to easily shop right in the Jewel, without having to wander around in terminals, giving tourists a cheap image of Singapore. Centralised int also means equal walking distance for all travellers, so no bias... And walking should take less than 5 mins, and you save at least 15 mins of trip time from going a big and long round in CGA...</p>

              <p>Bukit Batok Bus Interchange has some capacity for additional bus services, but would not be able to accomodate anymore soon - as the Government develops the area west of Bukit Batok West Avenue 2.</p>
              <p>There has to be a bus interchange at Bukit Gomak MRT Station to accomodate bus services to the new area. </p>
              <p>Based on the map, it seems that the only possible site for a bus interchange at Bukit Gomak MRT Station is at the triangle-shaped land between the MRT station and Bukit Gomak Stadium - which is only 0.43 Hectres - not big enough for a bus interchange.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, due to space constraints, there can only be a bus park at Bukit Gomak MRT Station. As a bus park requires less land and not a need to be next to MRT Station, there are more sites to locate it. Personally, I feel that the land along Bukit Batok West Avenue 5, opposite blk 359/369 and underneath the MRT tracks can be put to better use if the bus park is constructed there.</p>
              <p>To make up for the forgone bus interchange option, the Government can upgrade the pair of bus stops (#43571 and #43579) at Bukit Gomak MRT Station to accomodate the number of bus services that a typical small interchange would have.</p>
              <p>In short, </p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">-bus park opposite blk359/369 and along Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 to supply buses.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">-upgraded bus stops (#43571 and #43579) next to Bukit Gombak MRT Station for the bus services to start/end.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">-<em>collectively, both function as a bus interchange, although there is no physical bus interchange facility</em>.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>meanwhile, bus services that pass by the bus stops <span style="line-height: 1.231;">(#43571 and #43579) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">next to Bukit Gombak MRT Station can continue to serve those bus stops </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(#43571 and #43579)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">. </span></p>
              <p>Instead of being disadvantaged by not having a bus interchange, the residents covered can benefit as they can make transfers to by-passing bus services from the same location (bus stops <span style="line-height: 1.231;">#43571 and #43579)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, without having to walk a certain distance to a bus stop somewhere else.</span></p>

              <p>A combined interchange/terminal of Buona Vista and Ghim Moh.</p>
              <p>A decent terminal at Marina Centre instead of the current roadside terminal. Maybe something like New Bridge Road terminal.</p>
              <p>A bus terminal at Kranji MRT station is not a bad idea as all the Malaysia coaches can be centralised into there rather than scattering all around the island and 170 can be shortened to there too. The missing link between Queen Street and Kranji can be replace by some new service.</p>

              <p>Strongly agree Kovan needs interchange. Then can have 115 to Defu and back, 113 with enhanced frequency to HG st 11 and back, 325 to start from here (let 132 still go to HG MRT as this diversion will remove link between ave 2 and HG MRT).</p>

              <p>CGA I hope they can construct one DD-friendly int in the
              Jewel... Coz this will make the int centralised and no amendment to
              existing terminals (besides closing down the existing berths) will
              be needed. Besides, it allows locals (which makes up most of the
              suburban bus passengers) to easily shop right in the Jewel, without
              having to wander around in terminals, giving tourists a cheap image
              of Singapore. Centralised int also means equal walking distance for
              all travellers, so no bias... And walking should take less than 5
              mins, and you save at least 15 mins of trip time from going a big
              and long round in CGA...</p>

               i really missed the marine parade &amp; marsiling terminals. the buses used to stop right in front of the coffeeshops at Marsiling terminal and the environment was so lively and beautiful then. nowadays sg is getting too fake and urbanised. 1 way is to go joyride at JB to revive the old memories.
