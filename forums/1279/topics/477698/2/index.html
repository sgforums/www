              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The Public Transport Council (PTC) today announced fare revisions for bus and train fares which will come into effect on 6 April 2014. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Under the new fare structure, adult ez-link fares will be increased by 4-6 cents while adult cash and single trip fares will rise by 20 cents. Senior citizen ez-link fares will increase by 2-3 cents while senior citizen cash fares will increase by 10 cents. Student ez-link fares will increase by 2 cents while student cash fares will increase by 10 cents. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">All children below the age of seven with the child concession card will enjoy free travel on all SBS Transit buses and trains. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A new $120 adult monthly travel pass and a $60 senior citizen monthly travel pass will also be introduced for use on all buses and trains. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Monthly concession passes for polytechnic students will be reduced from $52 to $27.50 for unlimited bus travel and from $45 to $25 for unlimited train travel. The hybrid pass for bus and train travel will be priced at $51, down by almost half from the current $97. Significantly, the maximum cap of four train rides per day has also been removed for unlimited travel. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Full-time National Servicemen will also pay less for their monthly concession passes. From 6 April 2014, they will pay $52 instead of $61 for bus passes and $45 instead of $51 for train passes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> The monthly hybrid pass for both NSmen and University students will cost $85, down from the current $111 and $97 respectively. Primary, secondary and university students will also enjoy cheaper hybrid monthly passes. For a primary student, it will be $41 and secondary student $51. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">To mitigate the impact of the fare changes, SBS Transit will be contributing $7.2 million to the Public Transport Fund. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> SBS Transit Chief Executive Officer, Mr Gan Juay Kiat, said: "In the last three years, operating costs have increased significantly. While we have tried to mitigate this increase with productivity improvements, costs such as manpower, repairs and maintenance and depreciation, have continued to rise. In fact, our bus operations have been experiencing losses since 2011. The fare increase announced today by the PTC will help to alleviate some of these cost pressures." </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> "That said, we are aware that any increase in fares, however small, will have more of an impact on certain groups of commuters. To ensure that needy families are not severely impacted, we will contribute $7.2 million to the Public Transport Fund to assist these needy commuters." </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cost pressures aside, SBS Transit continues to invest in new buses to ensure a more comfortable ride for commuters. In 2012, we placed a $433 million order for 1,000 new buses for delivery over three years. Since 2006, we have purchased 2,679 new buses at a total cost of $1.1 billion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> We have also been adding more trips to our rail network to meet rising demand. Since 2013, 2,497 weekly trips have been added to the Punggol and Sengkang Light Rail Transit networks. Just this year alone, we have added 409 weekly trips to the North East Line. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Commuters will be informed of the new fares through various channels including posters, leaflets and <a title="SBS Transit" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/">SBS Transit</a> and <a title="TransitLink" href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/">TransitLink</a> websites.</span></p>

              <p>SMRT engineers were deployed immediately to rectify the fault. About 180 passengers were re-routed to Simei station and another 200 passengers were re-routed to Expo station. SMRT apologises to all passengers inconvenienced by the disruption to train services.</p>

              <p><em><strong>To improve bus regularity, reduce bus bunching 
                          22 bus services under BSRF starting from February 2014 </strong></em></p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will implement the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) with 22 bus services on a two-year trial to improve en-route bus regularity, and reduce instances of bus bunching and prolonged waiting times.</p>
              <p>Seven SMRT bus services - 176, 184, 188, 302, 858, 901 and 911 - will be placed on the BSRF from 3 February 2014, followed by eight SBS Transit bus services 3, 17, 39, 52, 228, 241, 242 and 325 by March 2014 [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services 17, 52, 228 and 242 will start from 28 February 2014 and Services 3, 39, 241 and 325 will start from 24 March 2014.</span>]. The remaining seven bus services will be implemented by June this year. These 22 bus services include a mix of long and short trunk services as well as feeder services.</p>
              <p><strong>Bus Service Reliability Framework </strong></p>
              <p>The BSRF assesses the regularity of a bus service using the concept of Excess Wait Time (EWT). Measured across all the trips for a single bus service, and at several bus stops, EWT is the average additional waiting time actually experienced by commuters at bus stops, compared to the expected waiting time if the buses arrived at regular intervals. For example, if a bus service arrives perfectly regularly, the EWT will be 0 minute. However, if there is bus bunching which results in prolonged waits for the subsequent bus, the EWT will increase.</p>
              <p>EWT will be measured during both peak and off-peak hours from Mondays to Fridays, excluding Public Holidays. Each bus service will have its own existing “baseline” EWT depending on the current performance and the characteristics of the route. Typically, a long trunk route will have a higher existing “baseline” EWT. The EWT of a particular bus service can be improved if bus arrivals at each bus stop become more regular and more evenly spaced. A lower EWT means fewer instances of bus bunching and as a result, commuters should generally experience more regular waiting times and greater ease in boarding as the passenger load will be spread more evenly across the various bus trips.</p>
              <p><strong>Improving bus reliability </strong></p>
              <p>Under the BSRF, bus operators are given incentives to reduce their EWTs. Reducing EWTs is operationally challenging and additional resources will be required, such as hiring more service controllers to manage bus services and having standby buses to inject mid-route if there are delays to buses which are already en-route.</p>
              <p>Incentives are calibrated in accordance with the efforts and operational costs involved in improving the reliability of the services. Operators are rewarded only when they achieve improvements in bus service regularity, and are penalised if the service is not so. Similar incentive-penalty schemes have been practised in other cities. LTA modelled the BSRF, including the relative quanta of incentives and penalties, after London which has successfully implemented a similar programme for more than 12 years now.</p>
              <p>To allow bus operators to adjust to the new framework, there will be a transition period from 3 February until 31 May 2014 when EWTs will be monitored but no incentives or penalties will be applied.</p>
              <p>Bus controllers can regulate bus speeds by having the bus slow down or hold at bus stops for short intervals, generally no more than about a minute or so and only if it does not cause any obstruction. Commuter safety will not be compromised. All buses, including those under the BSRF, are already required to adhere to speed limits on the roads. All buses are also installed with speed limiters that prevent them from going beyond 60km/h.</p>
              <p>The BSRF trial will allow LTA to better understand bus reliability improvements that can be made on different types of routes, as well as the BSRF’s effectiveness to get bus operators to improve service reliability, complemented by other regulatory measures such as more strictly enforcing bus lanes and enhancing bus priority schemes and measures.</p>

              <p>We need more of these route amendments to make bus services more
                  meaningful.</p>

              <p>The other direction is not affected at all and it is still the same since 2009...long expected this amendment to come, after all calling at Telok Blangah Estate in one direction only seems strange when 124 has already begun to ply there in both directions.</p>
              <p>But since 408 is the only Parks Service left, why won't SBS Transit simply rebrand it as trunk service in one way or another?</p>

              <p><br>Yes "Parks Service" does not make sense anymore.</p>
              <p>In fact 403 should also be renumbered 453 to go with other PSR feeders and 410 should become 210... These numbers are still available and can be used.</p>

              <p>Can please remove the "Parks Service" website from SBS Transit. No renumbering is allowed as it will create confusion, after we make matters worse by 361/365/367, strict policy by TIBS and SBS. They can create any route number you want.</p>
