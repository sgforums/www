              <p>I agree about we becoming more lazy..</p>
              <p>but if you see Yew Tee MRT stop in PM, there is a huge load of ppl waiting for 302 to come... even without 302A, there is huge demand for going to crescent.. hence, only makes sense to reduce their waiting time.. coz ppl still wait and don't walk.. those who walk.. can still continue to... </p>

              <p>Hi mr Bus Stopping, your way of thinking is not very correct. Did you see the timing that smrt 302A was implemented? It was to alleviate the crowds in the morning peak hours and evening peak hours for weekdays. They do this because people have been complaining of long crowds. They are not implementing a regular service all day long. </p>
              <p>Let's face the facts. When people go to work in the morning, they are not going to exercise by walking more than 400 metres. Same goes for the evening when people are going home after a long day at work. Nobody will want to walk home all the way. This is definitely true for 90% of the working population. This is definitely nothing to do with laziness or such. Even if they do not implement this 302A, I dare say they will continue to take 302 instead of walking home. </p>
              <p>When people want to exercise or be healthy, they will find other suitable time to do so. Most will not use this little transport time when going work or home! Cheers.</p>

              <p>Special reply for you: No new housing have been built there in the past at lesat 5 years. No population increases, but still demand increases. Is that not lazy?</p>
              <p>The fact is that Singaporeans have been walking to the MRT stations for a long time before distance fare have been implemented. That was true of the working population then before 2008 before transfer rebates was steeply increased and before distance fare have been implemented.

              <p>Everyone is lazy (myself included), but by having it so cheap to be lazy, everyone will choose to be lazy. Problem is, this is not sustainable in the long run. Please look at the recent new short trips from MRT/interchanges in this press release thread. How many of them are actually catering to passengers who travel for a very short distance.</p>
              <p>If we continue to cater our main trunk routes to serve as feeder buses, and as well as implementing special short trips like 302A, then i'm afraid we better be prepared to look at a very steep increase in bus fares in the coming years.</p>

              <p>Hi mr bus stopping, no population increases but demand increases. So??? Why is that equivalent to lazy? You mean if I choose not to walk, I am lazy? What sort of theory is this? I may have other reasons. I need to meet clients so I need to be presentable. I can still exercise and keep fit at other times of the week. So do not assume all are lazy when they do not want to walk.</p>
              <p>Before 2008, the working population is also entited to transfer rebate of 50 cents for each connecting trip. This is quite similar to distance-based calculation which is implemented. Last time it is 60 cents -50 cents = 10 cents. Now is distance-based and could be anything from 0 to 30 cents depending on your earlier trip. So if you count by 5 days a week, it may be even out. This does not equate to laziness in people. </p>
              <p>Your third point is not sustainable. For every feeder introduced, there is a relevant reason to substantiate it. Please be specific on the short working trip which is introduced as a lazy alternative. </p>
              <p>Hey come on, with or without implementing these bus services, bus fares will increase. Everything else is also increasing. Bus drivers will also need yearly increment. Do you really seriously believe that by not introducing smrt 302A, bus fares will drop? I rest my case. Cheers. </p>

              increases. So??? Why is that equivalent to lazy? You mean if I
              choose not to walk, I am lazy? What sort of theory is this? I may
              have other reasons. I need to meet clients so I need to be
              presentable. I can still exercise and keep fit at other times of
              the week. So do not assume all are lazy when they do not want to
              walk.</p>
              <p>Before 2008, the working population is also entited to transfer
              rebate of 50 cents for each connecting trip. This is quite similar
              to distance-based calculation which is implemented. Last time it is
              60 cents -50 cents = 10 cents. Now is distance-based and could be
              anything from 0 to 30 cents depending on your earlier trip. So if
              you count by 5 days a week, it may be even out. This does not
              equate to laziness in people. </p>
              <p>Your third point is not sustainable. For every feeder
              introduced, there is a relevant reason to substantiate it. Please
              be specific on the short working trip which is introduced as a lazy
              alternative. </p>
              <p>Hey come on, with or without implementing these bus services,
              bus fares will increase. Everything else is also increasing. Bus
              drivers will also need yearly increment. Do you really seriously
              believe that by not introducing smrt 302A, bus fares will drop? I
              rest my case. Cheers. </p>

              <p>There is nothing wrong with being lazy, everyone is lazy at some point of time. The issue is the fares is too low and it promotes more people to be lazy, creating induced demand which is unsustainable.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you have not been paying adult fares in 2008 but the transfer rebate is only 25c before 2008, that is nearly 50c bus fare if you choose to transfer for 2-3 stops. Distance fare for transferring to 302A will only be 0c to 20c at most, but for most who transfer from MRT it does not exceed 10c, you can check the fare table.</p>
              <p>Considering a fair 3 trips per hour per bus, (20mins per round including uturn and rest), and 50 pax at 20c, the fare revenue is only $30 per hour. This is barely even enough to cover the fuel cost and wages of the bc, not to even mention the cost of having 1 additional bus placed on 302A which could be put to better use. The service is subsidised using 1.1billion bsep funds, so there is reasons to be accountable for this.</p>
              <p>I would not be surprised if the bus fares would hike as much as 20-30% in the next 2-3 years if they continue to promote such use of buses.</p>
