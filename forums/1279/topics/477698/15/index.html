              <p>858 definitely will be heavily impacted.. 969 wont. </p>
              <p>For those taking 34/27, it would be stupid to transfer at TPE stop. The time difference is not more than 05-10 minutes depending on time bet 27/34 and 969. People will waste more time in waiting for bus. and if rigid comes you might not even get to enter.</p>
              <p>So 969 I dont see big challenge... 858 def big issue... Will be stupid for people to continue on 27/34 to CGA when they can reach 20 mins earlier with 858. </p>
              <p>In future can have a Tampines service to CGA covering 27 route.. and have 27 terminate at Tampines Interchange instead. This will be needed given the high number of new HDBs coming along Tampines Ave 9/6 and central area.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, no to sbs 27 terminate at tampines interchange. Firstly, there is definitely no space to park due to the number of buses for sbs 27. Secondly, the direct link to changi airport is broken between hougang, buangkok, certain parts of sengkang and airport. There is no purpose to further inconvenience current passengers who are taking sbs 27 to ask them to transfer again. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, there are people from hougang/Buangkok and certain parts of sengkang who will still take sbs 27 to changi airport. They do not really want wait for another bus service if sbs 27 can still bring them to same destination. Give people a choice! Some want transfer, some do not want. Certainly not everybody will offload sbs 27 to wait for the smrt 858 because some do not want take the risk of standing on smrt 858 when they are already sitting down on sbs 27. </p>
              <p>There are also some people along tampines ave 9 who take sbs 27 direct to airport. Please don't forget about the people along tampines ave 9. </p>
              <p>And please oh please. If your suggestion does not work, please don't divert and call me stupid. Oh my goodness! How stupid can mr busanalyser get? Mr busanalyser still has the idea to suggest sbs 27 start at hougang and terminate at tampines! Furthermore, he suggests another new service from tampines to CGA! Hahaha. So on what basis? Has tampines interchange suddenly had the land and infrastructure to take in 2 more heavy demand services for sbs 27 and a new popular service to Changi airport? This sort of person still dares to say me stupid when he himself is no better! Cheers.</p>

              <p>I was not going to reply to your earlier note... but now that you still persist to argue... there are various ways to do it... if you THINK... 27 is a loop service right now... if Tampines interchange does not have space... sv 27 can still loop @ Tampines. </p>
              <p>CBP will be getting 4-5 service slots in 2015... don't you think some Tampines services like sv 20 will move there creating space at existing Tampines interchange?</p>
              <p>You are here not to find solutions but to tell 'this cannot be done and that cannot be done'.. typical LTA mentality.. no wonder everyone here thought u r from LTA (even if u r not) coz of your attitude problem. And yes, now I got personal.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, even others like Acx1688 has also feedbacked earlier that sbs 27 stopping at tampines is not going to happen. Not only me. Just reflect on it. The direct link between hougang/Buangkok and certain parts of sengkang to changi airport is certainly not going to be broken. </p>
              <p>Please move on! No time for all those nonsensical talk from you about what LTA, or personal attacks. I got no time for all these! Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, the impact is going to be very severe if the direct link from hougang/Buangkok mrt/certain parts of sengkang to changi airport is going to be broken. By asking most people to transfer to smrt 858 at the new TPE stop is not going to work fully.</p>
              <p>Smrt 858 is taking lots of crowd from woodlands/admiralty/sembawang/yishun (basically the northern part of Singapore) to changi airport already. By asking it to take all the people from northeast (hougang/Buangkok/sengkang albeit a transfer at TPE stop) to changi airport too is really too much of an overkill. That is why I have always insisted that sbs 27 route must remain and not trimmed down. You cannot expect the TPE stop to facilitate transfers from everybody who wants to go airport to take smrt 858 as what mr busanalyser has initially claimed in message at 7.39pm 5 October. Smrt 858 at its current frequency plus loading simply cannot cope if sbs 27 is trimmed. In terms of timing, sbs 27 is 2nd fastest in reaching changi airport after smrt 858. It basically plies tampines ave 9 and tampines ave 4 before embarking on expressway again to airport.  </p>
              <p>So from this part of island, smrt 858 plus sbs 27 plus sbs 34 are currently just enough to meet the demand. No shortening of these 3 routes until there is an alternative direct replacement. Please do not deprive people in hougang/Buangkok/sengkang their sbs 27 to airport or the outcry will be huge. You simply cannot cut off their service without providing them a direct alternative especially if there is heavy demand. Cheers.</p>

              <p>To be honest, 858 frequency damn suckish during peak hour, i would still stick to 27 all the way to CGA rather than being late for work while waiting for 1 858. Transfer also no point, i doubt the bus can tank the load. 858 always crowded at almost all times of the day off peak or peak from CGA or to CGA as it is filled with different kinds of commuters ranging from tourist or workers. </p>
              <p>27 freq very high, 858 is not, i ever waited 1h for this and 4 858 appeared wich shows so much on 858</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB 585L, yes correct. This is also same as the point I am bringing across to all of those in this forum. Smrt 858 is already bringing full load from the north to airport. Along the north area, it is taking in so many people and this may have derailed its frequency to a certain extent. So the northeast must have their own service sbs 27 which is also bringing quite heavy load to airport. Thus we really cannot expect everybody to disembark from sbs 27 at TPE stop to switch to smrt 858 or to cut short sbs 27 direct route to airport. At least you get the point. But others don't and simply brush me off in above messages. In terms of speed, smrt 858 &gt; sbs 27 &gt; sbs 34. In terms of freqency, sbs 27 &gt; smrt 858 and sbs 34. Anyway thanks. Cheers.</p>

              <p>If 858 use DDs or Bendies then it is feasible to transfer but 858 used full MAN thus will not be able to tank the load. I believe most of the time the bus is already full after Jalan Kayu</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB 585L, not possible. Changi airport got height restriction. So DDs are out. For such long distance, I think bendies will not be a good idea as it will slow down frequency even more. On the big picture, look at those bus services going to changi airport. Each and every service brings a different segment of residents living in major estates directly to the airport and back to the different towns. Proper planning has been done. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, sbs 27 only travels inside tampines along the deserted tampines ave 10, the little loading for 2 stops along tampines ave 9 and the few stops at mrt and century square and back on to expressway to changi airport. Granted sbs 27 may be 22-25 min from TPE stop to airport, 7 to 10 mins slower than 15 min for smrt 858 for TPE stop to airport, it is still not too bad a timing for sbs 27 considered the fact that its frequency is much much better. For comparison, sbs 34 takes 40+ min from TPE stop to airport. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Need to have 858M from Jalan Kayu or can have 27E from Hougang that goes express to CGA after TPE stop. This way loading on 858 will be compensated. 858 takes less than 10 mins to CGA from TPE while sv 27 takes around 25-30 minutes to CGA. So much time can be cut down. 34 takes around 30 minutes to CGA from TPE as well. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>All, I reached airport police station bus stop at 6.52pm. I reached changi airport PTB3 bus stop at 6.56pm. These are all actual timings. So total journey time from TPE stop to airport PTB3 is 17 min. More closer to my initial estimate of 15min. Cheers.</p></div>
