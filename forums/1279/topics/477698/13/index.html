              <p>There is nothing wrong with being lazy, everyone is lazy at some
              point of time. The issue is the fares is too low and it promotes
              more people to be lazy, creating induced demand which is
              unsustainable.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you have not been paying adult fares in 2008 but the
              transfer rebate is only 25c before 2008, that is nearly 50c bus
              fare if you choose to transfer for 2-3 stops. Distance fare for
              transferring to 302A will only be 0c to 20c at most, but for most
              who transfer from MRT it does not exceed 10c, you can check the
              fare table.</p>
              <p>Considering a fair 3 trips per hour per bus, (20mins per round
              including uturn and rest), and 50 pax at 20c, the fare revenue is
              only $30 per hour. This is barely even enough to cover the fuel
              cost and wages of the bc, not to even mention the cost of having 1
              additional bus placed on 302A which could be put to better use. The
              service is subsidised using 1.1billion bsep funds, so there is
              reasons to be accountable for this.</p>
              <p>I would not be surprised if the bus fares would hike as much as
              20-30% in the next 2-3 years if they continue to promote such use
              of buses.</p>

              <p>Hi mr bus stopping, why do you keep linking laziness to feeder bus services? Why do you keep linking low fares to laziness??? Do you know what is public transport for? Public transport is to link everybody to 400 metres of their destination. That is why there should be a bus stop within 400-500 metres. </p>
              <p>Going by your reasoning, we need to remove many feeder services in many parts of singapore. All human beings must start to walk to mrt or walk home. How could this be advocated where everybody walks irregardless of distance? A normal adult should be able to walk within 400 metres regularly, not more. Have you ever considered that not everybody who takes feeder buses/trunk services leading to mrt are lazy? Some have medical conditions. Some sleep late at night and some look after babies at night. They are tired.</p>
              <p>I pay adult fares la. In yr 2008 fare structure, 25 cents rebate is for transfer to feeder service. 50 cents rebate is transfer to trunk service. Trunk can act as feeder if it bypasses your house. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr bus stopping, I need to clarify. You hit the wrong point though. Everybody will have a bus stop WITHIN 400 metres from their house. Not minimum 400 metres. Some have it 10 metres, some 100 metres, some 200 metres. So the feeder bus or trunk bus service will bring them to that bus stop.</p>
              <p>Everywhere in Singapore, from 1 bus stop to 1 bus stop is 400-500 metres apart IN GENERAL. Not 800 metres. Take out your handphone and see any bus applications with distance and you will know that. 800 metres is 2 bus stop length. The purpose of feeder bus is to bring people directly to the nearest stop. So from that stop within a 400 metres range will be his destination which could be anything from 0 to 400 metres away. A normal adult walking distance is within 400 metres. </p>
              <p>So your belief on whoever hit the point is wrong. The bus service should bring people to their designated bus stop. If the person lives within 10 metres of bus stop, it is his problem. If he has to walk 200 metres from that stop, it is within walking distance and is his problem. </p>
              <p>However if you think everybody should walk 1km home from the MRT, so it is up to you. You are living in a fantasy world, then feel free to propose to LTA to cancel off all feeder services so that you think fares will drop. LTA will be laughing behind their back on receiving such nonsensical proposals expecting everybody to walk. </p>
              <p>And if you think those working professionals will change their habits not to take bus because it is to save less than 10 cents per transfer, so be it. Some cannot be even bothered. They just tap their card because they want to go home earlier as they have other tasks ahead or want to prepare for the rigours of work the next day. You think they really care if they deduct 3 cents or 15 cents? They have a transport budget monthly and don't really care. They only care that they must take bus in order to avoid taking the expensive cab.  Cheers!</p>

              service should bring people to their designated bus stop. If the
              person lives within 10 metres of bus stop, it is his problem. If he
              has to walk 200 metres from that stop, it is within walking
              distance and is his problem. </p>
              <p>However if you think everybody should walk 1km home from the
              MRT, so it is up to you. You are living in a fantasy world, then
              feel free to propose to LTA to cancel off all feeder services so
              that you think fares will drop.</p>
              <p>And if you think those working professionals will change their
              habits not to take bus because it is to save less than 10 cents per
              transfer, so be it. Cheers!</p>

              <p>He is referring to your sentence that he claimed you have gotten his point.

              <p>Seriously I have a hard time trying to understand what both of you are saying.

              <p>Hi mr Gus.Chong, when I say public transport is to link everybody to 400 metres of their destination, I mean the feeder/trunk bus will bring a resident to the nearest bus stop for their destination. Within 400 metres means 0 to 400 metres. If his office or home is just next to the bus stop, good for the guy. He just needs walk 20 metres or even less. If his office is at the one corner requiring 300 metres walk, then sorry for him. He needs walk 300 metres. In a normal case, a bus stop is normally 0 to 400 metres from a particular point. I do not mean walk 200 metres plus another 400 metres from the bus stop = 600 metres. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Gus, the intention of the original post was to highlight the unsustainability of short trips/routes such as 302A which is launching soon. It is not about distance to bus stops, etc.</p>
              <p>As a fellow fare paying adult, I am concerned because of the following:</p>
              <p>1. Distance based fares introduced in 2010 makes it very attractive for passengers to use bus services (not just feeders, but trunks) as a last mile connection to their door step.</p>
              <p>2. However, due to the current fare structure, the portion of fare revenue from the total distance fare distributed to such bus rides is little compared to the long train ride. This has been highlighted in the FRMC's report last year. (Page 66-67 of <a href="http://mot.gov.sg/news/FRMC%20Report%201%20Nov.pdf">link</a>)</p>
              <p>3. This creates a scenario which is unsustainable because the fare revenue from these very short distance fares is not enough to cover for the operations of such short trips/services. Also note that buses have to be added during peak hour, which could be put to better use on new links between towns.</p>
              <p>4. With more introductions of such services, there will be induced demand created (the more capacity added, the more people will use such services).</p>
              <p>5. This creates a vicious cycle, and eventually, it is the rest of the commuters that have to bear such costs with substantial fare hikes.</p>

              <p>Hi mr bus stopping, the transfer rebate is 50 cents, not 25 cents. It was implemented in early 2009 when they doubled the transfer rebates. I remembered very clearly about this.

              <p>That should be no reason why it should not stop, right. Anyway, late but good.</p>
              <p>I hope they make sv 64/139 call at Dhoby Ghaut MRT stop on Penang road. It is a lost opportunity for ppl from NSL/NEL/CCL who want to take this service.</p>
              <p>If you observe all buses from the stop turn into the extreme left lane. So easy to turn.</p>

              <p>Apart from distance of HDBs from MRT, i think 302A is a great move. I feel bad for residents in this estate. So poorly connected. Only two services 302 and 307 for entire estate. For 99% people here no direct service, have to either change at CCK Interchange or Yew Tee MRT. </p>
              <p>There should be at least one trunk service for residents here. Moreover some HDBs around st 54 etc. are so poorly connected. HDB estate near Sungei Kadut area on CCK side has no bus service either. </p>
              <p>So it is not just crescent. Most people who have their HDB inside have to walk 200-400m  inside the HDB complex. So this means nearly 1km walk from MRT. Please take that into perspective. If this was another SWT connecting within 800m, even I would have opposed. But here it is TOTALLY deserving and long pending.</p>

              <p>If that's your point, I agree. They should have a trunk service that starts from Bukit Panjang Interchange, does Keat Hong, bypasses CCK MRT stop and then does Yew Tee town (st 54, Crescent) giving additional connectivity to YT MRT. </p>
