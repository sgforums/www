              <p>74's loading on the opposite side is not high. If SBST wants to
                  continue with a few B10Ms, it should plan in a way that in
                  mornings, SDs ply during peak hours between BNV - HG and in the
                  evening from HG-BNV. During non-peak hours, I am indifferent.</p>
              <p>165s loading is very high between AMK - HG, otherwise not

              <p>I am typing what I observe - no need to get emotional about it my friend. It is all about perspective and our opinions can differ.</p>
              <p>I agree 74 has high loading but whenevr I have taken a fully packed DD (120 pax) and I see the DDs on the opposite side of the road. They are hardly with people. Hence I feel it is uni-directional load.</p>
              <p>132 - Let me point out the high loading part. Have you taken this bus ever to Hougang? I have. Huge crowd between Henderson to Redhill (80-90 pax), Redhill - Orchard (50 pax), beyond Orchard till AMK (30 pax), AMK (+90 pax). But then any bus at AMK station during peak hour is filled to the brim.</p>
              <p>153 - Load strictly uni-directional. Bus does not see more than 50 pax on 90% of its route. This has happened so many times when I have taken it to HG. and I count the pax (so I know what I am talking).</p>

              <p>though not a 74 regular (but more of a 151 154 one), I would find that putting the B10Ms on permenent split shift is better than putting it on regular shift, of which most of them are. problem is putting them on the right timeslot.. direction doesnt matter, its timing.</p>
              <p>132, for many years, only have seen higher loads are the 2 ends of the route. the whitley-orchard sector has only about 55-70 pax on average during peak.</p>
              <p>153 loads has dropped a lot since NEL opened, where those days when 153 had 4-6min frequency towards bt merah during AM Peak.. now its mostly catered to the school crowd. most of the time the bus gets packed due to the school children.</p>
              <p>as to why 90 needs DDs... imagine you are at macpherson rd going to toa payoh. the sv 8 DD comes.. packed... the next 8 DD comes.. packed.. the 90 scania comes.. also packed... what can you do? the 1825hrs and 1845hrs arrival at toa payoh are justified for its loads, as well as 0650 and 0710 trips from toa payoh in the morning.</p>

              <p><br>Land is not a problem if there is going to be a MRT station built there. LTA surely will demolish some of the buildings there to build the MRT station below Marine Parade Central.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parkway Parade will most likely stay, which I feel the shophouses and the wet market/hawker center to be demolished. Then the land above the MRT will become an integrated transport hub with bus interchange like the one in Ang Mo Kio. The bus interchange entrance and exit will be Marine Parade Central which leads to PP carpark.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But my favourite eating spot, Marine Parade wet market/hawker center should be relocated, to either the land beside Paramount shopping center or in Katong shopping center. At least can liven the place a bit, since now these 2 places are almost like ghost town... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I want to see a few DDs on 100. I  feel the route deserves to have DDs considering the peak hour load. In fact, some DDs can be moved from 111 to 100. </p>
              <p>There are only a few time slots when 132, 153 have a lot of load, hence I am not sure if so many DDs are justified. I feel 100, 135 need them more.</p>
              <p>More DDs required on 2, 7, 8, 133, 163 and some DDs can be moved from 30, 132, 143, 153. </p>
              <p>Also does 139 really require 2 DDs? </p>

              <p><br>Most routes in SG are that way. There is a need for route re-vamping. There are hardly any routes that will go fully occupied in one direction, and there are lesser than 10 that will go fully loaded on both directions and there is none during off-peak hours.</p>
