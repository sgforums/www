              <p>just rode on a bus from bus interchange to my house. Along the way, I observed the number of people alighting at each bus stop.</p>

              <p>Was on bus service 243W at around 1735hrs. Bus was SBS8768S.</p>
              <p>When bus left the bus interchange, there were about 40 people, still have ample space for more people, but apparently, that's all the people wanting to take 243W.</p>
              <ol>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1st bus stop: 3 people alight</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2nd bus stop: 6 people alight</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3rd bus stop: around 10 people alight</span></li>

              <p>by the 7th bus stop, the bus has (almost) "re-cycled" itself. 5th bus stop nobody alight very likely is because people there prefer to take 241/179 instead of 243W. the bulk of the initial loading alighted at St 61 (3rd) and Ave 5 (6th) bus stops.</p>
