              <p>I got a shock 1 morning when I saw this service using a double decker. I have never seen this before! Was this a 1 off? Or are they planning to make it into a dual operation - double decker and single?</p>
              <p>Btw I got an interesting story because this brought a sad memory.</p>
              <p>In 1994, I was  a policeman, those days service 196 used to ply Stadium Road, but only the single decker. The double decker would by pass and go only Nicoll Highway, because to enter Stadium road it had to go under the Merdeka Bridge.</p>
              <p>1 particular evening a double decker 196 actually went into Stadium Road, it then crashed into the height barrier that is situated before the bridge proper and the top part was ripped off. Six to 7 pax were injured as th top part was ripped off. I attended the case and helped later to clean up, there was a pic of me and my colleague assisting the bus company to sweep the road !</p>
              <p>The bus driver was charged in court, I think he was too used to driving single decker and forgot, but how the accident happened remains a mystery because before the height barrier I was sure there was another one where the pole would swing in case your height was over, so how could he miss that and drive on?</p>

              <p>To be exact, 54 covers part of withdrawn 104 and 134's route. Also note that there was no service 57 at that era, it was only service 56 then (the current 57 was introduced much later in the mid 20s).</p>

              <p>The overall loading on both 54 and 56 has dropped. 54 had 3 LO3x and 56 had 5 DDs at the beginning of the year, but mid-year, the DDs have moved to 55, 58 and now 54 has only 1 DD and 56 has just 3.</p>
              <p>In fact over the years, the loading on 57 has increased quite a bit but due to Depot road, no DDs can be used on it. </p>
              <p>56 DDs are also getting redundant coz the high loading is at Little India and Toa Payoh Central only. You can see a SD bus half seated on Middle Road opposite Intercontinental hotel during evening peak / morning peak. </p>

              <p>The overall loading on both 54 and 56 has dropped. 54 had 3 LO3x
              and 56 had 5 DDs at the beginning of the year, but mid-year, the
              DDs have moved to 55, 58 and now 54 has only 1 DD and 56 has just
              3.</p>
              <p>In fact over the years, the loading on 57 has increased quite a
              bit but due to Depot road, no DDs can be used on it. </p>
              <p>56 DDs are also getting redundant coz the high loading is at
              Little India and Toa Payoh Central only. You can see a SD bus half
              seated on Middle Road opposite Intercontinental hotel during
              evening peak / morning peak. </p>

              <p>the 3 DDs on 56 are timed for the peak hour loading for both peaks. the high loading during AM Peak is Novena MRT and Middle Rd. PM Peak is Middle Rd to Toa Payoh. The SD bus you spotted outside national library will get more pax at the next stop, leading to a few standees on the bus.</p>
              <p>56 DDs never gets a full load right up to the door. its one of the few services where the pax load lies on the borderline between SDs and DDs. There's only one occasion where a 56 DD is packed to the brim - that was on the night of 15 December 2011.</p>

              <p>What is even the use of having 1 DD on 54? Rather move it to 55, 58 or 59. </p>
              <p>56 I think max loading is between 60 - 80 pax. Never seen standing on a 56 DD. </p>

              <p>for that i believe you have to analyse the peak trip of the 54 DD.</p>

              <p>The norm is to </p>
              <p>1. Increase frequency of SD first</p>
