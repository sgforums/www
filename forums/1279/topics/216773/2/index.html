Well, I don't need a REAL adult to tell me what is right and what is wrong.<br>You not demanding, maybe yes, maybe not.<br>I am not used to people telling me what to and not to do, what to say and what not to say. I don't get my way every time either.<br>I am here to learn, not to confuse and flame people, I NEVER flamed anyone, didn't you notice?<br>I never demanded too much, just for some normal, sensical things. I underlined my understanding first, but never say that it cannot be accomplished.<br>Now I am just asking for some decent respect, why the hell I cannot get it, right? I never scold anyone, think about it this way. I abide by the f-ing rules, and I don't get anything in return.<br>Just a decent user, say something, and got insulted by some seemingly sensical kids, think about it this way, and you feel that I am in the worser situation.<br>My love for buses will not diminish however, 'cos I can operate with people whom I like, not with those who flame and insult.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I need to make some correction.<br><br>SL used to be last in the least for so many years until mid 2005 when the status changed. The position shot up fast and a lot of managment overhauls were made. Even though SL has the oldest buses.<br><br>Based on actual workshop report statistics in 2005, SL ranked No:1 while AMK ranked last. But overall after so many years, BN and HG are those that managed to maintain. Never last though never first. Not that I can still remeber of.<br><br>In 2006, our latest stats based on different breakdown stats, engineering quality, audits carried out by HQ, SL is still top ranking with the least safety features breech, least breakdown stats. Also on top of that, costs, labour were also taken into consideration. Since January to July 2006, SL has managed to score 70+% points as the leading workshop and AMK being the second maintains at 40+%. A very wide gap. The only time that AMK managed to close in was in Augut when SL failed to grasps the costs factor, but had the best breakdown rate for the whole year and slips to 45% while AMK at 42%. However even so, SL still manages to maintain No:1<br><br>As the fleet management GM &amp; the 5 MGRs also know. SL has the better workshop managements if we were to compare the 5. Has the highest pay/bus ratio. Has the best engineering projects advancement.<br><br>Comparing the work attitude of the various workshops, SL always have a higher quality as SL do not advocate the blind adherance of regulations but rather based on actual facts. This can be seen from the engineering projects carried out on same problems yet different solving methods. Of the 5 Tech offrs in SL, 3 were from the military and have better insights towards modern day management rather than the traditional old Singaporean Chinese management style. The other 2 though have been old, they still have a different type of charms. The workshop is very united from top to bottom based on meritocracy and not on race.<br><br>On the whole, I am not saying the other 4 workshops are not good. But based on all the actual stats, the other workshops are still catching up while SL is leading.<br><br>1 thing I learnt while in SBST is to view things through actual stats and not via personal experiences. In this way we can get the correct actual numbers to give the correct accessments. Especially when I have to write the employee accessments for year end employee dividends.</div>
