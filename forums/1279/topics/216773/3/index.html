For me, I dun feel that SLBP buses fit the things you say. SLBP buses are comfortable! Most of them go trunk service like 174 and 502. They are gd, no complain. Heat at the back ? No, I dun really feel it, only if u sit at the right hand side of the rear sides when the buses has travelling for 1.5 hrs. Proven when you take 174 and 502. Jerking? do u find SBS 413T had it? SBS 3755L? Except some buses like SBS 315T. Ehich I some kind dunno why they dun want to fix the probelm. Just like what I say, the ranking of the depot is important. This shows that the depot is capable in saving money and keep the bus going well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, Scania, my friend. Wah, talking is so nice, is it not? You, who are not afflicted in any way to SBST or any other bus operator, undermiming a stated fact brought forward by one of the managers in a bus depot. Friend, it has been highlighted time and again that bus maintenance is no walk in the park. And some things you mentioned are just the natural operation of the bus. Please, nobody here even give a pat in the back to the slbp staff for their effort to become #1, which they did, yet still someone come and say "Don't bluff, lah."</div>

But I still think BNDEP <strong> NAC MERCZ </strong> (In the past) with the Townlink livery are the best Mercz.... I wonder where they are now...

I think that even if the bodywork is of top and excellent quality, but the chassis rattles alot, the bus will still rattle. It is just like your computer chassis, your casing is the best, but your CPU fan and hardisk vibrates alot during usage, you will feel the casing vibrating, no matter how good ur casing is. The most important is that the chassis MUST NOT RATTLE, which is caused by the engine. Btw are the VO3x at SLDEP 1st.2nd or 3rd versions? I like the 3rd versions, they have nut-guards(which are very cool, cooler than the B9TLs') And do they have a 285hp or a 245hp engine, can anyone tell me?<br></div>
