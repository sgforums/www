                  <p>Indeed, by the same virtue, I'm not sure why PRC takes precedence. If an Burmese driver gets into an accident, it is because he is Burmese?</p>
                  <p>And to your observation that there are as many locals as foreigners applying for the job where you went for the interview, I quote:</p>
                  <p>"However, we could only attract 76 Singaporeans to join us as BCs in 2014 as compared to more than 1,000 Malaysians signed up as BCs last year."</p>

              <p>This quota is controlled by MOM.</p>
              <p>The numbers from their <a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/foreign-worker-levy/calculate-foreign-worker-quota">current online quota calculator</a> indicates PRC quota is at 8%. <a href="http://www.stjobs.sg/career-resources/hr-updates/spore-magnet-losing-its-foreign-worker-pull/a/63002">In 2012, the actual percentage stands at 13%</a></p>
              <p>If the figures in the calculator are correct, then the operator can no longer hire additional PRC drivers. Besides, there should be a lot more Hong Kong and Taiwanese drivers in Singapore (unless, they are all taken up by Malaysian drivers).</p>
              <p>The inability to hire Singaporean drivers brings massive grief to the operators, because it directly affects their foreign driver quota.</p>
              <p>However, if any operator tries to raise Singaporean drivers' pay to increase recruitment, pay disparity will increase and it will run into the same set of problems faced by SMRT a few years back.</p>

              <p>Yeah. And that's why I worry about the day when we cannot find Singaporean bus drivers.</p>
              <p>I wasn't advocating having more PRC drivers, but putting it in the title seems to suggest that being PRC is the reason you cause accidents, that's not objective. Can you imagine Singaporeans attacking PRCs in a riot just because of that reason? We ought to be more clear-headed than that.</p>
              <p>Thank you for the analysis though. I guess it was good fortune that we have had more Malaysian drivers, many of whom quit after the exchange rate then made them more reluctant to endure the hardship of commuting daily to work here.</p>

              <p>The public bus industry here is not sustainable. You know that when shares go up because because an operator has <em>lost</em> a parcel tender!</p>
              <p>A lot of money has gone into buying new buses, and these particular buses are not cheap to run. Good foreign drivers are difficult to retain with the current level of remuneration. New operators competing for drivers will lead to the inevitable - wages will increase to what should have been the true wage rate.</p>
              <p>Without heavy subsidy from the government, I suspect the minimum fare commuters have to pay in order to keep operators afloat in a couple of years time is at least S$3.00 cash, S$2.50 for card.</p>

              <p>One day Malaysians might balik kampung too. Even Malaysians find it tough. The industry was suffering from that a few years back. It will come back one day when the equation is right. It can come from elsewhere, it can come from Singapore too, but we are just lucky LTA is there to foot the bill this time round. You and I know the days when fares were too low and wages had to be depressed.</p>
