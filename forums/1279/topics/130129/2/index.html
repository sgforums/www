The stretch of the road was actually a 2-way road, and I remembered that there were permanent bus stops on both sides of the road. Eventually the stops on the other side of the road got pulled down. The bus stop design was similar to the ones now present. The road was converted to one-way quite some time back, presumably before 1994. Still can remember as I take svc 65 to Tampines Int to school last time, and always pass by that stretch.</div>
