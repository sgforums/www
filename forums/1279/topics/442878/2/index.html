              <p><br> LTA and SMRT should just ban and stop the use of bendy buses. They
                  jam and clog up every place they go, bus stops, bus interchanges,

              <p>Just imagine this incident is caused by a bendy bus that covers
                  the whole lanes across the road in Woodlands interchange, or a bus
                  reversing trying to get out of the berth because a bendy bus
                  blocked its way but instead hit another incoming bus behind,
                  imagine how long the queue be, espeically when there are many bendy
                  buses in the queues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Not just Woodlands, Yishun interchange also will experience long

                  berth, and the bus stops along Yishun Ave 2 just outside
                  Northpoint, just imagine how many people are late for work because

              <p>Bendies aren't deployed in the name of fun. They are deployed (full day or split) because the demand is there, Like sv856 which has majority of bendies are full day starts, 854 has 4 full day bendy starts, and 169 has 2 full day bendies for a start. I believe the starter don't place bendies (as full day starts or splits) for no reason. Anything that you aren't sastisfied with, Take it up to the dispatching office. Simple as that.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry, I am not even referring to the deployment. It is right to deploy higher capacity buses for timings for higher demands. But bendy buses are not suitable for our narrow and busy roads and bus stops, bus interchanges and bus depots which have limited space. One bus stop can comfortably stop 3 12 m buses instead of 2 bendy buses hogging even out of the bus bay.</p>
              <p>Double deckers will provide a better job of catering high demands yet take up lesser space on the roads and other bus facilities. Since SMRT is switching from Mercedes to MAN, might as well switch to double deckers by MAN as well.</p>
              <p>It smoothen their traffic operations in bus depots and interchanges and also help to cater high demands as well. The space they use to park bendies can park double the number of double deckers, which can easily solve the problem of overloaded buses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Let's face it. Bendies are a real pain seriously.</p>
              <p>As a driver, bendies are also buses I have to be particularly wary of because of the rear trailer. It doesn't mean bendies are inherently dangerous. I'm just pointing out that the flexible body mean the driver has to be wary of other things such as its length and the flexing body.</p>
              <p>And bendies really take up more space than could have been. DDs would be more welcomed. 2 DDs can be accomodated comfortably at one bus-stop. That is not true for 2 bendies. Parking lots are another problem.</p>
              <p>I mean. There has to be a good reason why 998Y and 999U remain as figments of history.</p>

              <p>I still remember when 811 was not yet able to accomodate bendies, i had to take the other direction just to get on during peak hours. So much students from other schools taking it. Good thing they relocated the berth and added in bendies.</p>

              <p><br>Chua Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok were under SBS previously, so there will be no problems for double deckers. Woodlands as mentioned, the roads are suitable for double deckers too.</p>
              <p>For Yishun, the current bus interchange will be torn down soon and replaced by one that is able to accomodate double deckers. Some of the roads there have lower trees but they can replaced by taller ones if LTA and National Parks are bothered to do so. Some small trees were replace before by taller trees, especially the stretch along Yishun Central outside KTPH.</p>
