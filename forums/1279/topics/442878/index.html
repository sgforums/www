              <p>Did anyone went to Woodlands Regional Interchange from 4.30pm onwards? There seems to be many buses unable to go into the interchange, thus resulting a jam. Several buses affected that time: TIB482A, SBS9429P (the one I'm in), TIB1190K, TIB868X, etc.</p>
              <p>I don't have a chance to understand what happened, can anyone who was also there fill in the details please?</p>

On Ground level, passengers were alighting on the traffic island where 161/168 turns left and go down the slope into the int. every passenger alighted there.<br><br>there were 4 168s together heading to Bedok. 7663 9404 9308 9632. suspect 9308 and 9632 alight passengers and str8away board passengers back to bedok. no break.<br><br>No pictures and no rego of O405 that got stuck. took just one bus to paralyse the entire interchange.</p></div>

              <p>WRI is just chaotic these days.</p>
              <p>They even created parking lots for bendies at the side of the road near the 161/168 berth which only served to create more woes and chaos.</p>
              <p>I watched one line of buses waiting patiently for an L plate bus attempt to slowly clear the parked bendies and buses queueing up to leave WRI at the left turn. *facepalm*</p>
              <p>Lagi unhelpful is the parking at alighting-bay.</p>

              <p><br>LTA and SMRT should just ban and stop the use of bendy buses. They jam and clog up every place they go, bus stops, bus interchanges, bus depots, busy roads, small roads, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Just imagine this incident is caused by a bendy bus that covers the whole lanes across the road in Woodlands interchange, or a bus reversing trying to get out of the berth because a bendy bus blocked its way but instead hit another incoming bus behind, imagine how long the queue be, espeically when there are many bendy buses in the queues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Not just Woodlands, Yishun interchange also will experience long queues of bendy buses if one of them got stuck in the alighting berth, and the bus stops along Yishun Ave 2 just outside Northpoint, just imagine how many people are late for work because of these long queues of bendy buses... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
