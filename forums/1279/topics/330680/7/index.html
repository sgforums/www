              <p>cmon lahh. BC drive and i sit can tell whether a bus moves off fast or slow lah. and you can feel the brakes and feel how the BC steps the pedal and its not only 1 BC.</p>
              <p>overall it was wise that AMDEP threw the crap over but i must say SLBP has made them worst. if i were to compare 98U's condition now and a month ago, i can tell you SLBP maintenance of its engines, brakes and suspension its much desired. Every depot does refurbishing of floors and repainting of stuff. but i see AMDEP doing them at a faster rate compared to SLBP. these are clearly factual.</p>

              <p><br>I'd just like to say something here... hope you can reflect upon it.</p>
              <p>SBS9888Y's godsister is a BC for SBS Transit, stationed at SLBP. She is a JERG standby and so she has driven about every other JERG service there is (even BNL ones before). She therefore has the highest exposure to different types of buses (be it B9TL, VO3x, LO3x, Merc, B10BLE CNG, MK4 PSV Soon Chow, MK4 DM3500 or K230). Her opinions are what he uses to gauge SLBP buses, why? His godsister is the one driving!</p>
              <p>I remember someone saying on the forum that SBS9888Y should not have said SLBP buses were crap because he does not work for SLBP. Let me say, that he gets most of this from his godsister. Yes I know he generalises, but by taking one bus from every model there is for his godsister to gauge, it makes up about almost every model of buses in SLBP. If he chooses to generalise, it is there for some reason, which of course, you should get him to clarify. His godsister drives about any other service every other day, she is exposed to so many different types of buses, are you trying to say that her opinions are all supposed to be disclaimed while yours are supposed to be highlighted in a good light just because she can say every other bad thing about SLBP buses?</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that ALL your opinions about SLBP buses are supposed to be disregarded too - I respect them since you're also living in the west. However, as much as AMDEP has good DM CACs and lousy DM OACs like what you always say, there are also good buses and bad buses for SLBP. Strangely, I've never heard you say anything about bad buses for SLBP. Meanwhile, SBS9888Y says (insert rego) here is bad, you spring into action immediately and condemn him all you can. Where's the reasoning? If something is bad, it is bad for a reason. None of us here would say (insert rego) here is bad because it is bad. ??? There is no logic behind this. Surely they got to be bad because of reasons like cleanliness, engine performace etc. And then, where does SBS9888Y get alot of this opinions from? His godsister! It is good that if you list out some buses which you dislike under SLBP; it gives us greater insight to SLBP buses. In fact, if you don't mention anything, it is assumable that ALL SLBP buses are good; in reality that isn't the true case. Isn't it?</p>
              <p>Have you ever seen me scream in anger when you say an AMDEP bus is bad? I respect your opinions because I take it you were a passenger on that bus, and having experienced the ride, your opinions are top-priority. But, why is that the opposite when I say that an SLBP bus is bad? Are ALL SLBP buses good? Some yes, some no. I may have taken one of the bad ones and I say it out now. Is there any crime then, if I say so? I would have been one of the passengers on board, and so my opinions are similarly, top priority? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me just highlight an example.</span> I took SBS 3805B on 66 before from JEI to Bukit Batok. My general opinions of this bus is that it has strong A/C (like many other DM CACs) but the only thing is it jerks too hard especially when changing gear. You can see everyone on the bus jolting a little everytime the bus jerks. </span><span style="color: #000000;">So, let me ask you, how would you respond to this? Similarly, I highlight the adverse of an example now. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I rode onboard SBS 9009T on 97 sometime ago from JEI to Harbourfront. It was fantasic. Nice acceleration and cooling A/C.</span> So, what are your comments too? Will you say that I'm stupid because I say 3805B is bad, and then praise me for saying 9009T is good?</span></p>
              <p>Different BCs say different things, yes, but all have a common point when they say so. They give the feedback about this particular bus because they are the ones behind the wheel. So please, everytime you hear him say (insert rego) here is lousy, think about why it is lousy. It has to come from somewhere - the BC himself/herself. You may say that SBS9888Y's godsister is only entertaining him with her opinions, but then again, is she so free to say Bus A is good when its bad, and Bus B bad when its good? They speak through their feelings and not what they think can entertain the person who asks them. It makes no sense to lie to another passenger about the bus because if the bus is bad, not only is the passenger's comfortness compromised, but also the BC. And you can imagine how the BC is going to feel after driving the same lousy bus for 9, 10 hours.</p>

              <p>So you spoke to close to every BC in SLBP? Or your godsister spoke to close to every BC? I am not trying to embarass you, but if it is the latter, it just makes the information more unreliable. Can you imagine how many people the information gone through before it reachs you? E.g. BC A talks to BC B, and then BC B goes on to talk to your godsister, saying that BC A said something. So now your godsister has information about BC A's sentiments on some buses through BC B, then she goes on to tell you, and then you tell us. Just like this, the information has gone through 3 people.</p>
              <p>Also, there is a time lag. For example, you might say that SBSXXXX is good when you took it say 10days ago. And then another person disputes to say it is lousy some 10 days later. In this case both of you are probably correct. Simply because things can change in 10 days. And before we know it, the bickering has begun.</p>
              <p>Lastly, do you realise that if you tend to take more buses from SL, you could end up thinking that SL buses are worse or better simply because the majority of your rides are on SL buses.</p>
              <p>What I want to say is this, there are too many variables involved and unless you can publish a very detailed report, (even then there are limitations), we all are unable to come to a conclusive stand on which depot has better buses.</p>

              <p>Your post was super long, so I shortened for you with the dots. Anyway, has it occured to you that his godsister could have some personal bias?

              <p>I didn't read you full post as it was awefully long, but what I want to say is this. Can you all please please stop this whole childish arguement on which depot has better buses? Each and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. All these arguements stem from people making sweeping statements about bus quality, which at the very best are mildly true. These arguements, if avoided would make this much more pleasant forum.</p>

              <p>Let's put it this way. She can be biased, but her information is still first-hand information because it comes from an SLBP BC who drives SLBP bus. Say, if she is an HGDEP BC and she is talking about SLBP buses, then I can't say anything. Because the degree of reliability here is low.</p>
              <p>And let's put the whole matter off. I'm just speaking as a 3rd person's point of view. You should get SBS9888Y to clarify certain things as he knows more about the West district than I do.</p>

WRI is not suited for OC500LEs due the berths. (not the entrance/exit; if K230s can visit CGI almost every 10 minutes, so can OC500LEs do for WRI)</p>
              <p>Unless something is done to the structure @ WRI, WLDEP won't get OC500LEs for now. Meanwhile, AMDEP and KJDEP will be taking these new buses, and to clear space, they donate buses to WLDEP.</p>

              <p>I never said 9888Y was unreliable. I never suggested that SL buses are poorly maintained, neither did I mention that SL buses are well maintained.</p>
              <p>Let's be clear here.</p>
              <p>Fact: The information is 2nd hand.</p>
              <p>My inference and the basis of my arguement: 2nd hand information is not reliable.</p>
              <p>Your opinion: I am harping on it. </p>
              <p>Why did I bring this up? I had a problem with the idea that since his godsister is a BC, his information is therefore reliable. I have nothing against anyone here, but I just want to put to light the fact that his information can possibly be unreliable too. Whether to believe the information, I leave it to you, and your own judgement.</p>
