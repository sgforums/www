              <p>Why should I go find out? All I want to do is to point out that there is a chance that his information is not the most reliable.</p>
              <p>I have never mentioned or suggested that 9888Y is telling a lie, if you want to suggest I am doing it, back it up. It's just that everyone should take information with a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>I never said 9888Y was unreliable. I never suggested that SL buses are poorly maintained, neither did I mention that SL buses are well maintained.</p>
              <p>Let's be clear here.</p>
              <p>Fact: The information is 2nd hand.</p>
              <p>My inference and the basis of my arguement: 2nd hand information is not reliable.</p>
              <p>Your opinion: I am harping on it. </p>
              <p>Why did I bring this up? I had a problem with the idea that since his godsister is a BC, his information is therefore reliable. I have nothing against anyone here, but I just want to put to light the fact that his information can possibly be unreliable too. Whether to believe the information, I leave it to you, and your own judgement.</p>

              <p><br>I'd just like to say something here... hope you can reflect upon it.</p>
              <p>SBS9888Y's godsister is a BC for SBS Transit, stationed at SLBP. She is a JERG standby and so she has driven about every other JERG service there is (even BNL ones before). She therefore has the highest exposure to different types of buses (be it B9TL, VO3x, LO3x, Merc, B10BLE CNG, MK4 PSV Soon Chow, MK4 DM3500 or K230). Her opinions are what he uses to gauge SLBP buses, why? His godsister is the one driving!</p>
              <p>I remember someone saying on the forum that SBS9888Y should not have said SLBP buses were crap because he does not work for SLBP. Let me say, that he gets most of this from his godsister. Yes I know he generalises, but by taking one bus from every model there is for his godsister to gauge, it makes up about almost every model of buses in SLBP. If he chooses to generalise, it is there for some reason, which of course, you should get him to clarify. His godsister drives about any other service every other day, she is exposed to so many different types of buses, are you trying to say that her opinions are all supposed to be disclaimed while yours are supposed to be highlighted in a good light just because she can say every other bad thing about SLBP buses?</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that ALL your opinions about SLBP buses are supposed to be disregarded too - I respect them since you're also living in the west. However, as much as AMDEP has good DM CACs and lousy DM OACs like what you always say, there are also good buses and bad buses for SLBP. Strangely, I've never heard you say anything about bad buses for SLBP. Meanwhile, SBS9888Y says (insert rego) here is bad, you spring into action immediately and condemn him all you can. Where's the reasoning? If something is bad, it is bad for a reason. None of us here would say (insert rego) here is bad because it is bad. ??? There is no logic behind this. Surely they got to be bad because of reasons like cleanliness, engine performace etc. And then, where does SBS9888Y get alot of this opinions from? His godsister! It is good that if you list out some buses which you dislike under SLBP; it gives us greater insight to SLBP buses. In fact, if you don't mention anything, it is assumable that ALL SLBP buses are good; in reality that isn't the true case. Isn't it?</p>
              <p>Have you ever seen me scream in anger when you say an AMDEP bus is bad? I respect your opinions because I take it you were a passenger on that bus, and having experienced the ride, your opinions are top-priority. But, why is that the opposite when I say that an SLBP bus is bad? Are ALL SLBP buses good? Some yes, some no. I may have taken one of the bad ones and I say it out now. Is there any crime then, if I say so? I would have been one of the passengers on board, and so my opinions are similarly, top priority? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let me just highlight an example.</span> I took SBS 3805B on 66 before from JEI to Bukit Batok. My general opinions of this bus is that it has strong A/C (like many other DM CACs) but the only thing is it jerks too hard especially when changing gear. You can see everyone on the bus jolting a little everytime the bus jerks.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">So, let me ask you, how would you respond to this? Similarly, I highlight the adverse of an example now. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I rode onboard SBS 9009T on 97 sometime ago from JEI to Harbourfront. It was fantasic. Nice acceleration and cooling A/C.</span> So, what are your comments too? Will you say that I'm stupid because I say 3805B is bad, and then praise me for saying 9009T is good?</span></p>
              <p>Different BCs say different things, yes, but all have a common point when they say so. They give the feedback about this particular bus because they are the ones behind the wheel. So please, everytime you hear him say (insert rego) here is lousy, think about why it is lousy. It has to come from somewhere - the BC himself/herself. You may say that SBS9888Y's godsister is only entertaining him with her opinions, but then again, is she so free to say Bus A is good when its bad, and Bus B bad when its good? They speak through their feelings and not what they think can entertain the person who asks them. It makes no sense to lie to another passenger about the bus because if the bus is bad, not only is the passenger's comfortness compromised, but also the BC. And you can imagine how the BC is going to feel after driving the same lousy bus for 9, 10 hours.</p>

              <p><br>Relax.. I understand your explanation. What I feel that you dunno me enough. I had mentioned many times that there are problematic  SLBP buses. I dunno whether u know? U guys are only focused and amazed when i talk about AMDEP buses. I dun care that guy got wat godsister or wat. Most BC judge buses and drive buses differently. Especially such standby BC which drive diff model of buses may nt understand these good enough like hw to drive them. Just like driving a mercz and K230UB is diff. Maybe I talk to diff BC? They are mostly who drive Express 502 buses. There would also be problematic buses. To be frank, most SLBP BC say that the mech from SLWS are putting less effort on the mercz and more on Vo2x and LO3x and any other older. As most mercz are scrapping by next year.</p>
