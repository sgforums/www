That is only what you believe. It is your OWN opinion.. It's not a fact in anyway.. I believe your history teacher had taught you before that there is a very great difference between a FACT and an OPINION. Do hope that you would stop surfing the net.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">Perhaps a little history might help. We all know of Leyland's most successful DD model, the Olympian. Such was its popularity, it was the only Leyland bus model which was allowed to continue production after the Volvo takeover. In 1993, Volvo decided to drop the Leyland name altogether and improve upon the Olympian chassis by using Volvo parts and engines, which resulted in the Volvo Olympian. Later, with the introduction of stepless DDs from rival companies, Volvo decided to introduce their own stepless DD too. The Olympian chassis was modified by moving the radiator position from the front to the farside, behind the front axle, so that a stepless entrance is possible. The new chassis' model number is B10TL and its model name is Super Olympian.<br><br>The B9TL was a further improvement on the B10TL. For some reasons, the side radiator position didn't go down too well. So, it was decided to relocate the radiator to the rear. An improved engine was developed which is smaller but produces more power. Hence, a new chassis, the B9TL was born. Oddly, the name Olympian was given to the new chassis. Why? I don't know.</div></blockquote>i will add to this for my opinion that the silly exhuast braking (uhhh i mean the extra engine reving when the B9TL want to stopping)  engaged in the B9TL engine is rather...jerky and irritating.. prefer b10TL engine model.<br><br>still if we have merc OC500LEs the "exhuast braking" (bad use of technical terms i admit)  also will drive one to jerks and irritations..<br><br>dunno if its the Zf new generation gearbox that cause the silly excess noise n engine revs.<br><br>--------------<br>oh for gods sake:<br><br>the B10TL is the technical name. the volvo super olympian is another name. and yes the "super" comes from our SBS superbus. UK seems to take singapore seriusoly enough to add the Super word. just like they have the PS alexander bodywork based on the P bodywork. the extra  S signifies Singapore...hhhhaaaaa...uhhh the PS bodywork is used on Mark 2s in Uk n singapore.<br><br>as for the B9TL one<br>the B9TL is another olympin product. so can call it a volvo olympain.<br><br>but plese dun cause confusion when u say the SBS92xx 93xx 94xx 95xx 96xx volvo olympains are B9TLs. no doubt olympins but not using the B9TL engine and dash config and chasis ...ah fine the B9TL kit.<br><br>i will like to clear up on the dash configuration on the B9TL.<br><br>this dash configuration is the new standard volvo dash configuration. i like the digital clock added and the error message display thing...<br><br>this dash is ALSO used on some B10TLs... those newer ones in Hong Kong.<br><br>please dun confuse urself when u go Hong Kong and find a similiar dash on a B10TL instead of the usual B9TL in singapore.<br><br>lols<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

So that's why I'm not so sure whether they put the word "Super" just for the sake of SG.<br><br>UK doesn't have any VSOs in service I believe. The only countries which have VSOs are SG &amp; HK.</div>
