            <div class='col-md body'>i was at JB recently and i wan to noe if anyone keeps a list of routes of buses in Johor.. from wat i noe, there are no bus guides selling in JB and at major bus stops at city centre there are staffs that will attend to your queries.. so far i've managed to noe the destinations of some buses (majority going to Skudai and Taman Universiti area) but i haven't tried them yet.. from wat i got from the locals, bus fares start from RM0.80 and go up in stages to a maximum of RM2.40.. of cos u pay by cash with no change given..<br><br>and from wat i knew from the locals, "maju" buses are run by the Malays and ply mostly northern and eastern JB like Pasir Gudang and Masai and "Transit Link" buses are run by the Chinese and ply mostly western JB like Skudai..<br><br>CAUSEWAY LINK (yellow)<br>CW-1: Larkin - JB - Kranji MRT<br>CW-2: Larkin - JB - Kempas<br><br>TRANSIT LINK (white-red)<br>15: JB - Tun Aminah - Selesajaya<br>39: Larkin - JB - Masai<br>96: Larkin - Pontian<br>207: Larkin - Senai Airport<br>208: JB - Masai<br>226: JB - Tun Aminah<br>226A: JB - Taman Universiti<br>301: JB - Taman Perling - Jln Layang<br>322: JB - Taman Damai Jaya - Skudai Baru<br>323: JB - Taman Sri Skudai<br>328: JB - Tun Aminah - Skudai Baru<br>331: JB - Skudai Parade (?) - Taman Universiti<br>348: JB - Skudai - Kangkar Pulai<br><br>and i realised though the body of most Transit Link buses are the same, some actually used the same engine as those used by Tibs' O405s (Mercedes OM 447 HLA).. but those are really in the minority, about 1 in 10 buses.. if you are in JB next time try to hear the engine when u see a Transit Link bus starting off..<br><br>another interesting info was how SBST Svc 170 was made re-route and use the Kota Raya Bus Terminal for its blue route to City Square.. i heard that JB intra-state buses used to ply from Kota Raya Terminal back to the residential areas in Johor but they abandoned it as there were a lot of pickpockets and robberies in the terminal so it became like an abandoned bus terminal and they made SBST 170 to terminate there instead.. and it seems like either CW-1 or CW-2 stops there too.. the new hawker centre annex next to the terminal complex was shifted from a nearby torn-down hawker centre near City Square adjacent to the Public Bank along Jln Wong Ah Fook.. construction is going on in that torn-down area now..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">TRANSIT LINK (white-red)<br>15: JB - Tun Aminah - Selesajaya<br>39: Larkin - JB - Masai<br>96: Larkin - Pontian<br>207: Larkin - Senai Airport<br>208: JB - Masai<br>226: JB - Tun Aminah<br>226A: JB - Taman Universiti<br>301: JB - Taman Perling - Jln Layang<br>322: JB - Taman Damai Jaya - Skudai Baru<br>323: JB - Taman Sri Skudai<br>328: JB - Tun Aminah - Skudai Baru<br>331: JB - Skudai Parade (?) - Taman Universiti<br>348: JB - Skudai - Kangkar Pulai<br></div></blockquote>A few mistakes above. 96, 207, 208, 226 &amp; 226A are operated by Maju, not TransitLink. 96 is an express service.<br><br>Causeway Link mainly has 2 types of MAN buses, the 18.310 and 18.250. The former is a coach, has manual transmission and Liannex bodywork. The latter is a citybus with auto transmission. There are 2 types of bodies for the 250, Liannex and Hicom. There is an interesting pattern for Causeway Link's service numbers. Here are some routes operated by Causeway Link within the state of Johor. Causeway Link buses are all One-Man-Operated (OMO) and full A/C.<br><br>66 - Kota Tinggi<br>99 - Masai<br>777 - Kulai<br>888 - Ayer Hitam<br><br>On a previous trip to JB, I spotted a new type of service operated by Causeway Link. It's like a shuttle service between the city area and the outskirts. 9.5m Mercedes buses are used on this service.<br><br>TransitLink is actually an amalgamation of several bus companies which include South Johore, T.Hakkim, ALEC, Zoomlink and Pantai Indah. Their buses have locally built bodies of the same design which makes it hard to identify the model from afar. But there are also Duple Metsec bodied Dennis Lances. TransitLink have several models in their works:- Scania N113, Dennis Lance, Hino AK / RK, Mercedes-Benz O405 and 1318. The 1318 is the dominant model and there are 2 variants, front-engined (OF) and rear-engined (OH). Its hard to tell them apart. Both look the same except for 6 small horizontal slots located under the front windscreen of the OF buses.<br>Here are a couple TransitLink services. Some are OMO, some have conductors while a few have both (hybrid). There are full A/C, partial A/C and non-A/C services:<br>2 - Ayer Hitam<br>3 - Pontian<br>16 - No idea<br>41 - Kota Tinggi (TMO)<br>140 - Pasir Gudang (OMO)<br>180 - Don't know where it goes exactly but pass by Holiday Plaza.<br>210 - No idea<br>331 - Taman Universiti / Skudai Parade / Angsana<br><br>Maju is partially owned by the Johor State. All of their buses have Volgren bodywork except for some Darts, which have DM bodywork, and some old Hino AKs with local bodywork. Maju has MAN SL252, MAN midibus of unknown model, Dennis Dart, Scania N113, Hino AK and RK (dominant model).<br>Here are some Maju services, all of which have conductors and change given. For buses with no conductors, passengers pay to the driver who will issue tickets by hand. All are full A/C.:<br>8 - Loop service from Larkin to JB Town Centre.<br>10 - Permas Jaya<br>11 - Kompleks Bebas Cukai Stulang Laut (Stulang Laut Duty Free Complex)<br><br>At Larkin Bus Station, you will also see other operators such as S&amp;S, Pasir Gudang Bus Supply (PGBS), etc. These operators are based outside Johor Bahru.</div>
