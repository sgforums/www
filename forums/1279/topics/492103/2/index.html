              <p>Thats true but generally I feel SBST has been spamming its
              resources on winding trunks instead... And it definitely isnt true
              23 is exaggerated... Go to Boon Keng in the evening on ANY DAY and
              you will think twice about saying that</p>

              <p>Actually SBST has slowed down upgrading/adding buses on services. Hardly any in the last quarter. Most services in my opinion are quite okay. The ones where I personally feel some upgrades (not fleet add) is required are:</p>
              <p>5</p>
              <p>30</p>
              <p>43</p>
              <p>103</p>
              <p>109</p>
              <p>111 </p>

              <p>For me, the services I think needs fleet upgrades are:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7 - Full DD on weekend nights, see svc 111 notes (towards Clementi instead of Queenstown), for weekdays 7 is doing fine, IMO 7 is the fastest connection between Clementi and Orchard (with 106 as an alternative)</p>
              <p>30 - 2-3 SD (1 bus crossover to 536) with the rest of the fleet DD</p>
              <p>99 - to full DD, can even reduce buses once the KUBs and citaro is out (I noticed that 5132X tends to bunch with a DD during off-peak and 5132X takes the load as it is ahead of the DD)</p>
              <p>111 - SDs can be packed to the door on weekend nights by the time it reaches Trader Hotel/Tanglin Mall towards Queenstown, sure could use more DDs, DDs can get over 60 pax during nighttime</p>
              <p>181 - I agree that 181 could use a fleet upgrade given the high peak hour loading</p>
              <p>240 - overly spammed with SD, can cut 1-2 buses after upgrade</p>

              <p>99 upgrade seriously can clear space in BBDEP. That's assuming they throw away the SDs displaced.</p>
              <p>No use upgrading for ARBP 5, unless they throw the SDs as well. But fleet cut fo 5 is definitely a no-no, judging by the frequency. </p>
