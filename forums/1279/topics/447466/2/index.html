              <p>It is generally accepted that articulated buses are more suitable for shorter services with a constant flow of passengers boarding and alighting.  This is because articulated buses promote faster dwell times at stops due to the ease of access.</p>
              <p>As stated by others above, articulated buses have several major advantages: they are the same height as a single-deck rigid bus meaning that they can travel (almost) anywhere that a normal single-deck rigid bus can and they are generally safer for passengers.</p>
              <p>Articulated buses also tend to share a high proportion of parts with the corresponding single-deck rigid bus, so the extra servicing complexity is minimal.</p>
              <p>Double deckers are suitable for longer limited stop and express services where the frequency of stops (and therefore movement of passengers on and off the bus) is less.  A crowded double decker bus is likely to take much longer to unload than a crowded articulated bus, and passengers need to negotiate a staircase in order to disembark from the upper deck.  Additionally, double decker buses are much taller and much consideration needs to be taken for the route that they are used on.  Double decker buses place more weight per axle onto the road and are therefore more damaging to the road network, but on the other hand, they take up less depot space and road space.</p>

              <p><br>But there are many complains from other road users that the tips of the back trailers almost hit them, especially when the road is wet. But mounting kerbs seems pretty common.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>It is generally accepted that articulated buses are more suitable for shorter services with a constant flow of passengers boarding and alighting.  This is because articulated buses promote faster dwell times at stops due to the ease of access.</p>
              <p>As stated by others above, articulated buses have several major advantages: they are the same height as a single-deck rigid bus meaning that they can travel (almost) anywhere that a normal single-deck rigid bus can and they are generally safer for passengers.</p>
              <p>Articulated buses also tend to share a high proportion of parts with the corresponding single-deck rigid bus, so the extra servicing complexity is minimal.</p>
              <p>Double deckers are suitable for longer limited stop and express services where the frequency of stops (and therefore movement of passengers on and off the bus) is less.  A crowded double decker bus is likely to take much longer to unload than a crowded articulated bus, and passengers need to negotiate a staircase in order to disembark from the upper deck.  Additionally, double decker buses are much taller and much consideration needs to be taken for the route that they are used on.  Double decker buses place more weight per axle onto the road and are therefore more damaging to the road network, but on the other hand, they take up less depot space and road space.</p>

              <p><br>Actually bendy buses are the most harzardous model among the 3 types of buses used in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Bendy buses have the highest accident rates here, followed by single deckers with double deckers (10.6m and 12m versions) the safest on the roads. This is according to someone who have friends working in LTA.</p>
              <p>Bendy buses have longer length and thus higher risks of meeting an accident with other vehicles. Moreover, bendy buses joints are controlled by an electronic turntable. No matter what, electronics will not always be failproof and is worse if not maintained properly. There will be instances that it might malfunction and cause slight sways for the trailer. Worn out tires, wet roads, plus inbalanced loads at either trailers would cause potential hazards of swaying trailers. However all these can be prevented with costly maintanance but this will just increase operating costs for such kind of buses as compared to a double or single decker.</p>
              <p>And more, bendy buses accounts the highest number of burnt bus incidents started by themselves in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Thus bendy buses are more dangerous as it seems in theory.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One incident today had further made me believed that bendy buses are not suitable here, especially in big numbers.</p>
              <p>A bendy broke down this morning at 811/854 berth Yishun interchange. The whole bus almost blocked the passage way, leaving a small gap which other buses still can go through slowly. Other buses behind got a bit delayed with the slow traffic. One replacement bus, a Dennis Lance have to move in front of the broken down bendy to carry those stranded passengers. And just bad timing, a 854 bendy had to fetch its passengers as well and so have to park behind the broken down bendy but BC realised he parked too near behind so had to reverse a bit, then BC honked at the queue to board. The first few passengers can't see the bus number at first as it was too far off the berth and thought cannot board. Then these passengers also have to walk a long way bypass the broken down bendy to board the 854 bus.</p>
              <p>The length of the 854 bendy again blocked the 171/812 berth, which cause another 812 bus had to delay in stopping at the berth. One single decker along the slow traffic honked at the slow traffic, presuming that the BC had already been late. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Just look at the choas caused by a broken down empty 17.5m bus, and it slows down other buses and passengers and the operations of the bus intercahnge. If the bus is a 12m, would it be so chaotic??? And Yishun interchange is bigger than some of the newer ones. The future Yishun interchange might be smaller and if this happens, it will be much worse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes, I think I know why Singapore's interchanges don't work with bendies. There's too much turning, because of the layouts. Bendies work best in relatively straight platforms. What with herringbone end-on berths as well as sawtooth berths, and 90-degree turns, a standard Singaporean interchange is hell for a bendy.</p></div>

              <p>I'd prefer only a mix of 12m SDs and ADDs for both bus operators.</p>
              <p>Look at the shrinking new bus interchanges; the authorties are trying to minimise land use. So if SMRT-controlled bus interchanges are going to be replaced with new bus hubs, how are they going to accomodate the bendies?</p>
