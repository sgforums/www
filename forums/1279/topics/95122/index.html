YES.. i do have a little bit of study on HongKong Bus.. the bus that you was talking about was a Dennis Dragon.. Well.. these buses was introduced in the 80s.. to cope with the growing population of HongKong.. there were 2 different types of these Buses available..<br><br>- Dennis Dragon (Duple Metsec)<br>- Leyland Olympian (Alexander 'R' type Body)<br><br>These buses was special in a way that the seating plan for the upper deck was 3+2.. instead of the usual 2+2 that we have it now.. At that time, due to the needs of the different companies, there were different passenger capacities which vary between 149 and 164.. This is because that different companies have different seating plan on the lower deck as some company had more standing area than seating area..(upp deck is usual 3+2 seating plan).. Well.. i do hope that this will answer your question.. Ya.. Dennis Dominator DO NOT HAVE THE 3 DOORS version.. Only dragon.. Sadly.. if you go to HongKong now, you wont find all these buses running on the road anymore.. KMB have been takin these buses away from service since 2002.. (Well.. the aim of KMB was to Transform into a fully AirCon Fleet like CityBus..Also another bus company in HK..)</div>

LongWin is under KMB.. and theres another Airport Express CityFlyer, is Under CityBus.. and in return, CiTyBus was sold by Stagecoach to New World First Bus.. that means.... there are only 2 main Bus Provider in the City Area.. although CityBus still exists.. the company is under NWFB..</div>

LWB's Volvo are transfered to KMB's role of Golden Buses in exchange for Tridents. Cutybus and NWFB belongs to NW Holdings that operates the franchise of CSX Port Terminal in HK which is going to be sold to either HPH, PSA or CMH through a tender</div>
