              <p>dun mention abt pirate buses, they aren't even licensed to operate. If there's langa, let's see how going to cover insurance or ICA/ LTA come and enforcement. Tat's take it at your own risk</p>
              <p>Cross border I've said said at heading post there's no way imo it can be expanded. Anyway there are really ppl who take 170 from JB to Bt Timah, nothing surprising.</p>
              <p>I've alrdy posted 950 holiday1 could be at 8-9 mins, so dun come and shoot out wat suggestion on gmail of 3 mins or watever. if SMRT dun have enough buses, then why 531 can be 4-8 mins? profits first right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>if you find it rubbish go ahead</p>
              <p>But take it if its to nation interest to promote public tpt for the future w/ a bigger population. It isn't just abt 'SMRT being a GLC tat kind of sv std' or wat, the whole planning of tpt system is not even working anymore, if no one go overhauls it, I can tell you 1 - 3 yrs later the whole system is going to crash</p>
              <p>imagine yourself tring to board a bus, and the driver bo chap just close and open e door when your legs are on the bus floorboard. how you going to feel? I think cos you're not going to care as long as not I kena right?</p>

              <p>I think the best is that SMRT or SBS Transit introduce another service frm Sin to Larkin becuase Larkin is quite popular for travelling to other states in Malaysia and most singaporean visits there. For the moment, 170 only plys frm Queen Street to Larkin.</p>
              <p>My point of view, introducing new svc such as 160 &amp; 950 frm Jurong East &amp; Woodlands plys to Kotaraya Bus ter is good, but passangers rather walk 2 City Square area frm the new CIQ rather. I notice that 160,170(Blue) &amp; 950 bring nobody frm JB Custom to Kotaraya. The most you can see is 1-3 passengers.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that have another svc to Larkin. Right now, there's
              more service to Kotaraya rather than Larkin. 160 &amp; 950 do most in
              bringing passengers frm Woodlands Ckpt to JB Ckpt. Try to imagine,
              160,170(Blue) &amp; 950 comes at all times while 170(Red) come only 1
              bus. As a result, long queue creates at the JB Custom and maybe some
              passengers have 2 wait another bus. Likewise CW-1 sometimes enter kotaraya 2 ter due to high demad to Larkin.</p>
              <p>Kotaraya 2 Ter: 160, 170(Blue), 950 &amp; CW-1</p>
              <p>Larkin Ter: 170 (Red), CW-1, CW-2 , CW Link Shuttle frm JB CIQ to Larkin to &amp; fro &amp; S'pore Johore Exp.</p>

              <p><br>First thing...</p>
              <p>You compare for the better, not the worse.</p>
              <p>Yes, I agree that public transport here is still on the whole, ok, but if I cannot board the bus because it is full and the frequency is so crap that the next bus that comes is also full, then what makes it different from buses that do not even appear??</p>
              <p>Why is SMRT still passing up the chance to purchase DDs? I don't get the sex appeal of bendies....S'pore is only so big and every space counts and bendies take up a fair bit of space.</p>
              <p>Don't need to talk about just buses...there are times when I try to take the train in the late morning and it is packed. Why? Because the train frequency was 8 min. They don't show 8 min by the way, they simply wait 2 - 3 min and then post 6 min on the screen.</p>
              <p>If you guys can only think of profits and profits and profits and the squeezing of passengers, then thats very sad for you. You should be wanting people to see pull factors in taking public transport, and not push factors to force them to take them through higher costs and then wonder why everyone is still willing to fork out $$ for ERP and cars.</p>
              <p>Oh by the way, when is the govt gonna realise that economics will not solve all the problems with regards to jams? Don't they see that people are ultimately still people who wish to eat with their families?? Why are they encouraging people to jam up alternative roads and going home later and in the same breath coming up with days like family day and telling people to build family bonds?? Can't they see the problem really lies with people's reluctance to take public transport for very good reasons??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You're not even thinking when you post "stop wasting bandwidth"! At the very least you should be applying some critical thinking when you see complaints about the public transport. Complaints might appear easily, nonetheless they don't appear for no reasons.</p>

              pea-sized-small and cannot see anything beyond today.</p>
              <p>Yes! I know 950 has bad service standards - I experienced
              similar things on 857 last night. But you can whine here all day
              till the cows, lambs and dogs come home and nobody will give a shit
              about your rubbish. Why not you try managing the routes, fleets and
              service standards and see how easy it is? With this
              all-talk-no-action attitude, of course cannot lah. I figure the
              companies would close down within 1 month of your taking over.</p>
              <p>So, stop wasting bandwidth please. I'd rather ignore rubbish
              than be tricked into reading rubbish.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, I agree that public transport here is still on the whole,

              <p>Why is SMRT still passing up the chance to purchase DDs? I don't

              <p>Don't need to talk about just buses...there are times when I try
              to take the train in the late morning and it is packed.
              Why? Because the train frequency was 8 min. They don't show 8 min
              by the way, they simply wait 2 - 3 min and then post 6 min on the
              screen.</p>
              <p>You're not even thinking when you post "stop wasting bandwidth"!
              At the very least you should be applying some critical thinking
              when you see complaints about the public transport. Complaints
              might appear easily, nonetheless they don't appear for no
              reasons.</p>

              <p>1. Costs must be factored in. A little a day might not seem a lot, but it adds up as time goes by. It really depends on your priorities. Its either your time, energy, or your money and if you lack $$, why should it be a case of "its simply too bad for you"?</p>
              <p>2. The retort to this is simple, SMRT still has to start somewhere right?...As difficult as it may sound, if they don't even start then we'll get no where. At the same time I don't get why LTA is interfering with the choice of buses for SG roads as far as bendies are concerned but that's another thing altogether. So if SMRT refuses to do anything about having nothing but SDs, we're not going to do anything either?</p>
              <p>3. Late morning is off-peak. But with the 8 min frequency it doesn't look like off-peak at all with crowds of people waiting at the NS/NE and EW/NS interchanges. Strong indication of chronic shortage of resources. I'm not buying the loads of crap about MRT infrastructures being unable to support better infrastructure because the CCL and DTL turned out to be down-sized when they had the chance to up-size. Recalling the complaints years ago about MRTs being too small, LTA replied that its too late and costly to do anything about the NS/EW/NE lines. And now they gave us the CCL. Maybe the demand projected might not be there, but who can really tell? Are they going to give the same reason years later?</p>
              <p>4. I haven't really noticed that. Incidentally I am one of those mentioned. Perhaps the reason is that we tend to compare with SBST. Honestly, even those SMRT svcs whose frequencies are pretty ok, and considered very good pales in comparison to comparable SBST svcs. 190 of course is an exception. I do take SMRT svcs every now and then and I do get fed up waiting for SMRT buses. Svcs like 965, 854 which are considered to be better in terms of waiting time still lags in frequency compared to say 161 and 25, 55. If I feel like hoping onto 189 to makan at West Coast Plaze or the hawker centre, I have to make a very good case to persuade my friends because my friends REALLY hate waiting for SMRT buses. The same goes for 171 if we have to get to town.</p>
              <p>Then again, these are my perceptions of SMRT and it is in my view that its services in general is really not up-to-scratch and will likely see even more strain with the increasing population pressure. Yes. It is still better than say...up north, where public buses can get caught in jams within interchanges if even possible. But one has to remember our population density.</p>
              <p>Hopefully all these is taken in the right spirit and not get tarred with the same brush as "mere complaints of complain kings/queens".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: Oh yea, forgot to add....but can SMRT do a better job cleaning the interior of the bus? Or are they waiting for the refurbishment exercise and the scrapping to do away with the heaps of dusts?</p>

              <p>Ignore these people, seriously. They think that they are really smart then let them be. In their point of view, simply buying good buses means that the bus operator is the best of the best already, not good bus services. Rather lame.</p>

              <p>It all boils down whether the authorities that wants to make the depots DD friendly. If LTA is really serious about vamping up the public bus services here, it should have helped SMRT to build or upgrade depots to be DD friendly, since they are the one who ban bendy buses in the first place. By clipping SMRT's choice of large capacity buses, LTA should at least help to allow their depots to take in the only choice of larger capacity buses, which is the DDs.</p>
              <p>And who says that only SBST can buy DDs only??? Is there a law that states that SBST is the only operator that can buy DDs??? And take note that the bus stops along the Woodlands MRT lines are DD friendly and they are built a decade back, and they are in the so called "non SBST territory". However to the purchase of DDs for SMRT eventually, it still depends on the company itself, which I am rather unhappy of the thought that the company itself also have that kind of screwed mindset, just like some of the people here who thinks that SBST can only buy DDs and SMRT can only buy bendy buses.</p>
              <p>Another good example of LTA half hearted efforts in listening to commuters' feedbacks/suggestions/complaints and improving public bus system, is the WAB bus episode. As discussed in a thread long ago, LTA half hearted approaches causes a lot of unhappiness for wheelchair bound bus commuters, simply the reason, the bus stop cannot cater for them, since it is WAB bus unfriendly. Bus operators took a serious and faster approach to buy in bulk of such WAB buses, but till then or even now, not even 80% of the bus stops here are WAB bus friendly, where bus operators have almost 40% to 60% WAB buses in their fleet, and in the next few years. Worse still, their declared WAB services are not even 30% of all the bus services in Singapore. If they are really serious about making public buses friendly to wheelchair bound commuters, they should have at least complete the works of upgrading at least 90% of bus stops here by now to be WAB bus and wheelchair bound friendly. I don't even see the need to declare WAB bus services, just allow the wheelchair bound passengers to board the bus whenever available. Instead they rather waste the money and time to install the poorly designed bus number poles islandwide first. </p>
              <p>Last good example, Changi Airport bus terminal. If LTA is serious about public buses, why is the design of Changi Airport bus terminal DD/bendy bus unfriendly??? It is either the narrow roads or else the limited heights. All these aspects are controllable and adjustable, but again LTA simply won't care. Why make the bus terminal underground anyway??? Is there something disgraceful about public buses???</p>
              <p>Just look at other airports, like the ones in Hong Kong, DDs can ply without constraints, that is called world class transportation, one of the open eye to foreigners when they first stepped into a country. If Changi Airport is really public bus friendly, SBST do not need to deploy so many manpower and buses in services 24 and 27 and DDs can ply on these services for a more optimum operations. Same goes to 858, people will have more chances for a seat in a bendy bus, rather to squeeze in a single deck.</p>

              <p>1. Costs must be factored in. A little a day might not seem a lot, but it adds up as time goes by. It really depends on your priorities. Its either your time, energy, or your money and if you lack $$, why should it be a case of "its simply too bad for you"?</p>
              <p>2. The retort to this is simple, SMRT still has to start somewhere right?...As difficult as it may sound, if they don't even start then we'll get no where. At the same time I don't get why LTA is interfering with the choice of buses for SG roads as far as bendies are concerned but that's another thing altogether. So if SMRT refuses to do anything about having nothing but SDs, we're not going to do anything either?</p>
              <p>3. Late morning is off-peak. But with the 8 min frequency it doesn't look like off-peak at all with crowds of people waiting at the NS/NE and EW/NS interchanges. Strong indication of chronic shortage of resources. I'm not buying the loads of crap about MRT infrastructures being unable to support better infrastructure because the CCL and DTL turned out to be down-sized when they had the chance to up-size. Recalling the complaints years ago about MRTs being too small, LTA replied that its too late and costly to do anything about the NS/EW/NE lines. And now they gave us the CCL. Maybe the demand projected might not be there, but who can really tell? Are they going to give the same reason years later?</p>
              <p>4. I haven't really noticed that. Incidentally I am one of those mentioned. Perhaps the reason is that we tend to compare with SBST. Honestly, even those SMRT svcs whose frequencies are pretty ok, and considered very good pales in comparison to comparable SBST svcs. 190 of course is an exception. I do take SMRT svcs every now and then and I do get fed up waiting for SMRT buses. Svcs like 965, 854 which are considered to be better in terms of waiting time still lags in frequency compared to say 161 and 25, 55. If I feel like hoping onto 189 to makan at West Coast Plaze or the hawker centre, I have to make a very good case to persuade my friends because my friends REALLY hate waiting for SMRT buses. The same goes for 171 if we have to get to town.</p>
              <p>Then again, these are my perceptions of SMRT and it is in my view that its services in general is really not up-to-scratch and will likely see even more strain with the increasing population pressure. Yes. It is still better than say...up north, where public buses can get caught in jams within interchanges if even possible. But one has to remember our population density.</p>
              <p>Hopefully all these is taken in the right spirit and not get tarred with the same brush as "mere complaints of complain kings/queens".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Edit: Oh yea, forgot to add....but can SMRT do a better job cleaning the interior of the bus? Or are they waiting for the refurbishment exercise and the scrapping to do away with the heaps of dusts?</p>

              <p>I agree with most of your points here.</p>
              <p>But remember, better frequencies comes with longer run time for each journey as well. 851 is a good example, better frequencies but slower trips and many of SBST services.</p>
              <p>Point 3:</p>
              <p>If CCL and DTL do not even justify the loads, then there is no need to even build them. It simply wasting resources. Having a good network of bus services is sufficient enough, and is even more cost effective than rails. But then, why build all these lines in the first place, many Singaporeans know. It's not about public transport, it's about the economy instead.</p>
              <p>The bottomline is : cannot cope then don't increase the population like running tap water. No wonder more Singaporeans are leaving.</p>

              <p>sbst275, I cannot agree with you here.</p>
              <p>Many people worked hard because they want a better life here. Being able to afford to buy their own house and car is the most simplest form of need that a family can make do. It is simply a selfish thought that Singapore cannot squeeze in more vehicles and they have to squeeze in everyday in public transport. Public transport is effective for curbing peak hour jams, but is it effective for family bonding in the long run??? Stop this population increase and overcrowding and give Singaporeans a basic decent living instead. No wonder Sinagporeans are leaving...</p>

              <p><br>You are actually wrong. I'm not. And many of the people I knew living in SMRT areas are unhappy about their bus services, grouses and complaints ranging from very dirty/poorly maintained buses to irregular frequencies to inadequate bus services. However some still hope that bus services there can improve, some hope SBST can come and serve them, but I haven't really hear that they want to move out because they use certain kind of buses, or poor services. Some say they rather drive, no hope to see.</p>
              <p>By giving such substandard services do not do them any good. Cannot cope, limited resources and buses, then give up some bus services to SBST or another better bus company. Concentrate on a smaller scale for better services Don't hog and struggle with the services where you can't even cope properly, in the end, who suffers, the commuters who pay money for the medicore services.</p>

              <p><br>Well, it is known to all Singaporeans already. No money, no talk. This is how the society goes. Singaporeans have already gave up on this society. If you observe the ones around you, they just want to work hard to earn more money for their family and themselves. Others they really don't care much nowadays.</p>
              <p>For your info, many of these road infrastructures, especially the big ones, are planned even a decade ahead. Take example the NS expressway in Singapore, the idea was already out in the early 2000s. It just takes time for feasibility tests, cost/operations/construction considerations and consider the way our system works here, many of them gets delayed for years and years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you can't compare Singapore in the 70s/80s/90s with now. Our population density wasn't very very bad those times. Now the population increase here is like without any proper control, so now you see more traffic jams than in the 90s, even you see public transport is even more packed than 10 years ago. Everyday when I go to work or knock off from work, it is always the scene, the "sian" scene; cars on roads, traffic jams, bus crowded to commuters till the doors, MRT packed with people like sardines. Packed and crowded, packed and crowded.</p>
              <p>But don't compare Singapore and Malaysia in that way. The way that our upper management works are totally different. I don't care how other countries' government works, at least their people are happier than us, or not least.</p>
              <p>Dubai is rescuduling its debt repayments again, tens of millions. I don't really care how much it can affect SMRT but I do hope that this will not bring the whole world into another recession again.</p>

              <p>Beg to differ about CCL/DTL being useless....its really one heck of a boon for me once it comes up and I forsee a lot of people seeing that way.</p>

              <p>But here's the not-so-good part, CCL is down-sized, what if the day I decide that I might as well sacrifice a bit of $$ and time and make the switch back to my usual way of travelling because there's simply too many people taking CCL?

A lot of people are likely to think along the same lines as me and might not take up the CCL route.</p>
              <p>I would come back to find either the bus I used to take rationalised, or at best, have its frequency cut. And then I would find myself getting kiap between crowded train and unreliable shuttle, and the crowded bus with cut frequency.</p>
              <p>Where will that leave me??</p>

              <p>It all boils down whether the authorities that wants to make the
              depots DD friendly. If LTA is really serious about vamping up the
              public bus services here, it should have helped SMRT to build or
              upgrade depots to be DD friendly, since they are the one who ban
              bendy buses in the first place. By clipping SMRT's choice of large
              capacity buses, LTA should at least help to allow their depots to
              take in the only choice of larger capacity buses, which is the
              DDs.</p>
              <p>And who says that only SBST can buy DDs only??? Is there a law
              that states that SBST is the only operator that can buy DDs??? And
              take note that the bus stops along the Woodlands MRT lines are DD
              friendly and they are built a decade back, and they are in the so
              called "non SBST territory". However to the purchase of DDs for
              SMRT eventually, it still depends on the company itself, which I am
              rather unhappy of the thought that the company itself also have
              that kind of screwed mindset, just like some of the people here who

              <p><br>Well, even if the younger generation is willingly to cooperate, will our buses also need to cope with the higher capacity as well, especially when the population increase is not properly controlled??? Look at the MRT, it is already over capacitied, even as most people had to squeeze like a sardine in a train. And don't forget, don't put assumptions that only the younger generation are selfish ones who display bad habits of disrupting public transport operations. Look at the articles posted here, even aunites like to hog one place of their seats with their bags and standing on exit doors, uncles put their legs on the seats to sleep, even ang mos who put their legs with shoes on the seats adjecent to them.</p>
              <p>And looking the way how our system works here, do you think that our public transport will go very far in future??? The bottomline is: profits are still more important. In 1996, the White Paper says about First Class transport system here. Now is it even one??? It can be achieved somehow, if the population increase is controlled and even stop to make such plans feasible. Anyway, in Singapore, private transport is still a need here, to allow those better off Singaporeans to reduce the overcrowding situations in public transport and so private and public transport still needs to compliement with each other for our transportation system woes here, especially in overcrowding Singapore.</p>
              <p>But I agree with you on the points on bendy buses here. Singapore is just too densely populated to have such things here, unlike Europe.</p>

              <p>That is how the system works. If the load cannot justify the building of a rail system, then don't build it. Don't give commuters a half committed service in one mode in the end, be it a bus or a train. Bus service can be very efficient and flexible if the authorities are really serious about providing one. Remember the guided bus system??? It is more cost effective and flexible than rails and changes can be made easily if demand changes, unlike rail, once build, you need to have the demand, else will lose a lot of money.</p>
              <p>And in order to have the demand, you may even have to "force establish" that demand, by building more densely populated buildings near the place, sacrificing our heritage, be it green or historical, and by withdrawing bus routes without considering the effects after that. Let's take the recent property boom as an example.</p>
              <p>I just hate it when they "so called" rationalisation of bus routes when a new lines comes up. In the end, I am left with lesser choices instead. And rails are inflexible because in the end, when the rail fails, you still have to take a bus in the end. </p>

              <p>I agree, tat's why I've ever told some through PM abt bold changes to bus routing. In some sense, current mainly trunk and feeder only dun work in e long run cos of many factors i.e. no of bus stop to serve, travelling time issues.</p>
              <p>But I think bigger buses surely can solve part of the capacity issues.</p>
              <p>As for Singaporean typical behaviour, can't be helped. but as long as it does not occur during peak hrs, sometimes just let it be la.. siam</p>
              <p>As for CCL, 3 carriage to serve NUS + Alexandra/ PSA Bldg crowd w/o buses? must be joking</p>
              <p>Now suddenly I rmbr something abt cross border svs. Are they looking into limited schedule express svs (not tat SJE or CW2 type) for areas such as Pasir Ris? Trunk svs think should remain at Kranji</p>
