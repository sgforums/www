            <div class='col-md body'>That is highly impossible as the public bus operator industry is too small to accomodate a 3rd bus operator which will eat into profits of SBS Transit and SMRT and the same old story goes again where the government will question if there is too much competition... Besides, Bus Plus is under SMRT now and mainly caters to commuters willing to have a "higher-class" bus transport and moreover, why would SMRT want to introduce Bus Plus as a 3rd bus operator to compete with its TIBS?</div>

Nah, absolutely impossible.<br><br>First, BusPlus is an exclusive express service designed and catered for the middle-to-upper class commuters. Hence the slogan "Business Class On The Roads". Bear in mind also that BusPlus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TIBS. As you can see right now, TIBS is closing down CSS, which can be considered as a "low-fare" bus company. For BusPlus, which is serving a different market than CSS, to take over the CSS bus operations is illogical.<br><br>Secondly, it is technically impossible for the minibuses to be fitted with 2 doors, let alone an outswing plug door! The buses already has the EDS installed. And again, BusPlus serves a different niche than the trunk services. BusPlus does operates a couple of so-called "recreation services", though it is more of a shuttle service. Among them are:- Bugis MRT-Big Splash &amp; Tampines MRT-Loyang Fish Farm.<br><br>Lastly, when you say remake, what do you actually mean? It is rather sound to say SBST should buy NEW articulated buses, like the Scania L94UA or the Volvo B12 artic. And the authorities have called upon SBST and TIBS to purchase ONLY low floor buses for their fleet. For their diecast models, SBST- can be bought during their coffee evenings as well as from their Corporate Communications Department. As for TIBS, I don't think it is available even as we speak. I'm still eagerly waiting for their release of the Habit Diecast Model.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards<br></div>

I assumed that actually meant BusPlus should install the system on the EXISTING fleet, which again is technically impossible.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards[/b]</div>
