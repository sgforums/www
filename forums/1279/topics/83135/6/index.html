It's the most direct route for residents of Clementi Ave 4 and Sunset Way estate (a pedestrian bridge links Sunset Way estate with Clementi Ave 4). For the Sunset Way residents living near to Clementi Ave 4, taking service 284 is much faster than taking services 154 or 184.<br><br>When services 282 and 287 merged in the 80s, residents along Clementi West St 2 complained that their journey time was increased. So, in 1990, with the shortening of service 189, the service provided the former service 287 fast link between Clementi town centre/MRT station and Clementi West St 2.</div>
