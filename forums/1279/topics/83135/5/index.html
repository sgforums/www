            <div class='col-md body'>REASOn iS DAmm SImple.. 88 do not ply Upp Serangoon Rd.. after Punggol Park, it turn right into Hougang AVe 8.. for 136, it uses Upp Serangoon Rdall the way.. it doesnt ply Punggol Rd At All.. (xcept for a very small part before TPE..) for 82, it uses Punggol Rd all the way from Punggol End.. except the part when it turn into the Punggol Central.. other than that, it ply the whole of Punggol Rd.. which can get quite crowded at times especially before and after school.. that is the reason why ppl choose 82 and not 136...<br></div>

Because from my 4 years at secondary school in Bishan, I notice that in 2001, service 410 has deployed older double decks + single decks aircon. I believe passengers won't mind if there's non-aircon double decks because there's more seating space. If there's overhead bridges which does not allow double-deckers then can't help. Passengers have to suffer under this sardine-can situation then.<br><br>There had been a few times when at TPY interchange, I was waiting for 231W but the queue for 231G is empty. Then one 231G will drive by, then leave the berth. After a while the queue for 231G has only a few passengers (can count with a hand) but 231W queue already stretch into 163/157 area. Then another 231G come together with 231W. I suspect something's wrong with the timetabling..</div></blockquote>Even if there is overhead Bridge, DD bus still can drive through it.. the height limit of the bridges in Singapore is 4.5m.. while all the DD buses that SBS uses is 4.4m.... so.. it shouldnt be a problem driving through it..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
