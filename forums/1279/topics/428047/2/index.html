              <p>cJust wondering, tyre 'botak'(still left abit of running life),
              can SL request to swap for another bus? Or will the company ask
              them drive for one day then upon return request for tyre
              change?</p>
              <p>Anyway not checking coolant/engine oil level is a serious bad
              habit which can lead to vehicle engine seizures, vehicle
              overheating and even engine fire. I ever rode a motorbike that is
              in poor condition and i dont even dare run beyond 70km/h because
              the engine is freaking hot, almost burnt my leg when i accidentally
              touch it, which i touched the gearbox, not the engine and can smell
              the hot burnt engine oil. My friend encountered same situation and
              continue to run at high speed, before seizing the engine.</p>

              <p>Even one tyre botak you have the right to change the bus.This is
              what i'm been practicing during my driving bus days.If the
              mechanics insist it can go on service then ask them to sign behind
              your waybill card.Just a reference if mishap happens.I always ngiao
              one,See bus body bend also i go report.AC not cold also change
              bus.I've ever drive a heated Lance cause the bloody mechanic ask me
              to drive it while on 980,Reach Lor 1 top up water again until i
              finally declared cant go on service after seeking BOCC advice,Block
              gaskets leaking and radiator hose a bit cracked.Did manage to save
              that bus though..Bus get new hoses and parts wear replaced.Wonder
              what is the perm SL doing??</p>

              <p>What the... holy frak, the mechanics at the bus depots were pressing buses with such severe problems into service? What the frak are they thinking?</p>
              <p>Also, there are drivers who don't do their first parade? No wonder the odd SMRT bus I ride has funny problems sometimes. How are they managing to get away with skipping such a crucial safety procedure?</p>

              <p>Aha! No wonder a few years back, I encountered a situaution on SBS 2888T (it was already part of Bedok North Depot, but was still on passenger service) where the air-conditioner didn't seem to work properly and eventually broke down.</p>
              <p>Damn... these mechanics really don't seem to be serious and committed to their jobs at all. When someone feeds back to them that something's wrong with a bus, it's their responsibility to check out the problem and fix it; what the frak is wrong with them? Maybe that's why some bus drivers skip the first parade - they had rather not look at the faces of those mechanics...</p>
              <p>I wonder, does the upper management knows about this, and if so, what are they doing about it?</p>
