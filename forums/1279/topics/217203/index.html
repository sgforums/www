            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Engine </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leyland</strong></span> - Cummins Engine. The most headache engine I have in hand. The Cyld head is in one whole block. That means if you want to replace 1 cyld head for weak valve springs or just 1 damaged valve, you have to replace all 6 cylinder head at one go. And you need a floor crane to do it. Waste time waste labour waste money.<br><br>The FIP is a pressure timing pump. The only good point is that the FIP do not need to catch engine timing to replace. The bad points are that it relies on a dump valve to prevent fuel flow back. So as to maintain pressure to prevent air lock. So it helps to cut off the pressure. There is a solenoid fuel valve in front to help allow fuel in or cut off fuel. If the dump valve is not working, it will not allow ample pressurised fuel into the fuel valve to start operation. That means the bus has a max speed of &lt;10KM/H. And this always happens. This month alone I had 2 cases. One of them on 9056 and the other on 9060. I know there're more than these 2 cases. And turbo chargers are very problematic. Last time there were quite a number of fire and smoke cases with Turbo chargers. To us, not even the slightest smoke is tolerable. With this kind of high expectations, my other colleague who's in charge of turbo chargers always keep high alert on such items. But for Volvo, we're more at ease.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Volvo</strong></span> - 6 cyld Volvo engine. All 6 cyld are individual. That means you only need to replace one if need be during a top overhaul. Simple straight forward and easy to do. Saves on money, labour and down time. No need floorcrane. FIP is very straight forward. Though the FIP design is complicated like the MB0405, the breakdown rate on this is very rare.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mercedes Benz</strong></span> - The legendary MB0405 is so easy to fix. Likewise with Volvo, the cyld head is same in design. Except the engine is somewhat like a boxer engine. Horizontally lying down. Both Volvo and Mercedes need to catch engine timing. If the wrong timing is caught, the bus can crank but cannot start. But engine timing is basic maintenance skills of technicians. Not a problem at all.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Front axle</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Leyland</strong></span> - The only insane design I have ever seen. Incorporated the front axle design of a small car for the use of a large heavy weight commercial bus. The most problematic @##$% axles I have come across. Leylands have more axle breakdowns than any other buses. The front axle wheel hub bearing is lubricated by grease!!!! What the?! Everybody else is using proper engine oil or GL5 to lubricate which helps to reduces heat and better permeability. But Leyland uses grease?! Grease melts around constant 120DegC to 150DegC. But Oils do not. When grease melts, it leaks out and also loses the properties of a grease. Then the wheel bearing once loses lubrication will be at risk of shattering. I have to upgrade the grease to an extremely high graded grease to prevent this problem from coming. Also periodically call back the bus and replace the grease off and on to prevent the wheel from flying off. God knows how much money I've wasted on this. Grease is talking about thousands per drum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mercedes &amp; Volvo</strong></span> - Wheel hub is lubricated by engine oil. No problem at all. Wheel hub oil seal can leak. But this only happens once in a blue moon. Until now I have only seen 1 time in my 1 year plus of work. Even when in the SAF with MAN trucks, I ave seen less than 5 times even with the crazy SAF styled driving over super terrains.<br><br>There're many more I can explain which will cover the whole page. God saves Soon Lee with Volvos... Haha.... I hope the time when Leylands go to the scrap yard come quickly.[/u]</div>

Good bus fare prices = branded high end stuffs that helps to ensure you get from pont to point in one piece. (even though many of the public do not know it because most public are laymen to the automotive engineering sector.) And original parts doesn't mean the best. Sometimes, I may have to spend even more in order to bring the best goods into workshop for use so as to guarantee the highest degree of engineering quality.

But I have received feedback from the Training center's Training Officer that Scania engines are very lasting. The CDGE Technical Officer also told me the same story.

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a very simple reason why SBST can;t buy Leylands anymore<br><br>this is because Leyland has closed down and got taken over by Volvo in 1994. in fact be proud that our LO3x are the very last production unit chasis in the worlds.!!!<br><br>ZYX</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stooper:</div><div class="quote_body">Interesting... Is that any indication for the dump valve not working properly? Like a loud sound just before it breaks down or something?<br><br>And what exactly is an axle breakdown? Is there any indciations of it as well?<br><br>And by smoke, you mean fire from the engine or just the very black exhaust gas?</div></blockquote>Like I said vehicle max speed drops drastically to &lt;10km/h. Lack of power. Cannot climb slopes if for Svc 179. But easy to start and crank. Which shows nothing wrong to electrical aspect.<br><br>Axle breakdown means noisy and bus veers left right easily while driving. Also lack of power as the pineapple gears in the axle has lost the mechanical efficiency thus unable to effectively transmit mechanical power via the gears to run the wheels. You can learn mechanical efficiency from Mechanical engineering courses or physics.<br><br>Actually to SBST smoke case means smoke appears in places that're not supposed to. And this is taken very very seriously. The numbers have greatly improved but many of the public do not know so they say SBST service never improve which is not true at all. We're aiming at zero of such cases all year round. On the other hand, black exhaust could likely be FIP, injectors, exhaust pipe dirty, cylinder head need to do valve clearance or top overhaul package.<br><br>Even though I make it an effort to join the ground to conduct repairs sometimes though on paper I'm not required to, what I know is only the tip of the iceberg. Everything is not as assumed by most public perceived it to be. Even our own operations depratments also find that workshops are fascinating. They can walk though the workshop and ask around the whole day and still find surprises everyday the next few weeks.</div>

In a bid to reduce costs, we overhaul our own engines. Some done by own depot some done by CDGE. But I insist on letting CDGE do it because we pay for a neat sum of &gt;$15K for a Volvo B10M engine that covers a total overhaul package and running in. Also 1 year warranty. Engine overhaul is the easiest to me amongst the 4 major components Engine, axle, gearboxes and diff unit. But still it is something that only professionals in this line with proper specs can do. After overhauling, we need to run in the engine. In my case, the engines are run in by CDGE to achieve optimum results. I cannot possibly get the BC to run in for me.<br><br>I have read about hard run in when I visited other forums like the local bike forums but what I can say is that those are crap. You ask any professional in this line who's not any dida-apa 'professional' from some forum rubbish will always tell you to run in according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Specific technical details will go into long story. So whoever interested can PM me for details or meet up sessions.<br><br>You are sitting next to the engine if you take the last row of the lower deck's seat. When moving, more heat is emitted because the engine works and stronger combustion will bring about more heat. But when stopped, the hot air gets staled though lesser heat generated, you still feel almost the same amount of heat. Either ways there's always heat. But I assure that there's no harm sitting on the five seater though it's nearest to the engine. If you dun like the idea of being next to the engine, you can choose the upper deck front seats. Furtherest away from all heat sources.</div>
