            <div class='col-md body'>Today I boarded Sv 39 (MK4 SBS 2829 something ) and this Indian bus driver was driving the bus really fast. On Tampines Ave 2 towards Yishun something flagged the bus REALLY late, and he quickly swerved left and stopped just where the bus lane for the bus stop ended. Luckily it was one of those bus stops where the bus lane was really long.<br><br>Later he closed the doors just after I stepped down....</div>

Its SBS2829 on my darling svc, cos its the only perm mk 5 with an indian driver! SBST drivers are given only a maximum of 45mins to chiong from Tampines to Yishun to compete with svc 969. Those in doubt ( u noe who u are ) are welcome to check out the driver's timetables.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go try 856 driven by this Indian driver. I got his name but I won't put it down here to protect privacy.<br><br>The bus departs WRI at approximately 5.35pm in the evenings. Normally he drives a Habit (I took TIB1244P and TIB1040K with him at the helm).<br><br>At the bus stop, even before the doors closes fully, he is already accelerating out of the bus bay and I figured he is driving at more than 60km/h along Admiralty Rd West, due to the lack of passengers at that time, so you can imagine the bouncing of the trailer given the ups and downs of Admiralty Rd West. I was on TIB1244P when he executed a high speed turning from Senoko Rd to Senoko Drive. When I got off TIB1244P at Canberra Road, I could smell the brakepads burning too.</div>
