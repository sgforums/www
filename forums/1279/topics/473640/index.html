              It's the first time for me to post here and I am a bus enthusiast from Hong Kong. I recently have been to Singapore and seen this forum, which I think that the bus enthusiasts in Singapore always follow instructions and play safely. But I am curious that what do Singaporeans think about Hong Kong bus enthusiasts?
              
              When the non-air conditionered buses retiried, hundreds of bus enthusiasts in Hong Kong went for the last 'hotdog' bus during midnight. Maybe some of us were over-enthusiastic, we screamed and ran after the bus in the bus interchange.
              
              Also some of us really like to take photos of buses, which they sometimes even stand in the middle of the road when there are many traffic passing by.
              
              Anyway there is no offense to any side, but just want to know what Singaporeans think about us. Thanks for reading! If I post in the wrong page, sorry for that.
              
              P.S.  I love the 2-axle Volvo Olympians :)

              <p>Just being honest here[hope it doesn't sounds offending], I feel that you guys somewhat abit overboard in the behaviour, especially the farewell hotdogs period. I mean who isn't in love with them? But I felt that there could be better behaviour onboard, and noting that it's a public service afterall. </p>
              <p>And regards to standing on road photography, I'm unsure how's the area like in HK, but I feel that there's not a need to stand on road, risking ur life, just to snap something. I don't think it's quite worth it. </p>

              <p>I think that HK bus enthusiasts are really passionate on buses. I mean, there are just so much more for them to discover! Lots of new types of buses every year, while we SG have to tahan the loads of KUB and Wrights etc. </p>
              <p>However, HK enthusiasts can practice better courtesy in forums and dont keep scolding diu Lei Lo mo and stuff. I have been to HK forums and they do scold that do quite often when they get excited. Sorry to Hongkongers. </p>
