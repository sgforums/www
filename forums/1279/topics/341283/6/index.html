              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I prefer the OC500LE (Aka orcs (for those who dig WarCraft or DOTA) , OCs, Oh 500 ) <br><br>Dun fancy Scania K2304X2UB ( Aka K230UB, KUB, Scarn-niah, Singapore 5th gen Scanaiz...)</p>
              <p>heres why,</p>
              <p><strong>Looks</strong><br>OC: Like the Capacity front. Just wished the medal-like Merc logo part cna be accentuauted with more glassed area to enhance the Mercedes 3 point star in its plith medal hanging style.. Bascially convert front area of blackness to full Capapcity bodywork style.  The SMRTbus lofgo should be moved to bottem left to improve the look of the bus front. <br><br>On comparison without the painted V part, the bus does into somewhat look like a Citaro gen 2 front with its cruved edge big front window area and the plith concept of Mercedes for housing their 3 point star.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>KUB: I dun fancy the front. Not really Omnnicity. some say it is but i dun see the resmebblance. Still smiley front are brighten the day and the KUB do look nice</p>
              <p>OC wins because of closeness to other Merc orginal bodywork products.</p>
              <p><strong>riding the bus:</strong><br>OC - kinda jerky with the disc brakes. however Mercedes retarders are world reknowned and a ride on SMB4 of 851 proved the usefulness of a WORKING retarder. The SL manged to start braking for a trafwick light from 500m out. he basically lifted his foot of the pedal and let the bus roll,</p>
              <p>As usual the gear lock happened but not as jerky as a KUB. then the retarder kicked in. This brought the bus to an almost full stop, the bus was still moving on at 4km/h with SL not doing anything, the NBS of Mercedes then kicked right in, forcing the bus to a gentle stop. I have never had NBS kick in while bus was going 2km/h so it was a real cool effect and treat for me. <br><br>OC slowing down assisted technologies - A+<br><br>The OC do still have a slight jerk when shifting gears, but not as jerky. Probably a right bodywork of Gemilang to use so bus not too heavy or light for engine power. Not much rattling for some squeaking can be heard but who says Mercs Citaros dun squeak and rattle either...</p>
              <p>KUB: this one ahh u know lah. like many of u have mntioned.<br>OC wins<br><br><strong>Noise level</strong><br>OC - tend to be quiet when idle such that u hear air-con whizzing sound only. But the hypoids when at 6th gear are rather irritating. Wished they were hubs instead. <br><br>KUB: engine fan loud. Hypoid at 6th loud. Not very civilised for a Scannia product. I would however note that Scania engines are world reknown to be quiet. Does S'Pore KUB live up to the Scania brand?</p>
              <p>OC wins<br><br><strong>accleration-</strong><br>OC: vs KUB: as dave emntioned 299PS vs 230PS , i daresay mec wins. however a cautious driver drivng an OC will leave the engine humming rather stressfully with funny pitches, which happens on jammed roads. Causes weird gut sensations for me.</p>
              <p> This means the bus move well at higher rpm ranges which can be hit at higher speeds. the full out chiong OC will illusatrate the lovely engine hum pitch. However Sl's shd be cautiuos as to where and when to full out chiong the OC, much braking is needed on these Singapore congested roads if one dares to chiong.</p>
              <p><br>The Sl will have to know when to brake and brake fast but gently using disc brakes. In some cases the retarder will have not helped much at all. OCs really do cruise at 60km.h and it is hard to bring the bus to a stop in a graceful manner. <br><br>the KUb hum pitch hits even ptich at lower speeds but it leaves me frsutrated that the bus is going 60km/h but displaying signs of a 120km./ kind of low engine hum like a K124EB. dun feel the power. 230PS mah...like that lor.. 230PS however it IS highly optimal on Singapore congested roads. so right choice of 230HP. however when one needs the rush, you can't have it.  </p>
              <p>OC: wins because i like my adrenalin supply on such fast rides.l..ike the rush.....hahah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Engine sound - down to the basic engine<br>OC - kind of MAN like but mixed with Scania L113CRLsound. sounds very close to a Citaro due to engine specs and i luv Citaros.<br><br>KUB - typcial Scania. however the 5th series engine sound too Neoplan ish (a well maintained NeoPlan)  For Scania i prefer 4th series engine sounds. meanning i dun dig 5th series scannia engines.</p>
              <p>So OC wins.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Overall - OC wins<br><br>ZYX</p>

              <p>OC: wins because i like my adrenalin supply on such
              fast rides.l..ike the rush.....hahah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Engine sound - down to the basic engine<br> OC - kind of MAN like but mixed with Scania L113CRLsound. sounds
              very close to a Citaro due to engine specs and i luv Citaros.<br> <br> KUB - typcial Scania. however the 5th series engine sound too
              Neoplan ish (a well maintained NeoPlan)  For Scania i prefer
              4th series engine sounds. meanning i dun dig 5th series scannia
              engines.</p>
              <p>So OC wins.</p>

              <p>OT: A KUB BC attemped to race with a OC500LE SL, BC choing a little, SL slow down and make gap big big, den SL start accerlating and overtake the KUB in seconds, wonderful OC500LE speed.</p>

              <p>Hi all</p>
              <p>I prefer the OC500LE (Aka orcs (for those who dig WarCraft or
              DOTA) , OCs, Oh 500 )<br> <br> Dun fancy Scania K2304X2UB ( Aka K230UB, KUB, Scarn-niah, Singapore
              5th gen Scanaiz...)</p>
              <p>heres why,</p>
              <p><strong>Looks</strong><br> OC: Like the Capacity front. Just wished the medal-like Merc logo
              part cna be accentuauted with more glassed area to enhance the
              Mercedes 3 point star in its plith medal hanging style.. Bascially
              convert front area of blackness to full Capapcity bodywork
              style.  The SMRTbus lofgo should be moved to bottem left to
              improve the look of the bus front.<br> <br> On comparison without the painted V part, the bus does into
              somewhat look like a Citaro gen 2 front with its cruved edge big
              front window area and the plith concept of Mercedes for housing
              their 3 point star.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>KUB: I dun fancy the front. Not really Omnnicity. some say it is
              but i dun see the resmebblance. Still smiley front are brighten the
              day and the KUB do look nice</p>
              <p>OC wins because of closeness to other Merc orginal bodywork
              products.</p>
              <p><strong>riding the bus:</strong><br> OC - kinda jerky with the disc brakes. however Mercedes retarders
              are world reknowned and a ride on SMB4 of 851 proved the usefulness
              of a WORKING retarder. The SL manged to start braking for a
              trafwick light from 500m out. he basically lifted his foot of
              the pedal and let the bus roll,</p>
              <p>As usual the gear lock happened but not as jerky as a KUB. then
              the retarder kicked in. This brought the bus to an almost full
              stop, the bus was still moving on at 4km/h with SL not doing
              anything, the NBS of Mercedes then kicked right in, forcing the bus
              to a gentle stop. I have never had NBS kick in while bus was going
              2km/h so it was a real cool effect and treat for me.<br> <br> OC slowing down assisted technologies - A+<br> <br> The OC do still have a slight jerk when shifting gears, but not as
              jerky. Probably a right bodywork of Gemilang to use so bus not too
              heavy or light for engine power. Not much rattling for some
              squeaking can be heard but who says Mercs Citaros dun squeak and
              rattle either...</p>
              <p>KUB: this one ahh u know lah. like many of u have
              mntioned.<br> OC wins<br> <br> <strong>Noise level</strong><br> OC - tend to be quiet when idle such that u hear air-con whizzing
              sound only. But the hypoids when at 6th gear are rather irritating.
              Wished they were hubs instead.<br> <br> KUB: engine fan loud. Hypoid at 6th loud. Not very civilised for a
              Scannia product. I would however note that Scania engines are world
              reknown to be quiet. Does S'Pore KUB live up to the Scania
              brand?</p>
              <p>OC wins<br> <br> <strong>accleration-</strong><br> OC: vs KUB: as dave emntioned 299PS vs 230PS , i daresay mec wins.
              however a cautious driver drivng an OC will leave the engine
              humming rather stressfully with funny pitches, which happens on
              jammed roads. Causes weird gut sensations for me.</p>
              <p> This means the bus move well at higher rpm ranges which
              can be hit at higher speeds. the full out chiong OC will
              illusatrate the lovely engine hum pitch. However Sl's shd be
              cautiuos as to where and when to full out chiong the OC, much
              braking is needed on these Singapore congested roads if one dares
              to chiong.</p>
              <p><br> The Sl will have to know when to brake and brake fast but gently
              using disc brakes. In some cases the retarder will have not helped
              much at all. OCs really do cruise at 60km.h and it is hard to bring
              the bus to a stop in a graceful manner.<br> <br> the KUb hum pitch hits even ptich at lower speeds but it leaves me
              frsutrated that the bus is going 60km/h but displaying signs of a
              120km./ kind of low engine hum like a K124EB. dun feel the power.
              230PS mah...like that lor.. 230PS however it IS highly optimal on
              Singapore congested roads. so right choice of 230HP. however when
              one needs the rush, you can't have it.  </p>
              <p>OC: wins because i like my adrenalin supply on such
              fast rides.l..ike the rush.....hahah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Engine sound - down to the basic engine<br> OC - kind of MAN like but mixed with Scania L113CRLsound. sounds
              very close to a Citaro due to engine specs and i luv Citaros.<br> <br> KUB - typcial Scania. however the 5th series engine sound too

The BC was trying to bring the bus to a stop gently cos I can feel the slight braking. However, the bus continued rolling on until the BC couldnt take it and slammed on the brakes.

              <p>Ya you are right about the converting the front area of blackness below the windscreen to full Capapcity bodywork style. It'll look pretty mean /cool with more blacks in the front (tribute to the Habits's front). Later can rival 8030L XD</p>

              <p>Also, Mercedes-Benz engines are calibrated to even kilowatt figures.  The 12-litre OM 457 hLA is available in 185 kW (252 PS), 220 kW (299 PS), 260 kW (354 PS) and 300 kW (408 PS).<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</p>

              <p><strong>riding the bus:</strong><br> OC - kinda jerky with the disc brakes. however Mercedes retarders
                  are world reknowned and a ride on SMB4 of 851 proved the usefulness
                  of a WORKING retarder. The SL manged to start braking for a
                  trafwick light from 500m out. he basically lifted his foot of
                  the pedal and let the bus roll,</p>

              <p>I believe the retarders are working on all the OC500s...it's just if the SL knows how to use it properly. Try the morning shift 4A and the afternoon shift 4A to see a big difference (: (just to show that it isn't the bus, but the user of the bus).</p>
              <p>The afternoon shift SL for 4A is really good at the retarder. So far most of the rides on OCs I have taken were relatively jerky when the SL brakes because he isn't using the retarder properly.</p>
              <p>Those who want to experience a smooth ride on an OC should go try 4A on 851...as for timings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>To add on, there might be confusion within non-technical oriented bus fans that the commonly used metric horsepower = PS. In fact one PS is equal to 0.98 (to be exact 0.98632) horsepower. So in fact to say, a OM457hLA with a 220kW rating engine would translate to 299 horsepower (220000/735) and then on to 303PS (299/0.98). A Scania DC9 engine used on the K230UB would be of 230 horsepower and 233PS. These are exact terms which few people would go to the extent of stating that they are different, so I have came across the fact that PS = horsepower, and this includes the Mercedes Benz German site...</p>
              <p>PS stands for <span lang="de"><em>Pferdestärke </em>in German, which actually means horsepower in their own sense! However stating that a German horsepower and Metric (British) horsepower is different, I wonder if they eat the different types of grass (while on different side of the English Channel)! This of course would not be the case.</span></p>
              <p>To share more...</p>
              <p>There had been much confusion for the term 'horsepower' through the years. In the past when I have just touched technical, I always thought that a horsepower rating of an engine would mean a horse equivalent of power under the boot! Until later in school that I learnt a Singaporean would likely rate his horse (those at Kranji Race Course?) differently from a Russian, or an American, maybe in some cases between a pony and a strong race horse, or more accurately that the work that they can do is different!</p>
              <p>Hence nowadays, watt have became the standard unit in measuring vehicle performance, as so far that i know, it standardise the term of a horsepower which would differ from a metric one to a imperial one to maybe a Singaporean one.</p>
              <p>The unit of PS had been deemed obsolete by the EEC in 1992, but it can still be encountered frequently, especially in Japanese sources where I always have to do a slight conversion from PS to the metric horsepower. Slight difference only I guess.</p>
              <p>When rating an engine, there is also a difference of rated horsepower from the engine and actual output. Rated, and also known as brake horsepower (bhp), is what can be achieved in the labs, while actual conditions would vary. Just like the 'ideal' condition in a physics or chemistry lab experiment.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the insight Dave, we sure learn lots more about engines! :D</p>

              <p><br>Took 2 OC500 rides this week and realised that both buses (SMB 30Z &amp; SMB 9L respectively) have a sharp whirring sound from the engine whenever the bus is in motion, which previously could not be heard. As for the former, it is really loud and sharp and can even be heard from the outside while for the latter it is not as noticeable but I definitely could make out the same whirring sound from the engine while bus is in motion.</p>
              <p>Any explanations for that?</p>
              <p>On another note, SBS 8310D (K230) zoomed past me the other day and the engine sounded as if it was a tractor motor! There was a loud <em>grong-grong</em> sound from the engine and I nearly thought the engine had overheated or something. And similarly, cannot be heard previously (I took the same bus twice before which did not have this problem then). Is it due to some parts in the engine malfunctioning / going loose which caused this problem?</p>
