            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bus services to be improved, vehicle growth rate to be reviewed</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: With Singapore projecting a future population of 6.5 million, MPs have asked how the land transport system will cope.<br><br>MPs on Friday spoke bluntly on the transport problems already faced by the average Singaporean right now. And they fear these problems will get worse.<br><br>From 1997 to 2004, the road capacity in Singapore grew by 5% but the car population went up by 10% and daily car trips rose even more, by 23%.<br><br>This squeeze has not gone unnoticed.<br><br>Seah Kian Peng, MP for Marine Parade GRC, said: "Another friend who just came back from Australia, having spent three years there, said, 'Suddenly, I felt everywhere was so crowded! MRT is so full, even at 7am. And the roads are jammed with cars, even late at night at 7pm'."<br><br>MP Seng Han Thong zoomed in on drivers' main frustration when ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) increases are used to manage congestion.<br><br>"I hope it will make ERP more effective rather than make it more expensive," he said.<br><br>And now, with higher population figures projected, the GPC Chairman for Transport mirrored the concerns - in and outside the House.<br><br>"For this to happen without Singapore roads ending up in gridlocks, we need a major revamp of our land transport infrastructure. At the moment, we have more questions than answers," said Cedric Foo, GPC Chairman for Transport and MP for West Coast GRC.<br><br>Addressing the MPs' concerns, Transport Minister Raymond Lim agreed that we could not keep putting cars on the road.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "If we continue to allow 3% annual growth, our current vehicle population of 800,000 would increase by about 50% to about 1.2 million by 2020. It is clear that the current 3% annual growth rate cannot be maintained indefinitely, given our land constraint and a slower pace of road-building as Singapore becomes more built-up."<br><br>So that rate would be reviewed next year, he added.<br><br>More importantly, he said, public transport would have to become more attractive and usage increased.<br><br>"As part of our long-term planning for a future Singapore of 6.5 million population, we expect that we will need to at least double our current rail network of 138 km for a 50% increase in population," he said.<br><br>That means putting in the equivalent of at least seven North-East Lines, starting perhaps with a new 33-station Downtown Line.<br><br>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is completing its feasibility studies for this new Line that will link the eastern and north-western corridors to the Marina Bay.<br><br>Improving bus services is another big area.<br><br>Already, full-day bus lanes are being expanded to give more buses more priority on the roads.<br><br>The LTA will also roll out a system to display real-time bus information at selected bus-stops.<br><br>The trial will begin in the middle of this year.<br><br>A similar trial by the LTA ended in 2003 due to technological constraints and cost.<br><br>The display of real-time bus information at bus-stops will complement similar services provided by SBS Transit, but through mobile phones and its website.<br><br>TransitLink will also develop an electronic bus journey planner so that commuters can figure out how to get from Point A to Point B.<br><br>These measures go to the heart of commuters' top grouses - which are long waiting times at bus-stops and being unable to predict their travel times.<br><br>If these measures can be coupled with smoother flow on the road for buses, it would go a long way towards improving the overall quality of a bus journey.</div>
