These were partially offset by lower bis operating costs and a payment for rail commissioning costs from LTA. PBT for Advertisement Business of $13.2m was 31.55 or $6.1m lower than last year due to weak market conditions and keen competition. Other income of $5.1m was 54.9%or $1.8m higher than last year mainly due to rental incomefrom the lease of commercial space in North-East Line (NEL) MRT and Sengkang LRT stations, offset by lower investment income.<br><br>-----------<br><br>If they keep different accounts for both rail and bus, it may not justify an increase in bus fare. Should bus commuters cross subsidised trains passengers???<br><br>From its fanancial report, there is an increase of 41% in fuel cost to $54 638 000, SBST must not use that as an excuse to up bus fare! On the other hand, it should expain why is there a 92.6% jump in 'Others Operating Expenses' to $101 808 000 and what constitutes 'Others Operating Expenses'!!!<br><br>We must pre-empt any moves by our monopolised bus companies to up their bus or train fares.<br><br>Companies are now riding along better economic sentiments to up their charges.

People also take public transport in the weekend for leisure activities.<br><br>So in other words, its hard to boycott public transport services unless you own a car. But too bad youngsters like me are not qualified to drive a vehicle of any kind. Thus, we have no choice but to take the train or bus to get around Singapore. U cant expect us to ride on taxis right?</div>
