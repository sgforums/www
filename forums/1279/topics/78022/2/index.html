            <div class='col-md body'>Just something on what I observed over the years..<br><br>The way TIBS deploy buses is a little different from SBS Transit. Many can observe that SBS Transit has better buses for most trunk services and most feeder / Townlink services are single deckers (except a few) or with older buses.<br><br>Many of you would think, why TIBS feeders or Intratown services have all the new buses? The answer is simple. TIBS simply put buses onto services when they feel the need is there. Just for example, when the first Habit buses came into services, the services with high demands or without Bendy buses got it first, then slowly to other services with Bendy buses. Just like the case of service 811, the 122x, 123x and 124x buses are on it because they have the need when these new buses are put into services. The same logic applies to service 963 when it was rebranded Trunk from Express.<br><br>There are other circumstances where TIBS put buses to beef up bus services when the new buses are available for revenue services. Therefore the new buses ended up on the services.<br><br>Of course, there are many more circumstances which I do not know and some of them with same logic applied to SBS Transit, popular services get the newer buses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm From what i see from SBST on its deployment on the newest DDs (Trident and VSOs)<br><br>Tridents were initially deployed on high demand routes on 64 85 111 502 as reported in the news. I'm not sure if 80 was one of them. I'm not sure what buses they replace but i believe some SDs and older DDs were replaced by the Tridents. As with NEL and HGDEP deployments, Tridents went over to 80 as 80 is a super high demand route.
