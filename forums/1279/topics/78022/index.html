            <div class='col-md body'>Under -<br><br><strong>1. Service 72</strong><br>For the service with virtually the best frequency of all SBS trunk services, its fleet is not too good. Although it has a fair number of MK4s and a couple VSOs, most of its fleet is made out of O405s &amp; LO 3x.<br><br><strong>2. Service 19</strong><br>Popular among Tampines residents and packed throughout the route during peak hours and yet they dump all the old and noisy BNDEP scanias on it. They should upgrade it to a normal 18 hr service and put some MK3s or MK4s on it.<br><br><strong>3. Service 143</strong><br>I go to Thomson Rd every week, and demand for Sv 143 esp towards the city is huge. Was at HarbourFront yesterday and the number of people and one of its O405s was near overloading capacity. Really deserves better buses than only LO 3x &amp; O405s.<br><br><strong>4. Service 10</strong><br>A very long route winding through south Singapore, still it gets mostly old LO 3x ADDs plus a couple MK4s. Plus the occassional NAC Scania cameo. I really pity the driver who has to drive so long in a NAC bus.<br><br><strong>5. Service 3</strong><br>A very long winded route, should have some MK4s to replace some members of its Scania majority fleet, is this the longest route for the Scanias besides Sv 157?<br><br><strong>6. Service 38</strong><br>It gets overloaded much more often than Sv 18, still it gets Scanias &amp; MK3s. This maybe can loop at Bedok also, although it goes in circles it still isnt too long for the drivers.<br><br>Over -<br><br><strong>1. Service 291</strong><br>Need so many ADDs for what? Plus it gets MK4 cameos much more often that its cousin Sv 293.<br><br><strong>2. Service 18</strong><br>It does not need the two bendies, send them to a height restricted servide with high demand...like Sv 238 (well not really), Sv 131, Sv 124...<br><br><strong>3. Service 25</strong><br>Does it even need 9 VSOs? Demand on weekends and at night is not great.<br><br><strong>4. Service 81</strong><br>School bus service, other than school release hours you can see empty VOs &amp; MK4s.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys... you don't see things at one side, do you? As you can see, bus companies already have constraints in deploying buses to every services, let alone putting good buses on high demand services.

There is still Ayer Rajah Camp further inside. Furthermore, 191 is a NAC service. What other buses do you expect SBST to put on this service?</div>

It would be better if 12m buses could facilitate the bendies.</div>

So they have no other alternative but to utilize Mk IIs. However, don't forget Sv. 151 also has quite a number of a/c buses.</div>

So if you dont like to take NAC Mk2, There's still a VO 3x or a Merz on 154 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
