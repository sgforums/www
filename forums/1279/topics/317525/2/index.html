              <p>That was what the government decided last time. Public for masses, private as luxury. During the economic boom in the mid 1990s, one COE can cost up to $100,000. But when the bidding system was changed to an open system, the COE dropped drastically by almost 10 folds to $10,000 or sometimes even below.</p>

              <p><br>Not possible. Double stops are mostly found along city areas whereby traffic volume is extremely high. To have another lane for buses, it would bring traffic jams if all cars abide to the bus lane rules, that is. Do note that most roads along CBD area are 3-4 lanes on average, if 2 lanes are given for buses, that only leaves 1-2 lanes for cars and other private vehicles. Massive jams would occur.</p>

              <p>I certainly hope that I am over-sensitive. But those who have responded to my posts seems to take things very personal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personal transports are able to offer the mobility which public transport can never give. Drive to the Mcdonald's 2km away with sweatless effort at 2am on a Sunday Morning. Appear in the Changi Warehouse at 9am and spend the next 2 hours checking the products and having company lunch with your boss at 12pm at Raffles Marina. Driving/riding up to Malacca on a Saturday in less than 3 hours from the time you leave your house. Have lunch over there and shop around before coming back home before sun down. Not forgetting to enjoy the drive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indeed, personal transports are always tagged along with 'luxury'. Considering the costs involved, in Singapore, personal transports are not meant for everybody. (but not true for small motorcycles. I calculated before that small motorcycles spend lesser than public transport if you span them over a 10 year period. And do not forget the greatly enhanced mobility you will have.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Statistics have shown that the approximate car to people population in Singapore is 1:9 while Germany is 1:3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Instead of giving yourself only the choice of public transports, why don't you render yourself capable of making choices. You can opt to drive today or when you don't feel like it, you can take a bus. Because you become financially capable and owns the necessary licence to own a personal transport.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>About affecting the road congestion, you should take note that the current public transport stronghold is already struggling to meet the demands of the public. You wouldn't want 50% of personal transport owners to join in the squeeze with you during peak periods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try asking those who're operating on personal transports as all started off with public transport. Given the opportunity again, will they physically forsake their personal transports for public transports</p>
              <p>again. Even with increasing operating costs of personal transports, the stats shown from onemotoring only shows an increase in personal transport rather than decline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please take my posts with respect as I am merely stating a point of view missed out by most people. There's no intention to humiliate anyone no matter what. I respect bus fans as much as I hope bus fans will reciprocate the goodwill gesture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p><br>So you are playing boss here?My foot.So what if other people also say so? Are u creating an arguement ground here? I dun think there are any flaming required. What MS said is quite true, I had been taking public transport since young. You would find it frustrated when buses are frequently late or overcrowded but nothing are done or improvement is minimum. This is similar to train. I do understand that congestion during the peak hour are getting worst. I do not drive during the peak hours.  I own a red plate car now, so I dun think it would really cause great congestion.</p>
