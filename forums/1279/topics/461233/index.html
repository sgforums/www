              <p>1. A fleet that is 3 times as small, but produced a loss of nearly 6 times in absolute terms more implies a staggering loss that is 18 times more per bus compared to SBST.</p>
              <p>Clearly it is not just demand factors that have reduced the profit margin. Cost of running a single bus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MUST BE</span> more than SBST.</p>
              <p>Fully understandable from the POV of scale economics. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>2. So as svc_238 rightly points out, demand in SMRT region isn't as high across the board.</p>
              <p>I shall take this chance to suan the other people who constantly talked about "packed bendies". They aren't wrong in the little regions they live in. But it is exceedly clear that the cross-subsidisation effect for these pockets of services weren't enough to cover for the bleeding services.</p>
              <p>The implicit suggestion in svc_238's argument is for SMRT to reach into areas of higher demand.</p>
              <p>Now......</p>
              <p>You tell me how to do that with bendies?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Essentially a number of fan-boys here are amazing short-sighted obviously.</p>
              <p>Again.</p>
              <p>SMRT needs to do something about its fleet now.</p>
              <p>SMRT knows it too.</p>
              <p>But they haven't done it.</p>
              <p>Not when their trains and shops make money to cover these losses.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ok back then i used to attend SMRTB meetings help either @ Lor 3,Various Interchanges/Terminals or depot itself.First of all the mediocre managing of buses which used to cause a stir among myself the Union and management.The points i have addressed is straightforward,Firstly Ang Mo Kio Depot.SMRTB spends ten thousands of dollars each month just to overnight parking for their buses namely,Bukit Batok,Choa Chu Kang,Woodlands,Sembawang and Yishun and recently Bukit Panjang.I point out in order to meet passengers demand SMRTB should expand or move into a bigger depot and strategic locations..No need to follow SBST style but just get it almost there.All this goes to deaf ears.From the day i'm employed there till now the plan to lease the empty plot of land opp the depot remains unclear citing cost.This is what happen when they dun think clearly ahead of what lies in future which SBST just do it right.I suggest that Taxis and Bus Plus park at dedicated bus park which can suit them most but again fell into deaf ears..Second issue about overworking and maintenance negligance to the buses itself,For SBST when a bus is schedule for Preventive maintenance theres a note at the S-Shift driver waybill but SMRT style the tech will look for you during night refuelling and coinbox dismantle,But again if the tech are busy the buses just skip for another day,Imagine what could happen?This is what happen when SMRT took over.</p></div>

              <p>I have given up writing to LTA and SMRT on the problems with their services like 190 and 960. No point.. Hopeless company, and unless the top changes hopefully lead by the Ex General, i foresee no improvement in their bus biz, screw up all times high!</p>
              <p>One more thing, articulated buses joint there, the rubber which connect the two buses stinks and looks like they can't be bothered.</p>

              <p>Are you talking about the new CEO as in the newly-appointed one for the entire SMRT or just the bus services division? If it's the entire SMRT overall-in-charge, I guess you can forget it. It's almost 100% that his focus would be on the train services 1st before settling the buses, and look the problems with the trains still persist. The previous Ms Saw took the same approach and I see it likely that he'll continue this trend.</p>
              <p>SMRT bus division is just like a burden weighing them down on the whole. They profit from the trains, but yet they have to cross-subsidise to cover the losses on the buses. And then the whole company goes into disarray because of this cause in turn they have to cut costs here &amp; there, both on trains &amp; buses to make the profits for shareholders. And even then, obviously it didn't work in reducing the losses. It seems more and more like they're keeping the buses only as a matter of pride, cause obviously they don't give much shit about it + the cash-cows aren't exactly turning everything under buses profitable on the whole.</p>
              <p>I know it's abit off-topic, but anyone read the news lately that SMRT &amp; LTA are only going to finally waterproof the Circle Line cables to prevent future faults? That was stupid. That problem with leaking water seeping into the cables &amp; short-circuit the cables <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">existed for years</span></strong> since the Circle Line started~ It's just the insiders &amp; workers who had to keep mum &amp; force themselves to keep using stop-gap measures here &amp; there for the cables. And that was only for the trains with their cost-cutting. Like what 'carbikebus' posted, similar things happened in buses too &amp; its plain obvious something needs to be done with the entire top management of the company, not just from either bus or train divisions.~Â </p>
