              <p>I have checked on the net before I boarded the bus. Street Directory says take bus 132 from bus stop nearby Far East Plaza, but I did not know whether it is the bus stop directly in front of Far East Plaza or opposite Far East Plaza.</p>

              <p><br>i guess you wouldnt go wrong if you only said RGS.<br><br>maybe you said too many building names(others which may be unheard of to him) then he also confused then he also must close the exit door. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>excuse me, did i ever say I wanted them to be my tour guide? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I am not exactly asking him how to go to the place. I am asking him if the bus he is driving will bring me to that place. Since he is not very sure, I provided him with the names of the buildings nearby to help him. But he still failed to recall that his bus doesn't go there.</p>

              <p>The bus captain knows his route, and if he is to cover a different route, he will know that route too. His knowledge is linear, and he knows the road well. As for buildings he will know only those prominent government buildings by name, all others he will know by sight. Show him a picture of a building along his route and he will know where it is. Give him the building's name, and ???.</p>
              <p>Maps? A map is a plan of the area, and a person occupied with driving a bus has not the time to examine it, get the orientation, and fix the location on it. No one looks at a map, even a simple one, or a few seconds.</p>
              <p>The bus captain is not at fault, even if he blundered, because his priority is to get on the way, and helping TS was unavoidably slipshod. And TS was a distraction to his driving too. I think in Europe there are buses with signs prohibiting talking to the drivers. </p>

              <p>yes ur a re right. it is LAW in hong kong and Europe not to talk with bus captain whilst driving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in hong kong bus there is even this yellow line drawn so that u stand behind it n dun get tok to drvier. its drawn slanted from first seat toward where we place ourvalidators. (think single deck). <br><br>from whhat i observe, once the line is reached for standing pax, no more pax will be allowed to board the hong kong bus. pax wd be rejected altho stiill got space. rationale is good. as drvier needs to be ale to view the mirror on the left to see left nearside n blind spot. if not moving off may hit peple on his left. plus the mirror double up as watching ppl run after the bus to cacth ur bus as u wait at bus stop.</p>
              <p>u will notice for us we stand until door (ie celebrate life)  sumtimes driver will ask u to move a bit so he can access to his mirror left blind spot  view.</p>

              <p>no. 1: You had a map<br>no. 2: You knew where you were<br>no. 3: You should be able to tell that its the opposite direction<br>no. 4: The driver is confused by you telling him all those extra unnecessary info</p>
              <p>You can't really blame the driver. He knows that it passes, but doesnt know when. Of course, if you asked the driver of a 124 and he tells you to just get on and that the bus goes to Orange Grove Road, you can blame him.</p>
