            <div class='col-md body'>but would it take longer to strip the full-advertisement and re-paint it back to SBST and Tibs design??<br><br>I've seen somewhere from a TV programme many years back, the painting of a Tibs Merc O405bus, and looked tedious. A Spray painter had to mark out the positions and cover up each layer of different colour before doing the spray painting bit by bit. Even the frames of the doors have to be painted on.<br><br>But I find that the paintwork finish of Tibs buses are far better than SBST buses, prob coz they are spray painted.
