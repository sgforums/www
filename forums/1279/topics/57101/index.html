Maybe the triangular bus stopping sign used in the Lance 211s and Volgren 0405s are the worse of the lot, its blinking and so damn small. Esp they go " EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" whenever they press the bell.....luckily it can only be pressed once. This never fails to wake at least 50% of the sleeping pax.<br><br>Or some of the Hispano 0405 with a very slow and faulty door closes with a hypnotic " Ding dong x 100? " that's faulty door with a working bell.</div>
