            <div class='col-md body'>Wednesday April 28, 10:17 PM<br><strong>SMRT reviewing fares after no hikes for two years</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE: Rail operator SMRT says it is reviewing fares to cover higher costs and declining revenues.<br><br>It posted a 24 per cent jump in full-year earnings and its fourth quarter earnings trebled, but that's thanks largely to tax writebacks.<br><br>Any move to raise fares might prove controversial as unemployment in Singapore is still high.<br><br>SMRT also says it'll expand its taxi fleet to generate more sales.<br><br>Listed transport firms ComfortDelgro and SBS Transit have both assured commuters they won't raise fares.<br><br>But rival SMRT says it has not hiked fares for two years and that any increase will be prudent.<br><br>Any fare increase will need to be approved by the Public Transport Council (PTC).<br><br>Said SMRT president Saw Phaik Hwa: "We review our fares every year and we are still in the process of doing that. There's more than one reason. Fare increases are always justified on a basket of reasons. So it will be up to PTC to review the matter. Security is something up in the air but at this stage, it's difficult to comment."<br><br>That's because a high-level committee which is looking at ways to make the public transport system more secure, is expected to reach a decision only in a few months' time.<br><br>SMRT's latest profit may sound good but its revenue actually fell, hit by competition from the North East Line (NEL), SARS outbreak and the absorption of the increase in the Goods and Services Tax.<br><br><strong>Besides reviewing MRT fares</strong>, the SMRT is also looking for new ways to boost sales, like adding 1,000 more taxis to its current fleet of 2,000 over the next 12 months.<br><br>It may also tap the market later this year for more funds to finance capital spending.<br><br>And although there's no move to take over the NEL for now, SMRT says it is always keen to expand.<br><br>As for the impact of the recent Nicoll Highway collapse, SMRT says it's still too early to comment.<br><br>It adds that any delay to complete the Circle Line project isn't likely to have a significant impact on its earnings. - CNA<br>----------------------<br><br>The bolded part, saying MRT fares will be raised.Please clarify it..Will Tibs fares be increased too?</div>
