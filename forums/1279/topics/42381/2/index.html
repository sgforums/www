(BUBBLE - B10BLE)<br><br>i was like damn happy lor. we went up and found a seat and took it all the way to sengkang int.<br><br>after that we went to take 89 (SBS714) yucky mark 3 to pasir ris for dinner and the evening spotting.<br><br>7:38 finsih dinner. took our tiem to get to pasir ris int.<br><br>7:56pm. hmmm saw the rego on the TV was 2727 for 518. i felt a sign of trouble as we did not see any mark 4s doing 518 before the LUB bus (L94UB).<br>thne alter a mark 4 strider came in for 518. i noticed that it had strange painted front. the same one as we saw just now before 2888 so now we felt safe.<br><br>20:16pm. saw sbs68 appear on TV screen for 403. proceeded to wait for 403 at the 403 queue. but instead 3632 pulled up. aborted taking sbs68g. went back to TV screen then saw....2888 on 518. we were so happy. but we had to wait till 8:31pm.<br><br>8:33pm: 2888 pulled up. ebz took the fella to scotts. i went all the way to chinatown there to get a bus home.<br><br>on 2888 and 1688:<br>1688 the engine was very good . no muhc rattling for this bus. i liked the bus very much also.<br>2888 was remarkly diff from the mar29 spotting i ahd with it. the bus then was going so fast. today it was half dead...as dead as a mark 3. did not even push beyond 3rd gear all the time...very slooooooooooooooooooow<br>2888 today got engine troubles. some weird sound was coming out of it when we were at the traffic junctions . disrupting our "quiet scania feeling" for 2888. the bus also made a lot of splurting scania sounds...in fact too much.<br>2888 was also rattling like mad. however the floorboards were not the prob as FS mentioned. i think it was the railings and other fixtures.<br><br>ebz left me at 10pm. i continued to raffles hotel intending to get a scania L113 961 to go home.<br><br>unfortunaely i waited for 5 961s...all merc0405...damn pissed off. then suddenly the sbs34 oulled up on doing svc 32. i was so happy i gladly took the chance to start work on getting to sit all the 31--80 scanias OACs.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me, Hao Rui, Chris and Jack also went out, only on Sat 3 May.<br><br>Objectives:<br><br>1. Take SV 603(travels along narrow roads)<br>2. Go to Sentosa for 2 axle LO and OF1413<br>3. Take Sv. 91<br>4. Take photos of Bukit Batok services.<br><br>In the end we left Sv. 91 out, no time, we took Sv. 63 to Rumah Tinggi Terminal, very small the place is, only TWO lots for buses to park and that's about it. It's smaller than Ghim Moh!<br><br>I met Jack at 9am to take SBS 9816E(with my favourite lady driver who's an old-timer ex Sv. 5<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. 9816E left interchange at 9.30am and Jack praised her driving skills, which were superb.<br><br>Met Hao Rui when he boarded the bus at 10am, proceeded down to Park Mall to get CSS 603 bus. We got on CSS 278U(DAF, Hao Rui thought there would be Hinos) and went to St. Michaels. The terminal is rather tiny, if it rains you have no shelter(happened to us!)<br><br>Took Sv. 124 down to South Bridge Rd to change 80 to meet Chris as Harbourfront. Chris was holding two side desto plates, one for Sv. 93 old style with aircon text and different colours, and one Sv. 80 desto first version.<br><br>We went to Sentosa and found our OF1413s, however the LOs nowhere to be found, so we decided to vist the Transport Office and we found them there. We asked permission to take photos and we were allowed to do so.<br><br>Left Sentosa around 2pm and took Sv. 63 to Rumah Tinggi, the terminal is tiny, only two lots for buses to park and a little cul-de-sac, that's it!<br><br>Went to Alexandra for lunch, me and Jack left the two of them, who went to Bukit Batok to get photos.</div>

TIB837 (original front) came. so i gladly took the ELBO.<br>Oriignal plan was to spot some scania 32s but interesting enough i managed to get lost in chinatown. so i stayed on the bus till St geroge's area there (geyland lor 1 ter).<br><br>i finish the whole juoney under 1 hour. i was suprised at the speed and decided i shd just tkae 961 to the eastside next time if i felt like it.<br><br>2:34pm.<br>looks like i cd be late for the bedok meeting. saw this 158B come along. rego 3913 . nothin much was seen. i decided to wait for the VSO21 after a CAC scania (not one i wanted) service 2 came.<br><br>3pm<br>the VSO came. it was 9813. the bus was gutless and slow.<br><br>3:30pm . reach bedok reserivor rd. waited for 228 OAC scania. 20 mins no bus...grrrrr...then came a non air-con one...grrrrr....then another 20 mins went by.<br><br>finally a sbs77 &lt;87&gt; pulled up. i took it but the driver drove Soooooo slow i cd not really decide how the bus was. but it did not shake at all when stopped.<br><br>4:20pm. arrived at bedok. nothing much to be seen at bedok. met the gang (FS, charles, Jack). SBs999 did not turn up<br><br>chalres and FS decided to seperate from us as charles saw i had the scania face. (i really did actually)<br><br>jack followed me for 2888. but we had to get to pasir ris by 1730pm in order to get 2888. i thought this was going to be a tight one considering how choosy i am with buses.<br><br>i selected sbs70 &lt;228&gt; to take with jack to bedok reserv rd (again) and get back on another VSO21.<br><br>4:46pm.<br>we arrived at this bus stop with a great view of bedok rsvr. Service 21 turned up with VSO 9811. 9811 was nice and fast. jack and i thoroughly enjoyed the bus ride. along the way we saw 998.<br><br>5:23pm. arrived at pasir ris. saw no LUB. saw 2729 &lt;518&gt;. felt trouble as i recalled 2727 was before LUB the day before (it turned out i was wrong and the rego was to had been 2729 at any rate)<br><br>went over to the TV (again) and saw 2888 displayed under 518. we went to toilet (as usual for me) and jack went to top up EZ-link card.<br><br>17:32<br>we are now at 518 waiting area. jack got some great pics of 518 and the VSO we took just now. they were parked side by side (almost). saw sbs45 appear on TV screen doing &lt;12&gt;...sighz cannot get 45 today??????<br><br>17:40pm.<br>driver started late. but anyhow we got on SBS2888 (for me it was another ride in jsut 2 days). once the driver started the bus and moved. i knew this was going to be one good ride.<br><br>the bus was feeling much better today. no silly squeaking sound from the engine. but the bus still clearing air alot.<br><br>jack and i very enjoyed the ride althogh we were slowed by heavy traffic a bit. this time the driver did the bend at the moulmein rd exit real fast (shoik). he cd not do the flyover  fast climbing and going faster down like last time as got heavy traffic.<br><br>i think it was a male driver as mar 29.<br><br>i dropped at newton. (jack took 9888 later- read his post too)<br>went to woodlands by MRT. makan there.<br><br>7:39pm<br>finsih makan. went over to wdlands int. saw no VSo. then a VSo came in and it came out at 8pm. it was the 9844 &lt;161&gt;<br><br>8 till 9: i am on 9844. the bus driver in the mood tonight. sped very fast. probably hit 70km/h even.<br>halfway the bus did the most amazing thing which i thought would never happen!<br><br>the driver was gunning it (very loud) suddenly i heard a click sound and the engine went dead. the driver had put the bus into nuetral gear and let the bus glide on its sotred engine power (very very cool). but the dashboard went "eeeeeeeeeeeee" like the sound u hear on bendybus went over speed limit. the bus carried on at high speed with NO SOUND at all. like engine dead but BUS STILL MOVING<br><br>after 2 or 3 mins the engine spluttered to life and we were back to normal gunning mode.<br><br>9pm: felt very sian at "sengkang edge". then the 88 came . i reluctantly took 9637 &lt;88&gt; to pasir ris to try my luck.<br><br>a OAC scania did came into int after 15 mins of waiitng. jus tmy luck.... it turned out to be the sbs45 of svc 12 we saw just now.<br><br>i gladly took the bus to tanah merah. the driver was good with bus. went very fast and knew how to keep the bus in some gear mode that would not shake the bus when stopped at junctions.<br>i something like when the VSo stops and u hear some reving going on.<br><br>END<br><br>hope dun mind the long report...coz very long day lor<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This was my bus spotting with YX...<br><br>Objectives:<br>SBS 999 U (Off svc lah!)<br>SBS 2888 T (Very good! Boarded the bus!)<br>SBS 9888 Y (Not within my objectives, but prediction, it came!!!)<br><br>2.30 PM<br><br>Went to Toa Payoh to get something. Boarded SBS 2753Z, a Mk 4 DM 3500, with refurbished handles (not the yellow ones anymore, but the metallic ones. Repainted with SBST livery after removing Master's Milk Ad)<br><br>3.05 PM<br><br>Thought that I would be rushing if I took Svc 28 to Bedok, therefore I took a train down to Bedok.<br><br>3.35PM<br><br>Reached Bedok. Looked around the interchange. Suddenly, both Charles (The Airbus330) and Fang Sheng (Bendy Bus) appeared in front of me. Seemed be a great formation of transportation =P. Around 3.55PM, called up Yanxin. He was just in front of the display monitors. He didn't notice about it at all! Haha!<br><br>4.35 pm<br><br>Waiting Service 228. It was SBS 70. It shook rather violent and sounded rather bad! =P Perhaps it's ageing... (an old man Scania)<br><br>4.45 pm<br><br>Reached Bedok Reservoir Rd. Yanxin and I were talking over buses at the bus stop while waiting Svc 21. 9811T came! Goodie bus with goodie driver! This bus driver was manipulating the bus  fast and well!<br><br>5.30 pm<br><br>Reached Pasir Ris Interchange. Upon seeing SBS 2729 U, we thought that we might have to  wait SBS 2888 T for a longer period of time. However, to our surprise, the display showed this &gt;&gt; 518 17:37  SBS 2888 T    My mind was shouting, 'Hooray! I am going to board this LUB bus!' Both of us went to relieve oursleves, and I got to top out my EZ-Link Card.<br><br>5.40 pm<br><br>The bus seemed to pulled out late. I took a couple of shots of it. Quite ok. This bus was running great! I liked the way it sped along Bedok North! It took over Service 8 (SBS 3882C). Due to the curfew being 'imposed' by my mother, I had to get home by 8 pm. Therefore, I couldn't carry on with Yanxin to Woodlands to catch the VSO. Upon reaching Newton Circus, i bid farewell to Yanxin and I continued my journey to Orchard to transfer a bus service to my home.<br><br>6.30 pm<br><br>I reached at the bus stop o/s The Hereen. Felt hungry and bought a bread from BreadTalk (yummy Delicious!)to eat. I wanted to wait for a Trident, as a finale for my trip.<br><br>6.48 pm<br><br>Service 111's SBS 9678 L came. I saw it and I almost boarded it. Suddenly, I saw a double decker bus with a greenish yellow digital desto. My mind was shutting, 'SBS 9888Y! SONG! WHOOPIE!' In order not to miss my opportunity, I boarded the bus! This fella was rather smooth than the newer batch of VSO! It has ZF 4HP500 Gearbox! Jia Song! (In hokkein means feeling super ultra comfortable) Hummed along the engine sound... This bus accelerated very fast and it could kick off to the 4th gear, unlike those newer batch of VSO, whereby they are yearning to change to another gear. At 7.12 pm, I bid farewell to SBS 9888Y and walked home.<br><br>In conclusion, 6th May is the most memorable day I would ever forget! Boarding both 2888T and 9888Y are very SONG!<br><br>Jack</div>

The bus captain didn't turn on the ventilation fans.

But later in Tampines Interchange, managed to catch 998Y ( svc 18 ) at 6.30 pm, enjoying the air-con to Bedok.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today's Tridents Day is considered as 50-50. Actually, we were aiming Tridents for Svc 85, 64, and 111. However, we only caught Svc 85 and 64. Today's spotting is shown as follow:<br><br>2.35 pm: Reached Sengkang. Saw Christopher and Ben in the interchange. Saw TIB 1208U, as chartered bus of CHC. Then, we saw 9888Y turning into the interchange to let the passengers to alight. Chris and I took a few shots of 9888Y. Then, YX and Ebenezer came. They boarded Svc 965, TIB 940 U (EEEEEEE! Lance 245 on Svc 965!!!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> As ben had never boarded SBS 9888Y b4, all of us boarded SBS 9888 Y. It wasn't Express 502, but Express 502A.<br><br>4.10 pm: We reached Somerset Road. Then we transfer to Svc 85 Trident, SBS 9675U. We boarded it all the way to Tiong Bahru Road. Next, we transferred to Svc 33 (a Mark 4 Strider, forgot rego) to Dawson Place, Alexandra Road. We boarded SBS 9687K, Svc 64 Trident. We alighted at PS (Plaza Singapura) to have our dinner.<br><br>7.20 pm: Waited for Trident like siao! None appeared! Ben left first to Toa Payoh. Then Ebenezer left for home. At around 8.30 pm, we aborted the plan and went home. I boarded TIB1085U, Svc 106. It was doing cameo today. This was actully a Svc 176 bus. Got a few svc guide from it. Towards the end of my journey, i saw SVC 107 WITH LO 2 AXLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so shocked to see this! I hardly believe what I had seen.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE  END~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>
