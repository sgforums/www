            <div class='col-md body'>Bus companies shall submit their proposal for bus fare adjustment soon to PTC. And PTC probably shall announce their decision in May 2004.<br><br>Many fare increases have caught Singaporeans off guard. The recent increases in Newspaper, even the curry puffs from Old Chang Kee had increased from 90 cents to $1.<br><br>I had feeling that PTC will allow bus/train fare adjustments this year. Remember someone had said about NEL fare, perhaps we should increase SMRT fare to be on par with NEL.......<br><br>Do you think the bus companies had done enough to contain their costs? Do you think we should provide 100% accessibility to disabled? Do you think the provision of such facilities (including lift) may be an excuse to increase bus fares this year. Do you think a change in captain uniforms (by TIBS) will enhance your journey?<br><br>At this critical time, any suggestion to TIBS and SBST to increase their train or bus services, shall give them the excuse to increase train/bus fares. Any suggestion for an enhance GPS, VLS systems shall give them a reason to increase fares too.<br><br>Shall we ask PTC not to push the bus companies into implementing the VLS systems? Shall we ask PTC not to push the bus companies into giving commuters us the 24hours phone bus guide services? Who on earth need all these things?<br><br>If we prepare our bullets early, PTC will think hard prior submiting to bus companies requests. Remembers not many members in PTC take buses!!! We commuters might know better what are more important to us, price or service.<br><br>So please tell everyone why the bus companies should not be given a fare adjustment this year.<br></div>

That it is one of the service checklist that bus companies must met.<br><br>Remember TIBS had one time implement on certain routes (like TIBS 61) on introducing major attractions along its route. A giant board that introduces those major attractions. I would not give a damn if TIBS had decided to scrape that service improvement.<br></div>
