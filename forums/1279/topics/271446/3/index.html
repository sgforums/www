            <div class='col-md body'>SMRT dont really deserve to ask for increase loh. Apart from introducing shorthaul services over the past yr, extending the operating hours for 806 and 964, amending 966 into bt panjang, introducing Premium 530 and 531, E services like 188E and 854E, there is almost no more significant improvements done.<br><br>Although SBST still have alot to improve on frequencies of certain services too, they have introduced new services like 5 and 175, Premium 532 - 545, Niteowl 1N to 8N, introducing many new bus stops around the island, B9TLs, Promotions and later last buses(Incl late night shopping) and hence it is more justifiable for SBST to increase fare, since large sums of money has to be placed for purchasing the 300 WAB Buses so far.</div>

Questions: Is our govt really care for their people? I think no.<br><br>To be a good leader of a country, one shall never tax heavily on their citizens. if the govt are really good to their people, they dun even have to worry when election come and dun have to waste money buying votes.</div>
