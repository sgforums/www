              <p>THE TRUTH ON SPT KIDS FROM BIS</p>
              <p>Some fans had been asking me what's the "boycott" thing they
              heard. Though I had explained to them and they understood - (and
              was surprised by what actually took place)...guess it's better to
              post this here and clear it up.</p>
              <p>Basically...was boycotted because I voiced a different opinion
              on how to photograph buses. I was told/taught by the group ppl to
              photograph at a standard angle where it's showing 90% side X 10%
              front which according to one guy "was the only nice angle" after
              they tried a lot of other angles which to them turned out to be
              "ugly". Along with that, cannot be "pokked" (partly blocked) by
              cars or shadows even by a little bit, cannot have opposing sunlight
              direction that causes shadows that darken the subject or the front
              of the bus and make it look not nice.</p>
              <p>Found that those advices were troublesome to follow, and was
              binding me in a box especially the restriction to one 90% side X
              10% head angle for every shot. Tried to photograph at other angles,
              but instead got criticised as "head (front of bus) too big", "ugly"
              "too dark" and "fail shots". Nothing wrong with their standard
              angles, but after photographing that same angle repeatedly, some
              would get bored too after viewing the same angle shots repeatedly
              though of different buses, and continually viewing an album with
              the buses photographed at the same angle over and over...you get
              the point.</p>
              <p>Besides, there's infinite opportunities to capture a shot at any
              angle and stuffs. Tried to talk to them about it, that there's more
              than just sticking to the standard template and those "rules", and
              that photography should be more flexible....not forcing others to
              follow what the majority views as best practices. But they saw me
              as "not wanting to follow their advices" and so, I left the chat in
              frustration and some kid initiated a boycott, hoping that the
              boycott will make me rethink my views and not "losing them as
              friends". Didn't look back since then.</p>
              <p>Yeah it's *that* lame. But I've been photographing more freely
              since then without the need to be chained down by some rules every
              since that day. Sure, some shots posted here isn't really that top
              notch quality, but it's more flexible to capture a shot at least.
              Since this year I had also seen overseas bus pages posting photos
              that would have technically contradicted that group's "high
              quality" standard, but it was a guarantee that I was on the right
              track - It may not be a perfect or high quality shot, 20 years
              later it might hold more clues for others in the future to see this
              snapshot of our transport history....</p>

              <p>Same reply like the guy whom push down elderly off the bus-you can never really trust one sided story. Even if it's the truth, it can be avoided~ There's no point making a fuss over it. </p>

              <p>Since SGWiki updated the A24 to 18.75m, I decided to do a
              detailed comparison of the Lion's City G and GL.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Lion's City G (17,980mm)
              config</span></p>

              <p>Lion's City GL <span style="line-height: 1.231;">(18,750mm) </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">config</span></p>

              <p>Note that Lion's City GL has no rear wheelchair slot, like
              SMB388S. And there is not much difference in length.</p>
              <p>MAN Lion's City G (5 windows for the front part of the bus,
              including 1 small window):</p>

              <p>Conclusion: A24 could be 18.75m long, <strong>OR</strong> it
              could be a 18m chassis with a modified GL configuration (Note that
              the 5 windows are not equally sized, seems like Gemilang made it
              look like the GL by having no small window, as for the trailer it
              doesn't have the 2nd wheelchair slot, which is also part of the
              GL's original configuration).</p>
              <p>The difference in length only applies to the front part of the
              bus as both G and GL have the same trailer length.</p>
              <p>What do you all think?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>There is no G or GL in 388S, the G and GL indicators are only used on the integral Lion's City from MAN with model code A23. The designation by MAN of A24 shows that it is a chassis form of the A23.<br><br>Since 388S is also not a integral unit from MAN, but instead built by Gemilang with the design of MAN Lion's City series, we cannot compare the seating configuration or the installation of the glass panels directly. That would be comparing apple to oranges.<br><br>Also note that the design by Gemilang has shifted the exit doors of the rear section forward by 1 seat, unlike the design from MAN.</p>

              A month ago, SMB388S was introduced into service on 190 - replacing TIB838H (the first demonstrator bendy bus) which has been retired and scrapped. 
              <p>
              There's still a long road ahead for this bendy bus, and it is likely we may be seeing its production batch vehicles in the future replacing the TIBS Mercedes Benz O405G feet given the NL323F's success.</p><p>

              <p><br> A month ago, SMB388S was introduced into service on 190 - replacing
              TIB838H (the first demonstrator bendy bus) which has been retired
              and scrapped.</p>
              <p>There's still a long road ahead for this bendy bus, and it is
              likely we may be seeing its production batch vehicles in the future
              replacing the TIBS Mercedes Benz O405G feet given the NL323F's

              <p>There is no G or GL in 388S, the G and GL indicators are only used on the integral Lion's City from MAN with model code A23. The designation by MAN of A24 shows that it is a chassis form of the A23.<br><br>Since 388S is also not a integral unit from MAN, but instead built by Gemilang with the design of MAN Lion's City series, we cannot compare the seating configuration or the installation of the glass panels directly.
