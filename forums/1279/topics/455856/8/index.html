              Terminating Point R, Institution S</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A <strong>(31)</strong> has a

              service that used to have 2 shortworking varients
              <strong>(158A/158B)</strong>. It intersects A <strong>(31)</strong> near an MRT station <strong>(Kallang)</strong> that is different
              from the previous paragraph.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">D operates Holiday1 twice a year. It
              passes by Institution Q and passes by A’s terminating point. It
              does not intersect B at all but one of its terminating point,
              R, is within 600m from 2 of B's bus stops.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">E is a pan-island service. It serves
              Institution Q and goes past a place where you can find a Xin Wang
              Hong Kong Café. It shares the same terminating point with two of
              the other unknown services A-O.</span></p>

              polyclinics <strong>(AMK and Sengkang)</strong>. It used to loop at

              situated at. It shares a terminating point <strong>(Toa
              Payoh)</strong> with A <strong>(31)</strong>.</span></p>

              does not have supplementary buses in 2004. Currently, it has 4
              supplementary buses serving 3 supplementary routes from both
              terminating points, making it the only service in Singapore to have
              buses leaving its parent service within a short period of time at
              both terminating points.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I <strong>(81)</strong> is a service
              used to have a supplementary bus that served a route
              <strong>(70) </strong>that is not under its controlling depot.
              It was removed when a certain service <strong>(577)</strong> was
              introduced. (You are not required to answer which service this is)
              Currently, it has 2 supplementary buses <strong>(9801
              9843)</strong> serving 2 different routes <strong>(552
              553)</strong>, both from its sole terminating point
              <strong>(Tampines)</strong>. One of its supplementary services
              intersects A <strong>(31)</strong> near I's <strong>(81)</strong> terminating point <strong>(Tampines)</strong>.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">J <strong>(3)</strong> has a P shift

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">K used to adopt a jump bus system
              but was removed in 2009. It has since added split shift buses and
              its an all-single deck service. It loops at a point with
              B.</span></p>

              Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have
              2 different supplementary buses to 1 supplementary service, at
              different times of the day. The supplementary service suffered a
              reduction in frequency after the supplementary buses were
              removed.</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">M used to have a supplementary bus
              from another service on its SWT. It was removed when M’s schedule
              had a revamp. Due to this revamp, another supplementary bus that
              used to serve M was removed as well. Its SWT route was amended
              twice ever since it was extended to terminate at this place. It
              shares the same terminating point as G</span></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">N <strong>(8)</strong> operates
              Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have
              supplementary buses from O <strong>(10)</strong> before 2004.
              Thereafter, these supplementary buses were removed when O’s
              <strong>(10)</strong> variant service <strong>(FFW10e)</strong> was
              introduced. It currently has one supplementary bus to a Premium
              Service <strong>(544)</strong>.</span></p>

              real pan-island long route but one of its terminating points was
              amended twice to its current one <strong>(Kent Ridge)</strong>. It
              has a variant service <strong>(FFw10e)</strong> and used to do
              supplementary trips on N <strong>(8)</strong>. Coincidentally, one
              of its terminating points <strong>(Tampines)</strong> is shared
              with 3 other services here <strong>(31 81 3)</strong>.</span></p>

                  passes by Institution Q and passes by A’s terminating point. It
                  does not intersect B at all but one of its terminating point,
                  R, is within 600m from 2 of B's bus stops.</span></p>

                  from another service on its SWT. It was removed when M’s schedule
                  had a revamp. Due to this revamp, another supplementary bus that
                  used to serve M was removed as well. Its SWT route was amended
                  twice ever since it was extended to terminate at this place. It
                  shares the same terminating point as G</span></p>

              <p>Wa if B is Sv22 then I think the question is very ambiguous. Taken at face value I'd think both services loop at the same point and thus my guesses. Sv22 didn't come into mind because it doesn't really loop (go back to its sole terminating point). The other kind of 'looping' that comes to mind is the double loop likes of 155/60.. But your answers are very reasonable and well thought-out. </p>

              <p>B is not 22 because it only meets A (31) at Tampines Int. What i'm looking for is bus stop that is next to the MRT station. In addition, B is not the first batch of services to get overnight parking in AMK.</p>
              <p>D is 105</p>
              <p>K is not 82 as 82 currently practices jumpbus. it supplements 84 but 84 does not have a SWT. Even if its asked in 2009 (the year i set the question), 11 does not have SWT also. It would not be coherent with B's answer if K is 82.</p>
              <p>F is 97 - good logic there using holiday1 schedule as well as speed cameras and varient services. </p>
              <p>E is 14 - it passes by the Marina Square (this one dont count also can), Cineleisure and East Coast Xin Wang HK Cafe.</p>
              <p>H is 165 - at the time i set, it was 4 buses supp out from Clementi, 1x 533, 1x 557 and 2x 285. Now its 3 buses from clementi, 1 bus from Hougang, 1x 557, 2x 285, 1x 534. The question was modified to suit the current state. However, it is still true that all 4 buses leave the parent service between 0725-0800hrs.</p>

              <p>B is not 22 because it only meets A (31) at Tampines Int. What
              i'm looking for is bus stop that is next to the MRT station. In
              addition, B is not the first batch of services to get overnight
              parking in AMK.</p>
              <p>D is 105</p>
              <p>K is not 82 as 82 currently practices jumpbus. it supplements 84
              but 84 does not have a SWT. Even if its asked in 2009 (the year i
              set the question), 11 does not have SWT also. It would not be
              coherent with B's answer if K is 82.</p>
              <p>F is 97 - good logic there using holiday1 schedule as well as
              speed cameras and varient services. </p>
              <p>E is 14 - it passes by the Marina Square (this one dont count
              also can), Cineleisure and East Coast Xin Wang HK Cafe.</p>
              <p>H is 165 - at the time i set, it was 4 buses supp out from
              Clementi, 1x 533, 1x 557 and 2x 285. Now its 3 buses from clementi,
              1 bus from Hougang, 1x 557, 2x 285, 1x 534. The question was
              modified to suit the current state. However, it is still true that
              all 4 buses leave the parent service between 0725-0800hrs.</p>
              <p>B is correct - 24<br> D is correct - 105<br> E is correct - 14<br> H is not 74<br> K is correct - 27<br> L is either 15 or 69, please choose one.<br> M is correct - 156<br> Q is correct - SP<br> S is correct - TP</p>
