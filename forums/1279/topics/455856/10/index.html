              <p>voith can go fast actually despite the poor acceleration from 1st to 3rd gear, and the only nice voiths belong to the citaros and dm3500s. and don't forget the weg2's voith(although wrights r slow). damn nice when speeding.</p>

              <p>SMRT should be the same as speed limiters are set by LTA.<br>I agree, speed limit should be 70km/h. 88's LO3x seems to be slower than what TIB1218R said... Or perhaps it is just the wrong BC I took. PRC drivers usually chiong one.</p>
