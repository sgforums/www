              <p>Sv 16 is none of the services mentioned. </p>
              <p>give you a few hints:</p>
              <p>1. F has a varient service<br>2. P &amp; Q are post-secondary/tert institutions<br>3. C's shortworking varient(s) serve a school and a private estate<br>4. H is mentioned in the forum thread - Optimal Usage of Double Deckers<br>5. The Premium Service mentioned in N serves an estate in the east.<br>6. O is a historical route. That's why it got cut twice. There are not many pan-island services that got cut twice on one end of its route within the last 25 years.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I created this quiz in early 2009. I think I didnt manage to post it here back then.. Here goes:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are given 15 different SBS Transit basic bus services: A – O, Institutions P and Q, Terminating Point R, Institution S</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">A has a Special1 schedule which will operate when Institution P is on holiday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">B has added 3 buses to its overnight parking terminating point since January 2009. Both A and B meet at this MRT Station and does not meet each other anywhere near thereafter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">C is a service that used to have 2 shortworking varients. It intersects A near an MRT station that is different from the previous paragraph.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">D operates Holiday1 twice a year. It passes by Institution Q and passes by A’s terminating point. It does not intersect B at all but one of its terminating point, R, is within 600m from 2 of B's bus stops.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">E is a pan-island service. It serves Institution Q and goes past a place where you can find a Xin Wang Hong Kong Café. It shares the same terminating point with two of the other unknown services A-O.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">F went past four Carl’s Junior Outlets. Two of which had since closed down. It passes by a place where there’s a speed camera. It has a Holiday1 schedule created in late May 2012.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">G goes to two polyclinics. It used to loop at the estate that one polyclinic is situated at. It shares a terminating point with A.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">H is a service that once upon a time does not have supplementary buses in 2004. Currently, it has 4 supplementary buses serving 3 supplementary routes from both terminating points, making it the only service in Singapore to have buses leaving its parent service within a short period of time at both terminating points.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">I is a service used to have a supplementary bus that served a route that is not under its controlling depot. It was removed when a certain service was introduced. (You are not required to answer which service this is) Currently, it has 2 supplementary buses serving 2 different routes, both from its sole terminating point. One of its supplementary services intersects A near I's terminating point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">J has a P shift that operates at least four trips of a SWT after the evening peak. It currently has one supplementary buses that does another service during AM Peak. It shares one of its terminating points with A and I.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">K used to adopt a jump bus system but was removed in 2009. It has since added split shift buses and its an all-single deck service. It loops at a point with B.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">L is a service that operates Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have 2 different supplementary buses to 1 supplementary service, at different times of the day. The supplementary service suffered a reduction in frequency after the supplementary buses were removed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">M used to have a supplementary bus from another service on its SWT. It was removed when M’s schedule had a revamp. Due to this revamp, another supplementary bus that used to serve M was removed as well. Its SWT route was amended twice ever since it was extended to terminate at this place. It shares the same terminating point as G</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">N operates Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have supplementary buses from O before 2004. Thereafter, these supplementary buses were removed when O’s variant service was introduced. It currently has one supplementary bus to a Premium Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">O used to be a real pan-island long route but one of its terminating points was amended twice to its current one. It has a variant service and used to do supplementary trips on N. Coincidentally, one of its terminating points is shared with 3 other services here.</span></p>

              After 3 stops C and E splits. C will meet D somewhere and splits
              before D will meet E for a few stops before splitting and meeting C
              for a few stops before splitting and then meeting again for the last

              <p>A: 31<br>C: 158<br><br>When you said they intersect at a MRT station, do you mean they run parallel for a few stops or just cross each other at a stop? Because if it's the former definition then these 2 answers are plausible. And with that institution P would be ITE college east while 158 serves Tg Rhu &amp; Dunman High. </p>
              <p>These were the services that came to me after thinking through for a while.. may be wrong again. <br><br>and some other slightly thought through guesses:<br><br>D: 151 (passes by Jln Tpy, serves NUS/NP)<br>G: 159 (polyclinics being AMK and SKG, used to loop at SKG)<br>I: 81 (not too sure abt the defunct crossover, but suppl sv would be 553 that meets 31 at Tamp Ave 5 stop)<br>J: 3 (a random guess which seems likely at least to me)</p>

              <p>A: 31<br> C: 158<br> <br> When you said they intersect at a MRT station, do you mean they run
              parallel for a few stops or just cross each other at a stop?
              Because if it's the former definition then these 2 answers are
              plausible. And with that institution P would be ITE college east
              while 158 serves Tg Rhu &amp; Dunman High. </p>
              <p>These were the services that came to me after thinking through

              <p>A is correct -<strong> 31</strong><br>C is also correct - <strong>158</strong><br><br>P is correct <strong>- ITE College East</strong></p>
              <p>D is not 151. Sv 151 is none of the 15 services I'm looking for. <br>G is correct - <strong>159.</strong></p>
              <p>I is<strong> 81 </strong>- the defunct crossover is sv 70. SBS2621X used to cross 70 from YCK to Shenton Way during AM Peak, then readjusted to serve 3 downroute trips from Gulliemard Rd to Shenton Way. Its Premium Service 553 intersects 31 at Tampines Ave 5.</p>
              <p>J is<strong> 3</strong> - If you get A &amp; I correct, its not hard to guess J because its the only shortworking trip that runs consistently post-PM Peak till late at night. The supp service during AM Peak mentioned is 37.</p>
              <p>Express and FFw services are included but they do not form the basic 15 services I'm looking for.</p>

              <p>N is<strong> 8</strong> - Institution S should be quite obvious already. <br>O is <strong>10</strong> - Used to cut from Jurong to Clementi and finally Kent Ridge. The varient service si FFw10e. It shares a terminating point with A (31), I (81) and J (3).</p>
              <p>2 Sv 10 buses used to serve Sv 8 during AM Peak. It was removed due to the introduction of FFw10e. It was also the time when CityShopper 579 was introduced so the supp trips were subsequently taken over by them for AM Peak. However, sv 8 had fleet addition eventually and all crossovers were removed and remained till recently when 9510L was called to supp P544.</p>
