              <p>I created this quiz in early 2009. I think I didnt manage to post it here back then.. Here goes:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are given 15 different SBS Transit basic
                  bus services: A – O, Institutions P and Q, Terminating Point R, Institution S</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">A has a Special1 schedule which will operate when
                  Institution P is on
                  holiday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">B has added 3 buses to its overnight parking
                  terminating point since
                  January 2009. Both A and B meet at this MRT Station and does not meet
                  each other anywhere near thereafter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">C is a service that used to have 2 shortworking varients. It intersects A near an MRT station that is different from the previous paragraph.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">D operates Holiday1 twice a year. It passes by Institution Q and passes by A’s terminating point. It does not intersect B at all but one of its terminating point, R, is within 600m from 2 of B's bus stops.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">E is a pan-island service. It serves Institution Q and goes past a place where you
                  can find a Xin Wang Hong Kong Café. It shares the same terminating point with two of the other
                  unknown services A-O.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">F went past four Carl’s Junior Outlets. Two of
                  which had since closed down. It passes by a place where there’s a speed camera. It has a Holiday1 schedule created in late May 2012.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">G goes to two polyclinics.<strong> </strong>It used to loop at the estate that one
                  polyclinic is situated at. It shares a terminating point with A.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">H is a service that once upon a time does not have
                  supplementary buses in 2004. Currently, it has 4 supplementary buses serving 3
                  supplementary routes from both terminating points, making it the only
                  service in Singapore to have buses leaving its parent service within a short
                  period of time at both terminating points. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">I is a service used to have a supplementary bus that
                  served a route that is not under its controlling depot. It was removed when a
                  certain service was introduced. (You are not required to answer which service
                  this is) Currently, it has 2 supplementary buses serving 2 different routes, both from its sole terminating point. One of its supplementary services intersects A near I's terminating point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">J has a P shift that operates at least four trips of
                  a SWT after the evening peak.
                  It currently has one supplementary buses that does another service during AM Peak. It shares one of its
                  terminating points with A<strong> </strong>and I.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">K used to adopt a jump bus system but was removed in 2009. It has since added split shift buses and its an all-single deck service. It loops at a point with B.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">L is a service that operates Special1 schedule when
                  Institution S is on holiday. It
                  used to have 2 different supplementary buses to 1 supplementary service, at
                  different times of the day. The supplementary service suffered a reduction in frequency
                  after the supplementary buses were removed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">M used to have a supplementary bus from another
                  service on its SWT. It was removed when M’s schedule had a revamp. Due to this revamp, another supplementary bus that
                  used to serve M was removed as
                  well. Its SWT route was amended twice ever since it was extended to terminate
                  at this place. It shares the same terminating point as G</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">N operates Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have
                  supplementary buses from O before
                  2004. Thereafter, these supplementary buses were removed when O’s variant service was introduced. It currently has one supplementary bus to a Premium Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">O used to be a real pan-island long route but one of
                  its terminating points was amended twice to its current one. It has a variant
                  service and<strong> </strong>used to do supplementary trips on N. Coincidentally, one of its
                  terminating points is shared with 3 other services here.</span></p>

              place. It shares the same terminating point as G</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">N operates Special1 schedule
              when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have supplementary
              buses from O before 2004. Thereafter, these supplementary
              buses were removed when O’s variant service was introduced. It
              currently has one supplementary bus to a Premium
              Service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">O used to be a real pan-island
              long route but one of its terminating points was amended twice to
              its current one. It has a variant service and used to do
              supplementary trips on N. Coincidentally, one of its terminating
              points is shared with 3 other services here.</span></p>
