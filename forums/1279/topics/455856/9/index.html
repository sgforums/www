              <p>Is Svc A 27 and Svc B 34?</p>
              <p>Svc 27 start downroute a UOB Tampines Center bus stop and Svc 34
              starts downroute at Tampines Stadium.</p>
              <p>Svc 27's downroute buses will pass through Svc 34 route before
              turning left to Tampines Ave 4 to start service. As for Svc 34's
              downroute it will be the opposite and it will turn right into
              Tampines Ave 5 to start service.</p>

              <p>Yup. But I actually knew about the downroutes when I found out that the best way to take an empty svc 27 bus and svc 34 bus is to wait at these stops. Best if the downroute bus come after another bus, then it will be quite empty afterwards(excluding svc 27 sometimes).</p>
