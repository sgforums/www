              <p>Actually it is not that they do not want to make both 178 and 853 WAB but I do not think they would make them as priorities first.</p>
              <p>Look at the fleets now. Most probably if TIB438D of 178 and TIB426M of AM/YI 853 goes waiting for DR I do not think they will replace it with a new bus. Furthermore AM always seem reluctant to take in MANs which is why it is a no-go.</p>

              <p>The far worst one I've seen is from KJDEP. Their MAN always get
              shiny rims-yes, but their OCs, like 133K whom went over to KJDEP
              from WLDEP, damn cui. The headlights pop out, algaes forming, and
              even the new 388S's wing mirror cover removed.</p>

              <p>they only seem to polish certain MAN's rims, maybe its because they dont wash those ONP buses to save time... their maintenance for MAN already deproved alot...</p>
              <p>took SMB133K last week, interior dirtier compared to when it was in WLDEP. but very clean compared to AMDEP. see SMB75U, whole interior air-con pod is already green with algae, the angle corner at the side rear interior seats already very black with some brown thing there </p>

              <p>The funnier issue is just how much time people are EXPECTED to have according to some.</p>
              <p>Seriously if you have the time, go do something useful for everyone like working in LTA, do transport planning with a consultancy firm, or something. Or drive bus, or work at the depot (the source of some magical fascination wow).</p>

I had observed that around 70% of your posts for the past three days are totally useless flaming contents.
