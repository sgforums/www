Such a simple comment and you get so worked up. Go for anger management class or something. If you were to be less childish and have a better attitude, people would not have so much to say about you. And I said childish arguements because all of your arguements are extremely flawed and childish. The truth is, I find better things to do with my time, and hence do not entertain childish posts. Maybe you should find something better to do. This will be my last post to you regardless of whether you reply or not.<br><br>Everytime there is an arguement, 99% of the time it involves you.

From a different perspective, if the person mentioned does not bother with such comments, again such trivial things wouldn't happen. Sadly, this is not true for both cases. People cite examples, and people retaliate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First, let me apologise to all members. I understand that this is a redeployment thread, and I have no intention of hijacking this thread to turn it into a "Is 9806J childish?" thread, or some other thread with a similar title.<br><br>This would be my last reply to Scania, like in 9806J case, regardless of whether he replies or not.<br><br>Let me explain my earlier post, which I understand was provocative.<br><br>People cite others as examples or make comparison to other for the following reasons.<br><br>1. To provide evidence<br>2. To prove something<br>3. To give others a clearer picutre<br><br>In my case, it was reason no. 2.<br><br>I posted it to prove a simple point. And I successfully did so. It was to show that 9806J lack maturity. His reply "you want to get involved is it?" showed it all. After my reply to his comment, he replied again, sadly childishly. However, his decision to edit the post and remove his latest comment 10 minutes later shows that he has changed, for the better. I saw the reply but will not post it since he deleted it, which also shows that he does not mean whatever he wrote earlier.<br><br>Either way, I achieved what I wanted to do. And 9806J has evidently changed. So case closed.</div>
