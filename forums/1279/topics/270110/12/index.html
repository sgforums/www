To provide evidence<br>2. To prove something<br>3. To give others a clearer picutre<br><br>In my case, it was reason no. 2.<br><br>I posted it to prove a simple point. And I successfully did so. It was to show that 9806J lack maturity. His reply "you want to get involved is it?" showed it all. After my reply to his comment, he replied again, sadly childishly. However, his decision to edit the post and remove his latest comment 10 minutes later shows that he has changed, for the better. I saw the reply but will not post it since he deleted it, which also shows that he does not mean whatever he wrote earlier.<br><br>Either way, I achieved what I wanted to do.

I understand some ways have irritated some in the forum. I dont know why he without fail tries to insult me<br>Like what i want to say is that SBS9806J's mistakes or my mistakes has nothing to do with each other<br><br>HOW CAN WE STEREOTYPE EACH OTHER ACCORDING TO BLOOD TIES?<br><br>We lead our own life. But however, I really cannot tolerate the way 351M uses his language at us.<br>I do not wish to say this but  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Has 351M changed at all? I have yet to see it<br>I understand 9806J is childish at times<br>But 351M claims that 9806J does not know how to behave<br>Then what about SBS351M? Look at the language he used?<br>I will change, 9806J has evidently changed.<br>But what about 351M?<br>if he continues doing this to us, i really have no choice but to step in.<br>I do not wish to argue but, as an older bro, i have to do something<br><br>=========== PAGE BREAK<br>Anyway your words do make a huge impact<br>And i thank you for that.

            <div class='col-md body'>To 2671B<br><br>I understand your concern. Whether 351M changes or not should not be your main concern. Instead you should focus on changing yourself. If 351M does not change, he only stands to lose out. Like I said, if he wants to be rude, let him be. It just tells us all about the kind of person he is.<br><br>Whatever the case, you have a choice to not step in. Do not reply. Others on the forum will make judgments for themselves. You don't have to step in to tell them that 351M is at fault.<br><br>What 351M wants is to see you reply. It shows that he has successfully provoked you. If you were to ignore him, then someday he will stop.<br><br>Yes. I know you are thinking about 351M damaging your reputation, misleading others to think that you are a trouble maker etc etc. All along, you already admitted that you made mistakes just like everyone else. Most importantly, you decided to change. Trust me, a bad comment from one forum member does not impact your reputation significantly. The key to cleaning up your reputation is to prove it, not to rebut what others have to say. You just have to be polite, and treat others with respect. If others say something nasty, kindly explain your stand without vulgarities in a civilized manner. It takes time for people to change their impression of you, but if you try hard, people will see you differently in the near future.<br><br>Maybe it's time to stop protecting 9806J. Your brother has got to learn to face reality and should learn how to respond appropriately. You can't protect him forever anyway. Your protectionist behavior could very well be the reason why some people dislike you.<br><br>Lastly, 1049L has kindly reiterated my point, that is to not argue.<br><br>If you still have any other comments for me, I think PM would be the way to go. Remember: This is a redeployments thread.<br><br>Let us work towards having a pleasant and wonderful experience for all on Sg forums.<br>Happy discussing everyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
