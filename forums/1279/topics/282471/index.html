Now, I actually see him in sgforums, posting several new topics for people to brainstorm. What a big change in you. The best thing is that he creates a new topic without posting any ideas that he has brainstormed. LOL.<br><br>So, what wonderful ideas have you brainstormed though I am not very into singapore buses?

I think I should say ROFL.<br><br>This message is also a "good brainstorm" by our highly super intelligent bus fan from HK.<br><br>One more thing, I have forgotten to thank you for the increase in the activity rating of the forum.<br><br>Bus forum activity rating will soar. However, my fears are that it will become a forum for people to vent their anger after reading the first post by our highly intelligent BusHK1 while he tries very hard to agrue back, exposing his loopholes, agrue again and agrue back. Dingdong dingdong and so on and so forth.<br><br>He is trying to agrue back by looking at our loopholes rather trying to explain the loopholes that he has created. He is trying to avoid getting owned by lots of people that has found his loophole. I will just perceive him as someone who is trying to hide and avoid thousands of qns asked by our curosity Singapore bus forums fans.<br><br>As a guest, a bus fan from HK should have made a formal and polite introduction instead of just whining and whining, creating 600+ replies and running away from his loopholes created. Is there how HK bus fans behave? I guess that our dear BusHK1 is somehow tarnishing HK bus fans reputation and image.<br><br>Bus forum is becoming a forum catered to vent our frustuations, anger in my opinion judging by how "hot the topics are".<br>It is sometimes sad to see or imagine a person with such a personality, being discriminating and bias in the first place. Maybe I shouldn't even bother in the frist place like what I am doing now.<br><br>Just a thought.<br><br></div>
