              <p>For sv50 I will like to defer. The bus has extremely high loading during AM peak. I have noticed around 30-40 pax take the bus from Bishan itself to AMK Ave 5 (those who transfer from CCL) and then there is also a big crowd getting in at AMK Int. Though at AMK Ave 5, the bus becomes empty and has less than 20 pax on board. Again towards Sengkang Int, it can have high loading if it comes before 163.</p>
              <p>So for 50's case I can still validate the use of DDs. It really helps with sharing the loading on 159 and 88 and in Sengkang area with 163 and 372.</p>

              <p>The Citaro placement between 2 DDs is good and I appreciate it. But do you know there are times when the Citaro comes before the DD, and you can see people cramped like crazy.</p>
              <p>It is not always that the Citaro will stick to its timing. Even if it is 3-4 mins late, it can cause high loading that the Citaro cannot manage, delaying it even further, and disrupting the schedule. The Wright then comes and sticks to its butt with around 50-60 pax when it has capacity to take 120.</p>

              <p><br>but then you have 136 during morning peak to cope with the spot loading. And yes 139 with 2 DDs was fine, anyway an extra one doesn't hurt but there is not DD capacity loading between Farrer and Bukit Merah. It is the 139A area where loading is good which is mitigated with 139A in place.</p>

              <p>You can always see the upper deck of a 119 wright is forever empty. Not even 75% of the top deck is seated.<br><br>Plus it goes empty after Sengkang towards Punggol.</p>

              <p><br>But it is a wrong decision. Rather give those 2 Wrights to 87 and 168 where you will at least see 50 pax on board if not more. With 119, the peak loading is 50-60 pax and that too at 2-3 stops.</p>
              <p>Between Sengkang and Punggol forever empty, like 10-15 pax on board for a huge capacity bus. </p>

              <p>wrong.. during peak hours, i think those paxs would rather wait for a DD to come.... rather than boarding that crowded citaro and stand all the way from WDL to Tampines/bedok (or vice versa)...</p>

              <p>For sv50 I will like to defer. The bus has extremely high
              loading during AM peak. I have noticed around 30-40 pax take the
              bus from Bishan itself to AMK Ave 5 (those who transfer from CCL)
              and then there is also a big crowd getting in at AMK Int. Though at
              AMK Ave 5, the bus becomes empty and has less than 20 pax on board.
              Again towards Sengkang Int, it can have high loading if it comes
              before 163.</p>
              <p>So for 50's case I can still validate the use of DDs. It really
              helps with sharing the loading on 159 and 88 and in Sengkang area
              with 163 and 372.</p>

              <p>30-40 pax use citaro enough already...and further not each bus from AMK there are full (there are 159/159B as well).. no need put so many Wrights on Sv50... 4 wrights more than enough. those excess wrights can be put to other service instead.. for example, Sv72 or Sv88.......</p>

              <p>I have a different view point on sv 50. It is an enabler if I can say. Having Wrights on it helps reduce the load on 159 to ITE in morning peak at the same time is another alternative to Seagate that encourages a few passengers to take the bus from Jubilee rather than 88 from AMK Ave 3.</p>
              <p>Again, it helps people on Sengkang West, East Ave, Anchorvale to reach Sengkang by the fastest route, so there can be spot loading for this service in this area.</p>
              <p>In morning peak, I have also observed people from Punggol East Way taking bus to Sengkang, where earlier they relied on 85 that is a longer route or 62 that took them to Hougang.</p>
              <p>The loading on 50 is the best among 4, 116, 120... Also to your point 72 and 88 have required fair number of DD upgrades. 72 had 21 DDs last year, today it has 28. 88 has 22 DDs last year, today it has 28 DDs and that too full fleet DDs. Major improvement by SBST and managing both services very well.</p>
              <p>In fact, sv 72 DDs hardly cross 60 pax now days because of the improved frequency. You have a bus every 05 minutes.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I would also like to add that the loading on sv 50 will go on increasing because the route is well designed to cater to future upcoming HDB and condominium projects along Punggol Cove, Anchorvale, Sengkang West Ave, Seletar, Buangkok Drive. </p>
              <p>I see huge potential in the loading of sv 50 in coming months.</p>
