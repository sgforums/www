Only the 1st batch Habits (voith) and 2nd batch Habits and Volgren bendies were equipped with the additional intercooler .

But i only noticed that the Habits that caught fire were the first batch ZF Habits , which were only equipped with a turbocharger WITH NO intercooler* .<br><br>If ZF bendies were the main cause , then the 2nd batch , which were equipped with an additional intercooler * should also have caught fire as well .<br><br>The engine with NO intercooling , OM447hA produces only 900Nm of torque max while the engine with intercooling , OM447hLA produces 1100Nm torque max* .

            <div class='col-md body'>Bus fires normally are due to the following:<br>(1) brake seizure- Volvo running on Z cam systems are extremely prone to jamming.<br>(2) Turbo Chargers- The turbocharger is jammed or lack of lubrication from the EO directly tapped from the oil filter.<br>(3) Electrical faults- Common in all sorts of vehicles.<br>(4) fuel leakage- Petrol engines will be very prone to fire if fuel lines leak. But diesel merely causes smoke with the current bus operations. To burst into fire with diesel is not easy.<br>(5) ATF leakage- ATF is combustible even though the temperature required to burn it is very very high and almost unlikely in normal conditions. The Exxonmobil ATF requires up to 200DegC to burn as demonstrated by SBS Technical Service Team before. But as ATF is a very commonly circulated fluid in the buses, for it to leak onto hot surfaces and cause smoke mistaking it to be fire is common.<br><br>I am not saying that there will not be other possibilities but they are really too low. (1) to (3) are the most common. (4) and (5) are not common. In fact I have yet to hear about diesel and ATF causing fire on buses.<br><br>Intercoolers have nothing to do with fire or not normally. There are basically 2 intercoolers in the buses. One is the turbo intercooler which helps to cool down the force fed air into the combustion chambers as turbo induced force fed air also carry the hot air into the combustion chamber. The high air temperature does not execute combustion as effective. The hot air is circulated around the coolant in 2 different passages. Therefore transfering the heat to the coolant which in turns dissipates it at the radiator.<br>The other intercooler is the gearbox intercooler whereby the ATF that is used to operate the gearbox requires to be cooled constantly. Therefore an intercooler allows the ATF to circulate around the coolant in 2 different passages. So that the heat can be transferred to the coolant which will dissipate off at the radiator.</div>

Another problem is the hot running turbocharged engine . The horizontal placement of the engine meant more space is permitted in the passenger compartment , however , the engine is placed inside a tight area , .I found this info from a website , but im not sure whether its true or not . Pardon me if that is not true . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Another reason for bendy buses overheating and catching fire is the tendency "for articulated buses to use the same engine as non-articulated buses; this leads to a slower speed and acceleration, due to an increase of weight. When used in cities with many slopes (e.g. Vancouver, B.C. or San Francisco, California) the vehicle is prone to overheating, leading to stalling in the milder case and a fully fledged fire in the worst case. ", according to wikipedia.<br><br></div></blockquote>Placement has nothing to do with it.  I would say that it is the result of high revving at low speeds (ie 60km/h).  An O.405G went up in flames for Travel West Midlands in the UK a few years ago.<br><br>While the same engine is used in an artic, the engine itself has higher power and torque than the standard non-turbo or low-boost turbo engine variants in the rigid O.405.
