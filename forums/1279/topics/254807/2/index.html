London can afford to have their Citaro Gs taken off the road circa 2003/2004 because they had let some routemasters run a little bit longer to temporarily replace the Citaros. SMRT cannot use anything to replace their bendies except ehir UDs, even so, there would not be enough buses. probably have to follow TIBS, lease buses from SBS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have seen one vehicular fire at Bukit Batok before (Toyota Hiace, YG9933-), the driver tried to extinguish the fire with an extinguisher but the fire was just overwhelming and within 30 seconds the entire front of the van was engulfed. The flames reached 5 metres and above and the driver had no choice but to look on in despair as the flames burnt the van away, the civil defence arrived five minutes later and even with proper equipment, took another five minutes to secure the area and put out all isolated fires on the van.<br>Compare it to a bus, its much of a problem, bigger, hotter engine, bigger area (more combustables), and the heat, even standing far away, its really a hell of a big stench and heat (like next to an oven)...<br>So kudos to the civil defence crew that saved the bus under such circumstances, I believe many saw MAN among other bands of buses burnt to destruction on the North South Highway without any extinguishers/fire rescue crew within tens of kilometres, I have saw many much (but sadly no pictures...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FIRST, there was some smoke. And then his car went up in flames - along with $15,000 in cash.<br>Click to see larger image<br><br>Mr Ngoh Lim Seng, 51, an operations supervisor, said he had kept a plastic bag containing the cash next to him in the car.<br><br>He was on his way to pay the eight workers under him their half-monthly salary.<br><br>Mr Ngoh was driving out from his HDB estate along Tampines Avenue 4 on Tuesday afternoon when he noticed smoke coming out from the bonnet of his 16-year-old Honda Civic.<br><br>'I got out to take a look and the next thing I knew, a fire had broken out,' he said.<br><br>'A few people nearby tried to put out the fire but it didn't help.'<br><br>Within minutes, the flames engulfed the entire car.<br><br>Curious passersby and residents also gathered, and some of them took pictures of the burning car.<br><br>Mr Winston Lee, 26, a car polisher, said the smoke was so thick it was 'impossible to see the inside of the car'.<br>Click to see larger image<br>Mr Ngoh, with his burning car. --<br><br>SMELT SMOKE<br><br>He had smelt the smoke from two blocks away.<br><br>The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call about the car just before 4.40pm.<br><br>Two fire bikes and a fire engine were sent to the scene, and the blaze was put out in five minutes.<br><br>When The New Paper arrived, Mr Ngoh had a charred bundle of what looked like currency notes.<br><br>It was a little thicker than a school notebook, and on some notes, the serial numbers could still be seen.<br><br>Mr Ngoh declined to let us photograph the notes.<br><br>He said he also lost some official documents which he had kept in his car.<br><br>'I'm upset and very hurt - this car has gone everywhere with me,' he said.<br><br>His wife, who rushed to the scene on hearing the news, said Mr Ngoh had spent more than $10,000 replacing worn-out parts of his car over the years.<br><br>Said Madam Wendy Toh, 45, a housewife: 'He never spent so much money or effort to take care of any of our two previous cars.'<br><br>The couple, who have a 20-year-old son, were grateful to those who tried to help put out the fire.<br><br>Mr Raymond Chun, 37, shopkeeper at an electronics store nearby saw the smoke and ran to help.<br><br>DIVERTED TRAFFIC<br><br>Said Mr Chun: 'I took a mini fire extinguisher that I keep in my car and tried to help put out the flames but they just became bigger and bigger.'<br><br>A larger extinguisher kept in the shop was of no help either.<br><br>He and his colleague ended up helping to divert traffic away from the burning car 'just in case the car exploded'.<br><br>Four former Temasek Polytechnic students from India, who live in a flat overlooking the spot, were shocked and 'a little scared' by the fire.<br><br>One of them, a 20-year-old who gave his name only as Adarsh, said he had recorded the entire incident using his handphone camera.<br><br>The video clip showed several small explosions as the car burnt.<br><br>So, is there any hope that Mr Ngoh may be able to recover his company's money?<br><br>He would not comment further, but a bank officer who declined to be named said that if the notes are badly burnt or mutilated, the bank would not accept them.<br><br>A check with sources in the insurance industry showed that usually only the car is covered, and not what is in it. So a claim for property destroyed in such an accident was unlikely.<br><br>SCDF is investigating the fire.<br><br><img src="http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/7836/npimagesllfiretlr3.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i1.tinypic.com/6cy9sb7.jpg"><br><br>==============================================================<br><br>In another traffic incident, a car caught fire along Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 2 on Thursday afternoon.<br><br>Part of the vehicle's engine melted and windows cracked.<br><br>Emergency crews managed to put out the fire quickly, but the damage was done.<br><br>No one was injured.<br><br></div>
