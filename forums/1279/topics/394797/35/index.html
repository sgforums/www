              Nope i disagree,A lot of buses wasted fuel just to start from Lor 1.Since AMDEP take over a few duties the freq is slightly better although its still sucks by today's standard.Last time more worse,Jam dont say.

              But given that AMDEP still control 3-4 duties its obviously that start from Lor 1 is essential plus the trips to AMDEP from Lor 1 is much nearer than KJDEP.Do you know that Several 961/985 AMDEP SLs stays within Kallang/Beach Rd/Aljunied/Eunos/Bedok area?

              WLDEP can easily park 300 buses and Woodlands Regional Interchange can park 90 buses at ease..Several Bus Plus buses from AMDEP can also park at the depot too.
              
              KJDEP can use Bt Panjang for ONP.
              
              AMDEP can park at Sembawang Int for 859,882,980 and a few 169/171/858 buses there

              <p>I think there was a mistake for making all BPJ services KJDEP controlled in 2008 (except 177 since they change only at BBT only I think) by making 61, 173 &amp; 177 WL controlled, you should what happened to 920/922 after that, went back to WLDEP again after 2 months of stint at KJDEP.</p>
              <p>Now, finally, make 61 &amp; 173 back to KJDEP controlled, 75, 184 back to WL controlled, return to the glory days. So, it is wise to make BPJ 50 KJ, 50 WL controlled while for 926 can go WL controlled. Very weird, the only WRI service with KJ controlled (except for 925 which start duty form CCK I think)</p>

              <p>If make 852 back to partial KJ, how to change duty roster? 852
                                      WL/AM is still better since both sides can change their duty roster
                                      at Yishun and from WLDEP to BBT is not really that far and KJDEP is
                                      almost near to WLDEP. (nearer than from WLDEP to Boon Lay), <strong>it is
                                      not like asking you to drive form Singapore to Thailand like that

              <p>-If 853 and 854 were under WLDEP and were to start trip at GL1/UEC*(an example)under WLDEP duty block I think you will complain let alone driving from Singapore to thailand.</p>

              <p>S.Solitare, I am wearing a pair of spectacles now, and I see through those lens your every single actions aginst me, and other bus enthusiasts. I see you telling me not to be political, yet at the same time trying to induce me to provide a political reply. I see you calling me a fool. I see, through your Facebook block list, and how you are insulting me. I see you trying to start a flame war. I see you not being happy with me and wanting to reply, probably in the processusing some wonderful four-letter words that "I have never heard of before". I see you acting as some kind of big shot, I see you repeatedly raise the case of someone being sacked. I even see you trying to gather evidence against some of us enthusiasts. Your actions thus far have spokn for themselves, they tell a lot about you as a person, and your character.</p>
              <p>To everyone reading this, mark my words. My name is Joey, and I stand by this message. No longer will I stand by, looking at this collapsing community named "bus enthusiasts" develop more cracks, and having some other people trying to aggrevate it, and not do anything.</p>
              <p>This is enough.</p>
              <p>It shall be the end of an era of supression, an end to communism, an end to unreasonable actions, and the beginning of an new era where people pursuing their hobbies need not engage in politics, where enthusiasts can simply talk all about their hobby. No fear of being sabotaged by other groups. A united community, where everyone enjoy their hobby.</p>
              <p>Once a bus enthusiast, forever a bus enthusiast.</p>
