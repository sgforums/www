But it seems rather unconvincing isn't it? That means the Nissan UDS, the old DAF SB220LT buses are also Euro I compliant?</p>
              <p>For Leyland Olympian, I have an old newspaper cutting advertising the then-new buses. It only mentioned these buses are greener as they uses CFC free refrigerants for the A/C. There was no mention of Euro I thingy.</p>
              <p>There's another article mentioning the then-new first batch of Volvo Olympian buses. <em>"They are environmentally friendly and meet the latest European community exhaust emission standards, making them the "cleanest" buses on the roads."<br></em></p>

              <p>debut means that a specific model of bus doing a svc for the very 1st time while cameo means that a bus from different service coming to do a certain other service, although it, or a bus of similar model have done the service previously...</p>

              SB220LT buses are also Euro I compliant?</p>
              <p>For Leyland Olympian, I have an old newspaper cutting
              advertising the then-new buses. It only mentioned these buses are
              greener as they uses CFC free refrigerants for the A/C. There was
              no mention of Euro I thingy.</p>
              <p>There's another article mentioning the then-new first batch
              of Volvo Olympian buses. <em>"They are environmentally
              friendly and meet the latest European community exhaust emission
              standards, making them the "cleanest" buses on the
              roads."<br></em></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>What i mean is that buses might have produced pollutants within Euro I guidelines, but it has not been certified to be Euro I. This happens because the Euro I standard was only drafted in 1992, so some buses designed before this period would have met the standards, but not officially certified to be Euro I.</p>

              <p>The problem is, they don't. And the VSO will only last for

              <p>7-9 only??</p>
              <p>Then why get COE when it lasts only 1 year more than that?</p>
              <p>Why refurbish the old buses?</p>
              <p>Why even bother to buy buses when they are going to last only 17 years anyway?</p>

              <p>The manual wheelchair ramp, special bells and the wheelchair backing which is all paid for by the govt. It only costs <strong>$6000</strong> for each CDGE B9 to be equipped with WAB friendly features. That's about 1% of the cost of each double deck bus.</p>
              <p>Converting the B10TL and the B10BLE will cost slightly more for workmanship costs, but this is not expected to be a problem because the B10TL and B10BLE is provisioned to have a wheelchair ramp installed. (E.g. HK's VSO, UK's B10BLE).</p>

              <p>SMC Transit doors (the brand of doors on the KUBs, Volgren bendies etc.) are quite low quality imo. You see the Volgren bendies, going over bumps causes the doors to jump about, some even opening abit.....</p>
