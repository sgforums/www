              <p><br>If her house bus stop is at Jurong West St 61, I would suggest to walk to Jurong West St 62 where Blk 622 is and try to take Service 257 in addition to 243G.</p>
              <p>If its near Jurong West Ave 4 Blk 705, then walk to Pioneer Rd North Blk 705 (same block) and try Service 179 or 241 to Pioneer MRT instead.</p>
              <p>If its anywhere at St 81, cross the road and take 243W instead.</p>
              <p>That's the reason why there's more buses on 243W instead as most ppl at St 8x will take 243W to Boon Lay as its deemed nearer. 243G has other alternatives to get to Boon Lay Int and they are within walking distance.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT: 966AM01 where 966 = sv no, AM = duty type, 01 = duty sequence number. Duty type consists of AM, PM, S1, S2 and TQ. Since the duty sequence no for each type of duty restarts itself, this means there's PM01, AM01, TQ01 etc.</p>
              <p>SBST: 1A where 1 = duty no, A = duty type. It goes in ascending duty number order, followed by duty type. A, P, S, E, T, N. Each duty number is unique on its own means you wont find a Duty 1A and Duty 1P/1S/1T on the same service. There's no service no tied to the duty code unlike SMRT.</p>
              <p>This is just the basic understanding. There;s still somemore on how to differentiate other stuff.</p>
