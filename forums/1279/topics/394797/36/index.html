              <p>politically correctness in your usage is grossly misintepreted. if you truly wanted to be politically correct, you'd keep privileged information strictly for your own consumption and not flash it around by telling the whole world that you have it.</p>

              <p>Insult? It's the fact. Grow up and stop complaining. Starting a flame war? Ha! Am I so free in the first place? Do u see me posting pix of buses everyday? That u will have to go and find out. C'mon, why can't I mention incidents? They are there to teach us a lesson... But unfortunately some treat it as if they had won the war and wanna disrupt more and more... Sorry uh, there's always a saying that goes: Do not judge a book by it's cover. So, are u trying to judge me? Try harder next time... </p>
              <p>And, please la, next time wan take interior pix ask the driver first la. Board and then as if the whole bus is urs alr. Snap here snap there. Even the driver also snap har? U are so selfish by doing that. Please, spare a thought for other's privacy. U think they want to appear in ur bloddy pixs?</p>
              <p>1 word to describe the whole incident. "Disgraceful"</p>

              <p>non-existent guilty conscience, you mean? i don't know what exactly happened, and frankly im not too concerned anyway. just that it's frustrating and very irritating to keep seeing names being thrown around on forums and even facebook without rhyme or reason.</p>

              <p>Are u blind? Or simply stupid? Or both? Did u see me snapping
              every rare cameos like that fella who always wanna post everything
              first in his blog? Misuse? No. I old school style bus camping and
              spotting. I'm not like some idiots who always ask others like,
              "where is 8033D lols", and always wanna show off his pix. </p>

              <p>sorry eh, but i was just asking a question. no need to continue with the insults, it doesnt help anybody. and i dont see why you need to bring in the issue of snapping every rare cameo here.</p>
