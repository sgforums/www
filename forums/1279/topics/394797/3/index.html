              <p>159 is due to the Lorong Chuan CTE bridge, only less than 4m if im not wrong. Same applies to why 105 can't get DDs now.<br></p>

              <p>i don't think 130 needs DD at the moment. the current fleet is enough to handle the load. it served me pretty well for nearly 10 years. in the past it had NAC DD before.</p>

              <p>159 is due to physical restrictions as mentioned by VO.</p>

              <p>I believe that the rest could be due to demand not warranting DDs, although 156 is a notable exception...</p>
