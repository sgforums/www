               <p>SBS9888Y initially started off with HGDEP 87, I still remember Dr Teo Chee Hean launching SBST's first low floor Superbus way back in 1999. SBS9888Y was last deployed on HGDEP 154 and it followed service 154 over to AMDEP/BRBP controlled in 2004.</p>
                  <p>SBS9889U was all the while under BBDEP since new in 2005. It was never under HGDEP all these while.</p>

              <p>Now, besides 100, there is one more svc I must reflect about regarding WAB: <strong>354</strong>.</p>
              <p>354: The two scania put there really waste loh...why must put there when the only places 354 can play with is along Jalan Lorong Besar and that the only people who take 354 is those aunties who goes out to Pasir Ris during weekdays to do their grocery shopping. Other times they just jump into the family car with the family when the husband not working, since they all rich what(the houses all bungalows/hgh class condo)! They break their leg, naturally someone else take over, which eases the use of 354 WAB. So SBS nothing better to do go upgrade 354's whole fleet into WAB IN ONE SHOT without even thinking its needs.</p>
              <p>Now, one may also ask me: from downtown east to PR int leh? Well, 21 has been the FIRST WAB since after it was upgraded donkey years ago. Try that. You would find that since it's DD, you would not have people blocking your way and your PIW parking bay.

              <p>Now, besides 100, there is one more svc I must reflect about regarding WAB: <strong>354</strong>.</p>
              <p>354: The two scania put there really waste loh...why must put there when the only places 354 can play with is along Jalan Lorong Besar and that the only people who take 354 is those aunties who goes out to Pasir Ris during weekdays to do their grocery shopping. Other times they just jump into the family car with the family when the husband not working, since they all rich what(the houses all bungalows/hgh class condo)! They break their leg, naturally someone else take over, which eases the use of 354 WAB. So SBS nothing better to do go upgrade 354's whole fleet into WAB IN ONE SHOT without even thinking its needs.</p>
