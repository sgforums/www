For me, I heard it from a friend of mine who was attached to SBS Braddell Depot as a Bus Technician. I would very much like to see how SBST is going to convert these buses, considering a typical aircon unit for a DD weighs as much as 500kg!<br><br>As for the Volvo MK2 and the N113 CRB, they will stay for at least another 2 years. Remember that the Government has raised the statutory age limit for buses from 15 years to 17 years. Heard from a credible source that SBST might purchase more single decks as they will be focussing more on short-haul routes. Even then, the possibility of newer double-decks couldn't be ruled out.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>
