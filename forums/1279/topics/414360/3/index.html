              <p><br>106 would be better off if goes back to full KJDEP. It makes no sense for partial AMDEP controlled whereas others like 700 and 970 are full KJDEP.</p>
              <p>852 would be good if back to partial KJDEP controlled. Back to the old times with perm DAFs once again.</p>
              <p>980 was ever made full AMDEP before in Sept 2004 when new cross border service 950 was introduced. But for whatever reasons, WLDEP took back minority control of 980 in Oct 2004. Ever since then some of 980's duties had been bounced between AMDEP and WLDEP.</p>
              <p>I would rather 882 and 981 to come under the same depot, regardless of AMDEP or WLDEP. It makes no sense for 2 Sembawang short haul services, 1 come under AMDEP while another under WLDEP.</p>

              <p>I disagree with all. 975 I don't see a problem under KJ, afterall it's near, along with 700. 852 I strongly disagree being under KJ due to the location. as for the rest like 106 and 167 are due to historical reasons.</p>

              <p><br>U seems to fancy service 852 under WLDEP huh? Personsally I feel that service 852 should be under partial KJDEP too as it falls under BBT route group (all other BBT services are under KJDEP and it's rather awkward for only 852 to be under WLDEP down there). Also there's an advantage for service 852 buses to do overnite parking at BBT too.</p>

              <p>No need 970 can just get some OCs by handing some duties to AMDEP due to Shenton Way , to go back to KJDEP from Shenton Way is too far , time-wasting &amp; fuel wasting , AMDEP on the other hand , will be much better , nearer to Shenton Way &amp; runtime will be much shorter as the distance isnt that far compared to KJDEP.</p>
              <p>My suggestions is:</p>
              <p>75: AMDEP/WLDEP ( WLDEP is too far from Marina Centre)</p>
              <p>77: Loop at Marina Centre ( or perhaps like 857? hand 2 or 3 duties to AMDEP)??</p>
              <p>106: AMDEP/KJDEP ( due to Shenton Way)</p>
              <p>167: AMDEP/WLDEP ( due to Bt Merah , can go back to AMDEP by CTE , nearer)</p>
              <p>171: Full AMDEP ( as AMDEP is nearer to both Marina Centre &amp; Yishun)</p>
              <p>176: AMDEP/KJDEP: ( AMDEP control minority due to Bt Merah)</p>
              <p>178/187: KJDEP/WLDEP ( KJDEP is much nearer to BNL compared to WLDEP) If KJ takes over , high chance to see Dafs on 178/187.</p>
              <p>190: AMDEP/KJDEP ( NBR Terminal is nearer to AMDEP)</p>
              <p>852: AMDEP / KJDEP: ( It doesnt make sense to be controlled under WL as BB Int is further away from WLDEP instead of KJDEP , this is the only service at BB to be controlled under WLDEP , can just hand over to KJ &amp; park overnight at BB Int)</p>
              <p>961/980/985: Under AMDEP control due to Geylang Lor 1 Ter which is nearer to AMDEP</p>

              <p>In Jan 2001, service 167 and 980 were then made dual AMDEP/WLDEP whereas 851 went back to full AMDEP.</p>

              <p>Neh i dun think Bt Merah is nearer to AMDEP.Shenton Way also.If you say Marina Centre at least make more sense.I see no point AMDEP take over some duties for 106/970..Wasted time and fuel.Sembawang service should let WLDEP full control except for 980 for Lor 1 side.Oh BTW heard that AMDEP will rent the piece of land just infront of the depot gate for bus parking exclusively for bendys,Maintenance,Bus wash and fuel refill still at the main depot.Guess 50-60 bendys can park there.</p>

              <p>But SBST places MRC, Shenton and Chinatown terminals under BSH control, meaning AMDEP responsibility. I don't see why SMRT can't have buses running between AMDEP and Shenton Way considering the two operators are neighbours at AMK Ind Pk 3.</p>

              <p>GLBP ardy public carpark with exceptional lots that are for bus plus and few SMRT UDs there how do you expect Sv like 61 bendies,67,961,985,980 to park there when currently its packed?Unless SMRT lease all the lots there and built proper refuelling and 1 auto bus wash machine and we can start discussing.</p>
