              <p>LATEST SEEN (5-6pm)</p>
              <p>1) 4 Bus 99 came at one time.<br>2) 3 Bus 143 came at one time<br>3) 2 Bus 78 came at one time(3 Bus 78 came at one time)*<br>4) 4 Bus 183 came at one time<br>5) 2 Bus 79 came at one time</p>
              <p>*Bus Service 78 has 3 buses from Clementi-Jurong east inter.The first and second bus is very near to each other.However the third bus is not far away.So how can you explain that??<br>Not just that,the fourth bus is the furthest away from the third bus.(Third bus is in indutrial sites(Pandan Road near Koon Bldg) but the fourth bus is at the West Coast Road near Tanglin Sec Sch.<br><br>The bus I am boarding is heading Clementi and you know what??It is quite crowded because the bus before is 15 mins ago and the one behind us is 5 mins.You can see such a big difference in the bus frequency.Why is this so??</p>

              <p>LATEST SEEN (9-10am)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*Bus Service 78 AGAIN has 3 buses from Clementi-Jurong east inter.The first and second bus is very near to each other.(BOTH at Pandan Garden).the third at Pandan Road.The fourth bus at West Coast Road.</p>
              <p>This is tyo show the freuqency got a serious problem here.(3rd and 4th)Living in the West there are lots of jams and terrible ones BUT NOT buses making jams instead it is cars and other transportation--lorries and container lorry.</p>
              <p>I posted this to let you know this kind of things does not happen OCCASIONALLY but almost EVERYDAY.I guess youall will understand me.</p>

              <p>The bus frequency of SBS Transit 78 is inconsistence ang I had found out the reason on 19 July 2011 ,Tuesday.According to eyewitness,it is the heavy traffic at west Coast Road and Clementi Avence 2 as well as Commonwealth Avence West.It has the worst jams and somemore they are together.it can take up to 20mons to go to the Clementi Central.In conclusion,if there are more frequency on this service,it does not make any difference as the buses will either join together in the end or very far from one another.</p>

              <p>Below is the list of jams near Clementi area or Bukit Batok and Jurong area.</p>
              <p>Jams in Singapore(Clementi-Jurong area)<br><br>1)Clementi Avence 6 from PIE to AYE (Weekdays Morning only)<br>2)Clementi Avence 6 from AYE and Commonwealth Ave West to PIE (Weekdays Night only)<br>3)Commonwealth Ave West to Clementi Avence 3to CP 20(Jam all the way to Clementi Avence 6 or Clementi Avence 2<br>or from Clementi Avence 6 till Commonwealth West to CP 20)<br>4)Clementi Avence 2 goes towards Commonwealth Avence West from West Coast Road<br>5)West Coast Road from West Coast Highway all the way to Clementi Avence 2 to Commonwealth Avence West<br>6)Commonwealth Avence West from Boon Lay Way and Toh Tuck Ave towards Clementi Central before Clementi<br>Avence 6<br>7)Bukit Batok East Avence 3 from Bukit Batok Street 23 and Bukit Batok Central to Toh Tuck Avence<br>8)Jurong Town Hall Road from After Jurong East Central to AYE/Teban FlyOver.<br>9)North Buona Vista Road/Buona Vista FlyOver from Dover Road to AYE</p>
              <div id="post-body-10304689" class="body">
              <p>The current road condition in Clementi is bad enough because<br>1.There are a lot fo private condo buses parking in the bus stops---Eg,The Chevrons,The Botonia,The Infinti,The Carellia (spelling might be error)<br>There will be 5 private buses at one time and CAUSED JAMS.<br>2.There are railings as you had mentioned.<br>3.The taxi did not obey the principle as there only wirtten MAX 3 TAXIS but it can go all the way up to 10 taxis<br>4.There are some inconsiderate drivers who tend to park/wait the cars there as some might just buy food or deposit/withdraw cash so they park thier cars<br>at LANE 1.By doing so,it had taken up the Lane 1 with the Taxis as well and Priavte buses<br><br>and dont worry,it had been jamming there since 6 years ago in 2005 as I lived there so long I had get used to it.So with the New Clementi Bus Interchange,<br>it will make no difference even if it skipped the current old bus stops and go to interchange straight away.<br><br>Our conditions were like Nex@Serangoon.The
              
              road got 3 lanes.SAME AS OURS and jams all over.Anyway we did say we will ike to have 1-2 more lanes so it has 5 lanes but it is rather<br>impossible due to too cramped.</p>
