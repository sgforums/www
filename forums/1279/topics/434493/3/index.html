              <p>Thats a pretty flawed comparison, there's many countries that have very punctual bus services and timetables, but pay attention to their timetable. Not many of it have frequency of less than 15mins.</p>
              <p>Its not possible to simply compare services between countries this way, because of the frequency of our services here in sg, and more importantly, the traffic situation in our country. Services that run in rural areas in Japan, even Taiwan and USA have very punctual buses, but their buses arnt subjected to multiple buses calling at a single bus stop at the same time, nor the heavy traffic situation, and definately not the tremendous amount of traffic lights our buses go thru on their journey.</p>
              <p>A fairer comparison would be with services in the cities of countries, which in this regard, sbst is doing relatively ok and smrt less so.</p>
              <p>Lastly, i would say its not feasible to run services at such frequencies as proposed unless #1. the loading supports it (or changes to support it), or #2. smaller capacity vehicles are deployed just to cater to lower demand routes to make it run at higher frequency. (e.g darts).</p>
              <p>Bus companies have to factor in the loading factor/percentage of each route before deciding what kind of vehicles, and frequency is suitable in order to maintain a breakeven with its costs.

              <p>how do we explain? when you want better frequency, you will see this more often.. bus bunch also complain. buses come slightly later also complain...</p>
              <p>want to know the reasons? all due to traffic conditions and number of passengers. even if the bus depart at fixed timing and arrive at the specifc time at the first bu stop, the number of paxs boarding and alighting each bus WILL BE DIFFERENT.. this will either delay the trip or push forward the trip if the bus no need to stop for few stops (since no pax) thus it can travel faster and might catch up with the front bus...further traffic light can be one issue also... and vehicles travelling on bus lanes and even refused to give way to bus coming out of bus bays also caused the buses to delay.. in some bus stops, some buses have to wait at least 1 min out to filter out...even with the yellow boxes...</p>

              <p>LATEST SEEN (9-10am)</p>
              <p>*Bus Service 78 AGAIN has 3 buses from Clementi-Jurong east
              inter.The first and second bus is very near to each other.(BOTH at
              Pandan Garden).the third at Pandan Road.The fourth bus at West
              Coast Road.</p>
              <p>This is tyo show the freuqency got a serious problem here.(3rd
              and 4th)Living in the West there are lots of jams and terrible ones
              BUT NOT buses making jams instead it is cars and other
              transportation--lorries and container lorry.</p>
              <p>I posted this to let you know this kind of things does not
              happen OCCASIONALLY but almost EVERYDAY.I guess youall will
              understand me.</p>

              <p>you already say that there are a lot of jams in the west.. so how do you expect the buses to keep to their frequency? even with bus lanes, also no use... so many vehicles continue to use bus lanes... </p>
              <p>different buses/trips carry different number of passengers. you cant expect the buses to have same number of pax/same boarding /alighting time at each trip...... one bus stop longer at bus stop cos more pax want to board, will delay the bus.. then stop at more traffic light... got delay further, sooner or later, the behind bus will catch up, because it clear traffic light faster and have less pax....</p>

              <p>Erm, its not my problem. Its the way that things are being perceived by you.</p>
              <p>Long frequency is not a problem. It is only a problem when there is no timetable published for long frequency or a way to check when the bus is arriving.</p>
              <p>In many rural places in parts of this world, if there are buses that operate at 30 min - 1 hour interval, its is already considered good already. Some services can even end at 6pm for last bus. Please consider ourselves very lucky here.</p>
              <p>The problem that you probably want to address is overloading of buses, i.e. too many pax, not enough capcity to handle. Why would you want more frequent buses, and yet no one to take them? Just a waste of resources issnt it?</p>

              <p>i stay at amk ave 4. my bus stop have  76/268/269/CT8 going to AMK MRT..</p>
              <p>so in very ideal situation, SBST should plan that every 3 mins, there will be one bus (maybe 76) arriving at bus stop, sv268 arriving 3 mins later and sv269 another 3 mins later and then sv76 come again 3 mins later... this will be very ideal situation whereby each pax going to amk central wait only maximum 3 mins..</p>
              <p>but most of the time, it is not such, you will see sv268/76 arriving together, or even 76/268/269 arriving togetther at the bus stop... thus pax have to wait longer...  thus pax will definitely complain...</p>
              <p>the passengers really need to understand that it is very difficult for SBST to plan the exact schedule of buses arriving at each bus stop perfectly.. sv76/268/269 all start from different place.... even if they make the schedule so nice that every one sv268 bus wil arrive 3 mins after one sv76 bus, there is still sv269 schedule to consider...  and schedule is schedule, actual situation on the route will be different.... 10 to 15 mins wait should be quite reasonable...</p>

              <p><br>Hey!that is a good point.Thanks.And ya the purpose of me posting this topic as I would like to know the bus frequency is it practically affecting people.As what you said it means the long frequency is good enough and short frequency is ok as well because in our country this frequency is alright as compared to other countries and also short freuqncy enabled buses to occupy more passengers.Am I right? Thanks for all the support from you all guys.</p>

              <p>actually incidents of pax unable to board happens frequently, but to mitigate this pax can choose to leave home 20mins earlier to beat the jam or consider piecemeal trips under distance fares to complete their journey. however, there will always be pax on the losing end of the stick if the service is the only bus service into the area and they cannot board. just this morning i experienced it on Service 183 at the stop just before it enters Toh Guan Rd East. other notable examples of such services are services 35, 37, 78, 98, 169, 179, 856 &amp; 964.</p>
