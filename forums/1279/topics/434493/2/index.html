              <p>seem like a conflict in here.</p>
              <p>The purpose of my post is to have more awareness of bus services as frequency timing is too long already but I did not post in details.Just to let you know,some buses frequency that I post is to increase the waiting time but majority is to decrease the frequency time.</p>

                              <p>It is rampant and common that some buses come after waiting time
              of 30 to 45 mins.  Usually when this happen, the buses are
              full of passengers and leave no room for boarding
              passengers.   Understandable drivers just drive pass
              busstops. </p>

              the long run, it is questionable.   Sometimes even cause

              <p>Such kind of service the bus companies still dare ask for fare

              <p>You IQ is pretty low.  It is indicated clearly that the
              fare is 0.96 but the reduction of fared from the bus company was
              more than a $1 when I tapped my card.     Do
              you understand English, if not go back to school to learn
              English.</p>
              <p>There is no need to behave like you are such a big shot to bully
              people.    You are really very
              arrogant.    If you are so good then take over Lui
              Tuck Yew.   WtF!</p>
              <p>I see all you want is to bash me because I am not supporter of
              PAP and you are.    You are not even a loyal

                      <p>actually incidents of pax unable to board happens frequently, but to mitigate this pax can choose to leave home 20mins earlier to beat the jam or consider piecemeal trips under distance fares to complete their journey. however, there will always be pax on the losing end of the stick if the service is the only bus service into the area and they cannot board. just this morning i experienced it on Service 183 at the stop just before it enters Toh Guan Rd East. other notable examples of such services are services 35, 37, 78, 98, 169, 179, 856 &amp; 964.</p>

              <p>I tried to explain to you that Transitlink is the one i/c of the fare chart because I myself dealt with them over the fare charts at disputed bus stops. Then you started kpkbing abt e profits, now say i kpo, still dun want to give details.</p>
