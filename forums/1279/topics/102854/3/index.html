They have never thought of winning the competition on Singapore-Malaysian routes.<br><br>CW1 should 80sen from JB checkpoint to Kranji, I think. The price is about the same as 170. However, they are having a poor business because their boarding berth is located too far. People who get out of the JB checkpoint immigration counter will see 170 berth immediately, followed by 950 berth. CW 1 is about 50~80 metres away. People tend to travel in a more convenient way, thus, will try to walk less. And this might be one of the reason why CW is having a poor business.<br><br>Besides, last week I went to Malaysia, I saw that SBST 170X is taking passengers from Kranji MRT. [b]Yes, passengers no need to cross the overhead bridge anymore, they can take 170X from the bus stop beside "This Fashion".</strong> Like that, people sure will take the 170X buses, because they no need to cross the road anymore. Nevertheless, passengers still can board 170X, 170 and 160 when they cross the overhead bridge.<br><br>On the other hand, CW 1 does provides coin changing services, but their counter in the Kranjin MRT bus stop (opposite one), is a make shift one. Moreover, passengers have to get drenched to reach the counter when it rains. This is also another factor that CW1 is having a poor business.[/b]</blockquote>PJ, 170 charges in RM also... Like S$1.00 @ Kranji... RM1.00 from Kota Raya, so it is fair playing ground... Ya, should follow card fare, easier to complete... Like this very hard to complete... CW2 and SJE is at deadlock as of coin changing sv... I am thinking of asking SBS to have coin changing @ Kranji to make Handal Indah to go back to Malaysia... HI want to eat our business</div>

A simple post on extending 985 to Suntec City has degenerated into a slugfest about SMRT vs SBST, Handal Indah vs SBST etc etc. If not for these competition would SBST improve their services? Without CW1 or Sv 950 do you think SBST would even bother to bump the frequencies of 170 up and allow 170X to call ADJACENT to Kranji MRT?<br><br>And I am really inclined to think you haven't taken services like 965 or 969. I'm a relatively regular passenger of 969 and let me tell you, it has high passenger loads even during off peak hours. I strongly urge you not to go around spewing your vitirol when you don't even know what is going on in the first place.</div>
