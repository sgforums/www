              <p>Most likely the non WAB buses they will retain after this batch of new buses will be,</p>
              <p>- Volvo B10TLs</p>
              <p>- Volvo B10BLE CNGs</p>
              <p>- Volvo Olympian batch 3</p>

              <p>- Volvo B10M MK4 DM3500 and Striders</p>
              <p>And my guess is that after the B10TLs, the B10BLE CNGs might be the next batch to get EDS.</p>

              <p>But I have encountered incidents where people board from the rear door, don't tap the card and act blur when the BC ask the person to tap. These people are only willingly to cooperate until BC comes out of the driver cabin to tell the person.</p>
