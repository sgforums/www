            <div class='col-md body'>The project involves enchancement of the 17-year-old CCTV surveillance systems in use at SMRT stations with more than 120 digital videorecording (DVR) systems from MarchNetworksÂ™. Each of the 4000 Series DVRs will provide high speed, high resolution video and supports up to 16 cameras and 1.2 TB of internal storage. They can be integrated seamlessly with existing and new CCTV cameras. OÂ’ConnorÂ’s Singapore Pte. Ltd. is the systems integrator selected for the entire digital CCTV system expansion. The first phase of the overall SMRT project is expected to continue throughout 2004, with further phases planned for completion in 2006.<br><br>Let's take a look at the history of this CCTV row (news are copyright of respective news agency, which are acknowledged):<br><br><strong>Aug 20, 2004:</strong><br>Channel 8 News reported that the CCTV video recording systems are up at both Pasir Ris and Tampines MRT stations. There was also filming on the data centre used to store the images. But how many days the footage will be stored will be kept a secret for security purposes.<br><br><strong>Aug 18, 2004:</strong><br>SMRT should consider widening the safety zone - the distance between the yellow line and the edge of the platform - in stations with open platforms.<br><br>If it had been wider, the recent accident at Bukit Batok Station could have been averted. Mr Richard Chua could still have remained on the platform after he fell and be pulled to safety by other commuters.<br><br>With the present narrow safety zone, there is simply no way to fall without falling onto the track.<br><br>In driving, we are taught to keep at least 1m away from a stationary object. This is a reasonable safety zone. Why is it that this rule does not apply to trains? This safety improvement is very inexpensive to implement, nothing like a $280 million safety-door system. - ST<br><br><strong>August 16, 2004:</strong><br>With the first recording closed circuit television (CCTV) system at the Pasir Ris MRT station due to come into operation this week, a second man in just over a fortnight fell off an open platform onto the train tracks on Saturday afternoon.<br><br>While Warrant Officer Richard Chua, 47, survived being run over by four train carriages at the Bukit Batok MRT station, the incident lent emphasis to questions raised by the death of Mr Tan Keng Boon on July 28.<br><br>Yesterday, a relative of Mr Chua told Today that the father of four was "in stable condition" at the National University Hospital.<br><br>NewsRadio 93.8 reported that he had undergone surgeries for his injuries his toes were crushed, he suffered some cuts and he could feel no pain in his lower body.<br><br>On whether safety measures on open MRT platforms should be shored up, such as through the installation of safety barriers, the relative said: "We prefer to leave this to the public to suggest. As victims, we do not feel it is appropriate for us to comment."<br><br>Some commuters were more eager to speak. Mr Lim Boon Hee wrote to Today, saying: "These major lapses cause extreme inconvenience to thousands of commuters and yet the regulating authority still takes a benign stance on the SMRT's apparent inability or refusal to find a solution to rectify their open MRT stations from becoming death threats.<br><br>"Perhaps they have done their calculations and concluded it is cheaper to have train disruptions and charter buses than to spend some money erecting protective barriers at the open stations."<br><br>On Saturday, SMRT Corporation deployed 12 buses to ferry some 4,000 affected passengers.<br><br>In an earlier response to letters published in Today, the SMRT noted that that installing platform screen doors would cost an estimated $250 million. There are 35 open platform MRT stations along SMRT's North-South and East-West lines.<br><br>"This high capital outlay would have to be funded by commuters, which we would like to avoid. We will therefore continue to explore other more cost--effective solutions," SMRT said in its letter.<br><br>Reader Neo Wei Zong suggested having train captains "reduce the speed of the train to a crawl as they approach the station", avoiding serious injury "even if the train knocks into something".<br><br>Yesterday, Mr Goh Chee Kong, vice-president of corporate communications at the SMRT, said: "There is always public pressure for us to do more and we are looking into the matter. We have to let the investigations bear out first and take things in their perspective."<br><br>Preliminary findings in Saturday's incident suggest there was no foul play. Mr Chua's wife told reporters that he had been "very tired" lately and could have fainted.<br><br>The past 11 years have seen at least eight cases of people involved in accidents at open station platforms on the MRT and LRT system. <span style="color: red;"><strong>By October, cameras capable of recording will be in place at all elevated MRT station platforms.</strong></span> - TODAY</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>August 7, 2004:</strong><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) at the platforms of all MRT stations above ground level will have recording capability by October.</strong></span><br><br>The installation of the new digital recording equipment is to start in two weeks.<br><br>The recent accident at Bishan MRT station raised public's concern over the safety at the platforms of MRT stations which are above ground level.<br><br>Many asked why the CCTVs at the stations could not record activities on the platforms.<br><br>They felt it is also a pressing issue because of global terrorism.<br><br>But there is good news. Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) has speeded up the installation of recording capbility for all CCTV cameras at the platforms.<br><br>This is after the train operator received its first batch of equipment last week.<br><br>Besides speeding up the retrofitting works, SMRT will also increase the number of CCTV cameras from 840 to 978 by May next year.<br><br>The additional cameras will be spread out among all the stations.<br><br>The whole upgrading exercise will cost SMRT about S$7.8 million, and is scheduled to be completed by 2006.<br><br>To avoid inconveniencing passengers, installation work will only be carried out when the trains are not running, and that is only four hours a day.<br><br>Pasir Ris Station will be the first to be equipped with the new recorders.<br><br>The SMRT said cameras onboard the trains, which are used to monitor boarding and alighting, will also be upgraded from the analog system to a digital one.<br><br>With it, train officers not only get a clearer view of the platform and the stations, but storing digitised footage is also more convenient. - CNA<br><br><strong>July 30, 2004:</strong><br>The wife of the man killed at Bishan MRT station after being hit by a train, says her husband was feeling unwell.<br><br>She does not believe he took his own life and she is upset she may never know the truth because the closed circuit TVs at the station do not have a recording function.<br><br>There were also no guards patrolling the platform at that time.<br><br>Tan Keng Boon, 31, had just returned from a holiday in Italy with his family on Tuesday.<br><br>Barely 24 hours later, he was hit by a train at the Bishan station; he died on the tracks.<br><br>His wife, Karen Phang, says he had not been feeling well since the holiday.<br><br>"In the plane itself he was telling me he had jet-lag and chest pains and was feeling giddy. And he had a headache when he came back; he couldn't sleep the whole night," she said.<br><br>The mother of two is also determined to find out what exactly happened.<br><br>"I want to find out the truth. I don't care what the witnesses said. I want to see with my own eyes with the tape recorder, with the videocam," she said.<br><br>Mrs Tan was shocked to hear that the CCTV system at the Bishan station does not have a recording function.<br><br>In response, SMRT says it began installing new digital CCTVs with recording functions across the island early this year, but the company has not got around to Bishan yet.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">The upgrading of the CCTVs will only be complete in all stations by mid 2006.</span></strong><br><br>About 20 months ago, a 10-year-old boy fell on the tracks while playing, but he escaped with injuries.<br><br>As for suggestions to install platform doors or railings at all open stations, SMRT says it would cost up to S$250 million.<br><br>And having guards patrol the platforms at all times would cost more than S$5 million each year.<br><br>Such measures, says SMRT, will mean higher fares for all commuters. - CNA<br></div>

He was pronounced dead at 1.45pm.<br><br>Police have classified the case as unnatural death.<br><br>Mr Kel Chow, a witness, said he was on the north-bound train travelling from Toa Payoh to Ang Mo Kio when he felt the train come to a sudden stop near the Bishan station.<br><br>When he came out from the carriage, he saw a body lying on the rail track.<br><br>Mr Chow said he overheard a group of students saying that the man, who was earlier seen loitering around the train platform, had committed suicide.<br><br>The incident caused an hour-long disruption to the north-bound train service between Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio stations.<br><br>SMRT said passengers who were unable to complete their journeys due to the disruption can claim a full-fare refund at any MRT station's Passenger Service Centre within the next three working days.  - NewsRadio 93.8<br></div>

When you see the Woods Peppermint advertisement and you see this monorail coughing, you are actually looking at the KL Monorel.<br><br>Actually i think the monorails can't speed. I have seen the driver's console (the design was open style, jus a glass panel) and the top speed these monorails can travel are only 55kmph, compared to SKLRT's usual speed (not top speed, tat one i dunno) of 70-75kmph. I think BPLRT runs at around 50-55kmph also.<br><br>For your information, the jerking occurs as the trains slow down to a halt before stopping completely between the openings of the railings. this is due to it using four pressure brakes simultaneously to achieve a good braking effect, each just under the door.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we talk about accident prevention, CCTVs don't play a big role.

You are looking in the wrong direction if you think that CCTVs will prevent further deaths.<br><br>Our concentration should be on barriers and the "yellow line" buffer zone, because these two measures directly affect the outcome of any accidents that may happen.

There are people who think that by installing CCTVs accidents will just disappear. So what have we got to gain by having CCTVs now? Waiting for another accident to happen so we know what went wrong? Why can't we go ahead and implement other PREVENTIVE measures?</div>
