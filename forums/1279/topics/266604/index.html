You seldom get cockroaches with them. after SMRT came about, these were common. If TIBS is still around, you will most probably get a better service from them. There is a huge difference between these two companies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find that Nissans are just pioneer buses to me. Take the Scania N113CRB for example. It was quiet when it was just introduced into the SBS fleet, which is still full of Albions, Leylands and the Volvo B57s. Now, look at the bus. It's older and reaching retirement. You feel vibrations inside the buses that makes your head sick. Well, I'm proud that i'm born in the year where the Leyland Olympian OACs and the Nissan OACs were introduced. I think TIB369U is the most 'tuned' Nissan UD. It's engine is very loud and sounds like it's racing. Try to spot it on weekends on 178 or 187 or even on 981 AM peak. Well, I'm pleased to annouced......<br><br>TIB370P<br><br>is the first Nissan to have skyliner adverts on the rear for Panadol. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
