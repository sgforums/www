It would definitely save a lot of fuel and time for the first bus that departs from Yishun as it has to travel a long way before it can start it's first trip @ Yishun. Putting it under partial AMDEP would help a lot on fuel saving.<br><br>5) Now this is what puzzles me most. Why are services that ends at Eunos, like Services 63, 94 and 154 under BRBP control? I find that between the distance between BRBP to Eunos and the distance between BNDEP to Eunos, BNDEP to Eunos is definitely shorter.<br><br>I hope that someone out there can help solve these mysteries which have been hogging me for quite a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>1. S39 was once under full amdep from Sept 04 to July 05. The problem when it was under amdep is that the BCs change shift at Tampines instead of Yishun. It causes alot of problems back then. I believe S39 under amdep was a temporary measure.<br><br>5. bndep is like bursting to full capacity by then. That's why Eunos was under brbp where it still has space after it transferred Bishan services to amdep.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">the 32 &gt;&gt; 11 crossover is another...<br><br>bus off service from Buona Vista, goes to Kallang to do 11. and after that, off service back to buona vista...<br><br>why not off service at Bedok instead.. nearer to kallang</div></blockquote>The 32/11 xover bus goes off service from bedok to kallang, then Kallang to arbp. Applies both 11am and 7pm xover timings daily.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^tamago^:</div><div class="quote_body">2) Full Bt Batok Depot, Bt Merah RG service. Same thing. Soon Lee Bus Park probably already has its hands full, and Bt Batok Depot is right in the middle of two ends of this route. Why not?<br><br>3) Service 160 is a JB service. All JB service are under Bt Batok Depot.<br><br>4) Not only Service 197, many services at Bedok are controlled by Hougang Depot due to historical reasons. Some of them terminated at other termini which were under Hougang Depot control. Service 197 once terminated at Geylang (Lor 1) Terminal which is under Hougang Depot.</div></blockquote>2. Im more inclined to think that arbp has no more space for S198 that's why its under bbdep.<br><br>3. Then how about S506? the logic is missing somewhere..<br><br>4. Service 9 as well (Geylang Lor 1 - CACC)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Oceane:</div><div class="quote_body">I have 1 more question (which I forgot to post just now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )...<br><br>6) Why services that start at St. Michael's Ter, some like 131 under BRBP while others like 21 and 186 under AMDEP? Historical reason also?</div></blockquote>6. S131 got transferred from amdep to brbp in July 2006 because amdep needed space to accommodate to its expanding fleet due to the B9s. In addition, brbp has enough space for S131 because some of its parking lots are empty due to TPY buses doing overnight parking at TPY since Feb 06.<br></div>

He did not want dual depot control. And i think it is due to jump-bus at Bukit Merah.<br><br>3) JB-Reg buses all park at BBDEP regardless of what service they are from, you may say Queen Street dhould be under AR or BR but its just some sort of thing they follow, anyway BB has too much space, it used to park all the CCk, Bt Batok, Clementi service and some AR buses. So it would be wise to park there. It is also due to SL not having Mark IIIs. Express 506 too because of the buses it has (Striders).<br><br>4) BN already not much space left la bro. Why all your questions on wasting fuel? You cant have all buses taking the shortest route possible and btw HG isnt that far from BN. And i think i prefer it that way, do you wanna see N113s on 197, it would be a disgrace. Then agagin if it had B10TLs, it would look cool. Main reason because of lack of space at BN.<br><br>5) BN already NO SPACE LA. HG eunos --&gt; serangoon, BR bishan --&gt; eunos, AM serangoon --&gt; bishan</div>

Similary, K230UB, is a low floor city bus having a 230hp vertically mounted engine. This is only applicable for the 5th series Scanias.<br><br>2. Asking the obvious.
