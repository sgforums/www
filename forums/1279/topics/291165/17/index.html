As long as it leaves Sixth Ave towards Sengkang later than 6.50am, then it will hit the massive jam at Bukit Timah road due to Nanyang Girls, Hwa Chong Institution, Raffles Girls Primary School National Junior College and Nanyang Primary. Near Nanyang Girls, a lot of students going to RGS will get on. Then after it slowly crawls past Adam road, then it would be SCGS that cause another massive jam. After reaching the bus stop pass Raffles town club, the RGS girls get off, and then a whole lot of people going to RJC gets on. Then at RJC everyone gets off, and then when you reach Bishan, there will be RI jam to deal with. So an hour could easily be added to the usual journey time.

Frequency can hit as long as 20 minutes a bus during off-peak hours (PM) and even peak hours (PM) around the 6 plus timing in the direction of Sengkang to Clementi.  I have raised my concerns with SBST but as usual they said the frequency is adequate.</div>

If they feel that it is sufficient to cater to the demand, they won't do anything about it. I tried a few times before, but have since given up on that idea already. I have resigned to the fact that the demand is just not there to justify increasing the frequency. I sure miss those days when the max waiting time was 15mins.</div>

E.g. From Nanyang Girls to Raffles Town Club, and from RJC to J8. So it really is not feasible to put DD. Also, I understand that for evening peak, there are 2 down routes from Raffles Town Club. How low can demand be? I have taken empty buses, meaning I am the only passenger on the bus, from Clementi to Sixth Ave a few times.</div>
