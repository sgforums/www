The rest had the usual fleet. Thanks to the usual fleet the 1st and 2nd buses could not be back in time for the 2.15am and 2.50am trip, except 4N amazingly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>You are seriously out of your mind if you believe that 300 SMRT buses were deployed on NRs last night, though I admit the frequency was good last night.<br><br>Why SBST didnt deploy additional buses is because the demand was justified until proven. In addition, NRs proved to be more popular because they were around for a longer period. Furthermore, NRs catchment is greater than the Owls.</div>
