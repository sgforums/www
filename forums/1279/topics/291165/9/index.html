I'm more likely inclined to think of 198 as partial SLBP and partial ARBP.<br><br>3) Why is Service 160 fully BBDEP when it starts trips from Jurong East which is more of SLBP side?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Oceane:</div><div class="quote_body">1) Should 39 &amp; 85 be partial AMDEP? It would definitely save a lot of fuel and time for the first bus that departs from Yishun as it has to travel a long way before it can start it's first trip @ Yishun. Putting it under partial AMDEP would help a lot on fuel saving.<br><br>2) Why is Service 198 fully BBDEP when it goes between BNL and BT Merah? I'm more likely inclined to think of 198 as partial SLBP and partial ARBP.<br><br>3) Why is Service 160 fully BBDEP when it starts trips from Jurong East which is more of SLBP side? Or is it that Jurong East is closer to BBDEP than SLBP? Anyway, there goes my hopes of seeing JB registered SBST O405.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>4) Why is Service 197 partial HGDEP when it ends at Bedok, which is more of BNDEP side? The extra fuel wasted for buses to travel to Bedok from HGDEP than BNDEP is really a waste.<br><br>5) Now this is what puzzles me most. Why are services that ends at Eunos, like Services 63, 94 and 154 under BRBP control? I find that between the distance between BRBP to Eunos and the distance between BNDEP to Eunos, BNDEP to Eunos is definitely shorter.<br><br>I hope that someone out there can help solve these mysteries which have been hogging me for quite a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>1) Same thing with Service 961 and 985. These changes take time. Service 39 was once under Ang Mo Kio Depot but probably such savings were not huge as many duties ended at the wrong side of the route. Service 85 and 100 is to be fully under Hougang Depot as it has the space to accomodate it as compared with Ang Mo Kio Depot which has many other services to attend to as well.<br><br>2) Full Bt Batok Depot, Bt Merah RG service. Same thing. Soon Lee Bus Park probably already has its hands full, and Bt Batok Depot is right in the middle of two ends of this route. Why not?<br><br>3) Service 160 is a JB service. All JB service are under Bt Batok Depot.<br><br>4) Not only Service 197, many services at Bedok are controlled by Hougang Depot due to historical reasons. Some of them terminated at other termini which were under Hougang Depot control. Service 197 once terminated at Geylang (Lor 1) Terminal which is under Hougang Depot.<br><br>5) Serangoon Int was under Ang Mo Kio Depot and Eunos Int under Hougang Depot. However, in order to allow Hougang Depot to have better coordination with NEL on all bus interchanges/terminals associated with NEL, Serangoon Int was passed to Hougang Depot. Since Hougang Depot has to exchange another service over to Ang Mo Kio Depot or Braddell Bus Park, Eunos was chosen as the nearest candidate for this transfer. It is not all about fuel saving. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
