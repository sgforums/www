              <p>I agree with you. HGDEP could minority control 170? Then why SBS 8204C did not transferred to BBDEP when HGDEP can transferred SBS 8204C to BBDEP overnight?</p>

              <p>It comes back to the same logic: they probably thought initially it was wise to put new DM3500s to replace the outgoing DM3500s, until some wise people up there planning all this all of a sudden come across the greater benefits of lesser admin work in the long-term if they just swap to KUBs once &amp; for all..</p>
              <p>Idk, it seems more like they had a sudden abrupt change of plans. And what to do with those DM3500s that had kope-d from the East District depots? Distribute among themselves within the West District lo. Just nice HGDEP needs extra SP SDs to replace those new currently-SP Citaros (which are going to in turn replace the outgoing Striders). And that's why they just threw those DM3500s over. </p>

              <p>If that's the case SBST should have directly replaced all the JB

              registering the DM3500s with JB and making rectangular side destos
              for 160/170 had gone down the drain if 160/170 is to get full fleet

              <p>I think you missed out the point you raised in your post. Think about it, they could have used the Mk4 DMs &amp; Striders to replace the outgoing JB Mk3s back then, but yet they picked from the later-registered DM3500 batch instead. And for the handful of Striders that were touched for JB, they are the last few of the Striders. <br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It's quite an obvious reason why they picked the last few Striders reg-ed and not those Mk4 DMs or 19xx-series Striders - the lifespan expiry dates.<br><br>And then if you take a step back, back then when they decided to use DM3500s to replace the JB Mk3s, there was only a limited number of Citaros. The KUBs formed the bulk of their SD WAB fleet. The thought process for the JB fleet renewal is definitely not a one-month exercise, they probably planned for ages and didn't foresee that 160 &amp; 170 would go WAB anytime soon.</span></p>
              <p>So what to do then if that's the case? Pluck the newest non-WAB SDs then, which is the DM3500s &amp; the last few Striders.</p>
              <p>Then now with the first few DM3500s due to be gone soon within the next 2-3 years even with max extension, they can only pluck from the next set of newest buses, which is the KUBs. And it becomes inevitable that 160 &amp; 170 will go WAB-status soon.</p>

              <p>And did anyone forget that someone posted a pic of a KUB parked in JB Larkin Ter back then when the first few DM3500s went onto JB svc? <br>The number of years from then till now probably allowed the higher-ups to evaluate fully the possibility of using KUBs for cross-border svcs. And if the measure allowed them to buy time, along with all the admin &amp; prep work like 3rd brake lights, info box stixs, JB speed limit stixs etc for the KUBs, I wouldn't say that was a wasted measure.</p>
              <p>And I do think that the gearbox of the Euro IVs would suit the cross-border svcs better at the moment, because the kickdown is much easier to achieve in a Euro IV KUB than a Euro V..</p>

              <p>It comes back to the same logic: they probably thought initially
              it was wise to put new DM3500s to replace the outgoing DM3500s,
              until some wise people up there planning all this all of a sudden
              come across the greater benefits of lesser admin work in the
              long-term if they just swap to KUBs once &amp; for all..</p>
              <p>Idk, it seems more like they had a sudden abrupt change of
              plans. And what to do with those DM3500s that had kope-d from the
              East District depots? Distribute among themselves within the West
              District lo. Just nice HGDEP needs extra SP SDs to replace those
              new currently-SP Citaros (which are going to in turn replace the
              outgoing Striders). And that's why they just threw those DM3500s
              over. </p>

              <p>i agree on what u say. initially i was wondering also why they want to replace later DM3500s to older DM3500s when they can just use KUB batch 1 to replace instead.</p>

              <p>I don't think it has much to do with carrying people more safely. A wholly-loaded KUB in my opinion is more dangerous than a fully-packed Mk4. Esp when they try their best to pick up speed with a full load of pax.</p>

                  Where did you get the idea that JB lacks CNG refuelling facilities? There are a few in JB itself, there are a couple of those near Larkin. But in any case, it is illogical to have a small fleet of oddballs running these routes, as it will cause operational issues.
