              <p>I have to agree that the Bode doors are the best. </p>
              <p>Reasons:</p>
              <p>1. SMC doors are either very loose or only just sturdy enough, not to mention the terrible quality of the doors! You can have the doors not closing fully or even bang the rubber like going to smash and break!</p>
              <p>2. Deans doors tend to be violent, but the doors still have a better seal than the SMC doors. In fact, the doors usually have a better quality than the SMC doors!</p>
              <p>3. Masats doors are okay, but feel quite cheap for European doors... Front door flaps easily spoilt and the rear door cover looks like it can just fall off. Only the rear doors are durable, in my opinion...</p>
              <p>Ventura doors should be as good as Bode doors, hopefully. Only thing I don't like about the Bode doors on the Citaros is that the front doors would swing when closing... Otherwise, both the front and rear doors on the Citaros are just about the best for modern buses. Even the Bode-Masats doors on the O405s are still as durable as they are supposed to be.</p>

              <p>I feel that the Euro V KUBs have looser (rear) doors than the Euro IV KUBs... It is very hard to find a Euro V KUB with sturdy doors. Then again, the Euro IV KUBs can also have very loose doors...</p>
              <p>Some KUBs I have taken with sturdy doors:</p>
              <p>SBS5176U (BNDEP 36) - very hard to find a Euro V with sturdy doors...</p>
              <p>SBS8169X (BNDEP 36)</p>
              <p>SBS8309J (HGDEP 156) - best of the pack in my opinion...</p>
              <p>Anyway, the Batch 3 WEGs have a newer door system, which shakes very little. I wonder how it is sturdier than the older shaky stuff... </p>

              <p>slight correction - Masats was a SUBSIDARY of Bode, formerly known as Bode-Masats before Masats was divested in the early 2000s. this will explain why some of the 405G doors have both the BOde and Masats logo on the door glass panel. </p>

              <p>im biased to Masats cos they seem unsually "rock sturdy" on the 405Gs, NUS KUBs and A22s. wont comment much on the other doors, altho the performance of the SMC transit doors have left me wondering if the curvature of the GML bodies on the (taller) KUBs/OCs have an effect on the performance on the doors. the SMC doors on the B9TLs seem to function fairly well with little/no issues. note that the SMC doors on all the B9s are not bent. </p>

              <p>the slanting of the door poles is actually an "optical illusion" of sorts as the door poles are perpendicular wrt the bus floor like a "|" whilst the doors are actually bent inwards, much like a "/". i was thinking that the height of the doors poses an extra issue as the OC and KUBs use taller SMC doors compared to the B9s (CDGE/WEG2), and somehow somewhat something just seems to ensure that the doors dont close tightly or resoundingly enough on the KUBs/OCs.... </p>
              <p>interesting that the SMC doors on the WEGs have to be more tightly screwed than usual, but again it may not come as a surprise as all SMC doors on the CDGE/WEG2s have a "spacer plate" between the door pole and the doors. wont wanna pin down any particular reason, but it may lie in how the door pole  is "curved" (such that its still able to effectively close/open the door) that leads to the requirement of these "spacer plates". note that the OCs/KUBs dont have such spacer plates for their rear swong doors.  </p>
