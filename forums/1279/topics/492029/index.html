                 <p>I wonder if this is to instigate Tower Transit and Go Ahead to increase their salaries to match or surpass SBS Transit salary, as from the looks of it, these two bus companies want to offer the best employment package for bus drivers.</p>
                              
                              <p>Whereas for SMRT, I guess they will do something similar soon. They are probably waiting to see if Go Ahead or Tower Transit will respond by increasing their salaries, before they increase their own salary to at least match the lowest one. #justsaying</p>

              <p>Come on. This is common sense. We all work for money. Who would
              not want to work at a company that pays higher salary?</p>
              <p>of course, vacancies are limited. It's not that if want then
              confirm will have. but my concern is about the SBS Transit drivers
              affected by GCM who are going to the new operators. Now that SBS
              increase their salary, I do not think they still want to go work
              for the new operators.... especially when the government already
              say that SBS and SMRT must help their affected staff get job if
              they stay on.</p>
              <p>I'm worried for Tower Transit and Go Ahead, especially Tower
              Transit as they are taking over some SBS Transit routes on next
              Sunday. If those SBS Transit drivers who are going to Tower Transit
              now decide to stay on at SBS Transit, would Tower Transit still
              have enough drivers to deliver their new bus services next
              sunday?</p>

              <p>Come on. This is common sense. We all work for money. Who would
                  not want to work at a company that pays higher salary?</p>
              <p>of course, vacancies are limited. It's not that if want then
                  confirm will have.</p>
              <p>my concern is about the SBS Transit drivers affected by GCM who
                  are going to the new operators. Now that SBS increase their salary,
                  I do not think they still want to go work for the new operators....
                  especially when the government already say that SBS and SMRT must
                  help their affected staff get job if they stay on.</p>
              <p>I'm worried for Tower Transit and Go Ahead, especially Tower
                  Transit as they are taking over some SBS Transit routes on next
                  Sunday. If those SBS Transit drivers who are going to Tower Transit
                  now decide to stay on at SBS Transit, would Tower Transit still
                  have enough drivers to deliver their new bus services next
                  sunday?</p>
              <p>Really, the timing is bad. They should have announced it at a
                  later date. :(</p>
              <p>Is SBS Transit really short of workers? Why are they ramping up
                  on their hiring of bus drivers? :( If it's just to increase
                  competition, then they should not have done it now. A better time
                  would be around September after Go-Ahead also begin operating all
                  their bus routes.</p>

              <p>You must remember those ex SBST BCs which got bad experience with them,Surely they dont want to join back right?Anyway SBST didnt offer $2500 basic pay mah..They rather join TT or GA.Another thing to take note,Higher basic pay doesnt mean they dont cut the OT hours leh,If they get enough pool of BCs to play around definately the OT will be reduce.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, running bus services is a loss-making business and running train services makes little profit. SBS Transit's and SMRT's profits are largely from their advertising and rental businesses.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>When the market is bad, companies would cut costs to survive, and one way is to reduce expenditure on advertising and scale down businesses. When that happens, bus companies would collect less revenue from their advertising and rental businesses.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>If less revenue is collected from advertising and rental, bus companies would make less profit, or even incur loss. To make more profit, or change loss to proft, an obvious way is to lower the salary (reduce costs).</p>
                                      
                                      <p>As such, I feel that the bus companies are not able to keep paying the higher salaries while the economy turns bad.</p>
                              
                              <p>Although bus companies' core business of running bus services' demand is not affected by business cycle and stuff, their other businesses are affected, and it is the other businesses that help the bus companies generate profit. So, the economy performance does affect the bus companies.</p>

              <p>Yes, salaries can drop in the long run. But that's a very long way to go.</p>
              <p>Again, look to what happened at Transperth buses for an answer. This was when Path Transit (now part of Kelios Downer) lost to TT Perth and Transdev Perth:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/path-transit-has-lost-two-of-its-thee-major-bus-contracts/story-e6frg2s3-1225955854194">http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/path-transit-has-lost-two-of-its-thee-major-bus-contracts/story-e6frg2s3-1225955854194</a></p>
              <p>But the more likely outcome is the operator goes bankrupt outright:</p>
