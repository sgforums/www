I think most likely an intergration with another route is more like it or change of route is more likely .<br><br>That will be interesting when NE line starts .</div>

If this service is withdrawn, I think Gr8 World City will suffer a loss! Also, this is the only svc that passes thru Tiong Bahru, with the ignorance of Tiong Bahru MRT Stn. My view is if this service is withdrawn, there wouldn't be a direct svc to Tiong Bahru from Upp Serangoon Rd. I hope that the svc would either remain, or to be integrated with other svc.<br><br>I think at most the route of service 85 will stay the same, be amended, integrate with other services but not withdrawn.<br></div></blockquote></div>
