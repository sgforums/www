This is the article:<br><br>PRESS RELEASE<br>For immediate release<br><br>25 Jul 99<br><br>SBS TAKES OVER BUS OPERATIONS IN SENGKANG<br><br>From today, SBS takes over from Tibs the operation of Services 864, 865 and 866 in Sengkang.  The takeover of Sengkang services will enable SBS to provide an integrated and seamless bus and rail service along the northeast corridor.  SBS will be a multi-modal public transport operator when the NorthEast MRT and Sengkang LRT start operation in 2002, followed by Punggol LRT 2 years later.<br><br>This will involve SBS taking over the bus services in Sengkang and Punggol in exchange for our services in Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok.  Under Phase 1 implemented today, SBS gives up Service 190 in Choa Chu Kang.<br><br>MPs for Cheng San GRC, Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Punggol Central) and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Punggol East) joined residents and grassroots representatives in Sengkang town this morning in a ceremony to mark the takeover of Sengkang bus services by SBS.<br><br>In his speech, Dr Michael Lim said that Sengkang residents can look forward to a yet higher level of public transport service as the integration would cover routes, fares, information and facilities.  He added, Â“There will be better integration of timings, schedules and routes to further enhance the service level of residents in the NorthEast corridor.Â”<br><br>To mark the takeover of Sengkang services, residents are given a complimentary ride on any of the 3 services today.  The first 500 residents who turned up at the ceremony also received a farecard from SBS.<br><br>Immediate service improvements by SBS in Sengkang Â…..<br><br>Â·More than 30 double deck Superbuses are deployed on Services 864, 865 and 88 to immediately increase the capacity and provide a higher level of comfort for Sengkang residents.<br><br>Â·Starting today, Sengkang residents get a new service.  The extension of Service 27 to Sengkang provides residents with new links to Tampines and Changi Airport.   Previously, Service 27 plied between Tampines and Changi Airport.<br><br>Improved service information Â…..<br><br>Â·Commuters of Services 864, 865 and 866 can now pick up a copy of service guide on board the buses.  These guides tell commuters all they need to know about the service.  It contains information on fares, route details, operating hours, frequency and major landmarks along the route.  Service guides are already available on all regular SBS trunk services and at interchanges.<br><br>Â·Service information boards will be strategically placed at 4 locations around Sengkang.  Besides displaying route and fare information, we have included an additional feature, a Sengkang Town map, to facilitate travel in Sengkang.  Major landmarks like schools, playhouse, community centre and place of worship are clearly shown on the map.<br><br>SBS President, Mr Phua Tin How on future bus plansÂ…..<br><br>Said SBS President, Mr Phua Tin How,Â”SBS will increase the number of services and network coverage in Sengkang in tandem with the growth of the town.  We have added one more service today and have plans to introduce three more services by the end of this year, and another four services by end 2000.  These services will provide new links to the other housing estates and major centres of activities.Â”<br><br>Service 864 plies between Sengkang and Marina Centre via Upper Serangoon Road.<br>Service 865 plies between Sengkang and World Trade Centre via Orchard Road.<br>Service 866 plies between Sengkang and Ang Mo Kio via Jalan Kayu.<br><br>_______________________________________________________________________<br>Issued by Singapore Bus Services Limited<br><br>Contact person:<br><br>Mrs Cheng Lay Tin, Vice President			Tel: 383 7201<br>Corporate Communications<br><br>Mr Loo Ing Heng, Manager					Tel: 383 7202<br>Corporate Communications<br><br>===================================</div>
