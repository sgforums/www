            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Singapore Buses Forum Members<br><br>Firstly, thank you to all the candidates who applied for the post of moderator in our Singapore Buses forums.<br><br>As at the end of the day, the moderators will be serving our community, I would like for the community to be able to get involved in this selection process. To this end, I have opened this thread to give every member an opportunity to give feedback and also to have a Q&amp;A session with the prospective candidates. Although this is not an election, the sgForums Inner Circle will definitely take on board, where appropriate, as much feedback from you as possible. It is also a chance for you to question and get to know your prospective future moderators.<br><br>Please avoid posting messages which do not contribute to this aim! (I know its hard but try lahÂ…) Also, if there is any feedback you would like to give in private, please feel free to PM me.<br><br>The following posts will contain messages from each of the candidates introducing themselvesÂ…<br><br>---<br><br>More info:<br><br>There are 3 moderator positions open but depending on how things go we might only fill 1 or 2 of them after these selections.<br><br>We hope to make a decision by middle October.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tintinspartan<br><br>Hi, my name is Afiq Marzuqi Azman and i'm 14 years old. I live in the Marsiling Area and is studying at Sembawang Secondary School. I would like to become a moderator here as it lets me introduce new bus enthusiasts to the forum and I want to obtain a sense of law and order here. I visit this forum regulary and would always want to share my bus knowledge at the same time.<br><br>--------<br><br>SBS9816E<br><br>This is SBS9816E (Jack). I have been in this forum since the start of the forum. I used to be one of the moderators of this forum, but got taken out as I did not have the time then to manage the whole. Upon looking at the state of the forum, there is nothing constructive being discussed, and it is not being held up as the name of the forum. Trivial issues have been discussed, and they are never come to a point that are of something constructive. I would plead you to add me as part of the moderator team, so that I could bring this forum back to its old days of having good stuffs to be discussed. Also, I want to maintain the forum in tip top condition, so as to uphold the image, and to provide fair judgement for members of the forum.<br><br>--------<br><br>BusSpeeder<br><br>I'm BusSpeeder and I'm from the centre part of Singapore. I'm interested in this position because I'm always active and mostly come to the bus forum to check stuffs and to post bus stuffs- cameos of buses/redeployment of buses and more. I should be chosen because I'm usually active throughout the day and i can close unnecessary threads, those spam threads or stuffs unrelated to buses. I'm also doing other stuffs, surfing here at the same time.<br><br>I hope you will consider my application.<br><br>--------<br><br>muziq bus<br>My name is Adam aka muziq bus in Sgbuses.<br>I am a media student and a bus enthusiast<br>I have been involved in sgbuses since 2005 and have been stuck there ever since.<br>It is obvious that my interests are buses, buses and more buses.<br>I am also the mod for SgTrains.<br><br>So i thought i might try my luck in becoming a mod and maintain peace in the forum<br><br>--------<br><br>ZYX2005<br><br>hi folks. This is ZYX2005. I prefer to know you guys by actual name.<br>Name: Zhan Yanxin<br>origins: Singapore. actually from the bus enthusiast community. joined the yahoo group. got to know many bus enthusiasts.<br><br>Actually i Was one of the peeps who rooted for the idea of a bus forum. Then Charles, Ishak and me chatted about it and Charles then applied to start a forum here. I left my post as moderator much later because I felt the forum was going haywire with crazy flaming posts and all those flame wars.<br><br>interest in post: Forum certainly has grown. I would like to come back to moderate the bus forum and make the place better for all to post in. Also will like to promote more interesting topics to discuss on to make the forum much more lively. My idea is to mirror the current more established forum in S8 invisionfree of which i am also a moderator.<br><br>Given the situation that our dear businfohub (which i am also a web-administrator<br>there) is ummm down with server problems, this forum can take over its place and have similair discussion threads while we try to fix the server problems there.<br><br>Incidentally i wish to nominate our dear Charles to come back and run his forum he started.<br><br>yanxin<br>aka ZYX<br><br>--------<br><br>jetabt767400<br><br>Hi, I am a frequent user of the above stated forum. I find that except for the fact that its very chaotic to find information there due to the frequent spamming and argument of threads, some users there are inclined on creating trouble and as such, many offensive/duplicating threads have went up and things like 'traditions' were being said again and again without being implemented.<br><br>As a forumnite, I feel saddened by such a thing. And also as responsible user well, since I have the time after school and even during school hours, I am interested in taking the forum up as a moderator and monitor the activities there. I would gladly accept if I can be given full control of the forum (ie. not public anymore).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>^tamago^<br><br>Hi I am Alan. I was part of the team managing the buses forum in 2004 until it was dissolved later. During the period I helped to introduce Newcomers Guide and also participate in discussions, and I would like to have another go at restoring some order and provide a conducive environment for discussions to go on.<br><br>--------<br><br>Zilchster<br><br>About myself:<br><br>I am Darren, 26 year old chinese guy from Singapore. The reason why I am applying for moderator is not because I am power hungry or wanting play God or whatever. I am doing it as a small contribution to bus community of Singapore or to those forumnites who patronise this forums anyway. Basically there are quite a number of 'useless' threads in the Buses forums have been started unnecessarily which need to be cleaned up which I hope to do that so as to give other people a better experience in viewing the forums. I also possess an interest in buses, although I may not be so passionate about it as some of the others, but I believe that it will not hinder me from doing the job as a mod. I would try my best to be level-headed and to be impartial and not take sides. At the same time, I hope to protect some of the interests of the bus community in certain issues. This is why I am applying for the post.<br><br>I may have been a little autocratic in the past in dealing with certain people in the forum, but I believe that my actions were justified as these certain people had been rather disruptive at times. However, I decided that being autocratic does not solve problems. As a matured adult, and havingbeen a facilitator of a singer's fan club, I think I have some leadership qualities. I believe that I do not need to resort to impose a Hitler style rule on the forum. I believe in democracy, and trying to point out errors in private as far as possible. I believe that I would be able to keep my cool, and an impartial mind moderating this forums, and let everyone enjoy their time here, but at the same time try to uphold peace in the forums.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Darren<br><br>--------<br><br>kenn3th<br><br>Before i introduce myself, i would like to confess that i may not be as qualified as compared to other bus fans which know almost every single thing about the buses in singapore.<br><br>Ok, about me, I am kenneth, a member in sgforum yep.<br>Why am i interested in the being the moderator of this forum, is that i would wish to repay my gratitude to the forum, by stretching out my hands to help and assist people who maybe in need of directions to a place ect. Next, not to call myself ambitious or whatever so, i would wish to further improve my moderating skills, and how to cope with difficult situations. I have confidence that i would do a great job in manning the forums. My Current Objective if i were to get selected is to enforce certain rules that might help ease confusion in the bus forum itself, like there's now 3 threads of the same name titled "Anything unusual on the roads (Jul 2007 to Sep 2007)" So i would wish to tackle this issue. My next objective is to change the mindset of the people, that buses forum does not = bus nerds talking about buses. Yes it is difficult, but if aunt agony is able to do it, why can't i ?<br><br>Why would you like to choose me?<br>- first, i currently man a few forums, with ncc forum being my main forum.<br>-second, it's a never ending learning journey to moderating, and i would wish to gain more knowledge in public relations<br><br>outside sgforums, i m an admin of aseanlegion, a clan, for a game in rappelz<br><br>so therefore, i would wish you would select me (:<br><br>*kenn<br><br>--------<br><br>Raraken<br><br>I am Raraken, or Ahmad Syakir. I am from Sembawang, specifically Sembawang Drive. I am interested in the post of moderator because whenever I see a very useless topic, I felt a desire to close and ban it,as it takes too much bandwidth. I think you should choose me as I am good at recognising useless or silly bandwidth-eating topics.</div>
