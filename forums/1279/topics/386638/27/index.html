              <p><strong>Maid dies saving baby girl</strong></p>
              <p>SHE loved them so much that she was even willing to lay her life down
               for the girls. On Saturday night, Indonesian maid Puji Astutik died 
              proving her love - and saved her boss' one-year-old.</p>
              <p>Ms Puji, 28, was crossing the road with her employer, Mrs Lam's 
              younger daughter, when an SMRT bus ran into her at the junction of Choa 
              Chu Kang Street 52 and Choa Chu Kang North 6.</p>
              <p>She flung the baby girl forward but was pinned under the 
              wheels, The New Paper and Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao reported.</p>
              <p>She was rushed to the National University Hospital, but died
               later that night from her injuries. The Lams' daughter suffered minor 
              scratches on her left arm and kept shivering that night.</p>
              <p>Neighbours remember Ms Puji as a 'very friendly' person who 
              would say hi. Mrs Lam said she intended to renew the maid's contract 
              when it expired in September.</p>

              <p>SHE loved them so much that she was even willing to lay her life
              down for the girls. On Saturday night, Indonesian maid Puji Astutik
              died proving her love - and saved her boss' one-year-old.</p>
              <p>Ms Puji, 28, was crossing the road with her employer, Mrs Lam's
              younger daughter, when an SMRT bus ran into her at the junction of
              Choa Chu Kang Street 52 and Choa Chu Kang North 6.</p>
              <p>She flung the baby girl forward but was pinned under the wheels,
              The New Paper and Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao reported.</p>
              <p>She was rushed to the National University Hospital, but died
              later that night from her injuries. The Lams' daughter suffered
              minor scratches on her left arm and kept shivering that night.</p>
              <p>Neighbours remember Ms Puji as a 'very friendly' person who
              would say hi. Mrs Lam said she intended to renew the maid's
              contract when it expired in September.</p>

              <p>OMG condolences to the maid.. I saw the incident too while taking SMB5Y on 307 with my mum at night. The bus (MY FAV 992U!) stopped in an awkward position turning left at the junction. Police came and strapped the blue strip around the bus together with the nearby block.</p>
