              <p><strong>YOG bus involved in chain collision accident along PIE</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #262c2c;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Times,serif;">According
               to a tip-off we received from a reader, a YOG bus was involved in a 
              multi-vehicle accident on the Pan Island Expressway in the direction of 
              Tuas two hours ago, causing a massive jam along the PIE.<br> The 
              YOG bus was apparently empty and nobody was reported to be injured. Some
               motorists were heard hurling profanities at the scene.<br> YOG 
              drivers have received much flak from the public lately over their 
              driving behavior such as tailgating, honing for vehicles in front to 
              make way and cutting into others’ lanes dangerously without giving any 
              signals.<br> It is 
              not known how the accident occurred. In its attempt to ensure that YOG 
              vehicles get to their venues on time, the PAP regime passed a law 
              requiring motorists to give way to YOG vehicles in YOG-designated lanes 
              or risked being fined $130 which is not quite well received by 
              Singaporeans.</span></span></span></p>
