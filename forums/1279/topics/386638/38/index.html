              <p>so now you're blaming the accidents on unluckiness? Accidents because who's unlucky? The drivers? The mechanics? The staff in SLBP?</p>
              <p>Accidents are caused by the sheer lapse of concentration by either or both party, or whoever involved. Let's go through each accident one by one.</p>
              <p>1. SBS2786D crashing into the bus stop. The bus' brakes failed due to unluckiness? I don't think so. Although there is a chance that no signs were shown to the mechanics that there's a chance that the brakes might be faulty, means blame this on luck? So who's going to offer compensation to the injured and apologize? Claim from luck because luck caused it?</p>
              <p>2. LO and KUB crashed into each other. Looking at the condition, cannot be brakes fail. Either the driver of the LO didn't slow down enough when entering the bus bay, or the driver of the KUB stopped the bus suddenly and the LO cannot react fast enough. So the blame is on either of the driver, or both. Don't talk to me about poor visibility or oil on the road. With conditions like this, shouldnt the driver be driving even slower and at a safer distance behind vehicles?</p>
              <p>So blame it on luck? I think not..</p>

              <p>Service: 105</p>

              <p>Date: 16/05/2010</p>
              <p>Was onboard SBS2692R, which is the next bus. When it stopped at the traffic light, it opened the front door and pax came in. Amazingly, no one was standing up! With 8488A's pax, there is only 2 seats left...</p>
              <p>Seriously, <strong>SLBP</strong> is giving crap maintainence to it's buses. Is this why they won the best district award in 2009? Best district? My foot! I pity <strong>BBDEP/ARBP/HGDEP</strong> alot for being part of West district.</p>

              <p>You won't be able to convince people by coming out, saying it's not due to sth sth and then stopping there. You say it's not due to mechanical failure, then what exactly happened? Is it really classified under top secret that you cannot come out with the reason what happened after saying it's not due to sth?</p>

              <p>Do be mindful that this is a public forum and anyone and everyone have access to this forums if they have internet access from anywhere around this universe.</p>
              <p>In general company staff are to sign a non-disclosure form when they sign their employment letter with the company that they are not allowed to disclose any confidential information that would conform the Securities and Futures Act as any non-publicly available information may alter the share price of the company. This is especially so if it is a publicly listed company. That is why there are company spokespersons for any media/press conference and that person giving the news is deemed as the official source of anything coming from the company. Anyone else saying anything is deemed as non-official - but what they say may or may not be true so you have to take it in and analyse the information they provide by yourself.</p>
              <p>The logic applies when you enlist for NS. You also have to sign a non-disclosure form when that happens. This means if you come across any information or material during the course of your 2 years in the SAF, you are not allowed to disclose them to the general public as any information leaked out may jeopardise the security and safety of our country. You may engage in casual chat with your fellow camp/platoon mates regarding the issue since you both are involved in the exercise or came across the information at the same time. You imagine while serving the nation you tell some overseas soldier during exercise the upcoming operations that you are involved in.. what's the plan like.. and the formation etc? The overseas soldier may go back and tell their own people and from there understand how our SAF works.</p>
              <p>Exbbman is doing us a favour by finding out reasons behind the recent accidents. It is to our benefit that we know them. So you either take it, or leave it. If you take it in, analyse what could be the other causes of the accident and not just ask back for the actual reason. Its as good as spoonfeeding. I would suggest if you want to know how accidents or fires occur, go learn the technical aspects of the hobby. The engineering behind how a bus works would work to your advantage in finding out causes of accidents like these.</p>
              <p>Thankfully Exbbman (i hope i get this right) is not a company staff otherwise if someone wants to sabotage him by telling his superior he leaked out company information, he can be liable for dismissal from the company if it is investigated into. I am sure none of you want that to happen.</p>
