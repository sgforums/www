              <p>I don't understand what's with him being so over protective of any personnel in his depot. He keeps saying they're innocent but it's him who makes them look guilty because he himself has no conscience of the words he choose, the viewpoints he makes, and the behaviour and attitude he carries himself. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I'd vouch anytime that SLBP personnel are likely to be innocent, but it's because of his big mouth, nonsense and tiny brains that make an innocent person look seemingly guilty. If he shuts his damn mouth up probably such biasness wouldn't have escalated.</p>
              <p>He's trying to say that DD drivers only care about the things in front and does not need to bother about the things happening on top? Like that ah. 174 convert full SD fleet lor. Frequency put as usual. Any complains direct it to Mr. chickenlittle2. Makes travelling safer for us anyway. Imagine chickenlittle drives 174 DD. I'll never want to take.</p>
              <p>NEA is probably at fault for not pruning the tree, but the driver needs to shoulder some responsibility for the accident as well. You can't tell me that the driver has got nothing to do with the top of the bus being sliced off when the top deck and the lower deck are joined together as ONE "SBS7499A" operated by ONE driver. Such senseless and irresponsible comments only come from our <em>almighty</em> chickenlittle2.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This accident from everyones view is purely an accident. I know many ppl here thinks that they are clever and like to be detective but you guys really need to see how big is the world outside. You need to be responsible of what you say. In this forum , you can say what you like and want, but when you are outside you will get urself into trouble.</p>
              <p>Even me myself got no exact details of what really happened. I believe if dangling branch were there, the driver should had saw it. But we can't rule out the possibility that If the branch just fall off danging there just 5 sec before that the bus approach, so how to predict?</p>

              <p>so now you're blaming the accidents on unluckiness? Accidents because who's unlucky? The drivers? The mechanics? The staff in SLBP?</p>
              <p>Accidents are caused by the sheer lapse of concentration by either or both party, or whoever involved. Let's go through each accident one by one.</p>
              <p>1. SBS2786D crashing into the bus stop. The bus' brakes failed due to unluckiness? I don't think so. Although there is a chance that no signs were shown to the mechanics that there's a chance that the brakes might be faulty, means blame this on luck? So who's going to offer compensation to the injured and apologize? Claim from luck because luck caused it?</p>
              <p>2. LO and KUB crashed into each other. Looking at the condition, cannot be brakes fail. Either the driver of the LO didn't slow down enough when entering the bus bay, or the driver of the KUB stopped the bus suddenly and the LO cannot react fast enough. So the blame is on either of the driver, or both. Don't talk to me about poor visibility or oil on the road. With conditions like this, shouldnt the driver be driving even slower and at a safer distance behind vehicles?</p>
              <p>So blame it on luck? I think not..</p>
