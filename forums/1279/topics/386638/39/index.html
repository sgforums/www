              <p>today at around 11+ am, a JB registered MK III got into an accident at Turf Club Ave/Woodlands Road/Kranji Road junction, with an Malaysia MPV, and a Lorry... The front part of the MK III is smashed...  Cant see the rego clearly but it look like SBS871 (not confirmed)... It should be on Sv 160 as spotted a rear desto over at BC Cabin side windows there... not sure what really happen, but the MK III seem to be travelling straight towards Kranji (from CCK) and the other two vehicles seem like to be turning into Kranji Road (from Kranji MRT direction).</p>
              <p><br>this junction is real dangerous. TIB997 also got into accident in the same junction and there are a few more serious accidents in the past month..</p>

              (Fri)</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>3:58pm - Bus was towed away.<br></strong><br> <strong>TIB587G on 966 (WLDEP 966)</strong> was hit from the back
              at the bus bay along Petir Road (Opp Blk 201) today at 3 plus by a
              Comfort Sonata Taxi.<br> <br> Believed TIB587G stopped to pick up commuters and the taxi behind
              was unable to brake on time, hence hitting its back.<br> <br> Full front of the taxi was destroyed, while left back of bus was
              hit most severly. Back left and centre was not hit. <br> <br> Unfortunately, when I wanted to take my camera out to take a
              picture, the tow truck had just towed away the bus.<br> <br> Bus's front engine cover was also removed. Not sure if it dropped
              during collision or what.</p>
