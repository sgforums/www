              <p>The second case i rmb. In fact it seems to be the deceased 7253 i rode on. The 154 macham overtake, brushed against the shrubs on the right side (the section outside adam food centre) and end up all the leaves whirl in like a typhoon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. I forgot if i sat on driver side but it was like an esso carwash movement with all the brushing.

              <p><br>The case is rammed into outgrown branch, not branch dropped from above right? Cos if its a fallen branch i think it'll dent like a baseball bat hit on a spot, not like this state. Anyway, it looks very "scrapyard" from the warped roof and cui window frame.</p>
              <p>There's many sinister points to think of. Other than this bus "join the queue" at SLBP workshop, in probability sense there's no less than 25 VO3, 25 LO3 (based on the 74, 154, 157 and 174 perms) passing the road there, yet it hit 1/7 B9 that goes there, of which 4 of 151 are slackers on S shift.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, of all other DD, 7402 of 174 also had such experience. Thus, it's an ominous deja-vu.</p>

              <p>Ya, DD BCs are supposed to pay attention to low hanging branches and overhead hazards. That's why they are paid DD allowance.</p>
              <p>In the case of filmsy low hanging branches, it would have caused damage to the DD roof if it just happened during or after the rain.</p>
              <p>Though NPark might have a tree-prunning schedule, SBST as the operator of public transport especially with DD should check the DD authorised routes for low hanging branches and overhead obstacles to ensure safe DD operations. This is more important during rainy seasons.</p>
              <p>In these cases, BCs of DDs should have reported to RG, District (Safety &amp; Garaging) and SBST (Safety &amp; Quality) to conduct their own height clearance on the afftected routes. If not, DD BC involved in such accident/incident is fully responsible.</p>

              <p>I don't understand what's with him being so over protective of any personnel in his depot. He keeps saying they're innocent but it's him who makes them look guilty because he himself has no conscience of the words he choose, the viewpoints he makes, and the behaviour and attitude he carries himself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I'd vouch anytime that SLBP personnel are likely to be innocent, but it's because of his big mouth, nonsense and tiny brains that make an innocent person look seemingly guilty. If he shuts his damn mouth up probably such biasness wouldn't have escalated.</p>
              <p>He's trying to say that DD drivers only care about the things in front and does not need to bother about the things happening on top? Like that ah. 174 convert full SD fleet lor. Frequency put as usual. Any complains direct it to Mr. chickenlittle2. Makes travelling safer for us anyway. Imagine chickenlittle drives 174 DD. I'll never want to take.</p>
              <p>NEA is probably at fault for not pruning the tree, but the driver needs to shoulder some responsibility for the accident as well. You can't tell me that the driver has got nothing to do with the top of the bus being sliced off when the top deck and the lower deck are joined together as ONE "SBS7499A" operated by ONE driver. Such senseless and irresponsible comments only come from our <em>almighty</em> chickenlittle2.</p>
