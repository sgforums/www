              <p>As I read the Stomp, I realised that the driver was spearheaded as the cause of the accident.</p>
              <p>No drivers, local or foreign, will put his life and passenger at risk.</p>
              <p>It is not logical.</p>
              <p>As accordance to the witness account, the driver DID try to stop the bus but the brake seem to have failed.</p>
              <p>So, it will be interesting on how the company conduct its investigation and the eventual result.</p>

              <p><br>We analyse that the situation was too sudden, and emergency stopping methods to turn off the engine or pull the handbrake is very dangerous. The driver himself might have panicked at the point of incident. I agree he could have change to N gear, but N gear could still keep the bus moving for a distance too.</p>

              <p><br> I am not saying the the BC is in fault. But that does not mean that
              it is SLWS problem and they had nt been maintaining
              the bus.</p>
              <p>By just reading the article, u will find a lot of loophole. The
              max speed for this bus is 60km/h, after it hits 3 cars shouldn't it
              should reduce the speed of the bus? If the BC were to shift to
              neutral, will it helps? Or it is possible to apply on/off on the
              handbrakes?</p>

              <p>what makes you think the bus smashed into the bus stop at 60kmh?</p>
              <p>mr ayam, do you even DRIVE? what makes you think the bus will come to a stop instantaneously after putting the gear into neutral? and if the brakes had failed, would the handbrake even be effective? the B10M braking system is driven by AIR, mind you, not disc brakes.</p>

              <p><br> We analyse that the situation was too sudden, and emergency
              stopping methods to turn off the engine or pull the handbrake is
              very dangerous. The driver himself might have panicked at the point
              of incident. I agree he could have change to N gear, but N gear
              could still keep the bus moving for a distance too.</p>
