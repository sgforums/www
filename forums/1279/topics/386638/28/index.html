              <p>yup, all these RTAs especially those fatal ones are sad especially if you were to witness it or handled those cases up close &amp; personal..</p>
              <p>anyway, once blood is dried it's quite difficult to remove; think the TP had already placed a sign there asking for witnesses..</p>

              <p>TIB997G involved in accident at Woodlands Road, junction with Turf Club Avenue and Kranji Road. spotted at 6.05pm, TP already arrived. the bus crashed into the traffic light, and a lamp post, and was parked in a weird manner, such that the bus is turning left. not much damages to the bus, suspected that a SilverCab Kia rammed into it. the window at the driver cabin seems to be sawn off, for the whole glass panel seems to be gone..</p>
