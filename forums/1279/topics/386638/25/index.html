              <p>mr ayam, do you even DRIVE? what makes you think the bus will come to a stop instantaneously after putting the gear into neutral? and if the brakes had failed, would the handbrake even be effective? the B10M braking system is driven by AIR, mind you, not disc brakes.</p>

              <p>By just reading the article, u will find a lot of loophole. The
              max speed for this bus is 60km/h, after it hits 3 cars shouldn't it
              should reduce the speed of the bus? If the BC were to shift to
              neutral, will it helps? Or it is possible to apply on/off on the
              handbrakes?</p>

              <p>how do you apply the handbrakes if something is indeed wrong with the brakes? i'm saying this for the 2nd time. the article mentioned that the BC wasn't able to stop the bus. it can be the case that the brakes of the bus had either malfunction or failed. you said the max speed of the bus is 60 km/h but how are we able to
              determine the speed of the bus its travelling it at the point of time

              <p>If brakes fail, for auto remain in D and find parallel objects to slide the vehicle along to reduce speed.</p>

              <p>it will only reduce the speed by a bit which will not affect much. unless the bus is travelling at very slow speed then maybe changing to neutral will have some effects.</p>

              <p>This bus hit several cars at the junction before the bus stop. In D gear Voith provides quite a bit of engine brake when the accelerator is taken off.</p>

              <p>sometimes it depends on how strong the bus stop structure is, not fully on the speed of the bus...</p>

              <p>Apply handbrakes when the brakes fail is the craziest thing to do. Imagine you are travelling at 30-40km/h and your brakes fail and u apply your handbrake. Someone will definitely fly somewhere. Even driving a car at 15km/h and applying handbrake suddenly will cause a sudden jerk, much less a bus.</p>
              <p>Changing gear to N doesnt help in any way either as long as the road isnt uphill. If the road is uphill the bus will be slowed down more significantly than being on a flat road surface.</p>
              <p>Judging from the bus impact on the bus stop structure seems to suggest that the bus wasnt even at 60km/h at the Kaki Bt junction. Likely at 45 then became 35 after hitting the cars at the junction before hitting the bus stop structure at 20-25km/h.</p>

              <p>I saw a few KUBs with the warning 'Critical air pressure loss' and the BC drives on. Don't know if it's a matter of time such an accident would have happened, but maybe this will be a wake-up call.</p>

              <p>it will only reduce the speed by a bit which will not affect
                  much. unless the bus is travelling at very slow speed then maybe
                  changing to neutral will have some effects.</p>

              <p>A vehicle will coast when it switched to neutral. Any torque will not longer be chanelled to the wheel, and the rev will jump up since the power now goes nowhere.</p>
              <p>You're probably worse off in neutral while in motion because you will no longer have any engine power (be it acceleration or decceleration) but only the steering wheel.</p>
              <p>If the Voith retarder was working as intended, he should be able to get a little bit of engine braking so long his foot is off the gas pedal. (Definitely more than if he set the gearbox to neutral).</p>

              <p>this time it is lucky that someone manage to turn the bus towards the side of the bus stop and bus stop there... imagine if the whole bus go forward on the road and go hit a few more vehicles or go hit some other heavy vehicles /bus in front. i think sure more worst...</p>

              <p>If cant register regos with '6' , '4' , and 'D's , then use wad? Since the start of SBS(formerly know as Singapore Bus Services) , SBST had NEVER reused a rego. E.g. the Scania Demonstrater During the 80s to 90s : SBS7000E - Can u find this rego on the roads? I agree with this fellow forumer BUT it's SBST's final decision to say weather or not it will use the '4's , '6's , and 'D's in their rego.</p>
              <p>Peace?</p>
