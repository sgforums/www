            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, would you like to share your experiences about taking long long long long rides on Singapore Bus Services?<br><br>For me... yea... Service 51 (Hougang Central to Jurong East)<br><br>A butt pain experience, and also somewhat sleepy. Worst thing of all, if the driver is driving 50km/h, you're gonna fall asleep. How long can it be? From Hougang Central to North Bridge Rd takes an hour, and from North Bridge Rd to Jurong East takes another hour to an hour 10 mins. Along the winding and long route, you might get to see something interesting, or otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> The Sv 51 bus I took was SBS 9503 H. A record time of 2 hours and 9 mins was made. If one would like to try this long long long long distances bus rides, please clear your "water tanks" before heading on. And also, do some stretching exercises to prevent yourelf from getting tense muscles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I rode on sv 51 from JE to Hougang Sth before. I swore never to do that again. Another ardous journey is that of sv. 30. But unlike 51, I enjoy riding on 30 where I usually ride it to get to Geylang Serai. This is because 30 plies through the ECP and crosses the Benjamin Sheares Bridge giving you a panoramic view of the Singapore habour and skyline. The ex-502 was long too but it was quite exiciting when it entered the CTE tunnel especially if you're on the front seat of the upper deck. Another sv. which I swore never to ride again is 506. I took it once from Changi Airport to JE. Simply terrible. Finally, how can I forget the good ol Aircon 3 from Bedok to JE. My very first ride on an aircon bus and it was a very miserable experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most recent point to point ride was on Service 32: Bedok - Buona Vista. The ride took 1 hr 20min long. I slept from Tg Katong Rd all the way to North Boat Quay. Cool eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I took 30 once from BNL to Fort Rd. I forgot how long was that. What i remembered was that I sat on the front seat of the upper deck and had a nice picnic there. This was 3-4 years ago.<br><br>I've taken 8 28 31 (TPY - TAM) before. The most frequent of the 3 was 8 because it has the shortest point to point journey time.<br>8 took about 1 hr 5 min, 31 took 1 hr 15 min and 28 took 1 hr 25 min.<br><br>The 28 mentioned here passes TPJC (Old Route). I took this only once and it was in a Mk3! Lucky thing that the aircon isnt that bad.<br><br>The 8 journeys i take varies from DM Merz to VO 3x, while for 31 its a DM Merz as far as i can remember.<br><br>I've taken 989 from CGA to CCK once. That cost me about 1 hr 15-25 min. Cant remember exact time.<br><br>I've also taken 56 from BSH to MRC a few times before.. 45 min flat was the journey time.<br><br>Other than that... i dont think i've taken any long point to point trips before.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I remembered that last year, I took it from Chinatown to Woodlands. It took me an hour 05 mins to for that damn bloody long long long long journey! What's more, I was in a Scania L113CRL with ELBO Bodywork, whereby the air-con wasn't cold enough. A lot of aunties fanned themselves while they're in the bus.</div>
