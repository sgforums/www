              <p><br>I appreciate your advice but I wonder why must people thought of me as a free lancer. I have lots and lots of witnesses to the matter that is on my side. If that SBS8043A guy is my schoolmate, this matter would have been settled outside the forum. Why post it here IN PUBLIC to humiliate one's good reputation as an aspiring film maker and photographer. This can also be settled via Private Message as well. What if I accuse that guy that he has no work to do and wants to frame people up. You won't like it, correct?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, lesson is don't judge people by the cover. I apologise for going off-topic here but I must prove my stand agaisnt this injustice.</p>

              <p><br>Agree with you, I noticed that SBS7313C's slot was not suitable. It went to Kent Ridge to start at 3 pm and reached at Hougang at 4:20 pm and reached Kent Ridge at 6:00 pm. It went off service after that. I think SBS needs to consider them to be put in on other shifts starting from HG since it's the best way possible to tackle the NUS crowds. Only 1 exception was SBS7318 which shift seems to be suitable. It left Kent Ridge at about 5:45 pm after doing a trip on 151A. Then, it will reach Hougang at 7 pm and taken off service after that. From what I could say from what I observed, Sv 151 B9s seemed to all start the PM part of ths S shift from Kent Ridge.</p>

              <p>The actual school term has not started. This is the freshmen orientation week. Also NP should be having their study week / exams soon so there would be lesser students in campus. Most of the SIM classes won't resume until September. So the real loads we can only judge in October when all 3 tertiary institutions are having their normal scheduled classes.</p>

              <p><br>I appreciate your advice but I wonder why must people thought of me as a free lancer. I have lots and lots of witnesses to the matter that is on my side. If that SBS8043A guy is my schoolmate, this matter would have been settled outside the forum. Why post it here IN PUBLIC to humiliate one's good reputation as an aspiring film maker and photographer. This can also be settled via Private Message as well. What if I accuse that guy that he has no work to do and wants to frame people up. You won't like it, correct?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, lesson is don't judge people by the cover. I apologise for going off-topic here but I must prove my stand agaisnt this injustice.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Can you just stop. The matter has closed and you are still making a din about it. What for say sorry when you always make mistakes? And that by making a stance here, you are actually giving a chance for SBS8043A to shoot you again because you simply has no way to stop him. I suggest just ignore his comments and don't go further. He will win when you get agitated and angry. So do you gain? No.</p>
              <p>I am not here to side anyone. But I find that tintinspartan has got to control his behaviour in public and forums. He's arousing unwanted attentions.</p>
