I'm not sure how much one habit cost but one Citaro rigid 12m cost around $500k. But maybe they should at least get a demonstrator to test. hmmm... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, why do we need low floor buses in the first place?<br>To help the elderly? or simply to allow a disabled person to use public transport easily? To let mothers bring prams onboard?<br><br>Firstly lets compare, a SMRT o405 rigid can carry 41 seated passengers, what about a Citaro 12m rigid - 32 seated passengers. 9 seats are lost just for some convience for mothers, elderly and disabled. Is it really worth? Elderly can easily board the bus because there are less steps, but will they find a seat in peak hours? Somemore with SMRT's horrible frequency, how often will the bus be packed to the door due to the lower capicity of these WABs. imo, until SMRT has the resources and money to increase its frequency of most routes till everyone can easily get a seat, its just better to have more seats on high floor buses, at least the elderly can sit. Seldom will u see a bus in hk with full load to the door, even standing passengers are rare, so in that case everyone gets a seat, easy to board, and disabled passengers can use the wheelchair facility, but for a price: better frequency + better buses = more costly trips.</div>

I've seen one in Thailand and i dont think it is really nice! Hino may be considered. As for Mercedes, SMRT may choose the OC500LE and also the Scania K series. Hope they can bring in the MANs! Like those used in Malaysia! Anyone here would like to see MANs in SG?</div>
