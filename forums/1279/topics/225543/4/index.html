            <div class='col-md body'>Haha.. I second that...to choose NUS is indeed weird social bahavior....<br><br>Singaporean youths are indeed get weird, self centred and arrogant....as seen in the many emails and letters to forums about youths in general are pathetic......<br><br>After working overseas and now doing business overseas and here....there are so many sheltered kids and pathetic little emperors who need a whacking....no wonder many of us are leaving.....Hooray...<br><br>Just look at Saturday's letter in Straits Times<br><br>I know of many Singaporeans who say that people in other Asian cities such as Manila, Taipei and Karachi are far better mannered.<br><br>Saying that 'he's from Britain and they are rude too' does nothing to change the reality that rudeness tarnishes Singapore's reputation.<br><br>It was ranked 32nd in politeness while cities such as New York and Toronto, which are considered brash by Canadians and Americans, finished in the top ten.<br><br>Moreover, I have met many ex-Singaporeans living prosperous lives overseas who say that one reason why they do not want to return to Singapore is that they do not want to endure the bad manners.<br><br>Bad manners is probably also the reason why Singapore continues to slip in customer service rankings against other Asian cities - something which I am reminded of every time I go out for dinner here and compare it to my experiences in the Philippines, China or Taiwan.<br><br>A day before writing this letter, I was in a queue at a customer service office. An out-of-control toddler repeatedly shook the decorations off the Christmas tree.<br><br>After three minutes of doing nothing, his mother lured him away by tearing two brightly-coloured balls off the Christmas tree and dangled them in front of him.<br><br>She then put the balls into her purse. The ugly incident was compounded by the fact that none of the office staff spoke up in the name of good manners and civility.<br><br>In my experience, I have encountered many good-mannered and gracious Singaporeans but they are swamped by a younger generation that throws rubbish on the streets, squeezes you out as you get out of a lift and does not say thank you when you open a door for them.<br><br>Sometimes they rush past me and my wife when we open a door. You've got a long way to go Singapore, and recovery begins when the denial stops.<br><br>Eric James Brooks<br><br></div>

No way.....closing your eyes when they see an elderly couple standing in an MRT train....so uniquely Sillypore<br><br>From Sat's letter in the forum<br><br>On the feedback regarding our rude and inconsiderate youths, I would like to share my experience with National Servicemen.<br>On several occasions I saw them very comfortably seated in the trains and chatting, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.<br><br>Recently, I stood in front of six NSmen when an old couple boarded the train.<br><br>I noticed that the NSmen avoided looking at the elderly couple. I plucked up courage and asked the NSmen to give their seats to them.<br><br>They didn't do this. Instead, they egged on each other to be the chivalrous one. I was put off by their actions and exclaimed: "Unbelievable, shame on you!"<br><br>Several passengers looked in our direction. The NSmen succumbed under public scrutiny and pressure. Two of them reluctantly stood up but it was too late. The old couple was getting ready to alight after struggling to steady themselves through five stations.<br><br>That was how long it took for the NSmen to feel shamed by public pressure to give up their seats.<br><br>On other occasions, I witnessed men with their eyes closed and pretending to be asleep on the trains and buses when they noticed old folk, pregnant women and children boarding the vehicle.<br><br>How did I know they were not sleeping? Well, I saw them very much awake SMSing or talking on their handphones just before the needy ones came aboard.<br><br>Lau How Ngoh (Ms)<br></div>
