So what's your point?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Yes, I may be the only guy who promotes smoking but there are also in this entire world who are doing what I am promoting and they are enjoying it. </strong></blockquote>Just want to be clear about something, being a smoker and going around promoting smoking as a health benefit is a different thing. In fact, for most smokers, it's a habit, not so much a hobby but a habit. Of course there are others like you where smoking is a hobby. But for a person to have a hobby that is promoting smoking as a health benefit, that's quite different.<br><br></div>
