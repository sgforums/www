It may seem useless but it seems very useful for me and all ppl living in Bt Panjang as tat svc is the only direct service tat passes thru Bugis area.. Compared to MRT's NS Line, svc 960 is much more faster and takes lesser time for us to reach bugis area.. Same logic applies for 171 where tat is the only direct svc tat goes to Yishun..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
