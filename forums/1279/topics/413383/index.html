              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; font-size: 14.4px; border-collapse: collapse;">SINGAPORE: Transport Minister Raymond Lim said on Monday that bus route changes will be introduced gradually, in response to public feedback.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">In his written response to a parliament question from North West district mayor Teo Ho Pin, Mr Lim said majority of the residents whom the Land Transport Authority spoke to during its central bus planning consultations were not in favour of of major changes to existing bus routes which would be disruptive.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr Lim said this is also what they have learnt from the experience in other countries - that major 'big-bang' changes tend to be disruptive and confusing for commuters.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He stressed that changes to the system should be calibrated, incremental and progressive, guided by the principle that any change must benefit the majority of commuters.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Mr Lim said some route changes are expected by the end of the year and more will be progressively implemented later on.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Going forward, Mr Lim said LTA will periodically update advisers to the grassroots organisations on the major public transport improvements in their wards.<br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="font-size: 12px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">-CNA/ac</span></p>

              <p><br>well in e 1st place Lim Hwee Hwa got her facts wrong.</p>
              <p>1) Many of the long haul bus rts were in fact introduced when the MRT commenced, e same time to reduce buses on the congested CBD and not wat she claimed.</p>
              <p>2) Many of these long haul rts's distance cannot be simply looked at its net distance. Say Sv 67, from CCK to Little India is at least 14km alone.</p>
              <p>3) Where are e buses going to terminate? Carry on dreaming of those integrated public tpt hubs tat are cmi in reality. They want cos PAP can get to sell e land at record price, ppl build condo and get to easily collect property tax in future.</p>

              <p>I am not sure if you understand my concerns. Anyway just to reiterate, for making bus/train transfer for MRT stations along E-W line, one probably need to walk not more than 5min from Platform (not control station) to the nearest pair of bus stop. However that's not true for some Circle Line Stations, example Marymount and Holland V, one probably need to walk for 10min from Platform to bus stop. The ease in making bus/train transfer will definitely encourage more to switch to public transport.</p>

              <p>Well SWTs can only be implemented if that leg has much much higher loading than other stretches.</p>
              <p>There's no terminal available to be built at C'wealth. Furthermore, hubs n spokes dun mean all buses becomes short haul feedering svs. Buses will still have to be kept in spite of e MRT.</p>
              <p>For example.</p>
              <p>Sv 63</p>
              <p>The highest loading leg is Eunos - Ubi - Macpherson Est - Aljunied MRT. Even though the leg from Aljunied MRT - Chinatown is the next highest in loading, I believe it's in the ratio of 2: 1, hence there's Sv 63A to ply the highest leg.</p>
              <p>Sv 124</p>
              <p>There's 2 distinct high demand pt: St Michaels - Orchard &amp; Chinatown - Telok Blangah. But as the loading is almost similiar, there's no way a SWT can be implemented.</p>
