As long you don't snap in bus interchanges/terminals, it's okay de.. A lot of times, driver 'diao' me when i snap photos outside interchange and I diao back at him.. Should the driver really approached you and scold you like hell, talk back to him say that "this is NOT interchange/terminal and you do not have the right to stop me".<br><br>Few months back, I encountered a incident outside Tampines Interchange whereby a SMRT SL (TIB820H, Service 67) horned at me when I snapped his photo outside Tampines Interchange, and after he parked his bus, he approached me and scold here and there, and even demanded/threatened me to delete away the photos of his bus. He even took out his HP camera and snapped my face!!<br><br>On the day after this incident, I wrote a complaint e-mail to SMRT about it..<br><br><strong>What I wrote to SMRT:</strong><br><br>Registration number : TIB820H<br>Service No : 67<br>Date : Tuesday, 30th January 2007<br>Time : Around 10:18am<br>Boarding Point :<br>Direction of Travel : Tampines Interchange Title : Mr Name : Lim Wei<br>Liang Victor Sender : 60750@myrp.edu.sg Home Tel :<br>Office Tel :<br>Ez-Link Card No :<br>Address :<br>Message : I write in to lodge a complaint towards a Service Leader who<br>take photo of me (as in myself) and even demanded me to delete off the<br>photo of the bus photo he drove.<br><br>Please allow me to explain why i took photo of buses. I took photo of<br>buses is just merely for the sake of my own personal interest, as i<br>develop a passion of buses as 1 of my hobbies since young. I'm aware<br>that i cannot take photo of buses INSIDE the bus interchange as you guys<br>might claim that it's because of some security issues.<br><br>Ok, returning back to the incident i met. Let me explain the whole story<br>from stretch.<br><br>I was taking photo of buses OUTSIDE Tampines Regional Interchange (The<br>T-junction between Tampines Central 1 and Taempines Central 2) before<br>this Service 67 driver (TIB820H) came to approach me.<br><br>He approached me when i was sitting down with 1 of my friend in Tampines<br>Interchange, near the T junction along Tampines Central 1 and Tampines<br>Central 2, and asking me why i take photo of him, whereby i only merely<br>intended to take photo of the bus (At the T-junction). Indeed, i tell<br>him the reason that i take photo of the bus (which is solely because of<br>my personal interest).<br><br>He walked away after that for a moment, and he came back to look for me<br>again. This time he took out his handphone camera and took photo of me.<br>I did not cover his camera because knowing that i did not do anything<br>wrong or committed a crime, i do not need to fear anything from him,<br>hence i just let him to take photos of me for all he want. After which<br>he walked away again.<br><br>After a while, he came back to look for me once again. This time he<br>demanded me to take out my digital camera and deleted all the photos<br>that i took at that period of time. I was very reluctant at first and<br>told him why should i delete off when i did nothing wrong at all. Then<br>the SL asked me in a more fiercer tone whether i still insist on<br>deleting the photos.<br>In total, i took 2 photos of that particular bus, and after i deleted<br>off both of them, he still demanded me to delete off somemore and made<br>an assumption that i can take at least about 5 photos of that. Knowing<br>that he still insist on asking me to delete off, i showed him my digital<br>camera and scroll the photos that i took to prove him that i did not<br>have anymore of the bus photo of his.<br><br>Before he walked off, he even mentioned this sentence to me, "Don't let<br>me ever see you outside" and i also remembered that he mentioned<br>something about "creating troubles" too.<br><br>With this, i seriously do hope that the management of SMRT Buses will<br>look into this matter and deal with the SL very seriously. I do really<br>appreciate if i can get a constructive reply as soon as the<br>investigation has completed.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><strong>And the reply from SMRT:</strong><br><br>Dear Mr Lim<br><br>We refer to your feedback regarding the incident you encountered on 30 January 2007.<br><br>To share with you, SMRT do not allow members of the public to take photographs in our interchanges and MRT stations for security reasons.  This is in line with the security precautionary measures which we have undertaken as SMRT works closely with the security and emergency response agencies to manage security concerns, conduct audits, and enhance our capabilities to respond to contingencies and threats.<br><br>We have conducted a thorough investigation into the matter.  Due to our security guidelines mentioned above, the service leader concerned may have felt undue anxiety when he saw a member of public taking photographs of buses outside the Interchange. His supervisor has since advised him of the correct guidelines and counseled him on the importance of customer service. We have also stressed upon him to always conduct himself professionally when communicating with members of the public.  Do be assured that we will monitor his performance closely to ensure that he meets our service standards.<br><br>Whilst SMRT continues to do our part to ensure the safety of commuters, we seek commutersÂ’ cooperation to be considerate, abide by the guidelines and exercise personal responsibility to prevent incidents from happening.  For members of public who wish to take photographs in our premises, they may write in to ask for approval at corpcomms@smrt.com.sg.<br><br>We apologize for the unpleasant incident and thank you for highlighting the incident to us.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>Senior Officer, Customer Relations<br>Corporate Marketing and Communications<br>SMRT Corporation Ltd<br><br>From that incident onwards, any drivers who dare to be funny with me outside interchanges/terminals, I will not show any mercy to them..</div>
