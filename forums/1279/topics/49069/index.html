And if the software passes the test, trial runs to check the system's reliability could start by the end of the month, the LTA spokesman said.<br><br>The LTA said that the system is being paid for out of the $300 million earmarked for the ez-link system, but did not say how much it cost.<br><br>Meanwhile, the ez-link card is set to have more commercial uses beyond paying for public transport.<br><br>Information technology service provider Chowiz, which is behind a range of ez-link-related services in schools and food-court chain Kopitiam, is now talking to fast-food and other food and beverage outlets about using the card.<br><br>Currently, people can use the cards at Hotel Phoenix's The Food Shop and the Kopitiam outlet at Jurong Point mall, as well as pay for fines on overdue books at the Sembawang Community Library and library@orchard, and make purchases at some school canteens.<br><br>Tourists can also use it to get discounts at tourist attractions and restaurants.<br><br>Hotel Phoenix general manager Noel Hawkes said 20 to 30 out of 300 customers a day, including locals, pay for doughnuts, curry puffs and other savoury food at its cake shop with the card.<br><br>The hotel also has special deals for card-carriers. It now offers a latte and curry puff for $1.80 to those who pay with the card. The combination would otherwise cost $4.80.<br><br>Its guests can also use their room card keys, which are ez-link enabled, to travel on the bus and train.<br><br>Mr Hawkes said the hotel will continue to use the ez-link technology at its cake shop and rooms, but has no plans to extend it to its other restaurants as customers prefer to pay for more expensive items with credit cards.<br><br>Kopitiam's Jurong Point outlet, which has been accepting the card at only its drinks stall for about half a year, extended its use to its dessert and fruit sections two months ago.<br><br>About 4 per cent of the drinks and between 1 and 2 per cent of the desserts and fruits are bought using the card.<br><br>The food-court chain is looking for ways to increase the card's usage, said its corporate communications manager, Ms Low Wye Yee.<br><br>It has already earmarked some outlets in the downtown area and new towns such as Sengkang to introduce ez-link technology, but this will depend on the success of the Jurong Point outlet, she said.<br><br>Chowiz business development manager Emily Lim said that a 'big food and beverage outlet' is considering the system as means to track its employees' attendance and their temperature records.<br><br>Organisations such as the LTA, TransitLink and SMRT already use the card to control employees' access into their premises."<br><br>"Ez-link card made easier to use<br>EXPECT less fuss when paying for a concession pass and topping up the ez-link card:<br><br>Â• Students and full-time national servicemen can now buy their monthly concession TransitLink passes at its 77 add-value machines islandwide. The machines are in MRT stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.<br><br>Before, the passes could be bought only at ticket offices and had to be encoded manually on an ez-link card.<br><br>Users must have an ATM card that allows them to use Nets to pay for the passes.<br><br>Â• Those who use the ez-link card will soon be able to link it to their credit card.<br><br>The scheme is similar to the current Giro one, where the ez-link card is topped up automatically when its value drops below a certain pre-set level.<br><br>A six-month trial is scheduled to start between next month and September.<br><br>DRIVER DEPENDENT: Bus drivers have been manually updating the fare stages buf if they forget to do it or make a mistake, commuters can be overcharged.<br><br>AUTOMATED SYSTEM: The new set-up - a box behind the driver's seat relies on satellites to keep track of the bus' position."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Article extracted from Straits Time Interactive, 17 June 2003, Article "Bus fares set to go right on track "</span></span><br><br><span class="small">Click <a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,4386,195112,00.html?" rel="nofollow">here</a> to read the article.</span></div>

In addition, it would benefit the bus captains as they do not have to worry constantly about updating the stages, and they can hence focus more on driving more smoothly and safely, or providing better service</div>

Don't tell me you look at that inaccurate EDS....<br><br>If you have a chance, have a good look at that white laminated card that drivers have as their timetable. Besides listing the way points, you will notice that there are 2 rows at the end, which shows the non-peak and peak arrival times. If your observation is made during the peak hours, then the bus driver in question is on time. Also, the timetables are subject to change due to some reasons, such as the previous bus leaving the interchange late etc., especially for trunk services. The driver may be on time swiping his card to begin his shift, not before the start of the trip. The EZ-link system actually stores those info instead of the interchange, which is sometimes you hear the long beep as the bus nears the interchange and prints out a receipt from the validator.<br><br>It is common place to see drivers on 12-hour shifts, they are rather short on manpower. Not convinced? Take for example service 806, a feeder in Yishun. The same bus driver greets me as I board it at 0612  and when I board the same bus at 2030, the same bus driver is still servicing the route. Bus drivers also have to fill in for anybody who is late for their shift for the time being, as the bus companies cannot afford to let one bus sitting there just because the driver is late, especially if the freq. is quite long. It is very hard work, but bus drivers still have to make a living.<br><br>However, I somehow agree with you that the NEL should be manned, then it would open few months before this Friday. However, the main reason for LRT,NEL etc. to be driveless is one of prestige and advancement. Singapore needs this somehow, so that other countries would look up to us in terms of transport technology. Ever wondered why many major tech firms set up their business in US rather than in Africa, although start-up and maintainance cost is much higher? It is true that Singapore is being kiasu, but it may attract investors and act as consultancies in this area in the future if the NEL proves successful. It is true that employment is lost in the process, esp. in this times of recession, but in that case, shouldn't Singapore only have primary and low-tech secondary industries like textile factories, and not have so many banks, which is a tietiary industry since the former provides plenty of employment?<br><br>Isn't it because of raising our standard of living in the end?!</div>

By the way, my bus rego recognition is quite lousy, but when did 197 have SBS 1288 and SBS 1457, since SBS decided to put up the useless TV ? I dun think it is the MkIV, is it?</div>

The tow truck also took quite sometime to reach Bedok.</div>

I've seen drivers using handphones to make calls to the interchange who will then dispatch a tow truck.</div>
