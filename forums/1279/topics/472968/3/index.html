              <p>Rightly said.</p>
              <p>But I think the golden age for China's hybrid and electric buses might be over soon.</p>
              <p>Latest reports indicate China is getting tired of heavily subsidising the bus fleet that seems to be going no where unless govt keeps pouring money in.</p>
              <p>China isn't quite as rich as so many punters seem to think.</p>
              <p>As for OEM manufacturing techniques, sad to say, I have to agree with you. </p>
              <p>Most bodies these days are made of aluminium. And they can say all they like about aluminium being light, strong, fire resistant, etc etc.</p>
              <p>Bull-shit.</p>

              <p>This was the reason why USN never again built any ship using aluminium. They would rather sacrifice weight and rust advanatages and build using steel these days.</p>

                  like 911/912(obtaining bendies instead of rigids), <strong>184 getting back
                  some bendy buses, 963 getting bendy during peak</strong>, 962x971E getting
                  bendy etc. [It's <strong>on/off</strong> pattern]</span></p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm mentionning about the reliability of the arrival
                  timing, not the type of buses used. You've somewhat misread my
                  first post mentionning about DDs/Bendy stuff together with the top
                  2 paragraph. </p>
              <p>And let me ask you, even if you have full fleet DDs, can the
                  frequency be improve always? Likewise for the no. of buses used,
                  can it help to improve the frequency always?</p>

              <p>I have no intention of joining this debate or war whatsoever, but some things you have said are at best nit-picking, or simply ridiculous.</p>
              <p>IIRC Sv 184 and Sv 963's fleet have pretty much remained the same except for those BSEP rigids and the period when:<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <ul style="line-height: 1.231;">
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">184 went from KJ to WL which saw some bendies disappearing (seems to always happen when services get handed to WL huh?)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">963 almost had its bendy fleet suffered the same fate as Sv 61. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I don't think these really count as visible improvements.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you are describing things as being "on/off", then for the love of god I really have to pray very hard daily that the starter is kind enough to always deploy bendy on the slot that I take. </span></p>
              <p>For the last part on frequency, increase in fleet size would always result in better frequencies, but as we all know that's theoretical in nature due to road conditions etc.</p>
              <p>However, with more DDs in the fleet, even when frequencies happen to get badly distorted resulting in a build-up of passengers at a certain bus stop, the DDs that arrive have a higher chance to clear the bus stop and at least passengers can board and continue their journey. This <strong>buffer</strong> makes a hell lot of difference. Can't say so for SMRT services (Sv 857 anyone?).</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Anyway, what upgrades did 86 get? Still having cocky frequency as usual while waiting at Jalan Kayu icon_rolleyes.gif 
                  161 the problem is only peak hours, wrong choice of buses sometimes + inconsistant departure(can get lambat, not due to jams but driver left bus park late). 
                  Svc 88 seems to get SDs on/off oftenly, upgraded to "full" DD indeed. Compare with 161, I think 161 is better. </span></p>

              <p>For the first part, I'm sure BusAnalyser can furnish you with the information.</p>
              <p>The complain about Sv 88 is the real nit-picking part. So what having an SD appearing? If I'm not mistaken that usually occurs on weekends when the loading is less brutal. Heck, even when the loading is high I'm sure the KUB can take a little bit of punishment.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to be honest, nobody (at least 2601) intends to sound condescending or dismiss ideas/thoughts/explanations provided by you but clearly they must be well thought-out, logical and substantiated. As a young person, I guess it helps a lot if you give a moment of thought when you reply to posts and craft your responses in more proper sentences and language.</p>
              <p>Well, å¿ è¨€ç»ˆç©¶é€†è€³ï¼Œyou can either take what I have written so far as bullcrap or you could actually find some use in it. I hoped I have sounded reasonable thus far.</p>

              <p>27's frequency during peak hours(off peak too) is rather like
              2-3 buses = 1 bus(on normal svc). They come in 1 shot, go in 1
              shot. Sometimes creating a gap inbetween too. But that only happen
              in either one of the directions only. </p>
              <p>Anyway, SMRT recently keep having pull over buses from another
              depot to cover up..mainly WLDEP buses covering up for AM/KJ svc(or
              mass redeployment?) </p>

              did you realise how difficult it is for buses w/ better frequency and having to pass through difficult roads like Tampines Ave 4/ Tampines Ave 5 to maintain the headways properly?
              
              Even 179 can have 3 - 4 buses brunching during acad sem time during the AM peak by the time bus leaves NTU campus... 
              
              Till to this day, you still can't explain 911's erratic freq... 3 - 5 mins but in reality it can be 10 mins per bus...
