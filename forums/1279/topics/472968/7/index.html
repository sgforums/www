              <p>Hmm then 911 could be counted as a massive improvements then?
              5AP to 6AP, 3S1running on 911 during peak to 911E, and 1S2 convert
              to 911/911E. In all, 2 more buses are added(1AP, 1S150-Runs for
              crossover, didn't see in the past for evening). </p>
              <p>Infact, I also don't count them massive. If you want to say
              massive, it's more like 334 with almost all SDs convert to DDs.
              That's rather a big increase in the capacity of the fleet. Go
              compare with it, 88 is rather inbetween massive/minor.</p>

              <p>Given the type of operation system in Singapore, I don't even think ur bolded sentence is really true. People won't choose DTL over those buses because of the standard BUT rather the which transport will reach their home fast/or less transfer. <strong>At this point, you're just bias again about SMRT operations</strong> <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>Plus, All the MRT lines did breakdown once, for sure DTL will experience it(like duh). So are you going to say "Oh of course people will choose SMRT Buses over DTL considering how unreliable they are."? </p>
              <p>Come on la, only a bus fan will do that lame decision seriously <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> If everyone think like you, Singapore transport system can close down already. Because there's flaws all around the transport network, be it buses or trains, be it SBS Transit or SMRT...</p>

              <p>To start with realistic loading for SD is 70 pax and for DD is 120 pax. it can take a few more pax but that is with too much cramping.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I don't think there is any sense in continuing this conversation with you. And what I said about DTL is true. DTL will take away loading from SMRT services in a big way. You are the one who is super biased and I don't see anyone supporting your thoughts here.</p>
              <p>May be you have some close person working in SMRT and that's why the soft corner for them!! May be!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>And stop saying things like 161, 88, 27 are sub-par la.</p>
              <p>If they really are sub-par, then my 74 must be sh*t by comparison (I think can be improved but I certainly think its so much better than that stupid 171 and now, 854, to name a few services that caused be grief).</p>
              <p>And 151, 154 must be services that can't be saved. </p>
              <p>Fact is this:</p>
              <p>1. WRI is a scene of chaos. Period. I said before already. I used to stay in WDL in the 90s, before those horrific bendies came. It was so much better back then. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>2. SMRT is inherently disadvantaged by the way the bus market was divided. For reasons I have already mentioned.</p>

              <p>Yes DTL will take away loadings, but not because of some lame reason you're giving. They take away loadings is due to faster ride home or simply less transfer, not because of some stupid things we're saying here. Come on la, SMRT NSL/EWL breakdown a lot of times, but passengers still take it. Nobody cares about the background info you given, they only know that this mode of transport will bring them to work FAST. </p>

              <p>2. SMRT is inherently disadvantaged by the way the bus market
              was divided. For reasons I have already mentioned.</p>
              <p>3. Vertical integration was supposed to merge operations
              seamlessly. Instead it led to conflicts of interest (especially

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">4. The maintenance of SMRT in
              general is CMI. The same was mentioned with regards to the train at
              the COI after the 2011 incidents. The way the buses are driven also
              tend to be more dangerous. </span></p>
              <p>5. Mileage per bus in SMRTB is significantly higher than SBST.
              That goes some way in explaining the poorer conditions of the
              bus.</p>
              <p>6. LTA is unhappy with bendies. As are many members of
              public.</p>
              <p>7. In the next few years, we might see major shake-ups for the
              bus services. Don't be surprised to see new players replace SMRT.

              <p>If most buses are double deckers, are you going to be so sure that the future won't have many problems?

Don't forget nowadays, elderly are stronger because they learn the hardway in the past, whereas the future elderly, is currently experiencing laziness around.

              <p>1)Bus maintenance and care,Ok not 100% SBST is good but at least they met the criteria</p>
              <p>2)Infratstructure and logistic,SMRT slack big times,With the exception of Wldep/Wlbp,Amdep and Kjdep is way to small to store more newer buses let alone bendy buses.Understand Wenya but when is that?Imho SMRT no need many depots just 3 or 4 enough but with a capacity of at least 400 buses especially for Amdep.</p>
              <p>3)Over mileage for buses,Most of the buses wah piang mileage so high even for less than a month bus.</p>
              <p>4)Staff discipline SBST scores more than SMRT.Only a few SMRT BCs take care or report any faulty of their buses..Again SMRT group supervisor must be strict bout these.</p>
              <p>5)Just stop buying bendy buses,Our infrastructure and roads is not suitable for these monsters and what's the point of buying a few units when ppl are increasing?For the sake of being different?Old folks?Let them sit lower deck then but strangely its them who always love to go upper decks,Dont mention above 70 years old la.If this is Malaysia I dun give a hoot about them buying bendies.SMRT BCs drive faster due to their erratic run times not because they love to speed.Most of their fleets also not restricted that's why you see them whacking till 70..Again very dangerous for new BCs.They mostly only have class 3 so braking between light and heavy vehicles is totally differ.</p>
              <p>6)Stop those RWS routes and utilise the remaining fleets for better basic bus operation.NR routes should revamp..Passengers loading is decreasing since the extension and fare raise.Surprisingly it's Nite Owl who had a good loadings even though the operation hours and routing is different.</p>
              <p>7)Listen to public feedbacks and treat them seriously </p>
              <p>8)If 70% of above are met I'm sure SMRT a yard behind SBST in operation standards no doubt..</p>

              you got to realise... like it or not.. DTL will still be faster than 700 or 960... 
              
              700 and 960 has to face the Whitley Rd junction... That one is will forever be congested. The next thing for S960 is at Little India and Rochor [mind you, North South Expressway construction is going to start kicking in]... for S700 is at Orchard especially nearing Christmas.

              <p>Yes DTL will take away loadings, but not because of some lame

              home or simply less transfer, not because of some stupid things
              we're saying here. Come on la, SMRT NSL/EWL breakdown a lot of
              times, but passengers still take it. Nobody cares about the
              background info you given, they only know that this mode of

              <p>I think you should travel more. Can you really compare WDL and CCK to Boon Lay, Bedok, Jurong East.</p>
              <p>To start with Jurong East and Bedok, there is absolutely no problem. The alighting board is long and the boarding bay is huge. Even the parking space is well marked for all services. I don't see any problem with either of these temporary interchanges.</p>
              <p>Coming to Boon Lay, just imagine if instead of DDs, this Int was using bendies. You can't imagine what the situation would be. For the # of services plying here, Boon Lay is also well managed. </p>
              <p>WDL and CCK - always haphazard parking problems and problems of queuing on the boarding berths. Buses at WDL especially always leave behind schedule on the first stop itself. </p>

              <p>Outrageous. </p>
              <p>Tell me, how would 190 and 700 be affected. I would rather bus to MRT if I wanna go CBD. And vice versa. And so would many others. My few friends staying in BPJ would rather the bus even when the MRT starts operation. </p>
              <p>Why? Because those who choose buses are mostly those staying from the MRT station itself. And unfortunately they are the majority of BPJ. Given how lousy the LRT there is and how troublesome it is to have to transfer and take 10 over stops and transfer again to places like Orchard, I totally can foresee that 700 would still have its loads. As for 190, it takes only as less as 8 stops to BPJ without transfers thru the CTE. No wonder the horrific crowds that I think would more or less still remain when DTL starts. </p>
              <p>And yeah, on a final note, please don't cry and shout when you have to be late after squeezing into the long-waited shuttle buses due to inevitable jams in the morning should DTL breakdown (though rare). </p>

              <p><strong>Among the list</strong>, if you want to call 88 a "major" improvement, you're making me laugh. If you just compare 88 with SMRT, and you called it a "major", I think you really don't know how different and unfair it is. </p>
              <p>Yes, SBST done significant improvement, as overall. BUT svc 88 alone, is just a minor improvement if you go compare the difference. </p>
              <p>Where got people compare how big the chicken with a cat? =.=" You want to see how big the chicken, you oought to compare with chicken, not dog/cat or whatsover.</p>

              <p>sibei angsty thread.</p>
              <p>this one lagi more exciting than the Alvin Tan saga.</p>
              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p>I can see the big picture.</p>
              <p>But like my current batch of students, I cant be bothered to spoon-feed you. Not the least because I think I repeated myself a couple of times already.</p>
              <p>To SMB66X:</p>
              <p>Stop pretending to be "interested" in waging a combat of sorts here with me (and others) la. If you genuinely were, you would have been more coherent in your arguments, stop sticking to the same points, and then adopt dynamic posturing, which I would gamely counter as I see fit!</p>
              <p>Of course if you were to argue that you genuinely were interested, then all I can say is that your ability to think critically must be quite severely hampered.</p>
              <p>Your choice in argument, and that's the right you seek and get!</p>
              <p>To simply.90:</p>
              <p>If I read correctly, you were trying to say that I was trying to be nice about it?</p>
              <p>If that was the case, I can safely say, no I wasn't.</p>
              <p>If I misinterpreted, then its my bad.<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>But I stick by my point that I pity whoever gets to work with this fella.</p>
