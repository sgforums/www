              transfer again to places like Orchard, I totally can foresee that
              700 would still have its loads. As for 190, it takes only as less
              as 8 stops to BPJ without transfers thru the CTE. No wonder the

              Excuse me... What more can 1x or 2x more bus forming up on 2nd lane do to shorten the line???
              
              and... think you've no idea on driving... they stipulated a wider entrance lane is because they also hope buses can form up on 2nd lane.. so when the 1st 2 bus has departed.. the bus on the right lane can cut in and conduct alighting ops faster...
              
              if all gotta wait for 4th bus to depart... wait till how long.. and I'm going to apply this to WRI...

              <p>You come and tell me, do you even need so much double decks on the road? </p>
              <p>Some anon mention about DTL, and yes I agreed that the train is taking away the ridership and that have been what I've mentioned long ago. I also forsee certain service cutting short sooner or later, or even pull out. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, you're facing aging population. Are you so sure that the high influx of DDs will benefit them? Are you going to start pulling out DDs and introduce more SDs then? </p>
              <p>Don't forget there's Thomson Line etc., you as a manager, are you seriously going to start pumping more DDs on road until 2021? It's all about consideration, if the length of the bus seriously take up space, and bendy bus is really a major and long-term problem, LTA would have already cut a stop to it immediately like London transport does.</p>
              <p>Adding on : It's either I don't understand your analogy or you're not clear enough and I admit I often "DIY" those difficult ones. Plus, I'm not that into buses, only designs. </p>

              I can tell you why... This is from what I know from govt officials... I shan't name who...
              
              To begin with, the HK govt is alrdy trying to cut down on buses especially in Kowloon n certain corridor of HK Island...
              
              SBS also faced this back in the 1980s.... Back in early 1980s slowly rationalising bus rts to better cope w/ New Town devt and cutting down bus traffic in CBD [duiz, Bus 30 used to ply Shenton Way, which was later amended to ply ECP nearly immediately after the ECP opened in 1981].. and eventually after 1987, the MRT's intro..
              
              Nothing similar?

              they stipulated a wider entrance lane is because they also hope

If they have implemented a system to assist the flow, BNL wouldn't be a problem, same for Woodlands. It's hard for buses in Woodlands to have faster alighting, even if there's no Bendy. You only have 2.5 Lane, the space is somewhat limited, how to even make alighting fast? At least for sure, the waiting time isn't long as there's 3 mixed model inside. </p>

              Little India have to be xtra careful.Fare evaders boarding from 3rd
              rear door when ppl alight one thing,Kena horn by behind buses one
              thing and worst if its raining and the bus shelter is too short or
              kena got bus stop construction,Wah piang eh.<strong>Even SMRT feel the heat
              of maintance the bendies that's one reason why they put on hold for

              <p>171 must be preserved..it serves as the bus linking them to their Army camp, same for 169. </p>
              <p>Bolded : I don't even think there's any production batch in the purchase list yet, only rumours. As I've said, the win win situation would be to have Bendy and DDs together. There's no replacement for bendy unless they go cut down or replace the road environment, which Idk will they do it. </p>

              <p>I'm not comparing them. Because the "strategy" is totally
              different. Infact, if Woodlands would to be wider, I don't think
              the past problem will happen. Since you all so like to say that
              Woodlands is considered "chao"[when it is not considered by me], I
              take it as an agreed since the interchange space and the number of
              svc is totally big gap lorh...</p>

              I can tell you something.. Woodlands's driveway is actually very wide... compared to other BI...
              
              it's a much better facility because of its location...

              <p>2016 is an election year. The government won't and cannot afford to let the issues of SMRT Buses become a full-blown crisis.</p>
              <p>Recall the last time SLs went on strike, who had to clean up for SMRT?</p>
              <p>If SMRT Buses gives up in 2016, whoever acquires the fleet would probably have a massive spring clean.</p>
