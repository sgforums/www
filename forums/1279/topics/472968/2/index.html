              <p>Nope, not always true. Looking at the arrival timing...</p>
              <p>Not bias stand, but SBS Transit is also not reliable. I can say that for SMRT, the reliability is rather up/down type, and most of the time, it's always the major svc that's causing the problem. You can say it's 70% unreliable, 30% reliable(average). </p>
              <p>For SBS Transit, it's also the same. However, it's mostly the minor svc and a few major svc. Few major svc like 161, 27, 74 etc. often have the problem. It's rather 60% unreliable, 40% reliable(average).</p>
              <p>As for the bus maintenace, I would say none of the operators really provide at least half of the quality. We have aircon faulty, damage seats(basically handle, but rather less), unscrew bells, dirts and algae all around, and even water stored in the bus(those double decks especially).</p>

              <p>I don't know what you are talking about. sv 27 has a 04-05 min peak frequency, sv 161 capacity has been beefed up and has been made full fleet DD, sv 74 has 07-08 min peak frequency.</p>
              <p>You are very biased. Show me one SMRT service that is even full fleet bendy? They cannot afford it. Just pass bendies from one service to the other and show improvements. If you talk about frequency, SMRT services have the worst frequency. What are the improvements to major services in the last few months? Hardly any..</p>
              <p>Sv 854, 857 still packed to door and no relied. Sv 72, 88, 185 so much improvement with capacity add.</p>
              <p>SBST ordered 500 new high capacity buses, SMRT ???</p>
              <p>What you talking leh???</p>
              <p>SBST is 100 times better than SMRT. It may not be perfect and for any bus operations it is difficult to be perfect given the loading patterns, traffic jams.</p>

              <p><br>I completely agree with you bro... IF SMRT was committed to improve its services, it would have made changes to its infrastructure and problems. Same old problems, no improvements.</p>
              <p>It has been a year and no announcement on high capacity buses. With increasing population especially in Yishun, CCK and Woodlands area, you need more high capacity buses than just adding buses. But no!! It is adamant to continue its poor operations.</p>
              <p>All buses have crossovers. They have problems with their fleet size, with parking, with depots, interchanges. Problems and problems. It will be good for SG if SMRT opts out.</p>

              <p>Painting buses with LTA livery has a huge political cost. It is tantamount to admitting in public the government has nationalised public transport.</p>
              <p>DTL trains appear less obvious to the public because the entire system is underground.</p>
              <p>But which foreign player is willing to enter an unprofitable business and turn things around? Veolia is trying to reduce their share on Veolia Transdev. First Group is exiting bus operations in London altogether.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit as the sole public bus operator might be the remaining option. When that happens, be prepared to kiss bendy buses goodbye.</p>

              <p>You are very biased. Show me one SMRT service that is even full
              fleet bendy? They cannot afford it. Just pass bendies from one
              service to the other and show improvements. If you talk about
              frequency, SMRT services have the worst frequency. What are the
              improvements to major services in the last few months? Hardly
              any..</p>
              <p>Sv 854, 857 still packed to door and no relied. Sv 72, 88, 185
              so much improvement with capacity add.</p>
              <p>SBST ordered 500 new high capacity buses, SMRT ???</p>
              <p>What you talking leh???</p>
              <p>SBST is 100 times better than SMRT. It may not be perfect and
              for any bus operations it is difficult to be perfect given the
              loading patterns, traffic jams.</p>

              <p>Svc27 sometimes can delay departure during off peaks, same goes for 161. 161 is rather common instead. There's always inconsistent departure during peak(against IRIS and timetable) if you compare it against 168. </p>
              <p>Mentioned above, most of the SMRT svc are like up/downs one..There's time where you get a good frequency, and there's time where you don't(Svc like 962, 964, 187(?), 172) Svc like(personally experience) 966/960 would often get poor/rubbish frequency, and they are always poor. </p>
              <p>I would say that the arrangement of BSEP buses at specific timing do help to solve the issue a little. Putting aside the BSEP, the fleet changing/introduction of SWT is rather improving the frequency like on/off. But generally, there's some fleet having a reliable frequency at some point in time, that's why it's up/down pattern, doesn't have a constant one.</p>

              <p>I'm half agree with the bolded statement, but rather I would just watch and see what's their move. Furthermore, by looking at the SMB rego, they only have 1 bendy so far. Rumours of 30 MAN A24 etc., are just rumours(can be true/fake). Rather, it's the management that's not really willing to serve. </p>
              <p>You just need to be patience, wait and see. First SMB bendy only, doesn't mean they totally rejects the DD option. </p>
