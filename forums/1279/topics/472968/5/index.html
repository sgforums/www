              <p>One Wednesday Night. I remember it was 9.40pm i was waiting at CIQ. 283K came with 911E, 5 mins later 284H arrived with 911. The lorries wasnt that congested to the point it hold up buses at the back as all the other buses arrived smoothly except for 911.</p>

              <p>911 &gt; 7buses, 6AP/1S(as of the latest, previously 5AP/1S).</p>
              <p>During the 5AP/1S time, the waiting time is even longer with only 4 buses running, 1 on 911E. That time, only close to 0-1 911 bus is doing the CIQ side. When u can closely wait up till 20mins for 1 911 bus. </p>
              <p>You can try waiting for 1 911 bus at CIQ and at Woodlands Interchange. I've tried it and the headways at Int is better without the 911E. Since you guys still mention that CIQ shouldn't be an issue, explain how can an off peak frequency with 6 buses be so much different than a starting peak frequency with the same 6 buses? </p>

              <p>What else SMRT can give to 911 now? Don't forget the yellow box isn't effective for that period of time where vehicles stop there, limiting the space. Most of the drivers rather play safe than being daring, and thereafter tried to rush when they turn out.</p>
              <p>Plus, that's the best vehicle seen so far to run on such narrow road/turning. </p>

              <p>The load is about the same for both off peak and peak, that's why I mentioned the "starting" word there. </p>
              <p>And at start, I've mention about the cause(CIQ) of the irregular headways u've mentioned. Go compare the waiting time for afternoon school release hours and evening ones.</p>

              <p>One Wednesday Night. I remember it was 9.40pm i was waiting at
              CIQ. 283K came with 911E, 5 mins later 284H arrived with 911. The
              lorries wasnt that congested to the point it hold up buses at the
              back as all the other buses arrived smoothly except for 911.</p>

              <p>AFAIK, the SDs were often scheduled closely. Also, if it's the 3rd buses arriving at bus stop, it will get hold up easily when departing.</p>

              <p>911 still meets some of the standard though, likewise for other services. If it's 3-5mins per bus, and given sufficient no. of buses to run for specific timing, there's not a need for bendy buses.</p>

              <p>Infact, I feel that there's not a need to deploy many buses on 927. The trip to Zoo from CCK can be rather empty sometimes. But on the other hand, there's somewhat a need for more buses from Zoo to CCK. </p>
              <p>At least for 138, there's demand to and from Zoo, perhaps the location(AMK) that's near CGA or direct bus from CGA(24). Likewise, 138 should be more popular to people.</p>

              <p>Precisely why I want to see all buses bearing Transitlink logos in future. Public transport should be nationalised and nobody deserves full ownership of any of the bus fleets except the relevant authority itself.</p>
