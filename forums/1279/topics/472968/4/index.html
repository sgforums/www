              <p>161 the problem is only peak hours, wrong choice of buses
              sometimes + inconsistant departure(can get lambat, not due to jams

              <p>Svc 88 seems to get SDs on/off oftenly, upgraded to "full" DD

              speaking of noon time..
              
              S966 also another one... 1 min freq also have.. bus run empty towards Woodlands... SMRT that trip make a loss of at least $15... very good and not cocky freq... miss one, next one come very fast... good...
              
              but at a price of minimum loss of $15... That's easily 20% of SMRT's losses per bus on Avg based on their latest Qtr financial report... 
              
              No need for me to dig 985 is another one... On some days, 506 even more frequent than 985...

              <p>Till now I still have to put up with 27's inconsistent frequency. And 45 and 163's horrific frequency. But I can frankly tell you, 965's frequency, since the introduction of BSEP, has become better than the past. 45 even with BSEP is still as slow as before. </p>
              <p>I'll agree that SMRT is worse than SBST in bus maintenance, reliability and general frequency. However SBST has its own faults too. As you all said nature etc makes no operator perfect, so what gives you all the right to think SBST should be the sole operator in Singapore?</p>
              <p>If SBST takes over the whole of Singapore it just let SBST monopolise all bus operations and there will be a lack of competitors. And that will be DISASTROUS. So yes I welcome SBST take over some of SMRT but, please, not all. </p>

              <p>SMRT only good at releasing express services. Out of so many they released and announced, only 2 are trunk/feeder and others are express services. If people really require these express services, it should be private operators taking over instead.</p>

              <p>They also have another point, and that is being able to take up more pax, so there wouldn't be alot of people waiting for a bus at the same time. Why don't you try to take over one of the companies(either SBST or SMRT) instead of getting yourself flamed here. At least you do something more meaningful. Even if you take over one of those companies, I doubt it will survive for long or rather you will survive for long.</p>

              another thing.. SMRT's routes... peakish in nature...
              
              Ya.. keep on adding more normal buses on 106, 700 esp during AM peak... but more empty buses pushed back from CBD.
              
              The return leg are as good as big losses, or even wipe out whatever peak dir's profits.
              
              SMRT could have used ADDs to resolve some of these fleet issues say on 106... Than keep on throwing more and more buses to like no tomorrow...
              
              And to make it clear.. it's alrdy a big joke to SMRT.. 106 1st bus stop need downroute alrdy... 
              
              I dare say.. 106 is alrdy beginning to be a massive loss making bus rt thanks to the ops method...
              
              made worst is use of MAN buses... narrow aisle... I ever saw it took 1 min for pax to alight at typical bus stop cos aisle too narrow...

              <p>I have no intention of joining this debate or war whatsoever,
              but some things you have said are at best nit-picking, or simply
              ridiculous.</p>
              <p>IIRC Sv 184 and Sv 963's fleet have pretty much remained the
              same except for those BSEP rigids and the period when:<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <ul style="line-height: 1.231;">
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">184 went from KJ to WL which
              saw some bendies disappearing (seems to always happen when services
              get handed to WL huh?)</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">963 almost had its bendy
              fleet suffered the same fate as Sv 61. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p>I don't think these really count as visible improvements.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you are describing things
              as being "on/off", then for the love of god I really have to pray
              very hard daily that the starter is kind enough to always deploy
              bendy on the slot that I take. </span></p>
              <p>For the last part on frequency, increase in fleet size would
              always result in better frequencies, but as we all know that's
              theoretical in nature due to road conditions etc.</p>
              <p>However, with more DDs in the fleet, even when frequencies
              happen to get badly distorted resulting in a build-up of passengers
              at a certain bus stop, the DDs that arrive have a higher chance to
              clear the bus stop and at least passengers can board and continue
              their journey. This <strong>buffer</strong> makes a hell lot
              of difference. Can't say so for SMRT services (Sv 857 anyone?).</p>
              <p>For the first part, I'm sure BusAnalyser can furnish you with
              the information.</p>
              <p>The complain about Sv 88 is the real nit-picking part. So what
              having an SD appearing? If I'm not mistaken that usually occurs on
              weekends when the loading is less brutal. Heck, even when the
              loading is high I'm sure the KUB can take a little bit of
              punishment.</p>
              <p>Lastly, to be honest, nobody (at least 2601) intends to sound
              condescending or dismiss ideas/thoughts/explanations provided by
              you but clearly they must be well thought-out, logical and
              substantiated. As a young person, I guess it helps a lot if you
              give a moment of thought when you reply to posts and craft your
              responses in more proper sentences and language.</p>
              <p>Well, å¿ è¨€ç»ˆç©¶é€†è€³ï¼Œyou can either take what I have written so far as
              bullcrap or you could actually find some use in it. I hoped I have
              sounded reasonable thus far.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I don't really share the same view about the DDs part. Yes I agree that the DD gets to clear off the load more, BUT if you see 161, after getting full fleet DD, it's still didn't perform to expectation like 168 does. You'll get delayed departure from the driver, further more, the interval isn't like 168. I don't mind waiting longer for bunch ups, but seriously svc161(and some others) are like some of the SMRT services.</p>
              <p>How can it really prove to me fully that DDs are better? The interchange is known to filled the bus to at least 90% or more, why isn't it improve then? By right, all buses won't be packed to the door during peak, after leaving Wdl Int, even a Citaro(168) does it.</p>
              <p>"Increased in fleet size =/= better frequencies" doesn't apply to all service, some of the services is just adding more buses to join the jam[Usually didn't see bunches, and first 1-2 ones are full].</p>
              <p>For 963/184 part, it only happen on and off. By saying on and off, it really means that it's not so consistant already. And indeed, their frequency during peak hours is more like normal frequencies during off peak. I'm not sure if it's lack of buses or what, but I'm sure at least some buses come in bunches. </p>
              <p>88 - I'm just abit irritated by the SDs appearance. No bunches somemore and the bus is somewhat full when I last board it. </p>

              CIQ area cock up isn't that bad... cos cars can even use Woodlands Centre to get into Wooldands CIQ... only 170, 950 can use this access...
              
              in the first place.. 911 this kind of rt and housing profile... need bendy bus even? if it's 3 - 5 mins as per stipulated?

              I've ever been to Woodlands Centre before on 1 evening peak...
              
              I do see 856 arriving as per stipulated.. the problem is simply isolated to 911..
              
              very very surprising ppl use CIQ to support the argument...

              sadly that can't be the case for 927 based on the BPLRT 1999 rationalisation routing
