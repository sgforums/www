              <p>Service 334 - Ply from Jurong East Interchange to Along Jurong East &amp; West Avenue 1 &amp; Jurong West Street 42</p>
              <p>YES thats true.SERVICE 334 FEEDER BUS MUST HAVE A DD....because during peak hours,some workers can't get to Jurong East MRT station in the morning and can get to home for dinner during evening time from 6.30pm to 8pm.Therefore Service 334 MUST HAVE AT LEAST 2-3 DD on Peak Hours.</p>
              <p>Service 185 - Ply from Soon Lee Depot to Buona Vista Terminal</p>
              <p>For 185,some Singapore Polytechnic students from Jurong West &amp; East says that it is poor service and frequency.Some of them have to wait at least 15 mins.They should cut down the frequency to 7 mins.The frequency is too long that some students can't get on time.Therefore service 185 need a better frequency by putting up more buses or 7mins to stop each and every stop.</p>
              <p>Service 151 - Ply from Hougang Central Interchange to Kent Ridge Ter.</p>
              <p>Recently,I heard that on 11/02/08,Monday Straits Times paper,passengers complaint that service 151 its is packed with full of passengers during peak hours. Some NUS students can't get to their campus as soon or early as possible through service 151.Therefore,they planned to have a SMRT bus service to duplicate the routes of service 151 that plys from Hougang Central to Kent Ridge.</p>

              <p>if svc 185 frequency is 7 mins, i thought bus bunching can occur coz it plies along PIE ?</p>
              <p>if the frequency is 15 mins for eg, the bus is at jw ave 1 blk 538 bus stop, then by the time this bus is at clementi ave 6, the next bus arrives at blk 538 bus stop</p>
              <p>as a s'pore poly student, i think i have not problem getting 185 coz i know the timings... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Peak hours doesnt mean that every single trip of 185 has to be the same.. Who knows ? there might be a bus that has just left before u board the DM3500. Which explains why the DM3500 is empty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on your theory that Merdz is full load and DM3500 is empty. Are you trying to imply that our Merdz is 9.6m long while our Mk4 DM3500s are 14.5m long ??</p>

              <p>What I ment was to duplicate the service of 151.That means that maybe SMRT is going to have a new bus service &amp; new number.Not giving 151 to SMRT buses.Not that.That means that there's might be 2 buses to Kent Ridge.One is SBS Transit 151 and another maybe a new SMRT bus service.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT wants better profits</p>
              <p>Actually supplementary trips would be better. Oftenly I noticed tat whenever Sv 151 gets rescheduled, always either NP or NUS is having break... SBS lacks coordination in their scheduling</p>

              <p>Service 334 - Ply from Jurong East Interchange to Along Jurong East &amp; West Avenue 1 &amp; Jurong West Street 42</p>
              <p>YES thats true.SERVICE 334 FEEDER BUS MUST HAVE A DD....because during peak hours,some workers can't get to Jurong East MRT station in the morning and can get to home for dinner during evening time from 6.30pm to 8pm.Therefore Service 334 MUST HAVE AT LEAST 2-3 DD on Peak Hours.</p>
              <p>Service 185 - Ply from Soon Lee Depot to Buona Vista Terminal</p>
              <p>For 185,some Singapore Polytechnic students from Jurong West &amp; East says that it is poor service and frequency.Some of them have to wait at least 15 mins.They should cut down the frequency to 7 mins.The frequency is too long that some students can't get on time.Therefore service 185 need a better frequency by putting up more buses or 7mins to stop each and every stop.</p>
              <p>Service 151 - Ply from Hougang Central Interchange to Kent Ridge Ter.</p>
              <p>Recently,I heard that on 11/02/08,Monday Straits Times paper,passengers complaint that service 151 its is packed with full of passengers during peak hours. Some NUS students can't get to their campus as soon or early as possible through service 151.Therefore,they planned to have a SMRT bus service to duplicate the routes of service 151 that plys from Hougang Central to Kent Ridge.</p>

              <p>I agree that Service 334 must have a Perm DD... It has been my observation since my grandmother lives in Jurong West...I take 334 from Jurong East and the bust was fully packe at one go and the next bus come and packed to the brim....</p>
              <p>But with the Frequency of 334, i think not the time yet coz, 334's frequency is quite good...(Since it has been like Beginning of 2007, the last time i board the bus)</p>
