              <p>i did not say PIW MUST wait for a WAB DD...but if there is 1 B9TL that comes by it would help to easen the space for more passengers to get onboard and the PIW wun have trouble getting off as there owuldnt be as many passenegrs crowding around it as compared to a K230...1 b9tl compared to 1 K230 can do alot of difference man...every trip it makes counts and it helps to easen the load...if theres 2...the PIWs can board too...if its a VO..the PIWs have to wait and cram inside a K230 with all the passengers if its during the period where demand is high...</p>

              <p>they can all route groups can..a BC can choose to be perm in what service if there is vacancy..if no vacancy then left with 197..then enter 197..if they dont want enter they can continue to be a standby BC</p>
              <p>same principle for boon lay..if left with for example service 30 with vacant slots fro BC to perm in..then that BC can only enter 30 lo..but usually BNL got a lot of service to choose to PERM in...its not everymorning choose what service to drive..they choose by learning the route...if they haven learn 30..they cannot perm 30..standby also cannot standby on service 30..but norm they will have to learn all services first..but they can choose NOT to enter service 30 and enter other service talk to a BC or me personally to find out...</p>
