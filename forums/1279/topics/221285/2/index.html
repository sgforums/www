By charging Express fares (like 502)?<br><br>Unlike many other new towns, Marine Parade has no train system and therefore it is very dependent on buses. SBST and SMRT has introduced several new services in the last few years to improve the bus services in Marine Parade (e.g. 966, 43, 48, etc). But for Marine Parade residents, 36 is still the most important service. (Which other service can bring you from Marine Parade to the most happening shopping &amp; entertainment district?

Not many people will consider 16 or 196.)<br><br>Maybe SBST should introduce a new expressway service from Marine Parade to Harbourfront to divert some of the Marine Parade people to VivoCity. Ikea can also consider introducing a shuttle service from Marine Parade to the new Ikea store in Tampines. In that case, Marine Parade residents have more choices when they want to hang out, and everybody will not overcrowd the poor 36 buses.<br><br>By eventually, to solve the problem in the long term, I think Marine Parade should build a rail network...

I'm not saying that Marine Parade residents has only ONE choice... I mean that 36 is one of the more popular choices. Although I don't live in MP, I attended school in MP before. When it comes to hanging out, my friends and I normally go to Parkway Parade, Suntec, Marina Centre or Orchard. Although 196 can reach Suntec &amp; Marine Centre too, we still prefer 36 because it's more convenient and direct to reach the Suntec Carrefour, Suntec cinema and GV Marina cinema. 36 is also good in the sense that it makes a loop in Orchard and we can reach places like Lido and CK Tang without crossing the road twice.<br><br>And I believe buses is still the main mode of public transport in MP. Not everyone can afford cab so often... As for the Eastern Regional Line, we dunno how long we have to wait... Currently the government seems to be more concerned with improving the transportation in Downtown and the Marina area...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suntec = 36<br>Shenton Way = 196/196e<br>Suntec =/= 196<br><br>I personally experienced the journey time between a S14 VO and a S36 Mk4 DM3500 during off peak hours from TG Katong Rd/Mountbatten junction to Esplanade junction is the same. So technically speaking, 36 reaches Suntec Carrefour first before 196.<br><br>36 covers more of Suntec than 196 and people are just darn lazy to cross overhead bridges so wait long long if you want people to take the "strengthened sv196".<br><br>I seriously dont understand what do you mean by strengthened 196. 196 didnt have fleet addition in recent times. So strengthened in terms of what? frequency? its still 10-14min u know.<br><br>Even if there's 196, why would people take 36 instead of 196 to MP?<br><br>1. 36 has express sector, 196 doesnt. This creates a perception of the commuters that 36 is faster than 196 but in actual fact the difference in the travelling time under normal traffic conditions is about 5min only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2. 36 covers more of suntec. Just look at where people board and alight you will know already. Mr 1688 you said you know your 36 loads so can are you able to tell me where do people board and alight at Suntec wrt S36?<br><br>Bus Bunching is inevitable. As you know Orchard Rd is a bloody killer. Some drivers buay zai so they dont dare chiong and thus behind schedule.. Others zai enough chiong and yet still on schedule. it may seem that the frequency is 3-6min but you never think what's the frequency before the bus bunching? Its at least 20min!<br><br>36 uses 12 buses (excluding the S3 bus in the morning) on weekdays, and 11 on weekends. There's no fleet addition on weekends. Its just that the perm buses were not in service, that's all. Dont argue with me the fact that its not the case. Go and sit at Mountbatten Rd for 1.5 hours and count the buses that run in both directions and you will know what I mean.</div>

However, you are talking about boarding from Suntec, then you see your luck or your gut feel. Sometimes the 2nd 36 will take 6-8min to come instead of 4-5min. (Assumption based on 1st bus behind schedule and 2nd bus on schedule)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun wish to argue here but...<br><br>try taking sv36 from town bac to Marine Parade during EVENING peak. The bus is already 3/4 full even b4 it hits SiCEC. The loading will be mainly at SICEC bs instead of Carrefour BS coz no1 can board.<br>Y i advocate pax to move to sv196 during evening peak is due to the jam on slip road ECP and on ECP itself.<br>The jams on ECP will wear everyone out. The Express sector is just a "perception" during evening peak coz slow moving traffic is on ECP evday.<br>so sv196 or sv14 is still faster.<br>I will not argue with u on sv36 weekend/Public Hols fleet.<br>las qn, for urself do you stay in e EAST or frequently take buses yo the east fr Suntec/Orchard Area coz me/my fren do it daily.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Implement another new bus service starting from Upper East Coast bus terminal to HarbourFront bus terminal passing through Suntec and Orchard Road. Maybe it can help to solve the overcrowding. DDs can be used along the bus route during peak hours. There is also no direct bus connection from Marine Parade to Harbourfront and Vivo City.
