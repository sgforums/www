As Teck Whye, it was expanded until almost similar to the route of 307 in Teck Why today. In 1995(if i'm not wrong), Feeder 303 was made to serve the then-undeveloped area of Choa Chu kang North. It's original route was just until Choa Chu Kang North 5, eventually, as HDB dwellers moved in to the north, it was extended up to Yew Tee MRT.</div></blockquote>Feeder 302 &amp; 303 was introduced in 1994, not 1995.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by cck_190:<br><br><strong>In 1999, when Tibs took over, 307 remained until somewhere 2000. This was when Tibs cut short the Intra-Town and it became a feeder.At this time, DAFs and sometimes MB0405G Many Teck Whye residents who lived there complained to the MPs around there(that's what was said in the news) and it became a big issue. once the issue of 307 even appeared in the news. Tibs gradually extended it first with a completely different route during the 2001 general elections. When over, tibs restored the full old route back with a few changes, and the called it an "ENHANCEMENT" by THEM...when it is actually just a restoration of the old service. This was when the fleet of CAC 0405s came in. there you go, history of Townlink 307...a service which celebrates it's 15th anniversary this year.</strong></blockquote><br><br>307 was cut short due to LRT rationalisation. In 2000, Hino HT238K and Nissan U31RCN that were deployed on 175 do appear on 300, 302 &amp; 307 for a brief period. Due to feedback from Teck Whye residents, 307 was enhanced to serve the residents of Teck Whye.<br><br>Svc 300 has also Green &amp; White Plate if I'm not wrong.</div>
