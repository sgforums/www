The feeders serve those areas which the trunk services don't ply such as Ring Rd, Ave 4, Ave 6, Ave 11 etc. That's why demand is high as passengers can only take these feeders to these areas.<br><br>Areas which SBST feeders serve usually have trunk services plying there or nearby or even duplicate part of the route.</div>

Quite sensitive. Maybe for buses 911, 912 and 913, the frequencies are low or something. However, i was rather amazed by service 806. Initially, I thought its route is very impressive but later I found out from TL guide that its route is rather short because its demand is really high. During the evening peak, while I was waiting for bus service 853, three or about four bus 806 (all bendies) have left the yishun interchange. What U guys said I think is really true about the fact that only feeders serve the places where trunk services don't serve. So, is there a possibility that SMRT will introduce trunk services that ply all the routes that only feeders cover?</div>

SBST doesnt have much DDs to ply on feeders. moreover, if this is done, the DDs would not even be half-loaded. 222 is such a case, everytime i take their DDs, towards chai chee, there wud only be abt 5 ppl on the upper deck. and the DDs seem to have disappeared.<br><br>in short, yes, feeders/townlinks are "hotter" in SMRT than in SBST.</div>

They may decide not to or even extend to somewhere else. My point is that it can easily be extended to some other areas without the confusion when converting from feeder to trunk service.</div>
