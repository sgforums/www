So if a trunk service costs 90 cents (cash) to operate from point A to point B, and the feeder costs the same for the same distance, I see nothing wrong with calling the service a trunk service.<br><br>Do note that many feeder-turned-trunk services have their fare stages staggered to be like feeder fares in certain parts, like 101, 112, 113. Even trunk services like 962 had the fare stage staggered (4 bus stops at fare stage 7.5) when it was amended to ply Sembawang Way. Fare stage from Gambas to Sembawang Drive back then was 7.0 to 8.0 or 7.5 to 8.0.</div>
