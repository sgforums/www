              <p>a sub-terminal doesn't have to be shabby, roadside or look like something out of the 90s. they can be converted from existing open-air carparks (and the carpark built on top of the terminal). space needed isn't large since it's meant to serve only 2 to 3 routes.</p>
              <p>one of the biggest reasons for coming up with this suggestion is that the feeder system is grossly ineffective in my opinion. the transit from train to bus (and vice versa) is around 5 minutes. exlcuding waiting time. total time needed from train to furthest stop of feeder is easily 10 or 11 train stops distance.</p>

              <p><br>if we dun have feeder bus system, for one there wun be last bus to match w/ e MRT and if we have 2 - 3 svs small terminals, chances are ppl would need to make countless transfers along main roads (a bigger bus - bus interchange system).</p>
              <p>Travelling time would end up longer</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Having multiple terminals will make passengers to transfer different buses and waste of time and fares. An integrated one stop bus interchange would be an important source of public transport, especially linking to the MRT Stations.<br><br>In fact, the suggestion (as per in the title thread) would be very well referring to the 1970s. Sometimes to make travel easier, SBS would implement the Rationalisation exercise to ease travelling time and to intergrate its services and cancel the duplicated ones. So indeed there's no need to built more bus terminals (especially for service with shorter routes).<br><br>Take a good example - Toa Payoh Town Centre Terminus (now known as Toa Payoh Bus Interchange)<br><br>All of its Toa Payoh services served and terminate at this terminus before a bigger interchange was built. It was well-organised at that time but its route then was quite circuitous until its Toa Payoh Bus Plan was unveiled in 1983, where all of its Toa Payoh Services were re-routed and shortened the time travelling around Toa Payoh and added 6 new feeder service (231, 232, 235, 237, 238, 239) to cover the affected routes used by the Toa Payoh Services that ply around Toa Payoh New Town Neighbourhood.<br><br>In fact, a sub-terminal built around Toa Payoh, would not be very effective, as there is only one bus interchange serving the estate.</p></div>

              <p>I think you are still unable to comprehend what are the benefits of a hub- and - spoke format. Instead of Point 2 point system which will cause a wastage of resources and a simply wastage of buses, BC/sl etc, a hub and spoke format is better, wanna go places that int no trunk, can x-fer at other interchanges, </p>
