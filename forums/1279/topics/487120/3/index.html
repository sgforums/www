              <p>Yishun temporary bus interchange looks so grand, cos it has many
              stalls. Altogether, it has 23 stalls, including 10 F&amp;B and 13
              shops. From what I know, it will open on weekends, either Saturday
              or Sunday. So, we randomly guess which date the temp will
              open.Â </p>
              <p>13 or 14 Dec</p>
              <p>20 or 21 Dec</p>
              <p>27 or 28 Dec</p>
              <p>So let's see whose guess will be correct when LTA will confirm
              the opening date.</p>

              <p>BSEP has already kept around 20 ADLs spare to be used for Yishun services. If its opening only in March, that's so much waste of resources and bad planning. LTA should have instead let SMRT take in those DDs for fleet upgrade and registered BSEP ones as latter part of the batch.</p>

              <p>You're right busanalyzer. It's consider a bad planning when Yishun Temp opens on March 2015. However, I just found out that the duration of constructing a temporary interchange should not exceed more than 8 months. If it's opening on Mar, means that the duration took 10 months, including 3 months extra to wait for the bus stop. Now, the bus stop have not even started constructing the structures. 3 months delay for the temp to open may sounds weird, cos other temps does not have this kind of situation before. Bedok Temp Int also want to have delays because their bus stop have not completed yet, but since it may took more than 8 months, they consider to open the Bedok Temp first while their bus stop is under construction. Yishun Temp might also open first, while waiting for the bus stop to complete.Â </p>
              <p>Previously I went to northpoint to look at the northpoint city, and I asked their people of when the Yishun Temp will be completed. They said latest will be Jan next year, but should not be March onwards, cos they will start construction for Yishun Hub by Feb next year. They say the temp int is constructed and will open as soon as possible, so the project will start early</p>

              Yishun Temp opens on March 2015. However, I just found out that the
              duration of constructing a temporary interchange should not exceed
              more than 8 months. If it's opening on Mar, means that the duration
              took 10 months, including 3 months extra to wait for the bus stop.
              Now, the bus stop have not even started constructing the
              structures. 3 months delay for the temp to open may sounds weird,
              cos other temps does not have this kind of situation before. Bedok
              Temp Int also want to have delays because their bus stop have not
              completed yet, but since it may took more than 8 months, they
              consider to open the Bedok Temp first while their bus stop is under
              construction. Yishun Temp might also open first, while waiting for
              the bus stop to complete.Â </p>
              <p>Previously I went to northpoint to look at the northpoint city,
              and I asked their people of when the Yishun Temp will be completed.
              They said latest will be Jan next year, but should not be March
              onwards, cos they will start construction for Yishun Hub by Feb
              next year. They say the temp int is constructed and will open as
              soon as possible, so the project will start early</p>

              <p>Buses started entering temp interchange for trial as early as Nov.. now its already two months.. maybe during the trial they found out some things were not right.Â </p>
              <p>Sometimes better to wait, make all the changes right and then open. Only sad thing is how LTA has kept the DDs SP for now 2 months without giving it to any service. I find that really stupid - shouldn't SMRT have registered first and upgraded its sinking fleet.Â </p>

              <p>Wow! They really keep the Enviros SP for 2 months without giving them to any service? No wonder I see so many Enviros with registered buses that I never seen them on service at Woodlands Park Depot. Well, they are for Yishun btw.</p>
              <p>Oh and also, the Yishun Temp looks like its going to open by this month I think since i see that they installed sign boards and services display. The entrances have also board display that might be for display as "Yishun" with the bus icon at the side.Â </p>

              <p>I also strongly feel by 3rd/4th week this month Yishun int has to open... they can't just keep the buses lying down that way... its ridiculous when SMRT needs it so much.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>They will announce the target date 10 days before the opening of Yishun Temp. E.g if Yishun Temp opens on 25 January, then LTA will announce it on 15 January. I do hope that Yishun Temp will open by this January, because it looks like the improvement fitting works at the bus bay area have completed and now, they putting on sign board directions and services display.</div>
