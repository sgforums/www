              <p>How BSEP is stubborn? BSEP is saving SMRT and its lack of high capacity buses. What do you prefer from BSEP to have A22 on 964 rather than E500? Seriously? How can you even call the trial failed? If it was SMRT that changed a bendy slot to DD, I would have agreed with your argument. But for a high loading service like 964 during peak hours you need high capacity buses.</p>
              <p>If this is your reasoning and you observe all JIS services and 78/79 in non-peak hours, you will not find many people. So SBST stupid to have all these services either full fleet DD or almost full fleet DD? </p>

              <p>855 can def have the 2 BSEP slots converted to DD. Loading justifies it. I will also prefer to see E500s on 860 than the A22s. When it comes to 856, I agree with you there is no need to introduce DDs on this service. There aren't enough, so let this be a full bendy service with 1 BSEP that can be DD.</p>

              <p>851 does not do very well with bendies. Always prone to congestion near Tiong Bahru. This is the reason it has lost so many bendy slots to SD. They should first do SD --&gt; DD and gradually Bendy --&gt; DD on this service. </p>

              <p>Yeah ok you are right, a DD on 964 would do better than an A22. But this is where I feel SMRT and LTA should come to terms and not have double standards.

              <p>I ride on 854 and 857 regularly. Yes SD is a no-go on 854 especially during peak hours. Non-peak still ok. I am sure BSEP will convert the 2 slots to DDs. SMRT side, I hope they convert another 2 SDs to high capacity too be it Bendy or DD. But with the number of MAN A22s SMRT has, i doubt this service will ever go 100% high capacity (Non-peak doesnt demand it too). But still priority to 857 to get DDs because it has no bendys at all. Did the weekend bendy slots disappear after closing of Bencoolen street because of the turns or issit because of the 857 berth too troublesome for bendy (last time even on weekends the bendys dont park there permanently- they drive in to board)? SMRT sure to have spare bendys from 184/964 for weekends mah. Though I highly doubt bencoolen street because DDs can turn. If I am not wrong I have taken a bendy on 857 even after the diversion</p>

              <p>I am speculating here... but i think they stopped bendy slot on weekends bcoz ppl might have complained to have it on weekdays also. and given it is a cbd, suntec bound service, it must be frustrating office-goers that sv 857 has bendy on weekends but not weekdays. So instead of giving bendies on weekdays also, smrt decided to just not give it any until it got DDs. As I said, this is my personal opinion.</p>

              <p>Yishun service that ought to get DDs from my personal observation is of course 851,Why?Simple..quite a numbers do take the service to Chinatown..Convert 9 slots including the 6 bendy duties to DDs might be a good start..5 full day and 4 split shift.</p>
              <p>Next is 854,Bendy buses prove to be a bane at Bedok Int thus you see many bendy slots are reduced..Can convert 14 SD/Bendy slots to DDs might be better..Gradually can convert another 4 SD slots to DD again if the A95 buses come..Off peak also can be packed..</p>
              <p>857 another clusterfark service,Weekdays only need 6 DDs the most,Weekends will be good if 3 full day and 2 TQ shift are running with DDs..Off peak demand dont justified for DD..</p>
              <p>860?Unless they extend it further else then justified for DDs if not stick with A24</p>

              <p>855 need meh? I would be interested to see how DDs fair on 860,
              after the failure on 964. BSEP very stubborn uh, still insist to
              keep that DD on 964. Honestly, 860 is better suited for Bendys but
              since its under BSEP, no choice. But is the route suitable to DDs
              in terms of the turns it has to make?</p>
              <p>For 856, its worth a try but IMO, no urgency unless its
              upgrading of BSEP SD slots. 856 has a majority bendy fleet now
              anyway, I would rather the DDs be used for SD--&gt; DD conversions
              than Bendy--&gt; DD conversions as far as the 201 ADLs are
              concerned. The O405G Habits are here to stay till atleast 2017
              (given they are being refurbished) so when the time comes, SMRT can
              explore doing do Bendy--&gt; DD conversion instead of a Bendy--&gt;
              Bendy conversion for 856.</p>

I believe LTA will be objective and buy the right type of buses in future when they have more depots and parking space. Wherever can use DD, LTA will surely choose DDs.

              <p>There will still be trunk services that experience high demand even when the DTL/TEL/CRL/JRL are operational. MRT lines cannot totally take over the roles of existing bus services.</p>
              <p>And with train service disruptions becoming more and more frequent nowadays, it is good to leave some trunk services which does not duplicate the MRT excessively around running as backups. High capacity buses need not be deployed for such routes on normal days, but when a train disruption occurs, high cap buses can be pulled to these semi-duplicating trunk routes to help out with the sudden increases in demand.</p>

Most MRT goers will board/alight at Admiralty and that's where you see even the bendies packed to door. At WRI, even bendies have ok loading because so many options to go along ave 7. </p>

              <p>It depends how routes are planned. For instance, if a person lives along Tampines Ave 5 and works at Macpherson road, he will still prefer to take sv 65 than take bus or walk to MRT, take DTL3 and then again walk/bus from Mattar or Geylang Bahru. </p>
              <p>So really depends how buses provide more point to point service. MRT lines and buses should complement each other, and not duplicate.</p>

              take over the fleet in future. I believe LTA will be objective and
              buy the right type of buses in future when they have more depots
              and parking space. Wherever can use DD, LTA will surely choose DDs.
              But there are bound to be services that are more suited for bendy
              and services that cannot use DDs. We will see what LTA does in
              future - but the fact is LTA cant do much now with its limited
              depot resources and LTA governs purchase of new bus models even now
              be they BSEP or non-BSEP.</p>
              <p>And FYI, there are close to 150 DD units that will retire after
              2017 (Batch 3 VO, VSO and Tridents)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am just merely saying Temasek Holdings (owners of SMRT) are not stupid. You wont expect them to be so short-sighted to just buy some 40 A24s for fun now and having a problem in 6-7years later. They are no small players in the market. They would have evaluated the decision thoroughly before making it.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>those A24 other than use for normal feeder also use in MRT train problems. but only 40 i think it too less should at 100. LTA should look into building BRT service for new HDB towns and upgrade inter town services. mean have bus lanes where no other transport can enter and the bus can skip traffic light at the main roads. LRT is no the right transport for HDB town feeder service. </p></div>
