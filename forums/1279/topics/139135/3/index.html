            <div class='col-md body'>I saw it once on 970, however I have not heard anything. I find it kind of stuipd if driver is required to say aloud the bus stop name.<br><br>Whether auto or manual, I will probably find the 'sound' more of a nuisance.<br><br>I still feel the 'display' thingy something stupid.<br><br>It may be slightly useful if the 'display' thingy tells the next stop, and not when it about approaching the bus-stop, and it started to display.</div>

The right sequence should be "Catholic JC, Trellis Towers, Aft blk 195, St Andrew's Jnr Sch, Kolam Ayer Ind Est, opp BLK16"and so on.</div>
