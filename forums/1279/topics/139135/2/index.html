Seems like some system bugs need to be ironed out.<br><br>The next stop location is updated on the LED screen, after the bus leaves the current stop. In particular, it's about 2-3 secs after the front readers changes from Entry/Exit to Entry mode. But I've found the updating may be quicker if the stops are in close proximity to each other.<br><br>Most wordings are in bold, those that can be squeezed on the screen without scrolling are un-bolded, and those that are longer are bolded and made into marquee-style.<br><br>It's better if they prefix "Next stop: ", makes the description more complete.<br><br>With this move, I think they have a better excuse to use less paper (those guides) and the decision to omit the location on the SMRT bus stop plates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

SBS has shown the bus stop name :" Opp. Blk 231 " etc. That one is good, it identifies the bus stop name and location. Yishun area formaly only has TIBS service, so the bus stop plates didn't show the name. But after service 39 introduced in Yishun, finally now the bus stop has the name printed.</div>
