            <div class='col-md body'>units in <strong>nearby Ayer Rajah Camp will move to Kranji Camp around 2006/7*</strong>. tis is due to the redevelopment of the One North region together with the opening of Queensway extension to AYE. re-zoning the land for commercial use seems practical considering the new road development nearby.<br><br>Gloucester Camp (a depot &amp; a small transport battalion) next to Ayer Rajah Camp can easily take over ARBP and use its facilities since it is a depot anyway. (you can see tis camp from AYE, Portsdown Rd bus stop). hence, the feasibility is there. also, ST Kinetics workshop, which also does heavy maintenance jobs for the army, has a gate at both Portsdown Rd and Ayer Rajah Ave, hence the vital maintenance link is not lost.<br><br>*only tis news is confirmed to be true.</div>

I swear 1698 was an ex-189 bus, since it had a small notice on the side telling interviewees for Svc Cpt positions to take 189 to BBDEP. It also had 1723 (previously AR 123, but ARBP is a sister depot). Both were deployed one after another. Don't tell me both were x-ferred to JRDEP?</div>
