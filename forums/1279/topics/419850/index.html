              <p>171 - no more bendy bus opeartions, only in history to b the 1st to b deploy on bendy</p>
              <p>980 - camero once in a while, compare to former 160 which hav more bendies during wkend.</p>
              <p>Wonder y SMRT don hav FIX bendy bus deployment for its svc, unlike SBS, full day/daily doubel decker operation despite lesser commuters in some period of the day/wk.</p>

              <p><br>Service 851 all these while had the same number of bendies even before and after OC500LE deployments. The perm OC500LEs on 851 only replaced all the rigids in 2009 (except TIB798P).</p>
              <p>For service 980, I would say that once in mid 2000s both AMDEP and WLDEP were generous enough to deploy about 7-9 bendies on Sundays. In the past service 160 had only 1 bendy doing only PM shift, sometimes 2 bendies. No more than that.</p>
              <p>For service 857 with lesser bendies, think AMDEP should high time train some of their drivers... Service 859 was indeed a bad move, all the bendies were withdrawn and replaced by CAC 0405s ever since WLDEP took in more 0405s from AMDEP in 2009.</p>

              <p><br>Rather, seems like service 980 had more bendies on sundays from WLDEP side ever since WLDEP took back 4 full duties from AMDEP since last Oct. Are those SLs formally from 857 (I believe those SLs from 852 are not trained in bendies at all)?</p>
              <p>I remember correctly that service 61 suddenly had a downgrade from bendies to rigids ever since Mar 2008 when WLDEP took over from KJDEP. And when KJDEP took back 61's duties from WLDEP last Oct, all the unassigned KJDEP OC500LEs went over to service 61 perm (which was slightly better compared to WLDEP with only 0405s).</p>
              <p>Perhaps service 61 was slightly better during SBST days, more ADDs could be deployed then.</p>
