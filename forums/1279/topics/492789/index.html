              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, but to bus lovers, it may not be a bad news. This may lead to more bus services being implemented as a important substitute. Bukit panjang bus interchange is also coming up very soon. If not wrong, end of this year right? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, we are discussing this topic because it is the latest transport news. I am afraid that you are not up to date with this. The authorities are discussing the various options as smrt has decided to find the best alternative. They are not demolishing it. </p>
              <p>Why is it in this forum is because there is this option of replacing it with feeder bus services. So this being a bus forum, we are talking about bus alternatives to this bukit panjang LRT.</p>
              <p>Seng Kang and Punggol are different cases as LRT is planned and built before the HDB flats. Thus they are very close to HDB flats and ridership is damn high. Bukit panjang is different case. LRT are built after flats are up. So land cannot be optimized to residents good effect. End up need connect 2 towns for higher ridership but still cannot capture enough ridership and lose money month after month. So your view of LRT being white elephant is not correct. Seng Kang has 2 cars LRT and Punggol will also have 2 cars LRT starting next yr. This speaks volume of high ridership. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, the last time I took for Bukit panjang LRT was before DTL came in operation. That time it was few people. Take note I was comparing against number of people at sengkang and Punggol LRT. Maybe that gives it a slightly tweaked impression. Thanks for highlighting that after DTL2, it was full of people. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, are you able to propose 3 routes to cover all the LRT stops and significant areas for bukit panjang LRT routes without affecting the other bus services currently operating around bukit panjang and cck? Should be chicken feed for you as you are the bus expert. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
