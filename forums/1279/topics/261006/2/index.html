Its too far they say. Just behind my block are 3 flats which were unoccupied for over 10 years (but not anymore). Even the local TV station came to make a story about it saying that they are haunted. The truth is they are not. You have more to fear of the living than the dead. Its a favourite haunt for drug addicts, rowdy youths and gangsters. Then, there is another cluster of blocks left unoccupied near the old Nanyang arch. Now with the newly built sports complex and upcoming MRT line, it has full occupancy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not every time la. I used to frequent that bus stop on my way to camp during NS. Many other NSFs do until the camp moved to new premises.  There are also people who alight there to go to the temple and the Soka building. Last time, the driver can happily filter right but now, they do that after they pass the bus stop; and very cautiously too bcos sometimes, a joker might want to board or alight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, spotted some abandoned HDB blocks there along Lim Chu Kang Rd while travelling on the old 925C route. It's pardon off as restricted area and a bangla estate was build opposite the road. Well, most likely to be an estate built in the 70's but I dun know why was it abandoned? I wonder Marina South have ghosts there. It seems to be an old hangout in the 80's but now, gangsters go there and bowl at King's Superbowl and some western drunkards go to the bars there. The viaduct below the superbowl seemed like a regular gang fight place to me. There's abandoned food court there as well. Why never tear it down and leave the ghost to nest up there? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by The_Bus_Guide:</div><div class="quote_body">I think I know which block of flats you are talking about. It is a cluster of about 7 blocks at the corner of Jalan Boon Lay and Jurong West Ave 4. It wasn't quite newly built. The flats were completed about 5 years ago and at that time, there was little demand for new flats. The flats are still unoccupied and I think these are the more bigger flats which people are not too keen of buying these days. The area is surrounded with a metal fence and the buildings are getting weathered down. There is moss, paint peeling off etc. Its creepy but I assure you they are not haunted.<br><br>Unoccupied blocks of flats are common in Jurong West. Not many people are keen to live here. Its too far they say. Just behind my block are 3 flats which were unoccupied for over 10 years (but not anymore). Even the local TV station came to make a story about it saying that they are haunted. The truth is they are not. You have more to fear of the living than the dead. Its a favourite haunt for drug addicts, rowdy youths and gangsters. Then, there is another cluster of blocks left unoccupied near the old Nanyang arch. Now with the newly built sports complex and upcoming MRT line, it has full occupancy.</div></blockquote>Same as the flats in SengKang and punggol.</div>

The flats there were never left vacant. There is another temple at Jurong West St 76, which is directly facing the vacant flats which I mentioned.</div>
