            <div class='col-md body'>(inspired by that route 82-Punggol-pontianak-ghost thingy...)<br><br>Has anyone experienced anything really out of the ordinary on board buses before, and which routes do you think have a high chance of encountering those... things?<br><br>For me, I have not encountered any ghostly incidents yet, but I believe I saw an UFO over Yishun from my bus a few years back  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  . I was on either route 858 or 969, and as my bus exited S.L.E., I spotted an orange light hovering over Yishun. When I got near Khatib station, I spotted a large, "+" shaped craft (with one of the axes longer than the other) with large spotlights and smaller blinking lights over us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  . Later, while waiting for my connecting bus to Sembawang at Block 740 Yishun Avenue 5, I saw the same orange light fly due east of me, in a northernly direction, before it simply disappeared.<br><br>As for likely bus routes where you might encounter "something"...<br><br>Route 82 - 'nuff said.<br>Route 157 - heard it passes by a newly built, but never sold, block of apartments in Jurong West...<br>Route 17 - heard that the area of Bedok it serves is haunted; I guess SBS Transit withdrew route 227 because there were too few people living there...<br>Routes 172 and 975 - Choa Chu Kang Cemetery. Enough said. Route 975 also goes down the last of lonely, countryside two-lane carriageways in Singapore - Lim Chu Kang Road - and I won't be surprised if somebody claims to see some flying saucer down there...<br>Route 29 - passes by the infamous Old Changi Hospital, the haunted commando camp, and the most "ulu" areas of Changi, which is said to be extremely haunted...<br>Routes 2 and 5 - goes by the Changi Prison, which I heard is not very "clean" either...<br>Practically every feeder route in Yishun - routes 804, 811, and 806 loops at the more isolated areas of Yishun, while routes 800 and 812 passes by Yishun Columbarium...<br>Routes 10, 30, 51, 143, and 200 - they all pass by Haw Par Villa, which is said to be haunted. Plus, ever try traveling by that place at night? The gate gives the area a sort of... unnatural, eerie, strange feel - try double-decker buses and you will know...<br>Route 174 - Old Jurong Road, you know? That "ulu" road parallel to the P.I.E.? There's apparently an abandoned cemetery down there...<br>Routes 138, 167, 169, and 980 - they all use the most "ulu" parts of Upper Thomson Road, and route 138 also goes to the Mandai area. Well, apparently, my father claims to have seen spirits in those forests in that area...<br><br>If you can think of any more bus routes that might be potential candidates, please post here.</div>

Thats the one . The one leading up a series of stairs right ?<br><br>That place is also near the dumping site of the statues . Go to Yahoo or Google and search pics of Haw Par Villa . Some paranormal investigators have taken pics of the dumped statues , and i tell you , the statue faces are eerily looking , as tho in an angry or upset manner .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Add 200 to that. It passes by Kent Ridge Park, which used to be a World War II Battle Ground. I must say that some of my friends spreaded rumours of ghosts when you blink at Novena MRT and Bishan MRT. I think it was crap but I just don't blink near there, just to be safe.<br><br>Well, 172 passes by 2 empty and haunted areas: CCK Cementery Area and Old Keat Hong Camp. The old Keat Hong Camp must be teared down. I heard some rumours that ghosts lived there. I think Service 82(obvious) will get scrapped. I think that the route should be shortened and terminate at Punggol Interchange or Sengkang just to be safe. Most people use 82 to get to Sengkang from Hougang.<br><br>Add all the services passing by the Stevens Road exit from PIE(Tuas) direction and you'll see an abandoned cementery. Also to take note of the old railway track along AYE(Keppel) after Jurong Town Hall Road Exit. Just take a double deck and turn to the left and you see them. A piece of them are still unremoved along Coporation Road heading towards Jurong Island after Coporation Flyover (PIE) and a railroad crossing sign is still there. I must confess that it looked spooky. Well, if you still don't understand, it was near the old Boon Lay Depot (1990-2001), which is now a JTC container park <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
