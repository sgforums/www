            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the destinations were taken out as they were to small to see from afar especially 3 digit services eg 196. It used to be listed as Clementi and Bedok.

            <div class='col-md body'>I also remember once when I was going to Woodlands from Jalan Kayu. I can take bus 168 or 858. However, while I was waiting for either of these two buses, bus 858 came and it said on the Hispanos that Woodlands interchange. In Jalan Kayu near the Seletar Camp, there are two bus stops. I was in the bus stop which it said that "Bus 168 and 858  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Woodlands" However, that particular bus 858 stopped at the other bus stop which is going to Changi Airport. That really made me confused. Later, another bus 858 came from Jalan Kayu flyover and then I realised that that bus 858 which stopped at the other bus-stop was heading to Changi Airport and apparently, the bus driver had forgotton to do something on the Hispanos.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">I prefer the TIBS displays on their Hispanos.</div></blockquote>There's a differentiation between TIBS[SMRT buses] and SBST. Firstly, SMRT buses have destos on the front because the buses left side only indicate the sv no. For SBST, only the front indicate the svc number coz on the left side it actually shows the destination it's heading and the roads it plies. Personally i think that SBST side desto plates are more beneficiary as passengers are able to confirm where they are going before boarding as the destos are normally near the entrance. For SMRT, you have to go to the front and wait for the info to flash.<br>However, SBST also have Electronic Destos on the front from their Dennis Tridents, VSO[SBS9810X], SBS997A,SBS998Y,etc</div>
