Besides that, Volvo improved the technology of building the Olympian chassis.<br><br>I don't think that SBST would buy in B7TL unless they would want something similiar to the VO 2 Axle. Looking at the size of the B7TL, it couldn't even fit in a 500KG air-conditioning system of a double decker bus. It still needs an additional axles at the back to support the weight of the air-conditioning system, which becomes B10TL in the end.</div>

Volvo buses have a characteristic which is heavy steering, the bus driver must TURN AND TURN AND TURN to get his front axle in the desired position while the other bus drivers who are lucky not to get Volvos can do it in one or two flicks of the hand.

Double decker buses do have heavy steering as the weight have the bus is really heavy. As a result, drivers tend to use 2 hands to steer the steering wheel.

However it is partly due to other factors and not necessarily steering, but it does play some part. For instance a driver who is used to a bus with hard steering transitions to one with lighter steering he may tend to misjudge and overturn, possibly losing control even.</div>
