Volvo buses have the same comfort as Leylands, to me Leylands are the kings of the road. They are the grandmother of superbuses in Singapore and let them do their work with grace, all right?</div>

Volvo buses have a characteristic which is heavy steering, the bus driver must TURN AND TURN AND TURN to get his front axle in the desired position while the other bus drivers who are lucky not to get Volvos can do it in one or two flicks of the hand. LO steering is heavy but not as bad as Volvos.<br><br>I like the farting when it changes gear, it is partly due to the gearbox, but that is what makes it my favourite, it is a characteristic and CANNOT be changed.</div>

Say what you like. My opinion will not make any difference to LO 3 axles anyway.</div>

What I'm doing isn't even bashing, it's throwing up of facts to substantiate my argument. You should be treasuring 3-axle LOs as they are the last batch of Leylands in the whole world.</div>

Without your 3-axle LO would there be the existence of your favourite VSO? NO! So you should be crediting the LO for the existence of the VSO. Otherwise we'd be all taking B7TLs and what-not.</div>
