              <p>The previous AOH was a tender based on per trip, Comfort Bus went in (sub some to SBST), they dint count any head, some buses were running full, some buses practically empty, towards the end, and you could still head to Pasir Laba at 6 pm (partly due to there being a few night activities). If its by head then, you think you can enter after 4 pm? TNC wouldn't want to gamble with potential not-so-full trips after 4pm whereby they may not even recover the cost of having the buses running. Comfort was able to make do with empty trips as they are paid for the trips, instead of being shortchanged.</p>

              <p>Cos, as I said before, TNC won't want to run buses with even one less passenger, cos the buses are not theirs (they have, I believe, no buses themselves for hire at all) and they have to pay the respective operators for the trips they run. Those operators charge TNC per trip, while TNC charge SAF per head, so TNC has no choice but to fill up all the seats. Private bus operations in Singapore is not as simple as you think.</p>

              <p>The tender this time round is NOT by Trips. <br><br>SAF gives out the tender stating the number of expected crowd that they would be expecting everyday during the Open House. <br><br>Bus companies would then tender for it by stating how many buses they would be deploying on the different days and how much. <br><br>The staffs at the different departure points are counting the number of ppl departing is actually for admin purposes. So that they can actually decide if they shld grab any additional buses or they shld take out extra buses. Its actually up to them. At the same time, they record down the rego so as to have better control over the buses. As this time round, the tender went out to TNC and the buses belongs to different co. by recording down the departure timings and rego would ensure that they bus drivers do not wander off somewhere else.</p>
