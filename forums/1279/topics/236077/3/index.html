            <div class='col-md body'>Oftenly ppl like MS who are working in the respective company feel non chalent abt the situation and event. They will try to be objective but in a way defend their own group of ppl because they don't understand the pain and the over effort made by the consumer. Verbal form maybe! actual side NO(unless they experience b4).<br><br>Imagine this incident happen to himself, and all of us plainly pin point our finger at him. Not a gd idea right? In fact the problem lies with the driver they trained. I can say only partially of them are the problematic case. EVEN if they do have the authority to confiscate any cards or whatever, they should be courtesy enough to take a couple of seconds to explain to the consumer. At least this give the situation more space to communicate.<br><br>So i believe picking out of all this driver(as in give warning, any action taken or etc) is definitely necessary for the customer service standard to improve. Minimise rather than tolerant such cases.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br></div>

I nvr say that they cannot continue to use their cards.

However, emotions aside but the fact is that after the concession validity, you are required to pay your bus fare in full adult fare, not the normal 55 cents. By paying 55 cents when your card isnt valid is actually an abuse of the system. I believe your friend know that her concession validity expired and she herself is no longer a student, so why pay 55 cents?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by ice_jas:<strong><br>and well, i just met with this incident recently when my easylink card ran out of money and apparently i paid 55cents out of norm. the uncle demanded me to tap the card n i tapped.

That's because you initially put 55 cents in the coin box. Even if you top up to 90 cents is useless. The fact is, you abused the system.<br><br>Dont ask me why but some drivers are like that though i never encountered any driver who kindly let you top up to 90 cents and let you off. If such drivers do exist, wouldnt that increase the possibility of you cheating another 55 cents on another trip?<br><br>So guys, next time if you want to play cheat, drop 55 cents first and see if the driver would demand to see your ezlink card. If never, you lucky. If got, then give a stupid excuse like "oh yah i not student le" and guai guai top up to 90 cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> DONT show your sec/jc ezlink card!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by ice_jas:<strong><br>To students who Don't bring I/C around, isn't this ezlink card with a photo and i/c number equivalent to a i/c? and should we give our 'i/c' to anyone just like that if they demand for it? what if something happens and we need an easylink card to verify our identification? this is such an inefficient way of 'updating' the system. why not they just 'lock' the card and says that i'm supposed to go to some stations to register and to unlock otherwise i can't use my card?<br><br>Confiscation of bus card/normal fare card or what is not as problematic as confiscation of a student's pass.

You wont die though i understand younger people tend to lose the i/c easily that's why they revised the age from 12 to 15.<br><br>As for locking the ezlink card, it actually would lead to greater costs in producing an adult ezlink card just for you when your current card can actually function as one. As you know now the first generation ezlink cards are expiring soon and they are trying to extend the validity of the adult ezlink card so that the company would not waste resources to replace them unnecessarily.<br><br>I hope you understand what i've just said.
