            <div class='col-md body'>Blame yourself that your card is corrupted in the first place. Theres no one to blame.. For your OWN infomatin if you do not know, most cases, corrupted cards are cause by the user itself.. Not the system. And, have you ever know why the reason why the BC wants to keep your card ? Have you ever thought of it before you come in here and make noise ? The reason that the BC does it is to prevent people from farecheat. This is all thankz to alot of the O Lvl students.. They alwayz show their bus card and pay student fare when they are not allowed to do so. It is the company policy to keep the cards that are expired. Ask yourself.. Did the Ezlink reader show Card Expired or Card Error ? If they have shown "Card Error" then the BC got no right to take your card. But at that point of time.. the reader was shown "Card Expired". This way, i dont blame the BC for trying to confiscate your card when it is the company policy to do so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well all I can say SBST has a company policy.  There's nothing commuters can do about that.<br><br>As to others who are quick to criticise the thread starter by shouting one whole list of questions, and try to act smart, sarcastic and self-righteous (though obviously you are not), you obviously fall flat.  Nothing more than just a more hollow vessel making a louder noise **yawns**<br><br>As to some XXX company personnel, your comments are definitely biased.  It would be inappropriate for someone working in a one department to comment on the operations of another department.<br><br>And if you had read what the thread starter, he did pay his fare.  He did not cheat on his fare.  The driver should have just advised the thread starter to take the card to Transitlink.

The catch is, the concession only works with a valid monthly stamp affixed. Otherwise, full adult fare will have to be paid. There is a limit to the extent of the help offered. Otherwise, the people will get too 'pampered' or 'try to take advantage of the system'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the thread starter should clarify the matter with the relevant authorities. We as consumers will "by right automatically" protect our own rights, but the companies have their own rules and regulations. In most of the cases, we still have to take public transport, unless private transportation is available.<br><br>If the thread starter is still feeling sore about the incident, he can sought help from Transitlink or PTC.

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel very disgusted with the belligerent replies with this thread, which are obviously are unbalanced, reeks of intolerance and uninformative. So I am going to air my views.<br><br>First and foremost, to the threadstarter.<br><br>I am sorry to hear your side of the coin. It is indeed a very nasty experience, which affected you adversely in terms of your mood, etc. Nonetheless, I encourage you to fight for your own rights! If you feel the need to, I would support you to complain to authorities! However, do note that when you are complaining, please do not be overly opinionated, emotionally-swayed. Be objective. Be clear of what you want to say. Try to type the letter as maturely as possible. That would help you in achieving your objective.<br><br>As for you trying to get back your money, apart from wishing you the best of luck, i would advise you to be FIRM, explain explicitly what happened, and why you would want a refund (based on your reasons). If they give you some half-hearted reply, complain to their manager. So long as your story is true, reason is on your side. So you got to fight for such an unjustified injustice which was done to you!<br><br>Best of luck!<br><br>Secondly, to MS.<br><br>First and foremost, I understand that you are working in SBS Transit. Henceforth, it would be understandable that you would be speaking for SBS Transit. And so, as a result, your views on certain issues may be one-sided. So far, after looking through your comments, I have to agree that even though they are not emotive, they are unbalanced. But I do understand your position and your limitations.<br><br>Secondly, I am quite put off by the phrase "student fare is not an entiltlement" and "You have to acknowledge that if one day the companies decided to withdraw this privilege &amp; make everyone pay adult fare you still have to pay it. " Such statements reflect very badly on SBS Transit.<br><br>The reason why there is concession pass is to make travelling more affordable for students, who are not financially stable. You may like to argue that SBS Transit is a private company and so all rights are reserved, etc etc etc. However, you fail to understand that the primary priority of a bus company is to transport commuters from one place to another, not to earn big bucks. Your statements are suggestive that the bus company is king, which is entirely not true. For your information, where does the bus company gather its profits from? The commuters. If there are no commuters, would you be needed? Would the buses be needed? NO. Right, so please donÂ’t say until SBS Transit is being so benevolent by giving concessions, etc. Try withdrawing the concession and see how the society would react. Do not undermine society pressure.<br><br>You may also like to face the brutal truth that if the commuters are not happy, and should they boycott public transport as a result, your rice-bowl would be smashed. Same goes for the bus company itself. If the bus company doesnÂ’t want to give bus concession, they can just withdraw it, just see what the commuters can do. Thus, I would advise to rephrase your phrases! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now to SBS_Boy<br><br>I think the one to be blamed here is you. It may sound uncouth, but shame on you for lack of empathy and understanding towards others! You commented that Â“For your OWN infomatin if you do not know, most cases, corrupted cards are cause by the user itself..Â”. Okay, this is true. But please, what about the other cases which are not in the Â“most casesÂ”? Who is the one to be held accountable for the corrupted cards? Commuters? Tsk. Tsk. And I would suggest that you ought to rephrase your sentence, because you could had easily omitted out certain words, such as Â“For your OWN informatin*Â” which would made other people think that you are giving a lecture. You just conveniently avoided the fact that the poor thread starter is currently facing with such an unpleasant incident, and that he had to pay adult fare, even though he was given the concession, and yet just go on with your preaching. JEEZ. Have you ever thought of the thread starter point of view before you start your lecture? The anxiety of going everywhere without an ez link card, the trouble he/she has encountered just to get back his card, the amount of time spent in trying to get his card back, his feelings? No, you didnÂ’t. So there.<br><br>I am sorry if I had inadvertently hurt people in the process of commenting, but I feel that the comments which youÂ’ve made would be very hurting to the thread starter. On a side note, I feel that the bus drivers should be more professional in handling such cases in the future. Looking at the current situation, I am not very pleased at how bus drivers handle such cases. The bus driver should CONVINCE the passenger to hand over the card, and not to Â“trickÂ” or lure , be it directly or indirectly, the passenger to hand over the ez link card. It is extremely infuriating and is being seen as a barbaric act. Furthermore, it is definitely not going to a pleasant experience for passenger, the bus driver and the bus company. So I hope the bus company could come up with alternative methods to eradicate (or lessen) such incidents from happening again in the future.<br><br>Thank you for reading my point of view. =)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I am afraid that some of you here have failed to grasp the importance of my message. And I say this not because I work in a public transport company but as a person who values integrity &amp; understanding of the truths.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Earning big bucks &amp; mainintaining good service</strong></span><br>Being private operators, the companies are responsible of maintaining their own profits. And yes. the main objective is to earn money and maintain the company afloat to keep everyone aboard. At the same time, the shareholders', employees interests must be taken into account. Therefore it is a balance between keeping a reasonable service to commuters &amp; maintaining a profitable income. <strong>Therefore it is both about earning big bucks and operating a proper service for the commuters. This you all have to acknowledge.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recognition of the good service providers</strong></span><br>And yes, the commuters can always opt to take private transport if you are too pissed with public transport &amp; want to smash my ricebowl because the personal transport is always there. I initially thought the same way when I first took my licence in 1998. I was on my own personal transport ever since I got my 1st licence until I entered this industry in 2005. Even until now, I am partially on my own transport &amp; partially on public transport. The reason I refuse to sell my own personal transport is not that I find public transport lousy. But it's because of my personal passion for automotives. Because, the public transport companies like any big companies are massive in headcount. There will always be black and white sheeps in the company. And I acknowledge that every single day there are fantastic people who're trying their best to provide the best of the best services they can offer &amp; there will always be black sheeps making life like hell for the customers. Because of this, I acknowledge the presence of the good employees even though I am not served with one &amp; respect all their company policies regardless it's public transport, supermarkets, shopping centers. etc<br><br>If by any case I am unhappy with the service, I will properly write into the management focused at the problem and refraining from unnecessary slanderous remarks. This is done to keep my integrity on my part &amp; respect for those people who have done their best.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Concession Fares</strong></span><br>I find that some of you have been taking concession fares for granted. The real reason why concession fares stays is because the transport companies are ready to take care and help those who're in need.<br><br>Some of you may want to take note that:<br>(1) concession fares remain despite the recent need to fare hike to keep the companies' financial health.<br>(2) despite the hikes, the elderly concessionary timings were extended.<br>(3) A huge amount of money was donated out to help those needy families. If you feel that you qualify as a real needy family member, you can always feel free to contact your CC, MP to apply for the transport allowance. This amount of money was hugely donated by the transport company.<br><br><strong>The concession fares are deducted from the pockets of the transport companies to give those weaker financially people to help them continue to use the public transport &amp; not resort to walking. Hence every single cent given as concession must be well justified &amp; ensured that every single cent goes to the right person. Because there will always be people that abuse this concession. So by being stringent in executing the concessionary fares policies, it makes the continuation of concessionary fares with a good companies' financial health possible.</strong><br><br>Some of you may also want to take note that:<br>(1) Abuse of concession are one of those reasons in the fare hikes.<br>(2) Concession fares are not an entitlement but a previledge given to those truely in need.<br>(3) No amount of society pressure can stop the transport companies from withdrawing the concessionary fares if the companies want to or need to. Because there is no law in this country that binds the transport companies to give. However you can be very sure that the 2 companies will never do that unnecessarily because there must be acknowledgement that there are always needy families out there who appreciate the efforts given to make concessionary fares possible.<br>(4) PTC is here to regulate the financial input &amp; service output is balanced &amp; reasonable. Therefore it will not be able to abuse their rights by making out of the world demands<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The real needy &amp; those not</strong></span><br>This is a personal thinking that I think all should subject yourself to. When you think back, do you actually think you deserve the concessionary fares? Some of you here have hands and legs, parents are still in working condition. You still have the finincial capabilities to be pushed through educations from Primary to Secondary and some to tertiary or university. But there are those who have no parents to take care. No money to study or even have to basic mental health to study. There are those who have no limbs. There are those who have been unable to find a job to maintain his family yet he never gives up and was willing to snap any job offer that comes his way. There are so many of those who're really in need of help and ultimately become <strong>liabilities unwilliningly! Yet some of them are paying normal adult fares willingly! Some refused to be pitied and looked down. Therefore I have utmost respect for those who're incomplete physically, emotionally yet earn their own living.</strong><br><br>And we have people who are far more better but just happen to fit a general category to claim concessionary fares making noise over a little mishap by black sheeps. Or even talking about justice and rights when they have inverted the way it works! Or people who threaten with society pressure that concessionary fares is like something they deserve. Or even some who think that they deserve more when there're plenty of people out there who truely deserve more assistance <strong>yet refused!</strong><br><br><strong>Be more matured in handling matters. Be someone who takes care and not be taken care. And here we have 2 companies who have ploughed into their own pockets to make a lifelong commitment to help the public despite having to remind themselves all day long that they have a profit to maintain.</strong><br>Have you done your part?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br>I sincerely hope that my long post has helped you all to understand the stand taken on concessrionary fares &amp; not blame bus captains for confiscating any concessionary cards. You can always write in to get back your money's worth. On top of that, you can always ask for compensation money that reasonably exceeds your cards' worth. I hope I have explained the true justice &amp; explained who's rights are infringed here. Therefore I would advise that if anyone of you are not sure of situations, please refrain from shooting off. It will only reflect badly on your character.<br><br>I have said my piece. If anyone of you are unhappy and want to flame me with immaturity, I apologise in advance for ignoring you.<br><br>Also thanks to those people who understand the stand I have taken to protect those who truely need.</div>

In my view, the true quality workshop service is zero breakdown stats yet I still don't burst budget. But I am not God, so I will never be able to be perfect. Neither can my colleagues.<br><br>However you cannot deny that every single day there're people who're doing their very best to bring out the best service to the public.<br><br>Likewise, when I went to Autofrance, I respect the sales rep and only make reasonable demands for freebies. So that I balance the income of Autofrance at the same time justify the money I pay. You'd not be surprised. If you respect the service provider, the service provider will be so obligated to serve you better.<br><br>Or when I called Mcdonald's for an order, I'd greet the person who picked up the phone "Hi good evening." The person over the end of the line hurriedly greet back and was extremely courteous throughout the entire transaction.<br><br>The bottomline is fairness &amp; respect. If the bugger who served you gave you rubbish when you showed him respect, you have a clear conscious when you feedbacked his poor service to his boss to ask for compensation.<br><br>A good deal does not need to be a deal where you get the best and everything. A good deal is a fair deal whereby needs are met at both ends with no one abusing any of the loopholes. This applies to all the customer service oriented industries inclusive of the concession fares issue.<br><br>I hope you understand.</div>
