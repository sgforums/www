You wont die though i understand younger people tend to lose the i/c easily that's why they revised the age from 12 to 15.<br><br>As for locking the ezlink card, it actually would lead to greater costs in producing an adult ezlink card just for you when your current card can actually function as one. As you know now the first generation ezlink cards are expiring soon and they are trying to extend the validity of the adult ezlink card so that the company would not waste resources to replace them unnecessarily.<br><br>I hope you understand what i've just said. If you still have any queries feel free to reply.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>yes i know that it's kinda abusing the students' priviledge by putting in the 60cents but you must understand it kinda slip the mind sometimes. alright i shalln't try to shift my resposibilty though haha.<br><br>yeaa bringing i/c out is what im doing now until i get my card back. the point is that people bring ezlink card(students) because they are afraid of misplacing or losing the i/c what. just trying to make a point that, it just brings inconvenience to everyone. I'm trying not to travel during this period w/o the card. oh well i never got an adult card before so no point getting one while my card is being confiscated. perhaps i will use my mum's. Just to add on, using my student's ezlink card doesnt mean that im paying fares at students' rate. im still paying adults' what. -__- alright.<br><br>and to lock the card means that the system can juz install some code into the card and upon registering at some stations they will uncode it? oh well just an suggestion though <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> thnx for replying la.</div>

As a private commercial company, the main priority is to increase profits. If the extra efforts do not reap in the profits then why should the company be obligated to do. They are not charitable orgainsations nor government bodies. The local public transportation industries in my view is an industry operating in perversed manners. This is because the companies are actually limited by the government to make more profits. A good illustration is like placing a ceiling over a child rendering it unable to have a healthy growth.<br><br>I am quite sure that many of you posting here do not have actual corporate experience in the management level therefore unable to see the macro view.<br><br>In response to this problem, the public also have an option, if you're unhappy with the public transport industry, you can alway opt for your own transport. A bike or a car, after a balanced comparison, you'll find that all 3 have their own pros and cons. And of course you get what you pay. If you're unable to get your own transport, then you can only blame yourself for being weak. Though harsh, this is the fact how the game is played.</div>

According to the Conditions, despite the payment of card cost for any ez-link card purchased, all ez-link cards remain the property of EZ-Link Pte Ltd. Furthermore, the ez-link card must be produced at any time for inspection by any authorised personnel of EZ-Link Pte Ltd, the transport operators or qualified merchant. In addition, the Conditions entitle them to retain any ez-link card, which it reasonably suspects or has reason to believe to have been fraudulently issued, stolen, tampered with or misused. Hence, the bus captain has the clear contractual right to retain an ez-link card once the above circumstances are met.<br><br>We thank Mr Lo for sharing his feedback and hope we have addressed his concerns.<br><br>Kathryn Lau (Ms)<br><br>Assistant Corporate Communications Manager<br><br>TransitLink</div>

He den deducted off $0.63 my ezlink card and tried to confiscate it. He then force me to pay 90cent in order to get tix. I refused. I complained to SBST and tried to kick a fuss in the bus. Commuters were shocked. SBS9806J and I tried to get card back and yes we did in the end. Stupid responses after 2weeks of pestering them for a response, they finally gave us TWO complimentary tix.

(better, but not fantastic service. it still isnt the best service) steal all the LO3x and in the end, turn SP (Sigh)<br><br>AND if u notice from the SBST website, the complains are mostly from buses controlled by brbp/amdep buses.<br><br>However, i am shocked a Sv 65 BC did this too this guy who started this thread. i am a regular 65 commuter and pay cash on off. one BC from arbp (the rotten egg of the AR side) and one BC from the bndep side (the rotten egg of the BN side) checked my pass.<br>On the whole Sv 65 BC's are quite good, esp the arbp ones.

I must say that SBST is tight on fare evaders nowadays, plus drivers usually get strict when they know they have a regular check by TI. Now ask you one question, which is more important, your card or the driver's bonus? Also, last time JIS dint check, now very strict.<br><br>Analogy: If you get a very bad scolding by a teacher and have so many other teachers teaching you other subject treating you nicer, then you most probably would hate the teacher.

Commuters of course looked shocked cos you are holding up the bus and thus delaying  the BC's schedule (and probably woke them up from their nap too). Even more reason for the BC to hold on to your card as an independent observer. The BC, or SBST/Transitlink doesn't give a hoot if the card was only made an hour ago if he suspects the card to be invalid.<br><br>Count yourself very lucky for SBST to compensate you with 2 complimentary tix as a gesture of goodwill - they don't have to as stated in the official reply posted by sbs_boy earlier. And you in fact still made a nice profit from this episode as the value of the 2 complimentary tix is definitely more than 60 (or is it 63 cents)!</div>
