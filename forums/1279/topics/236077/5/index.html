Whether he choose to eject the pax or make him pay the non concession fare is a different issue.<br><br>As Scania has pointed out correctly, the only official document recognised by law in Singapore for peeps without a NRIC card is the birth certificate (in the case for minors). Passport is of course also acceptable if one has it but has to be supported by the BC in certain cases (need to check on this one).<br><br>One can easily tell that the ez-link card is not an official document simply because it is not issued and controlled by a government ministry / stat board.  Instead the card is issued and the terms of conditions of usage set by ez-link pte ltd which is still recognised as a private entity.<br><br>As stated in my previous post, please read up and open your eyes to observe.<br></div>

There is a difference between a national transport system &amp; a public transport system; SMRT &amp; SBST are both privately held companies that derives its earnings on fare revenue and does not get government grants for its operations. So as private companies of course it has the choice to engage another private company to manage its fare collection system.<br><br>Get MOE out of the concessionary card system? I'm sure that the operators would be more than happy to support the move as it would mean more fare revenue; afterall they are not bound at all to provide concessions!<br><br>There is also the logistics &amp; operations associated, ie the production of new cards, maintenance of systems, co-ordination &amp; disbursement of the fare revenue associated with ez-link. In these days even the IT department of government ministries is outsourced as its much more efficient. Thus its not as easy as one thinks to just set up a government board to manage travel cards.<br><br>I don't even see that there is a need for competition - one must be mad to have one as the main advantage of a travel card is that of convenience, which means one card to pay for different modes of travel across different companies. Another company = another fare collection system = another set of readers = another card to carry around = increased inconvenience.</div>

Did the Ezlink reader show Card Expired or Card Error ? If they have shown "Card Error" then the BC got no right to take your card. But at that point of time.. the reader was shown "Card Expired".

Concession pass holders simply bought stamps and paste on the student pass. Its actually the same in the past; BCs &amp; inspectors have the right to demand to see the student pass when they suspect misuse and it can be confiscated too - I have mine confiscated before cos my face didn;t really match the photo btw and it caused some inconvenience getting it back. It was also permitted as the card was issued by TransitLink, not MOE alone. The student pass like the current ez-link could also be used to borrow library books etc.<br><br>However back then, in my opinion students didn;t make a lot of noise cos the concession still remains, they could simply continue using the card as long as another suspicious BC/TI demands for their student pass, for which they could just claim ignorance and pay adult fare for that one trip alone.<br><br>The student pass/national ID is USELESS when it comes to verification during important events such as national exams. I recall vividly that my teacher stressed over and over again that ez-link card is not accepted during the GCE exams - its NRIC or one has to find the chief examiner and beg her to sign a slip to act as a temp ID. It is also definitely not accepted to gain entry into important installations such as MINDEF (it used to, and was promptly stopped when it was discovered that it may pose a security lapse).<br><br>There is the official NLB library card to borrow books in lieu of the ez-link card (or student pass back then) and its issued free of charge. I'm sure that there is an alternate way to access school systems in lieu of the barcode as its a pretty unreliable method of authentication, its just that the students might find it a hassle to approach the relevant teacher in charge and so claim that ez-link card is the 'only' way.<br><br>Nobody said about bringing that huge laminated piece of paper called a BC around everywhere and everytime - its only on specific occassions where one is informed beforehand that it is required.<br><br>Thus it is in my personal opinion that confiscation of the card doesn't really affects the life of students that much, its just that most are disgruntled at having to pay adult fares until the card is returned to them.<br><br>The identification function as I explained earlier is limited and there are alternatives available. It would also take like at most 2weeks for it to be returned and not months. It is also hard for MOE as a government ministry to issue such peripherals which is best handled by a seperate company in partnership. (I can vouch that there is a heck lot of costs etc alone in setting up a new card production centre as it isn;t as easy as just printing, pasting and issuing).<br><br>In addition, I didn't even mention anything about the Straits Times, so don't assume and put words into my mouth. Papers could mean everything from The Sun to Wall Street Journal. Factual reporting is in my opinion better than ungrounded and unsupported online articles, and commentaries aren't what newspapers are for - they are merely a side.<br><br>I don't work for the public transport sector either; I just don't see the logic behind your reasoning and your horribly flawed interpretation of terms. The *ouch* of having to paying adult fare asides, I don't really see how the confiscation of a "national" ID have so much impact on student's lives.</div>
