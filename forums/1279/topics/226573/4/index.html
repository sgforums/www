Since it now seems like Jurong West Avenue 3 is completed (since 185 can pass through Jurong West Ave 3 to Jurong West St 24 (which till recently is still not completed) and then Street 23,) then how will 181 U Turn?</div></blockquote> the junction for 185's turn is before 181 loop area... so 181 go straight through the junction to the dead end then make a turn back... got it?</div>
