            <div class='col-md body'>ya; got poor old folks AND there are also plenty of elderly who are loaded with $$$ and yet receiving concessions le. my suggestion is to raise senior citizen concession age entitlement in line with govt policies but also rendering help to those who are really in need (those 60yrs and above); just like the public transport fund. furthermore, most senior citizens got kids who are grown up and working and contributing allowances to them. they can start withdraw their CPF to cushion their costs of living but at the same time work at reduced pay to kill time and earn some money. their desire for money is still not as great as working adults with families.<br><br>in time to come, the ratio of working adult to elderly will increase significantly due to aging population. With the need to subsidise for child/student/senior citizens, be expected to foot a much higher adult fare to cross-subsidise them. and what about working adults with low salary and struggle to feed their kids and pay their HDB installments, daily expenses? the public transport fund is not enough to cover their travel burdens.<br><br></div>
