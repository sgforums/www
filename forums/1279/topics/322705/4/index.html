              <p>Small break down of SMRT duty codes (shifted due to off topic in prev post):</p>
              <p>AM/PM - A/P shifts.</p>
              <p>S1/S2 - Split shifts, like fellow folks who stated earlier, S1
                                                  is normal spilit shift, S2 is E shift.</p>
              <p>TQ - Three quarter shifts, or T shift.</p>
              <p>Normal shift numbers usually range from 01-30 plus. Have not
                                                  encountered 40 yet. Any shift of the above that has 50 and on would
                                                  mean cross-over shift in general. However, shifts which contains
                                                  cross-over can be numbered in the 01-30+ range as well.</p>
              <p>Examples:</p>
              <p>189AM02 - 189 block 02, flip over, there is 189PM02.</p>
              <p>189S101 - 189 block 08 (in this case, s189 has 7 full day
                                                  buses), its a S shift.</p>
              <p>189S201 - 189 block 10 (if still accurate), its an E (extended)
                                                  shift.</p>
              <p>189TQ01 - 189 block 08, Sundays only, its a T shift.</p>
              <p>190AM50 - 190, with cross-over to s307 in the morning, flip
                                                  over, there is 190PM50 and full of s190 trips plus one downroute
                                                  (if still accurate).</p>
              <p>962S252 - 962, with morning crossover to s963 for half trip, off
                                                  service back to Woodlands Depot, then afternoon is full of s962
                                                  trips.</p>
              <p>Example of crossover but not 50 series:</p>
              <p>189S103 - 189 block 11 (if still accurate), crosses over to s77A
                                                  for one trip.</p>
              <p>106S103 (Disused) - 106, with cross-over to s77A for one
                                                  trip.</p>
              <p>I find that few folks do SMRT timesheet, of course service_238 does SBST ones...</p>
              <p>I kind of interested in doing SMRT ones... Hehx, still lots to learn...</p>

              <p><br>Just wanna ask you ah.. How they integrate the duty 5x with the normal A/P or split shifts and how will their block number reflect?</p>
              <p>Since you have said about SMRT, I shall talk about SBST.. This way if anyone else wants to ask regarding duty codes just refer to our 2 posts.</p>
              <p><a title="Dual Depot Duty Code Arrangement" href="/forums/1279/topics/322705?page=3#post_8405486">Dual Depot Duty Code Arrangement</a></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SBS Transit Duty Codes </span></strong></p>
              <p>For SBST, each duty code is unique in such a way that in a service, whether single or dual depot, you would not find the same duty number or same block number within the service.</p>
              <p>A/P: Basically AM shift and PM Shift. By which A shift takes precedence over P shift in terms of the duty number.</p>
              <p>E.g. 1A S238, take out the other timesheet that's with the driver (238 timesheets are double sided) is 6P. There are 5 full day buses that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">park at the depot</span> (238 has overnight parking)</p>
              <p>Some services have more P shift than A shift (and vice versa but that's rare). Henceforth, the duty no for the additional P shift will be after all the buses and duties that are A/P.</p>
              <p>E.g. 7P S238 Sat/Sun schedule meaning there are 3 full day buses that run A/P park at the depot, while 7P runs P shift only.</p>
              <p>S: Split shift equivalant to SMRT's S1 duties. Duty numbers will take after all the A/P shift of the same depot. (dual depot cases refer to the above URL in my post). If u know all the S shifts of the service, you would notice that they are arranged in a certain pattern (same for A shifts when they start in the morning)</p>
              <p>E.g. 29S 30S S174 Wkday 1st trip starts in the direction towards boon lay (29S start at Ch of St Mary, 30S at NBR - of which 29S is in front of 30S by bus order). 31S-32S 1st trip starts in the direction towards NBR (31S at Conoration Pl, 32S at Boon Lay - of which 31S is in front of 32S by bus order)</p>
              <p>E: Extended shift - another type of split shift (equivalant to SMRT's S2 duties). Duty numbers will take after the S shifts. Since there are far few E shifts than S shifts esp for wkdays, the way in which they label the duty number is not significant enough to see a pattern. There is a pattern for services with alot of E shifts.</p>
              <p>E.g. There is only 1 E shift for S3, S90, S131 for weekdays, not enough to see a pattern. However there are more than 1 E shift for S157, S153, S155</p>
              <p>T: Three-quarter shift, and no it doesnt mean work 6 hours out of 8 hours. It basically means a day shift that exceeds the change shift time of an A shift.  Duty numbers take after the E shifts. If there are many T shifts (especially weekends), there's a pattern as to which range of duties start from one terminating point and which range starts from the other terminating point.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timing Reference Notes</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li>There is no limit to the start times of A, S, E, T shifts in the morning </li>
              <li>P shift is classfied as a shift that runs after 2030hrs. Start time is restricted to after 1230hrs.</li>
              <li>A shift changeover to P shift time range is 1230-1630hrs. If the A shift has no P shift, the bus has to reach the depot by 1630hrs.</li>
              <li>E shift is classified as a shift that reaches the depot <strong>BEFORE </strong>1000hrs after its morning trip, and takes the bus before 1400hrs for its afternoon trips. It is compulsary for E shifts to have a mid-late afternoon meal break.</li>
              <li>S shift is classified as a shift that is generally outside the E shift requirements. However, there are some S shifts that have meal breaks especially if they reach depot between 1130-1300hrs after their morning trips. There are also S shifts that have meal breaks (like an E shift) midway thru their afternoon trips. The latter are rare occurances.</li>
              <li>T shift is classified as a shift that reaches the depot <strong>AFTER</strong> 1630hrs.</li>
              <li>S and E shifts for basic services are required to reach the depot <strong>BY</strong> 2030hrs on any day. There is no restriction for Basic Plus Services due to their nature of operation.</li>

              <p>So far from what I understand of the block numbers is that AM/PM shifts always come first, then the S1 or TQ shift in either case. S2 should be sandwiched in between. 5X series should be occupying the last few blocks of AM/PM or S/TQ if applicable. Normally they do not have TQ in weekdays and Saturdays, although S2 might be used on Saturdays.</p>
              <p>Like s189, for weekdays, there are 7 plus 4 buses. Saturdays have 7 plus 1 (S201), then Sundays have 7 plus 1 (TQ).</p>
              <p>Some of the points different from SBST I guess are the shift numbers, due to the nature that AM and PM shifts are holding the same number. Majority control depot would have their shift numbers on the smaller side. Taking s61 for example, AM has AM/PM01-11, WL (formerly KJ) has AM/PM12-22. AM leads WL by one split shift.</p>
              <p>TQ would start normally earliest at 0800hrs, and end roughly 9-10 hours later. The earliest TQ start I encountered is around 0830, latest at 0950/1000. Ending time is normally 1800-1900.</p>
              <p>NR would use the PM system, however, all its timing would need some math, as the timings usually have 2300-3000 kind of times.</p>
              <p>There is no special coding in the timesheet too to indicate overnight parking, just a line like 'Overnight Parking at BB Int' instead of 'Kranji Depot'.</p>
              <p>Have not researched into Premium service timings/shifts so let the folks who know that side explain lols... :D</p>

              <p>AM/PM comes first then think it's S1, S2 and then TQ.</p>
              <p>853 has 853TQ01 (effective only Sundays) served by TIB 1256E and so on... I remembered seeing an 853S202 with only 1 trip from Yishun to GL1 in the morning and the SL gets his swing break... =O</p>
              <p>So far I only know of 167 having an 167S151 which does Premium crossover, others not sure...</p>
              <p>851's crossover to 856 is AM/PM shift, and the code number (which I forgot) is within the 01-30 range. Think it's the 7th or 8th block. SMB 4A doing this block this week.</p>
              <p>Normally I find that reading SMRT timesheets are easier than SBST timesheets (or you could say so since I see SMRT timesheets more often than SBST ones)...</p>
              <p>So far I know of the Premiums holding parent service status are 587AM01 &amp; 588AM01.  </p>
              <p>And there's no limit as to whether a supplementary trip has to be Splits or not... we do see AM/PM duties doing crossovers, just that there's only a few, like the 190 crossover as mentioned just now and the 851 crossover.</p>
