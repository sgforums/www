              <p>I would do the exact opposite if i am u. Just pick all the good buses that may cost higher (but have a lower running cost) for example this hybrid. The gov't will eventually purchase all the buses from you during the tender exercise at cost less depre and you get the enjoy the fuel savings without forking out much for the vehicle costs.</p>

              <p>138Y was not sent back because of the lack of rear window, it was because SMRT did not want the bus as it was using Ventura doors since the rear doors were slow in closing, according to the STK staff which I talked to during the SMRT carnival. STK had already attempted selling the bus 2 times at a reduced price and 2nd time as a training bus, but SMRT rejected both offers. Currently there are no buyers for it, but since SMRT Enviros are using Ventura doors, STK may attempt to sell it to SMRT once more according to him.</p>

              8030L is Euro 4. regardless of whether is euro 4/5, the bus will still emit black smoke if its engine oil is not replaced regularly. only other propellants such as CNG and Hydrogen fuel cell bus wont emit black smoke. Hopefully some genius invent a reliable and economical and non-pollutant fuel for the engines to replace petrol/diesel driven vehicles soon.
