So if there are 20 regos that are R87, Should be TIB 281 to TIB 300.  Of course, I could be wrong, so anyone has concrete information, please share it here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">TIB390G (CSS294H) were never converted to NAC</div></blockquote>Ermmm, again, in 1996, that bus was converted to NAC when it was with TIBS. I checked with TIBS then.  Maybe they change it back to AC when transferred to SSB???<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">TIB400LÂ–TIB404B were never transferred to CSS. It was withdrawn in 1995 and sold</div></blockquote>From my email correspondance with a PR lady in TIBS way back to 1996 / 1997, she confirmed that TIBS had transferred 45 buses over to SSB.  TIB 380 to TIB 390 was 11, and TIB 391 to TIB 424 was 34.  Whether SSB used the buses or not, or they decided to sell it, that's another story.  But the original plan was all 45 buses were transferred.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">It was gutted out when all AC buses converted to NAC in 1994.</div></blockquote>Thanks for the info, and it should be converted in early 1995, not 1994.  1994 Nov, TIBS only have TIB 425 to TIB 441, serving on 851, not enough AC buses to go round.<br><br>And yeah, why don't we shift talk of the old regos ranges to the Nostalgia Thread, Sorry to threadstarter for going off Topic big time here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

If you have Bus Guide 1992, you can see the R87 on the cover, with black headlights cover.  The U31RCN from TIB318 to TIB336 has silver rectangle cover.<br><br>TIB 311 to TIB 317 were the next 7 buses that TIBS bought with AC, they are all Nissan Diesel U31SCN with Fuji Body and IBCU-050 AC.<br><br>TIB 318 to TIB 336 were Nissan Diesel U31SCN with Fuji Body, Non Air Con.<br><br>TIB 337 to TIB 361 were Hino HT238 with Hino Body, non Air Con.<br><br>TIB 380 to TIB 389 were Hino HT238K with Hino body and unknown AC.  Half of these buses were converted to non AC and then they were transferred to SSB.  These buses served on Service 950 if my memory is correct.<br><br>TIB 390 was a Nissan Diesel U31SCN with Fuji Body and Fuji IBCU-050 AC.<br><br>All the AC buses (TIB279, TIB280, TIB 311 to TIB317 and TIB 390) once served on Service 852.  I can't remember which service was the first to be PAC, so I will defer to SBST390's memory that Service 850 was the first.<br></div></blockquote>I am back here after a loooong absence.... okay I shall set the record straight here. Have been a Sembawangite the first 10 years of my life and an Yishunite thereafter and still is.<br><br>Yes, TIB279X and TIB280R are the first AC buses TIBS had. BUT (as some other thread stated)..... the first AC or PAC service was NOT 850, or 852.... rather, it was .... *drum-roll* 167!!!!!!<br><br>Yep, 167... then both AC buses (279X and 280R) went from 167 (rather quickly) to 850... and then (also rather quickly) to 852, where it stayed for a while before being given to the old service 950.<br><br>TIB311K to TIB317U were *NOT* AC buses from the outstart. They were in the same batch of NAC buses (WITHOUT the AC unit and ceiling blow ducts) that included TIB311K to TIB319P, which initially served on service 167 when first procured. TIB311K to TIB317U were only retrofitted with rooftop AC units sometime around when service 951 was introduced (due to shortage of AC buses). TIB320J to TIB336P were pressed into service shortly after TIB311K to TIB319P were bought.<br><br>WRT to R87 or U31SCN, frankly I dont know the diff between the two in terms of engine or chassis - all nissan sliding-door-exit buses (TIB251A to TIB336P, as well as the U31RCNs) all have the same engine cap (11670cc) and almost similar engine noises anyway. Any slight differences in engine noises are probably due to slightly different versions of automatic ZF gearboxes (all ZF's except likely Voith's in TIB335S and TIB336P).<br><br>And one very big potential discepancy - TIB311K to TIB317U, as well as TIB390G - likely never served on service 852 (at least as AC buses). Those buses had been at KJDEP as well as service 852 alright, but 852 had become a full NAC service (after TIB279X and TIB280R had been given to 950) by the time TIB390G were bought and TIB311K to TIB317U acquired their AC unit. And by the time 852 attained PAC and FAC status, TIB311K to TIB317U had either been retired from service or converted back to be used as NAC buses. TIB390G went on to SSB as well by then. Service 852 was one of the very last NAC service to be given PAC status (after TIB279X and TIB280R left).</div>
