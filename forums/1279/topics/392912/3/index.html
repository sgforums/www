              <p>I understand your point. But by saying that you wish the company you hate kena burned down because your favourite company kena the fire, shows people you are immatured. No offence. Just learn from these points. Its just pure bad luck that these happened. No one else wanted it either. Furthermore, its not as major as SMRT's infamous traffic accident, where people actually died from it. Corporate image may have impacted, but not as much as SMRT IMO.</p>

              <p>Faulty electrical components can be a source of fire too. Take a look at the Stomp's CNY goodie thread. Such a simple CNY lightup but it caught fire. Brand new somemore.</p>
