              <p>ya. how to adhere to the schedule esp during peak hours. common sense tell u that there are conditions on the road, like jams and accidents, not to mention overcrowding, when the BS have to tell everyone to move in and squeeze like sardines. when the bus is full and overcrowded, of cos dun expect the BS to drive at full speed limit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alot has to be given to the BS for taking initiative and judgement and empowerment to make decisions. I once saw 2 buses arriving  one after another, and then I have to wait a long time for the bus to arrive. schedule says one thing, but it is the humans who has the ability to make instant decisions and judgement and drive according to the road conditions.</p>

              <p><br>I somehow agree with you. There are times when the piece of paper put at the dash becomes useless and you have to run at your own time in order to keep up with the headway. I've experienced this before so I know. There are 2 perm drivers out of 14 on my home service 812 that die-die also must follow that piece of paper in front of them so even if the front bus run ahead of schedule they also depart on time, if not later, then the headway pulls to 13-14 mins from original 10 mins during off peak.</p>
              <p>Then when they realise they're late because their passenger loading increases, they drive recklessly and dangerously to try to keep up with the time written on that piece of paper in front again. -_-"</p>

              <p>No. 966 route is able to put bendies. It is because the demand isn't so high. Or you can say it fluctuates. The load can be very high during peak hours while during non peak hours it will have very little load. Junyang700 feedbacked to SMRT about the frequncy of 966 but they only added 1 more bus.</p>

              <p>To be frank, cheena &amp; indian BC/SL are usually the ones who have no law on the roads and schedule. They chiong like hell which they are the ones who usually make my schedule outing from late to early, just like Sv 27 that i boarded yesterday when a cheena BC drove a k230. Chiong like crazy from Sengkang to Hougang.</p>

              <p><br>That is the hour when WLDEP always faces a shortage of bendies where all the S-Shifts will start taking every bendy that is avalible from the depot especially for the case of the feeders, where shifts that uses rigid perms will have bendy cameos (911S101). That is why there are a lot of x-over slots that uses bendy because it is like killing 2 birds with one stone; like using 1 bus for 2 services (i.e. 900S151 slot where a bendy does 2 900A trips before 969)</p>

              <p>not asking the bus to drive 100km/hr. buses have speed limit, not asking them to drive to the maximum speed limit like 60km/hr.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>drive normally, not speed nor drive extremely slow as well. that is all we are asking for. the onus is on the driver to drive according to the road conditions. if approaching a bus stop, dun expect the driver to drive at speed of 60 km/hr lar. 20-30km/hr should be the speed approaching bus stop.</p>
