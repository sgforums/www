              60km/hr.</p>

              <p>drive normally, not speed nor drive extremely slow as well. that
              is all we are asking for. the onus is on the driver to drive
              according to the road conditions. if approaching a bus stop, dun
              expect the driver to drive at speed of 60 km/hr lar. 20-30km/hr
              should be the speed approaching bus stop.</p>

              <p>No. 966 route is able to put bendies. It is because the demand
              isn't so high. Or you can say it fluctuates. The load can be very
              high during peak hours while during non peak hours it will have
              very little load. Junyang700 feedbacked to SMRT about the frequncy
              of 966 but they only added 1 more bus.</p>

              and safe fashion.</p>
              <p>Upon crossing first arrow: Survey the junction, look for any
              abnormalties (accident, people etc). Green light, proceed on, amber
              light, brake smoothly to a stop.</p>
              <p>Upon crossing second arrow: Foot off the accelerator, standby on
              brakes. Observe lights; if turn amber then brake smoothly to a
              stop.</p>
              <p>Upon crossing third arrow: Step on accelerator. Jamming brakes
              at this point even at an amber light would cause passengers to fall
              down and the vehicle might get caught by the red light camera.</p>

              <p>One incident today as an example, took the 8210J on FFW 174e today back to Boon Lay as i all along know tht the BC driving this bus will always chiong &amp; i also need to go home early. BC already lambat like hell he still want to drag and drag and drag. I could have alighted at Orchard Rd and hopped on SBS9042X on Sv 174. When it arrived at BNL, both reached at the same time. Was utterly dissapointed with this BC as his back bus SBS8898A on FFW 174e already overtook him &amp; despite that he still continued to drag and drag and drag &amp; i angrily stomped to Sv 172 berth. Seriously, if i am a normal commuter i could have complained him to the route master.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not saying that we should not defend Bus Captains but as we know that an Express service, commuters paying Express fares we should at least get a level better ride than what of a normal trunk service. He go slowly due to he is early or heavy traffic on the roads i still can understand. But given that the BC is late and he drag even slower than a trunk service i've got nothing to say. So the moral of the story is this: Doesn't mean that an Express service would guareentee you a fast ride.</p>

              <p>Haha one thing that some folks may not be able to see is increasing frequency also increases air pollution. Frequency needs to be rationalized at times. Very good frequency but empty buses, or acceptable frequency and a bus that you can board?</p>
              <p>Empty buses (and very good frequency) on one side of the road may starve the other direction of sufficient buses. While you enjoy on one side, the other side may be suffering... It all goes down to Theory of Relativity.</p>

              <p>That's the purpose of Scania KUBs and MB OCs right? To be able to cope with the demands of passengers, yet being environmentally friendly. As for whether the buses are reliable enough to stay green for the next 5 years, that's another issue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
