              <p>....then why call it a scheduled bus service when there's no schedule to follow becuse no people means no people? think from the pax's view ba. they know the schedule roughly they wait for the bus. it might not seem that they take the bus everyday but they know the bus will arrive at schedule.</p>

              <p>If they are so confident about their schedule, then the timesheets should be public - let the public know at least the time the particular bus is due to arrive at the interchange/terminal. IRIS is one option, but there can also be no need to publish complicated timetables - just scribble on a whiteboard like in the TIBS era where the driver's name is hanged on for the trip.</p>

              <p>Try being in the shoes of BCs. You cannot expect to be bus racers, driving at 120 km/h. They have the big responsibility to take safety measures for the passengers and drive them to their destination. Sometimes, it's irritating when BCs drive so slow, but it's better than the BCs drive fast and kena accident and many injured.</p>
              <p>Take an earlier bus lor.. at least won't late or have slow buses.</p>
              <p>Slow buses are onli good for sleeping <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>since when the bus arrive on time or on cue/schedule anyway. I once waited for a bus to arrive (10 mins schedule) and it took 20 mins. I am sure you have your fair share of waiting longer than usual for the bus to arrive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there are variables on the road like traffic accidents, traffic jam, exigent circumstances on the bus, like people fighting, molesting, sick, or passengers fell down the steps and got injured and so forth. if there is an accident on the road, there is no way the bus is meeting the schedule. furthermore, there are manpower issues faced by the bus company, as not many sg tend to take up the job. what abt those drivers who are on mc and unable to work for the day, those who took urgent leave, annual leave and so forth. if the driver has a stomache and he has to drive out in 5 mins time from the interchange, there is no way he is going to do that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why the bus drive need to adhere to the schedule so punctuality. I feel that the driver should be given leeway to make his/her judgement and drive according to the road conditions, not as if telling BS to speed like F1 drivers, as some implied, hell no. Drive according to the road conditions, and at the speed limit given, no more, no less. driving at 10-30 km/hr seems like a nuisance to passengers and other road users, not asking the BS to overdrive at 70 km/hr. I believe the speed limit for bus is between 50-60 km/hr.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the time to arrive at the interchange is at 11.30pm, change it to the range of 11.30pm to 11.50pm, 20 or even 30 mins time for leeway and other circumstances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally to suggest deducting pay or bonuses for BS who do not meet the schedules, its very extreme and ridiculous as the pay for BS is already very low and the takeup for BS it already low by sg. if you are going to punish these and that, who the hell will go take up the job. for those who are doing their job well, pay them in the form of incremental increase yearlyand giving out higher bonuses to reward them.</p>

              <p>ya. how to adhere to the schedule esp during peak hours. common sense tell u that there are conditions on the road, like jams and accidents, not to mention overcrowding, when the BS have to tell everyone to move in and squeeze like sardines. when the bus is full and overcrowded, of cos dun expect the BS to drive at full speed limit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alot has to be given to the BS for taking initiative and judgement and empowerment to make decisions. I once saw 2 buses arriving  one after another, and then I have to wait a long time for the bus to arrive. schedule says one thing, but it is the humans who has the ability to make instant decisions and judgement and drive according to the road conditions.</p>
