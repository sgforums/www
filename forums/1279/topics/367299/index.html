              <p>Agreed. Took TIB1064S last Friday. When BC realised tat TIB482A was jus ahead of it (took a remarkable catch-up), BC tended 2 drive slow when going to BB Central.</p>

              <p>no the scenario I mentioned was snail pace. I board bus no 9 at simei, and its quite a short distance to bedok interchange.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the bus was driving incredibly slow lor, then purposely wait for the greenlight to turn red. when there are no passengers to board or alight, the driver drive to the bus stop and stop and then drive off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>slow is one thing, but 10-20 km/hr is really unacceptable. this pace is really like bicycle pace. if 40-50 km/hr is still ok.</p>

              <p>They are showing the wrong example. Pls dun do that if you intend to drive. The amber lights are there for a purpose, unless the lights turned amber at the point they cross the junction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p><br>hmm ya agree. some of the service i took often often drive super slow until i wanna slp. and because of this, they delayed the actual travelling tym as stated on sbst, following the journey planner</p>

              <p>ya ridiculous. one part of 56 schedule is 4 stops, 15minutes from tpy lor 2 to novena sq. mrt takes me 2minutes. insane lah. runtime 64minutes from bishan to suntec. mrt runtime is 20minutes. den 56 has awful headway at off peak.</p>
              <p>9888Y could stroll on 56 when it cameod at an average speed of about 20km/h lemme tell you. the distance of sv56 route is about 16km only.</p>

              <p>Anyway based on my experience, indian drivers always drive fast</p>
              <p>today i was taking bus to mrt, i was already late, lucky got this indian driver that drive fast, overtaking another bus in front to reach the bus stop 1st coz the bus in front was like driving at standard speed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> must follow company order like tat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I am aware that BC had a schedule to adhere to..........so this is a disclaimer to the following</p>
              <p>What that i am not sure is that when the DDU is green light and the too had been going on, some BC repeately choose to lambat like hell..dunnow what the hell they are doing, for example, stopping and calling at BS which is isolated(If the speed is 15 kph SBST and SMRT regulation i accept, but turning in is nonsense especially at BS where BC can clearly see bus stop paxs), also try to slow down like want the green light to turn yellow like that, no traffic at road yet spent 1 minute turning out(this can be excusable for Leyland drivers, haven eat rice no effort to steer, but for volvo drivers this puzzled me).</p>
              <p>I felt that OCCs need to mointer the speed of the drivers in particular. However, i felt SMRT droivers drive at a better speed than SBST, perharps schedule or perharps their own anticipation of BS crowd, traffic conditions, or perharps the better managment of speed by SMRT...</p>
