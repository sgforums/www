            <div class='col-md body'>sigh...~ from what i know...<br><br>hard to argue the point becuz...there is always a max. capacity for the bus. Therefore, the bus-driver is actually doing you a favour "when" he opens the front door, when the bus is full.<br><br>Else, he would just drive past, without stopping at the bus-stop. And whether you will be late for school or anything anot is your own responsibility, i.e. to get to the bus-stop early so that you can at least wait for 1 or 2 more buses.<br><br>No doubt the driver's attitude could have been better, but he is also very stressed i believe, cause he have to check people behind alighting the bus, and etc etc...asking people to shift in...blah blah...<br><br>Anyway, he should not have scolded you and ask you to get down the bus. Btw did you tap your card? if tapped, he has no right, if not-tapped, you get a free-ride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh let's not make a mountain out of a molehill. No need to write to the STForum. Let SBST investigate and they will revert to you. The BC will probably point out tt you were standing on the steps and blocking his blind spot. And he probably freaked out coz 2day's ST Home section, a cyclist died after he was grazed by a lorry! Spare a tot for him [i am not defending him but just being partial], he has to take care of all the passengers safety including urs and also the well-being of other road users and not forgetting return to the interchange in 1 pc and on time...

            <div class='col-md body'>The rear view mirror is an important tool for the driver. If you're tall, and from standing at the position, it is entirely possible for you to block the view of his mirror. He has to use the mirror to determine whether there are passengers alighting, and with the reflection of you taking up most of it, he is unable to do so.<br><br>In all seriousness, you could have explained to him its impossible to move in. Do you think he is able to see the passenger conditions? He has to keep his eyes peeled onto the roads. So his action of asking you to alight is justified as passenger safety is maintained.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my expert analysis of your situation, i can only figure out two possible reason why the driver scolded u for blocking his view..<br><br>1.<br>It could be that there was a beautiful and sexy lady standing behind you and you happened to blocking the driver's view of that lady, so the grouchy and flirty driver has to scold you<br><br>2.<br>It could be that you happened to have body odour while standing quite close to the driver's compartment and the driver can't stand your stinko smell and has to find a reason to get you to move further inwards the bus or else he will suffocate and faint and lose control of the bus and collide with the front vehicle</div>
