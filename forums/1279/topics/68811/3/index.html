Sorry for the Misunderstanding.   Also I took a bus today TIb 826 A CACMerc 0405 bus at 810am at bukit batok east ave 4. By the time it reached Bukit Batok east ave3. The bus was already fully packed and no one could board after that. The situation persisted till we reached Clementi fire station bus stop. I can imagine the people who cannot board who will be cursing.<br><br>Have a Nice day.<br><br></div></blockquote>Next time try not to use our jargons in feedbacks. I believe the staffs at SMRT would be wondering what is "CAC". Also, TIB 826 is not a CAC Merc, TIB 726 Y is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend (wdl_962), would like to clarify with all of<br>you that after some quering from the PTC through<br>online feedback, they stated that SBST and SMRT are<br>FREE to operate into each others' territories and that<br>THERE ARE NO SUCH RULES such as 2:1 towns like you all<br>mentioned. One of the feedback replies is as follows:<br><br>Dear Mr xxx,<br><br>We refer to your email dated xx xxxx 04 on the above<br>matter.<br><br>Please allow us to share with you that SMRT Buses<br>(formerly known as Tibs) was first allocated the<br>northern sector of Singapore in the early 80s. The<br>objective was to introduce healthy competition and<br>allow benchmarking of bus operators' efficiency, cost<br>effectiveness and service levels. When Sengkang and<br>Punggol were developed, Tibs was allocated the<br>responsibility to provide bus services to residents in<br>these two new towns.<br><br>However, with the award of the NEL to SBST Transit<br>(SBST), Sengkang and Punggol towns were reallocated<br>to SBST so that it could better integrate MRT, LRT and<br>bus services in the Northeast corridor for the benefit<br>of the residents there.In exchange, SBST had to<br>relinquish Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang towns in the<br>North-West sector. Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang towns<br>were selected on the basis that the exchange would be<br>equitable to both parties. Several factors were<br>considered in the town selection, for example<br>ridership figures and geographical proximity to Tibs'<br>area of bus operations.<br><br>Both SBST and SMRT Buses are assigned separate areas<br>of responsibility for bus operations. Each is<br>responsible to plan and put in operation their<br>respective bus network and services to meet the<br>mobility needs<br>of commuters in their own area of responsibility. But<br>this does not restrict the operators to operate bus<br>services into other operator's territory and to use<br>the terminal facilities there. There are also many<br>examples<br>of operators running their services from their own<br>areas to common corridors such as CBD and Jurong.<br><br>For your information, PTC in 2002 announced the<br>opening up of feeder bus services in HDB towns for<br>competition  to ensure that commuters enjoy an<br>affordable bus service that continues to improve over<br>time(please refer to our website at www.ptc.gov.sg).<br>PTC will strive to enhance the effectiveness of our<br>regulatory framework including introducing more<br>competition in the provision of bus services where<br>appropriate.<br><br>We hope the above address your concerns.  Thank you<br>for your feedback<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>XXX</div>
