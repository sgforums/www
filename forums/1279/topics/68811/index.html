Rationalisation is also necessary to ensure a high degree of integration of the bus and rail systems and to maximise the usage of the new rail line. This will help to lower the overall cost of public transport and hence, keep the fares affordable to the public.<br><br>In approving bus service changes under the NEL rationalisation exercise, PTC exercised great care to minimize any negative impact on commuters while ensuring that alternative services or convenient transfers to other bus services and stations along the NEL are available to those who may be affected. In addition, we asked SBS Transit to monitor the situation closely and fine-tune the bus services where necessary.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may be pleased to know that Integrated Public Transport information is already available in the Transitlink's website at www.transitlink.com.sg.You may make use of the website to plan your optimal journey by buses and trains around the island, for example, in term of minimum fare or shortest travel time. Alternatively, you may Contact Transitlink at 1800-7674333 for<br>travel enquires.</span><br><br>PTC is tasked to balance the interest of commuters with the long term financial viability of public transport operators. We are mindful of the impact of fare increases on commuters and will do our best to keep public transport fares affordable. For instance, bus and train fares are maintained at status quo this year in view of the poor economic situation.<br><br>Thank you for your feedback.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>XXX<br>Senior Officer<br>Public Transport Council<br></strong></div>

We are glad to note that you are pleased with our female staff at Geylang Lorong 1 Terminal and found her helpful. We would be tracing the said service staff and would convey your appreciation to her. We are also delighted to know that you are happy with the service, 966.<br><br>We wish to assure you that we have noted your suggestion to convert part of the route of Service 61 to ply via the expressways; changing the terminating point for Service 106 and to have services to Toa Payoh, Bishan, St Michael's, Punggol or Pasir Ris. We do not have any immediate plans to amend their routes or introduce new services at the moment.  However, we will give it due consideration where feasible in future.<br><br>We would like to explain that currently there is a link between Bukit Panjang and Tampines. Passengers can take Service 67 from Tampines to Upper Bukit Timah Road. From there, it is only a short distance walk to reach Bukit Panjang. Alternatively, they can alight at Ten Mile Junction and transfer to LRT to reach Bukit Panjang. It is not always possible to provide direct links to all places around the island. In the absence of a direct link, a transfer is necessary and the existing fare structure facilitates this by providing a transfer rebate to minimise the cost of making a transfer.<br><br>With the completion of the Circle Line, there may be network rationalisation. However, at this moment, it is still premature to comment on this.<br><br>It is indeed a pleasure ot know that you enjoy travelling on our bendy buses. We regret to inform you that we are not able to transfer two Mercedes Benz Volgren articulated buses to other interchanges as requested. We will consider it when we review our bus deployment plan in future.<br><br>Have a nice day.<br><br>Warmest Regards<br>[Name WIthheld]<br>DID   : XXXX XXXX<br>Fax   : XXXX XXXX<br>Email: xxx@smrtcorp.com.sg </span></div>

We are glad to note that you are pleased with our female staff at Geylang Lorong 1 Terminal and found her helpful. We would be tracing the said service staff and would convey your appreciation to her. We are also delighted to know that you are happy with the service, 966.<br><br>We wish to assure you that we have noted your suggestion to convert part of the route of Service 61 to ply via the expressways; changing the terminating point for Service 106 and to have services to Toa Payoh, Bishan, St Michael's, Punggol or Pasir Ris. We do not have any immediate plans to amend their routes or introduce new services at the moment.  However, we will give it due consideration where feasible in future.<br><br>We would like to explain that currently there is a link between Bukit Panjang and Tampines. Passengers can take Service 67 from Tampines to Upper Bukit Timah Road. From there, it is only a short distance walk to reach Bukit Panjang. Alternatively, they can alight at Ten Mile Junction and transfer to LRT to reach Bukit Panjang. It is not always possible to provide direct links to all places around the island. In the absence of a direct link, a transfer is necessary and the existing fare structure facilitates this by providing a transfer rebate to minimise the cost of making a transfer.<br><br>With the completion of the Circle Line, there may be network rationalisation. However, at this moment, it is still premature to comment on this.<br><br>It is indeed a pleasure ot know that you enjoy travelling on our bendy buses. We regret to inform you that we are not able to transfer two Mercedes Benz Volgren articulated buses to other interchanges as requested. We will consider it when we review our bus deployment plan in future.<br><br>Have a nice day.<br><br>Warmest Regards<br>[Name WIthheld]<br>DID   : XXXX XXXX<br>Fax   : XXXX XXXX<br>Email: xxx@smrtcorp.com.sg </span></div></blockquote>This is the fastest reply i for me cause i send on saturday they reply on monday,Wow nearly 2 days only1</div>

We all might know the person but there are those who have not heard of the name before. If something happens because one publish his/her name, the rest wouldn't want to be dragged into the matter.
