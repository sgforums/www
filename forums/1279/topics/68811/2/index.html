            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure if this topic is relevant here, I had feedback concerning the upgrading of MRT stattions from Redhill to Clementi, by replacing wall tiles with cemented walls. Anyway for your viewing pleasure.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>Thank you for your feedback. This reply is provided in consultation with SMRT.<br><br>Wall tile finishes was a common practice when the older stations, such as Redhill, Queenstown, Commonwealth, Buona Vista and Clementi Stations, were built. These stations have been operational for more than 15 years.<br><br>Some of the tiles at these stations had detached from the wall and fallen off. SMRT hence decided to remove the tiles, plaster and paint the exposed walls to ensure commutersÃ¢Â€Â™ safety and avoid the high cost of replacing the tiles. SMRT has advised that the refurbishment work had been completed and their Contractor had been tasked to rectify the identified defects. With the refurbishment work, the walls can be easily maintained through regular cleaning and repainting once every 5 to 7 years.<br><br>Having experienced such problems with wall tiles, we have decided to use cladding for the walls of Dover station instead, which requires regular cleaning only. According to SMRT, there is no significant cost difference between maintaining the wall finishes of Dover and Redhill Stations, except that Redhill Station would require repainting of walls every 5 to 7 years.<br><br>We would also like to highlight that the maintenance cost of wall finishes only constitutes about 5% of the total maintenance cost of each station. The bulk of maintenance cost is for the electrical and mechanical equipment such as fare equipment and escalators, which is also comparable between different stations.<br><br>My Suggestion<br>-------------------<br><br>SMRT had earlier put in a pretty obscene amount to retrofit those MRT stations, Redhill, Queenstown, Commonwealth, Buona VIsta, Clementi.<br><br>After causing more than 2 years of inconveiences to public, the upgrading were completed early this year.<br><br>What improvements have been make? Honestly after the retrofitting, the MRT stations looks awful, the workmanship wes terrible (I refer to BV station), who has buy off the job done?<br><br>It would be stupid to have the mosaic tiles back in those stations, let's hope we had learnt an expensive lesson from here.<br><br>If in the first place, the removal of mosaic tiles was for ease in maintenance, why Dover station was not designed with that in mind?<br><br>Can you tell me what is the mainteinance fees for Dover station as compared to Redhill station?<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all, this is with regards to the peak hour volume on sv963. I finally got quite fed up with the situation (yesterday was by far the worst when i had to wait for the 3rd bus cos the other 2 buses were so packed and the driver didnt stop at the bus stop at all) and send an email to LTA. The reply was very within a day.<br><br>Dear XXXXXX<br>I refer to your feedback on Service 963 to the Land Transport Authority<br>which was forwarded to us today.<br><br>We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused due to the waiting<br>time of Service 963.  We wish to take this opportunity to explain that after<br>1900 hours, Service 963 departs HarbourFront Interchange with an interval of<br>16 to 18 minutes.  Our latest checks showed that the capacity provided on<br>Service 963 is able to meet the demand. For your information, we have<br>recently added an additional bus to its operating fleet. To facilitate our<br>investigations, we would appreciate it if you could provide us with specific<br>information like the date and time of the incident if you encounter long<br>waiting time in future. This will help us to narrow down the trips to<br>ascertain the mentioned incident.

Sorry for the Misunderstanding.   Also I took a bus today TIb 826 A CACMerc 0405 bus at 810am at bukit batok east ave 4. By the time it reached Bukit Batok east ave3. The bus was already fully packed and no one could board after that. The situation persisted till we reached Clementi fire station bus stop. I can imagine the people who cannot board who will be cursing.<br><br>Have a Nice day.<br><br></div>
