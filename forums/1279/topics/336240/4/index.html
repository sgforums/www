              <p>Back in the days, part 3...<br> <br> Remember the days of the LAs, LO2x, VO2x &amp; MB O305...<br> Starting off with LAs, I only know it did 10, 35, 157, 222, 228,
              291, 293, 359 before it gets de-registered by the end of year
              2000..</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;">157 afaik only had it as cameos during 1999 from a photo seen... and from 1997 to 1998 there onwards, many of them disappeared from many services due to the major PAC/FAC conversion exercise i think; then did SBST 'shun bian' de-reg some of them from 98 to 99 there before dealing with the rest in 2001?</span></p>
              <p><br> For LO2x, ahh.. Only thing is more than 80 % of the LO2x buses were
              based in SLBP for the final 2 years serving Jurong East &amp; Boon
              Lay feeders and Jurong Industrial Services and the sole 157, <span style="color: #993366;">[add on 154 also; but from sources, those there went off 1st as compared to the 157 ones which went off with the rest; except a few that still managed to stay till dec there?]</span> while
              some were under BRBP 28 &amp; 90 and a few from AMDEP 107 and 410.. <span style="color: #993366;">[got 186 too =x]</span> True enough spotted some LO2x on 26 before together with other VO3x
              DDs when 26 uses DDs.. VSOs on 28 marks the lay up of some LO2x on
              28 and later on the LO2x in AMDEP began to lay up and
              de-registered.. while LO2x in SLBP contiunes to do revenue service
              before being decommissonised and de-registered at the end of
              2003..<br> <br> VO2x. However,
              once I spotted SBS7198T doing 157 before, as 157 was actually a PAC
              at that time.. <span style="color: #993366;">happened during 2004 there i think =/ sometimes during that year also got NAC scanias roaming around despite the default all-AC fleet with the withdrawal of LO2X? @@</span></p>
              <p>Lastly MB O305s, mostly common on 26, 31 and 410, others I've
              forgotten , so I only know their last usage of those MB O305s were
              153, 154, 165 &amp; 385 with only 30 units left.. the MBO305s that
              did hougang feeders, service 74, 153, 165, etc were eventually
              replaced by VO2xes and turned SP for a while before it gets
              de-registered.. By the end of 2001, only 7109-7112 remains on its
              fleet until it de-registered.. <span style="color: #993366;">may i know when did the de-reg start? got a feeling it's somewhat like the LAs whereby the extra units [some went to feeders at HG side] got displaced due to the conversion exercise esp from HG/AM trunk svcs turned spare 1st then slowly 'wait' for their lifespan to be up, and then de-reged. dunno who did mention that some units are now at batam/bintan... think is 247x/248x rego originally. any1 can confirm this?</span></p>

              <p><br>Yea... I rmb taking 97 to Selegie Road Peace Centre for tuition during my secondary school days. Back then its frequency is pretty good. Lots of buses were catered to the serive and there's no need to wait for more than 10mins most of the time.</p>
              <p>Now... it's re-routed and frequency sucks sometimes (can extend to 20-23 mins at times). Really miss the old svc 97. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>collinnxk88: Let me help you with some<br><br>As what I've read the complete fleet list from the Singapore Bus Services Part Two published by DTS (you can view it from LKCRL), the LAs were registered between 14 Dec 1984 to 10 Dec 1986, with the first few like SBS1637H to SBS1643P were registered on 14 Dec 1984, which the last, SBS5621B to SBS5624T, were registered on 10 Dec 1986.. I believe, assuming when those LAs had a 15 year lifespan, they de-registered 15 years after the date of registration, but some of the LAs registered in 1986 (SBS5613A to SBS5624T) were decommissioned and being withdrawn at the end of 2000.<br><br>I don't remember I've seen any NAC Scania N113s ever did 157 in 2004, despite VO2xes that cameo on 157 before.<br><br>MB O305 buses, in fact, were also never given a lifespan extension, they just de-register after 15 years as well. 14 Aug 1999 was the de-registration date of the MB O305s, with SBS2477X and SBS2478T being the first 2 buses to be de-registered, followed by SBS2481E and SBS2482C, de-registered on 9 Oct 1999.. By the end of 1999, SBS2477X, SBS2478T, SBS2481E to SBS2494X were de-registered..the period of de-registration took about 2 years (between end 1999 to early 2002) for all MB O305s to be dispersed from SBS fleet, SBS7110X, SBS7111T and SBS7112R were de-registered on 16 Jan 2002 (earlier on I did mentioned SBS7109B was the last few MB O305 left on the fleet at the end of 2001 but it was actually de-registered on 6 Aug 2001). But I'm not really sure of the rego of the MB O305s that are in Batam. With more MB O305s de-registered, the other buses began to be re-deployed on services that used the MB O305 buses as well as the LAs.</div>

              <p>guys, i did borrow the 2 books mentioned once from NP library...besides those 2 by DTS, no other local books alrdy? [almost wanted to point out a few errors in the book that time but nvm, i believe subsequent editions will rectify them]</p>
              <p>lemon, so when did the swopping end? if im not wrong, LAs came solely from BR only hor... btw, there was a day in 1998, quite a few O305s cameoed on 157; could recognize at that time from the body length alrdy. but too bad no pics to support.</p>
              <p>scania, thanks for your clarification =x</p>

              <p>I missed the good ole farecard days. back then, passengers board and alight the bus so quickly. Nowadays, boarding fast is quick but alighting bus is very slow as lots of passengers take their own sweet time to tap their ez link card before getting out.</p>

              <p>collinnxk88: Let me help you with some<br> <br> As what I've read the complete fleet list from the Singapore Bus
              Services Part Two published by DTS (you can view it from LKCRL),
              the LAs were registered between 14 Dec 1984 to 10 Dec 1986, with
              the first few like SBS1637H to SBS1643P were registered on 14 Dec
              1984, which the last, SBS5621B to SBS5624T, were registered on 10
              Dec 1986.. I believe, assuming when those LAs had a 15 year
              lifespan, they de-registered 15 years after the date of
              registration, but some of the LAs registered in 1986 (SBS5613A to
              SBS5624T) were decommissioned and being withdrawn at the end of
              2000.<br> <br> I don't remember I've seen any NAC Scania N113s ever did 157 in
              2004, despite VO2xes that cameo on 157 before.<br> <br> MB O305 buses, in fact, were also never given a lifespan extension,
              they just de-register after 15 years as well. 14 Aug 1999 was the
              de-registration date of the MB O305s, with SBS2477X and SBS2478T
              being the first 2 buses to be de-registered, followed by SBS2481E
              and SBS2482C, de-registered on 9 Oct 1999.. By the end of 1999,
              SBS2477X, SBS2478T, SBS2481E to SBS2494X were de-registered..the
              period of de-registration took about 2 years (between end 1999 to
              early 2002) for all MB O305s to be dispersed from SBS fleet,
              SBS7110X, SBS7111T and SBS7112R were de-registered on 16 Jan 2002
              (earlier on I did mentioned SBS7109B was the last few MB O305 left
              on the fleet at the end of 2001 but it was actually de-registered
              on 6 Aug 2001). But I'm not really sure of the rego of the MB O305s
              that are in Batam. With more MB O305s de-registered, the other
              buses began to be re-deployed on services that used the MB O305
              buses as well as the LAs. *again, from dunno which part of this forum, got sources saying that there was massive cameoing of LAs/O305 all around most notably in AM/BR DD services around 2000, which tended to irritate the hell out of some commuters at that time @.@*</p>

              <p>oh ya, if im not wrong, before 1997, the lifespan was 12 years right? somehow the 12 &gt; 15 years ruling affected the LAs and O305s the most...

                      Bt Batok feeders used to have MB O405 CACs , some DAFs used to deploy on CCK feeders and most of Hino volgren serve on 188.. later in 2001-02, there was a switch between DAF and MB O405 CACs, some DAF and Hino Volgren goes to serve Bt Batok feeders , and the MB O405 CACs goes to serve CCK feeders.. Service 188, on other hand, gets to receive the MB O405 OACs as a replacement.

              </blockquote>
              <p>B57 by ZYX<br>Well the first unit was of cuz the demonstrator. built in Soon Chow bodywork the bus came in may 1979 to show off with SBS. Bus was registred as a SBS6790P and placed with the 6xxx bus depot... = TPDEP. Bus was trial on svc 148.<span style="color: #993366;"> it is unknown what happens to this bus after the trial.<br></span></p>
              <p>So i guess SBS liked the B57s and ordered some (i think) 200 or so unis built with new Zelanad bus builders NZMB and tranny was Allison auto tranz. The first NZMB unit came as SBS3433R and was deployed on svc as 140. By 1981, both ranges 34xx and 47xx began to come in.<span style="color: #993366;"> i have no ideas of the original deployments of each and every B57. </span></p>
              <p>But juding by the rego ranges ,, the 3xxx ones shd be new with west side depot like Woodlands depot (assuming it still existed) but weird was 3433 was new to TPDEP...and <span style="color: #993366;">the 47xx ones were definitely new to BNDEP. (recall BEDEp only ake 2xxx buses) i have faint recallation of the first few 47xx ones on svc 14. (Orchard svc lol)</span><br><br>as the years passed some 34xx B57s were trasnferred to the East and BBDEP. The B57s even strayed into JRDEp doing svcs like 20 and 192. The 47xx ones were more stable and mianly stayed in the east Bedok area until in the late 90s some stay over to BBDEP. i recall many of them doing svc 202 and then svc92, 95 and svc75.<br><br>In the late 90s, came the things called JB B57s. <span style="color: #993366;">Not very sure of the ranges then but i think 3500 to 3533 were 170s</span>. these guys never left 170. after 170 took on the nice Mark 2s the buses languished ard BBDEp feeders and trunks like 176 etc.</p>
              <p>By the end of the late 90s , many of the B57 were screeching with their fan belts. this i remember fondly and today rides on Mark IVs when fan belts screech remind me of the B57s.</p>
              <p>Some interesting facts<br>1) in the later years of their life, a few B57s were chosen to be remodelled with air-con unit at the driver area to cool the BC down.. cooool</p>
              <p>2) Mark 2 style seats was fitted on some B57 in a refubsihment excercise in the mid 90s. <br><br>3) in the early days the rear desto holder indeed held rear destos. However it was shhort lived and the SBS logo were slotted in intead of rear destos.</p>
              <p>4) the B557 came in raised roof and flat roof versions. most 34 and 35xx were raised roof and the rest 47xx were flat roof. <span style="color: #993366;">Rasied roof means the desto hhoding area at front was raised. perhaps for a bigger desto box</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>the last round of B57s at BNDEP (the 49xx)  ended up in Bedok, Tampines &amp; Pasir Ris feeders until the end of 1995..the day when the B57s were dispersed off from the fleet at BNDEP.. A few other 49xx buses based at HGDEP were also served on Hougang feeders as well as Service 382 and 385 before progressively withdrawn from the fleet at the end of 1995 (or early 1996?)..</div>
