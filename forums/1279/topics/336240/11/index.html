              <p>Yes, that's the font. One look at it and I already knew that
              isn't either Arial or Helvetica; if it's not an SBS in-house font,
              then it's probably one of the Grotesque sans-serif font (you might
              want to read that up on WIkipedia).</p>
              <p>I might do a post-article about desto fonts one of these
              days.</p>

              I think SBS was the one that produce the desto font, in the 1980s.

              the desto red/green background was used as a shortworking trips. Back then, they used this kind of desto with termination points, rather than using SWT numbers like 67A, 67B, etc.

              <p>The first to use the current format and one-panel technology, yes.</p>
              <p>The Hispano-bodied DAFs had seperated matrix panels of flip-dots for destination details and the route number; it was either something like:</p>
              <p>[][][][][][][][][][][][][][] []*[]*[]* <br> [][][][][][][][][][][][][][]</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>[]*[]*[]* [][][][][][][][][][][][][][]<br>            [][][][][][][][][][][][][][]</p>
              <p>[]* - double size panel</p>
              <p>[] - normal size panel</p>
              <p>The flip-dot display were non-refreshing (much like the ones used on the Malaysian Dennis Lances), and showed only two places - the destination, and a via point (very much like what the Scania K230UBs displayed when they first came out). The route number's position is also fixed to whichever side the double-size panels, which are used to display the route number, were located. As there were only three panels, the displays were incapable of displaying any route number that requires more than three characters, as well as limited route details. For example, it could possibly display something like 67W or 852, but not something like 859A.</p>
              <p>I guess this was why then-TIBS sold many of them off and redeployed them to CSS in the late 1990s; then, buses had a 12- (or was it already extended to 15 then?) year lifespan; these buses were bought in 1990, which meant they only had a few years left then before expiring. Probably seeing how inflexible their displays were, and how it made more economic sense to just sell them off (since their replacements had came in by then) rather than retrofit them with the newer flip-dot displays, I guess TIBS decided to just sell them off. The transfers to CSS were probably because their CSS division needed some fleet expansion then, and the limited needs of CSS means that the Hispano-bodied DAF buses, with their limited flip-dot displays, could suffice.</p>
              <p>If the Hispano-bodied DAFs were not prematurely sold off, they might still be on our roads today, though in their last throes though - assuming a 17-year lifespan with the extra two-year extension taken up, these buses could be on our roads until 2009, which is this year!</p>

              <p>Oh you are prolly referring to the Hino OAC's. They are not
                  CAC's although their windows can be opened. They were bought new
                  new around 1988 or 1989 uniquely and specially to create the old
                  Service 950 from Woodlands to Shenton way. Later when the DAF,
                  Nissan and Merc OAC's came these Hino's went out from 950/951 to
                  other places. Rego's TIB380K to TIB389L. 10 units. I don't know
                  which ones ever permed on 169 but even if they did, it would be for
                  a short time.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As far as I know, those Hinos were not CAC but the Nissans were. This includes the Nissan U31RCN that are currently running on our roads.</p>
              <p>Up until the mid or late 1990's at least, Japanese bus manufacturers often liked to fit such openable windows onto both air-conditioned and non air-conditioned buses. I have no idea why, but assuming the climate in Japan, I could guess they ran as air-conditioned buses in the summer and winter months (the latter using heaters, of course), and as non air-conditioned buses in spring and autumn.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, I believe it's for economic reasons; by standardising as many parts between both the non air-conditioned and air-conditioned versions as possible, spares for both buses can be ordered in greater bulk, and hence more cheaply. Let's just imagine this scenario: if the air-conditioned versions came with glass screen windows, then specialised glass screen window spares had to be ordered for these buses; if their windows were ever broken, only these glass screen window spares can be used;  having to specially order them in small quanities to maintain the relatively small fleet of these buses could had been relatively expensive. But since the air-conditioned versions used the same windows as the non air-conditioned ones, it doesn't matter if the non air-conditioned version's window is installed since they are practically using the same windows.</p>
              <p>Of course, this is no longer an issue today since most buses running today are bought in only air-conditioned versions.</p>

              <p><br>If I am not mistaken, the CAC Hinos did mainly on services 169, 178 and 181. Due to the fact that Tibs only made the plastic blue destos for some bus services only. Service 178 had some perms if I am not wrong, whereas service 169 and 181 were mainly cameos.</p>
              <p>For the CAC Nissan U31 SCNs (TIB311K - TIB317U, TIB390G which uses the roller destos), the above mentioned services as well as services 160, 852 and 925 also had deployments before. Remembered TIB311K and TIB315A perm service 160, TIB317U perm service 925 way back in 1996 until they were converted back to NAC.</p>
