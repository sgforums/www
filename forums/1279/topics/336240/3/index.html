              <p><br>Problem with farecards is that if you bend it, since it is so filmsy, the card is meaningless to you. For your second point of alighting, I do strongly agree. I see people they have the EZ Link card in their bag and they use the bag to tap. They have to find it's location and waste time. Back then, you have to press the fare amount then collect the card with the farecard and ticket, people like to underpay when they are travelling long trips......</p>

              <p><br>Can anyone confirms whether service 185 had DDs when plying loop from Choa Chu Kang to Jln Anak Bukit?</p>
              <p>Service 300 had DDs when under SBS. For a period of time (think 1997 - 1998), the service was split into 300G (green plate) and 300W (white plate) as the route was amended to ply bi-directional. This version of the route is shown in the 1998 Transitlink Guide.</p>
              <p>Service 307 under SBS was a townlink service integrated from service 301 (loop at Teck Whye Lane) and service 303 (loop at St 62).</p>
              <p>Service 927 was originally planned to be introduced as SBS service 137 in 1995, however Tibs was choosen to start the service with no change in route and Tibs re-numbered the service to 927 before it was started. The original route was from the zoo to loop along Mandai Rd, this version of the route is shown in the 1996 Transitlink Guide. Then in 1996, it was extended to Choa Chu Kang via BKE and Bt Panjang Rd. Amended again in 1999 to ply the current route with the amendment of service 171 as a result of Bt Panjang LRT bus rationalisation.</p>
              <p>Service 75 was orginally Choa Chu Kang - Marina Centre before it was shortened to Bt Panjang with the introduction of service 179.</p>
              <p>Service 185 was not extended to Lor 1 Geylang. As the Tibs press release put it, service 185 and service 989 were integrated to become service 985.</p>
              <p>Service 172 was originally Lim Chu Kang - Shenton Way (may has an earlier version), shortened to loop from Lim Chu Kang to Jln Anak Bt, then amened to terminate at Boon Lay instead of Lim Chu Kang with the introduction of service 175. On the day of handover to Tibs, Tibs changed the route from Boon Lay - Jln Anak Bt (loop) to Boon Lay - Choa Chu Kang (ie. route was Boon Lay - Jln Anak Bt (loop) up to the last day under SBS, route was Boon Lay - Choa Chu Kang from the first day under Tibs.)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back in the days, part 3...<br><br>Remember the days of the LAs, LO2x, VO2x &amp; MB O305...<br>Starting off with LAs, I only know it did 10, 35, 157, 222, 228, 291, 293, 359 before it gets de-registered by the end of year 2000.. Once SBS deploys about 4 LAs on 269 (that the worst part I've ever seen so far, although it does not meet the passenger load on 269) and when the LAs de-registered, it was converted back to Single Deck service.. long time when CCK service was under SBS, LAs were deployed on 185,190 &amp; CCK feeders..<br><br>For LO2x, ahh.. Only thing is more than 80 % of the LO2x buses were based in SLBP for the final 2 years serving Jurong East &amp; Boon Lay feeders and Jurong Industrial Services and the sole 157, while some were under BRBP 28 &amp; 90 and a few from AMDEP 107 and 410.. True enough spotted some LO2x on 26 before together with other VO3x DDs when 26 uses DDs.. VSOs on 28 marks the lay up of some LO2x on 28 and later on the LO2x in AMDEP began to lay up and de-registered.. while LO2x in SLBP contiunes to do revenue service before being decommissonised and de-registered at the end of 2003..<br><br>VO2x, at start, many were deployed on BBDEP and do 190, but later when 190 is FAC, they were given to Bt Batok feeders like 361, 367 (365 i dun think so have DDs before) and Choa CHu Kang feeders like 300,302 &amp; 307.. prior to the take over of CCK service, they were being scattered around on other BBDEP services like 74, 93, 165, 285, etc.. There are other VO2x based in HGDEP, AMDEP &amp; BNDEP.. VO2x in HGDEP serves Hougang Feeders like 321, 322, 326, 327 &amp; 328 and Service 154, while AMDEP had VO2x on 70 and 107 (u must have remembered 7198-7200 was a 107 perm) , and the BNDEP , had VO2x on 31, 35, 222, 291 &amp; 359.. Until 2003, when the LO2x in SLBP starts to be de-registered, the majority of the VO2x (some stayed in BBDEP 74 &amp; ARBP 93) were going to SLBP to do Jurong Industrial services as well as others like 154, 192 &amp; 193.. SBS7228R was the last VO2x to leave HGDEP 322 for SLBP.. However, once I spotted SBS7198T doing 157 before, as 157 was actually a PAC at that time..<br><br>Lastly MB O305s, mostly common on 26, 31 and 410, others I've forgotten , so I only know their last usage of those MB O305s were 153, 154, 165 &amp; 385 with only 30 units left.. the MBO305s that did hougang feeders, service 74, 153, 165, etc were eventually replaced by VO2xes and turned SP for a while before it gets de-registered.. By the end of 2001, only 7109-7112 remains on its fleet until it de-registered..<br><br>OTHERS: LO2x, SBS6907X and SBS7196Z are still around, they are NYC Office Bus &amp; Boobie the Gymbus (now at Jubillee Rd) respectively.. before that SBS6907X was SLBP 254 and SBS7196Z was SLBP 192..<br>VO2x, SBS7204J and SBS7251Y were sold to UK, previously 7204 was BBDEP and 7251 was under BNDEP (saw this on 31 &amp; 35 before).. Other uses like SBS7297R is used as MILK Bus<br>MB O305, SBS2569P was used as a Magic Ark Bus by RGS, when SBS1793P (the MK2) was converted to Magic Bus in 2000, as a replacement of SBS2569P, the bus was de-registered and scrapped. SBS1793P was re-registered as YK5257P, and later in 2001, it was also scrapped when the bus no longer serve as a purpose anymore</div>
