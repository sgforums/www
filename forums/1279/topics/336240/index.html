                                      changed and progressed rapidly since its early days, from bus

                                      farecard validators to the current EZ-Link cards. Bus technologies
                                      also changed rapidly to the current modern and comfortable public

              <p>I shall share my pleasant memories.</p>
              <p>In 2000, I used to take Service 9 to my kindergarden almost everyday. That time Service 9 was under HGDEP control so there were lots of Mark IV DMs which I could remember.</p>
              <p>Somewhere around that year, I remember taking OAC O405 on 31 a few times with blue unrefurb seats. Soon after that I discovered that all O405s already had pink refurbished seats. Also, I remember taking an LO2x on 28 to Tampines for just once and no more. Was such a nice ride on the lower deck. I still remember the days when Service 220 was around and took it a number of times mostly CAC Scanias and a few times NAC Scania. There were also VO2x on 35 those days which I took too.</p>
              <p>In 2001, I remember my first ride on a DM3500 which made me instantly fall in love with this model.</p>
              <p>Between 2001 and 2003 I started to fall in love with the O405s when I started taking them frequently on Services 13, 24 and 31. Nevertheless, during those days I also took a number of VOs and LOs which I enjoyed too. I really missed the days when Service 2 had lots of VOs and now replaced by horribly vibrating B9TLs and thankfully I don't take this service very often now. I especially miss the O405s on Service 24.</p>
              <p>I can also remember those beautiful yellow top bus stops before they were replaced with boring grey bus stops. Thankfully we still have some unique orange top bus stops now. It would be nice to have some old things around us rather then keep replacing them.</p>
              <p>Everything was so nice especially during the late 1990s and the very early 2000s with SBS and TIBS. Those were the days with much more unique and nice buses (not to forget better service standards).  must say that the merging of TIBS and SMRT was a BIG BIG mistake. If they did not merge, we would still be enjoying the good services by TIBS and there would be lesser complaints in general. Things would be nicer if SMRT operates the NEL, SBS remains SBS and TIBS remains TIBS.</p>

              <p>1:I still can remember the times when "Jackie Chan"(His face look like Jackie Chan) drove 293 the past 10 years, since i am born, and the driver looked to me in a smile in the past and the current. From N113s to Mark IIIs, and from Mark IIIs to the K230s, He always bring me good rides everytime i board his bus. There was a time when i was walking home then i see him driving KUB then he stared at me.I thought that he liked me (I am not a gay hor).</p>
              <p>2:"The times when svc 28 had a lot of B10TLs", this title may look things in you but different to me.Last time during the 2003s, i still remember that from SBS9801Y to SBS9807G, these buses served 28 when it first came to singapore, and went direct to the first deployments, Service 28. I love taking the B10s and then they seprated.</p>
              <p>9801 to BNDEP 81<br>9803 became a SP(if i am not wrong)<br>9804 went to AMDEP 76<br>9805 went to BNDEP 12<br>9807 went to AMDEP 22</p>
              <p>These became a shock to me until that some buses came in, SBS9824G and SBS9829T. There were only 3 B10TLs until the few weeks before, SBS9831K, SBS9834C, came in to service 28.Until then i can have B10TL rides more often.</p>
