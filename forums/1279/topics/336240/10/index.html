              <p>And when the Malaysian-made Dennis Lance buses came in, they
              also replaced the Scania L113CRL buses on route 59 (very faintly
              recall the latter buses on that route); I still remember taking a
              Dennis Lance on route 59 from Ang Mo Kio to Jalan Kayu with my
              family to go to the <em>roti prata</em> stalls there.</p>
              <p>I am not sure now, but I do recall that they (the Dennis Lance

              <p>Currently, yes. Only the Malaysian Dennis Lance buses have these
              "furry" panelling, at least in regards to public buses.</p>
              <p>I do remember that several other air-conditioned buses used to
              have them, such as SBS Transit's (then SBS') Mercedes MB O405 buses
              before refurbishment. I also remembered that the Duple-Mestec
              bodied version had two versions of it's interior: both had the
              "furry" panelling if I remember correctly, but one had
              non-adjustable air-conditioning slit vents (if you want to know
              what they looked like, think of the vents in today's SMRT's
              Mercedes OC500LE or Habit-bodied MB O405G, minus the rotary lever
              and jutting out, and positioned closer to the celling), while the
              other had round adjustable ones similar to the ones all of them
              have today. Were the differences based on the model of the
              air-conditioning unit they had?</p>

              <p>Should be in the late 1990's or early 2000's.</p>
              <p>Still remember that in the 1990's, non air-conditioned buses have destos with their destinations (or destination and looping point, for loop routes) on their front destos, while air-conditioned ones used destos that had the words "AIR CON" on the right (left from our perspective). The large double-deck bus front destos (for the Olympians) also had "via" route information on them; this applied for both the air-conditioned ones (which similarly had the words "AIR CON" on them) and the non air-conditioned ones. Side destos, regardless of size, had a blue bar on red for air-conditioned routes; can't remember the colour for the non air-conditioned ones (was it green bar on white?).</p>
              <p>Starting around 2000 or 2001, SBS Transit decided to simplify the desto system, and now most destos are simply white and red (except for a few categories of bus routes, such as the Express and Premium routes); most front destos now lack destination information or the words "AIR CON". Sometimes, however, legacy destos (that have either the destinations or, rarer still, the words "AIR CON" get used) do get used; route 170, as well as the newer route 160, continue to use this legacy system probably due to regulations in Malaysia. Some double-deck destos also preserve this system, but mostly without the "via" system. Destos also now come in different fonts, rather than the unified font system used in the past; personally, personally I prefer the more consistent system of using the same font for destos in the past, unlike the clashing variety of fonts we have today (Helvetica, FF Meta, Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman, and ITC Avant Garde, in addition to the original sans-serif font that was consistently used in the past), which does not really present a as-clean image as it could if only one font was used.</p>

              <p>I remembered taking a CAC Hino (squarish bodywork) on service 169, complete with blue front and side desto. The interior had blue coloured cushion seats. The poles near the driver's cabin is black in colour. If I'm not wrong there's one or two such buses and the last time I saw the bus was when the O405s were newly introduced. It disappeared after that.</p>

              <p>Oh you are prolly referring to the Hino OAC's. They are not CAC's although their windows can be opened. They were bought new new around 1988 or 1989 uniquely and specially to create the old Service 950 from Woodlands to Shenton way. Later when the DAF, Nissan and Merc OAC's came these Hino's went out from 950/951 to other places. Rego's TIB380K to TIB389L. 10 units. I don't know which ones ever permed on 169 but even if they did, it would be for a short time.</p>

              <p>Yes, that's the font. One look at it and I already knew that isn't either Arial or Helvetica; if it's not an SBS in-house font, then it's probably one of the Grotesque sans-serif font (you might want to read that up on WIkipedia).</p>
              <p>I might do a post-article about desto fonts one of these days.</p>

              <p>honestly, theres nothing wrong with the huge variety of fonts

              <p>Yes, legibility is the most important aspect of the destos; still, as a minimalist and a consistency-ist, I feel SBS Transit could had done better in this department by simply sticking to no more than two or three fonts rather than using so many of them.</p>
