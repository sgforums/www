              <p>the 6944 seem to orginate form svc196 which had lo2x as well. 7133 as well.  However 198 got a big batch of 7131 to 7138 new new. just that i did notice some lo2x n merc of 196 ended up on 157 in those days.</p>

                  I dun think those B57s were deployed on any trunk svcs just before its withdrawal in 1995 (appear rarely though).. take an example of service 61, 82 or 84, they used those 'modern' buses like O405s, MK2s, MK3s, etc.., while the feeders like 321, 322, etc get the B57s before they were being withdrawn, though there are some NAC mk2 cameos.

              <p>chiko, the olympus ad mentioned was the noticeable full-body ad on LO2X for svc 97 [then later perm on 333 after the exercise]</p>
              <p>as for 143, the most famous one would be the Bee Cheng Hiang ad... From LO2X to LO3X to the current B9TL @.@ [somemore one of a kind in sg; no other svc has that brand's ads.]</p>
              <p>think before the rationalisation exercise too, there's 3557 on 157 also. btw, the LO2X fleet still remained about the same with few changes even when loads of LO3X came in during 95/96? [some LO3X esp from JR side, quite a few taken out during the exercise in '98 to fill up 98, then in 99, 179 took a few LO3X fleet from there i think? =/] no wonder from '99 to early '03 there, the chance of taking an LO2X on 157 seems to be higher than that of the 3-axle cousin? also i noticed a few years back from '01 onwards, more MB O405s seemed to infiltrate 157 as replacements for LO2X... in which those on BR side slowly start to disappear from the fleet register while those in SL side still continue serving? =/</p>
              <p>As for 334, there's 3551 to 3554, 3557 to 3559 /60 [3554 and 3560 transferred out i think].</p>
              <p>got 1 time in 1996 i recall, there was white vomit on 3554, but almost 1 week still not cleared -.- on the floor of the lower deck.</p>

              <p>chiko, the olympus ad mentioned was the noticeable full-body ad on LO2X for svc 97 [then later perm on 333 after the exercise]</p>
              <p>as for 143, the most famous one would be the Bee Cheng Hiang ad... From LO2X to LO3X to the current B9TL @.@ [somemore one of a kind in sg; no other svc has that brand's ads.]</p>
              <p>think before the rationalisation exercise too, there's 3557 on 157 also. btw, the LO2X fleet still remained about the same with few changes even when loads of LO3X came in during 95/96? [some LO3X esp from JR side, quite a few taken out during the exercise in '98 to fill up 98, then in 99, 179 took a few LO3X fleet from there i think? =/] no wonder from '99 to early '03 there, the chance of taking an LO2X on 157 seems to be higher than that of the 3-axle cousin? also i noticed a few years back from '01 onwards, more MB O405s seemed to infiltrate 157 as replacements for LO2X... in which those on BR side slowly start to disappear from the fleet register while those in SL side still continue serving? =/</p>
              <p>As for 334, there's 3551 to 3554, 3557 to 3559 /60 [3554 and 3560 transferred out i think].</p>
              <p>got 1 time in 1996 i recall, there was white vomit on 3554, but almost 1 week still not cleared -.- on the floor of the lower deck.</p>

              <p>7163 did 143 until 1998 when 143 turns FAC, after than it gets re-deployed to 97 until 97 turns FAC somewhere in 2000 I think. The bus was with a later version of Olympus ad when it did 97.<br><br>After it get re-deployed out of 97, I still remembered that on one point of time it serves 331 until the Teban Garden rationalisation in 2002 in which 331 ceased to exist.<br><br>As for 334, if I am not wrong 6943, 6968 and 3553 were initially 334 before being re-deployed on 51, 198 and 242 respectively.<br><br>As for those JRBP LO3x in 157, 9125, 9082, 9115, 9104, 9155 and later 9128 came to 157 when 157 starts using Lo3X in 1996 and subsequently 9125, 9082, 9115 and 9104 (as well as 9110, 9123 &amp; 9126 from 154) gets re-deployed to 98 when 98 turns FAC in 1998 and in returns 157 gets some ex 98 LO2x like 6990, 7161 and 7191 etc as replacement.<br><br>Then in 2001, 9128 and 9155 were also transferred to 179 (although a short while later 9155 gets re-deployed to 97) and 157 got another 2 LO2x (7167 and 7192) in return. So during the period between 2001 and 2003 there aren't any JRBP LO3x on 157 until early 2003 when 9039, 9072 and 9077 gets re-deployed on 157.<br><br>Speaking back to LO2x, who still remembers some of the BRBP LO2x gets redeployed to SLBP during early 2003 when it was near its end of lifespan? 6911 was one of them though when it serves 255 then.</p>
              <p><br>And BTW during the LO2x days, 6966 was holding the BEe Cheng Hiang full body ad even until the bus gets re-deployed on 157.</p>

              <p>hmm, 97 also went FAC same time as 143, 197, 51, 98 and all those.</p>
              <p>as for the rumour that O305s cameoed on 157 on certain occassions in '98/99, [the LA case, got picture] did it happen?</p>
              <p>in short, LO2X deployment on trunks like 157/154 slowly started to be reduced from end '02 to 03 onwards till withdrawal?</p>
              <p>oh and btw, alot of the 2Xs from feeder svcs became spares following introduction of MB O405/CAC mk2 into feeders? [1st in 1999, then 2000/2001 there more of them gradually till end of 3rd quarter 2003 then totally FAC i suppose?] recalled that SLBP did have space for some MK2s too despite the 'flood' of roughly 120 to 150+ LO2X from 2001 to early 2003 there, where some went for early retirement @.@</p>

              In the CSS Guide of 1981, there is a pix of the CSS178K pix (which is a Hino BF177).. CSS178K to CSS194M were used. When CSS bought newer Nissan Diesel U31RCN they re-use the rego in this range and add in CSS195K to CSS207K, while the CSS Hino BF177 were transferred to TIBS to do 161 for a short peiod of time and re-registered as TIB362M to TIB379R. And again TIBS phased out the Hino BF177 and replaced with newer Nissan buses with the same registration plates minus off TIB378T and TIB379R.
