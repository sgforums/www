              <p>Hmmm... still remember that my first ride on an air-conditioned public bus was a Mercedes MB O405 on one of the Yishun trunk routes in 1994 or 1995.</p>

                          TIB279X and TIB280R, are all along KJDEP based. They never go to AMDEP to do the old 857.<br><br>The old 857 (Yishun to Admiralty Rd West) was introduced in 1993, with the CAC Nissan Diesel U31SCN (the TIB311K to TIB317U) that were ever being deployed on that service. Later, some of the OAC Nissan Diesel U31RCN buses joined in 857 for the short period of time, after when the existing OAC Nissans were replaced by O405s on 851 &amp; 854. There was ever a O405 cameo on 857 before (i.e. TIB425R &amp; TIB426M). It was withdrawn when 857 merged with 169.<br><br>When Bt Panjang services were taken over by TIBS, prior to it, the new MB O405 buses were showcased on 4 sundays in different locations throughout the whole period of June 1995, whereby those newer buses will be deployed on 177, 179 &amp; 184 (the 1st phase of BP takeover) and progressively went on to other Bt Panjang Services together with NAC Hino &amp; Nissan buses. Leaflets about the new TIBS buses were also enclosed with the Sembawang Town Council newsletter in May 1995 if I'm not wrong.

              <p>CAC Nissans? Now that's a surprise to me; for as long as I can remember, I had never seen any of those CAC-style Japanese buses in Yishun (i.e. the air-conditioned Hinos and the CAC Nissan U31SCNs) until around 1995 or 1996, when routes 950 to 952, the majority user of these buses, were withdrawn and their buses given to other routes; route 169 then had a lot of those air-conditioned Hinos, from what I remember. I also recall seeing an air-conditioned Hino bus at the bus stop near Chong Pang City along Sembawang Road, though I cannot remember whether that was before or after route 169 was amended (if it was after, then was it route 167 (unlikely - never recalled these buses on that route) or the old 160? Or could it had been 856?)</p>
              <p>Talking about route 169, I faintly recall that the CAC-style Japanese buses did not come in until at least just before or after the Yishun amendment; I still recall a trip on route 169 from Ang Mo Kio to Chong Pang City (obviously before the amendment) on an non air-conditioned Nissan U31SCN or R87 (?) - the bus had a jacknife (folding) door at the exit instead of the usual sliding door. At that time, there was nary an air-conditioned bus on route 169 (other than probably a few Mercedes MB O405s that eluded me). After the amendment, the air-conditioned Hinos seemed to be everywhere on this route; they disappeared (later I would know they went to CSS) and were replaced by the new Malaysian-made Dennis Lance buses sometime in 1997 or 1998. At that time, they still used plastic destos instead of the flip-dot displays, and I suspect that the destos they used were the same as the ones used during the days of air-conditioned Hinos on route 169 (remember, the air-conditioned Hinos used plastic destos similar to most SBS Transit buses today).</p>
              <p>In those days, the bus models that intrigued me the most were the CAC-style Japanese buses; I found them odd as they had NAC-style windows and yet were air-conditioned. After the 1995-1996 rationalisation, besides route 169, I recall at least one of the Hinos on route 187 (although someone pointed out once a long time ago that I might had mis-remembered things, but I feel that it may had been a cameo); route 169 had the CAC Nissans complementing the air-conditioned Hinos too. Several of the Nissans also had their air-conditioning unit switched off (permenantly?) and served as non air-conditioned buses on several Yishun bus routes; routes 800 and 854 were among the ones I recall, and someone once had a ticket of one of those buses showing it to be running on route 851. I also recall seeing a suspected CAC Nissan on route 171; did any of those buses ever serve that route?</p>

              When 857 was introduced in 1993, the CAC Nissans were first deployed on 857. There were no MB O405s on 857 perm but it do appear as cameos. However, when a few of the OAC Nissans were redeployed to 857, the CAC became SP for a while and cameo on PAC services like 851 &amp; 854. Some of the OAC Nissans were transferred to KJDEP as well, when newer MB O405s were being deployed on 851 &amp; 854.<br><br>For your 2nd question, the bus stop you mentioned was newly built for 857. Not only that, but the bus stops O/S Blk 1002 (now demolished) were also used by 857.

              <p>Currently, yes. Only the Malaysian Dennis Lance buses have these "furry" panelling, at least in regards to public buses.</p>
              <p>I do remember that several other air-conditioned buses used to have them, such as SBS Transit's (then SBS') Mercedes MB O405 buses before refurbishment. I also remembered that the Duple-Mestec bodied version had two versions of it's interior: both had the "furry" panelling if I remember correctly, but one had non-adjustable air-conditioning slit vents (if you want to know what they looked like, think of the vents in today's SMRT's Mercedes OC500LE or Habit-bodied MB O405G, minus the rotary lever and jutting out, and positioned closer to the celling), while the other had round adjustable ones similar to the ones all of them have today. Were the differences based on the model of the air-conditioning unit they had?</p>

              <p><br>When 857 was introduced in 1993, the CAC Nissans were first deployed on 857. There were no MB O405s on 857 perm but it do appear as cameos. However, when a few of the OAC Nissans were redeployed to 857, the CAC became SP for a while and cameo on PAC services like 851 &amp; 854. Some of the OAC Nissans were transferred to KJDEP as well, when newer MB O405s were being deployed on 851 &amp; 854.<br><br>For your 2nd question, the bus stop you mentioned was newly built for 857. Not only that, but the bus stops O/S Blk 1002 (now demolished) were also used by 857.</p>

              <p><br>I remembered riding on a CAC Nissan U31 SCN on service 825 way back in 1993 and it was the first Tibs aircon bus ride for me as well. Think most of the CAC SCNs were then transferred to KJDEP when AMDEP had the new Merc 0405 buses.</p>
              <p>To add on service 169 when converted to PAC in 1995, there were a mixture of MB0405s and Nissan U31RCNs on service 169. Some CAC Nissan U31SCNs and Hinos made cameo appearances too.</p>

              Initially the Dennis Lance, CSS310U, also used blue 608 destos.

              <p>Several of the Nissans also had their air-conditioning unit switched off (permenantly?) and served as non air-conditioned buses on several Yishun bus routes; routes 800 and 854 were among the ones I recall, and someone once had a ticket of one of those buses showing it to be running on route 851. I also recall seeing a suspected CAC Nissan on route 171; did any of those buses ever serve that route?</p>

              <p><br>Yup, TIB311K to TIB317U were converted to NAC buses somewhere in 1996. The aircon was just swithced off that's all. There were also some Hinos (TIB38x series) as well as TIB390G which were also converted to NAC buses, however they were transferred to CSS in 1997 and were reverted back to AC once again.</p>
              <p>TIB311K to TIB317U were among some buses to transfer from KJDEP to AMDEP when all the NAC Hinos were all given to KJDEP in late 1997. After which those Nissans were running around as spare buses cameoing on AMDEP services at that time.</p>
