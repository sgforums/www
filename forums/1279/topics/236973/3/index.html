Volvo like those striders and DM 3500. Those drivers who are very tall, seems to bend their back to be able to look out. As the windscreen seems to be quite low and the driver seats was very high!

Hence the windscreen goes so low, and why the driver's cab is high in a B10M.  Why do you think the Alexander PS body was still produced on Mk IV B10Ms in the UK????

AFAIK, it is rated for 18 tonnes GVM, which is hardly light.  the B10M chassis is also used in coaches.  You find me O.405 coaches which are as numerable as the B10M coach.  You'd struggle, BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE!  Why don't you learn to back up your statements with facts?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah..i agree with Windy_Loves_B10TL..haha..A Volvo B10M is definitely more stable than a Merc O405..The engine in a B10M is placed horizontally in the middle of the bus between the 2 axles! The engine in the Merc O405 is placed at the back of the bus. The only reason why some people would think the Merc is more stable than the Volvo is because the suspension of the Merc is more supple than the suspension of thr B10M, which is very crashy..</div>

If you throw the hammer up into the air, the hammer head part, which is the heaviest part of the whole hammer, will always wants to fall first.

This also applies to rear engined buses. If the bus speeds and turns, the heavier rear part with the engine, may cause the back of the bus to be "pushed" sideways, causing the bus to be out of control. However, if the engine is positioned in the middle, the weight is distributed evenly and the chances of the bus being "pushed" out is lessened.<br><br>In other words, the heavier rear part of rear engined buses will have a greater inertia at the rear when turning, as compared with mid-engined buses.</div>

U are riding a bicycle, then u 'tompang' a big and heavy person at the back, but you are light urself... then speed along a straight road and make a sharp turn, the bicycle will confirm lose control and topple, because the back of the bicycle has a greater inertia than the front. So the front is turning, but the back wants to go straight, therefore causing the bus(bike in this case) to steer out...But dont worry when u take a rear engined bus, you wont encounter such situations, unless the BC speeds like a speed demon, say 180km/h? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Only porsche adopts the rear-engined layout for it's 911..that's why a 911 is more prone oversteers (I think this is what Scania N113CRB luver is trying to say instead of "steer outs") or more commonly known as drifting..hehe..Ferraris and Lamborghinis are super stable, the only way they will drift/oversteer is when u release the accelerator in the middle of a turn..Thus a mid-engined Volvo B10M will definitely be more stable than a rear-engined Merc O405..<br><br>NOW imagine it is raining heavily and there is a B10M and O405 both wanting to turn a corner fast because the green arrow is already flashing, the O405 will definitely be more prone to oversteer than the B10M because of inertia..the engine at the back of the merc has inertia (which means the reluctance to accelerate or reluctance to deccelerate) and the engine won't want to change direction much, thus the rear of the O405 will "push out" wide and cause it to oversteer and lose control..but in the B10M, yes the engine has inertia too, but it is placed horizontally (not vertically, most cars engines are placed vertically, so when it horizontal, it's centre of gravity is even lower, thus more stable) and in between the 2 axles, thus the inertia of the engine is cancelled out..making a B10M more stable..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Actually, the reason why horizontal engines are used on both B10M and O405 is not because of having a lower centre of gravity like what Subaru claims, instead since the engine is horizontal or "pancake", theres no need for extra space/room for underfloor equipment, which explains why B10M has a horizontal engine. If the B10M were to have a horizontal engine, the platform height would be so high due to the need for space for underfloor equipment that its platform height would almost same to those tourist coaches. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Buses that are fully low floor, but uses vertical engines, has the engine placed in transverse position, in order to enable full low floor. An example is the N113CRB (altho not low floor), its engine was placed in transverse position, meaning engine is parallel to the axle. Another example of low floor buses with vertical engines placed in transverse position is the B9TL.</div>

It maybe the jerking problem but most of this bus do not had hard jerking problem after they are maintained well. Those DM 3500 and Strider were one of my favourite too, they are very stable. Sometimes, when you board DM 3500, you can hear the metal bars under the bus when it passes by those uneven road! This sound can be found on SBS 276Y, I think the only bus that has the same metal sound produced below the bus. Sometimes I thought that I was onboard a DM 3500! So, I also think that the stability of the bus matters a lot, especially when you are taking in a long distance journey.

If it is a light weight chassis, it wouldn't be used for citybus work. AFAIK, it is rated for 18 tonnes GVM, which is hardly light. the B10M chassis is also used in coaches. You find me O.405 coaches which are as numerable as the B10M coach. You'd struggle, BECAUSE THERE ARE NONE!
