Thank you for pointing out that Scania have no TV mobile.<br>Its much better riding on a bus without TV mobile. You like TV mobile, take your mercz with TV Mobile. I dont like so I take my buses without TV mobile.<br>FYI: The "Unique" Seating arrangement of a Scania. ( A bench seat over the wheel ) is to give commuters more leg room when seating over the wheel arch. Although I suggest you take SMRT's UD to feel how it looks like seating in<br>a CRAMPED seat above the wheel arch.<br>Mercz. 10.3M long bus.Ehh Wait is it 9.3M ? Checked. 11.6M Some seats were removed to compensate for the lack of space. Oh and FYI. Not all mercz got TV Mobile.<br><br>Oh ya... as far as I remember, Soon Lee does not have Scania CRBs. Neither does BNL (Unless Cameo, since the 30 S Shift Scania CRBs are replaced). So you can put your mind at ease that Scania CRB wont appear there frequently.<br><br>And Scanias are great for feeder routes and hilly routes. Their Great accelration and torquey engine gives them the edge over the B10M MK IIIs and Mercz.<br><br>Oh Ya, I have taken SBS286T and seen one guy falling. Its not the Bus. Its the person who never hold the grip properly.<br><br>Based on newspaper Reports, "I", SBS1985C  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , was on Service 30 and when I did an Emergency Brake, I made a girl fall down and slide <strong>ALL THE WAY</strong><br>to the front. So is SBS1985C a Scania? Is SBS286T a Scania? No. And people do not fall down because the bus they took is a Scania.<br><br>P.S. Looks who arguing <strong>KID</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>I hope I can be a kid.. hehez... oh..Mmm.. Tv mobile sometimes maybe nosey... BUT, if you can see news or some drama or even movies in the bus would be gd. BTW, today I brought my colleagues to take public transport . One from England and one from Hong Kong. Concidentally, we took one scania bus ( i think is SBS 3682 M..) on svc 33 and one mercz  (SBS 3728R) on svc 502 in the morning! I asked them which bus was more comfortable? The English man replied me, SBS 3728R was more comfortable as he commented that the bus aircon was cooler. Then, the HK man says, he felt that SBS 3728R looks cleaner and the bus seems to be more stable when it is moving on the rd. He added that in HK, he mostly only able to take the DD and not single deck, he did not taken such single deck bus except the "Xiao ba" . I asked him, if you are taking a long distance and premium service like Express 502, which one would you prefer? The HK man says he would prefer SBS 3728R then SBS 3682M.. Hmm..No wonder no express services uses scania. I thought they accelerate very gd? should be deploy on this express svc that uses expressway! Oops? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I think Express 518 had scania on this service before rite?

When BRAM transferred these buses to BN, the Mercz took over the Scania in Feeder duities. These<br>Ex BRAM Scanias are now doing either Feeder Services or Trunk Services that are under the control of BNDEP (EG: SBS3668E, SBS3693G Perm BNDEP 8 ).<br>Next.There are 700 Mercz in SBST Fleet. 200 Scania in SBST Fleet.<br>Of course Mercz will appear on more services (Inc Premium).Not surprising for 502 since SLBP is dominated by Mercz. Unlike BNDEP with have a good number of MK III and MK IVs. In Fact. Almost Every SBST Bus Interchange will have a service with perm O405.<br>Next. Like you said. Scania have good acceleration. Thus, they should be<br>placed on Stop and Go services (like feeder) where their great acceleration and braking power will be put to good use.<br>518 only has one perm Scania. SBS2888T Swapped with SBS1688K that is now in HGDEP.<br><br>Before you tell me SBST bought more Mercz than Scania as the performance of Mercz was better, I wish to tell you that the reason I can think of is that Scanias were much more expensive than Mercz.<br><br>IMO. Its not really fair. You took The Scania is on a normal trunk svc and the Mercz on a premium Express service. Of course the ride on the Scania would not be so pleasant.<br><br>If you have noticed, most new coaches are Scania (EG: DuckTours' new DD).<br>And, An excellent BC can adapt to any bus that he/she is driving. Be It Dennis, Mercz, Scania or Volvo.<br><br>P.S. To Each His/Her Own. You like Mercz, take as many as you can. Avoid Scania if you do not like them. They will be gone for good around the same period of time. And Avoid areas dominated by Scania although there will be a good number of MK IIIs there too... As for me, I cannot avoid Mercz as they are EVERYWHERE! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I shall end my post with this.<br><br>-~PEACE~-</div>

This is because they are the same chassis, just one is a low floor citybus, the other is a stepped entrance citybus.  N113CRB/CRLs have a longitudinally-mounted engine (east-west or horizontally opposed or "boxer" as they are also known).
