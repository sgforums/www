They are underpowered lah, engine not powerful enough, thats why cannot speed. Tridents cannot speed got problem liao. 305bhp leh, surely it can speed?<br><br>What i meant is that VSO being underpowered, the addition of the Voith gearbox made it even slower ( in acceleration, not top speed.But some people say VSO also cannot speed well) . That's why some people i talked to says that "VSOs with Voith? Oh no, i dont want! I prefer them to have ZF instead." Voith buses can speed lah!

Why mercs is best? You can try this, try to sit at those seats that are behind the drivers (those green seats). You can hardly hear the engine sound from there, the whole bus seems to be very stable. You also can hear the "Pss..ss" sound when the brake is released.  Mercs also had easy setting to operate the bus. Compared to volvo which locate their engine on the front. Volvo like those striders and DM 3500. Those drivers who are very tall, seems to bend their back to be able to look out. As the windscreen seems to be quite low and the driver seats was very high! The worst would be those scania. OMG, I think they are too light and tend to shake a lot. When it passes by those road that were irregular, they would shake hardly and may cause you to puke!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion of SBS Scania N113CRB stands , they are the last buses I ever want to take for long journey. I rather take UDs. (Yes no kidding) . The braking is horrendous (Dennis Lance is the worst) , the engine when changing gear can be very hard (Some buses) and the suspension ( due to light body ) is terrible.<br><br>Despite all these problems, I hope to see SBST buying new scanias to replace(these buses should have left years ago) these mediocue buses. (NAC is excluded)<br><br></div>

Scania have their engine at the back but their radiator is at the side. The MB has a good good pickup but it's noisy especially at the exterior. Volvo engine is not at the front, it's located in the middle for equal weight distribution. I still like the mk3 and mk4 though because they can go very fast.</div>
