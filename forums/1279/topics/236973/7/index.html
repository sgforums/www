BUT u still do not have a defintely ans to tell me why SBST brought more mercz then scania. Excuse me, the different were about 500 over buses! It could be understandable when the different were 5 or 20 but it was not! BTW, I just found out that comparing mercz from scania. Mercz looks nicer in the interior and the exterior!</div></blockquote>Both SBST Scanias and WA Mercz and WA B10M MK II are built by the same body builder company, Walter Alexander. So naturally, they have almost similar bodyworks.(WA PS) Or are you comaparing the DM Mercz? Interior is decided by SBST on how they want to arrange the seats.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>BTW: To each his/her own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The price is definitely for the N113s. Prices for current Scanias I do not know.<br><br>Multiply the difference in cost by 500. That will give you your answer as why SBST bought much more Mercz than Scania.<br>This is just one thread I managed to dig up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>20K just for a Air Con unit for Scania OAC.<br><br>Another reason is that Scanias are harder to mantain than mercz.
