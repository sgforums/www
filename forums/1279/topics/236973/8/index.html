            <div class='col-md body'>While I spend my years in the automotive engineering sector, I went into many types of vehicles. However the one that would most likely accompany me longest are buses.<br><br>I'd like to comment that buses are actually the most sophisticated vehicles I've ever managed. Of course, there'd be definately some that people prefers some that people do not.<br><br>My personal favourite is the Mercedes Benz. Way back in the days when I was still in the military, I have always prefered Mercedes Benz over Landrover in the light chassis category. Even in the medium chassis category, the Mercedes Benz Unimog is aways my choice over FIAT or IVECO. Now in the bus business, Mercedes Benz O405 is still my favourite over Volvo and Leylands. I'd anytime prefer a Mercedes over any Volvo or Leyland. Even when I was purchasing a car recently, I did think of the Mercedes Benz A class 1.7L but got a Peugeot instead due to price.<br><br>The reason is because:<br>(1) Mercedes Benz is very simple &amp; straight forward to understand. Therefore making maintenance easy and fast. And therefore helps to put buses on the road earlier. And you all have to wait lesser. Complicated parts doesn't necessary mean higher technology. Being simple yet gives the same outcome is the true high technology.<br>(2) Operates on mostly separate entities. Unlike Volvo which links almost everything together. If my steering is heavy, it can be due to anything from gearbox to cooling system.<br>(3) Cheap if you know how to buy the parts. And plenty of room for technical modifications to suit different usage.<br>(4) Light and powerful. The engine does not require a turbo to operate the vehicle to give magnificent performance. Do not always think turbo charged is good. If you are knowledgable enough, you'll appreciate superchargers or those non power charged engines yet giving comparable performance standards.<br>(5) Finally, a hot favourite amongst SL Depot BC.<br><br>Of course there're always strong competitors. One I've heard of is Scania. The performance and technology particularly lifespan is lengendary as I've heard mainly good feedbacks from other depots. But if in future, SBST decides to buy any of them to use as replacement for single decks, doesn't mean that bus is better. However, as technical personnel, I have to concede that whatever the company buys regardless it's a good or bad decision, I must always tell the company I will maintain it.<br><br>Also, despite having 1st hand experience and knowledge eagerly contributed by suppliers in exchange for businesses from the company, I still think that I do not know too much to learn more. I maintain a fleet of 400 over buses of several makes, trained in both technical and theoretical aspects, pioneers &amp; design several technical projects, leads a engineering component overhaul section, fight several technical wars internal and external inclusive of warranty claims, be part of the management on both technical and financial aspects of an actual workshop, I still feel that I'm still green to be able to start firing at anyone in a forum who's even greener.<br><br>I urger you all who're really interested into engineering to pick up an engineering diploma/degree and join this industry. Make your voice heard. Be the one to make decisions instead of suggestions. Make this your full time job. Fuelled with passion &amp; driven by knowledge, you'll surely contribute tremendously to the industry.</div>

Even tho SBST's Merc are non-turbo charged, it still packs a punch. The engine seems really powerful to me.
