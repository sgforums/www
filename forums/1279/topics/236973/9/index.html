If it goes too fast, it will start to wobble. If you would recount the many bus accidents that occured on the highways, you will  find that they are mostly the Hino AK or RK. The Hino RM has better control and more comfy too as it has air suspension. The newer Nissans (eg. JP251S, or something like that) are smooth riders too. But alas, the Jap buses lose out trememdously to the Scanias and MANs who can easily outrun them.<br><br>The best coaches in MY I would say, are the Scanias. Smooth, stable and very fast. The MAN is comparable in power but not as smooth and the engine is loud. For MB, the 1627L are still the best.</div>

Now, I'm back in Singapore. During the 4 months there, I have experienced many types of buses. I work and live in Zug Canton, one of the smallest Cantons (province) in Switzerland. The buses I usually ride to and from work was the Scania N94UB 4x2, MB O405G or O530. Other buses include the Scania L94UB 6x2, MB O405 and O530G, NAW and a pair of Volvo B10M and B7L.<br><br>Luzern also have a wide variety of buses. Among them are the MBO405N/N2, MB Citaro(G), MAN NG313, Scania L94UA, Volvo B10M(A), B10LA, Irisbus EuroPolis and 1 or 2 Neoplan buses of unknown model. Luzern has a network of trolleybuses, manufactured by NAW-Siemens-Hess. I didn't get a chance to catch the new 23m bi-articulated trolleybus (Vossloh-Hess). Tourist coaches abound in Luzern and I have spotted the MAN Lionstar, VanHool, Neoplan, Bova, Setra etc.<br><br>Another city that I visited was Zurich. Zurich has an extensive network of trams in addition to the MBO405GTZ trolleybus. I rode the oldest trams, made in 1967 with wooden seats, as well as the latest model, designed by Pininfarina. Riding the tram is quite a fascinating experience. Zurich is also where I had my first ride on a Neoplan bus, the Centroliner, which is quite abundant here. I also bumped across a MAN Lion's City in one of its suburbs.<br><br>It was very fascinating and I enjoyed my joyrides in Switzerland. I have seen what the buses are really capable of and dispel many of the myths. A real eye opener.</div>

From my boss, subordinates, suppliers etc. The moment I think I am qualified to put down someone with insult, I'd be done for. So my learning curve must always have a gradient in order to keep upgraded. There will always be someone good enough to show me that there's a higher mountain greener pasture out there.<br><br>This also applies to everyone. We all make stupid mistakes and remarks.

Now, I'm back in Singapore. During the 4 months there, I have experienced many types of buses. I work and live in Zug Canton, one of the smallest Cantons (province) in Switzerland. The buses I usually ride to and from work was the Scania N94UB 4x2, MB O405G or O530. Other buses include the Scania L94UB 6x2, MB O405 and O530G, NAW and a pair of Volvo B10M and B7L.<br><br>Luzern also have a wide variety of buses. Among them are the MBO405N/N2, MB Citaro(G), MAN NG313, Scania L94UA, Volvo B10M(A), B10LA, Irisbus EuroPolis and 1 or 2 Neoplan buses of unknown model. Luzern has a network of trolleybuses, manufactured by NAW-Siemens-Hess. I didn't get a chance to catch the new 23m bi-articulated trolleybus (Vossloh-Hess). Tourist coaches abound in Luzern and I have spotted the MAN Lionstar, VanHool, Neoplan, Bova, Setra etc.<br><br>Another city that I visited was Zurich. Zurich has an extensive network of trams in addition to the MBO405GTZ trolleybus. I rode the oldest trams, made in 1967 with wooden seats, as well as the latest model, designed by Pininfarina. Riding the tram is quite a fascinating experience. Zurich is also where I had my first ride on a Neoplan bus, the Centroliner, which is quite abundant here. I also bumped across a MAN Lion's City in one of its suburbs.<br><br>It was very fascinating and I enjoyed my joyrides in Switzerland. I have seen what the buses are really capable of and dispel many of the myths. A real eye opener.</div></blockquote>I love the Ciratos in Luzern. Too bad I didn't know you were there when i went there for holiday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is very easy to go bus joyriding in Switzerland. All you have to do is to buy a 1 day pass, get a free copy of the bus timetable and you're all set. Just be sure you stay within the stated fare zones and you'll be OK. You don't have to show your pass to the driver. Just hop on board from any door, sit down and relax. You open the door yourself except for the front door which is controlled by the driver. But before you get any ideas about free rides, be warned. Travelling without a valid ticket is subject to a CHF80 (S$101.6) fine.</div>
