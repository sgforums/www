Actually, the reason why horizontal engines are used on both B10M and O405 is not because of having a lower centre of gravity like what Subaru claims, instead since the engine is horizontal or "pancake", theres no need for extra space/room for underfloor equipment, which explains why B10M has a horizontal engine. If the B10M were to have a horizontal engine, the platform height would be so high due to the need for space for underfloor equipment that its platform height would almost same to those tourist coaches. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Buses that are fully low floor, but uses vertical engines, has the engine placed in transverse position, in order to enable full low floor. An example is the N113CRB (altho not low floor), its engine was placed in transverse position, meaning engine is parallel to the axle. Another example of low floor buses with vertical engines placed in transverse position is the B9TL.</div></blockquote>What about Dennis Dart? I think there is a version called SLF, but it uses a vertical engine. You can see the engine bay from the interior.</div>

However, the back of the bus is "raised" to accomodate underfloor equipment as well as the engine. If im not wrong, the new B9L should be fully low floor, like the Citaro. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> FYI, the engine of B9L is also vertical....only the D12E 12 litre engine used by the B12M and B12BLE is horizontal.... Also, most of MBs low floor buses uses horizontal engines...Infact, i can say that all low floor city buses that MB supplies uses horizontal engines...(citybuses, not coaches). 7 ( or is it 6?) litre OM906hLA , used by Citaro and OC500LE/LF and OM457hLA , used by Citaro/ CitaroG and OC500LE/LF as well as the CNG engine OM447hLAG, used by Citaro/ CItaroG and OC500LE/LF as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The MB O405 was never intended as a coach. In the beginning of the 1980s, the German Ministry of Transport promoted the development of a new modern city and intercity bus. In response, Mercedes-Benz presented the 11.5 metre long O405 citybus in 1983. Production for the series started in 1984. The O405G was presented in 1986. The low-floor versions, O405N/O405GN were presented in 1989. These were further improved in 1993-94, by having its seats in the front section lowered so that it is attached to the floor and not on platforms like its predecessor. The new variants are called O405N2/O405GN2.<br><br>The B10M, on the other hand, was developed as a multi-purpose bus. It is suitable for city, intercity, suburban or interstate services.<br><br>There was a thread about the weight of buses and I had posted the unladen weights of a B10M and an O405 (sourced from the SBST webpage), which are:<br><br>B10M Strider: 10370<br>Mk III : 10300<br>WA O405: 9550<br><br>It is clear that the B10M is not lighter than the O405, nor does it have a light chassis (unless you consider 10 tons as light?) as claimed by our chicken friend. So, I would suggest our friend to stop embarrassing him/herself further. The superior man, recognising his faults, corrects them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You were talking about specifics aren't you? So I'm just suggesting that you include hairs in your variables since hairs have weight and they make a difference too! And would you think someone who is 7-years-old can command such good english? Look at what you typed above. In just 2 sentences you made 2 mistakes, and that's when I'm lenient about it. "Hahaz"? What's that? An alien word? "You talk like my nephew who "WAS" about 7-years-old". Oh, are you telling me, forgive for saying, your nephew has already passed away? Shouldn't it be "You talk like my nephew who "IS" about 7-years-old"? Go figure, my dear unborn friend.</div></blockquote>Can you people stop arguing like kids?!!</div>

Does gd accleration needed when you drive along JW west st 41/east? Where you gotta stop almost every 50m.</div>
