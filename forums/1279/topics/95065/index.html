How about doing up one with photoshop and see how it looks?<br><br>We can also use photoshop to paint an LP1113 or OF1417 in modern SBST livery, or one of those old Hino RK176 in SMRTB scheme. How about a Habit in Comfortbus colours? I'd bet it will look many times better than the plain ugly SMRTB red. And yeah the ex-CSS U31R's REALLY look like one of those U31SCN's previously in old SBS colours. Ugly. I actually mistook one of them for an SBS U31SCN if not for the realisation that SBST have scrapped all of them.</div>

Anyhow, I still have to take another bus within Hougang to get to 854, and when it reaches Yishun, gotta change to another bus again! Two transfers for a bus trip is kinda ridiculous in today's day and age, isnt it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Woodlands recently got slightly better due to the two express buses introduced by both companies from Hougang, but yeah, two transfers are still needed. I am quite happy that they are express services thou, so I dont mind.</div>

Dublication actually helps the customer, isnt it? You get to choose, and you get more bus routes going the same way...meaning higher overall frequencies!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

When two companies offer the same bys route, they still have to take into account actual demand along it, which obviously dosent neccesarily multiply by two with two routes. The demand is shared, and they will have to adjust and reduce their frequencies if need be in response.<br><br>If they were to do the uneconomical thing of offering an increase in frequency despite low demand, and try to charge higher fares, then a price war can result, with each companuy under-cutting the other to gain more passengers. The result is that both comapnies end up having to keep their prices low anyway. In some cases, they might get into a cartel and both raises fares to the same level, undermining the basics of open competition, and which I assume is the main problem you are refering to. Of coz, both are only possible provided there is no governmental intervention and the like.<br><br>But of coz, I was refering to the current state of affairs here, with governmental control over certain aspects such as pricing. It almost always helps to have more then one route to take from point A to B, which I assume most of us would have discovered in our daily journeys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dont you think those instances are more of the exception rather then the norm, as I said earlier? In fact, howmany of these services actually have an extended length of their routes being directly dublicated, like the one between 25 and 854, which is what I would consider a rare example of some competition, albeit only in the Hougang-Bedok sector.<br><br>When I refer to true blue competition, I envisage a situation whereby both bus companies are free to run any route to any destination. We cant possibly claim that we have competition when, for example, we still have bus companies monopolising (or close to it) bus interchanges and terminals!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>competition for the sake of competition (esp. in a small market like ours) is self-destructive.<br>the tv stations may be one example with both bleeding millions over the past four years. for a business, the bottomline (profits/losses) is the priority.<br>another example would be the low-cost carriers...tiger,airasia, jetstar asia, valuair (even though not strictly lcc), thai airasia, merpati, lion air......good for consumers initially, but from the examples in europe, unsustainable in the long run and leading to company closure and job losses. lccs are willing to undercut even the cost price of a seat to "compete" with rivals. probably strategically competitive, but financially ruinous.<br><br>having said that, i think the present situation is just nice...both smrt and sbstransit are still making profits *overall*. we still have some choice. my mom remembers a time when there was NO tibs...people were simpler then..they just wanted to get from point A to point B...without arguing over whether there was a monopoly or not, or competition for the sake of competition.</div>
