              <p> I believe the highest peak loading will be at 6.30am to 6.50am. I can tell u it will be flooded with Admiralty Sec, Riverside Pri and Greenwood Pri and the return trip will be flooded with workers going to work alighting at Admiralty station and the pax will plummet after Admiralty station</p>

              <p>There's still quite a handfull of them on the way from 7:05am onwards. It's quite packed because it connects to Adm Sec + Still far from the late coming time. </p>
              <p>7:05am onwards situation :<br>If 904 really can reach the sch fast, then people would already take it rather than 964, nobody wants to walk a distance. But you got to consider the journey time.</p>
              <p>Rough Example :<br>Presume it always take 2-3mins on average to turn to Blk683A, that's about 7:12-7:14am. Traffic wise probably 1min to turn into Dr63/73. Further down, at another traffic[Ave7xCresent], that's about 2mins. Total time would be around 7:15am-7:17am. Don't forget there's loading at some stops. Presume the bus would take 7:15am time, plus loading, do you think you will make it to sch in time?</p>
              <p>Anyway, only 1/2 ppl are from Adm Sec just nw(my morning ride). 913 n 904 bunch up also, but it happen that there are more Adm Sec on 913. [I took 913 &gt; 904]</p>
