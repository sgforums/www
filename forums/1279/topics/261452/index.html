            <div class='col-md body'>Just took SBS 165 J on perm service 54. Engine sounds like stuck in first gear, eg when the bus accelerates, it's one continuous sound, unlike other buses, where you can hear the gears changing. Sorry for my poor explanation, but I don't really know how to put it. Let's just say that it sounds a bit like the Darts' Allison gearbox. What is it that causes the difference in the sound of the acceleration? Actually SBS 140 E also had the same sound when I took it last December, but it seems to have been fixed.<br><br>(Off topic: Despite the problem, the BC still chiong like nobody's business, and the engine was roaring loud <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )</div>

I wonder 1131G has been fixed.<br><br>Jerks are seldom though. Gear crunching (abrupt transmission from 2nd to 3rd due to tardiness) and a audible knock when 2nd gear is engaged (when slipping signs occur) are more common. When slippage finally happens, there are surprisingly no jerks, the transmission appears to be even smoother!<br><br>When the Volgren 1187X had slippage, the entire Woodlands Int can hear the revving when it leaves a berth as though something is stuck. It was fixed in less than 2-3 months, probably due to the noise.<br><br>I have only seen a Voith breaking down, that is TIB 1193C. The same tardiness when switching to 2nd gear, and over 2 weeks of neglect the gearbox gave up completely. The last night before the bus went for repairs, it ran only at 1st gear for the full feeder journey.<br><br>I feel SBST fleet is better in this area, although i take them less frequently. Except for early Leyland buses that are starting to age.</div>

The bus has smooth gear shifting .<br><br>Tok abt TIB543H , it did have gear slippage when i took it last time . Tink it occurred when shifting from gear 3 to 4 . The gearbox kinda becomes "neutral" and the engine rev quite hard , then suddenly kicks into 4th gear .<br><br>SBS1991J have this problem . It jerks like hell . That time took it on 66 by chance , and it had similar problems that i had mentioned earlier for TIB543H . When the bus shifts from gear 3 to 4, the gearbox kinda become "neutral" then suddenly kicks into 4th gear , HARD . It sounds like "wahhhhh....PANG!" ...The whole bus jerks violently . I wonder if it has been fixed noe .</div>
