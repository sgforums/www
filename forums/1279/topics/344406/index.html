              <p>I saw this article at,  <a href="http://voices.todayonline.com/letter/EDC090114-0000001/bed_bugs_on_bus.html">http://voices.todayonline.com/letter/EDC090114-0000001/bed_bugs_on_bus.html</a></p>
              <p><em>Bed bugs on bus<br>January 14, 2009</em></p>
              <p><em>Letter from Cheah Boon Loon<br>IN JANUARY last year, I travelled on SMRT’s bus Service 61. After the bus ride, I experienced extreme itchiness in my mid-torso and I noticed a series of insect bites. I assumed it was some allergy and paid no attention to it, but minutes later, another series of extremely itchy insect bites started to appear around my chest. </em></p>
              <p><em>In the end I caught a tiny insect which I later confirmed was the nymph of a bed bug. I had to seek medical advice as apparently I am allergic to bed bug bites and the bites swelled up considerably. </em></p>
              <p><em>I submitted my feedback to SMRT informing them of the infestation on that bus and requested they clean out the bus to eliminate the bed bugs. The customer relations officer informed me that the bus would be scheduled “back to the depot for a thorough check on its cleanliness”. </em></p>
              <p><em>Aware that bed bug infestations can occur on seemingly clean places, I told the officer that merely scheduling the bus back was unacceptable as many more passengers could have travelled on the bus before it returned to the depot, and meanwhile the infestation could spread. I was brushed off and they insisted on keeping the bus in service until it was due back for cleaning. </em></p>
              <p><em>On Dec 17, I again experienced a series of bed bug bites on my neck after travelling on SMRT bus Service 853. This time, it was an adult bed bug (see attached picture) that was the culprit. </em></p>
              <p><em>Again I informed SMRT of the bed bug infestation, making reference to the earlier complaint. There was no response to my latest feedback from SMRT. </em></p>
              <p><em>On Dec 22, I decided to escalate the matter by writing to the Public Transport Council (PTC). Kudos to PTC for replying to my feedback on Dec 24, urging SMRT to take relevant actions. However, to date — more than half a month later — I have yet to get any response from SMRT. </em></p>
              <p><em>The impression I got from this public transport service provider is that customer feedback is not taken very seriously. </em></p>
              <p><em>Bed bug infestations can be a nightmare to control. In some countries, if a customer suffers bed bug bites from a service rendered (such as in hotels or on public transport), the service provider will be held liable and open to legal action, and the necessary hotel room or vehicle will be taken out of service to ensure infestation does not spread. </em></p>
              <p><em>Why does SMRT condone waiting for its “cleaning schedule” to be met and risk more passengers falling victim to these pests? </em></p>
