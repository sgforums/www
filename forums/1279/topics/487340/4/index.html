              <p>Not good news. I was expecting them to swap out some of the SDs
              on Sv 39 for DDs in the coming month~ Ditto for other SMRT svcs
              like Sv 851.</p>
              <p>At this rate, I think high chance Sv 39 getting another fleet
              add in this Q1 already. Its frequency is worsening drastically in
              both directions during Peak Hours since school season restarted.
              Quite common to see a 20min wait between buses somewhere in either
              direction during Peak Hour since school started this year. It's
              like somehow the loadings for Sv 39 massively increased this
              year. </p>
              <p>And, isn't Sv 39 still in the BSRF scheme? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I think loading on most Yishun bound services has increased (sparing sv 85), given the huge # of BTOs that opened for residency in 2014 and continue to do so in 2015. Even sv 965 loading has gone up. </p>
              <p>As for sv 39, I think they might stick it out for another month and then upgrade 4-5 slots to DD for sure. Right now has only 1 BSEP in its fleet, so quite possible, LTA might give it a DD fleet add in March, once Yishun temp opens. </p>

              <p>Somehow people taking Sv 85 to Sengkang area have abit of alternatives in Sv 965 instead to Sengkang. The frequency for Sv 965 seems to be way better than Sv 85 during Peak from what I can see in reality. </p>

              <p>Very much possible. Just like they added MAN to 187 first, and then in two months, upgraded the slot to E500. </p>
              <p>sv 39 loading has increased, so an additional bus would not be bad. But once the DDs kick in, then maybe there is excess capacity. So I would say, they might wait until March.</p>

              <p>Hi mr not-credible busanalyser, in future please back up your statements like sbs 39 loading increase with real statistics. Things like loading status per day per week over the last few months (Q3 2014) compared to Q4 2014 should be known and data tabulated. If do not have real data, any Tom, dick or Harry can just say such a statement. How good to be true? Definitely cannot be just based on 1 fleeting statement released by you and using other people agreement here to back you up. Has sbs 39 loading really increased or is it the single decked often super crowded sbs 39 made its look like loading increased but actually not? It could be false impression due to the single deck. Nobody can confirm unless you have the actual loading data from the authorities. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Very much possible. Just like they added MAN to 187 first, and
              then in two months, upgraded the slot to E500. </p>
              <p>sv 39 loading has increased, so an additional bus would not be
              bad. But once the DDs kick in, then maybe there is excess capacity.
              So I would say, they might wait until March.</p>

              <p>Just a tip since you seem to be brand new and not someone just with a new id: in this forum, people don't normally divulge their name or where they stay. You also need to not take it personally if people are rude to you, because I have seen many people taking out their frustrations here. Just my two cents :) </p>

              <p>To be honest the actual problem of 39 is not because the SDs cant take the loads but more to scheduling..The svc is one of the most ignored svc of Bndep/Cgbp..A lot of duties without perm BCs..Sometimes just cut a few mins for e front bus and the next one delay 3-5 mins,Voila thus you see many ppl cant board it..Freq no need to say..Just fill the bloody empty slots with BCs and improved the freq then we can see from there.Its aint like 43,45 cases.</p>
              <p>Another suggestion is to give those empty slots to Amdep..At least 3-4 slots from Yishun to Tampines can be done by them</p>

              <p>I know this qn is directed to him, but i'll post my own observations.</p>
              <p>Before this year started (ie last year but before the Holiday schedule kicked in for the sch hols), Sv 39 usually clears the PSR sector in about 15 mins before reaching TPE entrance (PSR Dr 12). Ie, if a bus comes at 0625+ at the first 2 stops along PSR Dr 1, it will be waiting to get onto TPE by around 0640 or so. </p>
              <p>By lately i've observed that since sch restarted, Sv 39 has been clearing the PSR sector in only 20-25mins in the same time period during Peak. It gets worse for any Sv 39 bus that reaches 1st stop of PSR Dr 1 after 0630hrs. </p>
              <p>Idk how the rest would think, but personally, taking 25 mins just to get from one end of PSR to the other is quite jialat imho. </p>
