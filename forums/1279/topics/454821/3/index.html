              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> 67 and 176 survived without DDs under SBS last time. 960 can do it
              as well. Even now 67 and 960 are using more SDs to improve the
              frequencies, and bendies will be useless once DTL is up. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>SBS only need 3 years to build up its double decker fleet in the
              late 70s and early 80s. TIBS use 3 years to familiar with bendy
              buses. It doesn't need a long time to switch to higher capacity
              buses, it is just how much effort that the company wants to put in
              to improve the services. In our context, bendies are not practical
              in our high density city and highly utilised roads and public bus
              infrastructures. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>So you think bendies are better in WRI??? Just look at the jams
              they have created in the alighting berths. Some of the BCs have to
              honk repeatedly just to tell the other bendy buses in front to
              clear the jam in order for their passengers to alight. Some buses
              are even stuck in the berth because of improper parking of the
              bendy buses which cause the trailer part to cause jams. And not
              only just the alighting berths, the boarding berths as well, long
              queues of buses as well, people have to walk a long way to board
              the bus or have to waste time for up till 5 mins before the front
              bendy bus left so that their bus can park and let them board.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>And bendies are not better in filling up during peak hours when
              people don't even want to move in the other half of the bus. Many
              times can take up to 5 to 8 mins, plus if another bendy bus in
              front block the way, it takes up to 10 mins before the bus can
              finally move. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Talking about Yishun Northpoint bus stop, it is the worst
              encounter that many passengers have during morning peak, mostly
              because of bendy buses. Jams, long bus queues, which cause the
              whole bus stop lane to be clogged, messy and inefficient. Because
              of the space that bendy buses take up, it causes a long queue of
              jam all the way to Yishun 10, just because of waiting to filter
              into Yishun Ave 2. Then another long jam again, and have to wait
              all the bendy buses in front to clear off before your BC can open
              the doors and let you alight. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>There are too many services using bendy buses along that
              stretch, 169, 851, 854, 856, 800, 804, 806, 812, 811, 969, which
              cause too much of these jams in the limited space of that bus stop
              during morning peak everyday. If SMRT use double dekers, it will be
              so much better.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> Luckily 858 and 965 do not use bendy buses else
              it will be a nightmare. Fast offloading, I seriously doubt so. I
              have to waste more time instead waiting for the bus queues and jams
              to clear before I can even alight my bus. Situations becomes worse
              when it is raining or the 3rd bus door or EZlink card reader
              malfunctions. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>And it also cause many other problems for that stretch of bus
              stop, where because of these long queues, some buses are stuck in
              the 2nd lane because they can't filter into the bus lane, causing
              jams to other road users behind. Another problem is that these bus
              queues caused by bendy buses cause the services berthed in the
              vertical berths in Yishun interchange to experience more jams and
              waiting times to exit into Yishun Ave 2 because these bendy buses
              blocked their exits to filter into Yishun Ave 2, which affects the
              time travelled for passengers in these services affected, 39, 85,
              852, 853, 855, 857. Some BCs have to honk at these buses to tell
              them to clear off the roads. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> This is just a bus stop in the suburbs.
              It will be much worse in the city areas.</p>
              <p>Inside Yishun interchange, the situation is no better. Honkings
              and jams and queues and parking problems caused by these bendy
              buses. Even AC7 buses can't stand them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> If Yishun interchange can use DDs, problems can be
              solved easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>I think you are just typing for fun without even knowing what
              actually is happening daily...</p>

                  leh faster unloading..example..Well if SMRT were to buy bendies
                  then so be it lor....Actually there's 1 way to just have air con
                  bus int..just install the glass doors and glass then install aircon

              <p>SBS 1000U - I am completely in sync with you on your thoughts on DDs for SMRT and the problems that bendies create especially in city area. If anyone says bendies are better on 190, they are joking or want to be rigid about their opinion as DDs are ANY day better than bendies for 190.</p>
              <p>As a responsible citizen, I would also request not to make statements like "non-Singaporeans" as you must realize whatever Singapore is today is because of expats, tourists and non-Singaporeans, and we must appreciate it. Else it would have been any place like Indonesia and Malaysia but today Singapore has an identity and I am proud of it. Just my thoughts :) </p>

              <p>Yes, but not all of them are non-Singaporeans. There are also BTO flats under construction. <br><br>Currently, the forest beside Yishun Avenue 6 is clearing down..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> The area beside Yishun Park also has been cleared <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> Now, no more greenery in that area..</p>

              <p><br>LOLz... Yes. It is frustrating even as a passenger to be behind a bendy bus coz it takes too much space at the bus stop, increasing the waiting time for the bus behind.</p>

              <p>I don't find frustrating.... So what it takes too much space? Bendies are like that what..DDs and rigids are also a trouble, people just take their own sweet time and hence if behind is a bendy bus of course it takes time.</p>

              <p>also many here would have no taste of what it was like pre MRT era.. all the 12m buses crowding up the bus lane during peak hrs... give you bendy bus... see will cry and see traffic jam at box junction or not</p>
