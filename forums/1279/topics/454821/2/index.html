              <p>Bendies cause a lot of problems to SMRT operations like space and schedling issues. They cause a lot of jams and queues along bus stops and bus interchanges and they take up too much space in depots and interchanges. And they are more complex and costly to maintain and is not suitable for our roads and harsh operations here. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Thus SMRT should use double deckers which many services can be greatly improved without causing jams along bus stops and interchanges and save a lot of parking spaces for more buses instead. One good example is 190, and other services like 61, 106, 176, 184, 804, 806, 812, 851, 854, 857, 900, 901, 902, 903, 912, 913, 960, 969. etc.</p>
              <p>Look at the number of services, SMRT can easily purchase 300 double deckers to solve their problems.</p>

              <p>From your note, it clearly shows that if SMRT wants it can switch to DDs and it will solve a lot of its problems.</p>
              <p>I hate it when 190s and 106s bendies on Orchard road create a long tail of buses. Easily these services can be moved to DDs. Similarly the 960, 851 at Bugis create a havoc. </p>
              <p>The DDs can be parked at Kranji and AMK. I am sure it will also be profitable for SMRT in long run. </p>
              <p>There is no need to completely remove bendies from its fleet. Bendies can be continued to use on feeder routes such as 804, 806, 911 etc. and may be on 67 due to height restriction on Dunearn road. </p>
              <p>A good mix of DDs (200#) and bendies can really be good for people living in North West and profitable for SMRT. Are u listening SMRT?? :)</p>

              <p>Bendies have to go sooner and later when their timeline is up.</p>
              <p>Bendies are not suitable for bus interchanges with many high demand feeder services. They cause a lot of jams in the bus interchanges and bus stops with heavy traffic and many services. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> Thus it would be better to switch to full SD and DD fleets which proved to be successful in SBST. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> Services with height restrictions just needs a good frequency of SDs.</p>
              <p>And it is not cost and operational wise to operate so many different kinds of buses. Bus companies need to spend more money for more kind of different spare parts and more different people to operate and maintain the different buses. Not wise for cost efficiency for profitable business to sustain.</p>

              <p>Actually bothe have pros and cons lah..DD for people sometimes people take their own sweet time to alight lor yeah but for bendies leh faster unloading..example..Well if SMRT were to buy bendies then so be it lor....Actually there's 1 way to just have air con bus int..just install the glass doors and glass then install aircon but also expensive lah ofc..</p>
              <p>Aye bendies for high demand services can already.</p>

              Airport is more of the bay not the bend. 
              
              Anyway, past few days alrdy see even SMRT SL tulan with bendy bus. Just anyhow alight n board at bus stops thats only meant for 2x 12m. 
              
              Some cases 2nd bus still turn out and pax at bus stop who didnt walk up miss the bus. 
              
              You see, should SMRT buy these buses that even SMRT SL also get tulan??? Lol
              
              They dun want to wait yet co have these buses. 
              
              I think should ask 228 to be SL drive 960.

              <p><br>67 and 176 survived without DDs under SBS last time. 960 can do it as well. Even now 67 and 960 are using more SDs to improve the frequencies, and bendies will be useless once DTL is up. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>SBS only need 3 years to build up its double decker fleet in the late 70s and early 80s. TIBS use 3 years to familiar with bendy buses. It doesn't need a long time to switch to higher capacity buses, it is just how much effort that the company wants to put in to improve the services. In our context, bendies are not practical in our high density city and highly utilised roads and public bus infrastructures. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>So you think bendies are better in WRI??? Just look at the jams they have created in the alighting berths. Some of the BCs have to honk repeatedly just to tell the other bendy buses in front to clear the jam in order for their passengers to alight. Some buses are even stuck in the berth because of improper parking of the bendy buses which cause the trailer part to cause jams. And not only just the alighting berths, the boarding berths as well, long queues of buses as well, people have to walk a long way to board the bus or have to waste time for up till 5 mins before the front bendy bus left so that their bus can park and let them board. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>And bendies are not better in filling up during peak hours when people don't even want to move in the other half of the bus. Many times can take up to 5 to 8 mins, plus if another bendy bus in front block the way, it takes up to 10 mins before the bus can finally move. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Talking about Yishun Northpoint bus stop, it is the worst encounter that many passengers have during morning peak, mostly because of bendy buses. Jams, long bus queues, which cause the whole bus stop lane to be clogged, messy and inefficient. Because of the space that bendy buses take up, it causes a long queue of jam all the way to Yishun 10, just because of waiting to filter into Yishun Ave 2. Then another long jam again, and have to wait all the bendy buses in front to clear off before your BC can open the doors and let you alight. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>There are too many services using bendy buses along that stretch, 169, 851, 854, 856, 800, 804, 806, 812, 811, 969, which cause too much of these jams in the limited space of that bus stop during morning peak everyday. If SMRT use double dekers, it will be so much better.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> Luckily 858 and 965 do not use bendy buses else it will be a nightmare. Fast offloading, I seriously doubt so. I have to waste more time instead waiting for the bus queues and jams to clear before I can even alight my bus. Situations becomes worse when it is raining or the 3rd bus door or EZlink card reader malfunctions. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>And it also cause many other problems for that stretch of bus stop, where because of these long queues, some buses are stuck in the 2nd lane because they can't filter into the bus lane, causing jams to other road users behind. Another problem is that these bus queues caused by bendy buses cause the services berthed in the vertical berths in Yishun interchange to experience more jams and waiting times to exit into Yishun Ave 2 because these bendy buses blocked their exits to filter into Yishun Ave 2, which affects the time travelled for passengers in these services affected, 39, 85, 852, 853, 855, 857. Some BCs have to honk at these buses to tell them to clear off the roads. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> This is just a bus stop in the suburbs. It will be much worse in the city areas.</p>
              <p>Inside Yishun interchange, the situation is no better. Honkings and jams and queues and parking problems caused by these bendy buses. Even AC7 buses can't stand them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> If Yishun interchange can use DDs, problems can be solved easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>Probably if they want to purchase DD they will try to be different from SBST with 3 doors version.The MAN A39 is good but again it's 13.7m and I hope MAN can built a three axles 12.5m 3 doors version.One staircase is enough.AMDEP cannot accommodate DDs as its roof is only 3.9m.Nvm Lor In 2 years Kjdep will shift to Mandai </p>

              <p><br>Never mind if it is 3 door or not. Just get something different from SBST Volvo B9TL, like the Scania K310UD or AD Enviro 500. I think MAN also has a few double decker coach chassis on sale, so maybe they can rope in Gemilang to help SMRT body a double decker bus as stylish as SBS7888T. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>It will be great that SMRT switches to double deckers. I missed the efficiency of using double deckers of certain services, like 61, 106 and particularly 190.</p>

              <p>A smart thing for SMRT to do would be to purchase DDs (as buying
              bendies would be stupid with new BI designs/layouts).</p>
              <p>Existing bendies can service Woodlands / Yishun BIs as it cannot
              accommodate DDs. The bendies from CCK, Bukit Panjang should be
              shifted to WL/Yishun and replaced with DDs.</p>
              <p>DDs should be introduced for BP/CCK/Sembawag BI for routes such
              as 171, 190 amongst others. </p>
              <p>Only this can solve SMRTs voes and give passengers in North /
              West relief. </p>

              <p>In my opinion, Things are still fine though, 171 I don't see the need for DDs or bendies. 190 I feel should stick to bendies.</p>
