              <p>Although our bus routes are matured, I feel that eventually, with new towns opening and major developments, we have to revamp our bus routes, so that we do not have to always have new bus services, while at the same time we can maintain a certain level of bus connectivity.</p>
              <p>Also, like this thread has mentioned, there is not enough space at the bus interchanges and terminals for so many bus services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering if we could have a Larkin Bus Terminal at the city. Larkin Bus Terminal has up to around 87 bus parking lots. It is around 3.65 Hectares. We can build a bus interchange of the same size at Nicoll Highway area by re-routing Republic Avenue to create the 3.65 Hectares of land, since that area is kinda like a wasted space anyway.</p>
              <p>The bus interchange at the city can have bus services that go to every residential town and neighborhoods in Singapore. Singapore has up to around thirty towns (including future towns). We can have around thirty bus services, each runs along the entire city area and connects to every neighborhood in a residential town, running express between the city and the residential town it serves.</p>
              <p>These bus services will then terminate at the interchanges in the residential town they serve, or at a bus interchange/terminal near the residential town. Likewise, this is where the reverse direction starts, and ends at the city.</p>
              <p>The route can be very long (up to 55km), but the travel time can be restricted to a certain duration (up to around 90mins; 1.5hrs), by using bus lanes, major roads, expressways and special traffic lights.</p>
              <p>The primary purpose is to connect to the city. The secondary purpose is to connect every neighborhood in a town together. Every town has bus connection to the city and every neighborhood in a town is connected.</p>
              <p>Although the long-distance bus services may be up to three times slower than the MRT, it does offer a direct connection to the city. For fast connection, one can take the MRT.</p>
              <p>This will over-write all the bus services at Marina Centre Bus Terminal and Shenton Way Bus Terminal. These bus terminals can then be replaced and their land can be used for other purposes.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the spare capacity at the bus interchange at the city after we have around thirty bus services, we can use them to accommodate cross-boarder bus services - operated by Malaysia's own bus companies - to the various residential areas in Johor Bahru.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, we can use the bus interchanges at the residential towns to have bus services that run directly to every bus interchanges in Singapore. Currently, there are around eighteen bus interchanges. In future, there may be around five more, total around twenty three. We can have up to around twenty two such bus services at every bus interchange. These bus services run direct between the bus interchanges and only call at every bus stop in the two residential towns where the two bus interchanges are in.</p>
              <p>A former user by the name "Path Light" used to "recommend" (spam) such bus routes, but for my recommendation, I am going further to recommend that every bus interchange has bus services to every other bus interchanges in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This, along with the direct bus services to the city, can replace almost every basic bus service in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think this will bring about an overall improvement to the bus connectivity in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The only exception is bus services at the industrial estates, changi airport, the zoo and the cemetery area. These areas can have their own bus terminals to have bus services that connect to the nearest MRT stations.</p>

              <p>The new Yishun temp interchange is much smoother than the

              <p>Sembawang Int is bulit to better manage services in the area. This interchange has no feeder services. However, the small amount of services may need to expand fast. BSEP has added 117, 859B and 882A. It has also modified 859A. The upcoming Canberra sub-divison will also need services.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>BSEP is to bring more buses onto the roads to ease human traffic. Naturally this will cause more congestion at bus interchanges/terminals and even on roads and bus stops.

              <p>There are currently 24 bus interchanges (incl. Joo Koon, BPJ, YCK). Suppose if they were all given connections to each other, that'd be (23+22+21+...+1= ) 276 bus services. Then again, most of them cannot even accomodate 23 services, in addition to their local feeders.</p>

              <p>Although our bus routes are matured, I feel that eventually, with new towns opening and major developments, we have to revamp our bus routes, so that we do not have to always have new bus services, while at the same time we can maintain a certain level of bus connectivity.</p>
              <p>Also, like this thread has mentioned, there is not enough space at the bus interchanges and terminals for so many bus services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering if we could have a Larkin Bus Terminal at the city. Larkin Bus Terminal has up to around 87 bus parking lots. It is around 3.65 Hectares. We can build a bus interchange of the same size at Nicoll Highway area by re-routing Republic Avenue to create the 3.65 Hectares of land, since that area is kinda like a wasted space anyway.</p>
              <p>The bus interchange at the city can have bus services that go to every residential town and neighborhoods in Singapore. Singapore has up to around thirty towns (including future towns). We can have around thirty bus services, each runs along the entire city area and connects to every neighborhood in a residential town, running express between the city and the residential town it serves.</p>
              <p>These bus services will then terminate at the interchanges in the residential town they serve, or at a bus interchange/terminal near the residential town. Likewise, this is where the reverse direction starts, and ends at the city.</p>
              <p>The route can be very long (up to 55km), but the travel time can be restricted to a certain duration (up to around 90mins; 1.5hrs), by using bus lanes, major roads, expressways and special traffic lights.</p>
              <p>The primary purpose is to connect to the city. The secondary purpose is to connect every neighborhood in a town together. Every town has bus connection to the city and every neighborhood in a town is connected.</p>
              <p>Although the long-distance bus services may be up to three times slower than the MRT, it does offer a direct connection to the city. For fast connection, one can take the MRT.</p>
              <p>This will over-write all the bus services at Marina Centre Bus Terminal and Shenton Way Bus Terminal. These bus terminals can then be replaced and their land can be used for other purposes.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the spare capacity at the bus interchange at the city after we have around thirty bus services, we can use them to accommodate cross-boarder bus services - operated by Malaysia's own bus companies - to the various residential areas in Johor Bahru.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, we can use the bus interchanges at the residential towns to have bus services that run directly to every bus interchanges in Singapore. Currently, there are around eighteen bus interchanges. In future, there may be around five more, total around twenty three. We can have up to around twenty two such bus services at every bus interchange. These bus services run direct between the bus interchanges and only call at every bus stop in the two residential towns where the two bus interchanges are in.</p>
              <p>A former user by the name "Path Light" used to "recommend" (spam) such bus routes, but for my recommendation, I am going further to recommend that every bus interchange has bus services to every other bus interchanges in Singapore.</p>
              <p>This, along with the direct bus services to the city, can replace almost every basic bus service in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think this will bring about an overall improvement to the bus connectivity in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The only exception is bus services at the industrial estates, changi airport, the zoo and the cemetery area. These areas can have their own bus terminals to have bus services that connect to the nearest MRT stations.</p>

              <p>Lets clear it for once and for all. </p>
              <p>Firstly, how many times does 225 ply the MRT station stops? Clearly there isnt the need to evacuate mass amounts of passengers in a short time, as plying MRT stops mid-route means a need for fast clearance to ensure smooth operations. </p>
              <p>913 has a MUCH higher turnover rate on overall. At Admiralty, people both board AND alight. For 225, people only alight at the int. </p>
              <p>Same goes for 291 and 293. Besides the int, how many times do they come near the MRT? It is unfair to compare this way. 913 has to unload and load way more often than any of these svcs. </p>
              <p>Rather, you should compare with 222, which ofc is a disaster. Frequent bunchings/delays, horrifically slow boarding and alighting at Bedok MRT, and unfilled upper decks. </p>
              <p>So there, 913 should get bendies, not DDs.</p>

              in a short time, as plying MRT stops mid-route means a need for
              fast clearance to ensure smooth operations. </p>
              <p>913 has a MUCH higher turnover rate on overall. At Admiralty,
              people both board AND alight. For 225, people only alight at the
              int. </p>
              <p>Same goes for 291 and 293. Besides the int, how many times do
              they come near the MRT? It is unfair to compare this way. 913 has
              to unload and load way more often than any of these svcs. </p>
              <p>Rather, you should compare with 222, which ofc is a disaster.
              Frequent bunchings/delays, horrifically slow boarding and alighting
              at Bedok MRT, and unfilled upper decks. </p>
              <p>So there, 913 should get bendies, not DDs.</p>

              <p>I support that bendies are preferable for 913 compared to DDs but please don't say 222 has unfilled upper decks. Again, point of reference is when 4 BSEP + PPSS wasn't kicked in for 222. Before that 222 DDs were a savior, each getting 100 pax with full upper deck on both sides of Bedok MRT.</p>
              <p>Now with 4 BSEP buses added, there is OFCOURSE going to be bunching. There are so many instances you see SD --&gt; SD --&gt; DD back to back. It is because LTA has added buses on 222/285/291/293 like no one's business. These services can just operate as full fleet SD also can manage now. </p>

              <p><strong>My view on Woodlands Intra-towns / Feeders</strong></p>
              <p>911 - Bendies/SDs (I am upset at how many rigids have been added. Rigids are not able to tank load at st 81/82/83. This was once full fleet bendy, now only at 50%. Ridiculous!)</p>
              <p>912 - DDs only! (lot of rigids added. As others mentioned it is the only option unlike other services to get to ave 1, ave 5 on both sides. Lots of people travel long distance and upper deck will be well utilized. In fact many take to Woodlands Checkpoint even from ave 5 can just go upper deck)</p>
              <p>913 - Bendies only (irritates me that for such a high volume HDB town area that 913 caters, rigids are also deployed. 913 should have bendies because proximity between HDBs at Circle and Admiralty is very low. So bendies will help tank load)</p>
              <p>900 - DDs can be easily used as it is point to point (rigids cannot tank the load)</p>
              <p>901 - DDs can be easily used as those further away near ave 12 can just go upper deck (rigids cannot tank the load)</p>
              <p>902 - Bendies (can just stuff everyone on lower deck for one stop)</p>
              <p>903 - DDs (this is classic example where DDs will be perfect as the Marsiling HDBs are quite far from MRT and people would love to go upper deck)</p>

              <p>300 - now can have capacity downgrade and fleet of 9 buses (5 bendies, 4 rigids)</p>
              <p>301 - can have fleet add with Keat Hong Close (2 bendies + 4 rigids)</p>
              <p>302 - full fleet bendy only</p>
              <p>307 - rigids doing okay!</p>
              <p>983 though not feeder, should be full fleet DD IMO. </p>

              <p><strong>My views on Yishun feeders/intra towns</strong></p>
              <p>800 - can be majority fleet rigid, some bendies can be kicked out to other services</p>
              <p>803 - rigids doing okay</p>
              <p>804 - can do well with DDs given the HDBs along ave 1 and st 41 are quite far from MRT</p>
              <p>806 - can do well with DDs given the HDBs along ave 6 / st 31 are quite far from MRT</p>
              <p>811 - bendies are better option. So many rigids have been added to compensate for lack of bendies. 811 does Yishun MRT multiple times so bendies would be preferred option</p>
              <p>812 - bendies are better option given most HDBs on its route are close to MRT</p>
              <p>860 - though not feeder, I think bendies is better choice than DD though DDs may not be bas as well. Given 860 is WAB, there may not be enough bendies to give so DDs may have to be unless transferred from 804.</p>
              <p>IMO 804/806 better suited for DDs than 860.</p>

              <p>MRT has replaced buses as the primary mode of transport,
              especially for long distances. Introducing additional cross-island
              bus services to every bus interchange is unnecessary and
              ridiculous, not to mention there will be a lot of duplications
              along main roads, and the minor places in between that will not be
              covered as a result.</p>
              <p>What, in your opinion, would be the difference between a Joo
              Koon - Eunos, Joo Koon - Bedok, Joo Koon - Tampines, and Joo Koon -
              Pasir Ris?</p>
              <p>There are currently 24 bus interchanges (incl. Joo Koon, BPJ,
              YCK). Suppose if they were all given connections to each other,
              that'd be (23+22+21+...+1= ) 276 bus services. Then again, most of
              them cannot even accomodate 23 services, in addition to their local
              feeders.</p>

              <p>Okay, maybe not every bus interchange, because this would lead to wasteful duplications, and there may not be enough capacity.</p>
              <p>But at least every residential planning area.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the missing connections within a residential planning area, feeder bus services or short trunk bus services can fill up the gap.</p>
