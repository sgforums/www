                          <p>I was wondering if we could have a Larkin Bus Terminal at the city. Larkin Bus Terminal has up to around 87 bus parking lots. It is around 3.65 Hectares. We can build a bus interchange of the same size at Nicoll Highway area by re-routing Republic Avenue to create the 3.65 Hectares of land, since that area is kinda like a wasted space anyway.</p>
                          <p>The bus interchange at the city can have bus services that go to every residential town and neighborhoods in Singapore. Singapore has up to around thirty towns (including future towns). We can have around thirty bus services, each runs along the entire city area and connects to every neighborhood in a residential town, running express between the city and the residential town it serves.</p>
                          <p>These bus services will then terminate at the interchanges in the residential town they serve, or at a bus interchange/terminal near the residential town. Likewise, this is where the reverse direction starts, and ends at the city.</p>
                          <p>The route can be very long (up to 55km), but the travel time can be restricted to a certain duration (up to around 90mins; 1.5hrs), by using bus lanes, major roads, expressways and special traffic lights.</p>
                          <p>The primary purpose is to connect to the city. The secondary purpose is to connect every neighborhood in a town together. Every town has bus connection to the city and every neighborhood in a town is connected.</p>
                          <p>Although the long-distance bus services may be up to three times slower than the MRT, it does offer a direct connection to the city. For fast connection, one can take the MRT.</p>
                          <p>This will over-write all the bus services at Marina Centre Bus Terminal and Shenton Way Bus Terminal. These bus terminals can then be replaced and their land can be used for other purposes.</p>
                          <p>Whereas for the spare capacity at the bus interchange at the city after we have around thirty bus services, we can use them to accommodate cross-boarder bus services - operated by Malaysia's own bus companies - to the various residential areas in Johor Bahru.</p>
                                    </div>

                      <p>I forgot to update here yesterday when I wrote about it at the other thread.</p>
                      <p>Update: If we have a bus interchange in the city that is about the size of Larkin Bus Terminal, we can only have around thirty five bus bays, not eighty over. Which means there can only be at most seventeen bus services.</p>
                      <p>Actually, it would be good if there are bus services in the City that go to every sub-zone of every HDB planning areas in Singapore. There are currently 25 HDB planning areas outside the city area. 3 more (Tengah, Bidadari, Tampines North) in near future. Around 5 more in the longer run. It would be good if the city area has capacity for around thirty five bus services to around thirty five HDB planning areas, so that every Singaporean has access to a bus service that goes to the city.</p>
                      <p>As mentioned, there are 25 HDB planning areas. In future, maybe up to around 35. If every HDB planning area has a bus service to every other HDB planning area, this means we need 69 bus services [35 + (35 - 1)].</p>
                      <p>Including the bus services to the city, that's 104 bus services (69 + 35). If every HDB planning area has five feeder bus service each, that's 279 bus services [(35 x 5) + 104].</p>
                      <p>There are around ten industrial areas. If each industrial area has around ten bus services, this means we need around 100 bus services. Meanwhile, Changi Airport and the Mandai Zoo need around ten each. Total for non-residential area is around 120 bus services.</p>
                      <p>Overall, that's 399 bus services (279 + 120). But that's in the future. Still better than now. As of year 2014, there are already 309 bus services (207 SBS + 102 SMRT). After this year, maybe there are around 325... </p>
                      <p>Although 399 is more than 325 now, in the long run, there are less bus services. This would be a more efficient way of running bus services.</p>

              <p>I support that bendies are preferable for 913 compared to DDs
              but please don't say 222 has unfilled upper decks. Again, point of
              reference is when 4 BSEP + PPSS wasn't kicked in for 222. Before
              that 222 DDs were a savior, each getting 100 pax with full upper
              deck on both sides of Bedok MRT.</p>
              <p>Now with 4 BSEP buses added, there is OFCOURSE going to be
              bunching. There are so many instances you see SD --&gt; SD --&gt;
              DD back to back. It is because LTA has added buses on
              222/285/291/293 like no one's business. These services can just
              operate as full fleet SD also can manage now. </p>

              <p>Dream on.</p>
              <p>MRT has replaced buses as the primary mode of transport,
              especially for long distances. Introducing additional cross-island
              bus services to every bus interchange is unnecessary and
              ridiculous, not to mention there will be a lot of duplications
              along main roads, and the minor places in between that will not be
              covered as a result.</p>
              <p>What, in your opinion, would be the difference between a Joo
              Koon - Eunos, Joo Koon - Bedok, Joo Koon - Tampines, and Joo Koon -
              Pasir Ris?</p>
              <p>There are currently 24 bus interchanges (incl. Joo Koon, BPJ,
              YCK). Suppose if they were all given connections to each other,
              that'd be (23+22+21+...+1= ) 276 bus services. Then again, most of
              them cannot even accomodate 23 services, in addition to their local
              feeders.</p>

              <p>What do you then think about making current routes express, so that not too many svcs ply one single road? Eg. Making svcs like 66 and 157 skipping stretches of Bukit Timah Road, while svcs with BKT Rd as primary route stay put.</p>
              <p>This is what KMB in HK is doing now. </p>
              <p>This firstly optimises use of bus resources, secondly offers choices for commuters (complete reliance on rail can be disastrous unless you have a mature, developed rail network like Tokyo), and last but not least wont affect much as there is transfer schemes and thr aforementioned svcs dont receive much pax along BKT Rd anyways.</p>

              <p>Resources are not limitless. Put where required. BSEP is excellent but don't over-do things in places where not required. Sometimes, it is just to get your statistics up and "show" that you are doing a lot. If excess resources are there for LTA, I rather they use them to create more bus infrastructure and better facilities within buses.</p>

              <p>Before yr 2010, flats are blooming and buses are getting more
                  and more crowded. People complain and the authorities take action.
                  Initially, 40 new routes will be introduced and 400-500 new buses
                  will be brought in as part of the new BSEP plans. Many other
                  services are all enhanced. Seeing all the good benefits and
                  positive response among residents, they extended to 80 new routes
                  and will beef up the new buses to 1000. Most of the 80 new routes
                  will benefit new towns such as sengkang, Punggol, yishun and
                  CCK. </p>
              <p>In yr 2015, now that most of the buses are much less crowded
                  than before, many people are very happy that they do not have to
                  squeeze like before. They can also avoid the crowded MRT trains
                  during peak hours for those who are possible to travel to work by
                  bus alone. But now comes another problem. People complain again
                  some buses have more spaces and some can be converted to SD, etc.
                  Is the BSEP scheme a victim of its own success or is it people
                  living in singapore really love to complain?</p>

              <p>Resources are not limitless. Put where required. BSEP is
              excellent but don't over-do things in places where not required.
              Sometimes, it is just to get your statistics up and "show" that you
              are doing a lot. If excess resources are there for LTA, I rather
              they use them to create more bus infrastructure and better
              facilities within buses.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Busanalyser, no need worry for them. They will have planned for all the bus infrastructures and resources before implementation. That is why it takes years, not months. As we all should know by now, the answer is people in singapore love to complain and it is easy to complain as well. Moreover, they cannot satisfy everybody. Some sectors will be happy and some will not. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p><br>I wonder why the plans for bus infrastructure come so late...</p>
              <p>Tampines Int extension should have been implemented or at least considered when 4/20 were introduced, not only in Q2 2016. Same for CCK and Punggol where A LOT of services are being introduced.</p>
