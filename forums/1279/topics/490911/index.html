              <p>The full title was initially intended to be "Has BSEP resulted in more congested bus interchanges/terminals?", but due to word limit for thread titles, we'll just stick with infrastructure.</p>
              <p>I feel that this issue does deserve a thread of its own given its great disparity compared to other issues related to BSEP such as its overall benefits and disadvantages to bus service standards.</p>
              <p>Since 2012, the BSEP has saw the introduction of more than 50 new/amended bus services around Singapore to enhance connectivity between residential estates, industrial estates, the CBD and MRT/LRT stations.</p>
              <p>However, the addition of more bus services may also have resulted in greater congestion in existing bus interchanges/terminals. While interchange expansions have been announced for Punggol, Sengkang &amp; Tampines and other bus interchanges/facilities are only used temporarily: to be replaced by possibly larger or unfortunately smaller-sized bus interchange/terminal facilities.</p>
              <p>Excluding the addition of BSEP buses to existing non-BSEP services, the BSEP saw the addition of the following list of bus services to the following bus interchanges/terminals:</p>

              <p>Certain interchange i wander they manage to fit the bus services like 120,121,122 at NBR. SBW got a lot of space so no worries. WRI cant fit anymore buses already. 904 is enough. CCK gonna explode already like Tampines. Bishan also.</p>
              <p>But i kept wondering if they keep adding buses on already congested interchange, wouldnt it be inconvenient for the BC to rush time and then have to wait behind HC buses like bendies and DDs and especially peak hour where buses have to wait at most 5 mins just to get to their berth or their rest time or meal time.</p>

              <p>35 and 35M operate at different timings, therefore overall it is still considered one service at any point of time and did not add on to the total services operating before the extension.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Boon Lay Interchange overall has two fewer bus services as 182/182M, 254, 255 and 257 were taken out as well.</span></p>
              <p>As for Bukit Panjang, I agree there is more confusion and congestion, but due to DTL2, the bus services may be spreaded out among the bus stops built, though whether the confusion issue will be settled still remains to be seen in 2016.</p>
              <p>Changi Business Park can still hold two more services, though it occurs to me that BSEP mostly operate services to new areas; this is what I suppose SBS Transit may have also intended to do.</p>

              <p>I would agree overall BSEP has led to more congestion at certain interchanges.</p>
              <p>Apart from what you have listed, they have randomly added many buses to certain services that were doing fine just to please MP or crowds to show improvement.</p>
              <p>Classic example is 222/285/291/293 that all received PPSS + got many fleet add. Through lot of observations, most of this seems unecessary causing severe bunching, empty buses and wasted resources.</p>
              <p>I support introduction of new services, though some have been poorly planned, while the recent lot is quite decent (think LTA has some what learned from its mistakes).Â </p>

              <p>Sorry, but, no.</p>
                           <p>Our Singapore Government already know that there would not be enough capacity at the bus interchanges, terminals and depots to accomodate every new bus service and the net increase in number of buses. That is why they have constructed new bus depots (and bus parks), and are constructing more. That is why they have constructed Changi Business Park Bus Terminal, and are constructing more. That is why they are constructing extensions at some bus interchanges and terminals in the East, and I belive they will upgrade the capacity of bus interchanges and terminals in the West in tandem with developments as currently there is no need.</p>
                          <p>In other words, your argument is not valid.</p>

              <p>Well IMO, the only congested interchange i feel is Boon Lay, so many bus svcs but parking lot wise also very bad. You look at the End on berths, during peak hour 198 can come in 5 buses at once and no place to even alight the passengers (dont mention parking for breaks) then some 198 still need change to 198A and still is all about waiting for its turn to go in and park for a good 5 to 10 mins before it departs. Every svc only got 2 lots def no space.</p>
              <p>As for the boarding side, parking also limited. Peak hour come, 3 or 4 buses doing alighting the rest all queue outside until the library there.Â </p>

              <p>Punggol is now a mayhem... It now handles triple the amount of buses as compared to 2011</p>
              <p>This is adding on to non-BSEP svcs, i.e. svc 82 and 84.Â </p>
              <p>I really hope Punggol will get a new ITH.Â </p>
              <p>Isnt Buangkok under planning/construction? If so I recommend several services eg. 118 to divert there to free up space for Punggol.</p>

              <p>Some of the bus interchanges are already in a big mess. This was even before the implementation of BSEP.</p>
              <p>Woodlands Regional Interchange, the only underground bus interchange, has seen plenty of bendies and rigids trying to clear the load of pax heading to Republic Poly. Service 902 maintains at least 3 O405G Hispano Habits along with 4 A22s. Service 966 used to be spammed with a number of rigids initially, but has since changed from full fleet A22s into a mix of E500s and A22s.</p>
              <p>Another bus interchange, Yishun Bus Interchange has its share of problems. The berth closest to Northpoint Shopping Centre had been allocated to Service 800, 804 and later 804A (now 806). Service 804 in particular, has a very heavy loading near North View Secondary. Service 804A was introduced to counter that. Service 804 had also been upgraded into full fleet bendies. Service 806 has went the same way, full fleet bendies as well. In view of the heavy loading on 804 and 806, 800 was moved to another berth sharing with service 856 and 859. Being one of oldest interchanges, Yishun Bus Interchange was not equipped to handle massive buses. Moreover, 800, 804, 806, 856 and 859 had bendies deployed with 3 services having full fleet bendies. 859 was reduced to full fleet rigids.</p>

              <p>There is really a much easier way to settle this for Yishun - just <span style="color: #ff9900;">direct some of the load to Khatib MRT</span>, so commuters who just want to transfer between MRT and buses to home / work can do so at Khatib.

              <p>The new Yishun temp interchange is much smoother than the original one. Even though the number of services has increased + frequency of buses, it doesn't seem a huge mess. One of the reasons is many of the bendies have been replaced with rigids and sv 856/857 have got DDs. So fewer bendies, fewer problems.</p>
              <p>WRI also major issue is because of bendies.</p>
