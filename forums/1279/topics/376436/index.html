              <p>Technically, the correct phrase to use is "limiting the number of bendy buses" and not "banning of bendy buses". New bendy buses can still be brought in if SMRT Buses were to de-reg their old bendy buses.</p>

              <p>It is really a limit and not a ban. All the while, the number of bendy buses in singapore is about 313. SMRT can bring in new bendy buses to replace de-reg bendy buses, which we won't be seeing soon as this won't happen until 14 July 2014 when the bulk of MB0405G start to reach 17 years of age (TIB0838H expring on 13/03/2013).</p>

              <p>Not to agree or disagree but I certainly disagree why SMRTB don't want to buy double deckers instead, if the ban for bendy buses is valid. There is no law in Singapore to state that SBST is the only public bus company that is entitled to buy and use double decker buses only. And the stupid mindset of both companies not trying to get into the boundaries of even getting the type of buses to use. Like if SBST use double deckers, then other companies cannot use it, and TIBS brought in bendy buses, SBST can't really entitled to use these type of buses in the end (sad fate for SBS998Y and SBS999U).</p>
              <p>Both companies are providing bus services to commuters, and providing the best way for smooth operations and most comfortable buses to them is the higher priority, not engaging to some senseless wars that deprive the use of specific buses for the comfort of commuters. This is called stupidity and childish in mindset in the so called first class public transport companies.</p>
              <p>Look at Hong Kong, does KMB and Citybus are so completely against each other that one company cannot use double deckers/midibuses/regular buses??? No. They uses the same type of buses mostly, be it a double decker or single decker or midibuses. Moreover they can use the same brands, same models, i.e. Both KMB and Citybus uses Volvo B9TLs, Volvo Olympians, Dennis Tridents, Alexander Dennis Enviro 500, etc.</p>
              <p>Unlike Hong Kong, our local companies not only takes the pie of the bus manufacturer and also the type of buses they should use. This is real dumb. If SMRT can bring in double deckers, half of their overloading problems is solved. Even if there is no such ban on bendy buses, I believe SMRT won't be bringing in more bendies, because space constraints for all depots and temporary night parkings.</p>
              <p>Let's talk about the ban in effect. SMRT can still buy double deckers for their operations if bendies are banned. Building depots of higher heights in future will cater for the needs for double deckers to be parked in depots. And depots of multistories may likely be the future as I believe URA may/may not limit the land use of bus depots in land scarce Singapore.</p>
              <p>Next, I believe LTA bans bendies in Singapore for the following reasons:</p>
              <p>- longer bus queues along bus stops, especially those busier ones. This might cause other buses behind to wait even longer to load and unload their passengers.</p>
              <p>- longer bus queues form in bus interchanges/terminals, this problem gets very bad in Yishun interchange,  and WRI at some berths.</p>
              <p>- longer parking spaces, which means more limited space in depots/interchanges may be taken up for these lots. (2 bendy lots can park 3 single and double decker buses with a little more allowances.)</p>
              <p>I believe LTA has this kind of negative mindset that long bus queues along Singapore roads and bus stops are no good, which I think is bad. Other reasons I believe:</p>
              <p>- longer vehicles tends to take up more space on the roads, thus bus companies may have to pay more ERP charges for the larger area of space they have to take up on the road (Not sure about this). (Btw, paying ERP for public transport, buses and taxis is another dumb idea from LTA). However this is more of the bus operator issue.</p>
              <p>- These longer buses tends to block certain slip roads' pedestrian crossings, yellow boxes which may not be in favor of LTA's mentality of more free flowing roads for other motorists and pedestrians.</p>
              <p>- Not cost effective (e.g. ERP) for operators, if the bus is empty during operation, and certainly cause more unwanted delays for other buses behind and takes up more road space.</p>
              <p>- Complaints about the back trailers that tends to swing dangerously, especially on wet roads.</p>
              <p>- Fire incidents on bendy buses, since they mostly have to work extra hard in order to hurl the longer trailer and more passengers since bendy buses uses the same engines as single deckers.</p>
              <p>Generally Singapore roads are considered narrow and bus stops and bus bays are generally short and small and thus not really that suitable for bendy buses. Judging by the road conditions here and in Hong Kong (and also looking into population and road density in both cities), both are similar in many aspects, thus that's why I believe why Hong Kong operators uses majority DD fleet instead for so many decades.</p>
              <p>That's why I feel that since bendies are banned or limited, then SMRT should go for double deckers instead and throw away that stupid mindset. In this way, they can solve the problem of parking spaces in depots and at the same time, needless to say to solve the problem of driver shortages. </p>
              <p>This shows another inflexibility in our public transport system, when compared to other countries like Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Singapore First Class Public Transport System = failure.</p>

              <p>I agree too. From the way LTA wants to restructure the local bus system, and they are more in favour towards an inflexible rail system as backbone in future, the future of better bus services and networks seems bleak. Especially for people like me who only likes to take buses only.</p>

              <p>Not really. Remember the Citaro G test? Lols. Unlike articulated semi-trucks, bendy buses have side hydraulic cylinders that prevent such yawing motion. The cylinders will move in relation with the steering wheel. Once the steering wheel stops moving so will the cylinders, therefore "locking" them. Its a hydraulic valve lock mechanism.</p>
              <p>As for engine fires, they are caused by fuel leakage. The batch 1 Habits and below generation of bendies, some have manufacturing and assembly defect in their engine fuel system. The fuel pump and fuel delivery system(in this case, its using low pressure normal fuel injectors via a small hose) did not match up. Fuel leaked from the gaps. Once the fuel reaches the hot exhaust pipes its turned into vapour quickly, but fails to ignite as diesel fumes and the fuel itself is hard to ignite. Some source is needed to start the fire.</p>
              <p><br>I myself personally would be glad to take a bendy bus than a double deck bus. Main thing is i cant sit on most seat on the top deck of a double deck bus as im susceptible to motion sickness, hence i tend to sit on the lower deck.</p>

              <p>Singapore has only started to face the situation that Londoners (as well as their bus fans) faced 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>Londoners hated the bendy buses. As they replaced the ironic Routemasters, many find themselves having to stand rather than a seat. (It's just like from our Merc O405 to KUB) Furthermore, there is no additional beneift from the Bendy's extra door they can board rather than the open-rear platform of the Routemaster. And then there's the fires.That's why the current mayor can't wait to get rid of them.</p>
              <p>Singapore's story with its bendy buses has one major difference. Bendy buses were introduced as an additional capacity to rigid buses rather than as a form of substitution. Back then, they were considered more modern than other buses and (then) TIBS generally had the goodwill of the public.</p>
              <p>An awful lot of buses were forced off London and replaced by WABs to comply with the accessibility requirement. It is not surprising for me to hear about comments on the KUB now because the DD WABs were described by bus fans in London to be "rattling plastic trash". Eventually, people got used to it, but they just simply tolerated it until they get the chance to voice it (which was the city elections. Singapore doesn't have this option though).</p>
              <p>BTW If SMRT bring in double-deckers, I'm pretty sure some of you are going to scream. Volvo deals with SBS Transit exclusively, there are only Mercedes artics. What do we have next? From what turned out to be in the London bus scenes, these are the few possible options  :</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Scania KUB or VDL (aka DAF) double-deckers, probably locally-bodied (i.e. Gemilang/SC) OR</li>
              <li>Alexander Dennis Enviro 500 completely-built OR</li>
              <li>Perhaps new Chinese-built double-deckers models<br></li>

              In fact, your leader wants you to take rail instead of bus, so you cannot dream of better bus services than trains. You cannot dream of a headrest on long distance bus trips.
                  
                  Private operators for express routes offer less comfortable service. The majority of buses could be truck chassis with local bodies. If they have big fleets coaches with air suspension and inclinable seats, the two companies may improve their service a little bit.
                  
                  The two big companies dominated the market, but they do not have big competition at all. They are just sharing the pie. Overloading trips, they pay fine. ERP, they pay fee. Where does the fee come? Your wallet. They have put these in their "operating costs". Think whether they are reasonable.
                  
                  Ordinary passengers like to take a bus over a train mainly because they would like to get themselves seated. How many seats do N113, O 405 and B10M have. How many seats do K230 or OC500LE offer? The total capacity is the same, but the no. of seats is only 60% of original.
                  
                  Even for the same model, the two companies buy buses with different bodies. This is for you to distinguish the company and also make you hard to compare level of comfort through same model of buses in different companies.
                  
                  I would suggest bendies should be banned on very busy roads like Shenton Way / Robinson Road. But for most other roads, I don't see a problem at all.
                  
                  Double deckers takes up less space on road, but bendies have better boarding / alighting time.
                  
                  Material improvement in service is next to hopeless unless competitions, less circuituous routes, more areas with coverage by both companies and different farescales can be adopted. However, it is oligopoly.
                  
                  But competitions as keen as Hong Kong / London may not be as good as you think of.
              
              No articulated buses in Hong Kong is because the length limit of such buses is just 15 metres by law, i.e. it is controlled by government. Singapore roads are wide enough for bendys, as many European cities with bendys do not have roads as wide as Singapore.
              
              If you are rich, drive. If you are not rich enough, you can only rely on public transport.
