              <p>Bendies are more suited for feeder routes. I once asked a route manager for 238 why no DD is deployed on this popular service. His reply was that the route is so short, the passengers wouldnt want to climb up and down when they are just alighting after a few stops.</p>
              <p>I can think of some other benefits of bendies. Older ppple and some ladies may not like to climb the stairs for DD, so a bendy is more suitable.

              <p>But those stupid anti-SMRT brats will come and give you the same story that bendies take up more space, and cause delays in unloading, which IMO is rubbish. If we assume 1 bendy equivalent to 2 DDs, the fact is that a full bendy can unload more passengers, close doors and move off faster than twice the time it takes for 2 full DDs to unload passengers. </p>

              more suitable. With an additional rear door, the unloading rate can
              be faster than a DD. DD got height limit restriction.My friend
              wrote to sbst to ask them to convert 16 to DD but was given the
              answer was due to the ht limit near the stadium. Bendies can
              actually turn sharper corners than SD as their turning radius is
              smaller.</p>
              <p>Hope bendies can stay around longer, they are quite unique and
              special modes of transport in SG. But please, change the seats, too
              prickly and smeelly sometimes.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, bendy did really empty faster due to 2 rear doors, but you must consider the space they took, if one bendy take up same space as 2 DD, bendy cannot empty as fast to allow 2 bendy to empty while 2 DDs can empty simultaneously.</p>
              <p>I agree with the 238 issue, short routes, pple lazy to climb up, at times 222 DD 2nd Deck is totally near empty, dunnoe why sbst want 222 to run AP for ADD, run E/S slove problem. For 225, it is also the same case, 225 G add slot is AP, should convert to 225 W E slot.</p>
              <p>FYI, service 16 just need more downroute at city area, otherwise other parts SD can adequately cover, the DD restriction is for medava bridge (3.3 m to 4.4m of DD)</p>
              <p>Seats should not change for bendy, SPH mah </p>
