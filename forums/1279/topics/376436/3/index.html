              <p>It is not asking to SMRT to scrap their bendies overnight, but do a progressive replacement as and when the bendies reach their statutory lifespans, which means as and when the bendies are scrapped, buy new double deckers.</p>
              <p>Since now LTA is supportive for the building of new infrastruture for new depots, SMRT can request for the progressive upgrading for their existing depots to be double decker friendly. For example, since the lease for Ang Mo Kio depot is up soon, and they are building a new one, then the new one can be double decker friendly. Just like what SBST is going to for Bedok North, if the rumor is true, they want to upgrade the depot as a multistorey one. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Banning bendies is a bad idea, even limiting them is as good as banning them. Instead of jeopardising the number of high capacity buses for SMRTB, then might as well go easy with double deckers instead. But then it all depends whether SMRT really bother interested to do all these or not. If it was the old TIBS, banning bendies will never happen to them.</p>

              great.</p>
              <p>It would be better for SMRT to take over all rail and
              SBST take over all bus services in Singapore. They can fully
              utilise their specialities and make full use of it to do greater
              improvements.</p>
              <p>It is not asking to SMRT to scrap their bendies overnight, but
              do a progressive replacement as and when the bendies reach their
              statutory lifespans, which means as and when the bendies are
              scrapped, buy new double deckers.</p>
              <p>Since now LTA is supportive for the building of new
              infrastruture for new depots, SMRT can request for the progressive
              upgrading for their existing depots to be double decker friendly.
              For example, since the lease for Ang Mo Kio depot is up soon,
              and they are building a new one, then the new one can be double
              decker friendly. Just like what SBST is going to for Bedok North,
              if the rumor is true, they want to upgrade the depot as a
              multistorey one. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Banning bendies is a bad idea, even limiting them is as good as
              banning them. Instead of jeopardising the number of high capacity

              <p><br>I never supported the central planning in the first place. Even before the central planning takes place, LTA is already interfering too much in the bus operations for the local bus operators. Take this bendy bus episode for example.</p>
              <p>However, the most destructing rules they implement is the boundaries limitation for bus operators (hence poor bus network links to the North and Northwest), ERP for buses and taxis, eliminating bus routes along MRT lines, etc.</p>
              <p>All these are simply unnecessary rules which controls the operations of bus operators too much and thus limiting the best offerings that bus services can give to commuters in a small city like Singapore. Such kind of restrictions should be changed according to the bus operators perspective and not LTA interference into such operations matters.</p>
              <p>What LTA should control is more of the commuters' perspective, like frequency of bus services, safety and cleaniness of buses, the concentration of bus routes and networks to compete with other forms of public transport, fares and quality of customer service.</p>
              <p>With the central planning coming up, I would say to many of you here, maybe prepare for the worse.</p>

              <p>Bendy buses are ok for urban operations and training is provided for bendy bus drivers. Given their load capacity and the 1 entrance 2 exit concept for a faster passenger flow on the same level, bannning bendy buses would be a pity.</p>

              <p><br>Mostly, RP people around 7.45am to 10am and 3.30pm to 5pm. They can choose to take 903 at either last stop of Riverside Road or walk to Block 803 bus-stop after school time.</p>
              <p>This is what happen after school: Because of fully packed at RIverside Road stop, some of them cannot really squeeze in at the last stop before going WRI. Furthermore, most of them also boarded 169 from opp. RP stop.</p>
              <p>But they keep frequency of 903 on 10 to 12 minutes. Most of the times, I had to wait 903 for about more than 10 minutes. After that, both 903 buses were bunched up together to fetch RP people.</p>
