              <p>I doubt PTC/LTA will allow route changes if they take over. But I can be sure the runtime of the services SBST takes over will increase by <strong>at least</strong> 150%. For example, 1h 30 minutes for half a trip (Yishun -&gt; BMR) on 851 will increase to slightly over 2 hours.</p>

              <p>I think that is what they are planning to do. Since more MRT lines coming up, less need for more bus services, so less or even no need for more high capacity buses. Just all rigid buses will do. </p>

              <p>When the Circle line is fully up in future, SMRT will be very eager to withdraw all these direct bus services, since they will be eating into the riderships and profits of their rail business. And that is what I am most worried, even lesser bus routes along Northwest in future. NEL is an example.</p>
              <p>Although direct, look at the way they manage the service 966, frequencies sucks, and don't even really want to deploy bendy buses because of their lousy frequencies and cause overcrowding. Look at airport services, 858 has the worst frequecies, followed by 34. Look at 851, during peak hours, a few trips on the evenings, even before Thomson Medical Center, you can already see a few people can't even board the bus. Last time when there were bendies, there isn't such happenings. And it's TIBS who introduce these services, not SMRT. There is less than 5 services being introduced since SMRT took over TIBS. No improvements, pathetic.</p>
              <p>SBST also have lots of direct routes, but it's more of between point to point, not end to end. SBST and TIBS have to introduce all these cross border services because of the stupid LTA territory rulings.</p>
              <p>So it'll better for SBST to operate all bus and SMRT all rail. Enough of SMRT medicore services.</p>

              <p>That's why we have only one 14.5 meter bus here, because drivers find it very hard to manoeuvre in and out of bus bays, tight corners, etc. Luckily they didn't sell it away after a year trial that time.</p>

              <p>I'd suggest that you stand at TMC again and look at 851. It's better nowadays. And besides, most of the unable to board situations are because of people refusing to move to the rear - that can't be helped - this happens whether it's an OC or not.</p>
              <p>Since you took the bendy deployment as a solution to this problem, let me just state this: I was on a bendy today on 851, the front was packed and almost nobody could board - but I was enjoying the comfort at the rear with the amount of space near and around me. Happens almost on a daily basis I would say. In fact, right behind the bendy came an OC 3 minutes later, fully seated and hardly with any standees.</p>
              <p>How would <em>you</em> know that they don't want to deploy bendies on 966 or any other bus service? There might be a constrain that we don't know of and they wouldn't let people know. <em>Note that I did not talk about frequency here. </em>On an unrelated food for thought note: Have you thought that bendies are needed more on <em>feeder services</em> rather than trunk services since they're what that brings people home (and an undeniable fact is that most people do travel by train to a bus interchange and change to a feeder)? Certainly, if the bendies are deployed on feeders, they can't be deployed on trunks. One stands to lose and one stands to gain, as in every other situation. I'm pretty sure the number of people taking feeders outnumbers trunks easily.</p>
              <p>On withdrawing services: If SBST ran the Circle Line fully, or the line that runs in the North West coming up soon (Bukit Timah Line iirc), there's a good chance that bus services will be withdrawn or rerouted too. It's not a case of whichever company wants to and are eager to withdraw it now. It's almost inevitable that the train will become the main mode of transport with buses serving as feeder services to train stations.</p>
              <p>On introducing new services to "improve" their services: There isn't a need to introduce services for the sake of introducing, they should only be introduced when needed. Are there any services that they <em>need</em> to introduce? What's the point of spending the money to prepare for the introduction of a new service, only to reroute, and possibly withdraw it a few months later because of lack of ridership?</p>
              <p>Besides, it seems that the focus of the transport companies has changed to managing the increasing ridership due to the increase in population instead of attempting to raise ridership as in the past. It doesn't make sense for them to add services when they're trying to manage it. More bus services = lesser spare buses for them to use and deploy.</p>
              <p>Comparing end to end and point to point services is like comparing apples to oranges. They both serve different purposes and its barely fair to compare them.</p>
              <p>Don't flame for the sake of flaming them. Almost all your posts between the two companies have <em>been on the lines</em> of flaming SMRT's Bus Services.</p>
              <p>I hope you don't take this as an inflammatory post, however if you wish to, there's nothing I can do :).</p>

              <p>If they had bothered to do their improvements, then why would people want to complain??? I'm not the only one complaining, even people I know are unhappy about their services. Some are even tired of complaining, they give up and use their own transport instead.</p>
              <p>I had boarded on an OC on 851 before, it was packed to the brim (to the end, the front area before the raised mid aisle was so packed that you see 3 lines of people at the aisle between the 2 front wheels) when I boarded on Novena. Those after that couldn't possibly had boarded it, for some trips at the evening peak. My friend working at MCYS everyday simply gave up on 851. He rather take a bus to Novena to take MRT. He asked me why 851 has lesser bendy buses recently and more rigids.</p>
              <p>The service frequency did improve, the run time also extended as the buses on 851 runs slower nowdays, but the loadings in fact becomes worse at some point of time during evening peak. You are lucky, you can board the bus, if not, wait for the next. 851 is just one of the minority services to get such better improvements, but even for the 10 mins intervals, the OCs can't cope sometimes.</p>
              <p>I agree that it is the passengers' fault who do not want to cooperate. But on SMRT side, the frequencies on a lot of services are bad just because they want to squeeze as many people on board. So this is a way to attract people to take buses???</p>
              <p>The links of North and Northwest are already poor enough. That time was under TIBS, fair enough, they are building up, they have limited resources. However since taken over, SMRT should at least introduce a few more services to link to other parts of Singapore . Did they??? No. People feedbacked on the press before a few years back that the North (especially Sembawang), Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok, etc needs more direct bus services to Southwest and Southeast, but do they even bother??? Yes, thinking of withdrawing 178 and 852 instead. Route planners don't plan bus routes for nothing or based on nothing. Planning a new AND feasible route and have it on trial at least could, tell commuters that their concerns are addressed, instead of just sitiing there doing nothing, which, is as good as telling them that the company is not interested at all. TIBS introduction of 700 and 857 are the best examples and many of the new SBST routes in the 2000s are also useful.</p>
              <p>If they are really not interested in improving the bus services at the expense of their rail business, then please, please give the bus operations to SBST or another better bus operator. If they do not have enough buses, fair enough, give a few areas to another bus company to operate and concentrate on those they have. Don't keep on hogging the areas and give this kind of nonsense to the public. Want to go for rail, then fully concentrate on that area. Don't sacrifice bus operations just because it is eating into the core business, there are better operators out there, even overseas that can provide a better bus service.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, one operator for bus and another for rail. Bus and rail compete and complement to provide better services to commuters. And don't tell me those nonsense on more than one bus operator will enhance competition because apparently here, all the bus operations are controlled by LTA, not a free market by the companies themselves (while LTA should control on the aspects that should be controlled). Competition in this market is virtually inexistant here.</p>
              <p>I already said earlier too, since bendy bus is banned, then get double deckers. SBST is not the only bus company here that can operate double deckers. So I don't think this is flaming SMRT all the time.</p>
              <p>I shall stop here, because if this discussion continues, it will just go on and on and never stop. And no point engaging in another flame war again, as I'm not interested in engaging in those kind of bickerings as shown in the photography thread here in this bus section.</p>

              <p>Every evening after Thomson Rd 851 buses always bunch. It's not because their frequencies suck but rather because the departure headway from Bukit Merah is short, but yet high loading still occurs and the first bus of the pack keeps getting delayed while those behind get to move faster. So they bunch! It's not unusual to see 3-4 buses arriving Yishun at the same time.</p>
              <p>Peak frequencies for 851 = 7-8 mins. And note: bendies are out in full force during peak hours.</p>

              <p>I actually think its Bugis which causes them to bunch up too...the traffic light and junction there simply takes too much time.</p>

                                                          companies themselves (while LTA should control on the aspects that
                                                          should be controlled). Competition in this market is virtually
                                                          inexistant here.</p>
              <p>I already said earlier too, since bendy bus is banned, then get
                                                          double deckers. SBST is not the only bus company here that can
                                                          operate double deckers. So I don't think this is flaming SMRT all
                                                          the time.</p>

              <p><br> I fully agree. Had enough of their nonsense. If it happens,
                  great.</p>
              <p>It would be better for SMRT to take over all rail and
                  SBST take over all bus services in Singapore. They can fully
                  utilise their specialities and make full use of it to do greater
                  improvements.</p>
              <p>It is not asking to SMRT to scrap their bendies overnight, but
                  do a progressive replacement as and when the bendies reach their
                  statutory lifespans, which means as and when the bendies are
                  scrapped, buy new double deckers.</p>
              <p>Since now LTA is supportive for the building of new
                  infrastruture for new depots, SMRT can request for the progressive
                  upgrading for their existing depots to be double decker friendly.
                  For example, since the lease for Ang Mo Kio depot is up soon,
                  and they are building a new one, then the new one can be double
                  decker friendly. Just like what SBST is going to for Bedok North,
                  if the rumor is true, they want to upgrade the depot as a
                  multistorey one. Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
              <p>Banning bendies is a bad idea, even limiting them is as good as
                  banning them. Instead of jeopardising the number of high capacity
                  buses for SMRTB, then might as well go easy with double deckers
                  instead. But then it all depends whether SMRT really bother
                  interested to do all these or not. If it was the old TIBS, banning
                  bendies will never happen to them.</p>
              <p>For those who don't believe in jack knifing or back trailer
                  swinging, here's a video.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np26f6ofw0k&amp;amp;feature=PlayList&amp;amp;p=ED3EE127A09AC391&amp;amp;index=8&amp;amp;playnext=2&amp;amp;playnext_from=PL">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np26f6ofw0k&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=ED3EE127A09AC391&amp;index=8&amp;playnext=2&amp;playnext_from=PL</a></p>
              <p>However for Singapore bendy buses, the middle turntable are
                  electronically controlled and equipped with safety switches to
                  prevent jacknifing, so basically this will not happen
                  here. But such mechanisms MAY not always be working properly
                  if say, poor maintainance over time, detoriation of the mechanisms
                  due to long service years and old age. Our bendy buses do not swing
                  or jack knife at the extremes shown at the video, but that doesn't
                  mean there is no minimal effects. It might not be felt when in the
                  bus, but may be visible while you are outside the bus.
                  Sometimes tires also play a part, especially a worn out tire
                  on  wet slippery roads.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>All the problems that are incurred here are due to LTA and their ambigious policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is like letting you walk two steps, and then pulling you back one.</p>
              <p>Just a question, how did you know that SMRT's AMKDepot's lease is running up?<br>And for sure if BNDep is going to become a multi-storey bus park ala Soon Lee, works would have started sooner, not later. I don't think BN would go multi-storey, the mess caused by construction and the need to relocate parking for the already crowded BN is going to be a big headache.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure if SMRT didn't(and hasn't till now) bought DDs, they have good reason for that.</p>

              <p>If they had bothered to do their improvements, then why would
              people want to complain??? I'm not the only one complaining, even
              people I know are unhappy about their services. Some are even tired
              of complaining, they give up and use their own transport
              instead.</p>
              <p>I had boarded on an OC on 851 before, it was packed to the
              brim (to the end, the front area before the raised mid aisle
              was so packed that you see 3 lines of people at the aisle
              between the 2 front wheels) when I boarded on Novena. Those after
              that couldn't possibly had boarded it, for some trips at the
              evening peak. My friend working at MCYS everyday simply gave
              up on 851. He rather take a bus to Novena to take MRT. He asked me
              why 851 has lesser bendy buses recently and more rigids.</p>
              <p>The service frequency did improve, the run time also extended as
              the buses on 851 runs slower nowdays, but the loadings in fact
              becomes worse at some point of time during evening peak. You are
              lucky, you can board the bus, if not, wait for the next. 851 is
              just one of the minority services to get such better
              improvements, but even for the 10 mins intervals, the OCs can't
              cope sometimes.</p>
              <p>I agree that it is the passengers' fault who do not want to
              cooperate. But on SMRT side, the frequencies on a lot of services
              are bad just because they want to squeeze as many people on board.
              So this is a way to attract people to take buses???</p>
              <p>The links of North and Northwest are already poor enough. That
              time was under TIBS, fair enough, they are building up, they have
              limited resources. However since taken over, SMRT should at least
              introduce a few more services to link to other parts of
              Singapore . Did they??? No. People feedbacked on the press
              before a few years back that the North (especially Sembawang),
              Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok, etc needs more direct bus services
              to Southwest and Southeast, but do they even bother??? Yes,
              thinking of withdrawing 178 and 852 instead. Route planners don't
              plan bus routes for nothing or based on nothing. Planning a new AND
              feasible route and have it on trial at least could, tell commuters
              that their concerns are addressed, instead of just sitiing there
              doing nothing, which, is as good as telling them that the company
              is not interested at all. TIBS introduction of 700 and 857 are the
              best examples and many of the new SBST routes in the 2000s are also
              useful.</p>
              <p>If they are really not interested in improving the bus services
              at the expense of their rail business, then please,
              please give the bus operations to SBST or another better bus
              operator. If they do not have enough buses, fair enough,
              give a few areas to another bus company to operate and
              concentrate on those they have. Don't keep on hogging the areas and
              give this kind of nonsense to the public. Want to go for rail, then
              fully concentrate on that area. Don't sacrifice bus operations just
              because it is eating into the core business, there are better
              operators out there, even overseas that can provide a better bus
              service.</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, one operator for bus and another for rail.
              Bus and rail compete and complement to provide better services to
              commuters. And don't tell me those nonsense on more than one bus
              operator will enhance competition because apparently here, all the
              bus operations are controlled by LTA, not a free market by the
              companies themselves (while LTA should control on the aspects that
              should be controlled). Competition in this market is virtually
              inexistant here.</p>
              <p>I already said earlier too, since bendy bus is banned, then get
              double deckers. SBST is not the only bus company here that can
              operate double deckers. So I don't think this is flaming SMRT all
              the time.</p>
              <p>I shall stop here, because if this discussion continues, it will
              just go on and on and never stop. And no point engaging in another
              flame war again, as I'm not interested in engaging in those kind of
              bickerings as shown in the photography thread here in this
              bus section.</p>

              <p>Sometimes we shouldn't just blame SMRT or SBS Transit. There were good bus routes proposed but all were killed by PTC, just like the recent proposed service 858 amendment to ply Sembawang.</p>

              <p>Here's my take on SMRTB....please clean up the buses! SBST buses of comparable age don't stink as much and are less dusty!</p>
