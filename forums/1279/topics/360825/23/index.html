              <p>The stomper want to speed and kill himself on the road is his
              own problem. Dont say buses block his way to hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, buses should have the right of way since it's a
              PUBLIC TRANSPORT and it carries MORE PEOPLE compared to CARS. Only
              emergency vehicles have more priority than buses. The transport
              minister said before that buses shd be given right of way since
              more pple are travelling in it, therefore benefitting more
              Singaporeans. Saying things like buses block their way is just
              selfish comment.</p>
              <p>The stomper needs to go back to driving school and retake
              his BTT <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> </p>

              <p>As i quoted highlighted in bold. The BC is busy driving looking out for the traffic which is the first safety piority. so you can say that these 2 students are quite lucky to escape their act this time but not for long.</p>

              <p>My friend told me that it is specified in some act (think it's Rapid Transit System Act) that no food and drinks are allowed in trains. Therefore, offenders can be fined because it is illegal. However, no similar things are said with regards to buses. Thus even if we see labels and posters in buses, no one is in power to fine the offenders which is what we are seeing now. I do not know how true is this.</p>
              <p>Guess instead of wasting time to post in Stomp, i think these people should write to our dear Raymond Lim to alter some sort of Act to disllow food and drinks in buses. Lol</p>
