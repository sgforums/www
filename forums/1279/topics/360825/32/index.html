                              <p>there is an article on the evening newspaper (cant remember sin

              are driving water themselves on the buses while driving, when SMRT
              is now enforcing the no drinking/eating rules on buses/MRT. So SMRT
              come out and reply that even SLs are NOT allowed to drink even
              plain water while driving.....<br>
              the passengers who complain about SLs/BCs driving water is plain
              stupid.. Imagine the SL/BC drove for two hours and cant take a sip
              at all? SMRT is even worst....give the reason that drinking water
              will dirty the bus so that the SLs also cant drink water.. i think
              this is featured in Stomp.. lazy to go find the article...</p>

              The reason behind banning drinking onboard buses and trains are due to idiots who drink till they spill onto the surroundings and leave the litter behind; just like dirty animals who defecate and unable to clear up after themselves. Then come the cockroaches crawling and multiplying all over the bus. Then going back to history again about complaints on cockroaches infested buses. 
              
              But I think drinking plain water is fine and shouldn't be banned. Probably the authorities slap an absolute ban for fear of idiots trying to be funny and argue their Sprite or 7-Up is plain water when caught. And with all these reasoning, I don't even see why SL should be banned from drinking plain water while driving! I myself is drinking plain water while driving; but of course when stopping at traffic junctions lah.
