              <p>ANGRY that the bus was travelling too slowly for his liking, Lam Wee Yang, 59, scolded the driver before taking matters into his own hands.</p>
              <p>He hit the driver's head with the bag he was carrying and then sent the bus swerving dangerously by grabbing the steering wheel.</p>
              <p>For hurting driver Wei Jin Guang and endangering the safety of 13 passengers on the bus, the coffee-shop assistant was jailed two months and three weeks on Thursday by a district court.</p>
              <p>Lam drank several bottles of beer after finishing his shift at a Geylang coffee shop at 8pm. At 11.45pm, he boarded SBS Transit's number 63 near Lorong 11 Geylang and took the seat behind the driver.</p>

              <p>According to SBS Transit, 11 of its workers were assaulted last year down from 18 the previous year. Bus operator SMRT had six cases in each of those years.</p>

              <p>TNP reported today that a female SMRT bus driver was given a bendy 
              bus to drive when she was actually not qualified to drive bendy buses. 
              The incident happened on July 10 at CCK Int. The bus driver had 
              difficulty reversing a service 302 bendy bus out of its parking lot. 
              After several failed attempts to reverse the bus out, she decided to 
              seek help from the interchange staff. When the staff asked her why, she 
              revealed that she is not qualifed to drive bendy buses.</p>
              <p>SMRT is now investigating the incident. The female BC is now driving a normal 12m bus</p>

              <p>anyway, even normal private buses cheong like mad. ask those NSF or those NSman they should know.
