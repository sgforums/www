              <p><br> " which young local wants to drive these days?" U should ask
              why are there so many cars on the road compared to 2 years ago.
              Another of my friend who works in BBDC told me that there are
              increase in ppl learning driving in their school and that includes
              the FT.</p>
              <p>To satisfy customer, this is the only way. More drivers needed
              but dun forget that M'sia drivers are no longer interested in this
              job.</p>
              <p>Indeed ulu pandan are usually congested free but do not forget
              abt the traffic light along the road. Yesterday, I experienced this
              on Service 502. The bus I took stopped almost all the traffic light
              along the road and cars dashing in from the side caused some
              drivers to jam brakes. Not to forget of the cars along the route
              which are rather high and fast.</p>
              <p>MRT is still the preferred choice of the new generation.</p>

              <p>U said ''MRT is the preferred choice of the new generation.'' I tell u , do u know how crowded it is when its the peak hour period? Take a look at JE @ the morning... The train going towards Pasir Ris is packed to the brim. There are even announcements that are encouraging ppl to take the next train approaching. And , if ppl were to go to places like Industrial parks , how would they go thr? They also need buses rite? At most LRT. Like i said b4 , buses and MRTs play their role.</p>

              <p>The Jurong East is because of the MRT freq being erratic.</p>
              <p><br>Sounds like ex tpt mini star Yeo Cheow Tong. MRT to replace buses. So CCL1 end up so close MRT stations apart resulted in so long running time.</p>
              <p>MRT is only to serve e 'mass' heavy corridor. Feedering leave it to buses. Furthermore trunk rt network is still needed as MRT can't take everyone and some connections best for bus service connection.</p>

              <p>1. SBS Transit or SMRT needs to recruit PRC drivers 1st.</p>
              <p>2. They[SBST , SMRT] need to train the PRC drivers. i.e. How to use the ramp properly on a WAB.</p>

              <p>So , even the high pay that SBST and SMRT is offering to the PRC , some still reject. Easy to employ? I dun think so.</p>

              <p>Easier? Nah. SBST still needs to interview them on their standards , roll out english classes to them , let them be used to right hand drive , route , road safety in S'pore..... U think it's easy? At least Malaysian still uses right hand drive and some of them still know how to communicate using ENGLISH. I would say employing Singaporeans and Malaysian would be easier &gt;.&lt;</p>
