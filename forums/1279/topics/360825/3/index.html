              <p><span>This man made use of water from Kranji Reservoir to wash his bus and left a huge mess in the carpark in the process, says a <strong>STOMPer</strong>. <br><br>Furthermore, the STOMPer says there is a height barrier at the carpark, but the bus driver managed to find a section that was not blocked. <br><br>He comments: <br><br>"These pictures were taken at carpark B, adjoining Kranji Reservoir at Kranji Way. <br><br>"The whole area is under the jurisdiction of the PUB. <br><br>"The height barrier (a yellow and black metal bar) was installed to allow cars to park and keep out heavy vehicles like lorries and buses. The maximum height clearance is only 2m. <br><br>"There is one part of the car park which has no barrier and here you can see a private bus being parked in the car park. It occupied five car park lots. <br><br>"After parking the bus, the driver took a red pail and went to the reservoir to scoop out a pail of free water. <br><br>"He put it beside the bus and used a long brush to clean the windows and windscreen. <br><br>"He also used a cup to scoop water and splash it on the bus. In so doing he caused the nearby cars and the car park to be wet and the floor all slippery. <br><br>"I hope PUB will send its wardens to patrol this car park more frequently and stop these freeloaders from using free water from the reservoir and messing up the carpark."<br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Which bus svc guide is true?</strong></p>
              <p>A <strong>STOMPer</strong> was confused by two bus guides published by Transitlink and Mighty Minds. Both guides state different fare prices for different bus journeys. <br><br>He hopes that the Authority will be able to clarify this. <br><br>Says the STOMPer: <br><br><br>"In the first picture of the TransitLink Guide 2009 published by TransitLink. <br><br>"The booklet costs $2.50. <br><br>"In this booklet the Bus Service number increases from page 105 (Bus service No. 2) till page 448 (Bus Service No 985). <br><br>"Thereafter the pages do not increase with the bus service number. <br><br>"Bus Service No. 530 then starts from page 449 and Bus service No. 581 ends at page 473. <br><br>"On page 101 there are only four examples of calculation of fares for fare stages of 3.5 and 4.5. <br><br>"Beyond fare stage of 4.5 the booklet is silent. <br><br><br>"Whereas in the second picture of BUS GUIDE &amp;amp; BUS-STOP DIRECTORY (2009 Edition), published by Mighty Minds, which costs $3.90, states different prices. <br><br>"In this booklet, the Bus service numbers run in tandem with the page numbers. <br><br>"Bus service No. 2 starts on page 119 and ends with Bus service number 985 on page 460. <br><br>"On page eight, the calculation of bus fares is plain and simple to understand. <br><br>"It tells you that from fare stage 0-4, you pay $0.71 and for fare stage 4.5-7 you pay $0.93. <br>"Beyond 35.5 fare stages you pay $1.67. <br><br>"Which version should commuters follow? <br><br>"Why is there a discrepancy in price? <br><br>"I hope LTA will enlighten commuters so that they buy the correct version."</p>

                      DIRECTORY (2009 Edition), published by Mighty Minds, which costs
                      $3.90, states different prices.<br> <br> "In this booklet, the Bus service numbers run in tandem with the

              <p>the stomper is brainless. Dont know how to see the <strong>HEADING</strong> of the section the fella is looking at. For Transitlink guide, open the freaking back cover of the book for the fare structure.</p>
              <p>For mighty minds, what the stomper saw was the fare structure.</p>
              <p>Its been a million years since the Transitlink guide is out and yet the stomper is dumbfounded by it. Im assuming the stomper is either young or its the first time taking public transport on his/her own</p>

There will also be a notice board to give commuters additional bus service information. <br>    .<br>    Public feedback received from June 1 to Aug 30 will be considered in the final design.
