              <p>Oh yea, SBS8313X got best KUB A/C which i almost forgot..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> Talking abt A/Cs, SBS2773R really needs the A/C fixed since it produced such loud screeching noises when moving off from bus stops/junctions. Took it on svc 175 when i noticed it, but most probably the bus wont get fixed since the bus is an SP. Sorry if im going off topic..</p>

              <div class="photo_text"><span id="lblContent">
              <div>STOMPer <strong>Peggie</strong>'s handphone was nearly stolen by a China national when she was boarding bus 16 at Dhoby Ghaut last evening (May 25).<br><br>This is her account of the incident:<br><br>"My sister urged me to send an email to STOMP so that more people can be informed about it.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I finished my night closing shift and was waiting for bus home from Dhoby Exchange bus stop going towards Orchard. I was messaging my boyfriend, while waiting for the bus to come.<br><br>"When the bus arrived, I locked my phone and placed in back in my front right pocket with my stylus and chain hanging outside the pocket.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"When the bus stopped, a big guy boarded and asked the driver if it was going Orchard. I was waiting directly behind him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Suddenly I felt someone bumping against me and my phone slipping out of my pocket! I could not hear my bell attached to my mobile too!<br><br>"I immediately grabbed the person, who was wearing white and carry a backpack, as he tried to squeeze past the first guy who was blocking the way.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I asked him fairly loudly, 'Excuse me, did you just took my phone?!' and he 'dropped' my phone in front of him and mumbled something along the line of 'ehh, how come your phone is here.'</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"He then kicked my phone back towards me! I was still standing on the steps waiting to board. I grabbed my phone, boarded the bus and took a seat near the exit. <br><br>"From his voice, it is immediately recognisable that he is a China national.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I checked whether my phone was intact and proceeded to message my boyfriend about the incident.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"The time was then 10:08pm. I noticed that a few persons saw the commotion near the entrance, and I believe someone should have seen him taking my phone.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"But sad to say, they pretended nothing happened and went back to staring into nothingness. <br><br>"I am very disappointed that no one came to my help, and while I was describing what happened to me to my sisters and friends, the man alighted at the Orchard stop just a few stops after we boarded.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I am lucky that I felt my phone slipping out because I was wearing a tight denim skirt and was able to get my phone back. <br><br>"I hope that people take note of their belongings while in crowded places and especially if someone bumps against you and you feel something is wrong. "<br><br>"According to my dad and my friends, I should have held on to him and reported him to the bus captain and the police. What if he claims that my phone got catch on his bag or something and he did not picked it out of my pocket?"</div>

              <p><a id="3" name="3"></a><strong>Why does the Bus Captain drive so slowly? <br></strong><span class="bodytxt">We hope commuters can appreciate that traffic conditions on the road can vary. Our schedules, however, can only be planned to meet what is usually the expected traffic condition at the various times of the day. There will be times when the traffic conditions are unusually clear or congested and this often results in buses being too early or late.<br><br>When traffic conditions are especially clear, our Bus Captains are required to regulate speed if they notice that they are ahead of schedule. This ensures that the Bus Captains keep the arrival times at the bus stops as close to the planned schedule as possible to avoid any disruption like bus bunching.<br><br>From the perspective of the passengers on board the bus, the journey seems slow but to the passengers waiting at the bus stops along the route, they expect their bus to arrive on time as scheduled. Nonetheless, we will monitor our buses closely and make appropriate adjustments to the running time when necessary. </span></p>
