              <p><br> Wow they finally fined 857. I'm not surprised at all. Given that
              they refuse to deploy weekday bendies on this service it comes as
              no surprise why the frequency can be screwed up. Loading is so high
              as this is the only route linking town to Yishun fastest, but I
              cannot comprehend why WLDEP refuses to deploy weekday bendies.
              Weekend bendies were meant for the weekend crowd, but I find
              weekend bendies more un-utilised as compared to the loadings during
              weekdays. I once waited 25 mins during evening peak at SOTA
              and 3 packed 857s came together. It says alot about it's demand
              during critical hours. A bendy would safely take care of that.</p>
              <p>As a Yishun resident myself, I don't take the train to town
              unless it's urgent because Toa Payoh and southbound thereafter is a
              packed nightmare. I can choose 171 or 857 but 171 is seriously too
              long to town. So 857 is my only choice, and many other Yishun folks
              would take that service too. 45 mins to town, who wouldn't want
              that?</p>
              <p>Another thing is that this service is a loop service, given that
              CTE may jam once in a while it affects the return direction's
              frequency. I hope they consider making 857 a bi-directional service
              so as to cut down on the irregular frequency in the return
              direciton.</p>
              <p>Time to wake up WLDEP. Alot of WLDEP services don't need so many
              bendies. 857 needs them more.</p>

              <p>SMRT believes that it makes more sense to deploy bendies to their feeder services rather than normal trunk service.</p>
              <p>This is called customer service. The moment you alight from the train, you'll be able to get a space on your feeder bus back home. Whats the use of having a bendy on a trunk service when 80% of the time it get stuck in the CTE jam ? It would probably bring in more revenue for the organisation by running non-stop on their feeder routes.</p>
              <p>Trains are more important to them. Afterall, SMRT Buses is just a liability to the organisation to begin with.</p>
              <p>You think they care about that $100 being lost to PTC (or LTA) ? Its nothing to them anyway, i believe they can easily earn more from their passengers who take train from Yishun to town on a single train trip.</p>

              <p><br>I'm not saying we shouldn't neglect feeders. Feeders in essence are an important connection to our homes from "transfer hubs". What I'm suggesting is for bendies to be redeployed from normal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trunk</span> routes with a lower demand.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry but they do care. This week I've been seeing bendies appearing on weekdays. It's nice to see them springing into action so quickly. Perhaps $100 means nothing to them but the concensus behind the fine means alot to them. In fact bendies have been appearing on weekday split shift slots since mid-March.</p>

              <p>See !!! <br><br>It only goes to show that they do not intend to do anything to improve the service at all. I'm sure the "increased" bendies put into the fleet recently will be out of the fleet faster than you can type the next post.</p>
              <p>The next time people start to complaint anything regarding to SMRT Buses, i'm very sure they will just ask you to take their feeder service and transfer to CCL/EWL/NSL.</p>

              girls lost his temper and shouted at the top of his voice at the
              girls asking them to move behind.He told me tat the man screamed if
              there was a 'hantu' at the back of the bus tat y tis girls keep
