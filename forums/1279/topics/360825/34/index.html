              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Parliament: Central bus route planning</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority has been making good progress in preparation for its role as a bus network planner.</p>
              <p>Giving an update in parliament, Second Minister for Transport, Lim
              Hwee Hua says it has already developed a draft Bus Routes Master Plan,
              which will serve as the blueprint for basic bus services.</p>
              <p>This aims to benefit as many commuters as possible while maintaining the overall financial viability of the bus system.</p>
              <p>"LTA has started to hold a series of consultations with the Advisors
              and grassroot leaders of all the Group Representative and Single-Member
              Constituencies, to share its assessment and discuss potential
              improvements to the bus services in each constituency. The aim is to
              solicit feedback and suggestions on how best to improve the bus
              network. "</p>
              <p>Mrs Lim says, LTA targets to complete this series of consultations by the first quarter of 2010.</p>
              <p>It will then seek approval from the Public Transport Council for the
              finalised bus routes, before gradually rolling the changes out.</p>
              <p>She stresses that commuters remain at the centre of all the planning
              and there has been a lot of informal consultations with them.</p>
              <p>"Commuters at large are welcome to contribute their input through
              the usual hotlines through either the LTA or PTC and all input will be
              put together. There'll be consultations beyond just the GRCs and and
              SMCs."</p>
              <p>That's because a lot of the bus route planning revolves around the townships as well, says Mrs Lim.</p>

              <p><strong><span class="newsTitle">Parliament: Shorter waiting times for buses</span></strong></p>
              <p>Eighty percent of buses will now have to leave bus interchanges and
              terminals every ten minutes or less during weekday peak periods -
              earlier than the previous 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Speaking in parliament, Second Minister for Transport, Lim Hwee Hua
              says this has been the case since the 1st of August this year, when the
              Public Transport Council tightened the Quality of Service standards for
              bus services.</p>
              <p>She highlights that 90 percent of feeder buses now have to leave
              interchanges and terminals every ten minutes or less - up from the
              previous 85 per cent.</p>
              <p>Operators have also added more than 260 bus trips to 109 services during the morning and evening peak periods.</p>
              <p>Frequencies for these services have improved by 18 per cent and their carrying capacity by 24 per cent, says Mrs Lim.</p>
              <p>"I would like to assure Members of the House that under the
              price-cap formula, operators have to absorb the cost of these
              improvements, and are not allowed to pass them on to commuters in the
              form of higher fares. Under the formula, fare adjustments are
              determined by overall economic indicators, namely the change in the
              Consumer Price index referred to as CPI and the national Wage Index or
              the WI, and not the operatorsâ specific costs. "</p>
              <p>She stresses that the cost of buying new buses and operating additional bus trips will not affect fares.</p>
              <p>However, in raising Quality of Service standards, the Council has to
              be mindful of the impact on the financial viability of the operators.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Parliament: Central bus route
              planning</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Land Transport Authority has been making good progress in
              preparation for its role as a bus network planner.</p>
              <p>Giving an update in parliament, Second Minister for Transport,
              Lim Hwee Hua says it has already developed a draft Bus Routes
              Master Plan, which will serve as the blueprint for basic bus
              services.</p>
              <p>This aims to benefit as many commuters as possible while
              maintaining the overall financial viability of the bus system.</p>
              <p>"LTA has started to hold a series of consultations with the
              Advisors and grassroot leaders of all the Group Representative and
              Single-Member Constituencies, to share its assessment and discuss
              potential improvements to the bus services in each constituency.
              The aim is to solicit feedback and suggestions on how best to
              improve the bus network. "</p>
              <p>Mrs Lim says, LTA targets to complete this series of
              consultations by the first quarter of 2010.</p>
              <p>It will then seek approval from the Public Transport Council for
              the finalised bus routes, before gradually rolling the changes
              out.</p>
              <p>She stresses that commuters remain at the centre of all the
              planning and there has been a lot of informal consultations with
              them.</p>
              <p>"Commuters at large are welcome to contribute their input
              through the usual hotlines through either the LTA or PTC and all
              input will be put together. There'll be consultations beyond just
              the GRCs and and SMCs."</p>
              <p>That's because a lot of the bus route planning revolves around
              the townships as well, says Mrs Lim.</p>

              <p>Last time on TIB868X happen this incident too. The BC open door for 10sec and closed it but there are still some who have not alight. So everyone in the bus shouted and even scold the BC.</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>The BC will skip busstop even if the bell is pressed before reaching the busstop(1-2 Years back on TIB1032J svc 911)</p>
