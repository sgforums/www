              <p><br>I'm saying this again, where are you going to find buses overnight when all those projects complete? You say 502 go bi-directional w/ 15 mins freq, ok.. But later dun kpkb tat why Tuas cannot get new bus svs or why cannot have new bus svs for Seletar.</p>
              <p>The MRT cannot be everywhere being costly. So you telling me govt build dedicated MRT line for Seletar Aerospace Hub, NTU, SUTD?? Unless you dun mind paying more tax or higher fares. MRT can never fully replace buses.</p>
              <p>If you do not know, it's faster to take Sv 7 to Clementi vs MRT. Not to mention 111 to Queenstown.</p>

              <p><br>More bus means more job opportunities.Similarly more bus service means more  job opportunities. Just a call to china, they can supply u 100 over ppl to take up the job. I had been in the recruitment line before, i dun see any issue with it. I am satisfied with the new route and I dun need 502 to go bi-directional. This is a matter of time, ppl will get use.</p>
              <p>Can u tell me the freq for service 7 ? MRT freq more consistent or bus? MRT may have human jam but bus will meet traffic jam, human jam. What u say, maybe bus 7 will be faster in the night. Pls do not look this issue in a bus fan attitude, which one is faster and least chances to jam we all know.</p>

              <p><br>True. But which young local wants to drive these days? Actually it's been a issue all these while if one ever read MM Lee's books over SBS.</p>
              <p>We could get drivers from M'sia or PRC, but issue is the turnover rate for latter we do not know yet. At e same time all fleet addition are gradual, we can't do it overnight.</p>
              <p>Even my friend in LTA would agree w/ me over Sv 7. I think u own yourself over Ulu Pandan Rd before over 502. Since it's usually congested free, isn't it benefical for Sv 7? As for Eastern side, there's a thing call bus lane.</p>
              <p>As for MRT, MRT freq these days aren't consistent either. Peak hr also affected, suddenly 1 min, suddenly 6 mins, suddenly 4 mins.</p>
              <p>I'm not looking in bus fan world, I'm looking for overall travel needs. LTA can also tell you bus are useful as quite a big chunk of connection is faster by bus.</p>

              <p>as for MRT versus buses.</p>
              <p>I'll mention this even to those in SMRT who keeps on thinking buses overall are useless than MRT.</p>
              <p>It's only densely populated cities tat no choice gotta invest millions into excavating tunnels to build MRT. Not many country as rich either to invest this amt of money upfront.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere everyone goes for BRT because it's so versatile n cheaper to operate. Versatile as in it's fast like MRT w/ dedicated bus lanes and can also function as a bus serving minor bus stops for non express routes.</p>

              <p><br>" which young local wants to drive these days?" U should ask why are there so many cars on the road compared to 2 years ago. Another of my friend who works in BBDC told me that there are increase in ppl learning driving in their school and that includes the FT.</p>
              <p>To satisfy customer, this is the only way. More drivers needed but dun forget that M'sia drivers are no longer interested in this job.</p>
              <p>Indeed ulu pandan are usually congested free but do not forget abt the traffic light along the road. Yesterday, I experienced this on Service 502. The bus I took stopped almost all the traffic light along the road and cars dashing in from the side caused some drivers to jam brakes. Not to forget of the cars along the route which are rather high and fast.</p>
              <p>MRT is still the preferred choice of the new generation.</p>

              More bus means more job opportunities.Similarly more bus service
              means more  job opportunities. Just a call to china, they can
              supply u 100 over ppl to take up the job. I had been in the
              recruitment line before, i dun see any issue with it. I am
              satisfied with the new route and I dun need 502 to go
              bi-directional. This is a matter of time, ppl will get use.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I shall debunk all the facts here:<br><br><strong>1) Some people do not own their cars as it is too expensive</strong><br>I would like to emphasise on this, some people would rather rely on public transport to get to their desired destination. If people would own a car even using it on off-peak or weekends, he/she will have to purchase COE, Road Tax and Insurance, etc, on top of the cost of the car alone. Besides that, if their petrol runs low, he/she would have to spend time driving to the nearest petrol kiosk to get their tanks fill up, paying for the petrol.  As for the Supplementary Driving License for Off-Peak Cars, one must log in to the LTA One Motoring Website (ROV) to get the coupon online.<br><br><strong>2) Most people do not rely on MRT alone, Bus is another alternative option.</strong><br>MRT do not cater to the needs of the people relying on public transport. The set up of TransitLink is there to integrate the entire public transprot system. Yes of course, when the 1st Transitlink Integration Exercise took place, some residents who frequented the service went to complain to the Straits Times Froum and even to their MPs, citing one example like the abolishment of 147 to Potong Pasir Estate and the longest travelling time on Service 82. However, TransitLink is able to respond to the feedbacks and the reason behind it is integration of the public transport, not the form of inconvenience the resdents surfaced.<br><br>If TransitLink leads to failure, or if the two bus service companies decided to simply withdrawn or cutback the service just because of the MRT nearby, without any weak constraints or a passenger survey carried out, more problems will be created and people will start to feedback on their unhappiness to the bus companies and even to the MPs. That's why Buses must also play a part, because not everyone lives nearby or a short walking distance close to the MRT.<br><br>TransitLink is there for a reason, to provide the integrated benefits for everone using the public transport. Without that, there might be some wasteful resources and duplication on bus services which were unnoticed when the MRT began to operate.<br><br><strong>3) If there are feedbacks on a particular route, it does not mean that the service is either to be diverted elsewhere, cutback or even to be withdrawn with that feedback.</strong><br>Some people who rely on that particluar service will STILL be deemed useful to them, thats why the routes were kept intact within their needs. The problem is if the service were to divert, cutback or withdrawn without a proper sruvey and usefulness of teh service, as again, some people will have to take alternative service or walk nearby to a bus stop to take a nearest bus service to get to their desired destination and the journey/waiting time and fares spent will be higher than usual.</p></div>

              <p>U know why? Coz woodlands transport is not a public transport operator. Indeed , u might think it's easy to recruit PRC drivers for WT transport. But , think again.</p>
              <p>1. SBS Transit or SMRT needs to recruit PRC drivers 1st.</p>
              <p>2. They[SBST , SMRT] need to train the PRC drivers. i.e. How to use the ramp properly on a WAB.</p>
              <p>3.Remember this , PRCs are not used to right hand drive as their country is left handed driving.</p>
              <p>So , even the high pay that SBST and SMRT is offering to the PRC , some still reject. Easy to employ? I dun think so.</p>
