              <p>A <strong>STOMPer</strong> was confused by two bus guides published by Transitlink and Mighty Minds.

              <p><strong>Hard braking cost SBS Transit $82,000</strong></p>
              <p>SBS Transit was ordered to pay $82,000 in compensation to a woman who has difficulty walking after she fell on a service 372 bus.</p>
              <p>The incident happened on April 28, 2004. The woman was sitting opposite her sister in a four-seater seat. The bus was travelling along Compassvale Drive when the driver suddenly slammed hard on the brakes while approaching a traffic light.</p>
              <p>The impact caused the woman to be thrown off her seat. She lurched forward and hit her sister's knees. She suffered tenderness on her chest, wrists, right ankle, right shoulder and swelling and tenderness on her left ankle.</p>
              <p>The woman told the court that she did not inform the driver immediately after the incident as she was scared of the bus driver who had driven in such a dangerous manner.</p>
              <p>In its defence, SBS Transit denied the incident had happened and that it was a fake story the woman had made up.</p>
              <p>When the bus driver took the stand, he said he could not recall the incident and that he came to know about it only when he was called up by his employer following the woman's complaint. But the bus driver admitted in court he later received a police warning over it.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit initially offered the woman $3,500 in 2004 but she rejected the amount and filed a suit 3 years later after her condition showed no improvement.</p>
              <p>Long story cut short, although the woman won the case, she was unhappy with the amount awarded and is appealing to get more money.</p>
