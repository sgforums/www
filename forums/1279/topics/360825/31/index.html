              identification. I explained to him that I had actually forgotten to
              bring my ez-link card.<br> <br> "I understand sometimes some bus captains do ask students to pay
              adult fares as they have no identification. Instead, the bus driver
              started to scold me!<br> <br> "He scolded and said: "Forget to bring, forget to bring! Forget to
              bring don't board a bus lah!"<br> <br> "I know some bus captains may be afraid that they would get into
              trouble if passengers do not pay the correct fare.<br> <br> "However, he did not asked me to pay the adult fare and scolded me
              right in front of everybody.<br> <br> "This is ridiculous! My mum and I hope to get an explanation from
