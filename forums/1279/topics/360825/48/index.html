              otherwise not only takes up space (just bec the bus isn't crowded at

              I refused as I did not see the rationale. Why can wheelchairs be taken aboard the bus but strollers cannot? Moreover, the bus was practically empty and there were no wheelchair passengers on board.</div>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><em>i'm not sure if you did not or could not/did not want to see. you obviously can't fold a wheelchair when it is occupied by a disabled person but you can pick up the baby and fold the stroller, which otherwise not only takes up space (just bec the bus isn't crowded at point of boarding doesn't mean it can't get crowded along the way - this is sg, mind you!) but is also dangerous bec in sg there is nothing to strap the stroller/wheelchair to a fixed point. moreover, the wheelchair-bound person may be able to hold on to the railing next to him/her, certainly not the baby.</em></span></p>

              <p>I disagree with the last part in brown.<br>I'll break it down here so we all get a better understanding.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #800000;">you obviously can't fold a wheelchair when it is occupied by a disabled person</span></em></p>
              <p>True.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #800000;">pick up the baby and fold the stroller</span></em></p>
              <p>OK, let's see how many different scenarios I can make of this one.</p>
              <p>1: While waiting for the bus, put the baby on a seat (nearly impossible these days with those thin metal seats) and then fold the stroller (that requires two hands). What if, the baby rolled off the seat? Let's not forget this is a single person we're talking about.<br>You can say, ask members of the public to help. Will they? Some Singaporeans are nice about it and may even offer without asking. But more often than not, they're not very nice.</p>
              <p>2: So baby cradled in one arm, stroller in the other. How is she going to tap the card? Moreover, it's a sleeping baby - she's not gonna tap the card while the baby's in her arms and then let the ear-blastingly loud BEEP wake the baby?</p>
              <p>3: Roll onboard the bus - then fold. But the driver already disallows her from doing so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think things like these should be viewed on a case by case basis. If it's a regular stepped bus like our Volvos and O405's, then rolling a pram up is unreasonable. B10M's have no standee space, and while the O405's have standee space, it isn't quite as big or wide as a KUB's or B9's. So on a WAB bus that is practically empty then I think it's OK to let prams on.</p>
              <p>Companies should be more flexible in handling matters like this.</p>
              <p>And on other matters like the one where the bus was being held up for hours due to an unreasonable passenger, that should be taken care of in a stern and professional manner. And I don't mean free taxi ride to shut them up. Wheelchairs are bigger than prams (I'm comparing the 2 instances here), and even then, that's not a WAB bus with the proper facilities. In the news picture I didn't see said mother on wheelchair on board the bus, so I guess said PRC's haven't actually carried said mother on.<br>I'd like to see them do that without actually having the wheelchair get stuck at the turning after the doors, or without it crashing into something.</p>
              <p>Yeah, yeah, wheelchair has brakes, some might say, but given the O405's 'rolly' character I'll see if it can stay straight while BC makes a wide turn.</p>

              <p>I agreed that it should be folded up when boarded the bus.</p>
