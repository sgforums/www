I assume that you are asking for CCK, the service is Tibs 302.<br><br>7. The correct phrase for "Army Training School" should be SAFTI Military Institute. Beside it is S'pore Discovery Centre.

SAF Ferry Terminal.<br><br>10. Currently, there are no direct service to Poly Marina, the nearest one is Tibs 176. Tibs 189 has been amended not to serve Poly Marina but to serve Harbour Drive (189A).<br><br>11. Tibs 176 &amp; 963, Hillview Circus<br>Tibs 67 &amp; 960, Newton Circus<br><br>12.

Both Shenton Way terminal and Marina Centre terminal are located under the expressway (ECP).<br><br>2. This maze garden is located in Pasir Ris Park. You can either board SBST 354 or 403 to get there.<br><br>3. SBST 401, East Coast Park.<br>Tibs 926, Zoo &amp; Night Safari.<br><br>4. Jalan Kayu terminal.<br><br>5. SBST 231.<br><br>6. Jurong West and Choa Chu Kang are called "Ghost Towns", because of the high vacant rate in new HDB flats. I assume that you are asking for CCK, the service is Tibs 302.<br><br>7. The correct phrase for "Army Training School" should be SAFTI Military Institute. Beside it is S'pore Discovery Centre. SBST 193 is the only service to ply there (Upp Jurong Rd).<br><br>8. SBST 317. Someone mentioned SBST 42 in earlier reply but it is not a feeder service.<br><br>9. Pasir Ris Interchange. SAF Ferry Terminal.<br><br>10. Currently, there are no direct service to Poly Marina, the nearest one is Tibs 176. Tibs 189 has been amended not to serve Poly Marina but to serve Harbour Drive (189A).<br><br>11. Tibs 176 &amp; 963, Hillview Circus<br>Tibs 67 &amp; 960, Newton Circus<br><br>12. SBST 6, Loyang Tua Peh Kong Temple.<br><br>13. Jurong Fishery Port, SBST 98<br>Senoko Fishing Port (Does it sells fish?), Tibs 856 and 981 (nearby)<br><br>14. Tibs 900, Woodlands 888 Plaza.<br><br>15. The answer can be Mount Faber Park or Telok Blangah Hill Park (I'm not sure). But I assume that you are not asking for Mount Faber as it is accessible from at least 4 roads.<br><br>16. Labrador terminal. The service can be 166 or 215 or others (I'm not very sure for 215)<br><br>17. Jalan Bahagia.<br></div></blockquote>Great to hear from you!

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I would like to clarify with you on question 10. This long narrow hill-top may or may not exist now, but from the name of this terminal only, it means a long narrow hill-top. Doesn't matter if it's really on a hill-top or not. I have edited the question.<br><br>For question 7, this round-about is in the east and only this service loops at this round-about. Other services just pass by it. I have also edited the question to include the name.<br></div>
