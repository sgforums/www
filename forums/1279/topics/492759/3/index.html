              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, let's look at things carefully before you make a
              fool of yourself. Who in the right mind will introduce both 1 and
              507 having same route of SengKang interchange to changi airport?
              Note you remove 27 and 858 at TPE stop from airport and replace
              with either 967 and 507. So how does equation work out? Need me
              explain further?</p>
              <p>By busanalyser concept, TPE stop left with 507. 967 totally skip
              TPE stop.</p>
              <p>Currently, 27/34/858. Now left with 507/34. Can work? Let those
              logical people think it out. From 3 services squeeze to
              2? </p>
              <p>People who used to take 858 drop off at TPE stop to transfer to
              other services like 118 can no longer do so. Because 967 does not
              stop at TPE stop. </p>
              <p>Now any reviews about your intitial thoughts? If no, I got
              nothing to say. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I thimk you are the fool...</p>
              <p>1/507 refers to the DIFFERENCE in numbers... It is essentially one svc... I put it this way since there are disputes whether it should be Express... So there, you made a fool of yourself for not bothering to read. </p>
              <p>Another evidence you not reading... There is another svc 108... This essentially covers the entire 27 sector, other than the Hougang - Airport journey which no one in the right mind would take... Maybe you do since you are exactly that</p>
              <p>Regarding 27/34/858... This is the extreme minority who happens to live super near the TPE stops... And for this 3 down to 2 is more than enough... In fact if you ask me this isnt even a valid point to begin with, since majority will just wait for 858 only anyway...</p>
              <p>And I ask you uh, who even bloody transfers from 858 to like say 118? Definitely not from the north to the east coz dozens of svc eg. 969 and 39 would've taken care of the needs of the majority... As for airport to Punggol there is the new 1/507...</p>
              <p>See, we could never hold back coz of the small minority... By doing so we are forgoing the interests of many others... Is this the peogress that we want to see?</p>
              <p>My reviews of my initial thoughts are clear, it's you who really need to read carefully... I bet you dont even know what the route of 1/507 is...</p>
              <p>And if you still dont realise it now, I also got nothing to say about your ignorance... Consider either a brain or eye check...</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB1368T, that is the problem when people keep saying skip here skip there, keep streamlining the buses when in actual fact, population increase so much more, especially on the outskirts of Punggol and Seng Kang. </p>
              <p>From current 27/34/858 (3 services) going to airport in different styles to only 34/507 (2 services) going to airport by their proposals. Moreover, 967 passes by and still skips TPE stop some more! Hey guys, population bloom leh. More and more people come to Singapore leh. How can still reduce bus services? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Service 108 I did read. But no purpose at all. Hougang to airport sector is much needed. Why cut it up and make people transfer? Why? What is the purpose? Provide alternative to people is to cut route up?</p>
              <p>Service 27/34/858 doing ok. Why not a valid point? There are still many taking SBS 27 to airport from TPE stop. Why you keep assuming nobody take? They preferred 858 but still many hopped on to 27.</p>
              <p>It is not because of the small minority that is holding people back. The transport planners need to consider everybody needs (majority and all) and balance it with the most optimum resources it will need. Or else you will see most buses to airport on express modes. Now it tends to bring most parts of the singaporeans houses to airport instead of express. </p>

              <p>Hougang to airport sector is minimal as the route is way too long. Dont be myopic — nobody takes the full route of 27 man. Some of them have the much faster 53, and others 27 to 858. So no, 27 HG to airport sector is virtually redundant, contrary to your claims. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, this means all those who have been traveling from hougang/buangkok/Sengkang to airport all these years on direct bus 27 are myopic. I am also myopic. LTA is also myopic. Only you are not myopic as you see full picture. </p>
              <p>However lucky for all of us who are myopic, the current bus route in Singapore is as planned for all of us who are very myopic. Really very lucky for all of us that we have a direct sbs 27. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>When I designed the route, I made 967 stop at Jalan Kayu because 858 does as well and is transfer point for Sengkang West / YCK Road residents to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>For TPE stop, since I proposed new service 1 from Sengkang going non-stop to Changi Airport after TPE stop, this connection is maintained. </p>
              <p>Moreover TPE stop will have 39, 969 to Yishun, Chong Pang and 168 to Woodlands. </p>

              <p>My friend... all those years you didnt have a choice because there was no TPE stop for transfer. Now there is 858 but it is already crowded and full when it comes from Yishun side to airport. </p>
              <p>Hence, the Sengkang-Airport service I have proposed takes people from NEL to Airport in just 4 stops. I think they will love it and welcome the decision + it will relieve loading on 858 (which I also made express with 967).</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, 201 should also not take the Jurong Townhall flyover but call at the two bus stops along AYE but it doesn't because the purpose of 201 is to bring people from Clementi to Penjuru/Teban Gardens faster. </p>
              <p>27 will become 108 with full fleet DDs. I think people will love this as well. Anyway, I am not going to continue explaining to you because we have had many fights on your way of thinking on this topic before, but I still try to explain you, in case you want to have a more open mind on how this suggestion will be good for all.</p>
