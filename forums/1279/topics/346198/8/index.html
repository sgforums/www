            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys, if there is any disputes of anybody pictures, do settle in PRIVATE, not on the thread. Don't bring the matter WORSE, it won't help to solve the problem faster. I don't encourage people flaming against other forum users out of nowhere. I'm very sure that everyone is able to behave mature enough and to able to tackle the problem without having to criticise someone else pix. I guess no one likes it to get exposed by flaming by other forum users, so don't keep posting off-topic on any thread to find trouble at anytime. Do keep in mind, that some users will NOT reply back to your nonsense and hence you will be ignored.</div>

              <p>Honestly speaking, Oceane and I were not even talking about you. Why get so worked up? I was just saying KR1850's pic has nicely portrayed bus panning shots, and compared to the rest, it is one of the nicest I've seen, and maybe some who are interested can consult, why not?</p>
              <p>You are over sensitive and jumped to conclusion that we are professionals and using DSLRs. I am sad to say, we don't.</p>
              <p>If you are willing to learn, can you be rejected? It is the attitude in you. You may think you are right and we are wrong now.</p>

              <p>Honestly speaking, Oceane and I were not even talking about you.
                  Why get so worked up? I was just saying KR1850's pic has nicely
                  portrayed bus panning shots, and compared to the rest, it is one of
                  the nicest I've seen, and maybe some who are interested can
                  consult, why not?</p>
              <p>You are over sensitive and jumped to conclusion that we are
                  professionals and using DSLRs. I am sad to say, we don't.</p>
              <p>If you are willing to learn, can you be rejected? It is the
                  attitude in you. You may think you are right and we are wrong

              <p>Please look at Jan's thread. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Even if it were not referring to him, why must you guys insult someone that way? I don't see a need to. And obviously - or so I believe - we know who you are referring to, and the person has spoken.</p>
              <p>Also, he has stated that he knows you guys are not referring to him, hasn't that been the case?</p>

              <p>eh bro..</p>
              <p>im not oversensitive here, nor I was refferring to myself while replying. Is it wrong to reply on their behalf?</p>
              <p>you typed like as if you are a professional, indeed, you are indirectly shooting someone who you did not named, and i did not say im one of them.</p>
              <p>im willing to learn, but not like this. i dont learn things the hard way. i learn in the easy way. isnt it better if you guys commented politely? and not indirectly shooting people around? again, i said i did not say im one of them.. rejected? what abt criticise? isnt it a better word, in terms of photography?</p>
              <p>mind my words? ha! had the joke of my life. you shld use words that are polite too.. if you want others to respect your comment, make sure you are going to respect them with your comments too..</p>
              <p>hah, i've been to many places, consulted experts in buses or whatever arena im interested in.</p>

Bus Fan take photo of buses for enjoyment , yet you guys keep complaining that his / her photo sucks ... the person tend to be stress and focus on phototaking of buses ... what's the point ? enjoyment ? i don't think so this thread have being making ppl stress , one more, Bus Fanning is not a subject , it's not included in PSLE and N/O/A Levels , SBS2695H told me that after so many comments bout his not so good photos last time , he felt stress ... everyone ask yourself What's the point ?
