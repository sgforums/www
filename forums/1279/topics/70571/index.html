            <div class='col-md body'>London's famous red buses may soon be gone<br><br>Londoners campaign against move to scrap the buses which have been on the city's roads since 1954<br><br>By NEO HUI MIN<br>FOR THE STRAITS TIMES<br><br>LONDON - The iconic red double-deckers that have become part of the streetscape here for half a century will be replaced by modern bendy buses, but there are some campaigning against this move.<br>Advertisement<br><br>Introduced in 1954, these buses, called Routemasters, have already been withdrawn from four routes.<br><br>Buses on two of the remaining 16 routes will go next month and those on another two routes will be axed by summer.<br><br>By the end of next year, there will be only two dozen plying on the 'heritage route' for tourists.<br><br>Mr Ben Brook, who is running a Save The Routemaster campaign, told The Straits Times that the buses are one of the symbols of London and should not be withdrawn.<br><br>'They are like Big Ben, like important symbolic buildings of the city, except that they move on the roads,' he said.<br><br>And even though they are old, the buses 'still serve a practical purpose for Londoners', he added.<br><br>He said he wants to raise awareness of the Routemasters' demise because the Transport for London (TFL) has been replacing them 'quietly'.<br><br>'Since I started the website, people have e-mailed me to tell me how angry they are that the Routemasters are disappearing,' he said.<br><br>More than 550 signatures have also been collected by a group calling itself the Save The 73, for a Ban The Bendy petition.<br><br>The Conservative Party's mayoral candidate Steve Norris has seized the opportunity to garner votes from Routemaster supporters by promising to save the buses if elected.<br><br>So far, the TFL has not shown any signs of reversing its decision.<br><br>Ms Clare Kavanagh, London Buses' director for performance, said in a statement the buses were 'around 40 years old and at the end of their effective lives'.<br><br>She said they would be 'replaced by a fleet of the latest easy-access, low-floor buses which are more convenient for passengers, particularly those with children, shopping or mobility problems'.<br><br>Mr Brook doesn't buy this. He said many of the buses have been refurbished with new engines.<br><br>'Other than their exterior, the buses are brand new, really.'<br><br>Besides , the new buses will not have conductors on board to help the less mobile passengers.<br><br>'If you're talking about wheelchair access, I'll have to admit that the Routemasters aren't very good for that. But conductors are on board the Routemasters to help people with other disabilities, such as the blind,' said Mr Brook.<br><br>Motorists, taxi drivers and cyclists also complain that the new 18m-long buses are taking up too much space on narrow London streets and slowing down traffic.<br><br>They also have fewer seats compared to the older buses.<br><br>According to Ms Samantha Horley, who started the Save The 73 campaign, the capacity for a bendy bus is 49 seated passengers and 86 standing ones.<br><br>In comparison, the Routemaster seats 72 of its 77 passenger capacity.<br><br>Mr Brook hopes that attempts will be made to remake the Routemaster.<br><br>'At a time when it's fashionable to remake classic vehicles, like the VW beetle, the Mini and the London black cab, it would be a lovely idea to remake the Routemaster as well,' he said.<br><br>'New versions of classic vehicles all have had great success here.'<br><br>What do you think of this  article. In my opinion, they should keep the buses or remake them.<br><br>I think they should not buy bendy buses. Bendys are too long and not many seating capacity</div>
