              <p>For me, well for SBS Transit, i can't really say what buses to
              joyride because I haven't been exposed to alot of SBST buses.<br> <br> As for SMRT, i would probably recommend these few buses, sorry if
              these buses are already mentioned, because all except TIB1049L's
              replies are pages way back. Amd im sorry if I sound like telling
              some story, but i just want to recommend these buses.</p>
              <p>TIB425R and TIB426M have power, and has special turbo. Both have
              great aircon and they are probably a good 61 joyride.<br> TIB442R has power, good aircon, is very clean and still maintains
              the change of gear from 0-1-2. (: But don't take the bus when the
              white-haired SL is driving, he jerks the bus all the time.<br> TIB471G and TIB472D are speedsters of 700! Very fast buses, and
              they were fast too under WLDEP.<br> TIB481C has that new-ish smell and runs like an airplane, the
              transmission is also quite unique.<br> TIB515P has that AMDEP-ish sound though she is from KJDEP.
              Transmission is very unique! And don't be fooled when this bus is
              slow, actually she can go quite fast, depending on who's the
              driver...<br> TIB567P has a unique pickup and bell. The brake sound has some
              higher-pitched sound at the end if you listen carefully.<br> TIB577K has power and still maintains that AMDEP
              transmission.<br> TIB588D, like what TIB1049L said, has a special transmission, but
              also can speed and she fairs the hills quite well on 173!<br> TIB595H also is quite good, and has speed. Though at points the bus
              may be weak.<br> TIB602X has freezing aircon, special turbo and also has that
              constipated pickup.<br> TIB668G also is quite a fast scania, still remember this bus
              speeding on Mandai Avenue while she was WLDEP 171. But she vibrates
              violently, a true OSIM...</p>

              <p>Funny thing as a fact, once leaving the checkpoint on the non-diverted route, all the way to Kranji MRT (cannot run on a 90 degrees turn), and then after Kranji MRT all the way to Bt Panjang, the BC can run at 60-80 km/h, with sections hitting to 90 plus if the bus can do it mechanically.</p>
              <p>To a China or seasoned s178 BC, no road is too narrow for them. I mean trips at 2200 and after. Daytime different because of more cars on the roads.</p>
              <p>I would recommend, well not very useful anyways cause its a obviously a bus with an obvious positive rating: SBS997A.</p>
              <p>Reason? Smooth engine performance. Not talking about the special points because its a special bus... <a href="329035?page=6#"><img src="http://172.31.254.244/www.sgforums.comm/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png?1208925295" alt="Wink"></a></p>

              <p>If we're gonna talk gears here, why not let's share some views?</p>
              <p>As far as I can tell, Voith's 1st gear is usually the close equivalent of ZF's 1st 2 gears.</p>
              <p>Hence the way both gearboxes function differently lie greatly in this initial stage.</p>
              <p>As far as I understand, ZF locks-up either in 1st or 2nd but has the flexibility to actually do this in other gears as well. This itself is a great advantage already for quick response at higher speeds.</p>
              <p>Voith on the other hand, appears to lock-up as the bus transits from 1st to 2nd. This feature does not appear at any other times. This should explain why most Voith buses often down-shift to 1st at relatively higher speeds so that the lock-up can disconnect and the torque converter will give it the boost.</p>
              <p>Thus said, Voith buses tend to be slow on the uptake at the beginning since the initial stage has only 1 gear to work with, moreover locking-up as it transits to 2nd typically means power loss at the ending stages of the 1st gear at high rpm. So in this phase, Voith is at a disadvantage. However once it transits to 2nd and lock-up effects, things work differently. Because the engine has been running at high rpm as it transits, the turbo-boost from the engine tends to be higher and peak torque output is achieved faster. This is why Voith usually gives the feeling of steadily increasing acceleration, and most Voith buses stay at 2nd for rather short periods of time.</p>
              <p>ZF on the other hand usually locks-up early on, so while avoiding power loss at the beginning stages, is therefore not necessarily superior to Voith in the mid-range performance.</p>
              <p>It is also not necessarily true that Voiths are ultimately slower than ZFs on highways, compare a 4 speed voith MKIV and a 4 speed ZF MKIV and you'll know that the latter is actually faster. But of course! The latter is a 3 speed Voith with additional overdrive. So who says voith will always be slower?</p>
              <p>Thus said, all this rubbish comes from a biased voith fan so please feel free to correct all the wrong areas and teach me to LOVE ZF.<img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"><img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p><br> Friend....how does changing gears faster enable the bus to go
              faster? Then how do you explain times when the bus down-shifts when
              you jam the pedal?</p>
              <p>Voith is slower than ZF? I'm not sure. The best comparison I can
              get would be between the B9TLs, the ZF/Voith MKIIIs and MKIIs, the
              0405Gs. Guess what? The results tend to be ambiguous.</p>
              <p>Even talks about more gears = less stress on engine may not hold
              true at low speeds. It simply depends on how you tune the gearbox
              and the pedal. Obviously the main difference lies in the top
              speed.</p>

              <p>Funny thing as a fact, once leaving the checkpoint on the non-diverted route, all the way to Kranji MRT (cannot run on a 90 degrees turn), and then after Kranji MRT all the way to Bt Panjang, the BC can run at 60-80 km/h, with sections hitting to 90 plus if the bus can do it mechanically.</p>
