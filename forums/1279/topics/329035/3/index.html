              <p>What I recommend... Hmm...</p>
              <p>SBS 0414R if you are able to adapt to loud noise. This bus sounds as if it has a mix of ZF and W3E, and sounds exceptionally different from other ZF Mercz. The only downside to this bus is that if you stand too close to the engine, you *may* go deaf.</p>
              <p>SBS 0530M for a superb ZF transmission sound. The other time I caught it on 73, and the driver was late, he shot all the way to Toa Payoh and I could hear the loud RPM made by the accelerator from the gearbox. Nice ride.</p>
              <p>SBS 2692R has one of the best sounds from a DM3500 I ever heard. Took it on 158 few weeks back, and it was fantastic.</p>
              <p>SBS 8455U has nice aircon and powerful acceleration. Too good for such a perm route I guess... Lol.</p>
              <p>SBS 9689E for a smooth Voith gearbox. Hardly any vibrations, and the gear-changing is quick. Took it yesterday.</p>

              <p>i"ll reccomend SBS3641G now perm on 33. essentially its known as "my darling on 33"</p>
              <p>review:<br>Bus is quite smooth ride.Air-con is good. </p>
              <p>the enthusing thing about the bus is the Scania handbrake. Seldom do u hear the beep when BC pulls handbrake on a Scania bus lately. So....</p>
              <p>SBS3641G produces the beep as BC pulls handbrake. very nostalgic. <br><br>Note: SBS2888T also has a beep when handbrake is pulled.</p>
              <p>ZYX</p>
              <p> i'll reccomend SBS3899E perm on 124<br><br>Review:</p>
              <p>bus uses Zf gearbox . whats interesting is when the NBS kicks in. the pitch goes from a low tone to the usual high pitch tone of NBS very very slowly. Is very cute.<br><br><br>ZYX</p>

              <p>Un-recommended....here's one:</p>
              <p>9054L BR bus.</p>
              <p>Formerly AM 72, I never had any impression of this bus hardly having a chance to take it at all despite actually taking 72 everyday then.</p>
              <p>After a few rides on it on 88, here's the complaints:</p>
              <p>Like every ride on this bus, you'll notice excessive vibrations upon starting up. Gyrations at high speed are common amongst the L/VOs.....due to a mis-alligned (usually the tag) axle. But vibrations at low speeds even, indicates either mis-timed spark-plugs or improper feeding of fuel to the engine. My guess leans towards the former.</p>
              <p>Further evidence came from the apparent sluggishness of this bus despite the loudness of the radiator indicating the BC was trying to get it to go faster. This is consistent with torque and power leakage resulting from the guesses above.</p>
              <p>Worse was the frequent hunting between 1st and 2nd gear and frequent and too-long disconnection between the engine and axle as the lock-up clutch keeps disconnecting uphill in "desparate" attempts to provide additional torque and to prevent an engine cut-out. On level ground, the gearbox constantly hunts as torque delivered to the axle was usually insufficient. Top speed was naturally affected.</p>
              <p>Comfort-wise, the aircon is mediocre.....I felt like I was sitting in trident. The suspension was clearly decaying, which is natural...and there's of course the creakings to go with, consistent with the age of this bus. So its fair enough.</p>
              <p>But with all these together, it's quite a horror to take.</p>
