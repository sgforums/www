It is also very unpleasnat to sit in the back bench, cos the engine vibration is quite significant, and can get quite hot at times( look at what happen to 1004 early tis year ).....the list goes on, and the merits are few, except that they are a bit cleaner because they are newer..... and yes, I've forgotten to mention those fire-resistant PVC-type seat covers that can also be found on the Volgren 0405s, can cause your buttocks to catch fire after sitting on it for an hour in the afternoon heat, and they can be quite hard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do believe some companies will buy the bus. Actually I do think that Lance 245 performed better than 211, and Tibs should get rid of Lance 211 first before Lance 245.

I agree that TIBS is trying to be like SQ, as they thought that it will work for bus companies like airlines, and I personally would take the newer buses instead of the older ones, especially in times of heavy competition ( unless the new ones are Dennis LAnces ! ) MAybe TIBS is trying to take a dig at SBST for trying to keep their antiques as long as possible, even it means running head-on with the authorities. It is unlikely that LTA would prolong the life of buses from the current 15 years, as Malaysia, notably KL, had earlier announced that it would keep its fleet young below 6-7 years if possible.<br><br>Although I like the design of the ELBO, I agree that they have to go, considering their fires, and the fact that they vibrate a lot at junctions, apparently those people at ELBO didn't consider the unique wave physics of the Scania engines, and maybe that's why they had folded. Its a bit better now that TIBS had replaced the seat coverings on those Arianne seats with those common Fabric seat covers. However, its a pity that they had to go, considering their age.</div>

If you can persuade TIBS and SBST to agree to this, please take those LAnce 211s with you please, thanks a million then!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What? If SBST and TIbs exchange buses, I hope that they could transfer some Habits. Lance 211? Perhaps, no thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">.</div>

Too large an AC vent and it would spoil the appearance of the interior, and if the AC is uprated, those people sitting at the rear are going to encounter Artic while it is damn hot at the front, any creative solutions to this chicken-egg problem since the trend is going to move towards Low-floor buses?<br><br>Yes, u will rarely see lances in other areas, 'cept services from the north like 851, 852, 853, 854 and 855 as they are all based in Ang Mo kio depot. Strange, 169  has a lower % of lances than 852 since it is much nearer to the depot.</div></blockquote>Yes, I do agree. When I took SBS 7297Z on Sv. 93 even a DAF could overtake the VO. I had really wanted to get off and take the DAF to Macritchie to get home. Also, 7297Z driver kept entering bus stop bay even though there were no passengers, pissing me off.<br><br>Sv. 169 is partially controlled by Woodlands Depot, don't forget, so there is lower concentration of Lances(not that I like them but I haven't taken the Lance 211 yet!)</div>
