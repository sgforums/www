              <p>Anyway, I am quite perplexed about this forum not "being public", because I myself joined in on my own accord, and till date still do not know anyone else on this forum in real life (other than one other forum mate that rarely comes by).

              <p>As the thread starter, here are my comments on my original intention of the creation of this thread:</p>
              <p>In the past few months, I had been looking through past bus guides and read up on the development of public bus services from the 1960s till today, through SGWiki, some threads in this forum years ago and several visits to the NLB for old bus guides.</p>
              <p>This was when I realized that there were several (not all) bus services that benefited the masses and provide good alternatives to the MRT, but were unfortunately being withdrawn or shortened. Thus, I was thinking that other members in the forum would probably feel the same way for certain services, which resulted in the creation of this thread, to discuss whether <strong>certain withdrawn services that benefited the masses can be brought back in a slightly modified fashion </strong>under the BSEP (which probably will never be the case).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">While I do feel that the shortening/withdrawal of several bus services during the NEL Rationalization were probably too harsh, I know that it is impossible to revert back the services to their original forms. Thus, this thread was created with the intent to discuss what can now be done (through the introduction of new routes) to provide comparably fast alternatives to the NEL.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">It is most unfortunate that this thread had been "misused" by Path Light in complaining about the reverting of all services cut/withdrawn during the NEL Rationalization. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Moreover, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">not all</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> of the shortened/withdrawn routes during the rationalization were bad; some were good in an effort to really reduce the duplication levels and would have been too slow to compete with the NEL even if retained by LTA.</span></p>
              <p>Therefore, I don't mind if this thread is locked by the mods, since its original intent is now "ruined" by Path Light's constant harping over the past rather than constructive discussion over the above points mentioned. These issues can be better discussed in other threads like "New bus services by LTA/PTOs". Cheers.</p>

              <p>As the thread starter, here are my comments on my original
              intention of the creation of this thread:</p>
              <p>In the past few months, I had been looking through past bus
              guides and read up on the development of public bus services from
              the 1960s till today, through SGWiki, some threads in this forum
              years ago and several visits to the NLB for old bus guides.</p>
              <p>This was when I realized that there were several (not all) bus
              services that benefited the masses and provide good alternatives to
              the MRT, but were unfortunately being withdrawn or shortened. Thus,
              I was thinking that other members in the forum would probably feel
              the same way for certain services, which resulted in the creation
              of this thread, to discuss whether <strong>certain withdrawn
              services that benefited the masses can be brought back in a
              slightly modified fashion </strong>under the BSEP (which
              probably will never be the case).</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">While I do feel that the
              shortening/withdrawal of several bus services during the NEL
              Rationalization were probably too harsh, I know that it is
              impossible to revert back the services to their original forms.
              Thus, this thread was created with the intent to discuss what can
              now be done (through the introduction of new routes) to provide
              comparably fast alternatives to the NEL.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">It is most unfortunate that
              this thread had been "misused" by Path Light in complaining about
              the reverting of all services cut/withdrawn during the NEL
              Rationalization. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Moreover, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">not all</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> of the shortened/withdrawn routes
              during the rationalization were bad; some were good in an effort to
              really reduce the duplication levels and would have been too slow
              to compete with the NEL even if retained by LTA.</span></p>
              <p>Therefore, I don't mind if this thread is locked by the mods,
              since its original intent is now "ruined" by Path Light's constant
              harping over the past rather than constructive discussion over the
              above points mentioned. These issues can be better discussed in
              other threads like "New bus services by LTA/PTOs". Cheers.</p>

              <p>If only Mr Path Light knows that the SGforums is only one of the
              many platforms to play. </p>
              <p>I am quite disgusted with the other forum (skyscrapercity), that
              I asked the moderators there to block me. They probably thought
              that I am Mr Path Light. Actually, that 'Pioneerboy' is me
              (Pervertedboy/JurongWestResident/jurongresident). I have read their
              replies to my latest post, but ... well, I have come to realize
              that "online forums" are not really for discussion. I just roll my
              eyes. I do not feel like giving any more f**ks to them.</p>
              <p>If Mr Path Light is reading this, I hope he can realise that
              although this is an online forum, this is not really public. I
              guess it's only a group of people in real life, who know each other
              in real life, writing on online forums. That's why it is quite hard
              for the "outsiders" to really come in.</p>
              <p>I hope he can stop wasting his time to entertain the people
              here. Instead of writing on forums, he may want to watch drama,
              read book, ... . </p>
              <p>Autism is about not able to communicate and behave like the
              general public. Sadly, writing on forums does NOT help to improve
              communications, nor behavior. I hope people like Mr Path Light can
              understand this.</p>
              <p>To cure Autism (Communication), the real solution is to interact
              with real people, in real life. </p>
              <p>To cure Autism (Behavior), the real solution is on the
              parents of the child. I believe the reason why children cannot
              behave is because their parents never teach. But, of course, if the
              child knows this, I hope he can take the initiative HIMSELF to
              improve his own behavior, instead of putting the blame on
              parents.</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to topic.</p>
              <p>Anyway, what is the purpose of having this thread? </p>
              <p>Reaction is caused by Action.</p>
              <p>A bus route or service is changed because there is a reason for
              doing so.</p>
              <p>Usually, it is to improve bus connectivity and bus services.
              Occasionally, it is due to low demand for the bus route.</p>
              <p>With the improvements from changes in bus routes/services, I do
              not understand why some people want to revert them.</p>
              <p>I am sure when there are changes, there is compensation for
              people who are affected. Otherwise, it would be that there are
              already alternative routes for them.</p>

              <p>This is definitely not a forum of insiders. I came here just because I was researching on some random service, and to date I still do not know anyone in the forum personally (even if I know some of their names, I'm not familiar with them), and I dont like to do bus spotting at all unlike many others here. I believe there are many people like me.</p>
