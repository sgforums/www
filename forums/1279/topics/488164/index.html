              <p>This thread discusses former bus services that should have been retained/current bus services that should have retained their original routes. While this seems like just digging back into the past of bus services, it allows the collation of the lost connections that can be brought back in the form of new/amendment of existing routes (although unlikely given LTA's concept of more short distance bus services today)</p>
              <p>Here's my top picks:</p>
              <p><strong>Old sv85 (Sengkang - HarbourFront)</strong></p>
              <p>If the former sv85 between Sengkang - HarbourFront was retained, sv119 wouldn't need to be introduced just to cater mainly to students. An alternative link to the city (Orchard Rd/Little India) would also have been retained for the northeastern residents other than the NEL (even though the route was withdrawn because of NEL in the first place). It would also aid in complementing part of sv147's high demand.</p>
              <p><strong>sv989 (Choa Chu Kang - Changi Airport)</strong></p>
              <p>If the former sv989 between CCK - Changi Airport was retained, Bt Gombak residents will have an additional full day bus sv by their doorstep and enhanced connectivity to the central region of SG. Bt Batok Ind Est would also have an additional helper to complement the high demand of sv189 between Bt Batok and Bt Batok Ind Est. The main reason would also be a fast alternative from the west to the airport apart from the rail network.</p>

              <p><strong>Old sv5 (Bt Panjang - Lor 1 Geylang)</strong></p>
              <p>If the former sv5 between Bt Panjang - Lor 1 Geylang was retained, Margaret Dr would have another route to cater to the needs of the neighbourhoods along the route (apart from sv32 initially before the addition of sv122) and a direct connection to Chinatown (currently served by sv122 indirectly). Nevertheless, It is fortunate that sv970 took over part of the former sv5's route between Bt Panjang and Commonwealth.(with the exception of plying Hillview Ave/Bt Batok East Ave 2/Jln Jurong Kechil instead of Upp Bt Timah Rd/Jln Anak Bt).</p>
              <p><strong>Old sv85 (Sengkang - HarbourFront)</strong></p>
              <p>If the former sv85 between Sengkang - HarbourFront was retained, sv119 wouldn't need to be introduced just to cater mainly to students. An alternative link to the city (Orchard Rd/Little India) would also have been retained for the northeastern residents other than the NEL (even though the route was withdrawn because of NEL in the first place).

Bt Batok Ind Est would also have an additional helper to complement the high demand of sv189 between Bt Batok and Bt Batok Ind Est. The main reason would also be a fast alternative from the west to the airport apart from the rail network.</p>
              <p>I won't comment on the existing routes that were shortened during the NEL rationalization for now. Cheers. Feel free to correct any errors in the above explanations.</p>

              <p>I think its about time we write to SMRT and LTA ask them to introduce back service 989. I seriously think that 983 implemention doesn't serve a purpose with 301. 300 should seperate between 300G and 300W like during it's SBS days and 301 cna just ply 983's route, they can then introduce 983 to ply between Choa Chu Kang and Changi Airport via either Bukit Batok or Bukit Panjang.Â </p>

              <p><strong>Old TIBS Bus Service 950 (Woodlands &lt;-&gt; Shenton
              Way)</strong><br> <br> There isn't any trunk service that can connect residents from
              Woodlands to the Central Business District, despite having both
              <strong>SMRT Premium 587</strong>Â and <strong>SMRT Express
              951E</strong> which both services only operate during AM Peak and
              Peak Hours respectively. If one will want to go to the CBD, one
              needs to transfer to BLK 223 and transfer to 190 again in order to
              reach the CBD within the "shortest" time.Â <br> <br> Perhaps <strong>Premium 587</strong>Â to be converted to a
              Trunk service? Kinda impossible..</p>

              <p>148 I think it should be shortened to Shenton Way instead ofÂ being withdrawn, and converted to semi-express to reduce MRT problem and bunching problem. Or they can retain the route and 147 should just be a 2nd anchor route when NEL opened.</p>

              <p>SBS 84 is not TIBS 864. These two co-existed (and competed) along roughly the same route to the city. When SBS took over Sengkang, it was a no-brainer for them to merge them as 80, the only parts where 864 served that 84 didn't was Hougang to Sengkang (served by the new 80), Geylang Rd/Sims Ave bewteen Paya Lebar and Aljunied (not replaced), and the short distance from North Bridge Rd to Suntec (not replaced).</p>
