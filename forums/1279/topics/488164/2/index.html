              <p>This thread discusses former bus services that should have been
                  retained/current bus services that should have retained their
                  original routes. While this seems like just digging back into the
                  past of bus services, it allows the collation of the lost
                  connections that can be brought back in the form of new/amendment
                  of existing routes (although unlikely given LTA's concept of more
                  short distance bus services today)</p>
              <p>Here's my top picks:</p>
              <p><strong>Old sv5 (Bt Panjang - Lor 1 Geylang)</strong></p>
              <p>If the former sv5 between Bt Panjang - Lor 1 Geylang was
                  retained, Margaret Dr would have another route to cater to the
                  needs of the neighbourhoods along the route (apart from sv32
                  initially before the addition of sv122) and a direct connection to
                  Chinatown (currently served by sv122 indirectly). Nevertheless, It
                  is fortunate that sv970 took over part of the former sv5's route
                  between Bt Panjang and Commonwealth.(with the exception of plying
                  Hillview Ave/Bt Batok East Ave 2/Jln Jurong Kechil instead of Upp
                  Bt Timah Rd/Jln Anak Bt).</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>970 adequately covers the sectors covered by 5. Yes, it doesn't serve Margaret Drive, but it isn't that far a walk from Margaret Drive, and for most people there is no difference in terms of walking distance to Commonwealth Ave/Alexandra Rd. Furthermore, by serving Commonwealth Ave, you are improving your coverage as you are not just attracting the passengers from Margaret Drive, but also from the part of Queenstown opposite the road. Also, you have to bear in mind that when it was withdrawn, there was population decentralisation where people were moving out from areas near the city to new towns like Sengkang, Bt Panjang, Yew Tee and Jurong West Extension, so ridership most likely had fallen, replacing it with a more straightforward route near the city like 970 is probably a better choice.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I lived in Bedok North. Before the NEL rationalisation, I always walked to Bedok North Road, took svc 23 to Bendemeer Road, and changed to one of these buses to downtown: 81/82/85/97/103/106/111/133/147... After the NEL started operation in June 2003, all these services (except 133 and 147) were withdrawn/amended. I was very upset because I had concession pass for bus only and I was left with very little choice from Bendemeer Road to downtown. (E.g. Before the cut, I could take 65/85/106/111 to Orchard. After the cut, I could only take 65.) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Another service that I missed is Express 505 - Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah/Harbourfront (loop)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Express 505 travelled through Pasir Ris (Drive 1), Tampines (Avenue 7, 4, 5, 10), Bedok North Road, and then non-stop to Jalan Bukit Merah via PIE and CTE. It made a loop along Jalan Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road, Telok Blangah Road and Lower Delta Road, and travelled non-stop again to Bedok North Road. From Bedok North Road, I could reach Bukit Merah in 20 minutes. Unfortunately Express 505 was withdrawn. (If Express 505 remained, I might have taken it every day because I studied in NUS. Concession passes were not valid on Express bus, but I would still take 505 because it was really fast.)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I remembered taking 505 a few days before its withdrawal. The bus was packed all the way to the front door, and I wondered why SBST withdrew such a high-demanded service. Later SBST introduced Express 518, but 518 was not very useful for me if I travelled to NUS. By the time SBST introduced svc 5 from Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah, I was graduating from NUS, so I didn't get to enjoy the benefits of svc 5.</p>

              <p>While the idea of off peak limited-stop svcs between between housing estates and Orchard/Suntec was great, the high premium fares of $3+ deterred many pax (although student fare was $1). I think the concept would have been much more successful if the svcs charged Express fares of $2+, similar to 502, 518, 188R, 963R and Chinatown Direct.</p>
              <p>Ideally, I'd like to see some popular City Direct or CD-type bus svcs operate full day, with off peak variants serving areas like Orchard, Suntec and maybe Harbourfront. Possible svcs would be 850E (Yishun), 951E (Woodlands), 656 (Sembawang), 652 (Ang Mo Kio) and 653 (Bt Batok). If 502 and 518 are popular despite their Express fares, I think some of the City Direct svcs could be similarly successful, especially for outlying housing estates further from the city.</p>

              501 back. 82 and 83 back to Shenton Way and Newbridge Rd.
              502 no need as I want 501 back and they will just duplicate each other and at the same time, 502 would be too long.
