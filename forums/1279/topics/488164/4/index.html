              <p>Hi mr pathlight, whatever over is over. The buses from west to northeast has been trimmed more than a decade ago. They are not going to come back. Are you serious when you mean Sbs 82 ends at jurong east. They already reduce it to serangoon central only and you still think they will extend all the way to jurong east???</p>
              <p>For those lost services at northeast area, the authorities have implemented circle line MRT to compensate back. The circle line is very important for the northeast people to go west and east fast. We have a better alternative and we also will have new bus services coming up. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Honestly, I feel that the Northeast does need more services towards the city. But of course not all the way to the east like what Path Light suggested.</p>
              <p>There were really way too many services shortened or withdrawn during NEL Rationalisation. Now with Sengkang and Punggol towns developing rapidly and NEL getting more and more crowded, it's time to introduce more services for them to travel to the city, as an alternative to MRT.</p>
              <p>It's true that MRT offers the fastest journey, but not necessarily the best. And just adding trains to NEL is not a solution. I don't see a reason why we shouldn't introduce express services from Punggol and Sengkang to the city, being full-day express services or peak-hour services. If services like 513 and 850E can become hot cakes even with MRT in place, such a service for Punggol will definitely be extremely popular. Don't forget that Punggol is now the only town (with a bus interchange) with NO services to CBD.</p>
              <p>Normal trunk services are also not totally irrational. I do feel that the Northeast side (including Serangoon and Hougang) lacks something in the transport network... Maybe it's due to the mass truncation of services plying the northeast corridor, especially Serangoon Rd area. And regarding long services, if cross-island services such as (some terrible examples) 5, 14, 51 are doing okay (although their frequencies can be terrible), it may not be necessarily bad to have some longer services in the northeast - but not crucial.</p>
              <p>Of course, I'm not supporting Path Light who's just crazily calling for all services to be extended back to where they were, without any considerations. I also know that my suggestions are unlikely to come true due to LTA's preferences.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, don't forget that there is circle line which negates the need for long distance bus services. The truncation of the bus services to Northeast is being off settled by circle line implementation. With circle line, many northeast residents do rejoice. The authorities did introduce peak hour express services for sengkang residents. Soon another peak hour service will come to Punggol. But the way I see it, they are just scant consolations.</p>
              <p>Who says adding trains to NEL is not a solution? It is one of the best solutions. The capacity will be largely boosted by arrival of 6 to 7 new trains for NEL. The frequency is currently not that great. This plan has already been endorsed long time ago and status is just waiting for the trains. You need large capacity trains to move people out of Northeast fast. Buses cannot take up this role. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, I agree. Punggol to sembawang is coming up. As for those Punggol to CBD and other areas, I suggest if it is only for peak hours, the authorities can save it up. If it is a normal daily service, I suggest they make certain parts of the routes express. Feedback I received is that if the journey is going to be a stop by stop route, most people staying in northeast Punggol will still take MRT. The journey is unbearable for such long journeys. Sometimes people will rather give up going to other places or change destinations on weekends if they have to travel by long distance bus. They will rather hop on to MRT. For those who live in these super outskirts area, they will understand. I have on occasions heard that they rather take the cab. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr AJQZC, I agree. Punggol to sembawang is coming up. As for
              those Punggol to CBD and other areas, <strong>I suggest if it is only for
              peak hours, the authorities can save it up.</strong> If it is a normal daily
              service, I suggest they make certain parts of the routes express.
              Feedback I received is that if the journey is going to be a stop by
              stop route, most people staying in northeast Punggol will still
              take MRT. The journey is unbearable for such long journeys.
              Sometimes people will rather give up going to other places or
              change destinations on weekends if they have to travel by long
              distance bus. They will rather hop on to MRT. For those who live in
              these super outskirts area, they will understand. I have on
              occasions heard that they rather take the cab. Cheers.
              Thanks. </p>

              <p>The point that I bold... Maybe the service should be something like Svc 70/70M or like Svc 128 only operate during peak hours only...</p>
              <p>Maybe major bus stops can lorhx from Punggol to Sengkang MRT, Buangkok MRT, Hougang MRT, Kovan MRT then up the flyover towards City?</p>
