              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by autumncs:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I missed all the bus services
              that were withdrawn/amended due to the North-East Line
              rationalisation in 2003.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I lived in Bedok North.
              Before the NEL rationalisation, I always walked to Bedok North
              Road, took svc 23 to Bendemeer Road, and changed to one of these
              buses to downtown: 81/82/85/97/103/106/111/133/147... After the NEL
              started operation in June 2003, all these services (except 133 and
              147) were withdrawn/amended. I was very upset because I had
              concession pass for bus only and I was left with very little choice
              from Bendemeer Road to downtown. (E.g. Before the cut, I could take
              65/85/106/111 to Orchard. After the cut, I could only take
              65.) </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Another service that I
              missed is Express 505 - Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah/Harbourfront
              (loop)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Express 505 travelled
              through Pasir Ris (Drive 1), Tampines (Avenue 7, 4, 5, 10), Bedok
              North Road, and then non-stop to Jalan Bukit Merah via PIE and CTE.
              It made a loop along Jalan Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road, Telok
              Blangah Road and Lower Delta Road, and travelled non-stop again to
              Bedok North Road. From Bedok North Road, I could reach Bukit Merah
              in 20 minutes. Unfortunately Express 505 was withdrawn. (If Express
              505 remained, I might have taken it every day because I studied in
              NUS. Concession passes were not valid on Express bus, but I would
              still take 505 because it was really fast.)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I remembered taking 505
              a few days before its withdrawal. The bus was packed all the way to
              the front door, and I wondered why SBST withdrew such a
              high-demanded service. Later SBST introduced Express 518, but 518
              was not very useful for me if I travelled to NUS. By the time SBST
              introduced svc 5 from Pasir Ris to Bukit Merah, I was graduating
              from NUS, so I didn't get to enjoy the benefits of svc 5.</p>

              <p>Agree with most of your points, but you're a bit too extreme here... Even with MRT in place, there are still more bus trips made than MRT trips every day (check out my reply in Loading Levels thread). And even with MRT offering faster connections, there are people who don't like squeezing on MRT or making tedious transfers (such as walking through the long transfer linkways at Serangoon or Outram Park). That's why there are Premium services, and trunk services running parallel to MRT yet still getting packed to the door (e.g. 147).</p>

              <p>Or 159 and change to 157. When Service 502 was extended, it should squeeze in Service 163's berth. Service 501 would most likely replace Service 502's route which is:<br>Soon Lee Bus Park &gt; Shenton Way</p>
