            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This is not a complain thread, but I would like to share the complain letter that I have mailed to SMRT regarding this. Details in the letter.<br><blockquote><br>Dear personnel in charge,<br>I would like to lodge complain against the driver of service 61, shift 61PM18, vehicle number TIB1152X. The trip was on Sunday, 5th November, 2006.<br>I boarded the bus opposite Sri Mariamman temple at South Bridge Road, at 2308hrs. The driver drove slowly, which I was not surprised at first, as he might be ahead of time. However, as the bus was traveling along Alexandra Road, before Alexandra Hospital, the speed dropped to around 20km/h, with the bus making a sickening vibrating sound. I then felt that something was wrong.<br>When the bus left the stop outside Alexandra Hospital, I approached the driver and asked him if there was anything wrong with the bus, and why he was driving so slowly. He replied rather curtly that he was following the timetable, and said loudly to me to sit down, without any hint of apology. As the trip progressed on, other commuters felt that the bus was moving really too slow. A few went up front to ask, but was replied with the same tone that he was only following the timetable.<br>As the bus reached Holland Road, the slow speed was even apparent to more commuters, and another bus, TIB426M which the driver claimed was running on the last shift, overtook us at the junction of Holland Road and Sixth Avenue (the last bus departing from Eunos Interchange was 2330hrs, and the time TIB426M overtook us was 2349hrs, how would the bus have covered 32 stages in 19 minutes?). I asked him again about his time, and the fact that another bus overtook was a serious breach to the companyÂ’s regulations. He rudely replied that he is following the timetable, and that he has no wrong in this. When the bus stopped to take on passengers, I saw on the timetable that the bus was to reach Bukit Batok Interchange at 2355hrs, and by then the bus was at the junction of Ulu Pandan Road and Clementi Road, the time was already 2357hrs, 2 minutes behind scheduled time and another 15 minutes away from the destination.<br>I said to the driver that he was behind time, then did he looked at the timetable and mumbled to himself. I asked him politely why was he keeping the commuters in the dark, with apparent knowledge that the trip was behind schedule, he said that the company took him 6 minutes of his rest time, and that he was just trying to cover for lost time (at the expense of the commutersÂ’ time!). And he kept insisting, in a loud tone, that I sit down. But with the driver behind time, plus many other commuters on the bus was already furious about this delay, I could not just sit down and do nothing. I once again asked him why he is driving slowly despite being behind time, he shouted at me, saying again that the company took his rest time, so he had to drive slowly to cover up, and that the company charges two dollars per one minute of early arrival to the destination, and while this penalty is in force, no penalties are present for drivers who were late! He would simply lose his rest time, but that does not mean that he or any driver could be late, as these are directly in conflict with the commutersÂ’ time; one minute lost is one minute of loss, no doubt in that!<br>After hearing his rude explanation, I felt that I could not just continue on the trip, and alighted at Blk 288C, Bukit Batok East Avenue 6, at 0009hrs, at that time the bus was 14 minutes behind schedule. As I alighted, the driver shouted out that I was merely threatening to complain, that he would not give any Â“heckÂ” care to this.<br>I would like the company to hold an investigation into this serious case of driver impoliteness, obstructive driving, delay despite clear acknowledgement of the timetable and telling lies to commuters. This driver made the commuters very frustrated and furious due to the delay, and several of them alighted early from the bus because of this reason. The explanation that there would not be any penalty to drivers who arrive late was unreasonable to me; drivers can just drive slowly, knowing that he would sacrifice his rest time, just for the comfort of driving slowly on the road? Commuters are at the loss here, while we pay the fares, the drivers did not improve their standards and keep commuters from knowing any truth!<br>Hence this incident made me feel disgusted, both at the fallacy of the driverÂ’s lies and the delay, even minutes, to the commuters.<br>I would hope that the company can reply to me as soon as possible regarding this case and measures done to the driver. My email is terence767400@hotmail.com<br>Thank you.<br></blockquote></div>

But think again. The timesheet is something for the drivers. Not the passengers. Like what carbikebus had said. A successful complaint could be made with relevant informations like how long the journey took and the bus number and not forgetting the time you board and alight. By typing the Shift Code and all that might get the driver in trouble for all you know. And also, the driver got the right NOT to tell you whether the bus is early or late. Afterall, he is not suppose to let you know.</div>

But such sub-standard services, don't you think something is amiss? A driver should not shout at his customers, and should explain properly, even these are so-called 'corporate secrets'.

When I told others about this, many agreed. How about this then?<br>If buses anyhow overtake each other, then we won't be enjoying service brought by the company, but by some other selfish drivers!<br>I have thought through well, I don't need someone else to tell me this. I ask this question once again, are you a primary/secondary school student? If you are some big shot adult, then I can consider to respect you, but I never respect people who are younger than me, by the rule of the thumb. Many so called bus fans are just children, how many forumnites have done well here? How many have made outings successful? Just plain talk, flame and disrespect!<br>I haven't showed you what I know and do, so please, mind you words!</div></blockquote>Goodness me,<br><br>Heh, I'm not some Secondary school student or younger but I do respect people younger than my age, not like some person here who shows off his "wonderful" bus knowledge to the drivers and bus company and younger forumnites, do you know there is this thing called discretion? I wouldn't complain against a driver who is late, although I loathe them, since they don't get their break, then thats their problem. If you face such a problem, then do what I do, alight and take another bus.<br><br>Ah you think I'm a kid? I'd love to be one if you force me to use my sarcasitc side.<br><br>How about photographing a bus in a depot through the holes in the fence, that isn't very right, maybe you had breached some SBS Transit rule or even the law.<br><br>I did not expect a polytechnic student to behave like a kid, compalining about small matters. I urge you to take things in stride.<br><br>Maybe you should use your comments on yourself.</div>
