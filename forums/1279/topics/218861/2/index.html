Shouldnt the bus services to be made to such an extent that it can compete with travel times of trains and with the benefit of point to point transport while paying much lesser cost than traveling by a car? Quote: "If u plan to fail, u will fail", in this case, If they plan to be slow, they surely will be slower.<br><br>Also, threadstarter did say the captain unknowingly misread the timetable. This could simply be a feedback to tell SMRT to enlarge the font size of their timetable so drivers can read it properly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is the most ridiculous thread I've read. Mr Jetabout simply had a frustating experience on board a bus and got more infuriated when he got ticked off by the driver. Hence, he produced this so called 'complaint' letter filled with rage without  much thought behind it, in the hope of 'getting back', and created a big hoo haa, or should I say 'kao pei, kao bu", to get people to support him. Who are you to complain wheteher the BC is driving fast or slow? The driver has a schedule to keep. He can't just drive ahead of schedule and risk getting into trouble with his superiors just to satisfy you. Please, as bus enthusiasts we should be the ones who are better informed about the workings of the BC/SC. As such, we should be the ones who are more understanding, more tolerant, and if possible, inform members of the public why the BC/SL is behaving that way. I'm sorry if the incident caused you to be late, but if you ask me, it was just a case of being in the wrong bus, at the wrong time. Its ironic to catch a slow moving bus when you are already late but that is how the world goes.</div>
