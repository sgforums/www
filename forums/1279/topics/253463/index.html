            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Snag over Rapid KL bus facilities for the disabled</strong><br>Tuesday April 24, 2007<br>By CHRISTINA LOW<br>Photos by UU BAN<br>TheStar<br><br>MORE than 30 individuals from various NGO's ga-thered at the Bangsar LRT station recently to try out the new facilities for the disabled provided by Rapid KL.<br><br>Â“We were so excited when we were told that facilities for the disabled would be available on public buses as it would definitely help us to get about,Â” said K. Segaran, a member of the Independent Living and Training Centre.<br><br>The 20-year-old said with such facilities available, he did not have to rely on taxis or friends to move about.<br><br><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/archives/2007/4/24/central/03bus.jpg"><br><br><span class="small">Troublesome: The bus is parked close to the curb to enable the disabled passengers to get on board.</span><br><br>However, the group was a little disappointed when some flaws in the facilities became apparent.<br><br>Â“Every time the bus stops, it has to be parked near the road curb to enable the driver to lift and connect the ramp to the curb. Only then can those using wheelchairs come down.<br><br>In other countries, the bus is designed to match the curb to make it easy for those using wheelchairs and mothers using prambulators for their babies to get in and out of the bus.<br><br>Â“This is a hassle as each time the driver has to get down and assist us.<br><br>Â“Furthermore, the bus not only caters to the disabled but also able passengers,Â” said Malaysian Animal-Assisted Therapy for the Disabled and Elderly Association (PETPOSITIVE) president Anthony Thanasayan.<br><br>Thanasayan said one solution would be using a <strong>hydraulic lift</strong>.<br><br>Â“Hydraulic lifts have been used in buses for many years in other countries. We should follow suit,'' he said.<br><br>Another shortcoming is the narrow passageway on the buses. Those using a bigger wheelchair would find it difficult to move in and out.<br><br>The group said they did not want to rely on others to move about and wanted facilities that would help them lead an independent life.<br><br>Â“We are thought to be independent but with such obstacles, it is difficult,'' said Thanasayan.<br><br>He said Rapid KL should get ideas and feedback from the disabled as different individuals had different needs.<br><br>Support Group Society for the Blind of Malaysia (Supporteam) secretary Captain Abdul Karim Stuart Russel said the bus company should also announce each stop for the benefit of the blind.<br><br>He said the names of the stops should also be announced.<br><br>Also, he said the empty space at the front part of the bus for wheelchairs should be fitted with folding chairs for the able-bodied to use.<br><br>Â“The empty space is wasted when no wheelchair users are on board,Â” said Abdul Karim.<br><br>When contacted, Rapid KL's senior manager of corporate communications division Katherine Chew said the company had met up with members from the Barrier-Free Environment and Accessible Transport Group (BEAT) to understand and discuss the facilities that the bus company should provide for its customers before finalising details.<br><br>Â“We even tested the service with them and they seemed happy with it,Â” said Chew.<br><br><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/archives/2007/4/24/central/02rapid.jpg"><br><span class="small">A little help: Rapid KL bus driver Pahamib Sarahing<br>helping V. Munusamy alight from the bus.</span><br><br>Â“Our drivers will be trained to assist the disabled passengers, deaf and also the blind when they board the bus,Â” she said.<br><br>At present there are buses operating on the trunk and city routes for able bodied passengers as well as the disabled.<br><br>Chew said the disabled should begin using the services only after the launch in June as all bus drivers would have been properly trained by then.</div>

Malaysia do have a fair share of Volvo buses, the most common is the B7R. The B10M is rare and I was quite surprised to see a B10M express bus (Malaysian rego) on the highway once, as I was making my way to Sepang for the Malaysian GP. Volvo buses are not new either. In the past, South Johore (now Transitlink JB) used to run Volvo B6FA buses. If you're lucky, you might even find one Volvo B6FA 'Bas Sekolah' or 'Bas Pekerja'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the interior photo, these buses seem to have many shortcomings, which I will try to describe.<br><br>1. There seems to be a lack of staunchions in the front (low-floor) section for people to hold on to.  This will lead to people falling over in the event of sharp acceleration or braking.<br><br>2. The doors are too narrow, restricting passenger flow as well as making it impossible for larger wheelchairs and motorscooters to board.<br><br>3. The wheelchair ramp is even narrower.<br><br>4. There seems to be no seating in the front section.  Better planning of the interior is needed.<br><br>5. The driver seems to have minimal, if any protection.  A full wrap-around driver's cab is adviseable as it would make the driver's job much safer.<br><br>Regards,<br>Dave</div>

Perhaps the designer thinks that stanchions might be an obstruction to the wheelchair users?</div>
