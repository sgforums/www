              <p>Oh yeah, it did swap with 1726J from BN 15 for 2 weeks or so.Then 359 took back 858T &amp; 1726J went back to 15 again. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"> But 2 weeks out of 359 but otherwise remained on 359 is stil quite long right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

Then 1972P went in from BN SP to 21 to replace 2627E. 2625K 2629A from that same period of perm 21 all went elsewhere also now.</p>
