              <p>so u can compare SIN n HK how different on the amount and different kind model....</p>
              <p>also becuz hk the road environment so v can introduce to much full size SDs , according this List u can c v got alot of medium Size SDs</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but honestly , @ that that two times i went to SIN</p>
              <p>i've got a conclusion</p>
              <p>'' SINGAPORE bus servive still get a improvement interspace ''</p>
              <p> but i'm not deprecate on these things , just a opinion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how come the buses always full? still using the SDs with a not high frequency</p>
              <p>how come intorduce The K230UB this cheap n third-rate chassis be the main fleet , the last platoon of the seat is too high (totally 4-5 stepsfrom the exit) The best of a city bus chassis is the SLF bus</p>
              <p>how come the name call express service just via so little highway oe expressway ? yr mane is express , but via too much city/town area , not really express (in my opinion , i've take 502 n 518 as before)</p>
              <p>the fast foward svc is the most stupid measure</p>
              <p>The regular departure after a little bit traffic jam it might be hit the fast foward departure  , so stupid @@</p>
              <p><strong>the buses of SBS exterior some part were broke and sunken still in svc also the engine sound is noisy , especially the O405 and VO2X</strong></p>
              <p>the interior of the buses can using the warmer light ,</p>
              <p>SBS / SMRT can operate some point to point Expressway Bus service</p>
              <p>it's really attractive for the Office guy @ am/pm peak hr.s</p>
              <p>the Expressway Bus service got a long history in HK already</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Wow not bad leh.hk got so many MAN SDs in addition to the MAN DDs also.Really cool man.I really like MAN buses and i hope to see SBST buying them since the MAN 18.240 demo is with them now.But i think it will be a really long time after we can see more of them here in Singapore.<br><br>Yeah the K230s rear is damn pathetic.I myself and many other ppl as well have always bumped our head in the ceiling when we stand up after sitting in the last row of seats.Very irritating sia....<br><br>U cant expect much of the SBST Merc O405s and the VO2X all alr cuz they are old and are almost reaching their end of their lifespans alr.<br><br>And if u dunno,SBS bought 700 Merc O405s from 1990-1991.Now there are only ard 290 of them left cuz the rest of them have been scrapped earlier alr.The standard lifespan is 19 years here.But some of this Merc O405s were scrapped at ard 17 years alr without an extension :(<br><br>TIBS was formed later in 1982.Then ard 2003 or 2004 like that,it became SMRT.Thats why the SMRT buses look better and newer in the exterior as bascially the whole fleet is all new buses with the exception of the Nissan Diesels and the Scania ELBOs.Haha.</p>

              <p><br>Well, 33xx have rear ramp because of its shorter front overhang instead of its height. On my similar page discribing 33xx, you will find that the company is challenging the law regarding the height.</p>
              <p>All those DM buses are for airport service. But note that most of these powered ramps have become out of order and the driver had to move the wheelchair to the bus. On top of that, many CTB buses do not have ramp installed. e.g. 1501-1580, the rest of 2101-2301?... when they were purchased new. but they do have wheelchair spaces. It is unacceptable in terms of wheelchair access and occupational health and safety.</p>

              <p>latest new , 11/12  11:21</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>KMB ADL E400 already also pass the tilt test @these few days</p>
              <p>and waiting for the GOV. TD handover the license to KMB,</p>
              <p>but honestly , it will not on svc yet , becuz KMB will do alot of road test , or let some driver to get some training first , i hope it can entering svc before mid-Jan.....alot of hk bus fans fourm are stll guessing wt route will kmb put it , we thought that KMB want to show off the new vehicle so will put on the lower capacity cross habour route , for example maybe 109 , 103 ....</p>
              <p>becuz the E400 can't carry too much passengers , also it can only carry 90 passengers , so can't operate on some high capacity route</p>
              <p>this responsibility must handover to the B9TL , E500 , K310UD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anotherside, CTB ADL E400 already @ CTB main depot , (Chai Wan Depot) , CTB didn't remove the <strong>bull bar , becuz the E400 will run the </strong></p>
              <p>stanley routes(unconfirm) , wtever it will run the express route 6X , 260 or traditional route 6,6A the road is really narrow and the tree is ververy easily hit the bus , so they didn't remove the bullbar , but honestly , we guess CTB one entering svc faster than KMB .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>a bamboo telegraph from a staff from KMB , The Scania K310UD demonstrator ASU1 and ASU2 will withdrawn soon , although a new batch of Scania Buses arrived ( K230UB and K230UB ) , the main reason is KMB dissatisfied of ASU1 and ASU2 , KMB request Scania to Build another 2 unit for them to replace the ASU1 and ASU2 .</p>
              <p>in nowadays The ASU1 is on a express route 69X , ASU2 is on the traditional cross habour route 104 </p>
              <p>(so if u feel interest on them , shoot them!!=] )</p>
              <p>the new batch of K310UD although some of them the interior were dusty already , but they still not get the license , some of them still parking on the outdoor carpark .</p>

              <p>Wait. Please rephrase it. Tsing Ma Bridge or we call it Lantau Link has no tunnels. It only has lower levels for the MTR tracks(there's 4 tracks, two for tung chung line and two for the airport express), 4(2+2) vehicular lanes. It has no tunnels. It's just the lower level of the bridge itself only. </p>
              <p>Somehow the vehicular lanes are there for a purpose. More like to facilitate breakdown train stocks on the tracks. </p>

              <p><br>Our A21 towards Airport on 18 Dec (2130 / HT6075, took at about 4pm) also took the lower deck of the Lantau Link, no upper deck views of the bridge =(  As we were approaching the bridge the road signs said both upper and lower decks were open, and I suppose the bus captains have been instructed to take lower deck in such cases.</p>
              <p>Seems that the inclement (and much colder) weather that set in from Wednesday onwards forced the opening of the lower deck as a precautionary measure (when winds are strong or a typhoon is on approach, the surface of the bridge will be closed and all vehicles diverted to the sheltered lower deck). </p>

              <p>Correction:</p>
              <p>The standard lifespan is 17 years here, not 19. The O405s are extended 2 years more, beyond the 17 years lifespan.</p>
              <p>And no point having better looking buses when SMRT maintainance is like totally crap.</p>

              <p>Correction:</p>
              <p>The standard lifespan is 17 years here, not 19. The O405s are extended 2 years more, beyond the 17 years lifespan.</p>
