              <p>HK bus fares are different from SG.<br>Their fare is more or less fixed for most routes[except tunnel routes]<br>So you board and pay a fix fare...<br>Tunnel routes would be cheaper once it has passed the segment...<br>Furthermore, there is only one "validator" when you board the bus, the BC is very alert and scans everyone who boards[most HKers will not cheat by nt tapping their octopus card]<br>KMB, NWFB, CTB BCs normally open one side of their entrance doors for boarding so ev1 has to queue to tap...</p>

              <p>a relevant question if u r taking the LRT though.</p>
              <p>LRT is based on your own honesty in tapping in and out on the readers at the LRT stations. can buy ticket. Paper issued. For single trips only.</p>
              <p>They got conductors carrying out checks on LRT trains but I've never seen one before.</p>
              <p>Din know H1/H2 and the 15C issued tickets. maybe i shd try pay in cash. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note there is no "not owning a Octopus Card" penalty . all fares are same in cash/card.</p>

              The Chief Executive Officer of the Octopus Card company, Prudence Chan, has rejected accusations by lawmakers that she was lying when she denied selling the personal data of 1.9 million cardholders to third parties. Ms Chan had said earlier that the company had not sold any personal information of cardholders to anyone. But she later backtracked and admitted the company had earned HK$44 million by selling the data. Ms Chan insisted the company had adopted what she called a wrong definition of the word "selling".
              <p>The Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council's Security Panel, Democrat James To, said he expects his colleagues to consider invoking special powers to investigate the Octopus Card company as the whole picture hasn't yet come out. He said the public would have a much clearer picture if the Legislative Council proceeds with an investigation, coupled with the results from three ongoing probes launched by the Privacy Commissioner, the Monetary Authority, and the company itself</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, said the government was very concerned about the controversy surrounding the Octopus Card company. Mr Tsang, who's in Sichuan to oversee earthquake reconstruction work funded by Hong Kong, said he'd contacted the Privacy Commissioner and hoped the special hearing he's conducting would be able to find out what happened, and prevent a similar incident from happening again. </p>

Speaking after a special board meeting of the MTRC, which is a majority shareholder of the card company, Mr Chien acknowledged the public's disappointment over company's selling of personal data of about two million cardholders to third parties for HK$44 million. He also said whether the Chief Executive Officer of the Octopus Card Company, Prudence Chan, should stay on was a matter for her company's board to decide.
              <p>Ms Chan had come under heavy criticism for initially denying that the Octopus Card Company had sold its clients' personal data, only to reveal later that it had done so and earned the $44 million.</p>
              <p>Earlier, the Privacy Commissioner, Roderick Woo, made a series of initial recommendations regarding the company's collection of personal data. He said it shouldn't require customers to give excessive personal information to join its rewards schemes. Mr Woo said the Commission would issue a final report at a later date. </p>

But according the a global human resources consultant, Mercer, the territory ranks 71st in terms of quality of life for residents.
              <p>Speaking on RTHK's "Letter to Hong Kong", Ms Eu said part of the reason for the disparity was the territory's dirty air. She said buses were a major polluter and the government should move faster to tackle the problem.</p>

But she said that even if a test run was successful, with the government's "usual time lag", it would be 2015 before the scheme could be fully implemented. </p>

A spokesman for the union, Chung Chung-fai, said management would meet them again before the weekend. He said the drivers would not accept anything less than a 2.2 percent increase </td>

              The Board of the Octopus card company has accepted the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer, Prudence Chan, following a public outcry over the company's selling of cardholders information to third parties for HK$44 million. But Ms Chan will stay on for another six months to aid various investigations and reviews into the privacy row. She'll be replaced by David Tang from Octopus' majority shareholder - the Mass Transit Railway Corporation - on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is found.
              <p>The Chairman of the Octopus card company, Lincoln Leung, apologised for the anxiety the firm has caused its cardholders and pledged to review all the data it currently holds on them. Mr Leung also said the company will donate the HK$44 million, which it made from selling cardholders data, to the Community Chest of Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the day, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, K.C. Chan, demanded the Octopus card company to take immediate steps to deal with its "management and corporate governance" issues. </p>

But New World First Bus said it was sticking to its 1.8 percent offer. The Secretary-General of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Lee Cheuk-yan, said he thought 2.2 percent was a very humble demand.</p>

Government chief transport officer Michael Ng said other public transport operators have been asked to strengthen services to minimise the impact of the action.
