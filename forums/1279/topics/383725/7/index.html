              I find taking the Star Ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to HK Island to be the best option and is rather cost effective. Fares for buses &amp; MTR crossing over to HK Island are quite expensive. MTR is fast but overcrowded. Buses got stuck along the road along Cross Harbour Tunnel.

              Tunnel will be going up this Sunday. The charges for private cars,

              to pay HK$1 more. But double-decker buses will have to pay an

              company to consider public affordability and acceptance before
              hiking the tolls. A spokesman for the Coalition to Monitor Public
              Transport and Utilities, Richard Choi, said it was all the

              <td class="style13">Hong Kong's tram operator has defended its decision to apply for a 25 percent increase in fares saying it needs the money to improve services as well as to enhance safety and reliability. This came as the company faces declining passenger numbers. It said without the fare increase, it would start to incur losses from next year. The company has applied to raise fares by HK$0.50 to HK$2.50 for adults, starting in November. Children will have to pay HK$0.30 cents more - a total of HK$1.30. Senior citizens will be spared for a year after which a HK$0.10 increase will be imposed. The company's Managing Director, Bruno Charrade, said trams would remain Hong Kong's cheapest transport mode even after the fare increase.
              <p>But a spokesman for the Coalition to Monitor Public Transport and Utilities, Richard Tsoi, said it's not the right time to hike tram fares. He warned such a move could lead to similar increases by other transport operators. </p>
