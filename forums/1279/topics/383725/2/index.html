              <p>hi everybody! =] a new member form HK</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ya , we have got alot of E500 in hkof different bus companies already , KMB, CTB , NWFB , Long Win , MTR Feeder Bus Group(E).or even the CLP power staff bus also using the E500 , honestly the HK bus Fans feel very boring of any E500 , very very boring!!!</p>
              <p> i've counted @ before The Enviro500 Trident fleet in HK , totally 393</p>
              <p>the Enviro500 body of Volvo B9TL , totally 96</p>
              <p> that's meaning totally 489 E500 in HK (include a batch of NWFB 11.3 M n most common 12 M version)</p>
              <p> the First E500 introduced from KMB in 2003  , From The standard Euro 3 emission until now the KMB ATEU1 is using the Euro5 emission ISLe engine , also the exterior got 3 version already  , so we feel very boring =0=</p>
              <p> Luckily in the late of 2007 , MTRC had order a new batch 11 of ADL E200 Dart 11.3 M for the MTR Feeder Bus Group(W) to replaced the 17 years Mitsubishi MK117J , all of them had arrived in the 2008</p>
              <p> this action let us feel excitant because we can see more ADL product in HK....not just only The E500 again , Also can continue</p>
              <p>the legend product in HK ----- The ADL/Dennis Dart series ,</p>
              <p>from 1990 introduced the first dennis Dart with traditional carlyle</p>
              <p>body until to 1996 the first Dart SLF in HK and the dual dr of Dart SLF , and The Spuer Pointer Dart until now the E200 Dart</p>
              <p> also becuz the Dart series , we can saw alot of different The Britain bosy manufacturer , for example the Marshall , NC , Carlyle , the most famous Plaxton Pointer</p>
              <p> so , untill the late of 2008 v heard that KMB n CTB will introduce the E400 , Honestly i feel very very excited of this news , because v can c a British style product and famous British local product in HK again , although the HK and UK version got a little bit different</p>
              <p> the B7RLE , honestly it's looks quite great , it just only got of them arrived in November ,  but after The E400 demos arrived  , evryone was just focusing on the E400 n ignore the MCV B7RLE already &gt;&lt;''</p>
              <p> in the following days , The full batch of B7RLE will be arrive , the E400 will entering service very soon ,  also there will got a new batch Of Wright Gemini MK2 body 3-axle Volvo B9TL arrive in 2010.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> ** it might be got some grammatical mistakes , hope all of the members excusal me</p>

              <p>If you think E500s in HK are very common and boring, wait till u see the K230UBs in SG!

              <p>ya i know =] , i hv been to SG for two times , also i've shooted alot of SBS n SMRT vehicles , firstly i'm not deprecate SG's buses , but honestly its really boring in sg , O405 , B10M , K230 running whole island ...... when i back to hk , i feel apprecate that v hv got alot of buses already.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>recently , i've heard that SMRT purchase 66 unit of M-Benz Citaro Rigid , i really jealous about that , HK the new SD was just only the ADL E200 , MAN 12.240 , NL273R , Volvo B7RLE , Scania K230UB  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also i jealous SG got alot of Articulated M-benz O405 ,</p>
              <p>but HK The RD is too narrow so v can't introduce the Articulated Bus</p>
              <p>but reversely to look it's also becuz HK got alot of different kind rd</p>
              <p>so v need to using different of short buses.....</p>

              <p>Do a survey of no. of bus types in 1989 and 2009 and you'll know that the bus types in both HK and SG decreased a lot and thus making you guys feel bored.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, SG has a rule to withdraw all buses reaching 20 years (both private and public), so it is impossible to find older buses in SG.</p>
              <p>Referring to a view for "nice nice buses in HK", I feel that HK definitely have better d/d buses. But in terms of s/d, there is not much difference, except HK is purchasing B7RLE but SG is introducing Citaro! For cross border ones, SG probably wins (except B10Ms / CBC1632...).</p>
              <p>I like the big variety and mixture of public and private buses in different cities, including Macau.</p>

              <p>also i jealous SG got alot of Articulated M-benz O405 ,</p>
              <p>but HK The RD is too narrow so v can't introduce the Articulated Bus</p>
              <p>but reversely to look it's also becuz HK got alot of different kind rd</p>
              <p>so v need to using different of short buses.....</p>

              <p>Yeah.Having 489 units of a same model is still very ok compared to having 900 same looking Gemilang K230s here.And we still dunno wat is the bodywork the upcoming 200 Scanias are using.If they are using Gemilang again,thats it.We will have 1100 same looking K230s here.Alr bus fans here are dying of boredom staring at 900 K230s every single day everywhere.Imagine how much more worse it will be having to look at 1100 K230s every single day.<br><br>Wow MAN SDs are really cool man.Here there is only the demo in SBST.Its the MAN 18.240 HOCL-NL.I am hoping that they will buy more of it one day but i think that wont be now since they have bought the 200 Scanias and 150 Wright B9s now.This 350 buses are supposed to arrive next year.<br><br>Yeah its really a huge surprise for us bus fans here that SMRT has bought Citaros.We seriously didnt expect them to be in Singapore so soon but nevertheless its still a pleasant surprise and a dream come true for us.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""><br><br>Actually SMRT is the operator here that buys the most nice nice buses most of the time.Haha.Like the Mercedez Benz O405G Hispano Habit Bendies which were designed from the same company as ferrari and so on.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=""><br><br>Haha yeah thats one thing i like about Singapore.The mixtures of Bendies and DDs here.Like that got all 3 varieties and more nicer rather than all DDs and SDs only.Very boring like that.Haha.</p>

              <p>so u can compare SIN n HK how different on the amount and different kind model....</p>
              <p>also becuz hk the road environment so v can introduce to much full size SDs , according this List u can c v got alot of medium Size SDs</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>but honestly , @ that that two times i went to SIN</p>

              <p> but i'm not deprecate on these things , just a opinion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>how come the buses always full? still using the SDs with a not high frequency</p>
              <p>how come intorduce The K230UB this cheap n third-rate chassis be the main fleet , the last platoon of the seat is too high (totally 4-5 stepsfrom the exit) The best of a city bus chassis is the SLF bus</p>
              <p>how come the name call express service just via so little highway oe expressway ? yr mane is express , but via too much city/town area , not really express (in my opinion , i've take 502 n 518 as before)</p>
              <p>the fast foward svc is the most stupid measure</p>
              <p>The regular departure after a little bit traffic jam it might be hit the fast foward departure  , so stupid @@</p>
              <p>the buses of SBS exterior some part were broke and sunken still in svc also the engine sound is noisy , especially the O405 and VO2X</p>
              <p>the interior of the buses can using the warmer light ,</p>
              <p>SBS / SMRT can operate some point to point Expressway Bus service</p>
              <p>it's really attractive for the Office guy @ am/pm peak hr.s</p>
              <p>the Expressway Bus service got a long history in HK already</p>

              shooted alot of SBS n SMRT vehicles , firstly i'm not

              <p>recently , i've heard that SMRT purchase 66 unit of M-Benz

              only the ADL E200 , MAN 12.240 , NL273R , Volvo B7RLE , Scania

              <p>but HK The RD is too narrow so v can't introduce the Articulated

              <p>Oh well, Hi :D</p>
              <p>I really wanted to get over to HK and try at the buses over there. Coz of the large variety of buses and bus companies over there, ADE500, E400, E200 Dart, VSO, DT, LO and VO and etc etc etc.</p>
              <p>Singapore is really getting lag of those Scania K230UB especially with <strong>ONE THOUSAND AND ONE HUNDRED</strong> plain Gemilang and plain Scania K230UBs in Singapore although one by one there are little improvements. And yes, your eyes weren't wrong, 1100 K230UBs in Singapore. Get a heck of how they power, jerk and vibrate. </p>

              <p>how come the name call express service just via so little
              highway oe expressway ? yr mane is express , but via too much
              city/town area , not really express (in my opinion , i've take 502
              n 518 as before)</p>
              <p><strong>the fast foward svc is the most stupid measure(3)</strong></p>

              <p>the buses of SBS exterior some part were <strong>broke and sunken

              <p>SBS / SMRT can operate some point to point Expressway Bus

              <p>1) I agree, sometimes SBST have to really improve in the intervals and frequency of the trips, even at my area have 3 bus services starting from the interchange and goes to the same bus stop where I alight together(the route to my house area is the same), I ever tried on Townlink 293, I have to wait for 10-15 minutes for the bus to arrive, worst, it came a single decker, E4 Batch 2 K230UB. </p>
              <p>2)If K230s are cheap and third-rate, why did SBST and KMB bought them in the first place?</p>
              <p>3)FastForward service does improve the service itself. Try taking FastForward 30e next time you come to Singapore. It plies Harbourfront to Bedok. The trip can take you about less than 1hour then the normal svc 30 1+hour. </p>
              <p>4)I understand that, it's the cause of the bus depot if they wan be hardworking anot. Somehow BNDEP and SLBP(Bedok Nth and Soon Lee bus depot respectively) got a <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> by bus fans here because of bus mantaining and Leyland Olympians -_-"</p>
              <p>5) Try taking some Premium services in Singapore. It serves the AM peak with only single trips. Although it cannot beat MRTs, at least you can travel without having to squeeze and squeeze on the bus. But the trip itself can go as high as two trips of MRT. Ranging from $3~$5 from SBST Premium bus services to SMRT to private ones. From what I observe is that sometimes the Premium Bus Services doesn't really help in the bus trips from what I saw and say from two trips of Premium 553 which serves my house. </p>

              <p><br>You should either count KMB+LWB+NWFB+CTB+NLB (franchised buses only), and you should only count buses registered under franchise, i.e. training buses, CTB19, 179, 1... should not be included.</p>
              <p>If you include DBTSL, you should include all other non-franchised bus companies including Kwoon Chung, MTRC, Red Cross, Keung Kee, CUHK, HKU, HK Electric, CLP Power, Wing Yip, Sing HIng, CTS, Eternal East, Cherry, HAS, TMCA, HIT...</p>
              <p>And for those in SG, the same principle should also apply, say SG-Johor Express, Tong Par, Woodlands Transport, Sentosa, Bus Plus (part of SMRT), Yellow School Bus, Gullimard...</p>
