            <div class='col-md body'>I am very unsad about the incident happened on 10th of Feb 2007. That day, I boarded Express 502 (SBS 369M) at about 10.30pm at the Esplanade bus This bus arrrived late. More importantly, the seats were all filled up by the passengers from Suntec City. This would affect the downstream passengers would be affected waiting along the Orchard bus stops. Of course, they got no choice but to stand as that was just a single decker bus. It gets worst when the bus approached the bus stop at DFS. Passengers were standing on the stairs at the entrance and most passengers had moved to the rear of the bus. You would say that they can wait for the next bus! What was the main problem was, this services which frequency was at about 20 mins for the next bus. Who would want to wait for the next bus?<br><br>As the driver was behind time, he drove very fast. It was good that the driver knew that he was late and try to get back in time. It was be bad that the driver neglected the safety of the passengers. People standing on the stairs were be dangerous to them as the bus was moving very fast. In the journey,  the driver stepped on the brake. Luckily, there were no more lost it balance and  knock towards the windscreen. This is dangerous to us and not to say about the kids. Not only that, the bus was plying along the expressway on high speed with such a heavy loading!<br><br>Finally, the bus got back to Jurong West Ave 5. The driver was still behind time. So there was a woman who was unable to scan her card. So she wasted some time by taking the Ezlink card out from her purse. I knew that was quite timing comsuning. The problem was, the driver need not complain by producing unhappiness speech and even scolded vuglar language!<br><br>Is this the kind of service SBST should give? Why they do not schedule more bus during the weekends to solve the crowds? Why they do not want to operate 502A and 502B or even deploy more buses or Double Decker buses when they should knew long ago that there were high demand on this service during the weekends. This would greatly solve the crowd and not causing passengers to stand on the stairs. For the driver, even if you are late, you should not be giving this type of attitude to the passengers?<br></div>

There's no damned need to compete with a car at all. I have seen so many bus drivers who are skilled and are able to drive smoothly in congested road conditions.<br><br>I should damned well know, because I'm a bus passenger everyday. Then once in a while you get idiots who choose to play toss-the-salad with the passengers, you stand in one for a sampling and you tell us if you love to be jerked around when you're not jerked beef?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

A guy who couldnt walk wanted to board the bus , then another passerby enquired where the bus was going for that person , then that person attempted to board the bus . the BC immediately got up from his seat , went out of the bus and helped the passenger up , for about 2 mins . the bus behind us , 298J On 334 overtook us .  the passenger sat at the " unofficial seat " beside the door where the validator used to be as the bus was packed to the door . then the passenger thanked the BC . then the bus reached JW ave 3 first busstop after Corporation Pri . then passengers all alighted , when the bus about to moving off , the "challenged" passenger pressed the bell and told the BC that he wanted to get off at this stop the BC braked and stopped , opened the front door . by now , the bus was off the busstop . then it was raining , the BC went out and pulled out something , i think it was the side desto and placed it on the ground so that the passenger could get onto the kerb easily . then he slowly held on to the passenger as he alighted from the bus , by then the bus was still packed to the door and everyone was wondering what the hell was going on . once the BC got the passenger down , he went up to the bus and took all the passenger's belongings , opened the umbrella and escorted the passenger back to the busstop . The whole alighting incident took about 5minutes due to the bad weather conditions , but i didnt mind as this was the first time that a BC would go to such an extent  and walk the Passenger back to the busstop and  assist the passenger in boarding and alighting !.  then the BC ran back and continued driving off as he was behind time . I wouldnt mind being late if i had to witness a GOOD deed !<br><br>This BC deserves to be Recognised<br>The BC was doing 18P . second round .<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
