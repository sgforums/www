As fo rtling off 51 rgo i cannot la. bad memeory. even worst is the service ply my area like mad i still dun cannot ratle off. i would resort to cheating by using my fleet list. wuuuu lol.<br><br>and why is jack jack holding his 147 rear desto.. its the first version SBS rear dto. i wish i had one of those. can reflect light one at night.<br><br>. lol. yes jack guide collection is impressive one. . i din go n count my one. but shd be same number 600. from 1999 marh. same marh . jack n me trade guides collect more or less the same ones lorh.<br><br>i expanding my guides collection to feature overseas guides also.<br><br>I go oversea also must shoot bus pic or get guides . neglect touring malls or attractions . haaaa.<br><br>I just  met Yicheng the other day. got to know him more as the photo enthusiast. likes to take ads. Jakc also lik to take pic of ni ads. due to their infulkence i am pruning my skills to take ad pics also. it is due to them i started to notice ads on bsues as very nice to see and appreciate. current fav is the tiger beer new one.<br><br>i've only met James once b4. we took his car go to defu to see a un restored Nissan 4R94 stuck in a junk yard. one day we hope to restore the thing and use it as some sort of club room or what. or so that was the suggestion meted during in that trip to see the bus.<br><br>ZYX<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I won not say I know a lot about buses... like bus model etc etc, but I roughly know what type of model it is by looking at the Bus plates... For example, SBS 90xx,91xx is the old type of double decker with the TV mobile set on the right side of the first floor etc etc... [Also I prefer to know more about SBS Transit Services]<br><br>Also, When I was 13 to 14 years old, I use to take SBS Transit Buses to tour around Singapore early in the morning. I would have planned which service I wanted to take b4 I set the trip, but I would make Choa Chu Kang Interchange a Must to go [As during 1999, I receive the bad news that SBS Transit is being forced to give up the services there, thus my plan always have the equation 67 --&gt; 188, as SBS Transit Service 190 have already fallen] For example, since I live in Bedok, the first service that I take would be a service in Bedok Interchange. For Example, SBS Transit Service 30. I would take the service all the way to Boon Lay, then change to SBS Transit 154, taking the service all the way to Eunos Interchange, then take SBS Transit 93 all the way to World Trade Center [Now known as HarbourFront Interchange]<br><br>In summary, my trip can be summarise in the following equation: An example: 30--&gt; 154--&gt; 93--&gt; 188--&gt; 67 --&gt; 10 --&gt; 151 --&gt; 74 --&gt; 145 --&gt; 26. I would also make sure that I don go to the same Interchange &amp; Terminal twice, but my trip would always ends in Bedok Interchange and I would make sure that I at least take around 10+ SBS Transit Services before I go back to Bedok Interchange [Of course lah, coz I live in Bedok mah =X] Also, I still have the old SBS Transit Service Guides of the Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang Services fallen to SMRT. I refuse, of course, to take the SMRT guides [ except for services like 180, 187, 178 as they are been taken over when SBS Transit have not started printing the Service guides and those services which SMRT created themselves, like 851, 852 etc etc]<br><br>I will not dare to say I know every SBS Transit services very well, but my liking for SBS Transit as their Bus services is real. ^^<br><br>Hope you will know a bit more about me through this mail ^^<br><br>Shinn</div>
