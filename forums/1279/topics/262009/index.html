With the terrorism threat and all that happening around us, i dont blame the BC for being Kay Poh about ppl taking photos.<br><br>This applies the same to taking photos inside Bus interchange and terminals. Althought some interchange may have the heck care attitude of people taking photos, but that doesnt mean that we could do that all the time. we will never know if the authorities have already been notice about us. Im not saying that taking photos of buses means that we are terrorists. Just to be safe. This is Singapore, where Bus Fans are not really that big group and well-known as compared to other countries like UK, Australia or even HongKong. Just to be safe, we should always try to refrain from taking photos at sensitive locations like Airport and Bus Terminals/Interchanges.<br><br>Hope you guys understand why are we always trying to stress the importance of not taking photos inside the interchange and sensitive places. we have known people of getting caught by the authorities and were given rounds of interviews before the person was being released.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a photographer (not only in buses, I must say), I find a big heart necessary to go for big and good photos. Experience is good, sunlight is good (but don't stress too much on it) and angle is good (not saying myself lah, alot of fellow forumnites do it good too).<br>Go ahead and shoot shots that you feel good.</div>
