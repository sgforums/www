He said something loudly but I don't know what he was talking about as I don't understand Korean. So I just smiled at him and walked off - observed him still stopping there for like another 5 mins before driving off lol.<br><br>Back home, most are just curious but generally friendly. Can't blame them as got quite a number who snap photos of them just to send to SBST to complain over some minor thing (stomp comes to mind), so they have a right to worry about their rice bowl. A friendly return smile and wave after taking photos sometimes help =D<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, I have reported a certain SMRTB bus driver for being rude &amp; having a general attitude problem before after outright accusing me of being a terrorist after I took a photo of his bus. My feeling is that while a bus driver has to be naturally cautious &amp; vigilant in the light of current security threats, being aggressive without reason is a strict no-no. From what I know, he was suspended shortly after I made the complain (apparently got other compains against him too). Another case where a complain was nearly filed was when an "ah beng" driver (yes complete with dyed hair, shirt tucked out) stopped his chartered bus indiscrimately in a filter lane to confront &amp; threaten for taking a photo of his bus. Interestingly he said something about SMRTB being a big corporation and is not to be messed upon, an absolute irony to his untidy appearance &amp; his attitude!<br><br>Agree about the fact that most don't know that such an unusual hobby actually exists...my uncle was with SBST for some 20 years and it was only just before retirement that he saw me taking photo of him driving his bus and requested for a print of it as he had never ever saw peeps taking photo of him at work before!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've never met BCs scolding me while I'm taking photos of buses but some BCs posed at my camera, flash its headlight. Some just stare at me and drove off. I never care about what other people think about me when I was sitting at a bus stop/stand at the roadside taking photos of buses. I met some suspicious looking perdestrian, I just hold my camera tightly with both hands. I seldomly look at the BCs' reaction, especially when there are somemore buses queuing behind. Some just wave and smile at me, maybe they're giving signal of "hi" to me. Some BCs are funny but they seems to be quite friendly.</div>
