            <div class='col-md body'>Their purchases of japanese buses are long ago so dont blame them but I feel really they should replace the UDs . Well ,every bus company have their own good and bad buses. Part and parcel of life really. Look at the bright side, at least they have some decent buses.<br><br>I feel that the UDs should be dump on less popular routes , I have no complaints of UDs on 178 and  980. In fact 980 should use more UDs until newer buses comes.<br><br>I hate some of the converted aircon buses like the Scania (SMRT) , horrible aircon if you sit near the rear. Sometimes I can see open windows , i dont blame them really for opening the window .This is something that SMRT should  be looking at.<br><br>SMRT : Time for you to replace those lousy Nissan diesels.<br>SBST : Time for you to replace those lousy scanias (31L-80U) but the CAC buses are not so bad.<br><br>Anyway back to the topic : Most pampered svc ? One svc comes into my mind , svc 25. Why so many VSOS on that service ? I feel 3 should be more then enough , the rest should be given to svc 22, 166 and others. I dont know but I haven't see svc 24 and 53 with Volvo buses for a long time . I saw svc 24 and 53 with Mark 4 DM body bus , just once and that's it. Even the lousy scania bus appeared on svc 53 once. According to a friend, he told me that those svcs are from AMK depot and they have Volvo SD buses . Question is why dont they deploy those Volvo Mark 4 buses as cameos at least on 24 or 53 ? Not only those svcs , 139, 145, 135 ,have no cameo volvo buses (correct me if I am wrong ) . What is wrong with AMK depot ? Are they fcuk up or what? I am not happy with SBST and the fact with so many lousy scanias on svc 33 which I take everyday. Like or hate it, Suck thumb.</div>

One svc comes into my mind , svc 25. Why so many VSOS on that service ? I feel 3 should be more then enough , the rest should be given to svc 22, 166 and others. I dont know but I haven't see svc 24 and 53 with Volvo buses for a long time . I saw svc 24 and 53 with Mark 4 DM body bus , just once and that's it. Even the lousy scania bus appeared on svc 53 once. According to a friend, he told me that those svcs are from AMK depot and they have Volvo SD buses . Question is why dont they deploy those Volvo Mark 4 buses as cameos at least on 24 or 53 ? Not only those svcs , 139, 145, 135 ,have no cameo volvo buses (correct me if I am wrong ) . What is wrong with AMK depot ? Are they fcuk up or what? I am not happy with SBST and the fact with so many lousy scanias on svc 33 which I take everyday. Like or hate it, Suck thumb. </div></blockquote>I suppose you are not a regular on service 980. I would not deny the fact that 980 has low loads during off peak hours. But on peak hours and Weekends the loads increased by few folds. These poor Nissans will be crawling their way to their respective destinations. Do your homework before commenting.<br><br>We can never know the reasons behind the deployments from Central. Certain models are found or not found on a particular services, only their management will know. All the Mercedes Benz buses made up almost 1/4 of the entire SMRT fleet, and perhaps due to the long heritage of the Mercedes buses present in Central area, having these models in bulk made maintenance easier so as to expedite the expertise of the technicians. Perhaps you can think of some powerful reasons and feedback to SBS Transit on why they should deploy Volvo buses on non-Volvo routes.<br><br>On your account of unhappiness over service 33 Scania buses, you can always use an alternative route with Volvo buses.<br><br>On a side note, these complaints sound familiar......</div>
