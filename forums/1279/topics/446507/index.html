              <p>Singapore faces a shortage of bus drivers, the Public Transport Council (PTC) said on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Unless transport operators can attract more recruits, they may not be
               able to put enough buses on the roads, said PTC chairman Gerard Ee. 
              'Finding enough bus captains is a challenge,' he added.</p>
              <p>About 30 per cent of the 1,900 bus drivers employed by SMRT are from 
              Malaysia or China. 'As Singaporeans are becoming better qualified with 
              higher career aspirations, it has become increasingly difficult to 
              attract them to become service leaders,' said an SMRT spokesman.</p>
              <p>The transport operator has organised 
              recruitment drives in Singapore and abroad. It is also working with 
              agencies such as the community development councils and National Trades 
              Union Congress to help spread the net wider.</p>

              <p>there are many ppl who dun like the PRC drivers.. say why must hire PRC drivers.. Why dun pay more to hire Singaporeans drivers.. But how much more to pay to hire Singaporeans drivers? S$4000/month? then who is going to pay for the increase in salary etc? When the fare is raised by 1 cents or 2 cents, ppl complain and yet they want to see more singaporeans drivers...and more new buses, but not willing to pay higher fares of 1ct or 2 ct?</p>
              <p>Who will want to wake up everyday at 3am to go to the bus depot to start work at 5am? or do the PM shift and got home at 2am everyday?</p>
              <p>There are certain ppl who will become bus drivers if pay is increased (but who is going to bear the cost?) but a lot more will resist to become bus drivers, because, of small issue, they will get complains... bus too slow --&gt; complain, bus too fast --&gt; complain...tiny tiny issues---&gt; complain....</p>
              <p>if SBST is willing to pay S$4000per month, sure got many ppl go drive the buses.. but how is SBST going to pay for the additional salary? Imagine 1 driver S$1000/month more, x 3000 drivers = S$3 million in additional wages per month.... who will pay for it? Govt?</p>

              <h1>SBS, SMRT increasingly look to Malaysia, China for bus drivers</h1>
              <p>With Singaporeans reluctant to take up jobs as bus drivers, operators
               SBS Transit and SMRT are increasingly turning to Malaysia and China to 
              plug the gap. The crunch comes at a time when both companies have 
              expanded their fleets and bus ridership has gone up to 3.45 million a 
              day last year, a jump of 12 per cent from 2008.</p>
              <p>The problem has been noted by the Public Transport Council (PTC), 
              which said on Wednesday that Singapore faces a shortage of bus drivers. 
              Unless transport operators can attract more recruits, they may not be 
              able to put enough buses on the roads, said PTC chairman Gerard Ee.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit, Singapore's biggest bus operator, has 
              said it is short by about 180 drivers, even as it and SMRT have not let 
              up on recruitment drives.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit currently has more than 5,300 
              bus drivers, of whom only 61 per cent are Singaporeans and permanent 
              residents. Some 26 per cent are Malaysians, and the rest are from China.</p>

              <p>Greetings from Germany.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If anyone from HR of SBST or SMRT is reading this</span>:</p>
              <p>I've been working as a bus driver for <strong>more than 10 years</strong> now, I have lots of experience with <strong>three-axle double deckers</strong> and <strong>articulated buses</strong>.</p>
              <p>I'd be very happy if I could work as a Bus Captain in Singapore! I've been to Singapore as recently as March 2011, and yes - I'd like to live there permanently!</p>
              <p>I've applied twice for a position as Bus Captain via SBST's online form, and my application was declined twice. A friend of mine in Singapore told me that he couldn't imagine SBST would hire Europeans as Bus Captains ...</p>
              <p>If there really is such a shortage of Bus Captains, maybe SBST and SMRT should reconsider their positions towards hiring someone from Germany.</p>
              <p>Singapore, here I come again ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>(P.S. Just reply to this thread, and I'll get in touch, via phone or e-mail.)</p>

It much better then those from china, not even know english and some time rule to customer and other user on the road. But working in singapore you must know how to speak chinese and maybe malay is the advanage. SBST has many Citaro new bus from Germany. And SMRT has many MAN new buses</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe SBST and SMRT can look to hire drivers from Eastern European countries instead of only from China. Maybe Greek and Italians because of the state of their economy? And Italians are notorious for driving too fast and being reckless. Imagine the fun! Lol. I guess most of them can speak English, albeit with a very thick accent. Might be interesting though.</div>

              <p>there are many ppl who dun like the PRC drivers.. say why must hire PRC drivers.. Why dun pay more to hire Singaporeans drivers.. But how much more to pay to hire Singaporeans drivers? S$4000/month? then who is going to pay for the increase in salary etc? When the fare is raised by 1 cents or 2 cents, ppl complain and yet they want to see more singaporeans drivers...and more new buses, but not willing to pay higher fares of 1ct or 2 ct?</p>
              <p>Who will want to wake up everyday at 3am to go to the bus depot to start work at 5am? or do the PM shift and got home at 2am everyday?</p>
              <p>There are certain ppl who will become bus drivers if pay is increased (but who is going to bear the cost?) but a lot more will resist to become bus drivers, because, of small issue, they will get complains... bus too slow --&gt; complain, bus too fast --&gt; complain...tiny tiny issues---&gt; complain....</p>
              <p>if SBST is willing to pay S$4000per month, sure got many ppl go drive the buses.. but how is SBST going to pay for the additional salary? Imagine 1 driver S$1000/month more, x 3000 drivers = S$3 million in additional wages per month.... who will pay for it? Govt?</p>

              <p><strong>Josephine Teo on employment of foreigners as bus drivers</strong></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE : Minister of State for Finance and Transport, 
              Josephine Teo, on Friday addressed concerns about the employment of 
              foreigners as bus drivers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>Speaking in 
              Parliament, Mrs Teo said it is increasingly difficult to recruit 
              Singaporeans as bus drivers, due to rising career aspirations.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>She said this is due
               to rising educational attainments and rising career aspirations. Other 
              industries, including the construction sector, have also begun to offer 
              better remuneration and better working conditions.<br><br>About 280 locals are hired as bus drivers each year, compared to 800 foreigners.<br><br>They are primarily from Malaysia and China.<br><br>About 1,000 drivers, or 14 per cent of the driver pool, leave each year.<br><br>Mrs
               Teo said: "I think we must also realise that there is a difference 
              between the terms of employment for locals as well as the foreigners. 
              Foreigners are here on contract. So some of them, at the end of the 
              contract, they leave the service. And they are also counted within that 
              1,000. <br><br>"So if you were to look purely at the rates of attrition,
               then it would seem that the attrition is higher amongst the foreigners.
               But a large part of it is because they have completed their contracts."<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
