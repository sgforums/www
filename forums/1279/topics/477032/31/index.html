              <p><br>Thanks for accepting my point of view. Somewhere we agree. Just a comment on sv 72. It had horrible loading at one point of time. With significant upgrades to 72 itself, the loading now has been spaced out. There is also 72A which used to be totally packed before but now has around 40-50 pax. 72 with the number of buses added now has around 70-75 pax per bus. Those days when buses used to be 100+ pax are gone.</p>
              <p>If 72 was not getting these upgrades, 116 routing would have made complete sense. But LTA added capacity on 72 and introduced 116 on same route. At HG Interchange, PM peak, you will still see people wait at 72 stop and 116 bus leaves with a mere 20-25 pax at the max from interchange. Does it really serve the purpose? No. If it was calling on st 51,93.. .at least people who would get direct service to their home would wait specially for 116.</p>

              <p>Simple. </p>
              <p>1. Relieve loads on 72. Horrific amount of pax boarding 72 at HG, with half of them heading to Ave 4/9. 116 is a tool to relieve loads so that they can share between Ave 4/9 pax, allowing for more YCK bound pax to board. </p>
              <p>2. Simplify transfer. 116 enters the int while 72 does not. And yes, it is a disadvantage during rainy days. And isn't that LTA's aims, to provide for better alternatives?</p>

              <p>So <strong>dupdup...</strong></p>
              <p>what do you think? After 116 more than a year operation and low patronage between Hougang and Hougang 1 area, should LTA not modify this route to ply HG St 51, 93 and then come to Serangoon North Ave 4?</p>
              <p>Or will LTA remain stubborn to continue run parallel to 72 when 72 is managing the load very well. St 51 and St 93 residents mean nothing to LTA that it does not offer them direct service? Now is the solution for LTA to introduce a new route to cater to these two routes, or edit an existing non-used route?</p>

              <p>So <strong>dupdup...</strong></p>
              <p>what do you think? After 116 more than a year operation and low
              patronage between Hougang and Hougang 1 area, should LTA not modify
              this route to ply HG St 51, 93 and then come to Serangoon North Ave
              4?</p>
              <p>Or will LTA remain stubborn to continue run parallel to 72 when
              72 is managing the load very well. St 51 and St 93 residents mean
              nothing to LTA that it does not offer them direct service? Now is
              the solution for LTA to introduce a new route to cater to these two
              routes, or edit an existing non-used route?</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I think they will let it ply the major road hougang ave 9 first. Demand for main road should still be satisfied first. Residents along hougang st 51, 91, 93 can still walk to buangkok green and hougang ave 9, the 2 major roads. If the need really arises, another bus service must go into these little streets. Cheers. </p>

              <p>So all that I have written about no-demand - you really did not read that right. HG Ave 9 has a lot of services to cater. HG St 51 has only 101 in one direction, st 91/93 a part of it has no service. But they should walk. Even though HG Ave 9 residents have luxury of a 72 DD every 05/06 mins. If a 116 follows a 72, it will not have more than 10-15 pax on board.</p>
              <p>Take the bus. LTA should also come out of their office and take the bus during peak hours and they will know. A 116 before 72 can take few pax, but that is not how you judge the need of a service because then the 72 behind will go empty when it can take the pax.</p>
              <p>anyway, it is all fail fail here... useless management.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I read. Who says I did not read? But you are advocating a major amendment. At most, after it goes hougang ave 4, it should at most be amended to go into hougang st 91 then come out to serve hougang ave 9 en route to serangoon. Not to go to hougang st 51 and 93. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr 23ispolo, I think the 2 most likely reasons are because 1.
              the new HDB flats at rivervale crescent are up for more than 6
              months already and that part of sengkang estate is badly linked. 2.
              The nearest major road within walking distance is rivervale drive.
              That major road only has LRT and sbs 86 (a bit winding to sengkang
              mrt). So no choice since only 1 main service sbs 86 on that major
              road, they have to introduce sbs 371 to go by rivervale drive and
              loop at rivervale crescent. In that sense, they give the major road
              rivervale drive 2 services and ply the inner route rivervale
              crescent as well. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Cheers</p>
