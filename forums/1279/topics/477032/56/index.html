              take 80/82 to Hougang than 163 to Sengkang. After these stops I am

              <p>Hi mr bus analyser, your statement that sbs 82 connects entire stretch of Punggol road is wrong. It connects 95% of Punggol road. There is 1 bus stop opp blk 293 in Punggol road which is served only by sbs 34. This is because sbs 82 has already turned into direction of Punggol place and MRT. So you must not say entire stretch of Punggol road which may mislead others. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3004X, this is not possible. How to undo? There are not enough spaces in bus interchanges even if you undo route shortening to return to the pre-NEL rationalization because other services have been introduced and no of buses for certain service numbers has been tremendously ramped up and also hougang south interchange is no longer using. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr 23ispolo, yes sbs 84 goes to Punggol road (north side) and Punggol road end. There is also one bus stop in the middle (opp blk 293) served by sbs 34 only. Then the rest of Punggol road is served by sbs 82 (this side of Punggol road is the one Mr busAnalayser is referring to). Cheers </p>

              <p>In the post he quoted, your basis of misleading is that you did not include the stretch of Punggol Road which 84 plies, and with that pair of bus stops you mentioned + the figure "95%" it does amount to a misleading (despite you mentioning it later in your following posts, but I doubted that users would have linked multiple posts by you to support that point).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in all I believe that the current stretch of Punggol Road which 82 plies is suppose to be 55% of the whole Punggol Road, not 95% (I checked using the interactive map feature on PublicTransport.sg and observed that the length of Punggol Road which services 82 &amp; 84 plied each is nearly as long with a 10% difference).</p>

              <p>In the post he quoted, your basis of misleading is that you did
              not include the stretch of Punggol Road which 84 plies, and with
              that pair of bus stops you mentioned + the figure "95%" it does
              amount to a misleading (despite you mentioning it later in your
              following posts, but I doubted that users would have linked
              multiple posts by you to support that point).</p>
              <p>Furthermore, in all I believe that the current stretch of
              Punggol Road which 82 plies is suppose to be 55% of the whole
              Punggol Road, not 95% (I checked using the interactive map feature
              on PublicTransport.sg and observed that the length of Punggol Road
              which services 82 &amp; 84 plied each is nearly as long with a 10%
              difference).</p>

              <p>Hi mr Gus.chong, yes it will have been better if I have said everything in the same post. I thought people do read all subsequent posts too. </p>
              <p>As per my earlier reply, my 95% is just a first instant sort of reply to mean it is not the entire stretch. Of course normally people will not take great extent to check the exact distance measured. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, no ill feelings here. Nothing wrong with pointing out an error in the whole stretch of Punggol road. There is no need to say me to be a grandfather or whatsoever. I am not causing any bad intent or criticize anybody. As most people can tell from the tone of my messages that are well mannered and soft with totally no intent to provoke people even when people write to me in a harsh tone. Anyway my motto in life is to move on. No point dwelling on such issues. Let's be amicable, ok? I offer my apologies if you think I pointing out a slight issue is considered offensive to you.

              <p>** Happy with 307P/358P/359P as there are no high capacity buses
