              <p>Hi mr SMB128B</p>
              <p>1. Closed. Cheers</p>
              <p>2. Many residents in Punggol complain to MP about poor public transport for years. There is no way bus services can always go inside Punggol and come out of punggol. Thus the only logical way is to build bus stops outside Punggol and sengkang along TPE. Naturally, buses which go through whole of TPE must stop at the new bus stop which was purposely built for. </p>
              <p>3. TV news today have already broadcast this Punggol west LRT opening in mid 2014. You never switch on TV?</p>
              <p>After west LRT opens, it is natural that one bus service must ply along the routes adjacent to it. So this will happen months or even 1 year after. This is very normal thinking la. No need to be from LTA to know this. </p>
              <p>Haha. You are not in line with the latest happenings and link me to LTA again? Hahaha.</p>
              <p>4. So sbs 50 also benefitted you?</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, </p>
              <p>I am not transport planner. But I can tell you this. </p>
              <p>Sbs 119 comes out from bus int and moves left side of Punggol field (serves west residents).</p>
              <p>sbs 83 comes out from bus interchange and moves right side towards Punggol central and loops 1 round towards Punggol field (the right side)</p>
              <p>sbs 82 comes out from bus int and moves right side of Punggol field towards Punggol road straight out. </p>
              <p>Sbs 136 duplicates small portion of sbs 83 before out on Punggol road. </p>
              <p>This clearly shows sbs 83 and sbs 119 serving different catchment of people. You cannot just say combine mean combine. If you don't believe me, you can ask BusAnalyser tell you the routes. </p>
              <p>What I mean is we prefer taking mrt rather than sbs 119 when comparing both mrt and 119. When you stay here, you will know what I mean. I do not know why you need do survey. Not comparing all buses vs mrt. Only comparing sbs 119 route and mrt. </p>
              <p>I think you still don't get it. I am not LTA. LTA pisses commuters and that is their problem. If moderators think I piss them off when I am just an ordinary public transport loving guy, then I have nothing to say. I doubt moderators are so naive to think this way. Anyway I am not from LTA.

              <p>2. Didn't answer my qns. So don't think 168 will stop there. Cheers. </p>
              <p>3. I was late, sorry. But there will be a bus boom. I mean, why not? Punggol will need them anyways. Why rob away the resources of other locations when it could be done in within?</p>
              <p>4. Unfortunately, nope. I am a frequent commuter between the east and Sengkang. So 27 is like my pulse for traveling on PT. Why not YOU tell me what shit has been done on 27?! No BSRF when 27 well deserved it, no DD x-overs still on 27A and downroutes, no BSEP, and the list goes on!! </p>
              <p>And even if I were to go to Bishan why must I take that fucking long-winded service when even MRT is better than it.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, </p>
              <p>I am not transport planner. But I can tell you this. </p>
              <p>Sbs 119 comes out from bus int and moves left side of Punggol
              field (serves west residents).</p>
              <p>sbs 83 comes out from bus interchange and moves right side
              towards Punggol central and loops 1 round towards Punggol field
              (the right side)</p>
              <p>sbs 82 comes out from bus int and moves right side of Punggol
              field towards Punggol road straight out. </p>
              <p>Sbs 136 duplicates small portion of sbs 83 before out on Punggol
              road. </p>
              <p>This clearly shows sbs 83 and sbs 119 serving different
              catchment of people. You cannot just say combine mean combine. If
              you don't believe me, you can ask BusAnalyser tell you the
              routes. </p>
              <p>What I mean is we prefer taking mrt rather than sbs 119 when
              comparing both mrt and 119. When you stay here, you will know what
              I mean. I do not know why you need do survey. Not comparing all
              buses vs mrt. Only comparing sbs 119 route and mrt. </p>
              <p>I think you still don't get it. I am not LTA. LTA pisses
              commuters and that is their problem. If moderators think I piss
              them off when I am just an ordinary public transport loving guy,
              then I have nothing to say. I doubt moderators are so naive to
              think this way. Anyway I am not from LTA. Cheers.</p>

              <p>3. I was late, sorry. But there will be a bus boom. I mean, why

              <p>4. Unfortunately, nope. I am a frequent commuter between the
              east and Sengkang. So 27 is like my pulse for traveling on PT. Why
              not YOU tell me what shit has been done on 27?! No BSRF when 27
              well deserved it, no DD x-overs still on 27A and downroutes, no
              BSEP, and the list goes on!! </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B</p>
              <p>2. 6 months estimated down the road, the bus stop will be operational. Then all numbers will be shown. Now only prediction.</p>
              <p>3. It is okay. Bus services increase yes. But not big boom. Restricted by West LRT. News state new bus services to punggol may come end of yr 2014. </p>
              <p>4. The only sensible reason I can think of is sbs 27 (other than sbs 96 and sbs 179) has one of the super highest frequencies. So they may think that passengers should be able to get onto sbs 27 or sbs 27A no matter how crowded it can get. Even if 1 bus is missed, there is no big issue to get to the 2nd bus.</p>
              <p>Yes from sengkang side, mrt to bishan via transfers is much faster. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Every person wants a service from his door step that will take him to places without transfer. This is just not possible. According to me Punggol is well connected. Towns that are not connected well are CCK, Bukit Gambok, Sembawang that have very poor connectivity. If you look at Woodlands also, most people have to come to WRI to take a bus service (trunk) or go along Sembawang - Yishun long route.</p>
              <p>Punggol comparatively has much better connectivity. It is the starting point of NEL. People at any time get place to sit. Has LRT. Has bus services parallel to LRT + connecting most areas. Plus it is an end-town, so definitely in-between towns like Sengkang/Hougang will have better connectivity. That's you should know before choosing to live in Punggol and that's why you pay lesser for living in Punggol compared to Serangoon.</p>

              <p>I think it does include PPSS and City Direct. Otherwise they wont meet their quota of 40 by end of 2014.</p>

Need this service. A must! Can also be extended to Sungei Kadut Loop/Crescent, completely ignored by LTA/SMRT. Complete no-no for extension of 300. It has too much of its load to manage, and I would not want it to get into any scheduling mess.</span></p>
              <p>2)Punggol to seletar aerospace park (i think wait till the flyover &amp; the new roads there finish then can have new service perhaps? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, this could be an option via Senthul, Punggol west, but the question is that does Seletar aerospace have that many pax still working there? Is there going to be more industrial development? Else a feeder in Punggol west will definitely come up in future.</span></p>
              <p>3)Sembawang shld have a new route too. anyone wants to comment on this? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sembawang will have many new routes. It needs to have one to Canberra Square, trunk services to Tampines/UEC and trunk service to BBT/JE. I would also recommend that sv 39 be extended here. I would prefer if one of trunk services to east goes via Yishun Ave 7 and 6 to Yishun Ave 1 and then to Seletar Aerospace, Punggol and then Tampines. </span></p>

Hence, can also have one trunk service from CCK to Clementi go via BBT Road, CCK Ave 5 extension.</span></p>
