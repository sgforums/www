              <p><br>I agree. I have observed that the loading in the non-peak direction is also quite significant. Towards Simei in AM, pax can be around 80+. Also many use Simei to get to Upper Changi and many times you have 80+ pax here. With the recent loading, 13 DDs is not enought. SBST should change it to 15 DDs, 10 SDs with ARBP giving the 2 DDs.</p>
              <p>The route between Bukit Merah and Trellis Towers is where the loading can be managed well by SDs. After that it is a DD loading, even if there is 59 in parallel.</p>

              <p><br>sv 36 has got lots of service improvements in the recent past. Just adding buses is not going to help. People going to CBD for work do not want to cramp into a 60 pax filled bus. They would want DDs where even if it is 60 pax, all of them can sit and not get their clothes crumpled. LTA needs to understand this.</p>
              <p>36 badly needs DDs, but LTA will do nothing. It can introduce 36B on full day basis with DDs. LTA/SBST are very rigid with their CGA bound fleet and do not want to give its SWT also DDs.</p>

              <p>293 is a strange case, as the bus is only added to the East loop. I feel that the West loop needs it more, as frequencies can go up to 15 mins at times. Most of the east loop is also supplemented by 28 and 29, hence I don't see the need for an additional BSEP.</p>

              <p>There is a reason for it. If you see there are so many HDB units along st 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. And how many services you have? 3 in total with 28 having high capacity buses, 29 have none and 293 have just got a few (3 to be precise). AM peak sv 28 already comes full from st 45. There are times if there is delay in sv 28, people just take 293 even though it will go via Tampines Ave 7, and when it comes to st 42, 43, it is already full. There is absolute need of more high capacity buses. 29 does not justify it because of its route beyond ave 9 but 293 should definitely get 3 more DDs for the whole route.</p>
              <p>West loop - I don't see a big issue. Most stops where it plies has alternatives. Around ave 3, people have the option of 291 and many prefer 291 to get to Tampines. Around ave 8, 69 is infact faster. Along ave 4, you have almost empty buses from sv 22 towards Tampines during AM. Hence, I feel west loop loading is still manageable compared to east loop.</p>
