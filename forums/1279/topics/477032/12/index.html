              <p>401 only weekend service la. Most people who board sv 13 at Eunos alight on Still Road and few on EC / MP Road.</p>
              <p>According to me, people use Paya Lebar MRT more for traveling to EC and Marine Parade road as they get many more services 43, 76, 135 with high capacity buses and good frequency. There is a bus every 03-04 mins at Paya Lebar MRT stop compared to Eunos MRT stop.</p>

              <p>And 112 will need more buses once HG Ave 7 flats are complete...</p>
              <p>113 sector from Hougang to Kovan should be scrapped - too redundant with other services 62, 82, 107. Instead 113A should be operated full day with 4 buses. This would give it a very good frequency, and the people at Kovan MRT will be very happy. If 113 stays the way it is, the bus will never get fleet add, leave upgrades, and we have seen this even though BSEP/HGDEP have so many SP buses, can easily crossover 107/153 buses. But have not done so because of Hougang-Kovan loss making sector. I just saw other day at 5.30pm bus arriving at HG Ave 2 from HG side with just 4 pax on board. Why would they add more buses to this route 5010P?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Also 113 loading at Kovan has dropped after significant upgrade to 45/53. People now prefer to change at Serangoon than Kovan. Now you seee 113 buses during PM peak not as full as they used to be few months back. Why? No fleet add, no DD. Because people have moved to Serangoon. And it is the smart thing to do. 53/53B comes at a 5-7 minute interval during PM peak. 45 comes also under 10 mins and with DDs times for PM peak.</p></div>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I was thinking of this. Maybe don't even need a new service. They can just divert sv 9 to loop @ Alps Ave, considering duplication with sv 19 until tampines ave 7. Sv 19, 89 will continue to Cargo.</p>
              <p>This move will definitely benefit lot of people from Alps Ave.</p>

              <p>Just a little education for you on 112 loading pattern.</p>
              <p>Typical AM peak loading:</p>
              <p>10-15 pax between HG and HG Ave 7</p>
              <p>30-40 pax between HG Ave 7 and Kovan (a lot of people in fact board on HG St 21)</p>

              <p>&lt;20 pax between HG Ave 8 and looping point</p>
              <p>40-50 pax between looping point and HG Ave 2 (depends a lot on 147 calling the stop)</p>
              <p>60-70 pax between HG Ave 2 and Kovan (depends a lot on 132 calling the stops)</p>
              <p>20-25 pax between Kovan and HG Ave 7</p>

              <p><br>I would like to hear your thoughts as to why it is not a good idea. I am not a big fan of launching new bus routes everywhere, if current routes can be optimized. I say this because more routes, more buses, more traffic, more consumption of gas/resources. At the same time routes should not be optimized/rationalized if it is going to cause disturbance to many commuters. If it is only a handful, they can still use the advantage of bus transfer system without penalty. Just my thoughts.</p>
