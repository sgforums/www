              <p>Here we go again.  Ppl are still having the mind sets that
              all bus yservices (new or old) must be crowded during all operating
              hours.   As long as some buses/services are not crowded , it
              is a waste of resources/money n must be withdrawn or amended. Some
              parts of the new bus services routes are purposely drawn to
              duplicate current services route to help to spread out the
              paxes. </p>
              <p> As if sbstransit or smrt wan to operate the bus services
              during off peak hours? If they can they will just operate all bus
              services during peak hours to maximise their earning n minimise
              their running costs.  </p>

              <p>Which illustrates my point.</p>
              <p>Loading itself cannot be the only factor to justify the existence of routes. Connectivity needs to be considered as well. Otherwise the above-mentioned routes can be argued to be a waste of resources as they run largely empty during off-peak hours and operators face a greater challenge in operating these routes as compared to other better-patronised routes.</p>
              <p>I am not allowed make specific comments on individual routes, but I know the loadings of the entire ops period well enough to make this general comment.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, have they not made the change previously, Punggol interchange will be free of some spaces for other new semi-express services to go to places like orchard and marina square. Now currently sbs 82 and sbs 84 take up those slots. Moreover, the route of sbs 82 is not very unique. Even if it loops at Punggol road end, it still serves the same catchment of passengers.

              <p>You can't say that...</p>
              <p>Svcs like 12, 27, 240, 372 do have load during
              off-peak. </p>
              <p>List goes on. </p>
              <p>120? Nah. </p>
              <p>What you have to understand is that some svcs have such a low
              ridership during off-peak it does not justify the amount of buses
              deployed or even warrant the operating times. For example, every
              weekends and every night after 8 svc 5 gets full SD fleet due to
              lower ridership. </p>
              <p>Go look at HK. They do reduce svcs to run only on weekday peak
              to cut down costs and save taxpayers money. When loading gets too
              low and the svc has little exclusive area to run (ie heavy
              duplication along most of its route). You have to understand,
              resources are not infinite. In fact new svcs in HK are introduced
              through regrouping and reshuffling its current bus svcs. As such
              some svcs get reduced or even withdrawn to introduce a new svc, or
              add freq to another high-demand svc. </p>
              <p>I give you one example. Svc 798, TKL/TKO &lt;-&gt; Shatin.
              Express svc. During Peak hour gets so crowded with so many people
              going to Shatin in the morning (and vice versa) even an average
              freq of 7 mins with 12m DDs could barely cope with the load. Fleet
              came from withdrawn 796B, which very rarely gets crowded, and
              downgraded 797M, which is practically empty during
              off-peak. </p>
              <p>You see how resources are used here? Same should be applied to
              120. In fact had it not been the quite-acceptable load during peak
              I would have thought it to be withdrawn. Now that there are some
              load after all (seen quite a number alighting from 120 during AM
              peak), maybe it should be dealt with another way. Either way it
              will be able to benefit more people out there. </p>

              <p>what smb128b says is true, fellow bus fans can go to the hk bus discussion thread to read abt cancellation of alloted buses for shatin area... Eg 51 cut to 1 bus(SD), freq is 60mins due to poor demand, hwever there will be another bus on standby in case breakdown to maintain quality of service...</p>

              <p>Loading itself cannot be the only factor to justify the

              Otherwise the above-mentioned routes can be argued to be a waste of

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, I think no need at the present. Lack of sufficient loading and the distance travelled will be too long. Currently people will transfer to circle line at serangoon to connect to buona vista to transfer to west side of Singapore (jurong east, Boon Lay) which is considered the fastest as of this moment. As for areas like choa Chu Kang, bukit batok, we take sbs 161 to woodlands and transfer to woodlands mrt. Travel time is slightly more than a direct bus service but it is still manageable.

              <p>Having the buses returning to depot is also such a waste of fuel
              and time. Just like the services mentioned by some parties.</p>
              <p>Might as well just park at interchanges and put fuel pumps next
              to the commuter?<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, I think no need at the present. Lack of
              sufficient loading and the distance travelled will be too long.
              Currently people will transfer to circle line at serangoon to
              connect to buona vista to transfer to west side of Singapore
              (jurong east, Boon Lay) which is considered the fastest as of this
              moment. As for areas like choa Chu Kang, bukit batok, we take sbs
              161 to woodlands and transfer to woodlands mrt. Travel time is
              slightly more than a direct bus service but it is still manageable.
              Cheers.</p>

              <p>Nah.</p>
              <p>Maybe a direct svc from northeast to west will be good. </p>
              <p>Preferable JE. </p>
              <p>I mean, haven't you noticed the growth of JE now? MRT is simply insufficient. Two transfers! So many stops! And the Circle Line is notorious for crawling speeds (understandable due to numerous turns). </p>
              <p>If the CBD can be served with express svcs and direct MRT connections, why can't JE? It's already becoming the second CBD of the entire nation. With the current transport connection it has it puts shame and unfairness to many parts of Singapore! </p>
              <p>Hope the CRL will resolve this issue, and hope its express services will be confirmed and operational during weekends as well along with peak hours. Otherwise an express svc like this should be introduced as a stop-gap. </p>

              <p>How about a semi-express service from Sengkang Int to Jurong East Int via KPE, Bartley Road East, Braddell Road, Lornie Road, PIE, Toh Guan Road and Boon Lay Way? Another option is to have this service go by Macpherson Road to the PIE, but this side of the PIE has high traffic... Thus, I would rather suggest to have it go by Braddell Road, which has low traffic except for the junction with the CTE...</p>
