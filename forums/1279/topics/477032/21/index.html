              <p>Ok dupdup... Let's analyze Punggol area. </p>
              <p>3: Pasir Ris, Tampines (east)</p>
              <p>34: Tampines, CGA (east)</p>
              <p>43: Punggol west to Buangkok Green, YCK road... If someone
              really wants to travel that far by bus also connects whole of Paya
              Lebar, Tanjong Katong, Marine Parade, all the way up to Upper east
              coast</p>
              <p>50: connects Sengkang east, west, YCK road, AMK ave 5, ITE, AMK
              MRT, Bishan MRT</p>
              <p>62: connects HG, Lor Ah Soo, faster connectivity to Upper Paya
              Lebar, Aljunied and Geylang areas</p>
              <p>82: Serangoon (gives full connectivity to Punggol road
              amenities, HG ave 2, Kovan, NEX)</p>
              <p>83: Direct connection to Sengkang</p>
              <p>84: Like an internal feeder to Punggol road end</p>
              <p>85: Connects various parts of Sengkang to Punggol before
              connecting Yishun (direct connection to Yishun that even highly
              populous towns like HG don't have)</p>
              <p>119: Provides direct link to Sengkang west and east, Upper
              Serangoon road</p>
              <p>136: connection to various points within Sengkang, Serangoon,
              all the way to AMK if need be. </p>
              <p>Of all these services, none of them go packed outside of
              Punggol. I have not observed or heard of problems of
              boarding/alighting for passengers on any of these services. 43, 50
              have high loading but outside of Punngol town. 62 is one that I
              have seen can be very crowded while leaving Punggol town. </p>

              <p>3-fastest way to pasir ris. Fairly direct until pasir ris mrt (30 to 35 min). Do not take long winding route to tampines. Not recommended. One of the 2 highest frequencies bus service in Punggol. The other is 83. </p>
              <p>34-fastest way to tampines. 15 min. Bad point is serves a portion of Punggol only. So need transfer. Transfer means increased waiting time. Inconvenient.</p>
              <p>43-good service. Poor frequencies until improved drastically lately. Services a portion of Punggol only. Need transfer. Transfer means increased waiting time.</p>
              <p>50-good route. Ventured into other routes not served previously. Connects directly to red and yellow colour mrt line. Before implementation, Punggol no direct to red colour/yellow colour mrt line. Strongly fight for direct connection. If not, need take 1 bus to Punggol mrt to switch 3 lines before getting on red line mrt.</p>
              <p>62-good service. Connects to many places. Bad point is poor frequencies at off peak.</p>
              <p>83-2nd highest frequencies in Punggol. Cannot live without 3 or 83 if you are a Punggol resident. No complains.</p>
              <p>84-worst frequency over 24 min but understandable since it brings you to jetty. </p>
              <p>85-good fairly direct service but poor frequencies even at peak hour. Miss it and your travelling time increases.</p>
              <p>82, 119, 136-three of the services connecting different parts of Punggol to fairly simar parts of sengkang, hougang and kovan albeit enroute to different destinations. If need take these 3 services, suggest take mrt as part of journey to cut travelling time. No point actually. The routes can be improved. Suggest lengthen 82 and 119 to serve other places not covered. Toa payoh, st Michael, bedok are some suggestions. 119 and 136 frequencies are poor at off peak hours. Can be as bad as 16 to 20 min. </p>
              <p>With TPE bus stop outside Punggol block 103 going to be up in the next few months, connections to bedok will be better when sbs 168 stops there. </p>
              <p>All these point to connectivity can still be improved with many poor frequencies bus services. As for now, even after sbs 50 connects us to red line without need transfer 1 bus plus 3 mrt lines, journey time remains long. Sometimes as long as 1 hr 15 min. Even with mrt connection, still need transfer bus to get to destination. (Of course I don't mean 1 hr 15 min for nearby areas like sengkang, hougang, serangoon)</p>
              <p>I am open to any suggestions. </p>

              <p><br>My friend, first point is, in a big city, 1 transfer should be okay. Also, you are not penalized here for doing transfer because of distance based fare. I also have to point out to you again that not many services leave Punggol houseful. The one suggestion I strongly advocate for Punggol is merger of 82/107 to Shenton Way. This will benefit residents for sure. With Punggol road bus stop on TPE again there will be more access for residents.</p>
              <p>Regarding, 43 - frequency has improved but it is more for loading around Buangkok - NEX area. 43 leaves with only 30-40 pax when it reaches Sengkang. 119 is even more poor.</p>
              <p>Typical AM loading on services exiting Punggol</p>
              <p>3 - 50/60 pax</p>
              <p>34 - 60 pax</p>
              <p>43 - 30/40 pax</p>
              <p>50 - 30/40 pax</p>

              <p>119 - 20/30 pax</p>
              <p>136 - 40/50 pax</p>
              <p>Except sv 62, I haven't really seen a bus exiting Punggol to the limit of its capacity. Even AM DDs on 136 do not have more than 50 pax on board. DDs on 43/119 normally exit Punggol with less than 40 pax on board.</p>

              <p>With TPE bus stop outside Punggol block 103 going to be up in
              the next few months, connections to bedok will be better when sbs
              168 stops there. </p>
              <p>All these point to connectivity can still be improved with many
              poor frequencies bus services. As for now, even after sbs 50
              connects us to red line without need transfer 1 bus plus 3 mrt
              lines, journey time remains long. Sometimes as long as 1 hr 15 min.
              Even with mrt connection, still need transfer bus to get to
              destination. (Of course I don't mean 1 hr 15 min for nearby areas
              like sengkang, hougang, serangoon)</p>
              <p>I am open to any suggestions. </p>

              <p>2. It is not confirmed if 168 will stop at TPE bus stop. In fact I believe it won't stop there as if it does it straightaway destroys the primary purpose of the service, which is to directly connect Seletar and Woodlands to the east. You already have 161, 27, 86 and 87 to travel to the places required. It's not necessary for another SBST svc to snatch the pax away and cause even more congestion and delays on its own buses. </p>
              <p>3. You will see a boom in bus developments when Punggol West and North has finish developing. In fact, given the town's progress now, it has already received substantial amount of transport upgrades and improvements. I believe when Watertown opens, there would be more bus services that will hopefully connect the northwest and the city. </p>

              <p>I believe it's coz of the decision to introduce DDs by SMRT that LTA has finally started funding high-capacity buses for SMRT. So possibly these 450 buses may be all high-capacity buses, with most of it being DDs and maybe a few remaining dozens will be bendies for SMRT Intratowns. </p>
              <p>Good to hear it has been doubled to 80 svcs! At least now I know the svcs earlier aren't really a wastage of BSEP slots. </p>

              <p>1. Yes CCL is connected by sbs 43 and sbs 82 but you have to
              take note that both services ply too short in Punggol before coming
              out of it. If that is the case, we may as well take mrt to transfer
              to CCL. Don't ever mention about NSL connected by sbs 136. Journey
              time is 1 hr 10 min for sbs 136 just to connect Punggol mrt to Ang
              mo kio mrt? If need to transfer, the journey time will exceed 1 hr
              30 min. </p>
              <p>Sbs 85 also connects to NSL at khatib mrt. Though journey time
              is 40 min, one has to take mrt downwards to other red colour mrt
              stations. This will be equivalent to sbs 50 going to Ang mo kio or
              bishan mrt. </p>
              <p>2. From sources, bus services which ply whole of TPE like 39,
              168, 858, 969 will stop at TPE stop. I doubt stopping at 1 extra
              stop at TPE bus stop will destroy the primary purpose as what you
              claim. Take note this stop is along the way of these 4 bus
              services. Not re-routing or drastic amendment of route.
              Cheers. </p>
              <p>3. There will be no big boom. It is heavily hampered by the LRT
              line. If give too many services, LRT may not be
              profitable. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688</p>
              <p>i did not miss the point smb128 is saying.  I understand.</p>
              <p>I took sbs 50 to Ang mo kio mrt, sbs 85 to khatib mrt and sbs 136 to Ang mo kio mrt few times and take note of time to reach red colour mrt line. </p>
              <p>Sbs 50-45 min </p>
              <p>sbs 85-38 min</p>
              <p>sbs 136- 1 hr 5 min. </p>
              <p>Sbs 50 time for whole of sengkang is 19 min. Not too bad. True sore point is sengkang area but then no choice. Taking public transport is like this. </p>
              <p>Few more months down the road, you will know. Nothing wrong with sbs 39, 168, 858, 969 stopping at TPE stop. </p>
              <p>Not saying whose fault is for the LRT. I also don't like LRT personally. But trying to be realistic. Once LRT is there, bus services will be restricted in a sense. Forcing people to take LRT to switch to mrt. Not many new bus services will be introduced. Just received news Punggol west LRT will be operational in mid 2014.</p>
              <p>I have said countless times I am not related to LTA or any govt services. I am tired of people linking me to LTA. It is up to you to believe or not as long as my conscience is clear and I am not telling any lies. </p>
              <p>You know why sbs 50 is a good service? It directly benefits me in many ways. I live in an area not near mrt. So sbs 50 brings me out of Punggol fast. I am 1 min away from sbs 50 bus stop. It brings me to rivervale mall (walking distance), sengkang mrt, sengkang west (swimming complex), fernvale point, yio Chu Kang road (near seletar) and Ang mo kio and bishan. No need transfer any more. So it is a very good service, ain't it?</p>
              <p>How about your area? Which new service benefits you? Look forward to hearing from you! Believe you to be a nice guy!!!</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, I understand your good intentions. But then no no. Sbs 83 is for residents in Punggol east. Sbs 119 is for Punggol west residents. Cannot combine. Sbs 119 will have its own catchment market in future because its sides of the residents are increasing. At the moment, Punggol residents will prefer mrt than sbs 119. Cheers. </p>

              <p>For number 2, unless u can give me a damn good seamless, transfer-free example (must apply to MAJORITY of Punggol residents) that only 168, and none of the other svcs I've mentioned could provide, otherwise I doubt 168 will stop there, due to service clashes, and its unworthy sacrifice of the many passengers from the east. </p>
              <p>3. Now I'm very suspicious of your position. How you know the opening of an LRT system that has been defunct for 11 years since it has finished construction? And furthermore how did you know about a new svc? Worse still you said there won't be a boom! </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, I understand your good intentions. But then no
              no. Sbs 83 is for residents in Punggol east. Sbs 119 is for Punggol
              west residents. Cannot combine. Sbs 119 will have its own catchment
              market in future because its sides of the residents are increasing.
              At the moment, Punggol residents will prefer mrt than sbs 119.
              Cheers. </p>

              <p>My dear sir. </p>
              <p>Taking public transport is not like this. </p>
              <p>HK bus routes fixtures beat SG hands down. </p>
              <p>It's all the shit LTA's fault for screwing buses up and also not maintaining its hub-and-spoke Method well too. Putting buses in such a lowly position... Fuck lah!</p>
