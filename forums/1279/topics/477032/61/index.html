              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I agree for sbs 518. Actually the frequency of
              this service is supposed to be in such a way as it brings residents
              from pasir ris, tampines and a portion of bedok to the city area
              all at one time. Its main aim is not to connect pasir ris to
              tampines or tampines to bedok. There are many other connections for
              bus services which serve pasir ris to tampines or tampines to bedok
              or pasir ris to bedok depending on where you are at (which part)
              and where you want to go (which part). Cheers.</p>

              <p>Lol lah, very little people will take within suburb area one for express... Unless the places only just nice have this svc to connect eg. PSR West Mall/Meridian JC to Temasek Poly... </p>
              <p>And the freq of 15 mins is absurd... Even for city to suburb... I mean just look at the crowd! Those who can't board the bus! And those who paid higher fares but have to squeeze (not a matter of standing here) on the bus for the entire express journey!</p>

              <p>I find it insulting that the only service to connect half of

              heartlands legitimately to the city can only deserve full SDs with
              a horrific 15 min freq for weekend, consequently and effectively
              leaving 30 over pax stranded at the MBS stop everytime a bus
              (actually all of them) leaves jam-packed every weekend evening,
              from 7.30 pm onwards. </p>
              <p>I don't bloody see WHY can 502 get DDs and boosted freq when its
              SDs are similarly filled like 518 before its improvement, and 518
              CAN'T. This is a matter of principle here. EXPECT people to give up
              cars to the city by charging exorbitant ERP charges and increasing
              parking fees, YET depriving them of their rights to travel to the
              city by public transport! And THEN charging them extra for the
              express service (which is the only fact to make travelling on PT
              &gt; car make sense), YET not providing them an express journey
              time as time taken to watch two buses zoom past already made it not
              that express!</p>
              <p>My ultimate wish is to see DDs on 518 and improved freq.
              Otherwise I hope two more AP SDs can be added to 518 during
              weekends. It will really help. <span> </span></p>

              the TP crowd board them (the buses normally come together), and
              normally, some will be left behind.</p>

              <p>DDs for 518 is still up to debate, I guess, cause sometimes, I

              <p>I don't think Sv 8 needs frequency improvement... What it needs is converting 2 SD slots into DD on priority. In the past, SBST gave massive upgrades to Sv 90 that runs in parallel until you hit Paya Lebar rd... This part is fine with existing fleet but loads beyond to Tampines can b v heavy especially on Temasek operating days.</p>

              <p>Personally, I would want the express bus services to be shorter, so that the travelling times can be shortened. However, I know this would only cause the fares to increase, since this would mean less people taking the bus service (low demand, high supply). So, yeah~ <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>Well, do not worry. The Quality of Service can be monitored and controlled regardless of feeder, trunk, express, or even night rider. LTA can simply collect data from the Ez-link card readers (from the satellite above that is connected to the readers) and see how long the bus takes to drive from point A to point B, and what time they arrive at the bus stops. Otherwise, it can send its people down to the bus stops to check whether or not the bus adheres to the schedule. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, I thought LTA is implementing a rewards/penalty system already? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, I am considered lucky compared with other commuters, since I can take 21/59 to SAFRA and walk to TP (my lessons are held close to TP East Gate). But when I feel lazy to walk, or don't feel like changing bus, I will take 518</p>
              <p>Normally I will take to Blk 302 to change to 8, but if a commuter use trunk service from (example) Pasir Ris West Plaza to TP, it will be 39 change to 8. But during 8am to 8.30am, it will be a miracle if you can even board 8 (or sometimes even 518). I once missed 3 VO and 1 KUB because the crowd there seems never ending!</p>
              <p>Oh, and 518 only stop at one stop in Bedok, which 23 (seems to be able to) cater to. It will be nice if 518 do stop at Bedok MRT on its return trip. Could even offload some pax from 69.</p>
              <p>Hmmmmm, should 8 be reverted back to its former Pasir Ris - Toa Payoh route? Or retain its current route?</p>

              <p>Are they even that "express" in the first place? 502 plies the express sector towards the city along Boon Lay Way/Commonwealth Ave West/Clementi Ave 2/Ulu Pandan Rd/Holland Rd/Napier Rd/Tanglin Rd instead of the scheduled PIE &gt; Stevens Rd &gt; Scotts Rd listed in bus directories. And Holland Rd is jam-packed during AM peak.</p>
              <p>Just make them basic while retaining their existing routes. Converting them to trunks also make them more attractive with lower payable fares.</p>
              <p>506 runs parallel to 985 between Jln Anak Bt &amp; Lor 2 Toa Payoh, but yet 1 is trunk &amp; 1 is express. Double standards as well? Shouldn't 985 be express as well?</p>

              If 985 express then 36,858,969,965,168,161,23 will follow suit but they cant. 506 can just renumbered it if they want to make it a trunk service. 
              
              The most important thing is what qualifies a service to be an express service? The service i named above also plies expressway also mah and i believe some are maybe longer than 502 and 506 route on the expressway.
              
              At least 951E,971E,850E,982E, qualifies as one coz not only it has the 'E' but it literally plies the expressway for a long distance just like 518.

              <p>MyBus used 3 Isuzu LT134P coaches today (1 with Liannex, 2 with
                  SC Chivalrous bodywork)</p>
              <p>Travel GSH used 3 Zhongtong Triumph LCK6660D minibus (with an
                  extra spare Zhongtong Cruise LCK6118H coach on standby). Chatted
                  with the staff, the reason why they deployed it is because of a
                  tight turn at one of the junctions and it also allows them to
                  complete the trip faster. 291P and 293P will be using full sized
                  buses.</p>

              <p>I believe that junction the staff was talking about for Sv 358P is the one from PSR Dr 4 into PSR St 41. A few hundred metres after that on the hill, there is a super big blind spot and the minibuses might be more apt there. While the reason the staff cited (that super tight turning) is valid, I'm still inclined the difference in demand between Sv 358P &amp; Sv 359P also played a part in the minibuses being used for 358P.</p>
              <p>Too good a frequency honestly when I see like 2x KUBs on Sv 359 and 1x Sv 359P Isuzu arriving at the St 11 bus stop within 20seconds of each other during AM Peak today, hahah. </p>

              <p>Idk why you semeed to have a problem with minibuses being deployed on Sv 358P though? Is it really that significant or important to have full-sized coaches on such a svc, when I had posted earlier that Sv 358P's demand is way lower than Sv 359P + the tight junction along the route?<br></p>

              <p>Pardon me, but why are some of us here seemingly so obsessed with whether Sv 518 needs a BSEP add? Doesn't a non-BSEP fleet add do the same job too? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"><br><br>Furthermore, a non-BSEP fleet add could be a full-day bus somemore.

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If we're talking about BSEP, that restricts it to only Citaros. I wouldn't mind if Sv 518 gets an additional KUB though, as long as they kope from those that had their gearboxes tuned somewhat previously (eg those perm Sv 36). </span></p>
