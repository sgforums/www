              <p>Depends on how  Punggol North develops. West and east already have LRT. I am sure there will be a feeder from  Punggol to areas in Punggol north, may be terminating at  Punggol Matilda.</p>

                  yes i agree long routes but should be semi-express only stopping at a few major points for pax to make transfers. or else the bus schedule may get screwed up by traffic jams etc. But a route from BNL to PSR may be counterproductive as pax may still prefer EW mrt which is faster. also PIE often get traffic jams caused by busy traffic or accidents. A long semi-express route should act as short cut to MRT. if run parallel to MRT i think would fail.

                  yes; i fully agree. look at the old Express 501 and 502 back in the 2000s for eg. they were wonderful routes and i often took 502 from BNL all the way to HG which was so convenient. i hope LTA start re-focus on this with the additional 450 BSEP buses. This long semi express bus concept is similar to the future cross-island mrt line which our govt is thinking whether to build another pair of tracks for semi-express trains. But semi-express buses are more flexible than rail and provide better doorstep connections. and since LTA is spending tons of $$$ on roads and expressways, why dont they build a separate 1.5 lane wide bus ways along busy expressways for public buses,police,emergency vehicles only? traffic jam bus also kena jam which should not be.

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, need erect some new bus stops along st 91 and definitely one opposite hougang 1 mall at st 91 before turning into hougang ave 9. Saw heavy crowds from hougang int taking sbs 116 and alighting at hougang ave 9 to go to the mall. Think the market for this direct connection is there! Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, they have already extended funding for more BSEP buses so naturally with more buses, depots must come and so lands must be tendered and then cleared for the buses to park. This is a very natural process and it will take time. Maybe even years. I suppose they will fund those bus interchanges at towns mentioned above and they will stop after all these. Because of the impending MRT lines which will be up from Yr 2015 till Yr 2030. The main mode of transport is still MRT. Buses will always only complement those areas not served. Cheers. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I feel that SBS Transit is now more of a bus operator, instead of the company it seemed to be previously. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SBS Transit now only focus on bus service, on how to operate them and how to improve them. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">All the campaigns and so on are now done by LTA and the government.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If anyone notices, SBS Transit now hardly (or never really) introduce its own company campaign (eg. <a title="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx</a>) like in the past. Ever since the Government intervened, SBS Transit's quality of bus services has improved. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For instance, the waiting time for buses and crowding level of buses are now, to some extent, reduced. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that SMRT is gradually returning back to its former self - during the Singapore MRT Ltd days &amp; during the Trans-Island Buses days. In other words, the quality in all aspects of SMRT has improved and is improving further. In terms of technology, SMRT will soon catch up with SBS Transit, as it is currently implementing all the technology that SBS Transit implemented before the government intervened. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When SMRT's first batch of Double Decker buses enters service by 2016, along with the technology that would all implemented by then, I am sure SMRT will be on par with SBS Transit. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>As the government introduces more bus services in SMRT areas via the BSEP, I guess this would increase SMRT's share in the public bus services industry and reduce SBS Transit's share, such that both shares will eventually equalise at 50%-50%. This will cease SBS Transit's monoploy status. Along with SMRT catching up in technology and having Double Decker buses in its fleet, t<span style="line-height: 1.231;">here is finally going to be real competition between the two Public Transport Operators! </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Thereafter, when everything is equal (except number of services and buses) in both Public Bus Operators, I guess the Government will say that whatever SBS Transit and SMRT have in common (by that time) is the standard that a Public Transport Operator must have.</p>
              <p>When the standard (eg. must have a prescribed list of technology, must have at least how much proportion of Double Decker buses, etc.) is set, I guess the Government will then open up the Public Bus Industry and invite other bus operators to become Public Bus Operator in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So... to some extent, the government is helping SMRT improve and be on par with SBS Transit, while it pause SBS Transit's improvement (in non-services areas). Personally, in my opinion, I feel that it is only because the government intervenes that's why SMRT implements the tracking system in its buses, introduces Double Decker buses, etc.  Somehow, I feel that SMRT is right now being SBSTransit-nalised (becoming similar to SBS Transit). Eventually, SMRT will be so identical to SBS Transit that the only difference is just in the logo, livery, colours schemes (in buses) and the uniform that the staff wears. </p>
              <p>By then, when things become so identical, LTA will most likely say that this is the standard that Public Bus Operators must have, in order for them to get their license to operate public bus services, or have their license renewed thereafter.</p>
              <p>By then, there will be many depots (right now, I think there is only the one at Bulim) and interchanges (I think the one at Joo Koon is developed and owned by LTA) built by LTA and leased to Public Bus Operators. Whereas for the ones owned by the respective Public Bus Operators, LTA will probably take over them and be the new owner of them, then lease them to Public Bus Operators. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">By then, I doubt any Public Bus Operator would have the luxury of leasing an entire bus depot/interchange. Most likely one bus depot/interchange will be used by several Public Bus Operators, and every Public Bus Operator can only lease parking lots, based on how many bus routes it operates from the facility. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Meanwhile, there will surely be excess buses that would not have space in the depot/interchanges, if LTA takes over them and lease them to several operators. I guess the government will either make it compulsory for every Public Bus Operator to come up with their own money to buy land to build their own parking space to park their buses, or (since land is scarce) LTA will itself build one multi-storey storage building at every of the four districts (north, south, east, west) of Singapore for storing of buses, and make it compulsory for every Public Bus Operator to rent the bus storage spaces at the buildings - the proportion of storage space allocated in every storage building would be based on the proportion of the PTO share in bus services in the district the building is in. Somehow, I think many people will complain and criticize if government chooses to do the second option, because many people will say that the government waste money build the multi-storey bus storage buildings - unless the government can justify that the rent it forced out of PTOs actually can make profits after a certain number of years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just in case suddenly no buses are deployed, the government would probably make it a must that the bus storage buildings/spaces in total must have the provision of accommodating a certain number of Public Bus Operators. </span></p>
              <p>By then, when the two Public Bus Operators become so identical, all the infrastructure required for public bus services is owned by the government, and all the provision of bus storage infrastructure required are there, I guess the government will then open up the Public Bus Services Industry and invite the Private bus operators to become Public Bus Operators, and Public Bus Operators from other countries to come to Singapore and be Public Bus Operators here.</p>
              <p>By then, there will be a great competition among the Public Bus Operators in the Public Bus Services industry. The government will set the standards and regulate/control the industry, while the Public Bus Operators compete among themselves to remain in competition and avoid being replaced by other Public Bus Operators. In other words, by then, the Public Bus Services industry will be based on Contracts model. </p>

              Also, can we pay using EZ-Link card or is it cash only?
              
              OT: WTS should be allowed a proper PTO license, given that they have such a modern-looking fleet among the private charter operators.
