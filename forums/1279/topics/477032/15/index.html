                  u see; nowadays more and more rail commuters are affected by the rail disruptions and 1 disruption is going to affect thousands of people. and as times goes by and people are not given more direct bus routes as alternative; more and more people will get fed up. buy car price so high. take public transport kena this. 
                  come next election see what happens....if LTA is still not going to wake up and the ministers are still behaving like armchair ministers.

              <p>Hi mr busAnalyser, your idea of filling up the bus is good but then this defeats the idea of the initial decision of connecting orchard road and CGA by sbs 36. At the time of introduction, this was meant as a fast connection. Then the idea was slightly tweaked to include marine parade residents to CGA to beef up the passenger load of sbs 36 to make it sort of semi-express. With your new idea, you abandon both objectives which i believe should not be so. For svs 36 and 48, let it be status quo. If the peak at tanah merah towards bedok south and marine parade is very high, this shows the possibility of introducing new service. We cannot always harbour the idea of changing other services drastically to alleviate a new peak situation. </p>

                              bro; i agree LTA should not be too involved in PT matters and since their organisation is mainly consist of armchair scholars and officials who dont understand the real situation of our PT and start implementing senseless policies and directions- eg bus and hub model, setting target of 40 new BSEP bus routes, introduce 3rd bus operator, reward scheme for good bus service performance wheras the real situation of delay is mainly the traffic jams! PT havnt get in order and still keep increase population drastically. what the heck set a target of 40 new bus routes and the "karkias" blindly follow to make sure target is set? therefore they become restricted and cant intro more direct cross-country routes? Bus-stop maintenance contract got so many different parties involved which is really stupid and inefficient. who the idiot intro Mandatory Give Way to buses at bus-stop scheme? almost all motorists dont give way and yet waste tax payers $$ to paint the roads. yet they dare to wayang and say very efficient. intro 3rd bus operator will LTA dare guarantee service standard will improve? if the PTOs no longer achieve economy of scale to operate and costs rises, will LTA bear responsibility? LTA should just remain as regulatory body to ensure PTOs perform.

              <p>Bro , i already suggested for 10S(3 Special trips from Kent Ridge to Bedok South in the morning to cater to heavy boarding twds city), was shot down straight<br><br>I feedbacked for BSEP 6351Z(from Tampines Int) to move away from 0815hrs(mountbatten Rd arrival) to either earlier or later and deploy a DD to cover that slot, was shot down immediately when 6351Z was introduced, you know how heavily packed the sv10 was daily. SBS6351Z was finally moved to a much later departure from Tampines only recently. The most rubbish thing is there will be another sv10 DD following 6351Z daily...<br><br>sv196 evening peak from Clementi to BDK, 1745hrs to 1905hrs. buses come at 10 - 12mins interval still packed. After 1915grs, 2 to 3 sv196comes together and this is a daily occurrence, been like this for the past 3 years...<br><br>SG PTOs are unlike HK, KMB, CTB, NWFB runs empty down trips daily, eg cross harbour 9XX routes, empty bus starts service at Southorn Playground(Hennessy Rd) daily...<br><br>So far in SG, i onli see sv190 downtrip at YMCA daily evening peak for 4 - 5buses... 858 is suffering, 966 is overloaded with empty buses, there is a mis allocation of resources...<br><br>I always invite LTA officials to come view the ground situation WITH ME when i have problems boarding the bus, they will ignore this and give me standard answer. bus is only 70% utilised... if you do not take into a passenger's bags, weight and refusal to move in, the reasons given are all baloney!<br><br>You talk about jams, paterson rd, every evening jam, sv5,14,16,65 everyday lambat, LTA still keep quiet.<br><br>sv75,167,196 and premium svcs that use cantonment rd in the morning, evening with heavy traffic, LTA is STILL NOT doing anything, so what is LTA doing?~!<br><br>Close to 50 svcs utilise Fullerton Bay hotel bus stop at Clifford Pier and buses sometimes queue up to 10mins just to get to the bus stop because LTA shifted the bus stop further down so that old Clifford Pier is not blocked, worse, cars, taxis, trucks use this lane to get to the hotel , been talking to them to LTA about this for more than 2 years and still no solution...<br>You can see the level of productivity in government agencies and the dragging of feet when they do things...<br> <br>I am waiting for user dupdup77 to comment on all this if he turns up again at this forum...<br><br>Now you know why productivity in SG never goes up...</p>

              <p>BSRF pick SMRT buses except for 858(reliability issues) for the start just for show, they have yet to pick SBST routes...<br><br>sv858 is a cruncher for daily commuters using yet LTA/SMRT still sitting on it and not doing the appropriate, instead LTA is trumpeting its introduction of new bus routes, some of them are really duplicating existing bus routes, eg 120...<br><br>sv190 already has a high freq but still packed. Why?! gahmen buy rigid 2 axle... Who in the right frame of mind will do that when population target is 6.9m? Shows and expose that gahmen departments are not collaborating and each is doing their own thing...<br><br>CGA buses should use 3 axle rigid if bendy(length)/DD(height) is not able to handle, how come gahmen din consider buying?!<br><br>BSEP is supposed to be WAB vehicles based on the purchases by 
              SBST(Citaros/WEG IIs), SMRT(MAN A22), then why are the City Direct buses
               65x series used by private operators NOT WAB compliant?!<br><br>BSRF is not appropriate for Singapore with its big car population... gahmen is again contradicting its own policies<br><br>In order to get more people to public transport, there should be adequate buses(capacity wise in the likes of bendy/DDs) on the roads, if not, who with a car or intend to buy a car will migrate to public transport to work as an option?!<br><br>If the gahmen is sincere in getting Singaporeans to use public transport(particularly buses), they should implement FULL BUS lanes throughout SG, not half baked ideas as partial bus lanes(red/yellow broken lines) which serves no purpose...</p>

              <p>BSRF pick SMRT buses except for 858(reliability issues) for the
              start just for show, they have yet to pick SBST routes...<br> <br> sv858 is a cruncher for daily commuters using yet LTA/SMRT still
              sitting on it and not doing the appropriate, instead LTA is
              trumpeting its introduction of new bus routes, some of them are
              really duplicating existing bus routes, eg 120...<br> <br> sv190 already has a high freq but still packed. Why?! gahmen buy
              rigid 2 axle... Who in the right frame of mind will do that when
              population target is 6.9m? Shows and expose that gahmen departments
              are not collaborating and each is doing their own thing...<br> <br> CGA buses should use 3 axle rigid if bendy(length)/DD(height) is
              not able to handle, how come gahmen din consider buying?!<br> <br> BSEP is supposed to be WAB vehicles based on the purchases by
              SBST(Citaros/WEG IIs), SMRT(MAN A22), then why are the City Direct
              buses 65x series used by private operators NOT WAB
              compliant?!<br> <br> BSRF is not appropriate for Singapore with its big car
              population... gahmen is again contradicting its own policies<br> <br> In order to get more people to public transport, there should be
              adequate buses(capacity wise in the likes of bendy/DDs) on the
              roads, if not, who with a car or intend to buy a car will migrate
              to public transport to work as an option?!<br> <br> If the gahmen is sincere in getting Singaporeans to use public
              transport(particularly buses), they should implement FULL BUS lanes
              throughout SG, not half baked ideas as partial bus lanes(red/yellow
              broken lines) which serves no purpose...</p>

              <p>120 is ... and they modified 124 to serve telok blangah residents to HarbourFront.</p>
              <p>then why introduce 120 in the first place?</p>
              <p>858 could get some bendies but plenty of problems. it is stuck. by comparison, 27 fared well with the full fleet KUBs and later full fleet taros. 27 needs a SWT with DDs.</p>
              <p>there is the sole unit SBS997A which is a 14.5m 3 axle B10M MkIII, though it was scrapped.</p>

              <p>They should have a Townlink connecting Telok Blangah Heights to Redhill Est, Rumah Tinggi(not existing SBST145) to REDHILL station rather than getting people in Rumah Tinggi to take 63 to Tiong Bahru for train unless people dun mind walking...<br><br>Furthermore, people at Redhill Close used to have SBS41(withdrawn and merged with 197), now they have to trudge to Redhill distance with NO COVERED walkway, damn cham... <br><br>I wonder if LTA bus planning folks actually go down to see the situation?! From their replies, it is straight forward to me that they reply on passenger loading data from computer rather than go down to observe/recce... tt is real sad from CHIEF TRANSPORT planner in SG<br><br>SBS997A is a relic, solely built for SBS/SBST, bus too long dunnoe for wat? enter guinness book of records as Asia's longest bus(rear ad)<br><br>Volvo,MAN,Citaro already have 3 axle rigids running in EUR, taken them before... Salzburg rt. 25 runs at 20mins freq and ths 3 axle bus is able to pack everyone in comfortably.<br><br>The bus has bus stop information display in TV screen format that displays information about the route, next bus stop and attractions at the next stop and it is a public bus, not tour bus...<br><br>Where is LTA's bus stop information display on its buses?! It is quite sad that Singapore as a modern city does not even offer this basic information...</p>
