              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, in actual fact there is no point to route sbs 116. What I have suggested is to route sbs 116 slightly from hougang ave 4 to go hougang st 91 then back to hougang ave 9. As for hougang st 51, leave it alone. Since inner streets are important as well, there is actually not much issue to divert sbs 109 inwards. It also gives st 51 people linkage to sengkang mrt. I do not see anything wrong in giving them another trunk service. Everywhere around, there are some other roads having 1 or 2 trunk services. In any way, for long trunk services, people are no longer taking from end to end. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, why not possible a new loop service for Redhill close? There is nothing wrong with that. If there are places to be further enhanced, it suits the possibility of BSEP. Please keep an open mind about it. I know you don't like the idea of more bus services to some unfavoured locations but there is a need to enhance many areas.</p>

              <p>To further add on, the current route of sbs 109 is about 22km. Some of that distance about 5.8km is covered on TPE which helps to cut travelling time for some people. To re-route it slightly to hougang st 51 then back onto buangkok green will also help create some new links which should be greatly welcome by residents there. It also benefits some more people from walking to buangkok green to take sbs 109. So I see more advantages than disadvantages. Come to think of it, it is an out of the box idea. But anyway I think the authorities will not approve it. Period. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, to further clarify, I think you may have misunderstood my initial suggestions for sbs 116 and sbs 109. What I suggest initially is to minimize a lot of inconvenience. That is why I write sbs 116 to incur additional 3 minutes to left turn in hougang ave 4 to hougang st 91 to ave 9 then on its normal route to serangoon. For sbs 109, to incur 3 minutes right turn in hougang ave 4 to hougang st 51 back to buangkok green on its journey to sengkang east road. Like this, give each street a trunk service and also do not affect much of its original route and most importantly benefit more residents there. In this way, there is really no need for 1 bus service sbs 116 to be amended drastically to ply st 51, 91, 93. Cheers.</p>

              <p>There is one difference between Sv 4 and alps service... Alps service will be like JIS. Sv 4 has bi directional loading. In fact, I think in a few months more LTA will add one more bus to Sv 4. Already at a 8-10 min frequency, bus is getting 40/45 pax at interchange itself (unlike 116 that gets only 15/20 pax at int and looping point).</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, this should provide a win-win situation for st 91 and st 51 and also cause much less disruption. Meanwhile st 51 residents will have a doorstep service to other places such as sengkang east and pasir ris provided by sbs 109 instead of the same old places which will be duplicated by services 116 and 101 both hougang and serangoon services although albeit different routes. Right? </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, this should provide a win-win situation for

              51 residents will have a doorstep service to other places such as
              sengkang east and pasir ris provided by sbs 109 instead of the same
              old places which will be duplicated by services 116 and 101 both
              hougang and serangoon services although albeit different routes.

              <p>As I said re-routing 109 is a strict no. 101 bi directional on st 51. 116 goes HG ave 9 -- st 91 (2stops)-- HG ave 4. On return will do HG ave 4 -- st 91 (one stop) -- st 93 (one stop -  faster MRT connectivity compared to long winding 325), Buangkok Green, YCK road, Serangoon North Ave 4 (this is important as I don't think there is a right turn from HG st 91 to HG ave 9)</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, if best can don't touch sbs 109. But then to turn in st 51 is not causing much inconvenience. Straight after st 51 is out to buangkok green and sengkang east. Hougang ave 4 and buangkok green residents for the affected sectors are still within walking distance to st 51. They can still walk a bit and hop into sbs 109. This sort of thing is hard to avoid if a service is needed to go to inner routes. But usually inner routes are still less than 400 metres to main road. Furthermore, ave 4 residents still have sbs 88, 159, 161 to sengkang. Buangkok green residents have 43. 156, 159, 161 to sengkang. Not too bad if sbs 109 is re-routed to go inside at 51. What do you think?</p>

              <p>There is one difference between Sv 4 and alps service... Alps
              service will be like JIS. Sv 4 has bi directional loading. In fact,
              I think in a few months more LTA will add one more bus to Sv 4.
              Already at a 8-10 min frequency, bus is getting 40/45 pax at
              interchange itself (unlike 116 that gets only 15/20 pax at int and
              looping point).</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, the loading at interchange is different because sbs 4 is only service to the required destination whereas for sbs 116, there are other services like sbs 72 and mrt as competing services plus other bus services fighting for passengers to certain locations. Thus this is expected. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, because initially mr BusAnalyser suggests to re-route sbs 116 to hougang st 51, 91, 93. I find it not very suitable because sbs 116 will miss out on hougang ave 4 to hougang ave 9 which is more direct. So to avoid such a major route change to sbs 116, why not sbs 116 is amended slightly to cover st 91 then another service sbs 109 is amended slightly to st 51. This will cause less disruption. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, this is also why sbs 83 does not go inside compassvale crescent and only plies compassvale st. Plus why no buses go to edgedale plains and sbs 3, 83 go 1 big round (Punggol field, east, then central). Those residents at edgedale plains in middle of Punggol field and central have to walk to either set of bus stops there as it is still within walking distance. Cheers.</p>

                          Worth exploring. Cheers. </p>

              <p>I think this extension will be a huge hit because it will lessen the loads of the Sengkang East LRT, lessen the loads of Sv 62 during school hours and off peak hours (towards Punggol Int) and of course give upper serangoon view residents a easy option to commute). </p>
              <p>I predict in the near future when the BTO flats and condos are ready, If 113 is extended to Sengkang Int, there will be long queues forming and DDs will be deployed. I have emailed this suggestion to LTA. </p>
