              shuttle bus that will ferry them there for $1 per trip.</p>
              <p>It will ply the route between Tampines Street 32 and 33, near Ngee 
              Ann Secondary School; and Tampines Street 11, where both the Tampines

              <p>The bus will stop eight times along the route, including outside the 
              Tampines Interchange. Payment must be made with an ez-link card.</p>
              <p>The shuttle service, run by private operator Republic Express, will

              <p>I agree. That's why I think LTA planning is ridiculous. All they want yo do is show people statistics without really making relevant changes. What's the use of a Sv 18? Divert it to areas to relieve load on other services than simply copy Sv 8 from Safra that already has good frequency and DDs. </p>
              <p>LTA has not made one significant change to existing services whose loading pattern has changed after MRT lines. They don't see but soon there is going to be a chaos with so many buses on roads.</p>

              <p>MR
                   SAMUEL Ng's letter ("One gap LTA should've plugged"; Monday) mentioned 
                  that the Land Transport Authority shot down calls for a shuttle bus 
                  service in Tampines because it was "not viable".</p>
              <p>This is akin to the situation in the Kranji countryside.</p>
              <p>I have given feedback to the transport authorities about how the 
                  community of farmers and farm employees in the Kranji countryside has 
                  been neglected. There is no public bus service to the farms, and members
                   of the Kranji Countryside Association have been paying for a private 
                  shuttle service for almost 10 years.</p>
              <p>Each time we make an appeal to the LTA or Transport Ministry for 
                  support of the service, the reply is that the Government cannot offer 
                  backing as the service is "not viable". I have stressed repeatedly that 
                  the farmers are not asking for a full subsidy or even a full-service 
                  public bus. We are happy to fund part of the service, which needs only 
                  to be a minibus operating at 11/2-hour intervals.</p>
              <p>Farms, visitors and the Government should all chip in to make this 
                  service viable and useful for the farming community in Kranji.</p>
              <p>With the rising costs of doing businesses, farmers are facing 
                  increasing pressure to sustain the expensive private shuttle service.</p>
              <p>The LTA should not assess appeals based simply on financial 
                  viability. Special communities - such as elderly folk in Tampines, needy
                   Singaporeans and even poor foreigners - should be supported based on 
                  need.</p>
