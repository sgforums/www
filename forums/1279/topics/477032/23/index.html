              <p>Response in <span style="color: #ff0000;">red.</span></p>
              <p>some of the new routes that i propose under BSEP</p>
              <p>1)CCK int to CCK ave 6 area there (For new BTO flats) or maybe
              300 may extend(which i dun think so coz the route quite long)
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">No brainer. Need this service. A
              must! Can also be extended to Sungei Kadut Loop/Crescent,
              completely ignored by LTA/SMRT. Complete no-no for extension of
              300. It has too much of its load to manage, and I would not want it
              to get into any scheduling mess.</span></p>
              <p>2)Punggol to seletar aerospace park (i think wait till the
              flyover &amp; the new roads there finish then can have new service
              perhaps? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, this could be an option
              via Senthul, Punggol west, but the question is that does Seletar
              aerospace have that many pax still working there? Is there going to
              be more industrial development? Else a feeder in Punggol west will
              definitely come up in future.</span></p>
              <p>3)Sembawang shld have a new route too. anyone wants to comment
              on this? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sembawang will have many new
              routes. It needs to have one to Canberra Square, trunk services to
              Tampines/UEC and trunk service to BBT/JE. I would also recommend
              that sv 39 be extended here. I would prefer if one of trunk
              services to east goes via Yishun Ave 7 and 6 to Yishun Ave 1 and
              then to Seletar Aerospace, Punggol and then Tampines.</span></p>
              <p>4)Bukit batok to bukit batok west ave 8 (end) there (since got
              new school dulwich college, which is 60% complete &amp; new BTO
              flats propose there beside it) <span style="color: #ff0000;">As per
              town maps, lot of new avenues to be build between BBT West Ave 2
              and BBT Road. Hence, can also have one trunk service from CCK to
              Clementi go via BBT Road, CCK Ave 5 extension.</span></p>

              <p>for 1), i hope it goes to cck ave 3 &gt; cck way &gt; turn right to ave 1 then to ave 6/7. at least serve south view &amp; keat hong LRT</p>
              <p>for 4), by the time dulwich college &amp; maybe BTO flats ready, obviously 160 &amp; 180 confirm cmi haha. the bukit batok west ave 8 (end) there near MI is already flattened. so maybe new roads very soon</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B</p>
              <p>2. 6 months estimated down the road, the bus stop will be
              operational. Then all numbers will be shown. Now only
              prediction.</p>
              <p>3. It is okay. Bus services increase yes. But not big boom.
              Restricted by West LRT. News state new bus services to punggol may
              come end of yr 2014. </p>
              <p>4. The only sensible reason I can think of is sbs 27 (other than
              sbs 96 and sbs 179) has one of the super highest frequencies. So
              they may think that passengers should be able to get onto sbs 27 or
              sbs 27A no matter how crowded it can get. Even if 1 bus is missed,
              there is no big issue to get to the 2nd bus.</p>
              <p>Yes from sengkang side, mrt to bishan via transfers is much
              faster. Cheers. </p>

              <p>2. Erm okay</p>
              <p>3. Big boom as in 2-3 svcs. How about that?</p>
              <p>4. That's the problem with LTA. Trust me it's not pleasant to squish on a KUB from Sengkang all the way to Tampines. And sometimes when they bunch you wait 20 mins for a bus!! Peak somemore!!</p>

              <p>The new flats at the former Keat Hong Camp definitely need new routes. Maybe 300 can be split up into two svcs, one serving ave 2/3 and another serving ave 4/5 and possibly other new roads there, though this removes the connection between the schs and flats and ave 4 and ave 2. Or svc 300 skip ave 5 and have another svc going there all the way to keat hong close and/or ave 6. Also would be nice to see a route linking that area to ITE College West and Bukit Panjang, going by the main roads CCK Ave 3 and Brickland Rd.</p>
              <p>There may be quite a number of new svcs in CCK when the whole of the former keat hong camp is developed, and i wonder how they're going to find so much space at CCK Int for new svcs. Maybe can kick out Qian Hu shuttle, shift the MRT breakdown shuttles to an additional 4th lane outside (since that space is empty most of the time), merge 188E/R lane with 188 and merge NR3 with a day service like 925.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I find it quite disturbing that Premium svcs cost so much more than express/fast forward/city direct svcs, especially since some of the routes are quite similar, and there is nothing really "premium" or high quality about the svcs other than the no standing allowed, which is quite stupid anyway since ppl wouldn't mind standing for a ride rather than missing the bus, if it's already full.</p>
              <p>IMO standing should be allowed and fares should be lowered to express fares, or at least closer that level. Either that or really go all out to provide "premium" service with extras like more comfy seats, free newspaper etc, though i'm not sure if ppl will pay for that.</p>
              <p>Would be good if some of the really high demand express/city direct svcs can have full day variants, e.g. 850E, 951E, that serve additional stops and charge normal trunk fares. Similar to how 971E now has 972.</p>

              <p><br>Premium services made a lot of sense before 850E, 951E kind of services were introduced. On SBST side, premium services have mostly DD buses deployed with good almost full seating. It is surprising SBST has not introduced any premium service since BSEP. May be now LTA does not allow and only wants to bring in cheaper E services.</p>

              <p>The new flats at the former Keat Hong Camp definitely need new
              routes. Maybe 300 can be split up into two svcs, one serving ave
              2/3 and another serving ave 4/5 and possibly other new roads there,
              though this removes the connection between the schs and flats and
              ave 4 and ave 2. Or svc 300 skip ave 5 and have another svc going
              there all the way to keat hong close and/or ave 6. Also would be
              nice to see a route linking that area to ITE College West and Bukit
              Panjang, going by the main roads CCK Ave 3 and Brickland Rd.</p>
              <p>There may be quite a number of new svcs in CCK when the whole of
              the former keat hong camp is developed, and i wonder how they're
              going to find so much space at CCK Int for new svcs. Maybe can kick
              out Qian Hu shuttle, shift the MRT breakdown shuttles to an
              additional 4th lane outside (since that space is empty most of the
              time), merge 188E/R lane with 188 and merge NR3 with a day service

              <p>My point, Ah Premium differs from Express/ffw services... <br><br>Premium is to serve housing estate than express DIRECT to Shenton Way via expressway<br><br>Express/ffw serve housing estate will hit city area ie Orchard/CBD area before hitting Shenton Way... <br>But my logic a bit flawed coz LTA introduce Express513/982E does not follow above criteria... <br><br>The 850E/951E is supposed to run parrallel to MRT lines during peak as an alternative to get to city, so keep the public quiet on how come train crowded, no alternative to city...<br><br>Secondly, SGreans wen kena interview always say "I don't mind paying a bit more to have a comfortable ride to town" so basing on this logic, LTA introduce these "express"/City Direct services which charge more rather than continue to introduce more Scheme B buses or trunk routes at NORMAL fares.<br><br>OT a bit, in HK, Express buses like CTB 5X charge same fare as normal CTB 5...<br><br>IN Barcelona, 65 from El Prat to Place Espana is the full trunk route while 165 is the express version(something like our ffw), both at the same price...<br><br>Taken both 65/165 before...

              <p>852 does not need. It mirrors the route of 74 from Bukit Timah to AMK Ave 6. It has 66, 174 in parallel until Adam Road junction. It has 157 in parallel until Macritchie.

              <p><br>What kind of transfers are you referring to? Regarding 851, I have already stated, need high capacity bus addition or conversion of rigid to high capacity.</p>

              <p>No, as I said, it is a backup service. Even if 852 is withdrawn,
              it will not make a huge impact to anyone. Just a few more buses
              need to be added on 74 and 851. </p>

              <p>apparently LTA/PTC does not think so.. that why they did not even allow 852 to be shortened to AMDEP.....</p>
