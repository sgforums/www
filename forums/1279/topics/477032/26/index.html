              <p>To add on, the 2 pandan gardens bus stop only have sbs 51 and sbs 143. To take buses to jurong town hall road and west coast road and expect residents to always walk in to the inner parts of pandan gardens is not practical la. For your info, no sbs 39 plies there. If you mean sbs 79, sbs 79 does not go to the bus stop near pandan gardens portion of west coast road. It goes to west coast road nearby teban garden side. Cheers</p>

Please take and let me know how many people board at Pandan Garden bus stops and alignt at Teban Gardens? Maybe 1 or 2...

              <p>Hi mr bus Analyser, initially sbs 241 a feeder service links the 2 estates. Withdrawn due to lack of people to warrant a feeder service. But the linkage was deemed still necessary even if there is just a minority. Thus with closure of teban gardens terminal, sbs 143 was re-routed to serve the link between the 2. Main aim is to connect the 2. For those going JE from pandan, take sbs 51. For those going teban from pandan, take sbs 143. No more 241. This is different from other bigger towns. New bus services are all plying inner routes to relieve people from walking. Examples are sbs 371, 120, 121, 141. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, now the trend is into introducing bus services to connect all these inner routes. Sbs 143 is functioning well, albeit a slightly longer journey. Bus services are there to provide more convenience. Some people will have it at their doorsteps and some within walking distances. In overall view of the public transport situation at these 2 estates, it is deemed okay to give pandan garden residents 2 doorstep services, sbs 51 and sbs 143. </p>

              <p>We just have different ways of seeing things... To me trunk routes have to be fast... Can't act like feeders... Long winding routes in today's day and age do not work... so you agree with me that 30 in one way can be an option right? So at least do that.. And spare time for people in the other direction. How 30 gets Teban connection in one direction but while going towards Bedok refuses to enter Teban? Why is it providing a one way link only?  Some routes are historically flawed and suited the demands then but not today.</p>

              <p>There were two other valid suggestions to LTa which also got ignored. 135 to ply Haig road instead of Tanjong Katong... You already have 43/76 in parallel... 4 new stops on Haig road provide direct connectivity. It does not upset pax also.</p>
              <p>another example. Swapping the route of 100 and 145 at Harbourfront. 100 cannot use DDs Booz of Upp Aljunied, 145 cannot coz of Henderson rd. Swapping the route would gave made it possible yo ply DDs on one of these routes. But adamant LTA will not do it even if it benefits the majority. Just go adding buses and make people stand on 100 and 145.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, they do not do major restructuring of bus routes like swapping of sbs 100 and sbs 145 at certain points which bring about major inconvenience to most. What they will do is to take note of the heavy sectors of both services and introduce new services to ply along certain segments and defray some crowds after they feel it warrants a new service. As you should know by now, more new services will be introduced all around the island for more direct routes, with 1st priority to connect new estates and 2nd priority to connect less well-connected roads (either with no buses or only few services) which is one of your favourites. </p>

              <p>LTA needs to wake up.  </p>
              <p>Swapping routes etc can be found commonly in other countries when they do their turn of bus rationalisation. So why does LTA has to be so stagnant and afraid to make change?</p>
              <p>That being said, I don't see any logical reasons for swapping 100 and 145. I'll leave it to the concerned to further justify. </p>
              <p>As for bus routes being too much a feeder, what I hoped LTA will do is to get smart and reorganise all its bus routes. Svcs like 7, 14, 48, 67, 97, 175 and 195 are really shames of the entire bus system in Singapore. It really is funny that a bus svc, that is supposed to directly connect to the city where MRT transfers will be tedious, will go ROUND AND ROUND small streets and towns!! Svc like 38, 98, 112 should be the ones doing that instead, alongside its feeders and Townlinks/Intratowns. </p>
              <p>In fact, don't you realise LTA has been going back on their words?? While they are saying hub and spoke, they actually get their trunks to go round and round, completely defeating its purpose to bring people from one place to another! And now they only regarded the MRT as the "hub". But didn't they say something about bus being supplements of MRT lines in the case of an emergency? Well, imagine now a train broke down at Sengkang station. The closest you have to the CBD is bus 80, which goes round and round towns! I'm neglecting bus shuttle just to prove the contradictions LTA have to you. </p>
              <p>And so how are you gonna expect car owners to give up cars? Yes you may say having trunks go to towns are better as they have direct connection instead of transferring feeders to town centres, but you see, if the trunks are so slow <strong>will they even take it in the first place? </strong>Does it even make a difference?</p>
              <p>Damn fail lah LTA. Everytime hear that disgusting rally of LHL really make me wanna puke. Want good for the people? Get your asses on the ground first lah. Car? So expensive. Train? So unreliable, and freq/train length so cui. Bus? Long-winded and crowded. Taxi? Choosy drivers, limited taxis, endless additional charges. Bike? Limiter bicycle lanes, cycle on pedestrian road will kena. So what expect us WALK 10+km to work ah? Wow what efficient workforce and economy there uh? LTA enough is enough hor, one day you really drive us to the corner alr ah, wait till we vote for opposition then you know!</p>

              <p>LTA needs to wake up.  </p>
              <p>Swapping routes etc can be found commonly in other countries
              when they do their turn of bus rationalisation. So why does LTA has
              to be so stagnant and afraid to make change?</p>
              <p>That being said, I don't see any logical reasons for swapping
              100 and 145. I'll leave it to the concerned to further
              justify. </p>
              <p>As for bus routes being too much a feeder, what I hoped LTA will
              do is to get smart and reorganise all its bus routes. Svcs like 7,
              14, 48, 67, 97, 175 and 195 are really shames of the entire bus
              system in Singapore. It really is funny that a bus svc, that is
              supposed to directly connect to the city where MRT transfers will
              be tedious, will go ROUND AND ROUND small streets and towns!! Svc
              like 38, 98, 112 should be the ones doing that instead, alongside
              its feeders and Townlinks/Intratowns. </p>
              <p>In fact, don't you realise LTA has been going back on their
              words?? While they are saying hub and spoke, they actually get
              their trunks to go round and round, completely defeating its
              purpose to bring people from one place to another! And now they
              only regarded the MRT as the "hub". But didn't they say something
              about bus being supplements of MRT lines in the case of an
              emergency? Well, imagine now a train broke down at Sengkang
              station. The closest you have to the CBD is bus 80, which goes
              round and round towns! I'm neglecting bus shuttle just to prove the
              contradictions LTA have to you. </p>
              <p>And so how are you gonna expect car owners to give up cars? Yes
              you may say having trunks go to towns are better as they have
              direct connection instead of transferring feeders to town centres,
              but you see, if the trunks are so slow <strong>will they even take
              it in the first place?</strong> Does it even make a difference?</p>
              <p>Damn fail lah LTA. Everytime hear that disgusting rally of LHL
              really make me wanna puke. Want good for the people? Get your asses
              on the ground first lah. Car? So expensive. Train? So unreliable,
              and freq/train length so cui. Bus? Long-winded and crowded. Taxi?
              Choosy drivers, limited taxis, endless additional charges. Bike?
              Limiter bicycle lanes, cycle on pedestrian road will kena. So what
              expect us WALK 10+km to work ah? Wow what efficient workforce and
              economy there uh? LTA enough is enough hor, one day you really
              drive us to the corner alr ah, wait till we vote for opposition
              then you know!</p>
