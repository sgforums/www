              <p>New routes could get the axe if there is insufficient patronage.
              Transperth has practiced this before. Bus lobbyists who got their
              routes should start worrying now.</p>

              Yes, so many new routes were running on a "trial" basis, like 529. But in the end, it got covered by 518 &amp; 519.

              <p>I think CD is only be effective in areas (eg. Hillview) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">which currently do not have good MRT connection. In areas (eg. Jurong West) with good MRT connection, CD is redundant. </span></p>
              <p>For instance, as of now, I think only CDs at areas (eg. Hillview) with poor MRT connection are getting additional trips, whereas CDs at areas (eg. Jurong West) with good MRT connection still have two trips only.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Why? Because MRT is cheaper - sometimes faster - than CD. Since have cheaper alternative, people would rather take MRT instead of CD. </span></p>
              <p>Hence, this is what I think will happen:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>CDs (eg. 651) in areas with good MRT connection will be axed by the end of the first term (2013-2016).</li>
              <li>CDs (eg. 653) in areas with poor MRT connection will continue beyond 2016, until there's good MRT connection. </li>
              <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eventually, CDs will be gone</span></strong>, when every single residential corridor has good MRT connection.</li>

              <p>Why would they plan so many LRTs before even testing success of one? Same way why so many CD when most of them reach CBD onboard with 10-15 pax, some with 20-25 pax. So much money for these few people!?</p>

                      <p>To say that LRT is less cost-efficient and, worse still, less useful is an atrocious understatement. </p>
                      <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Firstly, reliability. On average the chances of an LRT breakdown to a bus is far less. Judging by the SBST system for example.

The advanced computer technology has made the system effectively kept the number of faults and human errors to a minimum. This is something a bus could simply not achieve. Also, the LRT had managed to keep its frequency with outstanding consistency. Even for the Bukit Panjang Line!

                      <p>Secondly, efficiency. Here I will be talking about this in the long run. LRTs are far more efficient than buses because it saves costs in the long run. Firstly, it saves manpower, as the cabs are fully automated. Secondly, it saves time, as these cars can run around without stopping every day, while for buses you need turnover time and change shifts. Due to its automated system it can also have flexible operating hours. The Sengkang LRT extends operating hours on PH while 372 does not. The LRT can carry more people in a single trip. A car of capacity of 105 passengers vs an SD of approx 80 pax (assuming it's SDs because it is highly inefficient to run DDs on feeders and compared to LRTs bendies are no match in cost-efficiency) shows that the LRT system can have a higher capacity than regular buses. Saves manpower, saves operating cost. Despite its higher costs of construction as long as it is built in the right neighbourhood it would be far more efficient than buses in the long run. </p>
                      <p>Thirdly, convenience. Here I shall be commenting in the perspective of a commuter. I mean, wouldn't you want a sheltered walkway to the station, happily top-up your card (instead of giving tedious coins) and travel on stable cars and reach town centre in a matter of around 10 minutes? Versus a bus which takes longer to come, uncomfortable to squeeze in, shaky, takes long time (traffic lights) and yet have to tap out and in again, which wastes one of the 5 trips you have on your ezlink card (assuming in the position of te majority of commuting crowds which take the train to the city), and thus indirectly wasting your money? For example, Rivervale LRT Station. 119 vs LRT. I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">challenge</span> you go count the pathetic amount of people boarding 119, despite it taking the most straightforward route available by road to STC. Seriously, the overall commuting environment is much better on the LRT (proper station with proper facilities) than the bus!</p>
                      <p>How could you say that LTA had not been doing trials properly? When Bukit Panjang LRT opened it became a hit (partially due to withdrawn services), only problem was its constant bugs. But LTA had seen that, and thus made major improvements for the Sengkang and Punggol LRTs, such as changing operator and using higher quality trains. They even made signalling upgrades to BPLRT itself! And what proof to say that LTA had decided not to invest anymore? Remember, LTA had even INVESTED ADDITIONAL CARS to IMPROVE the system. By 2016, 16 trains on the SBST system would be dual-car!</p>
                      <p>Please do try the LRT for commuting and daily travelling purposes before saying such a statement! As a former Tampines resident I can bravely tell you, life is so much better with the LRT, both for the operator and the commuter! </p>

              <p>No doubt, trains can run faster than buses. Without the traffic lights and traffic jams which buses experience, there is greater assurance that they can run on time. However, I do not think we need a LRT for this feature. Instead, we can simply install Bus Rapid Transit infrastructure - such as a sensor which allows buses to beat traffic light - to have such a feature on the buses.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not think a LRT car can carry 100 people inside. If one end of a BPLRT car can carry around 12 people, I think a LRT car (12*6 times the area of that one end) can carry around 72 people. Meanwhile, there are around 36 seats on a Single Deck bus. On the assumption that there can be around 20 people standing inside a bus, a Single deck bus can carry around 56 people. Therefore, it is true that a LRT car has higher capacity than a Single Deck bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if compare with DD, I think DD's capacity is higher than LRT's. Double Decker buses have around 20 more seats, so it can carry around 76 people. This is around 4 more than a LRT car. Yeah, I know it may not be a big difference. But in monetary terms, a DD is way more economical than a LRT car. Why? Because at least a DD creates more employment opportunities than a LRT car. Well, I am not sure about how much a DD or a LRT car costs (to purchase and maintain), but I think a DD is cheaper. Therefore, although a LRT may be more efficient than a Single Deck bus, it may instead be less efficient and less economical than a Double Decker bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whereas for convenience, I do not understand how LRT is more convenient than bus. Personally, I prefer bus more than LRT, because unlike LRT, I do not have to climb stairs or take lift before I can board a bus. Besides, I do not think it's totally correct to say that LRT is more able than buses in providing shelter during rain because at the very least, water from the LRT roof may drip down as I walk out of it - similar to when I exit from bus. Therefore, in terms of convenience, it may be better to commute on a bus than on a LRT.</p>

              Meanwhile, at Jurong West Street 64/75 areas, there seems to be under-supply of Double Decker buses. (Yes, DDs) During peak hours, it's almost impossible to board a bus (be it 243G or 181) at bus stops along Jurong West Street 64/75. Over at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, the queue can be so long that usually during evening peak hours, one has to miss one bus before being able to board a bus (either 243G or 181). It has been like this since a few years ago. I am not sure about 242 and 241, but I heard their situation is worse. 
              
              Even with Double Decker buses, the bus services plying areas along Jurong West Street 64/75 does not seem to be able to cope during evening peak hours. 
              
              I think LTA should create a 243P Peak Period Short Service which runs along Jurong West Street 64/75 and loops in front of Pioneer Primary School. What do you think?

              maintain), but I think a DD is cheaper. Therefore, although a LRT
              may be more efficient than a Single Deck bus, it may instead be
              less efficient and less economical than a Double Decker bus.</p>

              <p>Whereas for convenience, I do not understand how LRT is more

              because unlike LRT, I do not have to climb stairs or take lift
              before I can board a bus. Besides, I do not think it's totally
              correct to say that LRT is more able than buses in providing
              shelter during rain because at the very least, water from the LRT
              roof may drip down as I walk out of it - similar to when I exit
              from bus. Therefore, in terms of convenience, it may be better to
              commute on a bus than on a LRT.</p>

              <p>No doubt, trains can run faster than buses. Without the traffic
              lights and traffic jams which buses experience, there is greater
              assurance that they can run on time. However, I do not think we
              need a LRT for this feature. Instead, we can simply install Bus
              Rapid Transit infrastructure - such as a sensor which allows buses
              to beat traffic light - to have such a feature on the buses.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not think a LRT car can carry 100 people
              inside. If one end of a BPLRT car can carry around 12 people, I
              think a LRT car (12*6 times the area of that one end) can carry
              around 72 people. Meanwhile, there are around 36 seats on a Single
              Deck bus. On the assumption that there can be around 20 people
              standing inside a bus, a Single deck bus can carry around 56
              people. Therefore, it is true that a LRT car has higher capacity
              than a Single Deck bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, if compare with DD, I think DD's capacity is higher
              than LRT's. Double Decker buses have around 20 more seats, so it
              can carry around 76 people. This is around 4 more than a LRT car.
              Yeah, I know it may not be a big difference. But in monetary terms,
              a DD is way more economical than a LRT car. Why? Because at least a
              DD creates more employment opportunities than a LRT car. Well, I am
              not sure about how much a DD or a LRT car costs (to purchase and
              maintain), but I think a DD is cheaper. Therefore, although a LRT
              may be more efficient than a Single Deck bus, it may instead be
              less efficient and less economical than a Double Decker bus.</p>

              <p>The main difference is LRT is static, bus routes can be dynamic. Hence, based on new development models, you can easily adapt your bus route. Capacity wise, both are the same, so I do not see high an advantage/disadvantage.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>LRT is being modeled as subset of MRT. When timings for MRTs are extended at nights for eve of public holidays, take note that LRTs are also extended instead of bus services for those towns having LRTs. In most cases, LRTs bring one to within walking distance of a person's house. With LRT, one does not have to worry about last bus timing anymore when taking the last mrt home.

              <p>Hehe reality uh...</p>
              <p>You like reality? I give you reality! Now 80% of Rivervale residents have convenient access to the LRT. LRT is so popular it gets packed nearly throughout the day. As I;ve said before, if built in the right place, the LRT can equally serve majority of the neighbourhood, even if the route is static. If really cannot then introduce routes like 371 and 920 lor, but by having this system you save 2-3 bus routes alone! Less congestion! Better for commuters too. Capacity wise, LRT systems has a higher designed capacity of approx 8000 pax per day. 119 and 372 couldn't even reach half of that! This is also due to the frequency and consistency of services. </p>

              <p>In Tampines crowding in the interchange isnso severe it delays many of the buses! How is that a better feeder network?! And you cant compare Tampines either coz the town is old and there wasnt even a thought on building an LRT! Thats why now it cant have one!</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Adding on to your point, bus is a more flexible option than LRT. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Due to the hassle of having to climb stairs or take lift, LRT is actually more for </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">people to travel to MRT, less for people travelling intra-town, because one has to walk a bit from the LRT to the bus stop to take bus.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whereas for bus, one can simply take another bus from the same bus stop he alights. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bus offers a variety of route combinations for commuters to travel to different parts of town.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">LRT offers only that one route to the MRT station in town.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, bus is a more flexible option than LRT.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Besides, no one wants to take a short bus ride to LRT and take LRT to MRT, when they can simply take a bus ride to MRT. Hence, the coverage of LRT is actually quite limited.</span></li>

              <p>LRT is being modeled as subset of MRT. When timings for MRTs are
                      extended at nights for eve of public holidays, take note that LRTs
                      are also extended instead of bus services for those towns having
                      LRTs. With LRT, one does not have to worry about last bus
                      timing anymore when taking the last mrt home. Cheers to LRT.</p>

              <p><br> This is not true. Bus services serving residential areas operate for extended hours when MRT runs for extended hours.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I agree with your point that LRT is a subset/complement of MRT. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, this does not mean it should be feeder bus services. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I feel that being a subset/complement means that people take MRT from a minor LRT station instead of the main MRT station. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Although it will not make any difference to the crowding levels on the MRT platforms, it does relieve the traffic along the roads and pavements in the neighborhood.</span></li>
              <li>A good example is the<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>future Jurong Region Line, which I personally think it will be a 3-Car MRT, similar to Circle Line and Downtown Line that were also originally proposed to be LRT.</li>
              <li>Instead of taking bus to Chinese Garden MRT to take MRT to the city, people staying in Tengah can take bus to a JRL MRT station in Tengah and start their MRT journey there.</li>
              <li>This is especially helpful to Jurong Town Hall Road and Bukit Batok Road areas, which are already experiencing traffic congestion problems now. Needless to say, it will prevent further loading on the North South Line and Jurong East.</li>
