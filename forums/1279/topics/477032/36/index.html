              take the aircon bus hubs as example (several of which are major interchanges). the building structure is already fixed there and is integrated with the shopping mall. also the pillars distance apart, ceiling height are already all fixed and cant be changed much unless have to demolish and rebuild. so how to expand these interchanges? and also if the interchange becomes bigger hence more buses going in and out, it may also congest the interchange driveway access. so 1 probable way is to built some more bus hubs next to mrt stations and integrate with office or shopping malls.

              <p>Hmm like Boon Lay, prob expand the hub to the otherside? And from there, you move those shops over in order to get more spaces for the interchange. Is it possible? </p>

              <p>It is okay unless they build new ones. For instance, they are building one at Buangkok MRT. Then at Punggol Matilda. These two interchanges will take care of the issues at least around the NEL.</p>
              <p>Like wise there need to be new interchanges in the east to supplement Tampines, Pasir Ris and Bedok. In the west, Joo Koon might already ease the pressure off Boon Lay and Jurong East because it seems to be having quite a few slots.</p>

              <p>It is okay unless they build new ones. For instance, they are

              <p>Like wise there need to be new interchanges in the east to
              supplement Tampines, Pasir Ris and Bedok. In the west, Joo Koon

              <p>964 nope. There is high demand from Woodlands interchange and high demand at Admiralty MRT. 962 can, 964 better start from Woodlands. 963 can. </p>
              <p>965/969 cannot. People going friday prayers depends on 965, people schooling at AISS living in Woodlands depend on 965. People going to Chong Pang from Woodlands needs 969 and also those ITE students from Simei depends highly on this bus to get them back to Woodlands/Admiralty.</p>
              <p>966 can start from Sembawang, 960 also. 961 better dont, route is long enough. 966/960/963 can enhance connectivity to BPJ, Worst case 171 extend to Sembawang. </p>

              <p>Woodlands North Interchange should take care of Woodlands, and more space at Sembawang should take care of Yishun for now. In future, I believe Simpang will have a bus interchange, so some Yishun services might start from there.</p>
              <p>For now, quick fix 39 should be extended to Sembawang. 962/964/963 is a strict no according to me.</p>
              <p>I would not touch 857/860 also. Already too much crowd to disturb routing.</p>
              <p>852 is an interesting suggesting and worth considering as it will provide new links. </p>

              <p>Tampines North Interchange in future should provide relief to Tampines. UEC still has some spaces, so does Eunos.</p>
              <p>Bedok?? This one is already full... what is the alternative for Bedok interchange? Either services move to Tampines north or Eunos to create new routes at Bedok interchange or it will stay as it is. I don't think the new interchange is bigger than the current one.</p>
