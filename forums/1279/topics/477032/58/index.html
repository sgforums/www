              <p><br> yes i agree punggol side is no prob. rgd cris-crossing; whether the
              buses are going straight or turning right to punggol; they are all
              using the same leftmost shared lane. so when they try filter out
              from bus bay into this shared lane, they cut through the heavy
              traffic turning left to sengkang. will become chaos... the new
              busstop next to punggol is very long and i notice the bus bays are
              double lane. also the info boards are spaced at certain intervals.
              i suspect stop may have several bus-stop poles to divide into
              different berths-something like busy bus-stops in kowloon eg. so
              some sv may call at the front, some along the middle, others at the
              rear.</p>

              <p>Sorry for the tone. I was merely giving you the opinion that you so required. I suggest you see the travelling pattern of people now. Speed is key. If you make it express then may work la, but again CTE is already dangerously congested. Maybe after north south then may be able to work as many vehicles In the north would have used the north south instead. Or you could make it ply areas where there are no services to town and no MRT nearby. Otherwise if it isn't express and solely plied areas where bus services are dense, then I think this service will be just pure waste.</p>

              <p>Very OT<br><br>Yah very obvious, you see, <br><br>Once you work in a government organisation long enough, the replies and tones and the way you talk and type a reply is STANDARD SOP, it is ingrained in MOST civil servants. It will carry onto public forums. <br>Look at the forum in Singapolitics, discussions there by ordinary citizens are not discussed at all, the more rational citizen(most of the times) are being attacked/villified by pro-establishment supporters which the latter take an aggressive tone no matter how wrong certain policies are, it is simply, "I say so, you must follow and agree with me, no questions asked" mentality. <br>Singaporeans are much more educated, worldly now compared to the older generation and times have changed from needing a roof over head/job to more complicated interlinked matters. <br>Nothing wrong with that, but sometimes the tone is condescending like 
              parent talking to a child which shouldnt be as government of the day(any
               country) is elected by the citizens of the country, so the incumbents 
              shouldnt "lecture" the citizens, no one likes it.<br> If one has emailed to government organisations in little red dot often, you will get what i mean.<br>At times, i do wonder if there is any free speech in the country. ( i bet someone will write and tell me free speech must be backed up by proof[typical government mentality]). Soon every country will become "minority report" state.<br><br><br>Feel free to read but do not reply as this thread is on BSEP. PERIOD</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, if after so long, you still think I am from LTA after so many explanations, then I think I can prove to you. At a time convenient to you, I am willing to meet up with you at Punggol MRT and show you my letter of appointment from a private company. After this, you better change your way of thinking.
