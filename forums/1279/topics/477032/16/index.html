The three services are:<br><br>          a.  </span></span> <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><span>17 February 2014   : West Coast City Direct Service 655;<br>          b.  </span></span> <span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">17 February 2014   : Sembawang City Direct Service 656; and<br>          c.  </span> <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">24 February 2014   : Jurong East City Direct Service 657.</span><br><br></span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><span>2.     These bus services will start with two one-way trips to the CBD on weekday mornings and two one-way return trips in the evenings, excluding public holidays. More trips may be added depending on the demand for the services. With fewer stops and the use of expressways, journey times will be comparable to that of taking a bus and transferring to the MRT into the city.<br><br>3.     From 17 February, commuters travelling from West Coast to the CBD on weekday mornings will be served by City Direct Service 655. Operated by Woodlands Transport Service Pte Ltd, the bus service will ply Teban Gardens Road, Pandan Gardens and West Coast Road before taking the West Coast Highway to get to the CBD. On weekday evenings, the service will connect commuters from Central Boulevard and Shenton Way back to the West Coast neighbourhood.<br><br>4.     Similarly, on 17 February 2014, City Direct Service 656 operated by Loh Gim Chong Transport will begin operations from Sembawang; it will ply Canberra Road, Admiralty Link, Sembawang Drive and Sembawang Avenue before heading towards Orchard Road, Bras Basah Road and Shenton Way via the Seletar Expressway (SLE) and Central Expressway (CTE). In the evening, it will bring commuters back to Sembawang.<br><br>5.     Transtar Travel Pte Ltd will operate City Direct Service 657 from Jurong East beginning 24 February 2014. The service will ply Jurong West Ave 1, Jurong East Ave 1 and Toh Guan Road, before heading towards Robinson Road and Marina Boulevard via the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). Similarly, it will bring commuters back to the Jurong East and Jurong West housing estates in the evening.<br><br>6.     The three City Direct bus services to be launched are part of six awarded by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in November 2013 under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP)<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/#*"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">*</span></a></sup>, to tap on the resources of PBOs to augment those of the public transport operators (PTOs). Commuters can expect another three City Direct bus services from Hougang, Bedok, and Eunos to the CBD in third quarter of 2014.</span><br><br></span></p>

              So do these three operators allow EZ-Link payment? All the same, WTS should be allowed a 3rd PTO license.

              <p>BSRF pick SMRT buses except for 858(reliability issues) for the

              really duplicating existing bus routes, eg 120...<br> <br> sv190 already has a high freq but still packed. Why?! gahmen buy
              rigid 2 axle... Who in the right frame of mind will do that when
              population target is 6.9m? Shows and expose that gahmen departments
              are not collaborating and each is doing their own thing...<br> <br> CGA buses should use 3 axle rigid if bendy(length)/DD(height) is

              adequate buses(capacity wise in the likes of bendy/DDs) on the
              roads, if not, who with a car or intend to buy a car will migrate
              to public transport to work as an option?!<br> <br> If the gahmen is sincere in getting Singaporeans to use public
              transport(particularly buses), they should implement FULL BUS lanes
              throughout SG, not half baked ideas as partial bus lanes(red/yellow

              <p>All the bros commenting on citaros, do take note...<br><br>In EUROPE, 
              some versions of citaros have 3 doors, 1 for entry, 2 for exit(1 in the 
              middle of the bus, 1 at the end), same goes for the same as MAN bus... I
               have taken MAN 3 axle in EUR(Salzburg, Austria to be exact) before, it 
              has 3 doors...<br><br>For some cases with 3 doors, the bus is still full
               low floor to the rear just that there is no rear window due to rear 
              mounted engine and only lesser seats behind, Italian buses in Rome, 
              Florence have this configuration...<br><br>For Salzburg's 3 door 3 axle 
              MAN(rt.25), the doors are on the opposite due to driving on the left. 
              the bus still has rear picture window, just that the seats opposite the 
              rear door are raised high to accomodate the engine<br><br>It is a matter
               whether the buyer wan to reconfigure the bus, i believe the 
              manufacturer would accede to this when the order is substantial 
              enough...<br><br>So the next question is did LTA do due diligence when allowing SBST/SMRT to buy new buses? <br>The
               commuting public has constantly wrote to the press to have exit doors 
              at the rear for easy alighting and allowing people to move in, it shows 
              time again and again that the authorities are too stuck in their ivory 
              towers to listen to fellow Singaporeans that are using public transport.</p>
