              <p>Yes 119 is heavily duplicated but it has its own uniqueness in Punggol field opp blk 272C and 268D and rivervale drive blk 117A and sengkang east ave. It is the only service that connects these less frequented roads and connects them to kovan. Thus it still has its loading at times occasionally and is still valued for Punggol west and sengkang east residents. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS5011L, I am right too. Everybody can see very clearly that 119 DDs are too excessive. They may come useful only at later stages of year 2015 onwards. </p>
              <p>In my earlier paragraphs, I am talking about why sbs 119 is there and not removed even though its route is quite heavily duplicated save for some unique sectors. Cheers.</p>

              sv 82,107,119,136: i believe can merge some of these together to create better efficiency. how abt extend 119 to loop at Nex? 82 merge with 107 as per previous comments by others. and i find sv 136 getting more and more crowded esp bet Kovan to Sengkang stretch.

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, sv 82, 119, 136 serve different crowds in Punggol and provide direct links separately for different segments of crowds. So cannot merge and end up 1 service no gone. Sv 136 is very popular in sengkang and hougang because of the various schools it passes by enroute to kovan. Its peak frequency is almost double that of non-peak frequency. Moreover, the sengkang east side near rivervale drive and sengkang east way has few trunk bus services. Thus when you feel crowded, it is usual. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, I did not read wrongly. What I write is merely a suggestion and explain the scenarios for sbs 82, 119, 136. I think mr SBS3688Y misinterpreted the sentences. See my response to mr SBS3688Y.  I am always in favour if merging sbs 82 and sbs 107 in my much earlier posts. Just hope LTA will give in to all of us here one fine day. Cheers.</p>

              rgd 119 &amp; 136: i feel 136 loading along upp sgoon rd is esp high thats why i suggest extend 119 to loop at Nex to help in the loading and provide another alternative. also if 82 &amp; 107 merge, 119 looping at Nex can bridge the gap due to merger of 82.
