              <p>Woodlands North Interchange should take care of Woodlands, and

              <p><br>171 to Sembawang is a better option. I have proposed it plies CCK to Sembawang, bringing new connections between CCK, BPJ, Yishun and Sembawang. To Sembawang, it should go via Yishun Ave 5 and then Yishun Ave 2, so that it does not disturb the current people there.</p>

              <p>Punggol Interchange is temporary as well - depends what the new plan looks like. For the current # of services, Punggol is okay - can in fact take in 2 more services. But once Punggol West and North develop, there is definitely need for another interchange, which will be at Punggol Matilda.</p>
              <p>For which services should got to Woodlands North from WRI, it completely depends on the exact location of Woodlands North interchange.</p>

              <p>39 should be extended according to me and ply uni-directional DDs from SBST side. This will provide uniqye connections. I agree with the other suggestion here that 39 should loop at Loyang and come back because its route from Loyang to Tampines is redundant.</p>

If extended to Sembawang, then SMRT has to take care of appropriate fleet deployment and frequency improvement.</p>

              <p><br>Possible, but 860 extending to Sembawang is a bit unlikely because it is meant to provide connectivity between Yishun MRT and Ring road and Khatib MRT. Khatib MRT comes on Yishun Ave 2, so further extension from there is always a possibility.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I dont agree 39 should be shortened. 39 has high demand in the Tampines &gt; Loyang sector during peak hours. Lots of students depend on the service. It provides an direct connection towards Pasir Ris along Tamp ave 2, and helps relieve sv 81 load.<br><br>Demand for 39 towards Tampines is probably low after Blk 302 stop, because there's 292 in parallel, and people living around the MRT track usually walk under the tracks  instead of taking a bus.<br><br>I do advocate extending to SBW if it means DDs can be deployed on it. Likewise with sv 969, its main problem is capacity during peak hours. Adding more buses will just create more bunching and chaos at interchanges. <br></p></div>
