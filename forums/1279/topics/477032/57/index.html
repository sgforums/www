              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, you may be right or wrong. The length of the super long stops will help too. Loading of bus patterns may or may not change drastically in the longer term. Run time of 5 to 8 mins may be a bit on the high side as predicted but it may be slightly offset by the passenger loading pattern. I see an overall improved situation few months after implementation. </p>

                  some of us have been talking of for eg 27A to use DDs for sometime already and till now the PTO/LTA still dun seem to bother like that.
                  the coming new bus orders should increase the proportions of DD orders. or else have to live with regrets for another 2 decades. hope history wont repeat itself again.

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, yes I know it is weird. For TPE stop next to sengkang, there is still space to move from stop to the lane to turn right to Punggol or move straight northwards to continue on TPE. Just that the thick island separating gives some reasons for us to hope that it may only be for services turning into sengkang (Punggol road) only. Cannot wait to know the actual answers! Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Azharjj, no for sbs 161 because this bus service does not ply along the new bus stops at TPE. Its current route is out of the range which means it does not bypass the stops at all. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, yes I know it is weird. For TPE stop next to
              sengkang, there is still space to move from stop to the lane to
              turn right to Punggol or move straight northwards to continue on
              TPE. Just that the thick island separating gives some reasons for
              us to hope that it may only be for services turning into sengkang
              (Punggol road) only. Cannot wait to know the actual answers!
              Cheers. </p>

              looking from actual situation, i think there will be lots of cris-crossings and cause bottlenecks if buses try filter to go straight or turn right. worse every few moments traffuc lights turn red buses got stuck in between lanes and cause further congestion. we shall see...

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Anyway, nothing much to worry. Sbs 27 stopping there will just so called 'shift the goalpost only'.

So in actual fact, there is no significant passenger loading addition for sbs 27. Currently people who transfer to Punggol road stop to take sbs 27 there will split into transferring at TPE stop too.

              yes i agree punggol side is no prob.
              rgd cris-crossing; whether the buses are going straight or turning right to punggol; they are all using the same leftmost shared lane. 
              so when they try filter out from bus bay into this shared lane, they cut through the heavy traffic turning left to sengkang. will become chaos...
              
              the new busstop next to punggol is very long and i notice the bus bays are double lane. also the info boards are spaced at certain intervals. i suspect stop may have several bus-stop poles to divide into different berths-something like busy bus-stops in kowloon eg. so some sv may call at the front, some along the middle, others at the rear.
