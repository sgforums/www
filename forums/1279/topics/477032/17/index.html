              <p>Hi mr busAnalyser, your idea of filling up the bus is good but
              then this defeats the idea of the initial decision of connecting
              orchard road and CGA by sbs 36. At the time of introduction, this
              was meant as a fast connection. Then the idea was slightly tweaked
              to include marine parade residents to CGA to beef up the passenger
              load of sbs 36 to make it sort of semi-express. With your new idea,
              you abandon both objectives which i believe should not be so. For
              svs 36 and 48, let it be status quo. If the peak at tanah merah
              towards bedok south and marine parade is very high, this shows the
              possibility of introducing new service. We cannot always harbour
              the idea of changing other services drastically to alleviate a new
              peak situation. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I suggested an express service from Orchard as well... May be you chose to ignore that... I don't think every time introducing new services is the solution... Why do you propose new service for Tanah Merah-Bedok south and not for orchard-cga express? If you take 36 you will notice, no one takes it from Orchard to cga... It is such a waste of time.. Need a service from orchard to cga via ECP... This way even people with bags / living in hotels can take bus to airport.</p>

              <p>190 is a perennial issue... Like I had said, introducing 972 will not ease the load on 190... And it is exactly the same... If loading is distributed, now it is on 700.</p>

                          when the KUBs were first introduced in 2007; many pax were not used to the step along the middle aisle. and many complained of tripping over etc. When the 1st fully low floor Citaro was introduced, SMRT did online survey and they claimed pax were very happy as there was totally no step along the aisle but fail to say if pax were happy with the extra step to the seats. And they didnt take another survey now to check if pax still prefer fully low floor or low-entry bus, as pax are now already used to KUB buses already. Of all low-entry buses, i think KUB aisle height are still the best. Sentosa B7RLE higher aisle is extremely high and not user friendly. MB OC500LE higher aisle is steeper and higher than KUBs and so not as good.

              <p>All the bros commenting on citaros, do take note...<br> <br> In EUROPE, some versions of citaros have 3 doors, 1 for entry, 2
              for exit(1 in the middle of the bus, 1 at the end), same goes for
              the same as MAN bus... I have taken MAN 3 axle in EUR(Salzburg,
              Austria to be exact) before, it has 3 doors...<br> <br> For some cases with 3 doors, the bus is still full low floor to the
              rear just that there is no rear window due to rear mounted engine
              and only lesser seats behind, Italian buses in Rome, Florence have
              this configuration...<br> <br> For Salzburg's 3 door 3 axle MAN(rt.25), the doors are on the
              opposite due to driving on the left. the bus still has rear picture
              window, just that the seats opposite the rear door are raised high
              to accomodate the engine<br> <br> It is a matter whether the buyer wan to reconfigure the bus, i
              believe the manufacturer would accede to this when the order is
              substantial enough...<br> <br> So the next question is did LTA do due diligence when allowing
              SBST/SMRT to buy new buses?<br> The commuting public has constantly wrote to the press to have exit
              doors at the rear for easy alighting and allowing people to move
              in, it shows time again and again that the authorities are too
              stuck in their ivory towers to listen to fellow Singaporeans that
              are using public transport.</p>

              bro; i dont think these buses are suitable for sg roads. sg roads are relatively narrow; too busy and the bus captains will find it hard to change lanes; esp looking at the typical sg motorists behaviour. i rather its replaced with bendy buses which are more flexible to manuvoure. remember what problems SBS997A faced along the roads. A ST article reported that 997A was overtaken by 3 regular SDs along the route while on sv 76.

              <p>Ah you are mistaken, it is more maneuverable because of the last axle wic is the same as the front axle, reduce turning radius, the albus rt 25 wic i took in salzburg travels on a 2 lane road, one up and one down... <br><br>As it leaves Salzburg train station before it head to the mountains, the roads got more narrower but bus sure can do a tight turn...<br><br>SBS997A was an experiment wic was way too long for 3 axle bus...<br><br></p>

              <p>I had proposed that sv 120 be modified to start at Kent Ridge terminal and via Tehlok Blangah go to Bukit Merah Central (one way), do Redhill Close (both ways), Redhill MRT, Margaret Drive, Commonwealth MRT, Tanglin Halt Rd, Commonwealth Dr, Queensway and back... This way you would really provide new connections such as new bus stops along Redhill Close... connect Tehlok Blangah to Redhill MRT... provide alternate option for Margaret Drive residents, provide MRT link to Commonwealth dr residents, where sv 61 plies and these people have to walk a long distance from Commonwealth MRT... These are the kind of routes needed under BSEP connecting and building new bus stops on roads that do not have any service rather than just creating routes for the sake of it.</p>

              <p><br>That is what I am scared of in future also.. if u see most Woodlands, CCK and Yishun feeders need WAB buses more than 182/183/192... The number of PIW in these areas is a lot more than those in student related bus services or industrial services...</p>
              <p>But SMRT does not have high capacity WAB buses... so if it has to make any service WAB it is at the cost of high capacity buses... So for now, I hope SMRT does not make more services WAB like it did to 811... then introduce 811A to cope with loading... but still cannot do properly...</p>
              <p>Once WAB DD come, I think SMRT will have to make some feeder / intra town services DD/WAB combination to make these services WAB... else need to order WAB bendies.. but according to my friend... that is not in the plan yet... right now they are still trying to confirm the DD details.... and so much time to do that...</p>

              <p><br>The buses in Luzern are like trams... I have seen them... they are long and they are connected to wires on the top... Very bad system because in case of road work etc, the bus cannot go a different path.... just like tram network.</p>

              <p><br> That is what I am scared of in future also.. if u see most
              Woodlands, CCK and Yishun feeders need WAB buses more than
              182/183/192... The number of PIW in these areas is a lot more than
              those in student related bus services or industrial services...</p>
              <p>But SMRT does not have high capacity WAB buses... so if it has
              to make any service WAB it is at the cost of high capacity buses...
              So for now, I hope SMRT does not make more services WAB like it did
              to 811... then introduce 811A to cope with loading... but still
              cannot do properly...</p>
              <p>Once WAB DD come, I think SMRT will have to make some feeder /
              intra town services DD/WAB combination to make these services
              WAB... else need to order WAB bendies.. but according to my
              friend... that is not in the plan yet... right now they are still
              trying to confirm the DD details.... and so much time to do
              that...</p>

              <p>right now, only Rigids have up to 2 spaces for the PIWs. the OCs have that currently.</p>
              <p>the feeders are mainly high loading but it is different from that of the trunks.</p>
              <p>putting bendies, all are not WAB; the sole WAB Bendy 388S has space for one PIW. to go WAB, 60-70% must be WAB. putting the OCs, Taros or A22s will lead to the infamous 811 problem. is DD a solution?</p>
              <p>a inital DDs would be number around 50, much would have gone on to 190. not until more high capacity WAB buses come around.</p>
              <p>hmm wondering what is LTA thinking this round ...</p>

              <p>Ah you are mistaken, it is more maneuverable because of the last
              axle wic is the same as the front axle, reduce turning radius, the
              albus rt 25 wic i took in salzburg travels on a 2 lane road, one up
              and one down...<br> <br> As it leaves Salzburg train station before it head to the
              mountains, the roads got more narrower but bus sure can do a tight
              turn...<br> <br> SBS997A was an experiment wic was way too long for 3 axle
              bus...<br></p>

              <p>the maximum for a rigid buses is 12m as per SMRT tender for its buses, 18m for bendies.</p>
              <p>SBS had a 14.5m super-long vehicle SBS997A and 2 18.75m Bendies SBS998Y and SBS999U.</p>
              <p>ball passed back to SBST.</p>
              <p>seems like now SBST, SMRT, Comfort DelGro and Bus-Plus are playing this with LTA. pass here, pass there, done nothing.</p>
