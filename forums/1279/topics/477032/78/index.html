              <p>I know! Thats why I put 119 first. Explain that. </p>
              <p>And I use 372 becoz of its low freq as compared to LRT.</p>
              <p>White elephant?! Are you mad?! Oh yeah man, a white elephant could get its trains severely crowded, day and night! So crowded LTA even added trains! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How is it even a white elephant, may I ask?!</span> bias?! And at least you can pack 105 pax, vs a small 70-80 plus pax on an SD, or a DD which would take forever to reach optimum capacity!</p>
              <p>In Tampines crowding in the interchange isnso severe it delays many of the buses! How is that a better feeder network?! And you cant compare Tampines either coz the town is old and there wasnt even a thought on building an LRT! Thats why now it cant have one!</p>

              <p>As I said before, you cannot compare buses to LRT. My point is in the absence of LRT network, there would have been a robust feeder network that would have given doorstep service to most HDBs. You still had to introduce 371 inspite of LRT as LRT cannot cater to every road except for the major roads.</p>
              <p>Why people don't use 119? It is because of frequency that can be 15-17 mins. If LRT was not there, there would have been a 379 or something to cater to this area with frequency of 3-4 mins. Also, 119 does get loading from Compass Point to Rivervale inspite of LRT. In fact, when 119 used to start at Sengkang Interchange, you could see the bus get 50-55 pax easily at the interchange. Now that has changed because people have to cross Sengkang east ave and take the bus from opposite side.</p>
              <p>Also, you have to note, many people along Sengkang East Way where LRT does not ply rely heavily on 50,119 to get to MRT.</p>

              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Adding on to your point, bus is a more flexible option than LRT. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Due to the hassle of having to climb stairs or take lift, LRT is actually more for </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">people to travel to MRT, less for people travelling intra-town, because one has to walk a bit from the LRT to the bus stop to take bus.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whereas for bus, one can simply take another bus from the same bus stop he alights. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bus offers a variety of route combinations for commuters to travel to different parts of town.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">LRT offers only that one route to the MRT station in town.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Hence, bus is a more flexible option than LRT.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Besides, no one wants to take a short bus ride to LRT and take LRT to MRT, when they can simply take a bus ride to MRT. Hence, the coverage of LRT is actually quite limited.</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>This is not true. Bus services serving residential areas operate for extended hours when MRT runs for extended hours.</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I agree with your point that LRT is a subset/complement of MRT. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, this does not mean it should be feeder bus services. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I feel that being a subset/complement means that people take MRT from a minor LRT station instead of the main MRT station. </span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Although it will not make any difference to the crowding levels on the MRT platforms, it does relieve the traffic along the roads and pavements in the neighborhood.</span></li>
              <li>A good example is the future Jurong Region Line, which I personally think it will be a 3-Car MRT, similar to Circle Line and Downtown Line that were also originally proposed to be LRT.</li>
              <li>Instead of taking bus to Chinese Garden MRT to take MRT to the city, people staying in Tengah can take bus to a JRL MRT station in Tengah and start their MRT journey there.</li>
              <li>This is especially helpful to Jurong Town Hall Road and Bukit Batok Road areas, which are already experiencing traffic congestion problems now. Needless to say, it will prevent further loading on the North South Line and Jurong East.</li>

              <p>Hi mr Jurongwestresident, I am afraid you reply without reading the gist of my initial view. I think what you are saying is not true. My version is correct. When timings for MRTs are extended at nights for eve of public holidays, take note LRTs are also extended instead of bus services FOR THOSE TOWNS HAVING LRTs. Did you read these words 'FOR THOSE TOWNS HAVING LRTs'? They prefer LRT to buses for these towns and did not extend the bus timings. If you have read this, your lengthy replies will not be able to substantiate your points. Your points are for those towns where there is no LRT and of course feeder bus services have to be extended to complement MRT last timings. This one everybody knows. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3004X, yes I agree with you. Bunching or whatsoever
              reason is very normal. Buses leave early or leave late is perfectly
              normal. This cannot be controlled 100%. As long as there is human
              factor in any issue, this will always occur and cannot be
              eradicated. There is no need to blame the bus operator or planner

              <p>As I said before, you cannot compare buses to LRT. My point is
                  in the absence of LRT network, there would have been a robust
                  feeder network that would have given doorstep service to most HDBs.
                  You still had to introduce 371 inspite of LRT as LRT cannot cater
                  to every road except for the major roads.</p>
              <p>Why people don't use 119? It is because of frequency that can be
                  15-17 mins. If LRT was not there, there would have been a 379 or
                  something to cater to this area with frequency of 3-4 mins. Also,
                  119 does get loading from Compass Point to Rivervale inspite of
                  LRT. In fact, when 119 used to start at Sengkang Interchange, you
                  could see the bus get 50-55 pax easily at the interchange. Now that
                  has changed because people have to cross Sengkang east ave and take
                  the bus from opposite side.</p>
              <p>Also, you have to note, many people along Sengkang East Way
                  where LRT does not ply rely heavily on 50,119 to get to MRT.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Of course LRT cannot cater to everyone... This aint fairy land...</p>
              <p>But at least it gives majority a better option to commute and a faster choice...</p>
              <p>And dont fool with me here man, for before the LRT kicked in there was only a 371 which ran at 15 min freq... And those alighting at Rivervale on 119 is really not much! </p>
              <p> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">And please don't joke with me... Tampines feeders and townlinks still come at a freq of 6 mins (twice the freq of LRT) and STILL subject to delays which happens every damn time! Is THAT what you call a robust network? I doubt so. </span></p>
              <p>Not to say buses are not needed of course (new 371), in fact I did not even say that. But to say that the LRT is a WHITE ELEPHANT is an appaling thing to say! Please consider again!</p>

It's not that surprising if they're just normal new CItaros &amp; Wrights, but these new ones are regged under the BSEP scheme eh. And it's not like those existing BSEP Wrights &amp; Citaros with no perm svcs yet (3375A, 6359C, 6388T, 6413D etc) have disappeared from the SP fleet.. </p>

              <p><br>I doubt it is going to be a new service because the only two indicated are for Hougang and Punggol.</p>
              <p>It could be fleet add but again BNDEP keeps BSEP buses SP long time before deploying them. Now they have more Citaros spare after 3354/3355 went after months of being SP to sv 20. 3400 is also BNDEP.</p>

Public transport is to take into account all players and not leave anybody in the lurch. Take note LRT stations are normally 1 bus stop apart. For those in close proximity to 2 LRTs, cheers. For those with 1 LRT at doorstep, cheers. For those who are not having LRTs at doorsteps, they will definitely be in walking distance (400 metres) to LRT. Sbs transit will definitely extend the timing of last bus if they find residents not to fulfill any criteria above. But fortunately, they have not needed to resort to this step yet. Cheers. </p>

              <p>That was exactly what I was thinking!</p>
              <p>Trains should turn back at Nibong... They couldve easily added that small stretch if there are currently no turnback facilities. And the middle platform at PTC should've been used too! Making the West stretch a good shuttle service!</p>
