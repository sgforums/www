              <p><br> You might be right that Buangkok is closer to Hougang Ave 4, but
              also the truth is a lot of people take 109 from Serangoon after
              alighting from CCL and NEL to Hougang Ave 4/9. I have taken a WEG
              6+pm from Serangoon Interchange and while it left interchange with
              50-55 pax, along Boundary Rd and YCK Link, it picked up pax that
              made more than 90 pax. And I was surprised to see 60-70 pax
              alighted on stops along HG Ave 9 and HG Ave 4. When the bus came to
              Buangkok Green, it was left with barely 30-35 pax, some of whom who
              boarded along HG Ave 9/4.</p>
              <p>So for me this SWT makes sense, else SBST would have to
              introduce more DDs during that time from Serangoon to Changi (which
              could be waste of resources since beyond Buangkok loading is very
              low in PM).</p>

              <p>BA, dd77, the typical SGrean tinking doesn make much sense... rationally speaking ine would head to a train station closest to their home rather than get caught in sgn ctrl jam n arrival timing of 109A.</p>
              <p>It's obvious i noe the direction fr SGN to HG is the load, m givin an example... morning fr 4/9 to buangkok, if evening time shld b fr Buangkok to ave4/9</p>

              <p>Yes, I ever did mention this kind of loading before for 120... Many workers can take 120 from Alexandra Road (Alexandra Retail Centre area) direct to Redhill MRT Station. But mostly, this loading is found during peak hours, so I'm not surprised at 'late 5pm to early 6pm', which is deemed as the peak hour.</p>

              <p>it is not so easy for LTA/SBST/SMRT to go introduce new bus services.. imagine everyday, so many ppl write in to suggest this new service and that new service..... so is LTA going to implement everyone of them??? </p>

              <p>That is why I said there are more lobbyists than hobbyists. There is this assumption that building the grassroots and getting the numbers automatically translate to having things their way when it comes to getting what new buses and new routes.</p>
              <p>In some cases the lobbyists did get their wish, especially if they have been very vocal. And then the public wonder why their fares are going up so much more and why certain routes tend to run empty...</p>

              <p>You can't say that...</p>
              <p>Svcs like 12, 27, 240, 372 do have load during off-peak. </p>
              <p>List goes on. </p>
              <p>120? Nah. </p>
              <p>What you have to understand is that some svcs have such a low ridership during off-peak it does not justify the amount of buses deployed or even warrant the operating times. For example, every weekends and every night after 8 svc 5 gets full SD fleet due to lower ridership. </p>
              <p>Go look at HK. They do reduce svcs to run only on weekday peak to cut down costs and save taxpayers money. When loading gets too low and the svc has little exclusive area to run (ie heavy duplication along most of its route). You have to understand, resources are not infinite. In fact new svcs in HK are introduced through regrouping and reshuffling its current bus svcs. As such some svcs get reduced or even withdrawn to introduce a new svc, or add freq to another high-demand svc. </p>
              <p>I give you one example. Svc 798, TKL/TKO &lt;-&gt; Shatin. Express svc. During Peak hour gets so crowded with so many people going to Shatin in the morning (and vice versa) even an average freq of 7 mins with 12m DDs could barely cope with the load. Fleet came from withdrawn 796B, which very rarely gets crowded, and downgraded 797M, which is practically empty during off-peak. </p>
              <p>You see how resources are used here? Same should be applied to 120. In fact had it not been the quite-acceptable load during peak I would have thought it to be withdrawn. Now that there are some load after all (seen quite a number alighting from 120 during AM peak), maybe it should be dealt with another way. Either way it will be able to benefit more people out there. </p>
