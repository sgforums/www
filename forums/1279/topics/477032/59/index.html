                                  and tones and the way you talk and type a reply is STANDARD SOP, it
                                  is ingrained in MOST civil servants. It will carry onto public
                                  forums.<br> Look at the forum in Singapolitics, discussions there by ordinary
                                  citizens are not discussed at all, the more rational citizen(most
                                  of the times) are being attacked/villified by pro-establishment
                                  supporters which the latter take an aggressive tone no matter how
                                  wrong certain policies are, it is simply, "I say so, you must
                                  follow and agree with me, no questions asked" mentality.<br> Singaporeans are much more educated, worldly now compared to the
                                  older generation and times have changed from needing a roof over
                                  head/job to more complicated interlinked matters.<br> Nothing wrong with that, but sometimes the tone is condescending
                                  like parent talking to a child which shouldnt be as government of
                                  the day(any country) is elected by the citizens of the country, so
                                  the incumbents shouldnt "lecture" the citizens, no one likes
                                  it.<br> If one has emailed to government organisations in little red dot
                                  often, you will get what i mean.<br> At times, i do wonder if there is any free speech in the country. (
                                  i bet someone will write and tell me free speech must be backed up
                                  by proof[typical government mentality]). Soon every country will
                                  become "minority report" state.<br> <br> <br> Feel free to read but do not reply as this thread is on BSEP.

              <p>Bringing the discussion back to the topic proper, with regards to Sv 358P &amp; 359P and why the poster seems to depict different-sized buses for the 2 svcs, I've a few insights after living in Pasir Ris all these years:</p>
              <p>For <strong>Sv 358's east loop (&amp; consequently 358P</strong>), the demand for this svc actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depends very heavily</span> on the departing timings of Sv 12, 21 &amp; even 17 from PSR Int. (ie. there is quite abit of duplication) <br><br>Because for alot of pax from PSR Int to get to PSR Dr 6, they tend to wait outside the berths for either of Sv 12, 21 or 358 to come. If Sv 12 / 21 comes first, the Dr 6 crowd would board those svcs &amp; leave the Sv 358 bus relatively empty. On the other hand, if Sv 12 or 21 had departed not long ago and just nice two packed trains stop at PSR MRT, you'll see Sv 358's east loop flooded with pax. </p>
              <p>If you're talking about Dr 4, then the same thing applies: the load for Dr 4 on Sv 358's east loop depends alot on Sv 17's timings as well. If a DD on Sv 17 comes at the same time as Sv 358's east loop, almost certainly all the pax would flood to the DD instead. </p>
              <p>So i'm not too surprised that for Sv 358P they might be using mini-buses instead. Because the only sector along that route which wouldn't be heavily-duplicated at all by other svcs is that St 41 stretch (the hill-top &amp; Casuarina Pri sector). </p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>As for <strong>Sv 359's east loop (&amp; Sv 359P), </strong>for the pax to get to St 51 (Coral Sec that sector), it's either a) you walk home from PSR MRT to St 51, or b) you take Sv 359. Or for some ppl, c) walk out to the bus stop at Dr 1 &amp; board 1 stop to PSR Town Park &amp; walk home. Most ppl aren't that athletic yeah, and they board Sv 359 instead.</p>
              <p>As for St 11 that sector (which is where I live), the bulk of the east loop's pax for Sv 359 actually alights here. There isn't much alternative to get to here, unless you board Sv 12, 17 or 21 and stop at one of the stops along Dr 1 &amp; walk a distance home. Or take Sv 359. <br><br>So the demand for Sv 359P is definitely much higher than that of Sv 358P. So i'm not too surprised that Sv 358P might / very likely will use mini-buses instead of the full-sized coaches for Sv 359P. Hope this solves alot of the hoohaa raised by some bus fans in the earlier pages on why Sv 358P might be going to use mini-buses instead..Although I sure wouldn't complain if they're using full-sized coaches for Sv 358 too! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
