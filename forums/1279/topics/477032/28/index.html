              <p>It depends when did you see this. Before BSEP, sv 79 had a fleet
              of 9 buses with majority SDs. Now, it is a fleet of 12 buses with
              10 DDs and only 2 SDs. Moreover, 143 is also almost full fleet DD.
              Hence, it would be rear that people at Teban will not be able to
              board a bus anymore. I agree when 79 had majority SDs, and a 143
              has not called, a lot of pax would be left behind. But this is
              history now. AM peak, 79 almost comes empty from Penjuru and gets a
              good 60-70 pax at Teban Gardens stops.</p>
              <p>Hence, I don't think there is a need for either 78 or a new
              service for Teban Gardens.</p>

              <p>actually, if u look at the demand pattern, most buses are only
              FULL for one trip in AM peak and one trip in pm peak.... take sv70
              for example... 7am departure from YCK, will be full for the trip
              towards to Shenton way, the return trip from Shenton way at 830am
              will be quite empty and likewise forthe evening peak, you can see
              so many empty Sv70 buses along YCK road to Shenton way... same go
              forSv45 as well...and lots of other services... the no of buses are
              actually enough, but then the demand are not evenly spread

              operation, you should know two way communication is vital and
              sometimes we should also self-introduce ourselves a bit more. So is
              it not convenient for you to say where you live at? It does not
              need to be precise. Just an approximation. For example, sengkang,

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, please wake up your idea la. How to go stalk people when an approximation of the area is given? I only asked for an estimation. It is okay to give and it is okay to decline. Nothinh wrong with it. What is purpose of stalking??? We have more important priorities in life than this idiotic idea of yours. We are in this forum to exchange ideas bout buses. Not to kerp harping on LTA mole or whatever you try to link to. I am not interested in LTA and i am free to choose whatever topics i like to say.
