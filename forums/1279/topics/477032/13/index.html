              <p><br>No surpise right. This is the same case for most CGA services that often get held up even at CGA while going from one terminal to another. This is the same reason why we also see sv 27 bunch so much. Same with 858; it is also worse because of the long route right from Woodlands looping at CGA.</p>

              <p>Honestly, if the operators have an opportunity to dump DDs onto those CGA svcs, they would have jumped at the chance to do that. Unfortunately because of how they had built the Terminals &amp; their subsequent basement PTBs, they can only use SDs.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, a DD slot for every 2 SDs is a very easily achievable target. haha. Then your bunching probs won't occur that much already because 1 DD can carry 2 SDs' worth of pax.</p>

              <p>858 needs some downroutes and/or shortworking trips to separate the loading. maybe something similar to 502A/518A, between woodlands and CGA, while skipping sembawang and yishun, which can separately be served by downroutes/swt to CGA.</p>

              <p>I mean,</p>
              <p>If CGA ever wants to achieve DD-accommodation for the bus svcs plying CGA, it is not really becoz of structural failure in the long run, but whether they want to anot. Jewel Project would be the deciding factor, as it is a chance for CGA to construct a general DD-friendly int inside the "Jewel". It's not hard trust me. Don't gimme shit coz its equally painful and hard for the ppl to have to pack in, and for the buses to twist and turn at narrow alleyways inside the basement too. </p>
