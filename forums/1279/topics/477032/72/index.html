              <p>For a short distance route: yes. Bus should reach at least 65-70 pax, else Sd can manage.</p>
              <p>for long distance routes like 27, 39, 161 haven't I earlier said many times that even if bus gets 60 pax better to put DDs on them as people have to stand for long. </p>
              <p>You say "upper Aljunied can accommodate DDs" when SBST on its said "no".. But you are smarter than them... When asked then why 100 cannot have DDs, you have no reason to give...</p>
              <p>I actually take buses and note the loading levels, so I know better about the loading levels of buses than many of you here! So just zip your mouth.</p>

              <p>For commuters who are travelling from Upper Serangoon Road(the
              following bus stops: opp Glad Tidings Church, Serangoon JC, bef
              Nativity Church Ctr, Hougang Plaza and Blk 465A) to Rivervale area.
              They would prefer taking Service 136 as it provides faster
              connection if both buses tend to be back to back, the trend which I
              have observed last time but not sure for now. </p>
              <p>Same goes for Rivervale to Upper Serangoon Road/Kovan area, they
              would prefer taking Sv 136 unless the frequency screw up or Sv 119
              turns up first but if they do so, both services tend meet together
              at the junction of Upper Serangoon Road/Hougang Ave 7 and 8
              junction from what I have observed last time also. </p>
              <p>I think Service 82 can consider deploying DD on Sunday AM period
              or beef up the frequency. From what I have noticed, the loading is
              quite high and most of the time the bus tend to be fully packed.For
              commuters who are travelling from Sengkang area to Hougang Mall or
              Kovan area as it provides a faster and shorter link.<br> <br> Talking about Sv 80, 82, 119 and 136 (from my observation - I may
              be wrong)<br> - From Punggol Road (after TPE) to Kovan Station: Both Sv 82 and
              136 can be equally on par regarding the travelling time<br> <br> - From Sengkang East Way to Upper Serangoon Rd/Kovan: As mentioned
              above, Sv 136 is faster<br> <br> - From Punggol Road (Rivervale Plaza and Blk 412) to Upper
              Serangoon Rd/Kovan: Sv 82 is faster as compared to Sv 80</p>
              <p>- From Punggol Road (opp Blk 458, Punggol Park) to Upper
              Serangoon Rd/Kovan: Sv 119 is faster as compared to Sv 80 and 82.
              Sometimes Sv 82 can be on par with Sv 119. If the former drive
              faster than the latter.  </p>

              <p>Correct, but I did saw 2 of the bus packed to the doors around
              6:30-7:10pm. No seats were empty, passengers moved in...</p>
              <p>First bus arrive at the first stop, bus was alr packed to the
              door. 6-8 passengers managed to squeeze up..and the last 2 were at
              least standing on the "yellow box"..</p>
              <p>Next bus arrive, bus was also packed to the door. About 2-3
              managed to board. Situation were better unlike the first one I've
              seen...</p>
              <p>Like I've said, should have taken pictures to show...didn't know
              it was so hard to believe .__. </p>

              <p>Okay. Observe some more. Even I'll observe next time I am in the area. But I agree 5 buses is less. It can lead to sometimes prolonged gap between buses. 1 Citaro should be def added Nd if you observe consistent high load, DD can be added too. </p>

              <p>For a short distance route: yes. Bus should reach at least 65-70

              <p>for long distance routes like 27, 39, 161 haven't I earlier said
                          many times that even if bus gets 60 pax better to put DDs on them

                          100 cannot have DDs, you have no reason to give...</p>
              <p>I actually take buses and note the loading levels, so I know
                          better about the loading levels of buses than many of you here! So

              <p>27, 39 can't have DDs.</p>
              <p>100 does not have fleet restriction.</p>
              <p>Just put a stick on top of a SD so that it reaches the same height as a DD. Drive it on service 100 route and see if the stick hits anything.</p>
