              <p>This has been suggested multiple times... Crossover from 107/153 DDs returning to interchange can be used on 113A for sure, but LTA is against putting DDs on only the SWT of service if it does not have DDs otherwise.</p>

              <p>Currently, load is on Rivervale side. Even after PunggolmWest develops, I see not heavy usage of this service. Maybe loading between  Punggol Field and Compass Point will go up from 20-25 pax today, but I see few people will travel to Rivervale area from there sbs beyond. </p>

              <p>1. Sv 80 and 119 call at different stops within Sengkang. 80 does not go to Rivervale. For people living along Rivervale, who want to go to Kovan/Hougang, 119 does serve as an option. Am loading towards Kovan can be 55-60 pax. </p>
              <p>2. I get surprised every time you speak about 119 loading because 113 loading is much poorer than 119 between HG and Kovan plus unlike 119, 113 has many alternatives with 62/82/107/112 having a large part of its route in parallel. </p>
              <p>3. Just go clarify I am not advocating DDs on 119, but your point can only be taken seriously, when you start accepting that 113 route also has major fault between HG and Kovan.</p>

              <p>I think it does not really matter for people. If they see 119 or 136, whichever comes first, people will take to Rivervale. There will be hardly 2 minutes time difference in traveling time of both services. But if you miss one bus, the other bus might come after 5-7 mins.</p>
              <p>I have observed PM frequency for both 119 and 136 is 15-17 minutes.</p>

              <p>That would be ridiculous... wherever required just add extra buses..</p>
              <p>why would 291P and 293P loading be bad? Both have significant loading in AM/PM peak, do the same route, call at the same stop in the interchange. Ground staff at Tampines will make at least 40-45 pax board 291P before he brings the next bus forward.</p>
