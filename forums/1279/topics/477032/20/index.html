              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, I am an ordinary Singaporean taking public
              transport like all of you. I am not from LTA/MOT or any govt
              services. Nice to meet you here. Let's share any ideas you may have
              here. I am very positive to BusAnalyser and your idea of combining
              sbs 82/sbs 107 routes into 1 bus service. Please continue to write
              to LTA and make it a reality. I live in Punggol and the
              connectivity is not as good as other places. But I am very happy
              that the bus stop along TPE along Punggol is upcoming very soon.
              Many bus services are expected to ply along the bus
              stops. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For the current housing development in Punggol, it already has good connectivity, which has significantly improved over the last year. You gave new service 50 and 119 to  Punggol and so much increased capacity on 43, 34. </p>
              <p>The existing services do not get heavily packed in Punggol area. 3, 34, 43, 50, 82, 83, 136 all are able to manage the load well within Punggol area. Further commenting 50, 85, 119 are quite empty within Punggol region. Need for more services now? No. In future? Yes. Once Punggol west and north develop.</p>

              <p>147, 196 definitely have bi- directional loading because it reaches Cbd from both directions. 174 bi-directional is more between Bukit Batok and Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, Punggol poor connectivity la. Where got good connectivity? Significantly improved over last year does not automatically mean good connectivity. It was damn lousy last time. Just that it is improved a bit only. Sbs 119 is sort of redundant. It is such a short service and it just provides another alternative to sbs 82 and sbs 136. This route sbs 119 should have been extended to eunos or bedok for better catchment. What is needed is services to go to other places currently not served. No wonder no people la. Sbs 50 is sort of much better, but it is still quite long winding route to north area. Of course, must increase capacity on sbs 34 which has very high demand as it is one of the direct routes to tampines central. Sbs 34 timing and schedule is so ridiculous previously. 13 to 18 min! Crazy! Same goes for sbs 43. Ridiculous timing in the past. Buses should be every 10 min 1 bus. This is just getting back to normal. It does not mean it is improved a lot. Have you ever realized why some services in Punggol are not heavily packed? Because most are quite indirect long winding routes (3, 50, 62, 85, 136) to destinations which residents are put off. What we have always advocated are semi-express routes which are warmly appreciated. There is really no need to always wait for other parts of Punggol to get developed before we deserve a semi-express routes. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, the situation will improve very soon in a few months time. What the residents lobby for semi-express services is coming soon. It will be fulfilled by the existing services to stop at the new TPE bus stop. The demand should go up drastically. Cheers</p>

              fully agree as i have exactly the same thoughts. residents in Sengkang/Fernvale, Punggol, and even parts of Hougang and Pasir Ris can make use of this bus service to the west. but this svc should be express. or else defeat the purpose. via TPE&gt;Mandai Rd&gt;Yew Tee MRT&gt;Boon Lay(express). also can relieve the very overcrowded trains bet CCK to JE.

              <p>The converted rate that I mentioned was based on a carnet of
              10... Oysters cap is at 7 pounds a day... Convert in SGD... U will
              realize how expensive... I have worked in uk before... And studied
              in Paris... So I know how expensive I used to find public transport
              there compared to SG... I would prefer walking 1km to save on bus
              ride or transfer.</p>

              <p>Agreed 3 has painful loading at Pasir Ris MRT but if you observe, it will be left with 45-50 pax on TPE. Most alight in Pasir Ris itself. There is a new bunch that board on last stop of ave 1.</p>
