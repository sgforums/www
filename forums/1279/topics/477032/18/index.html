              <p>SMRT needs to get more bendies for the feeders (around 80 buses, to replace all the MK1 bendies and the remaining as fleet additions), and reconfigure the seating and standing spaces. The A24 could have the seats removed at the rear to fit in another PIW slot like on the original Lion City G. Currently its capacity is worst than the O405G, by configuring it correctly, it can actually accomodate up to 154 passengers, which is much better than a dd, and is ideal for feeder loadings.</p>
              <p>For the trunks, dds are ideal. 50 buses is not enough (if most are deployed to 190). SMRT needs around 150 dds (to partially replace the retiring O405s), so 40 of them could go to 190 and the others scattered around the trunks.</p>

              <p>I heard it will be an order of 200 DD buses. So even if major bulk goes for CBD buses, there would still be around 80-100 buses to match with bendies/rigids to make few needy services WAB. For example, 804/806 have so many old people living around there... I would have expected these services to go WAB years back, but cannot. Putting rigids on this service is just like putting rigids on 190. With frequency of already 3-4 mins... you cant even add more rigids.. will become classic case of bunch bunch bunch.</p>

              <p><br>Normally the KUBs on 147 are timed to tail the DD in front to take the extra leftover pax.. but these days with erratic schedules that is not happening.. in fact u see so much 147 DD bunching...  I also feel 147 DD BCs try to act funny by tailing each other and making a DD train.. observe so frequently 3 147 DDs in AM peak towards city on Bendemeer Rd (one of them is 147A)..</p>

              <p>Not taking over duty... it is more efficient deployment, use of buses like sv36...<br><br>Eg, BC1 waiting at bus terminal, bus comes in, BC2 alights from bus, BC1 takes over the bus and drives off after his mandated rest, BC2 will take his rest and wait for next bus to come in...<br><br>However there is another type in EUR, you dun see 4-5 buses waiting at bus terminal/bus stand area(as it is more commonly none esp UK), normally, there is only 1 bus the most 2 buses, after which they will drive off...<br><br>Closest you can find of the second type is Hong Kong, you can observe at Star Ferry and terminals over HK...</p>
