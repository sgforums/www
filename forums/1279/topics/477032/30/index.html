              <p>Yes 315 route is really weird. It comes out of North ave 1 and then goes back in towards Gardens Way rather than going down YCK Road, where people could also make faster transfer to other services like 43, 70, 76 etc instead of waiting to go all the way via Chomp Chomp.</p>

              <p><br>Yes you are right. But if 317 was the only service plying without 315, DDs could have been plied looping @ Chomp Chomp on 317A. 317A would be 2 buses, 317 wouold be 5 buses. Good enough!</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I understand your concern. But serangoon north ave 4/5 residents have it very bad for years already. Sbs 116 links them to serangoon as well as hougang ave 9 (hougang 1 mall) plus hougang central. More direct and much better as loading is not very high. Give them a comfortable journey which pleases the residents there. Cheers.</p>

              <p>From what I can see, they want make sbs 116 go to major road (yio Chu Kang road) faster to serangoon central. This will be faster than routing it through serangoon north ave 1 which will slow it down. So it sort of defeats the purpose of direct connection to serangoon mrt. Cheers</p>

              <p>I completely disagree on this point. When it turns onto AMK Ave 3, there are always 2/3 buses on the stop, and there is waiting time. Then it turns to YCK road. Here, it would go straight onto Serangoon North Ave 1 and directly connect to YCK road also providing Serangoon North Ave 1 residents direct connection to Serangoon MRT and YCK road to change to other services.</p>
              <p>When a particular service is introduced, it needs to benefit more than one estate. You cannot have a new service for every estate. Then area around MRT will go mad with buses pulling in and pulling out. Also then it would make 116 more usable and the stop opposite NEX would make complete sense as there would be little overlap with 43/70.</p>

              <p>Simple. </p>
              <p>1. Relieve loads on 72. Horrific amount of pax boarding 72 at HG, with half of them heading to Ave 4/9. 116 is a tool to relieve loads so that they can share between Ave 4/9 pax, allowing for more YCK bound pax to board. </p>
              <p>2. Simplify transfer. 116 enters the int while 72 does not. And yes, it is a disadvantage during rainy days. And isn't that LTA's aims, to provide for better alternatives?</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, okay I conceded to the first point. Re-routing it through serangoon north ave 1 then to yio Chu Kang will be a good choice as serangoon north ave 1 residents will benefit. Time incurred will be comparable to current route. Cheers</p>

Yes as per what you should say, these are inner routes. But it is also beneficial for the current sbs 116 route as services are needed to assist first on the major road hougang ave 9 as this place is not a very accessible part of hougang. Sbs 72 goes by it and sbs 116 is necessitated to help relieve load for this sector too enroute to serangoon north ave 4 to serangoon. The way I see it, it is a good route with less winding sector. I</span><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231; color: #000000;">nner routes are getting more and more important priorities these days and your suggestion seems logical.  What I can think of is they feel major roads come first priority rather than inner routes. Inner routes is still within walking distance to major roads.</span></div>

              <p>Hi mr 23ispolo, I think the 2 most likely reasons are because 1. the new HDB flats at rivervale crescent are up for more than 6 months already and that part of sengkang estate is badly linked. 2. The nearest major road within walking distance is rivervale drive. That major road only has LRT and sbs 86 (a bit winding to sengkang mrt). So no choice since only 1 main service sbs 86 on that major road, they have to introduce sbs 371 to go by rivervale drive and loop at rivervale crescent. In that sense, they give the major road rivervale drive 2 services and ply the inner route rivervale crescent as well. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone. Cheers</p>
