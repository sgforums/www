              <p>Is that the only way 120 can be modified? Think more... There
                      can be multiple other options... You can start at Rummi Tunggi
                      Terminal with new stops along Redhill Close and loop @ Tehlok
                      Blangah MRT via st 31/32... not possible? This way you provide
                      Tehlok Blangah and Redhill residents with direct MRT connectivity
                      to both EWL and CCL. Any duplication?</p>
              <p>113 - yes any bus you deploy will have some pax. But if you take
                      away a service, will anyone be really hurt apart from withdrawing
                      an extra service? Let's see 113. From HCI to HG ave 8, you have 74,
                      147 in parallel. From HG Ave 8 to Hougang MRT, you have 62, opp
                      side also 325 to HG MRT. Then you have 62/82/325/107 all going till
                      HG Ave 2 bus sop. You have 82/107 continue to Kovan. You have 112
                      join in on HG Ave 2 all the way parallel till HG St 21. Where is
                      the uniqueness of the route. Buses are deployed every 15/20 mins in
                      peak hours on this part because of 113A. If the route was useful,
                      113A would have got crossover buses from some other service. The
                      high loading point of 113 between Kovan and UPL has been ignored
                      with no fleet add or capacity upgrade because of Kovan-HG
                      sector.</p>
              <p>325 - If you do the right thing by taking away 113 from HG to
                      Kovan, 325 should be extended to HG St 21 as it looping back to
                      interchange is a waste. Those from that one stop along HG Ave 2
                      have 132 to HG Int, but most people who take MRT prefer to take MRT
                      at Kovan. Is there any pax from HG MRT stop to HG Int? No. There
                      are some transfer pax that alight at HG Ave 2 to transfer to
                      25/55/854 etc. And then some few board towards HCI.</p>

              <p>For 113, your thinking very selfish leh.</p>
              <p>I have seen 113 with a full load of students from hg side tduring the morning .  Most of them alight along hougang ave 1. Which is ard 20mins ride.</p>
              <p>In the afternoon chij students flood 113 also. Without 113, there is only one bus svc from lorong ah soo to hougang. For hougang ave 1 side i would say  115 is taking off the loads of 113 until 6.15pm</p>
              <p>If hougang street 11 can be converted into a bus terminal, i feel 113A can loop at terminate there and loop at kovan instead</p>
              <p>i would say the load from hougang are mostly students and church goers. There are of course the working class who take 113 to kovan and transfer. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, what you think is for the majority. But you also have to think of the minority, even if that only constitutes just handful of people. There are a few people who need to go from pandan gardens to teban gardens and vice versa. Some people cannot walk far and have no other transport. So the link between teban gardens and pandan gardens need to be there. You cannot expect 2 estates to be so near with absolutely no direct link. Previously sbs 241 is withdrawn and sbs 143 is re-routed to provide this link and also extended from teban garden terminal to jurong east interchange. So what you may think is useless loop wasting time may mean a lot to others. </p>

              <p>If I have to buy that argument, then it see the intra connectivity between most estates is extremely poor whether in east, west or north. Normally you need to do at least one transfer. Moreover, it is not job of a trunk to do this kind of connection for the few minority. Coming to Pandan Gardens, there are only two bus stops. One bus stop is walking distance to west coast from where 39,143 can be taken to Teban. The other is walking distance to Jurong townhall from where 79,143 can be taken to Pandan. Pandan is a really small estate unlike estates in  Tampines, Bedok, Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>They already withdrew sbs 241 a feeder service whose initial job was to provide the link and tweaked sbs 143 a trunk service to cover the stops at pandan gardens. If they really followed your suggestion to cut off pandan gardens from sbs 143, residents there will make noise and protest. I think just one service sbs 143 to link these 2 estates (no matter how small it may be) will not do any major harm. As I say, there are many elder citizens living in these 2 areas. You cannot expect them to walk. For goodness sake, give them a linking bus service at their doorstep between these 2 estates. </p>

              gardens and pandan gardens need to be there. You cannot expect 2
              estates to be so near with absolutely no direct link. Previously
              sbs 241 is withdrawn and sbs 143 is re-routed to provide this link
              and also extended from teban garden terminal to jurong east
              interchange. So what you may think is useless loop wasting time may
              mean a lot to others. </p>

              <p>If I have to buy that argument, then it see the intra
              connectivity between most estates is extremely poor whether in
              east, west or north. Normally you need to do at least one transfer.
              Moreover, it is not job of a trunk to do this kind of connection
              for the few minority. Coming to Pandan Gardens, there are only two
              bus stops. One bus stop is walking distance to west coast from
              where 39,143 can be taken to Teban. The other is walking distance
              to Jurong townhall from where 79,143 can be taken to Pandan. Pandan
              is a really small estate unlike estates in Tampines, Bedok, Boon
              Lay.</p>

              <p>To add on, the 2 pandan gardens bus stop only have sbs 51 and sbs 143. To take buses to jurong town hall road and west coast road and expect residents to always walk in to the inner parts of pandan gardens is not practical la. For your info, no sbs 39 plies there. If you mean sbs 79, sbs 79 does not go to the bus stop near pandan gardens portion of west coast road. It goes to west coast road nearby teban garden side. Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, to kill off the only direct linkage bus service between 2 nearby areas less than 800 metres apart is considered spoonfed to you? Next time when your house area has a direct linkage to the next estate is withdrawn and you will feel deeply aggreived by it. Sbs 143 is the so called direct link in between the 2 areas. They are not having 5 to 6 direct doorstep services. So please give the residents there a break. </p>

              <p>Is that the only way 120 can be modified? Think more... There
              can be multiple other options... You can start at Rummi Tunggi
              Terminal with new stops along Redhill Close and loop @ Tehlok
              Blangah MRT via st 31/32... not possible? This way you provide
              Tehlok Blangah and Redhill residents with direct MRT connectivity
              to both EWL and CCL. Any duplication?</p>
              <p>113 - yes any bus you deploy will have some pax. But if you take
              away a service, will anyone be really hurt apart from withdrawing
              an extra service? Let's see 113. From HCI to HG ave 8, you have 74,
              147 in parallel. From HG Ave 8 to Hougang MRT, you have 62, opp
              side also 325 to HG MRT. Then you have 62/82/325/107 all going till
              HG Ave 2 bus sop. You have 82/107 continue to Kovan. You have 112
              join in on HG Ave 2 all the way parallel till HG St 21. Where is
              the uniqueness of the route. Buses are deployed every 15/20 mins in
              peak hours on this part because of 113A. If the route was useful,
              113A would have got crossover buses from some other service. The
              high loading point of 113 between Kovan and UPL has been ignored
              with no fleet add or capacity upgrade because of Kovan-HG
              sector.</p>
              <p>325 - If you do the right thing by taking away 113 from HG to
              Kovan, 325 should be extended to HG St 21 as it looping back to
              interchange is a waste. Those from that one stop along HG Ave 2
              have 132 to HG Int, but most people who take MRT prefer to take MRT
              at Kovan. Is there any pax from HG MRT stop to HG Int? No. There
              are some transfer pax that alight at HG Ave 2 to transfer to
              25/55/854 etc. And then some few board towards HCI.</p>

              YCK corridor choose to board at NEX and not at 147 stop. This stop
              is mostly used by pax who live along HG Ave 8. On way to Serangoon
              in AM, you have 43/70/116/147 all buses because anyone who is at
              Toho Green stop can choose between 4 services. In PM, it is
              different. People can't dance between the stops of 116, 43/70, 147
              - 3 different stops, with all rush coming to NEX. <strong>It is

              about more buses on NEX, there is a solution. When you merge
              82/107, you anyway have one service less to call. Alternately,
              route 81/82 via Boundary road and Opp Nex bus stop and then heading

              <p>btw, NOT all sv43/70 buses are bursting with paxes for every PM trip from NEX.. and LTA motive of putting sv116 at the opposite bus stop is for sv116 to cater to particular sector of paxes...</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, i am afraid public buses are not always taken by well built people. There are others to take care of. Not every person wants go to the teban gardens by the roadside jurong town hall rd. Some want go inner portion of teban gardens and that distance is easily 800 metres. Public bus is to relieve people from all the inconvenience. When a route is planned, there is an objective. Sbs 241 was the initial feeder service. Due to the feeder service using up resources. Sbs 143 was rerouted to cover sbs 241 objective on its way and sbs 241 is withdrawn. It serves its current purpose and you want it amended not to ply pandan gardens and ask people to transfer for a short distance of 800 metres?  What logic? Now the trend is to introduce new buses ply those inner routes just like sbs 121 plying kim tian road. Why not ask everybody walk from tiong bahru mrt to kim tian road and amend sbs 121 to ply the main road instead?</p>

              <p><br> so what if it is full only on one trip. That trip we have to ensure
              people are able to take a bus and even enter the bus. Why now you
              have a mindset that every bus should have demand? If LTA makes
              small changes like making 116 call at NEX, it will relieve off some
              pressure from 43/70. You want one bus 116 to go with only 15/20 pax
              in PM peak and then you want 43/70 to have 100 pax. Good
              thinking!</p>

              <p>hello, pls read carefully, i did not say that every bus need to have demand.do not put words in my mouth, i am saying that the bus resources are wasted if u keep on adding more buses on the same services....as in, you put one more bus on sv45 and it only help on one trip in AM peak/PM peak only while the other few trips are quite empty... SBST is actually doing quite well with its planning, but then they cant keep on committing too many buses onto one particular route without taking into consideration the return journey etc..</p>
              <p>Ppl keep on saying add more buses will resolve the capacity issues, but then, what about the return journey (let say Sv70 from shenton way in am peak).. most of the buses are empty...  that why SBST have to come up with so many "A" or "B" services instead to resolve the issues..</p>

              <p>see.. you are pampering those ppl at Toho Green...2 bus services
              is more than enough.. why would they need so many bus services from
              the MRT? why would you want to make Sv116 full of paxes travelling
              from Nex to YCK road (toho green) and thus preventing those paxes
              alighting at serangoon north ave 4/5 from boarding at nex? there
              are lots of area with only one pathetic service to/fro mrt. might
              as well ask LTA to ensure that all areas have at least 2 bus
              services to serve a MRT station? </p>
              <p>btw, NOT all sv43/70 buses are bursting with paxes for every PM
              trip from NEX.. and LTA motive of putting sv116 at the opposite bus
              stop is for sv116 to cater to particular sector of paxes...</p>

              <p>Hi All, let's all not forget the objective of why a new service is introduced and keep thinking of amending and straying away from the initial objective and have it later withdrawn and adding into unwanted disputes. Sbs 116 was introduced with the main objective of serangoon north ave 4 and ave 5 residents faster and more direction connection to serangoon in mind after numerous complaints. Of course other secondary aims along the routes are noted which still pick up people. </p>
