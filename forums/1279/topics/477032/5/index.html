              <p><br> agree. thats what i feedback to LTA before. i think a new
              centralised ADD friendly bus hub at CGA is good enough. just build
              next to CGA MRT stn. pax from all PTB just take skytrain to the bus
              hub/MRT stn. it can help cut down some buses from every route and
              improve effciency. also can save manpower by police to man each
              gantry leading to the existing PTB.</p>

              <p>I wrote a feedback regarding this same idea to CAG when they firstly announced about project jewel some months back on this and they mentioned that they would forward this feedback to the project team to look into it.</p>
              <p>Project Jewel is the prime location for such an interchange, since it has skytrain connectivity to both T2 and T3 (the skytrain passes through the building) and 5 minutes walking distance from T1. CGA MRT station is right below as well.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately from the latest press release in Dec they mentioned that "There will be facilities dedicated to the fly-cruise and fly-coach passenger segment..." and nothing about a transport interchange.</p>
              <p>They did mention about it being "a node that improves connectivity between Terminals 1, 2, 3 and the Changi Airport MRT station." though, but not sure in what ways.</p>

              <p>Being quite a regular commuter of 27, the maximum amount of buses that I have ever missed is 3 buses. Because the first bus, which is late, just alighted passengers and left, leaving the next bus, which bunched up behind to pick up passengers. Then the 3rd bus that bunched up arrived behind and skipped the stop, much to everyone's annoyance. But usually you wouldn't be able to board the first bus, because nowadays the commuters of 27 are very smart, all crowd around at the door area so they can board. And when the bus arrive they usually push their way in. Also after 8.30PM, the average frequency of 27 buses is 10-15mins (towards Hougang Int), and the buses are very full.</p>

              <p>at least sv27 have such good frequency in addition to those Sv27A buses (and downroute buses) as well..... with good frequency, bunching is unavoidable, esp when the bus are stuck at each bus stop for few mins due to irresponsible passengers who refuse to move in and who insist on standing near the entrance..</p>
              <p>and at night time, almost every service have bad frequency......</p>

              ya agree. the T1 bus basement design is pre-1980s and looking at the vast airport development and population increase over the years, the design is already long out-dated. and still must tahan the exhaust fumes when waiting for the bus inside the basement and cross the driveway to and fro which is unsafe. CGA really needs an aircon bus hub. a new bus hub also provide more decent rest place for bus captains and buses to park.

              <p>Actually truth to be told, buses are actively promoted, just not the public buses.</p>
              <p>As a tourist, if you dont want to take MRT there is a hotel transfer option that uses the 9 seater T3 livery coasters/rosa minibus. A direct trip from the airport to the hotel costs just $9 sgd.</p>

              <p>Okay, where to begin...</p>
              <p>Firstly, there is no need to insult of course. Okay I'm sorry for using hersh words, but all these are going out to show how simply selfish you are. I mean, why not YOU try to take 27 everyday during PM peak? </p>
              <p>And now the frequency. Good frequency, but all bunched up! So people end up waiting nearly 20 mins for a bunch of buses! Okay so it's good frequency, but due to jams and all that the frequency has lost its advantage! Imagine if there are DDs, each bus can take more load, and less bunching will occur. And some of the SDs can be deployed to other svcs!</p>
              <p>Take 27 transfer 34? 53 to 89? Problem is, transfer to WHERE? Half the busloaf unloads at Blk 190C bus stop to change to other svcs, do you think anyone will want to take 34? And do you know how much time is wasted for 53 to 89? And BTW, 53 has severe crowding issues at CGA too. </p>
              <p>Did I expect everyone to have seats? I will tell you, no. But would you like to be literally packed like sardines or worse still, miss buses? I doubt so. </p>

              <p>Okay, where to begin...</p>
              <p>Firstly, there is no need to insult of course. Okay I'm sorry
              for using hersh words, but all these are going out to show how
              simply selfish you are. I mean, why not YOU try to take 27 everyday
              during PM peak? </p>
              <p>And now the frequency. Good frequency, but all bunched up! So
              people end up waiting nearly 20 mins for a bunch of buses! Okay so
              it's good frequency, but due to jams and all that the frequency has
              lost its advantage! Imagine if there are DDs, each bus can take
              more load, and less bunching will occur. And some of the SDs can be
              deployed to other svcs!</p>
              <p>Take 27 transfer 34? 53 to 89? Problem is, transfer to WHERE?
              Half the busloaf unloads at Blk 190C bus stop to change to other
              svcs, do you think anyone will want to take 34? And do you know how
              much time is wasted for 53 to 89? And BTW, 53 has severe crowding
              issues at CGA too. </p>
              <p>Did I expect everyone to have seats? I will tell you, no. But
              would you like to be literally packed like sardines or worse still,
              miss buses? I doubt so. </p>

              <p>Pls lah.. you sound as if i have not taken bus before? i dun think u even try taking those non aircon buses which squeeze like sardines in the past?  loud engines, dirty interior etc... </p>
              <p>jams? which roads not jam in Singapore and which bus services are not affected by jam/traffic light etc etc? and u sound as if sv27 buses alway come at 20 mins frequency with 3-4 buses together.. it does happen but does not apply to every trip... </p>
              <p>depending on where u want to go... there are way to transfer buses... u need to be flexible....</p>
              <p>if u r talking about packed sardines buses or missed buses, there are other services which have much more bad frequency and more packed.....</p>
