              <p>seat belts is for the school children which these buses might be fetching...</p>
              <p>if u fail down due to your own carelessness, you cant claim anything.... else, u can claim from the insurance.. obviously, these operators of PPSS have to apply for PTO license and therefore they need to have the necessary insurance as well.</p>
              <p>this is a stop gap measure, until the second batch of BSEP came in... </p>

              <p>BC1 maybe drive 7420 and arrive at YCK terminal, another BC (who does not take out any bus from depot) will take over7420 and drive off.. BC1 will rest and then wait for the sv72 bus (let say 7421) to arrive and take that bus... BC2 of 7421 will then wait for the next bus to arrive to take the next bus... so no fixed bus... doing this, they save one bus and save space at terminal, as bus wont be parking long there...</p>

              <p>BC1 maybe drive 7420 and arrive at YCK terminal, another BC (who
                          does not take out any bus from depot) will take over7420 and drive

                          to arrive and take that bus... BC2 of 7421 will then wait for the
                          next bus to arrive to take the next bus... so no fixed bus... doing
                          this, they save one bus and save space at terminal, as bus wont be

              <p>No comment. No.</p>
              <p>In a "normal" service, unless the BC is given ad-hoc instructions by his superior he is to drive that same assigned bus throughout the day.</p>

              <p>Any delays can result in a knock on effect, by virtue of BCs at the destination being dependent on the timely arrival of the next assigned bus for a timely departure.</p>
