              <p>Hi mr SMB145B, if your point is to illustrate the feeder and trunk services for teban gardens and pandan gardens issue, I understand. For sbs 143 to be re-routed to skip pandan gardens, a new feeder service must originate from jurong east interchange to loop at teban gardens and pandan gardens. There is no way you cannot remove the current linkage without providing an alternative. That defeats the purpose of public transport. Thanks.</p>

              YCK road residents.... so if sv116 really amended to call at Nex

              <p>Sbs 116, sbs 43, sbs 70 and sbs 147 brings people from different parts of serangoon to YCK road. The purpose of sbs 116 is not to alleviate sbs 43 and sbs 70 situation. If a passenger wants a less crowded bus, he or she can just walk across the road to take sbs 116. If he prefers the crowded sbs 43 and sbs 70, by all means stay put at NEX stop. Sbs 116 is there because of numerous people staying at serangoon north ave 4 and 5 having much poorer connectivity to serangoon. You cannot sacrifice this crowd of people to serve others. Public transport is never intended to be this way. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, nice to hear from you. Just curious to know which area you live in Singapore? What is your most favourite bus service number? Last time my favourite was sbs 7 when I stayed holland. It brings me directly to orchard in less than 10 minutes. Currently it is sbs 50. Look forward to hearing from you. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I do not change topic. It is my practice to know more of a person and it is always good to chat with a person online when we are discussing topics. Since you head a sales operation, you should know two way communication is vital and sometimes we should also self-introduce ourselves a bit more. So is it not convenient for you to say where you live at? It does not need to be precise. Just an approximation. For example, sengkang, Opp mrt. Cheers</p>

              <p>It depends when did you see this. Before BSEP, sv 79 had a fleet of 9 buses with majority SDs. Now, it is a fleet of 12 buses with 10 DDs and only 2 SDs. Moreover, 143 is also almost full fleet DD. Hence, it would be rear that people at Teban will not be able to board a bus anymore. I agree when 79 had majority SDs, and a 143 has not called, a lot of pax would be left behind. But this is history now. AM peak, 79 almost comes empty from Penjuru and gets a good 60-70 pax at Teban Gardens stops.</p>
              <p>Hence, I don't think there is a need for either 78 or a new service for Teban Gardens.</p>

              <p>sv 30 &lt;Bedok to Boon Lay&gt;</p>

              <p>AYE -- Teban Gardens Crescent (new stop) -- Penjuru Rd (new stop) -- West Coast Rd -- Teban Gardens -- Pandan Gardens -- West Coast Rd</p>
              <p>** This way Penjuru rd residents get sv 30 in both directions</p>
              <p>** Also sv 30 is available to Teban Garden residents in both directions</p>
              <p>** Sv 143 goes direct from Teban Gardens to West Coast Rd (not doing the Pandan loop), providing lesser travel time. I know while doing this sv 30 run time will increase, and the 1 bus less on sv 143 can be given to sv 30. I could only think of this alternative to connect Pandan and Teban for those 2 people who travel within 2 estates. LOL.</p>

              i remembered a newspaper article reported that one reason sv116 was introduced is to provide alternative to sv 315 which sometimes experience terrible traffic jams at Sgoon Gdns area and sv 315 route is more winding.
