              <p>I do agree that it's high time now that Sv 518 gets a new fleet
              add. Its last fleet add was like 4 years ago (2699Y was the bus
              then IIRC). But i would rather they add a full-day bus to Sv 518
              rather than a S-Shift or even E-Shift.</p>
              <p>Because Sv 518's crowds differs heavily depending on the events
              along its route (think along the line of the events along TP,
              Orchard, Suntec etc), and those aren't exactly conforming to the
              regular office-working hours imo..</p>

              <p>Agreed. </p>
              <p>Just what I was thinking. </p>
              <p>Flexibility just isn't there. Who says demand will only come weekday peak? 518 could be equally or even more packed than those timings on weekends! I know because very few would miss the bus on weekdays but more than 30 people would miss the bus on weekend nights, when there are no S shift and E shift! An extra weekend/PH full day would do 518 good imo.</p>

              <p>Flexibility just isn't there. Who says demand will only come
              weekday peak? 518 could be equally or even more packed than those
              timings on weekends! I know because very few would miss the bus on
              weekdays but more than 30 people would miss the bus on weekend
              nights, when there are no S shift and E shift! An extra weekend/PH
              full day would do 518 good imo.</p>

              <p>I'm going abit OT in my reply to yours, but I think they need to look at those Airport-bound svcs and their frequencies beyond the usual working hours too. <br><br>Because somehow I observed the Airport staff's change of shift hours at night are somewhere around 8pm &amp; after that, but by that time they wait for the bus at CGA PTBs, the usual fleet adds &amp; excess buses on the Airport-bound svcs are no longer running. So that's why it's very often I see super packed buses from the Airport everyday (worse on Weekends) after 8pm or so~ </p>

              <p>Hi! </p>
              <p>I was quite annoyed about the long frequencies of buses 187 and 188 along Bukit Batok West Ave 4, the two bus services long frequencies caused a built up of students along that stretch as my school is on that stretch.And when the bus arrive, both buses 187 and 188 arrive at the same time and both were MAN NL323F that was almost filled to the brim. I managed to squeezed up Svc 188 but my friend could not board as the doors close and was forced to wait for the 2nd bus of the same service, same goes for Svc 187.</p>
              <p>I hope this BSEP can do something to this services during school times, I also hope that SMRT can add trips around noon time for these services and work with MOE to finally work out a plan.</p>

              <p>off peak and weekend demand would be low since it only serves the shenton way financial district. Full day ops possible under a route variant that serves more areas such as suntec, mbs and harbourfront. hopefully something like this can be done for other city direct or similar routes (65x, 850E, 982E, 951E), especially 850E and 951E. Similar to sbst's cityshopper routes last time, but charging express instead of premium fares.</p>

              <p>I think everyone here who feels strongly should write to both SBST and LTA for introducing DDs. I am sure they can start with 2 DDs to try out.</p>
              <p>502 on the other hand can also get more DDs especially on weekends... Just 2 DDs is not enough for this service.</p>
