              <p>Am I the only one who feels that 8 needs even more DDs/frequency update and 518 needs at least a DD to cater to the crowd at Blk 302 Tamp Ave 2 during morning peak? After taking them for more than 2 years, I noticed that majority of the pax either came from Tamp North (28) or Pasir Ris East (39,17,12). So there are a large number of pax trying to board 8 (consession card users) DDs, which are normally 1/3 full (half for KUBs).</p>
              <p>Then we look at the pax taking 518. 1/3 - 1/2 of them are usually going to CBD, the rest is usually going to TP. Normally when 518 reachs Blk 302, it has enough space for at most 20 pax. So the TP crowd board them (the buses normally come together), and normally, some will be left behind.</p>
              <p>Then we look at the 5 stops between Blk 302 and TP. In those 5 stops, there seems to be people trying to board the bus. The thing is, for 518, half of those who can't board the bus (because it is already full) looks like they are going to CBD area!</p>
              <p>DDs for 518 is still up to debate, I guess, cause sometimes, I can barely board it at Loyang, and sometimes, the bus is (quite) empty at Morning peak.</p>

              <p>They are.</p>
              <p>But it is likely that when they are operated by the PTOs, they are in fact "handed-over" in the formal sense.</p>
              <p>A similar procedure would have to occur (in vice-versa sense) when LTA "takes back" these assets.</p>
              <p>So what is likely is that the BSEP buses to be used in the tender packages would have been deployed to the 2 PTOs prior to the "re-shuffling".</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, frankly I do not know if they consider CDS and PPSS as new services. As of now, they have implemented 18 new services (route extension with BSEP is considered), 10 CDS and 9 PPSS. Not too sure the 10 CDS and 9 PPS are part of the initial 40 new services because they are operated by private operators and do not take the 800 buses (550 paid for by govt, 250 by operators) into account. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes I agree. That is why I was also furious initially when I see some route extensions considered as new service (sbs 119) and also some express service (sbs 513) counted in. However when I think further, I realise that it is not really possible to introduce 40 total brand new routes in tiny Singapore. I just treat this as sort of a cover-up for the bus rationalization for NEL. </p>
              <p>Then news came later that they are going to implement 80 new services (40 from 2012 to end 2014 and 40 from 2015 to 2016 with recruitment and training of drivers). So that helps to cover for the way that they brand as new services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>A similar procedure would have to occur (in vice-versa sense)

              <p>17, 89, 95, 96 - managing well</p>
              <p>93 - ok for frequency beef up but otherwise loading is well managed. So not priority.</p>
              <p>99 - already 2 BSEP WEG add.. How many more u want?</p>
              <p>112 - ok for now... Once flats along ave 7 complete, can get 2 DDs and 1 BSEP add</p>
              <p>113 - yes should have S shift BSEP add with operation on 113A during its working hours</p>
              <p>115 - should be extended to HGDEP via Defu with 3 buses</p>
              <p>145 - how many more buses to add? What it needs is DDs...</p>
              <p>173 - agreed... Just need 1 MAN</p>
              <p>187/189 - no need for MAN... Hopefully will get DDs... Need high capacity buses. Period!</p>
              <p>800 - first take off those bennies, make it all rigid and then add BSEP.</p>
              <p>811 - ok but really needs more Bendies. Cannot have due to WAB status</p>
              <p>812 - need one more bendy from SMRT side... Not BSEP add please. MAN cannot take the load.</p>
              <p>851 - no BSEP... If BSEP only dd add... Needs DDs/ Bendies... Not rigids</p>
              <p>852 - can even be withdrawn.. It is a big bonus that the service is still around.. No need to waste resource on this one</p>
              <p> 882 - yes please, really need BSEP add for this service.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I agree for sbs 518. Actually the frequency of this service is supposed to be in such a way as it brings residents from pasir ris, tampines and a portion of bedok to the city area all at one time. Its main aim is not to connect pasir ris to tampines or tampines to bedok. There are many other connections for bus services which serve pasir ris to tampines or tampines to bedok or pasir ris to bedok depending on where you are at (which part) and where you want to go (which part). Cheers.</p>
