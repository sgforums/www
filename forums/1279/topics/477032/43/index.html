              <p>SMRT, please use your own MANs or O405s for this service 912P...
                          Coaches which operate on an SMRT route is really too odd, like
                          having Woodlands Transport coaches on Sentosa bus services, which
                          confuses passengers, as they don't think it is even on

              <p>If SMRT Buses and SBS Transit have sufficient resources, there won't be a need for PPSS in the first place.</p>
              <p>Of course LTA could have specified for citybuses to be operated in the PPSS contracts, but I suppose most of the operators do not have citybuses in their fleet, or/and costs was a more important consideration for LTA.</p>
              <p>SMRT Buses did bid for a few PPSS routes (under Bus Plus), but have not won any contracts so far.</p>

              <p>Neither does SBS Transit nor SMRT Buses want private operators to drive their buses.</p>

              <p>Even if you want to train private drivers for "conversion", there is insufficient buses in SBS Transit or SMRT Buses' inventory.</p>
              <p>It is probably more cost effective to "hire" a private bus to operate during peak period temporarily until a more permanent solution is found, than to get an additional brand-new BSEP bus which is left lying around in the depot  during off-peak hours. And then there's the issue of finding an additional space for the new bus.</p>

              <p>if lta want pte operator to have standard of sbst smrt, it will have to take time as pte operators need to buy in buses that not like coach bus. something like ex-smrt yutong. need money and time and also if the contract is short period then no use, waste money.</p>
              <p>i think the advantage of pte operator is human touch that mean if old people board the bus the driver can ask them nicely to sit in front and allight in front instead at the back.</p>
              <p>next best things is lta let pte operators is to t-loan new buses it brought for the main operators. just put on lta logo on the bus will do after the contract over return back to lta.   </p>

              <p>912P contract is worth 1.15mil for 2 year.<br>which is 0.575 mil per year, and 11000 per week, 2200 per day...</p>
              <p>Total 22 trips each day, which mean LTA is paying the pte operator S$100 PER TRIP. of course the pte operator are willing to do it during peak hour as it is sure win situation for them... If the pte operator are not being paid by LTA and instead, based on the fare collection, will they want to operate these PPSS instead?? 45 pax x 76 cents = 34.20/trip (taking max fare , instead of the Distance Related Fare).  if half of the pax are those transfer paxes who are paying 5 cents or 10 cents, how much can the operators earn?? </p>
              <p>so u really want the private operators to take over the full route, then LTA (and in turn we the tax payers) have to pay more taxes to subsidy the private operators. so ppl make noise when LTA buy new buses for SBST/SMRT, and no one make noise about the profit that the private operators make when LTA awarded these contracts?</p>
