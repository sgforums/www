              <p>Not taking over duty... it is more efficient deployment, use of
              buses like sv36...<br> <br> Eg, BC1 waiting at bus terminal, bus comes in, BC2 alights from
              bus, BC1 takes over the bus and drives off after his mandated rest,
              BC2 will take his rest and wait for next bus to come in...<br> <br> However there is another type in EUR, you dun see 4-5 buses waiting
              at bus terminal/bus stand area(as it is more commonly none esp UK),
              normally, there is only 1 bus the most 2 buses, after which they
              will drive off...<br> <br> Closest you can find of the second type is Hong Kong, you can
              observe at Star Ferry and terminals over HK...</p>

              <p>Most of the services linking towns to towns with close to 40% of routes(SBST/SMRT) bypass the city... <br><br>Most trunk routes are bi directional, goes the same for 190.851.966 during certain hours...<br><br>190 is unique coz after certain timings, both directions are heavily utilised<br><br></p>

              <p>I suggested an express service from Orchard as well... May be
              you chose to ignore that... I don't think every time introducing

              Tanah Merah-Bedok south and not for orchard-cga express? If you
              take 36 you will notice, no one takes it from Orchard to cga... It
              is such a waste of time.. Need a service from orchard to cga via
              ECP... This way even people with bags / living in hotels can take
              bus to airport.</p>

              <p>Oh I may have overlooked the express service from orchard to CGA but I do not think there is a necessity. Sbs 36 is designed adequately to bring marine parade residents to CGA and it is sufficiently loaded at the moment. I forget to say if you switched the routes of sbs 36 and sbs 48, then sbs 16 and sbs 36 new route will look quite similar. </p>

Let's share any ideas you may have here. I am very positive to BusAnalyser and your idea of combining sbs 82/sbs 107 routes into 1 bus service. Please continue to write to LTA and make it a reality. I live in Punggol and the connectivity is not as good as other places. But I am very happy that the bus stop along TPE along Punggol is upcoming very soon. Many bus services are expected to ply along the bus stops. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, you tell me to come out and explain to you and introduce myself in this forum. I have heeded your advice and done that. I do not hide anything and have told you I am not from LTA/MOT or any govt services. So please do not keep linking me to any govt services and any politics. I am just a fun-loving public transport guy having my own opinion of bus services. Thanks. </p>
