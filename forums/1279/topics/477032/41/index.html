              <p>The government is still hesitant on a common government livery
                      because they still want to project the perception that bus
                      operations are still in the hands of private operators (i.e. any
                      blame can be deflected to the private sector).</p>
              <p>However, the recent BSEP stickers provides some clue to the
                      government toying with and accepting such an idea if it gives them
                      credit and benefits them politically.</p>
              <p>Quite a few cities have moved towards adopting a common
                      government livery for its buses (see below, Melbourne). And
                      personally I <em>do</em> want a model where the government owns and
                      lease public buses as well.</p>

              <p><br> Common livery has been in use by Transperth for quite a long time. It doesn't matter if the routes are operated by Swan Transit, Path Transit or Veolia Transdev.</p>
              <p>I feel SG bus fleet should be <a href="/forums/1279/topics/467046">nationalised and re-contracted out according to sectors</a>. In SG, there are roughly 7 sectors that can be tendered out, with WTS getting an outside chance of having PTO status like SBS &amp; SMB. To avoid discontent, however, Sembawang (WDL/SBW/YSN route groups) and Hougang (HGN/SKG/PGL route groups) contract areas should remain with their existing operators.</p>
              <p>Other contract areas include East Coast (EUN/BDK/TAM/PSR), Tanglin (City area, Redhill, Whampoa), West Coast (QUE/CLE/JUE/BNL), Bukit Batok (BBT/BPJ/CCK) and Ang Mo Kio (AMK/SER/BSH/TPY). These can be farmed out by competitive tender process.</p>

              <p>Actually, in my opinion, I feel that the bus services should be tendered out based on depots - instead of which area they run in.</p>
              <p>Since there has been new depots (bus parks) created over the years, the Government should review the allocation of bus services to every bus depot. Thereafter, it should contract out the bus depot, where <strong>bus companies would bid to operate bus depots, and run bus services that are allocated to the bus depots</strong>.</p>
              <p>Currently, SBS Transit has <a title="6 bus depots" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/download/SBST_AnnualReport13_a.pdf">6 bus depots</a> [page 80] (bus parks) and SMRT has <a title="3 bus depots" href="http://www.smrt.com.sg/Portals/0/PDFs/About%20SMRT/Investor%20Relations/Annual%20Report/AR2013/SMRT%20Annual%20Report%202013.pdf">3 bus depots</a> [page 200] - of which SBS Transit can use its Soon Lee bus depot until 2030, its Bukit Batok bus depot until 2026 and its Ang Mo Kio bus depot until 2020, and SMRT can use its Woodlands bus depot until 2027. In addition, SMRT can use the Wenya/Bulim bus depot from 2015.</p>
              <p>The bus depots (bus parks) at Defu Ave 1, Ang Mo Kio Street 62 and Kranji Road can be used until 2016, whereas the ones at Bedok North Ave 4 and Ayer Rajah Crescent are under Temporary Occupation Licence.</p>
              <p>Based on the expiry of leases, I guess the<strong> two</strong> depots (Bedok North and Ayer Rajah) on Temporary Occupation License will be the first to be opened for bus contracts model, followed by the <strong>three</strong> depots (Defu, Ang Mo Kio [SMRT] and Kranji) that would have the leases expired in 2016.</p>
              <p>After 2016, SBS Transit will probably continue to operate the bus depots (and associated bus services) at Soon Lee, Bukit Batok and Ang Mo Kio - until their respective leases expire.</p>
              <p>After 2016, SMRT will probably continue to operate the bus depots (and associated bus services) at Woodlands and Wenya/Bulim - until their respective leases expire.</p>
              <p>In short, the contract areas with most bus services from the above 5 bus depots (that will probably continue to be operated by the respective operator) will most likely have the bus services remain the same in the initial phase of Bus Contracts Model; for a start, around half of the bus services in Singapore will be opened for competitive bidding, while the other half will be opened up progressively thereafter as the current leases expire.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I guess the liveries on the buses owned by both SBS Transit and SMRT will very soon start to be re-painted to a common livery (based on Downtown Line, I guess the livery will spot the LTA logo, instead of Transitlink logo). I guess the government will plan carefully and start re-painting the buses (if it decides on common livery) and (possibly) give the buses new registration plates by a certain time, such that when the contracts model begins, a certain percentage of the buses would already have the common livery. <em><span style="color: #888888;">(With that, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I think SMRT can halt the painting of its new livery on buses already, to avoid wasting money.)</span></span></em></p>

              <p>When the Bus Contracts Model is here, there is something I wish can happen:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the labor (workers) of both SBS Transit and SMRT that work in the depots and/or drive the bus can become workers of LTA - similar to the revenue assets (bus and depot) taken over by LTA.</span></p>
              <p>because in bus contracts model, the bus companies compete with each other to bid to run bus services.</p>
              <p>If bus company change (another bus company run the bus service) and if the workers belong to the first bus company, the workers from the second bus company will come in and take over the job of the workers of the first bus company, leading to unemployment of the first bus company's workers. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">This may result in many people not having a long-term job, as they will only have job when their bus company win the license to run bus services and they are needed to man (drive, maintain, etc.) the buses. If their bus company lose the license, they themselves also will lose their job. </span></p>
              <p>To prevent unemployment (or at least minimize it) and to ensure (most of) the workers of SBS Transit and SMRT can continue to have long-term employment, I wish the workers can be taken in by LTA and work for LTA (the wages and salary also standardized and from LTA), instead of work for SBS Transit or SMRT. </p>
              <p>Similar to the buses, the workers can become fixed assets of LTA, as they sign on employment contacts with LTA.</p>
              <p>This way, the workers can have a stable rice bowl. Even if change bus company as a result of Bus Contracts Model, it would not affect their rice bowl, since they are working for LTA, not the bus company. </p>
              <p>After all, the Bus Contracts Model is meant "<a title="to drive efficiency and for the market to discover the best prices for a set of services" href="https://www.reach.gov.sg/YourSay/DiscussionForum/tabid/101/mode/3/Default.aspx?ssFormAction=%5B%5BssBlogThread_VIEW%5D%5D&amp;tid=%5B%5B14071%5D%5D">to drive efficiency and for the market to discover the best prices for a set of services</a>". The emphasis is on how the bus company manages its operations and employs the assets it is allocated.</p>
              <p>Some may argue that this may result in workers taking sides (working hard for the bus company if they like it, while they give a terrible work for the bus company if they do not like it) or simply become complacent, since their rice bowl would not be affected when another bus company takes over the operation of the bus services.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Well, if the workers dare to deliver a horrible service, they will face the consequences - just that it will be from LTA, instead of the bus company. After all, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">he buses and workers are assets of LTA. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If a bus is destroyed in accident, LTA will replace it with a new bus. Likewise if a worker does not work or has failed to do a proper job, LTA will ask the worker to resign. Since the bus and workers would belong to LTA, LTA will be the one making sure they are suitable for operations.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="color: #808080;">For instance, LTA can itself employ "auditors" to review the data recorded by the Intelligent Bus Management System to check for flaws and ensure coherence. Should the "auditors" realize that a particular driver has been late or too early when driving the bus, LTA will have that driver replaced with another driver. For the workers at bus depot, LTA can do regular checks on the quality of their service, such as collecting data on how many buses return to depot for un-planned maintenance (which indicates how well the technicians upkeep the buses). Whereas for the workers at bus interchanges - which work as counter staff and/or service ambassadors - LTA can check on them like how 7-Eleven does it, by sending "mystery shoppers" to observe their services. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The workers will be monitored by LTA, while the bus company manage the bus operations and decide the deployment of buses and workers. </span></p>
              <p>In short, I wish that the workers of SBS Transit and SMRT can be taken over and become workers of LTA, just like the buses, when the Bus Contracts Model is here. </p>
              <p>In the Bus Contracts Model, the LTA should be the one procuring the equipment and hiring the workers, and subsequently monitor and handle them.</p>
              <p>The bus company should instead emphasize on managing the deployment of assets <span style="color: #808080;">(including managing how many workers work in a shift)</span>, how the bus services should run <span style="color: #808080;">(eg. add more trips during peak hours, reduce trips during periods with lower demand, having short trips [I believe the bus company is allowed to do this], etc.)</span>, and other aspects of the bus operations, such as bus advertising and finding ways to lower expenses through out-sourcing.</p>

              <p><strong>Joint News Release - Improvements to 25 Bus Services in First Quarter 2014:</strong></p>
              <p> <strong style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px;"><em style="margin: 0px;">Joint News Release by the Land Transport Authority, SBST &amp; SMRT - </em></strong><strong style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px;"><em style="margin: 0px;">Improvements to 25 Bus Services in First Quarter 2014</em></strong></p>
              <p><strong style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px;"><em style="margin: 0px;"></em></strong><strong style="color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><br>Less Crowding, Shorter Waiting Times and Better Connectivity</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: #333333; line-height: 18px; text-align: justify;">1.        By end March 2014, a total of 339 of the 550 Government-funded buses under the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) have been deployed to improve 125 existing bus services and introduce 18 new bus services. This has helped reduce crowding, improved bus frequencies and provided better connectivity for commuters. Peak hour loading has improved, and scheduled intervals have decreased by about 1 to 5 minutes on average.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px;">Better connectivity with new bus services</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">2.        In addition to the 18 new bus services operated by the public transport operators (PTOs), seven City Direct Services (CDS) were added to the bus network by tapping on the resources of private bus operators.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">3.        From today, Peak Period Short Service (PPSS) 912P will begin operation to serve residents in Woodlands during weekday peak periods. Starting from Woodlands Regional Interchange, the service will overlay on existing Bus Service 912 and ply Woodlands Avenue 5, Woodlands Avenue 2, Woodlands Avenue 1 and loop at Woodlands Street 41 before going back to the bus interchange.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">4.        Another three PPSS will be introduced in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, and Boon Lay in April and May 2014 respectively. Besides, one bus route will also be extended in the second quarter of 2014 to enhance connectivity for residents in Kallang. More information will be provided closer to the implementation date.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px;">Improved bus services</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">5.        To reduce crowding and waiting times, additional buses have been added to 25 bus services with heavy ridership during morning and evening peak hours in the first quarter of 2014. In all, 240 additional weekly peak hour bus trips have been added in the first quarter.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">6.        For example, SBS Transit Service 195 now runs more frequently at intervals of 8 to 12 minutes during morning peak period, from 10 to 13 minutes previously. Similarly, for evening peak period, the service now runs at 8 to 12 minute intervals instead of 8 to 15 minutes previously.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">7.        SMRT Service 972 now runs at 8 to 10 minute intervals during morning peak period, compared to the 11 to 12 minute intervals previously. It now runs at 10 to 12 minute intervals, instead of 13 to 15 minute intervals during evening peak period.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">8.        In addition, as part of the on-going quarterly bus service review process, the PTOs have also improved 20 bus services by deploying higher capacity buses and/or adding more bus trips along sectors that experience heavy ridership to better match demand along these sectors. In total, the operators have added 135 weekly trips during peak hours for these 20 services.<br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;"><strong style="margin: 0px;">Expanded BSEP</strong><br style="margin: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px;">9.        As announced by the Minister for Transport during the 2014 Committee of Supply debate, the Government will expand the BSEP and introduce another 450 buses from 2015 to 2017, with the bulk of the improvements to be completed by end 2016. This will bring the total number of Government-funded buses to 1,000. Together with the buses injected by the PTOs, as well as the CDS and PPSS operated by private bus operators, this will increase Singapore’s total bus fleet available for public bus services by 35%. The expanded BSEP will provide more resources to double the number of new routes from 40 announced previously to 80, and allow LTA to improve frequencies of feeder services as the next priority focus for the BSEP.</p>

              existing stretches of feeder bus services 222, 240, 268, and 912.
              All four PPSS will operate at least five trips per hour during
              weekday morning and evening peak periods (except on public
              holidays) connecting commuters to nearby MRT stations and bus
              interchanges. PPSS will help reduce crowding, reduce commuter
              waiting times and will improve reliability during peak hours. The
              bus services will charge distance fares similar to current feeder
              services.</p>

              <p>After thoughts...<br> <br> sv11/141 could be merged for EoS to terminate at NS or become a
              loop service<br> <br> sv853 could be extended to UEC(which is currently doin on Sun/PH)
              for greater/added connectivity<br> <br> sv175,961,980,985 existing routes are long imo...<br> <br> Guys forgot sv64 at Sims Place... the lone ranger there OR<br> existing Lorong 1 Geylang services are progressively extended so as
              to phase out/redevelop the terminal for other use(in some master

              <p>Yes can make svcs terminate at NS... There is a coach stand there with proper boarding facilities and connection to Stadium MRT... There is even a room with windows that is apparently sealed up...</p>

              <p>Does the new service mean:</p>
              <p>1. Extension of existing service terminating at Lor 1</p>

              <p>Which is the Yutong ZK6107H. Nice coach actually, it is using a Cummins engine coupled to an auto ZF gearbox, really changed my views on MIC buses, it is actually quite smooth and comfortable.</p>

              <p>Looking forward to more PPSS services.</p>

              <p>Yutongs are not really bad actually. </p>
              <p>Had a good time riding ex-SMRT Yutong on BT svc 621. </p>
              <p>It is the only China brand I would say would be barely on par with some of the international bus manufacturers here. </p>

              <p>may as well take over the full route. i think it a matter of time when lta let pte operator take over a feeder service route. maybe let the pte operator take over smrt buses and run the service full time.</p>
