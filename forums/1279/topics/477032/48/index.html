              <p>Agree. If 659 goes that way, it will take a longer distance and

              <p>Hi mr 23ispolo, yes true that it goes a longer distance. However, the main objective is to bring those bedok residents at bedok south and north all at 1 time to CBD. Even by this longer route, the journey time will still be 15 to 20 min lesser than bus + MRT. Cheers </p>

              <p>I really beg to differ with your point. Can you post your loading observation? I have seen AM peak Citaros with standees towards Lakeside. PM peak also I see around 20-25 pax boarding at Lakeside towards TJ Terminal. Maybe does not need DDs yet, but the service is doing much better than 116 launched 18 months back and 120 also.</p>

              <p><br>I will observe the service again but when I had taken it after one month of launch.</p>
              <p>AM peak - very poor loading upto st 42. Loading started picking up at st 42 and when it came to st 41 already had standees. This was a Citaro. Lakeside MRT - only 12-15 pax on bus with 5-6 pax boarding at that stop.</p>
              <p>After that also I have seen in peak sv 49 does have good loading in AM towards Lakeside and PM from Lakeside to Taman Jurong.</p>
              <p>334 loading still remains very high. The last KUB should also be converted to DD slot.</p>

              frankly wouldn't be bothered about this extra svc (in terms of
              profibility) too. </p>
              <p>Try taking 621. It's great, and it's by Bedok Transport. Proper
              step-free city bus with accurate arrival times and great
              reliability. </p>
              <p>To make a long story short, pte companies can turn great, if
              they are given a chance. Call "P", citydirect svcs chances? Fuck
              lah. More of pity given under uncertainty and insecurity ba. Like
              asking a dog to "act human" by asking it to merely pick up
              newspaper from your doorstep. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, you miss the gist of the issue. Purpose is transport from mrt to hougang ave 9/4 during the evening peak timing. I have to stress the direction is from mrt towards hougang. Not the other way round. So your first statement is already invalidated. Why from serangoon and not buangkok? Of course the answer should be obvious. Serangoon crowd to hougang is much more than buangkok. Serangoon is circle line and north-east line. So people from circle line are also considered. Cheers</p>

              <p><br>You might be right that Buangkok is closer to Hougang Ave 4, but also the truth is a lot of people take 109 from Serangoon after alighting from CCL and NEL to Hougang Ave 4/9. I have taken a WEG 6+pm from Serangoon Interchange and while it left interchange with 50-55 pax, along Boundary Rd and YCK Link, it picked up pax that made more than 90 pax. And I was surprised to see 60-70 pax alighted on stops along HG Ave 9 and HG Ave 4. When the bus came to Buangkok Green, it was left with barely 30-35 pax, some of whom who boarded along HG Ave 9/4.</p>
              <p>So for me this SWT makes sense, else SBST would have to introduce more DDs during that time from Serangoon to Changi (which could be waste of resources since beyond Buangkok loading is very low in PM).</p>
