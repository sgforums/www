              even 2 axles ones…Wonder why <span>SBST</span> and
              <span>SMRT</span> order so many SDs in the first
              place?SBST should have at least 70% DDs in its fleet..Now almost

              <p>Singapore is nowhere far from the situation. Look at the lasting consequences of having 3-car trains running at 4-7 mins freq on the CCL, causing catastrophic crush loads during peak where people along Paya Lebar - Serangoon and Buona Vista - Bishan could not board. Buses come and travel at a duration that felt like ages. Hope the new CCL trains would help (even during off peak)</p>

              <p>Rail only. Besides time, I dont care about anything

              <p>Singapore is nowhere far from the situation. Look at the lasting
              consequences of having 3-car trains running at 4-7 mins freq on the
              CCL, causing catastrophic crush loads during peak where people
              along Paya Lebar - Serangoon and Buona Vista - Bishan could not
              board. Buses come and travel at a duration that felt like ages.
              Hope the new CCL trains would help (even during off peak)</p>

              <p>If you are in direction of Higashi-Shinjuku just walk there and take the Fukutoshin line and you will be in Ikebukuro in 15 mins total.</p>
