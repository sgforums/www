All four PPSS will operate at least five trips per hour during weekday morning and evening peak periods (except on public holidays) connecting commuters to nearby MRT stations and bus interchanges. PPSS will help reduce crowding, reduce commuter waiting times and will improve reliability during peak hours. The bus services will charge distance fares similar to current feeder services.</p>

              <p>Actually they should look for operators having some city buses, not coach buses. One example would be like the Advanced Coach. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I think city buses would be easier for passengers to get up and down compared to coach buses.</span></p>
              <p>Whereas for express service, coach bus would still be okay. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I feel that SBS
                  Transit is now more of a bus operator, instead of the company it
                  seemed to be previously. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SBS Transit now only focus on bus service, on
                  how to operate them and how to improve
                  them. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">All the
                  campaigns and so on are now done by LTA and the
                  government.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If anyone notices, SBS Transit now hardly (or
                  never really) introduce its own company campaign (eg. <a title="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/press/2007-03-31-02-S.aspx</a>)
                  like in the past. Ever since the Government intervened, SBS
                  Transit's quality of bus services has
                  improved. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For
                  instance, the waiting time for buses and crowding level of buses
                  are now, to some extent, reduced. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>Personally, I feel that SMRT is gradually returning back to its
                  former self - during the Singapore MRT Ltd days &amp; during the
                  Trans-Island Buses days. In other words, the quality in all aspects
                  of SMRT has improved and is improving further. In terms of
                  technology, SMRT will soon catch up with SBS Transit, as it is
                  currently implementing all the technology that SBS Transit
                  implemented before the government intervened. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">When SMRT's first batch of Double Decker
                  buses enters service by 2016, along with the technology that would
                  all implemented by then, I am sure SMRT will be on par with SBS
                  Transit. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>
              <p>As the government introduces more bus services in SMRT areas via
                  the BSEP, I guess this would increase SMRT's share in the public
                  bus services industry and reduce SBS Transit's share, such that
                  both shares will eventually equalise at 50%-50%. This will cease
                  SBS Transit's monoploy status. Along with SMRT catching up in
                  technology and having Double Decker buses in its fleet,
                  t<span style="line-height: 1.231;">here is finally going to be real
                  competition between the two Public Transport
                  Operators! </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Thereafter, when everything is equal (except number of services
                  and buses) in both Public Bus Operators, I guess the Government
                  will say that whatever SBS Transit and SMRT have in common (by that
                  time) is the standard that a Public Transport Operator must
                  have.</p>
              <p>When the standard (eg. must have a prescribed list of
                  technology, must have at least how much proportion of Double Decker
                  buses, etc.) is set, I guess the Government will then open up the
                  Public Bus Industry and invite other bus operators to become Public
                  Bus Operator in Singapore.</p>
              <p>So... to some extent, the government is helping SMRT improve and
                  be on par with SBS Transit, while it pause SBS Transit's
                  improvement (in non-services areas). Personally, in my opinion, I
                  feel that it is only because the government intervenes that's why
                  SMRT implements the tracking system in its buses, introduces Double
                  Decker buses, etc.  Somehow, I feel that SMRT is right now
                  being SBSTransit-nalised (becoming similar to SBS Transit).
                  Eventually, SMRT will be so identical to SBS Transit that the only
                  difference is just in the logo, livery, colours schemes (in buses)
                  and the uniform that the staff wears. </p>
              <p>By then, when things become so identical, LTA will most likely
                  say that this is the standard that Public Bus Operators must have,
                  in order for them to get their license to operate public bus
                  services, or have their license renewed thereafter.</p>
              <p>By then, there will be many depots (right now, I think there is
                  only the one at Bulim) and interchanges (I think the one at Joo
                  Koon is developed and owned by LTA) built by LTA and leased to
                  Public Bus Operators. Whereas for the ones owned by the respective
                  Public Bus Operators, LTA will probably take over them and be the
                  new owner of them, then lease them to Public Bus
                  Operators. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">By then, I doubt any Public Bus
                  Operator would have the luxury of leasing an entire bus
                  depot/interchange. Most likely one bus depot/interchange will be
                  used by several Public Bus Operators, and every Public Bus Operator
                  can only lease parking lots, based on how many bus routes it
                  operates from the facility. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Meanwhile, there will surely be
                  excess buses that would not have space in the depot/interchanges,
                  if LTA takes over them and lease them to several operators. I guess
                  the government will either make it compulsory for every Public Bus
                  Operator to come up with their own money to buy land to build their
                  own parking space to park their buses, or (since land is scarce)
                  LTA will itself build one multi-storey storage building at every of
                  the four districts (north, south, east, west) of Singapore for
                  storing of buses, and make it compulsory for every Public Bus
                  Operator to rent the bus storage spaces at the buildings - the
                  proportion of storage space allocated in every storage building
                  would be based on the proportion of the PTO share in bus services
                  in the district the building is in. Somehow, I think many people
                  will complain and criticize if government chooses to do the second
                  option, because many people will say that the government waste
                  money build the multi-storey bus storage buildings - unless the
                  government can justify that the rent it forced out of PTOs actually
                  can make profits after a certain number of years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just in case suddenly no buses are
                  deployed, the government would probably make it a must that the bus
                  storage buildings/spaces in total must have the provision of
                  accommodating a certain number of Public Bus
                  Operators. </span></p>
              <p>By then, when the two Public Bus Operators become so identical,
                  all the infrastructure required for public bus services is owned by
                  the government, and all the provision of bus storage infrastructure
                  required are there, I guess the government will then open up the
                  Public Bus Services Industry and invite the Private bus operators
                  to become Public Bus Operators, and Public Bus Operators from other
                  countries to come to Singapore and be Public Bus Operators
                  here.</p>
              <p>By then, there will be a great competition among the Public Bus
                  Operators in the Public Bus Services industry. The government will
                  set the standards and regulate/control the industry, while the
                  Public Bus Operators compete among themselves to remain in
                  competition and avoid being replaced by other Public Bus Operators.
                  In other words, by then, the Public Bus Services industry will be
                  based on Contracts model. </p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 6px;">We’ve just awarded a contract to ST Electronics (Info-Comm Systems) Pte Ltd (STE) / Trapeze Switzerland GMBH Consortium to develop an Intelligent Bus Management System to integrate operations control, fleet management, passenger information and business management.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;">How does this system benefit our commuters? This new technology will enable SBS Transit and SMRT to better optimise their bus fleets and resources, which translates to better bus services. Commuters will not only<span class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;">enjoy more reliable bus services, but also more accurate information like bus arrival timings. You can better plan your journeys!</span></p>
              <div class="text_exposed_show" style="display: inline;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 6px;">The Intelligent Bus Management System is a step-up from the separate bus fleet management systems which SBS Transit and SMRT currently uses to manage their daily bus operations and to provide bus arrival information to commuters. The system will be implemented progressively from the end of 2015.</p>

                                      GMBH Consortium to develop an Intelligent Bus Management System to

                                      which SBS Transit and SMRT currently uses to manage their daily bus
                                      operations and to provide bus arrival information to commuters. The

              <p>Previously, in my long "essay", I mentioned a <em>possible</em> problem of having a surplus of buses, that there may have to be parking space built to park extra buses.

              <ul>
              <li>There is a high possibility that LTA may takeover the ownership of the buses SBS Transit and SMRT have.</li>
              <li>It is quite likely that the public buses may all be re-painted with a common LTA livery.</li>
              <li>It is quite likely that LTA may own everything, while the Public Transport Operators would bid to operate services and use the LTA resources to operate them.</li>

              <div>Since the government has been working on implementing the Bus Contracts Model for many years now, why did it not take ownership of the new buses procured by the operators and give the new buses a common LTA livery? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"> </div>

              <div>Unless, the buses will not be in a common livery, and there will actually indeed be a surplus of buses as a result of contracts model - like the bad dream I had. Sigh. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If possible, I really wish that the buses could be in a common livery, so that at least there would not be a surplus of buses, which could actually mean a wastage of resources - since they are not employed. Although re-painting the buses to a common livery might be quite costly, the costs would still be lower - possibly much lower - than having so many many units of buses and having surplus of buses. So even if it may be a waste of money, I do not mind the buses being re-painted to a common livery because it is still cheaper than buying so many buses and having so many of them under-utilized. </div>

              <div>Besides, Singapore is a land-scarce country. It is really not feasible for us to have so many bus parks like how it is done in other countries that also uses the bus contracts model. #justsaying</div>

                                                          which could actually mean a wastage of resources - since they are
                                                          not employed. Although re-painting the buses to a common livery
                                                          might be quite costly, the costs would still be lower - possibly
                                                          much lower - than having so many many units of buses and having
                                                          surplus of buses. So even if it may be a waste of money, I do not
