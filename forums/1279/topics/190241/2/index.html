            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Concessionary fares and aircon buses</strong><br><br>From Kathryn Lau (Transitlink) and Tammy Tan (ComfortDelGro)<br><br>TODAY Thursday 18/05/06 Page 25<br><br>We refer to the letters, "Aren't firms subsidised for fare concessions?" and "Why same answer on poly fares?" (May 11).<br><br>Travel concession scheme is a privilege granted by the public transport operators and administrated by Transitlink. The student concession privileges are granted based on the level of academic pursuit and insitutions of enrolment. It is implemented on the objective of helping eligible students defray the cost of daily travel to and from school.<br><br>Under the new fare structure since 1 July 2005, adult fares has been adjusted. After review, the public transport operators however decided not to apply any increase to children and student fares, as well as prices for monthly concession passes.<br><br>All concessionary fares in Singapore are effectively cross - subsidised by full fare paying commuters. If further discounts were to be given to Polytechnic students, commuters who pay full fare may be adversely affected. Information on travel concession is available at Transitlink website, www.transitlink.com.sg<br><br>We also refer to Mr Damon Tan's feedback on Service 151. Previously, the authority put a cap on the number of air - conditioned buses so as to give commuters a choice between taking air - conditioned or non air - conditioned buses. Hence, we ended up buying non - airconditioned buses as well. The cap on the number of air - conditioned buses has since been lifted and SBS Transit has committed to having a fully air - conditioned bus fleet.<br><br>But we must be prudent in the pace we replace the non air - conditioned buses. All non air - conditioned buses that are in good serviceable condition will continue to be deployed and will be replaced when they reach their statutory lives.<br><br>As it is, over 90 per cent of SBS Transit's buses are already equipped with air - conditioning and the number of non air - conditioned buses has been declining from 282 buses in 2003 to 249 buses in 2004. This has been further reduced to 244 buses now.<br><br>The buses will be replaed eventually. - TODAY</div>
