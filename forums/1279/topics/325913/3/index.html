              <p>But all ELBOs i took recently chiong leh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The
              fastest was on 178, when it sped at around 70-80km/h at kranji.
              Driven by china SL. I can say when ELBOs chiong, its more shiok
              than a merc. At least its quieter than a merc. Merc's hub reductor
              axle sound can be quite annoying sometimes.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I like ELBOs for these reasons :</p>
              <p>Very steady acceleration. Got a very powerful engine.</p>
              <p>Somehow its very quiet when chionging on expressways/ smooth
              roads, altho when going over bumps its another story. That time i
              took it on 966 when going to work at around 6am+. Anyone who is
              sitting down is sound asleep. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><br> Its braking is very smooth as well. Try taking TIB839E. Its really
              smooth.</p>

              <p>usually ELBOs are for free massage, and at times, free sauna. Scania suspension worse than that of merc. take a merc and scania on 961 and compare the difference when travelling towards Geylang Lor 1, along Woodlands Rd</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Well, Dennis Lance and Hino Suspension is similar. It was too hard. When, it goes through a bump. You can feel how hard it is. Anyway, why Dennis Lance sometimes loves to give out air, i thought that was turbo lag at one moment but seems to come from some air tank or something.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>for 'manjieass' pic of 1255, I wonder how the mechanics can remove the aircon till I can see the hole on the roof. It was really weird. What if the UD have no roof aircon?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Softest suspension is ofcourse the MBO405. The suspension is soft but sometimes, I can feel the body making contact with the wheels when I sit on the seat above the wheel well. Volvo B10M MK-IV is ok but when one person board the bus, how come the suspension can be soft till I can feel the bus move when I'm sitting at the back. Example is SBS2696E.</p>

              <p>Perhaps you can take the SMRT bus models with undercarriage aircon as reference.<br><br>Anything with a way in will have a way out, even if it means dismantling the whole roof. Engineers and designers are not there for nothing.</p>

              <p>Same, the lances has really horrible suspension, although there's a few exceptions e.g tib939 which has slightly better suspension. Although Nissans has leaf springs, the soft seats compensates for hard suspension. smrt's o405 has good suspensions, but i would prefer the b10ble. It feels so comfy when it passes through the slope on Jurong town hall rd.</p>
              <p>Anyway, back on topic. Will surely miss the nissans, although i dislike to take it during peak hours on 852, its a total different experience during non peak hours where the driver seldom stop to drop off or pick up passengers.</p>

              <p><br>I think the UD is the best in terms of engine noise. But must say again that the sounds coming from other components like suspension or others made it not the most quitest bus around. The most quitest one i think is SBS8030L but in SMRT, I think the Hinos and the Lance stood a good chance, along with the DAF and Scania.</p>

              <p>Especially along Sembawang Road with alot of bumps. But generally speaking, older English buses seems to have stiff suspension... Think LOs and Dennis Tridents.</p>

              <p>for 'manjieass' pic of 1255, I wonder how the mechanics can
              remove the aircon till I can see the hole on the roof. It was
              really weird. What if the UD have no roof aircon?</p>

              <p>Well, Dennis Lance and Hino Suspension is similar. It was too
              hard. When, it goes through a bump. You can feel how hard it is.
              Anyway, why Dennis Lance sometimes loves to give out air, i thought
              that was turbo lag at one moment but seems to come from some air
              tank or something.</p>

              <p>Its from teh air compressor. Altho some Lances have funny sounds like what you had mentioned, particularly is TIB1013P and TIB1008E. FYI, turbo lag doesn't give out air sounds. Listen to the LO3x, which has the most obvious turbo lag problem. Listen how slow the turbo comes on (it has a shrilling sound). Otherwise you can take TIB844P and listen to its turbo system .TIB844P got turbo silencer problem, a some sort of valve or smth (cant rmbr its proper name) is broken/missing.</p>
