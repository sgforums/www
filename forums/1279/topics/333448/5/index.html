              <p>Nice thread. Im really curious what interest the other bus fans besides bus spottings. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Heres some of my interest :</p>
              <p>Drive my "bus". LOL. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> No lah just kidding. I like to cycle around on my bike. Occasionally cycle from my house at Bukit Panjang to areas like Ang Mo Kio (bike service centre at AMK) and offroad stuffs like Bukit Timah hill. Sometimes also ride to city area overnight.</p>
              <p>Photography. I enjoy taking photos most of the time, majority of which are Urban pictures.</p>
              <p>Spot machineries such as cranes as well as look out for demolition site. I like to spot construction and demolition machines.</p>
              <p>Travel around. I enjoy travelling, be it within singapore, or outside Singapore like going on a tour.</p>
              <p>Going on a feast. I like to eat alot, unfortunately, i dont have the budget yet. I enjoy eating local foods as well as fast food like Subway and Pepper Lunch.</p>
              <p>Collect construction machinery models. I have a few of them at home.</p>
              <p>Well, these are some of my interests. Hope to hear from the others soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>Yes, everyone isn't perfect. Well, as for his case, shall see how much he is able to change then. We shall wait and see...</p>
              <p>I don't want to see him showing off whatever he has. Yes, I know, everyone will show off but as long as he never get overboard can already. A piece of sv53 rear desto isn't interesting at all, it's just a piece of plastic with numbers, can't he just put it in somewhere properly or just take a photo of it then show photo will do. Some might flame back "Wah, you jealous ah?!", no, no jealousy here. Showing off...well, sharing, doesn't mean that you have to ensure the <strong>whole world </strong>to know.</p>
              <p>Talking loudly on the phone or with someone else, this is what a lot of people had been complaining and was said many times but he still does that. We dont' have to know what he is talking about. Someone has to tone him down then he'll talk softly. Well, I shall forget about seeing him improving on this point. <em><span style="color: #ffffff;">(Basically, no initiative)</span></em></p>
              <p>Walking up and down on the bus (as in from front to rear, rear to front). As for this, he better stop it, he is just creating awareness that "Oh, he is on the bus" just to see something, kind of weird behaviour on the bus, you wouldn't see anyone else doing that.</p>
              <p>What I've already said many times, stalking, spying and all that. He must refrain from doing all these, he doesn't need to know everything and follow everywhere the person is going to.</p>
              <p>Overall, he had been pissing many of us off here.</p>
              <p>Why do I post all these here? <strong>It's for HIS own good.<br></strong>Why do I say that? As for showing off desto, what might happen to cause you in trouble? Think for yourself. Walking up and down, what if he trips and falls? He'll be injuried and disrupt bus operations. As for the others, if he is to change, it'll then improve his personal image, not like now, what a bad image.</p>
              <p>I shall end off my comments about Afiq here. Nenepokey and Roderick, help your good friend too.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>As for my other interests:<br>I like to listen to songs, play PC Games (Especially Strategy, Driving and Simulation games)<br>I'm interested in computers<br>Favourite radio station: 987FM <em>(Muttons to Midnight)</em> and Yes 93.3fm.</p>

              <p>Oh ya following what some of you guys have said time for me to add on to what else i do:</p>
              <p>Hunt for good food in Singapore. you can say i have basically covered most hawker centres in the east and central areas with good food. In addition I have visited all hong kong cafes (those with chain outlets) as well.</p>
              <p>Bus ride food hunt is something i dont mind provided if I can stomach it.. haha..</p>
              <p>Radio Stations..</p>
              <p>Class 95 The Morning Express (Glenn and FD are good!) / Love Songs with Yas is my choice for weekdays.<br>Weekends dont get me the Y2K weekend &amp; techno songs will do. The other themed weekend songs are ok with me.</p>
              <p>Next alternative is Gold 90 and i switch to there if Class 95 doesnt seem to be my cup of tea at that time.</p>

              <p>Oh ya following what some of you guys have said time for me to add on to what else i do:</p>
              <p>Hunt for good food in Singapore. you can say i have basically covered most hawker centres in the east and central areas with good food. In addition I have visited all hong kong cafes (those with chain outlets) as well.</p>
              <p>Bus ride food hunt is something i dont mind provided if I can stomach it.. haha..</p>
              <p>Radio Stations..</p>
              <p>Class 95 The Morning Express (Glenn and FD are good!) / Love Songs with Yas is my choice for weekdays.<br>Weekends dont get me the Y2K weekend &amp; techno songs will do. The other themed weekend songs are ok with me.</p>
              <p>Next alternative is Gold 90 and i switch to there if Class 95 doesnt seem to be my cup of tea at that time.</p>

              <p>Drive my "bus". LOL. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> No lah just kidding. I like to cycle around on my bike. Occasionally cycle from my house at Bukit Panjang to areas like Ang Mo Kio (bike service centre at AMK) and offroad stuffs like Bukit Timah hill. Sometimes also ride to city area overnight.</p>
              <p>Photography. I enjoy taking photos most of the time, majority of which are Urban pictures.</p>
              <p>Spot machineries such as cranes as well as look out for demolition site. I like to spot construction and demolition machines.</p>
              <p>Travel around. I enjoy travelling, be it within singapore, or outside Singapore like going on a tour.</p>
              <p>Going on a feast. I like to eat alot, unfortunately, i dont have the budget yet. I enjoy eating local foods as well as fast food like Subway and Pepper Lunch.</p>
              <p>Collect construction machinery models. I have a few of them at home.</p>
              <p>Well, these are some of my interests. Hope to hear from the others soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Golden Mile's KHENG FATT BEEF NOODLES,  BUGIS STREET BEEF NOODLES, SINGAPORE RIVER BEEF KWAY TEOW. all serve nice ones.</p>
              <p>lor 7 tpy market's HAINAN XINGZHOU BEEF NOODLE still best. the main branch for franchise HWA HENG BEEF NOODLES also not bad at amk hub 3rd level foodcourt. block 233 amk ave 3 one standard dropped. MR WONG SEREMBAN BEEF NOODLES at block 85 near parkway parade also not bad, different style. the TEOCHEW BEEF NOODLE store at whampoa also not bad. $3 generous portions. another TEOCHEW BEEF NOODLE store at telok ayer street also worth the try. HOCK LAM BEEF NOODLES at upp sgoon road or far east square is probably one of the more pricey but pretty worthwhile place to visit. CHANGI VILLAGE BEEF KWAY TEOW is one of the better ones located at changi village terminal food ctr. the HOCK LAM BEEF NOODLE at purvis st is owned by a brother and is not part of the main chain priced steeply but i enjoy it each time i visit. NEW KATONG BEEF NOODLES located beside 328 KATONG LAKSA along east coast road is one of my favourites, it used to be under the ODEAN chain. theres one at CENTURY SQ food court at level 3 and that one is nice too. NGAK SEAH ST BEEF NOODLE at lavender food sq at jalan besar has a very simple but authentic beef broth that makes you wanna go back for more. the hakka version at SYED ALWI ROAD is different but their springy handmade beefballs are what makes them famous. the one at CHINA SQUARE CENTRAL BASEMENT is so-so. the CHINATOWN FOOD CENTRE one must order soup version. the CHANGI AIRPORT T1 basement canteen is not nice. the TELOK AYER ST CUPPAGE BEEF NOODLE to me lacked flavour. not a fan of the LOR 9 GEYLANG BEEF KWAY TEOW, looked like beef hor fun. the EMPRESS BEEF NOODLES also used to be part of HOCK LAM serves very traditional broth but not my cup of tea overall. the one at HOUGANG ST 21 BLOCK 203 WONG POH KOPITIAM's owner moved out and taken over by china nationals, standard has dropped drastically. the one at PLAZA SING or PS KOPITIAM AT LEVEL 6 XIN DAI BEEF is more of the TAIWANESE CUM SINGAPORE HAINAN STYLE that one also not bad</p>
              <p>sorry if this alittle offtopic</p>
              <p>lol this can go food forum le. any other beef noodle lovers? i dun really have interest in BEEF BRISKET HK STYLE NOODLES.</p>
