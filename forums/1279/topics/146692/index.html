            <div class='col-md body'>One of the reasons why SBST sticks to Volvo and SMRT sticks to mercedes is because they get special prices for the buses. As you can see they have been operating the type for quite a number of years and they are experience in maintaining the buses. The less bus types , the easier and cheaper maintainance is . Unless the prices of the new Korean buses are cheaper , I can't see them buying any of their products . SBST and SMRT , I am pretty sure they are trying to min the bus type .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe Japanese and Korean buses may be slightly cheaper. However, SBS and Tibs have exclusive deals with Volvo and Merc respectively, so these 2 makes will remain predominant.<br><br>A side note, there are some KIA minibuses in private service in Singapore. Daewoos have also been deployed as tour coaches, but those are MY-registered.</div>

The citybus model is the BH115, mostly from the now defunct NAEILA of which few remained today. The coaches are the Daewoo Royale and they were the first bus type used for the Transnasional Executive Coach. Outside of Malaysia, Bangkok has a fair number of Daewoo BH115 as well on services provided by the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority. I guess the demise of Daewoo ended all that.</div>
