At first, they wore light brown jackets. Then, they wore light brown shirts with the words "Trans Island" written all over. After that, then they wore the yellow floral shirts we see today. The trousers have always been dark brown.<br><br>SBS's uniform was unchanged for over 20 years! The drivers wore pale blue jackets and dark blue pants. Only in 2000 did they swictch to the uniforms we see today.<br><br>Anyone remember what the CSS drivers wore?</div></blockquote>I think SBST had their uniform changed before. I remembered seeing once in the NDP clip the uniform was grey with a small red old SBS logo above the pocket. It's rather thick too.</div>

The pale blue uniform does look grey at times - the same way the current pale green shirt looks like a shade of blue depending on the lighting.</div>
