Lets just face the fact.<br><br>With regards to whether which bus company provides a better frequency, we all know..<br><br>p.s. you waited 1Hr + for 107 ? Did you check the route details for Svc 107 ? They do have different routings at different timings.. got a feeling tat you wanted for that service at the wrong place at the wrong time.</div>
