              <p>hi all<br><br>I was privillaged enough to visit Soon lee depot recently. At the lobby , i found old pix of Jurong bus park. this inspired my past memeories trip back in time for this post.<br><br>JURONG BUS PARK. <br>Before Soon lee bus park, there was a Jurong bus depot. It was in charge of two bus park faciltiies. Jurong Bus depot and Penjuru Jurong bus park. Jurong Depot had full depot faciltiies and was situated next to the old Jurong bus interchange. for those who still remember where Jurong Bus Int and the depot was, will acknowledged that it must had been easy to deploy buses from the depot to the interchange since they were right next door to each other. note that a petrol stn that was probbabaly for buses to use still stands today but ebing used by Shell. <br><br>A smaller bus park was built at Penjuru rd. i do believe it was only a bus park n had no workshop and depot facilities. Service 143 used to terminate at this bus park. The terminus was referred to as teban gardens Bus terminal. I hope someone can clear up if the bus went into the depot or had a roadside bus terminus facilites in this Penjuru area. (surhirman..=).)</p>
              <p><br>Jurong Depot besides providing buses for the Jurong Ind services also had serve for fleets of bus  services calling at Clemtni int, kent ridege ter or Bouna Vista under its control. Presumbly, buses from the penjuru bus park (nearer to Clementi, kent ridge and Bouna Vista ter) were despacthed out.<br><br>documents (as in busway magazines in NUS lib) show that</p>
              <p>service 92 : Clementi - Paya lebar airport was operated by Jurong. Svc 146 with its LO2x yeah? JR confirmed. I've always wondered how 146 gets lo2x...ah hah.</p>
              <p>Service 33 (kent Ridge)  also JR.  Service 200 (kent ridge) also JR.&lt; For those who wish to know a further significance with regards to
                      today of this  fact may PM me, it is because of JRDEP operating the west
                      side services ard the NUS area that till today....certainly a glad
                      reminder of the past for myself &gt;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>note that 92 33 and 200 all got merc OF1417s hawke which most of us will gladly agree are JRDEp type buses. 176 Clemtni - World trade Centre were one of the first services to use the Merc OF1417 of JRDEP. also bus 78: Clementi - Queensway Circus (Queensway Shopping centre)) was the first service to use Merc OF1417s. i will make a guess. JRDEP . Always wonder why u used to see merc OF1417 on 209? JRDEP buses. proof? busway i saw 209 under JR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even bus 188 whcih runs from ulu pandan terminus then had JRDEp merc but were NZMB mercs.</p>
              <p>it is believed that 95 and 96 were even under JR in 2000.</p>
              <p>I would like to point out an interesting JRDEP residents. Bus Svc M1 Science park - Bouna Vista MRT in 2000. I think when the service became 92, it was still under JR. it is proven in busway that M1 was under JRDEP. Further proof comes in the form of the Dennis Darts on M1 having been put on service with bus 182 which u all know is a JRDEP service for sure.  for those who have seen the darts on 182, u may rest assure darts were once in JRDEP..hahah</p>
              <p>Eventually i guess the bus fleets got too big for JRDEP and penjuru bus park to handle. So came the need for mega big bus depot. this is Soon lee Depot of today.<br><br>but wait, there is more, where did jurong Depot come from then? it is beleived by the article writer that jurong Depot when new new was a merger of Alexandra bus Depot and Woodlands Bus depot. but i cant be sure. of course folks will recall that Alexandra Depot (probably remants of the Hock lee bus Depot then) and Woodlands bus depot are the true orginal SBS new new depots when SBS started operations as SBS 1978 pte ltd.<br><br>ZYX</p>
              <p>am i that old?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Errata: please read article with Penjuru bus park as (Penjuru) Jurong bus depot. and jurong bus Depot to be changed to Jurong bus park. hey one's memories do fade with time and so uh get forgetful and type mistakes. so its Jurong bus park next to bus int and Jurong bus Depot in teban gardens there.</p>

              <p>Indeed. in the mid eighties, they even had an extension of bus int excercise just to hold the many new svcs that keep being introduced then. berths were added on a second concourse. this was to relieve the crazy load of so many services calling at the berths on one concourse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i called the second concourse the new new part of  int. hahaha. big contrsuction work gg on then in the int.  it is with the second concourse added Jurong int feels rather big to me.</p>

              <p>Clementi bus services were partially JRBP and BBDEP if I am not wrong. I remember MBOF1413 Soon Chow buses being deployed on short haul routes like services 96, 99, 205, 282, 284, 285, 287, SS2. Services 105, 209, SS3 should be under BBDEP, it had Volvo B57 and occasional Albion Vikings. Service 99 also had LO2x too. For service 92 I am not so sure, it had MBOF1417 Hawke as well as Albion Vikings (could be from HGDEP??). Service 146 should be dual TP/JRBP, it had LO2x. The short haul routes eventually became under BBDEP somewhere in 1990, where Volvo B57 and Albion Vikings were deployed. Service 99 then had the LAs.</p>
              <p>Kent Ridge bus services were also under JRBP in the past. Services 33, 200, 201 had MBOF1413s too, subsequently replaced by MBOF1417 NZMB. Service 33 then had Volvo MK2 DMs (I suppose depot transfer??). Remembered service 201 was withdrawn and replaced by new service 151, it was dual HGDEP/JRBP. Somewhere in 1999, services 151 and 200 came under BBDEP too.</p>
              <p>I think Buona Vista bus services were never under JRBP, it was all the while under BBDEP if I am not wrong, only had Volvo B57 and Albion Vikings on those short haul services like 95, 191, 202.</p>

              <p>Indeed. in the mid eighties, they even had an extension of bus int excercise just to hold the many new svcs that keep being introduced then. berths were added on a second concourse. this was to relieve the crazy load of so many services calling at the berths on one concourse.</p>

              anyway wayback history on svc 57...
              
              in the 1980s..
              it was a changi Airport svc to commonwealth drive (roadside terminal)
              
              later in the late 80s..
              sv 57 was Bishan to Sin Ming Dr (loop)-- if i'm not wrong , certain route sectors of sv 57 is now part of feeder svc 410.
              
              now..
              Sv 57 plies from Bishan to Bt Merah

              <p>Clementi bus services were partially JRBP and BBDEP if I am not
              wrong. I remember MBOF1413 Soon Chow buses being deployed on short
              haul routes like services 96, 99, 205, 282, 284, 285, 287, SS2.
              Services 105, 209, SS3 should be under BBDEP, it had Volvo B57 and
              occasional Albion Vikings. Service 99 also had LO2x too. For
              service 92 I am not so sure, it had MBOF1417 Hawke as well as
              Albion Vikings (could be from HGDEP??). Service 146 should be dual
              TP/JRBP, it had LO2x. The short haul routes eventually became under
              BBDEP somewhere in 1990, where Volvo B57 and Albion Vikings were
              deployed. Service 99 then had the LAs.</p>
              <p>Kent Ridge bus services were also under JRBP in the past.
              Services 33, 200, 201 had MBOF1413s too, subsequently replaced by
              MBOF1417 NZMB. Service 33 then had Volvo MK2 DMs (I suppose depot
              transfer??). Remembered service 201 was withdrawn and replaced by
              new service 151, it was dual HGDEP/JRBP. Somewhere in
              1999, services 151 and 200 came under BBDEP too.</p>
              <p>I think Buona Vista bus services were never under JRBP, it was
              all the while under BBDEP if I am not wrong, only had Volvo B57 and
              Albion Vikings on those short haul services like 95, 191, 202.</p>
