            <div class='col-md body'>good question<br><br>according to bus management textbooks in NUS it is wise to adopt a on schedule way of operations.<br><br>this is because people go work got routine and follow timins to go work. if a bus arrive late, means they late for work. its pure human habit to take the same bus to sch or work every single day at that time.<br><br>u jjust hope sbst put cameo on that slot then u get to sit all kind of bus.<br><br>for me i always hang ard on sbs9345 off 197 to go sch lols.<br><br>also it is preferable to have headways of 5 and 10 mins. having headway of say 11 or 16 min is frustrating to ppl cuz 5 and 10 easier to adjust on watch , when heng heng ur bus stop the bus arrive on the 5th min dot on ur watches, people are happy at that stop uz they cna expect the bus on the hand on their watches. (assume use old fashion watch)<br><br>ZYX<br></div>

I waited 40mins for some bus service who had a driver taking MC, the first bus came after 25 minutes due to the "missing" bus who's driver took mc, and it was packed to the door.

Hmm, if that slot really left out, the previous bus will help by departing late, pulling the frequency by 2 to 3 mins by each bus. This will help to maintain the frequency of the service.</div>
