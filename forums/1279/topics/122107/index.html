Tomorrow he will be kana jia-luck jia-luck from me.<br>Number of passengers involve: 1 + me ( Manager433, rumoured to be staff of Ass-MRT by forumers here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  )<br><br>This AssMRT bus was travelling along the slip road behind the St Andrew Sch when this young man hit the bell indicating that he wants to alight at the next approaching bus stops which is a good 200 meters away. He gets off his seat and scan his Ezlink card on the exit reader....beep. Done.<br><br>Since he already pressed the bell, I am also alighting at the same bus stop as him. I sat on the seat while waiting for the bus to reach the bus stop.<br>Zooommmmmmmmmm the bus drove pass the bus stop without stopping.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  He  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  I also  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> every passengers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .<br><br>The bus finally stops at the traffic light ( junction of upp s'goon rd, bendermeer rd ). The young man walks up to the 'day dreaming driver' and confront him. ( Note: I was still trying to recover from my  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  so I was still sitting, paisei paisei ).<br><br>Guess wat? Guess? Guess? Guess? That driver saying something softly to the poor man and at the same time, keep pointing his hand towards the 'BUS STOPPING' green light. Or was it 'BUS NOT STOPPING'??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>I roughly can figure out wat the driver meant, that the man pressed the bell after the bus passes by that bus stop. What a joke! I can witnessed! The driver was day dreaming and forgotten to stops!<br><br>The young man 'lan lan' no choice walks back to the rear door. Bus then turn left and stops at the next stop outside the former SCDF HQ bus stop and he alighted. ( No need to guess lah, I am sitting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ) Too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Wat kind of service is SMRT trying to show to their customers?

Some of the buses that I have boarded really knows the route so well such that they even know which lane is often jammed. For example, yesterday I boarded bus 147 SBS 9236 D. The driver drives quite "fast" in my opinion and when the bus reaches Jalan Besar near the junction with Sungei Road, the driver drove the bus into the second lane and proceeded on to Bencoolen Street as the first lane there is often jammed. In my opinion, I feel that SBST drivers are rather slow drivers as compared to SMRT drivers because perhaps they are trying to be prudent.</div>
