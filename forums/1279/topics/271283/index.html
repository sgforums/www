            <div class='col-md body'>LTA Introduces Initiatives To Enhance Public Transport Travel<br><br>Mr Raymond Lim, Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, inspects the first integrated real-time bus arrival information panel and Key Bus Services Map<br><br>Commuters will soon be able to get real-time bus arrival information of both SBST and SMRT buses services at 30 bus stops. This will help commuters better manage waiting time and transfers, so that they can make more informed travel decisions.<br><br>2     The first Real-Time Bus Arrival Information panel was inspected by Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Raymond Lim, at the Delfi Orchard and Le Meridien shopping centre bus stops today. With information supplied by SBST and SMRT, LTA will begin a trial to offer bus arrival times on a real-time basis at 30 bus stops with a high volume of commuter traffic -- 20 along Orchard Road and 10 in the Ang Mo Kio and Yishun HDB towns.<br><br>3     Commuters will now have the convenience of knowing how long more their buses will take to arrive at these bus stops, as these will be progressively fitted with LED panels by end August 2007. The panels will display the bus services that call at a particular bus stop, the arrival times of the next and subsequent buses for each bus service, and a symbol to indicate whether the bus is wheelchair-accessible.<br><br>4     Another initiative unveiled today was the Key Bus Services Map, to help commuters in the Orchard Road vicinity better plan their bus journey. The maps will be installed at 36 bus stops around the Orchard Road area by end August 2007. Each map will provide pictorial information on key bus services calling at the bus stop and the routes they cover. It will also indicate the MRT stations along the routes and significant buildings and locales. These maps will be especially helpful to tourists as they can determine which buses serve the places of interests in the vicinity. Please refer to Annex B for the list of bus stops and a sample of the map.<br><br>5     "We are focusing on improving the travel experience of commuters. The provision of real-time bus arrival information and key bus services maps will help commuters to better plan their journeys and manage their waiting time. These form part of the broader slew of initiatives to improve public transport for the benefit of commuters," said Mr Raymond Lim, Minister for Transport and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br><br>6     The two initiatives are introduced on a six-month trial basis, so as to allow time to take in commuters' feedback. To ensure that these services meet the needs of commuters, members of the public are welcome to share their feedback and suggestions via LTA's hotline 1800-CALL LTA (1800-2255 582) or their discussion forum Talk2LTA (talk2lta.lta.gov.sg).<br><br>7     "We'd like to hear commuters' feedback to help us refine these initiatives, to make them even more useful and relevant. By working in partnership with commuters and other stakeholders, we can better achieve our aim of making public transport a choice mode for all," said BG (NS) Yam Ah Mee, LTA's Chief Executive.<br><br>ISNT THAT COOL?</div>

Supposedly they say bus interval is about 15 minutes, but it can be delayed by up to half an hour or one hour, (especially) during traffic jams. So with these bus panels, I think it will be... useful," said one commuter.<br><br>"Sometimes I'm not sure if I'll be late for school. So if I know the bus is taking too long, I can take a cab straight away and won't waste too much time," said another.<br><br>"But the thing is that - will they really come? If they say 5 minutes, will the bus really come? To me, it's the same - not much difference. I'm used to waiting already."<br><br>This is not the first time the LTA has tried out such a system.<br><br>In 2003, the LTA aborted a three-year-old venture with homegrown company Stratech for a bus commuter information system.<br><br>But Transport Minister Raymond Lim said things are different now.<br><br>He said: "The main difference is that technology has improved and cost has come down."<br><br>Mr Lim added that the authorities want feedback from commuters before they go any further.<br><br>Still, even if the scheme works well, it will not be going island-wide.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "Because it's not cost effective. There are 4,000 over bus stops. You might not want to put one in every single bus stop. You look at where are the major areas where there are high commuter traffic and you target them."<br><br>Also introduced on a pilot level are Key Bus Services Maps which will be installed at 36 key bus stops around Orchard Road by end-August.<br><br>Primarily meant to help tourists, they are pictorial representations of surrounding landmarks and how to get there using the nearest bus stops and MRT stations.<br><br>Commuters can send feedback via the LTA hotline 1800-2255582 or at the forum . - CNA/ch</div>
