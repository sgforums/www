              <p>Thanks very much for your encouraging words!</p>
              <p>My motivation to work in Singapore has ONE reason and ONE reason ONLY:</p>
              <p>I want to live in a tropical climate, the more tropical, the better!!</p>
              <p>So now I am torn apart:</p>
              <p>Should I try to get a job in Singapore with its perfect tropical climate or should I just stay in Germany where there's better pay (and living costs are lower) and also better working conditions (comfortable part-time position)?</p>
              <p>Rather than walking in for an interview, I would like to come across a recruitment fair and check everything out there.</p>
              <p>Thanks again, 'SBS 1000U', for your very helpful post, I appreciate that!</p>

              <p><br>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm not sure how long you will be staying here but I don't think there will be any recruitment fair for these few months.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I feel that if the motivation is because of the weather, then I feel that you should think thrice. Singapore is a very hot country and the average temperature has been and will continue to increase year after year. We are already feeling the heat amid of all the overcroading everywhere. Sometimes we wish we can go and live somewhere temperate. Our tropical climate isn't so perfect too. Just my personal opinion. </p>
              <p>Secondly, the basic wages of a BC is not as attractive as what you are getting in Germany, (pay is low but living expenses are very high). Moreover, the work schedule is very hectic; i.e, you need to be punctual for all your bus trips everyday or you will be penalised, need to work for long hours weekly, need to rush within the schedule within the high traffic volumes, high passengers volumes, countless traffic lights and constructions obstructions, and other problems. Unless you are comforatble with this, because the pace of life and work isn't the same as it is in Germany.</p>
              <p>If I am you, I would choose to continue to work as a BC in Germany, as working conditions are much better and you can earn a decent pay for a living. So I recommend you to take account into all these factors before you decide to embark a career as a BC here. Unless you are really passionate about being a BC here and the main reason to work here is about your passion, else I feel it is better to work in Germany for the same career.</p>
              <p>However, if you are really keen in working in an Asian country, maybe you can try Hong Kong. The BC market is bigger there and they have lots of modern buses over there. Not sure about the wages and the job environment there but maybe you can try to find out. Hope all these helps. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>i did just that cos i know if i had went to HGDEP for interview
              instead i might end up in SLDEP, ARBP,BBDEP side which is far from
              my current residence.</p>
              <p>All new BCs regardless of depot they went to for walk-in
              interview all go HGDEP for 3 month training? like tekong to SAF,
              HGDEP to sbs?</p>
              <p>Maybe you would like to share on how come you left sbs for

              <p>Dude dun think so much.Bus companies know what they're doing.If you reside at Hougang then West District will based you at Hougang Depot and they will slot you in whichever Interchange that are control by HGDEP.If Sengkang feeders got slot then forr the 1st week you're based there.2nd service usually last for a month and probably Punggol have slot for 83 duty then you will be based there for a month.For third service is usually range from 3-6 mths and usually its a trunk service.Maybe Serangoon need BCs for 100/105 you woulnt know and after that you're out for Standby.You have to learn many service as possible that are HGDEP controlled(Minus full DD service).In this half year if you maintain good record ie less MCs/Accident then your Route Manager will recommend you for DD training.After period of time as a standby you can apply for a service depending on vacancies.I left SBST cause need some fresh air.SMRT Buses offer 2 days off per 6 days werk.My first service is 811 for a week then 853 for a month before out for standby.Service i have learn is 61,67,167,169,171,811,851,852,853,854,855,859,961,965,969,980,NR1,NR6 &amp; NR7</p>

              <p>  Thanks, 'SBS 1000U', for your open words. Another thing to consider is that an Ang Moh BC will be under constant, special scrutiny by the locals; not sure if I'd be up to the job.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Well, you can still have a ride on our buses even you can't join as a BC here.</p>
              <p>But I bet buses in Germany are better than ours.</p>

              <p>Hi SBS 1000U,</p>
              <p>I'm in Malaysia now.</p>
              <p>Your question:</p>
              <p>Yes, I am driving these on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>They are rather easy to drive; but as with any bus with a steered rear axle you have to be VERY careful when making sharp turns - the rear swings out quite a bit and lots of minor accidents happen that way  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/shout.png" alt="shout.png"></p>
              <p>Plus, tall bus captains may find that the bus wasn't designed for them ...</p>
              <p>Otherwise, I like driving them; I will do so again in March.</p>
