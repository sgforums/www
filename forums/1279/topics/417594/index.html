              <p>u can choose to go for a walk-in interview if you don't receive your reply for quite some time, maybe say a week.</p>
              <p>secondly, there are 3 depots available for you to go to for walk-in interview, namely AMDEP, HGDEP n SLBP. the depot u go to will most likely determine which district you will be assigned to. your actual depot you are assigned to might depend on how the HR shuffles.</p>

              <p>But I've spoken to someone with some insight and he told me point-blank that there isn't a chance in hell that SBS will employ a European as BC (that's also what they told me when I contacted them via e-mail).</p>

              <p>Should I happen to come across a recruitment fair while exploring Singapore I will ask them whether or not it makes sense for me to apply.</p>
              <p>So, I'll just have to continue driving buses in Germany then. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Are there any Singapore BCs here that would like to meet a German collegue? I'm staying in Little India.</p>

              <p>Still, there's no harm trying for the position :) although you'd probably need to pick up mandarin first.</p>

              <p>But I've spoken to someone with some insight and he told me point-blank that there isn't a chance in hell that SBS will employ a European as BC (that's also what they told me when I contacted them via e-mail).</p>

              <p>Should I happen to come across a recruitment fair while exploring Singapore I will ask them whether or not it makes sense for me to apply.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should try the walk in interview first before concluding anything. Anyway a face to face talk with a recruiter will be able to help you more as you can directly convince them with your years of skills and experience and your interest to work with them as a BC in SBST.</p>
              <p>An email will be doubtful to their HR since in Singapore, hardly anyone will really believe that an European will come down and work in menial jobs like a bus captain. To any Singapore HR point of view, such email could be unconvincing. </p>
              <p>I think it is the best you go down and meet them and convince them your interest in applying the job.<br>If not, ask them what is the reason behind it, etc, employment laws, wages doesn't meet expectation or whatever reason. In this case, you can roughly know whether you should work in Singapore as a BC, in any company.</p>

              <p>I don't think SMRT will employ him as well, think there is an employment law for hiring BCs in public bus companies.</p>
              <p>Maybe he can try Hippo bus as a bus tour guide. Maybe there's a hihger chance. And to Chauffer: Our Hippo Bus is a city tour bus that bring tourists around Singapore City landscapes. And the fleet are mostly double deckers. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>If you can't be a BC for SBST, maybe you can try applying as a BC for Hippo Bus. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Thanks very much for your encouraging words!</p>
              <p>My motivation to work in Singapore has ONE reason and ONE reason ONLY:</p>
              <p>I want to live in a tropical climate, the more tropical, the better!!</p>
              <p>So now I am torn apart:</p>
              <p>Should I try to get a job in Singapore with its perfect tropical climate or should I just stay in Germany where there's better pay (and living costs are lower) and also better working conditions (comfortable part-time position)?</p>
              <p>Rather than walking in for an interview, I would like to come across a recruitment fair and check everything out there.</p>
              <p>Thanks again, 'SBS 1000U', for your very helpful post, I appreciate that!</p>

              <p>welcome to the amdep family... hahaha. technically the HR officer is right, as even though you may be an AMDEP crew, you will have a permanent interchange / service. the 3 months training is for you to obtain your class 4A driving license. they will try to post you to an interchange that is as close to your residence as possible. where are you staying now?</p>

              bus interchange(i thought it's depot?). No choice of which
              interchange u wanna work at, you take whatever interchange they
              give you.</span></li>
