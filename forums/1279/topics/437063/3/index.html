              In case most of the people don't know, Comfort Delgro is one of the largest land public transport company in the world. Think it is the second largest.
              Why would the govt and Singapore want to let go such a big piece of meat? Probably they want to increase the share price of the company in the long run.

              <p>"competition" might actually lead to worse results. especially if the competition is not perfect, it never will be in Singapore's case. the market is too small. but competing within the same modes of transport will lead to conflicts in (our) interest. the best solution is SMRT 100% rail, and SBST 100% bus. it is more efficient and there's still competition (think 95/96 fleet upgrade in lieu with KR Station opening).</p>
              <p>there isn't a "best" solution actually. just trade-offs.</p>

              I rather they leave the current situation untouched, which means no withdrawal of services, no passing over of services to another company, and all proposals (new, amendments, withdrawals) are from the bus companies based on their research on demand patterns and only subjected to LTA approval. 
              LTA side should delete the territory boundaries, improve bus infrastructures to make them faster and open up express bus sector.

              Moreover, it doesn't really mean the whole stretch of the guided bus way must be running parallel with the roads, sometimes they can avoid to avoid highly clustered traffic lights junctions.

              <p>SBST operating the Downtown line is excellent (in my humble opinion).</p>
              <p>Why? Through competition, it is likely to make SMRT innovate and improve their bus operations esp in Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah areas for fear of losing too many commuters to SBST Downtown line. Currently SMRT bus operations are seriously lacking, esp. service 67 on weekends, 12 to 30 min a rigid bus comes and eventually brunch up with a few behind.</p>
              <p>Conversely, I believe with SBST operating the DTL, less SMRT bus services will be cut/SMRT not willing to give up some bus routes that duplicate DTL.</p>
