Anyone knows of the existence of any &amp; where to buy &amp; price ?<br><br>Currently there's many such gaming software on cars mainly, covering rallies, street races etc. A few on trucks too so what about the buses &amp; coaches ??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So far, there is no such thing. The most that bus fans around the world (HK/US/UK/SG) depend on is Midtown Madness 2....dat is as close as it gets....the game has only the Routemaster and a Chicago citybus... but one can download other buses made by bus fans using a program called zmodeller...i dont noe how to use it...if i did, i would have designed our local buses....<br>Local buses available that i saw were the LO2x and the VOLVO B10m bendy both in the SBS livery.<br>The rest of the buses are the london, eastern europe buses and HK's NWFB, KMB, CMB, KCRC....most using the same model as singapore buses.</div>
