              good initiative that we care for the disabled..
              
              Hope our LTA be more flexible and not wait till a service is WAB certified before allowing them board the bus. If a WAB bus on a non-WAB certified route arrives, please be more flexible and allow them board the bus. And we put the responsibility on the passenger to take care of him/herself if they try to alight on a bus-stop that is not WAB friendly. And hence, all WAB buses will just display the handicapped logo in the front windscreen.

              <p>subsidy from govt wun it end up come from taxpayers? isn't it e same from fare payers? concessions somewhat you've to give up a certain amt of margin</p>
              <p>now the thing is, why not give some if e co is profitable?</p>
              <p>as for the unemployed, why should I subsidise them if there are courses around to upgrade their skills for another sector that might have opening? issue is of mentality</p>
              <p>over e students fare, it's flawed. tat 45c fare has remained for almost a decade yet it ended up w/ 1c deduction yet the poly - JC fare issue has been lingering for years especially now per cohort is 2 poly student vs 1 JC student ratio (60% poly, 30% JC or pre - Uni and 10% ITE).</p>

              <p>Before the WAB buses and retrofit of stations, the PIW cannot even take the train or bus. So there isn't that loss to begin in the first place.</p>
              <p>Even if they were already taking buses and trains long ago, Is the PIW population *that* large for SBST to lose so much in profitability, that they have to jack up the fares?</p>
              <p>Are we going to say that since PIWs take buses and trains now rather than taxis, taxi fares go up because of the loss in profit from PIW?</p>

              <p>The government (or CDCs) do hand out transport subsidies for some of these people. IMO, they aren't doing enough though.</p>
              <p>If they are proposing that PIWs travel for free, then the argument of mentality would hold a lot of water. Some PIWs have a proper job and go to work everyday. There is a reason why the operators are asking for reduction rather than total waiver.</p>
