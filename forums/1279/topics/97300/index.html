            <div class='col-md body'>A bit of elaborations on certain buses:<br><br>Volvo B10M MK II - Though old, it has huge amount of torque, and no speed limiter in them (somehow)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Volvo B10M MK III - Not all of them are that sluggish. Some can be really speedy. That really depends on who the driver is<br><br>Volvo B10M MK 4 DM, WA Strider - Same type of engine, good power, but screeching fan belt can cause people to pull off their hairs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Volvo B10M MK 4 DM 3500 - The most quiet type of B10M MK 4 so far. Good pickup and good speed. However the gearbox might not be suitable at all times<br><br>Leyland Olympian 3 Axle - Don't ever think that they are old and slow. In fact, they can be quite good speeders. Again, this depends on how the driver manipulates them.<br><br>Volvo Olympian 3 Axle - 92/93 series can speed, as they seem to be ligher in some manner. Some of them between 94-96 sries may be sluggish, but performance wise is kinda average.<br><br>Volvo Olympian 2 Axle - Lightweight, fast, and windy. If it's roof-less, it can be a convertible. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Scania N113CRB - Oh my god! Accleration can really win other models, just by the step on the accelerator. However, the gearbox can be jerky at times, creating rough rides in between journey.<br><br>Mercedes Benz O.405 - One of the primitive batch of Single Deck Air-Con Buses. Engine can be really powerful at times.<br><br>Dennis Trident - Out of the double deck range, this fella has better acceleration. Might be due to its horsepower.<br></div>

The speed depends on the speed limited at, which vary between each bus. Some can be 60 km/h, some can be 63 km/h while another can be at 65km/h.<br><br>The scheduling also plays a part in the "fastness" of the bus. A same bus can be fast to A, but slow to B due to scheduling. I personally witnessed this first hand. Citing the example you gave, 806T may be rushing for time while 2638Z is not (normally SBST 161 buses doesn't rush).</div>

I've taken a LO3X that went close to 70kmh in Singapore ( SBS 9026T, Sv 161 ) and which overtook <strong>TWO</strong> SMRT O405s. The only major problem with the LO3X is the steering but its performance makes up for it.</div>

I have sat his bus before and he has gone on the right lane of SLE in a heavy downpour so as to overtake a car in the middle lane.<br><br>I would just like to re-emphasise that no bus is naturally fast or slow. It really depends on the driver who is driving the bus. I have sat on a MkIII (svc 89) that overtook an SMRT O.405 on TPE and I have sat on a VO3X (9619H) that overtook a Trident on TPE and if that is not enough, I have sat on a LO3X that sped up the ramp to TPE and cut straight into the middle lane of TPE, overtaking 2 SMRT O.405s and a Mk4 DM3500.<br><br>So, my point of contention is that, a good driver with a bad schedule can coax the best of a bus. Another driver who has a good schedule will generally roll along so as not to catch up with the bus ahead of him. They have schedules to follow and they generally want to follow according to their schedules.</div>

The bus was packed and I was standing near the front door. I saw the bus meter clocked 80-90 km/hr (reach 90 at one point) while travelling on the outer lane on the TPE-CTE flyover and reach WDL in &lt;20 min. Is there no speed limit for this bus?</div>
