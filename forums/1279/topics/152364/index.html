It seemed to me a logical answer as to why this brand is so popular north of the Causeway. The only MAN trucks we have are the 5-tonners used by the army while it is not uncommon to find haulage trucks in Malaysia bearing the Lion badge. Also, the only known bus operator with a large number of MAN buses in its fleet is SJE (SBST has just one). Across the Causeway, Handal Indah and RapidKL are heavy users of MAN models.<br><br>I find MAN buses better to some extent than the Fuso ones. The latter can be rather horrible.</div>
