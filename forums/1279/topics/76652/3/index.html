I find that SBST16 is the most interesting route of the 5 routes that were diverted. Here's SBST16's diverted route. This would include at the bus stops called along the way.<br><br>Towards Marine Parade:<br>Bras Basah Rd - Raffles Hotel<br>Beach Rd - Raffles Hotel<br>Beach Rd - Opp Plaza Parkroyal<br>Jln Sultan - Opp Textile Ctr<br>Victoria St - Express<br>Kallang Rd - Express<br>Sims Ave - Express<br>Geylang Lor 1 - Express<br>Mountbatten Rd - Handicapped Voc Sch<br>Stadium Cres - KFC<br>After this bus stop at junction of Stadium Walk &amp; Cres, the bus stopped at the middle of the road and talk to a TI (Traffic Inspector). It seems like TI instructed the driver to turn right instead of going to Kallang Theatre to U-Turn. Or did TI told the driver to use New Stadium Drive and continue via normal route from Stadium Rd? Well as far as I know, this is the next bus stop that the driver called...<br>Stadium Walk - Express<br>Stadium Boulevard - Opp KFC<br>Old Airport Rd - bla bla bla..<br><br>Towards City:<br>Old Airport Rd - bla bla bla..<br>Stadium Cres - KFC<br>Stadium Walk - Opp CP F<br>Stadium Walk - Indoor Stadium<br>Stadium Rd - CP B<br>New Stadium Drive - Express<br>Stadium Boulevard - Express<br>Mountbatten Rd - Opp Handicapped Voc Sch<br><br>I alighted there.. not sure after that.<br><br>On my return trip in direction towards city, i saw a MRP 16 plied the following route after Stadium Cres:<br>Stadium Walk, New Stadium Drive, Stadium Rd, and continue via normal 16 route to MRP.<br><br>Note: The buses that I was on stopped at those bus stops because someone wants to alight while for Beach Rd stops.. boarding.<br><br>After this analysis, I concluded that the diverted buses does not allow boarding and alighting activites along Kallang Rd and Victoria St. Otherwise, it would further delay their trip time. It seems like drivers stop at bus stops with this sign displayed. Kallang Rd and Victoria St doesnt have it.<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Notice1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Notice1.JPG</a><br><br>Time: 1744 hrs at Mountbatten Rd stop. SBST11 arrived at the Handicapped Voc Sch bus stop where the ETA is 1740 hrs. It seems like SBST11 have practically no rest because of the greater distance covered..<br><br>Time: 1749 hrs at Geylang Rd/Geylang Lor 1 junction. SBST11 present at this junction, departed 3-4 min late i guess...<br><br>I found these 2 signs along Mountbatten Rd vv weird...<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Sign1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Sign1.JPG</a><br><br>Notice at the back of this pic there's "Nicoll Highway KEEP LEFT"<br><a href="http://&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Sign2.JPG" rel="nofollow"><br>http://www.geocities.com/malsohmt/Sign2.JPG</a><br>Close up view.<br><br>Enjoy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>So am I right to say that the 6 SBST services will ply express between the junction of Jln Sultan/Victoria St and the junction of Mountbatten Rd/Guillemard Rd/Nicoll Highway?<br><br>Your photos cannot be viewed.<br><br>Saw the Tibs press release on CSS 608 route in the National Stadium area, cannot understand cause too confusing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

In the return direction, the service will be diverted to ply Bras Basah Road, Beach Road, Jalan Sultan, Sims Avenue, Geylang Lor 1 and Mountbatten Road.<br><br>For routing within National Stadium area used by Services 11, 16 and 401, there will be slight detour to the routing although all existing bus stops will continue to be served and will call in the same sequence.<br><br>For all diverted services, there will be no change in fares arising from the longer road diversion.<br><br>Bus Captains of affected services are being reminded of these changes. During this period, we have deployed Traffic Inspectors and patrol cars at the diverted road junctions to assist the Bus Captains. Notices have been put up at bus interchanges and at bus stops along the affected roads. Similar notices are also displayed on the bus windscreen of the above services to inform commuters. Commuters travelling to and from the affected road can board and alight at the bus stops along the diverted routes.<br>During this period of diversion, commuters may experience some service irregularities as we expect higher traffic volumes along the diverted routes as well as changes in the travelling pattern of our commuters. To cater to these changes, nine more buses have been added to the affected services to improve the headway and capacity. We wish to seek the understanding from commuters for any inconvenience caused.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/whatsnew_21april2004.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/whatsnew_21april2004.asp</a><br></div>
