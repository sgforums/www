              <p>Hi Mr Dudup77, I don't quite get your logic. If the route was a
              bi-directional NBR-Punggol service, it would be much shorter than
              its current routing (longer overall but D1/D2 would be shorter). If
              route length was such an issue, why didn't LTA simply cut it to Lor
              1 Geylang when the terminal still had space at that point in time.
              Having a long loop service versus two D1/D2 is always much better
              for reliability and fleet management. </p>

              <p>That's the point you see. Rather than adding fleet to existing services, you create a separate service to provide an alternative to the neighborhood. 972 in some ways compliments 190 by providing BPJ residents with an alternative connection to Orchard Rd. Even though it serves a different stretch of BPJ, these residents would have still relied on 190/700 anyway, prior to the introduction of DTL2. And adding fleet in this case is mutually exclusive to the debate. LTA, after all, added fleet after a new service was introduced. It did so because it felt that having recently introduced a new service, introducing another new service was not warranted. Your example falls through. If you tell us that LTA only added fleet to 190 and 700 without introducing 972, then it would hold more water. </p>
              <p>Can you cite examples of routes where adding fleet would have been better than creating a complimentary service?</p>

              According to LTA, there is demand from hougang st 11 to kovan
              station. Therefore they are unable to make 113 skip this stretch
              and extend to serangoon int. According to PTC, public transport
              operators are required to put up bus arrival timings at the bus

              <p>Too many service, for essentially one stretch of road. In the first place most svcs there have potential to become express. Eg. 61, 157. All these svcs along the road mostly serve ONE purpose: bringing commuters along BKT road. Hence only one or two svcs are actl needed, and other svcs could be made express. It actually benefits commuters for these svcs as they have faster connection eg. Boon Lay - TPY. </p>
              <p>Better than have more of one or two (preferably short) svcs than less of more. In fact, even before DTL runs most buses run half-empty along BKT road. Leave alone now. </p>
              <p>Regarding 972, it was intro coz it was express, otherwise dream on abt having a new legendary svc.</p>

              When DTL3 is up, can convert 66/67 semi-express alr to compete with DTL3. Who wants to take DTL from BPJ to Jln Besar/Bendemeer? You are waisting your precious 20 mins around the CBD.
              IMHO, people would prefer taking direct express buses to winding DTL/transfer here and there.

              <p>Well 53M is made so that it stops at the same stop as 53 which goes towards Upper Paya Lebar, so people have 2 choices. Same goes to 43M, stopping at the same stop as 43 which goes towards Buangkok. By changing the routing of 53M to bypass Serangoon Int would make it not that feasible to loop around and pass by that stop.</p>

              <p>Sure. </p>
              <p>The Bukit Timah corridor. </p>
              <p>Too many service, for essentially one stretch of road. In the
              first place most svcs there have potential to become express. Eg.
              61, 157. All these svcs along the road mostly serve ONE purpose:
              bringing commuters along BKT road. Hence only one or two svcs are
              actl needed, and other svcs could be made express. It actually
              benefits commuters for these svcs as they have faster connection
              eg. Boon Lay - TPY. </p>
              <p>Better than have more of one or two (preferably short) svcs than
              less of more. In fact, even before DTL runs most buses run
              half-empty along BKT road. Leave alone now. </p>
              <p>Regarding 972, it was intro coz it was express, otherwise dream
              on abt having a new legendary svc.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>While I agree that some services can be made express, only leaving 1 or 2 services are NOT enough.</p>
              <p>Residents along Bukit Timah and students in the various schools have demand to various places that cannot be served by just 1 or 2 services. To the west: Clementi (154, 156), Bukit Batok (66, 67, 77, 157, 174, 852), CCK/BPJ (67, 170, 171, 961), Jurong West (157, 174); To the north: Ang Mo Kio (74, 852), Toa Payoh (151, 154, 157); To city: Little India (48, 66, 67, 170), Orchard (171, 174); etc.</p>
              <p>You need to understand that students here can come from all parts of Singapore... And even though DTL and CCL have taken away many students off the buses, there are still those who take the buses, and there are destinations where DTL doesn't really help (e.g. Clementi). Maybe we can make a few services express (my suggestion: 66, 151, 170), but don't have to leave only 1 or 2 (and force everyone to transfer at Beauty World??).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I don't think buses running half-empty along Bukit Timah Road was a common sight before DTL. In fact, the only ones with half-empty buses all day should be 852, and partly 151, 961. Off peak you may see more empty buses, but that's the case for all services in Singapore.</p>

              <p>You REALLY think any student in the right mind, would sit thru the entire BKT Rd and even before that, for 30+ stops before reaching sch? No luxury of time for that man. Usually students just board any bus they see, head to the nearest station, and take the train. This is, ofc, as a <span style="line-height: 1.231;">result of lack of fast bus routes in the region. </span></p>
              <p>I have already suggested COUNTLESS times, to make buses skip stops or even skip BKT road. And maybe svcs like 852 to fill in for the job.

              <p>With the DTL around, trust me, one or two svcs with decent freq is more than enough. Think of those who commute between east and west.

              <p>Okay your post reminds me that 151's loading is not so bad after all... Just that it's less than 74 and 154 which I take to Clementi Rd more often.

              <p>Talk about the pre-DTL days first: Are you sure 157 and 171 do not have demand? They are both popular student services (and by this I mean not just for students to go to nearest MRT) especially 157... If you really observe at some bus stops there you will really see crowds taking westbounds 157. And I am not even talking about weekends or evening peak when 171 can be packed to the door...</p>
              <p>DTL has taken away many students, of course (I see far less people at TKK bus stop now), but those are people staying further away (especially to the east). There are still plenty of people taking buses along Bukit Timah (and not just to connect to the nearest MRT stops). Do you think someone at NJC will take bus to Sixth Avenue, take DTL to King Albert Park, and transfer to 154 to Clementi; or will he just take 154 direct? Yes those staying all the way at CCK/BPJ take DTL, but those in Bukit Batok, Jurong etc, not really. And of course people still take 74 to AMK Hub instead of bus-DTL-CCL-NSL.</p>
              <p>I amnot getting into a war of words here, but I'm just saying what I observe. And leaving one single 852 for the whole Bukit Timah stretch is not the solution. Yes, there is demand from let's say Bukit Batok to Toa Payoh, but I don't think that means demand coming from the stops inbetween can be compromised.</p>

              <p>My observation for 157 is eastbound... To clarify.</p>
              <p>The issue at hand is hence, we need not so many svcs here. Fine, maybe some of those svcs here can do the role of 852... But svcs like 67, 157 (can do uni- directional semi-express) rly not needed lor... We could easily fleet add to them if needed. </p>
              <p>My baseline being: it is okay for alternatives for ppl, so long as it doesnt unnecessarily put long-distance commuters at a disadvantage. When it does, fleet add does wonders.</p>
