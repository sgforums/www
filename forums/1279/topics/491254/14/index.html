              <p>I dont quite get your logic too. How could a long loop be any
              better than bi-di svc in terms of RELIABILITY and FLEET MANAGEMENT?
              No proof no talk. And what do you have to support this statement of
              yours?</p>
              <p>In fact, I give you MY examples. Svc 23, 24 are amongst the
              divas who never fail to piss commuters off. Show me ONE service
              that is bi-di (and isnt legendary svc) and has horrible
              reliability. Do it!</p>

              <p>Guys.. please take 23 first before talking about extension.. 23 needs to maintain the loop at Rochor Canal Road... If you see every 23 DD will have min. 25-30 pax at the looping point, if not more.</p>
              <p>If you take 23 out, there needs to be a replacement. Extending to Orchard or NBR will make it either parallel to 65 or 147 right from MOM/Bendemeer and I don't see the point.</p>

              <p>116: Introduced partly to ease 315's crowd from Serangoon to
              Serangoon North. But somehow people still preferred to take 315
              although it is more winding. In the end 116 has less satisfactory
              loading, and 315 still received fleet additions.</p>
              <p>258: Supposed to ease 243's crowd from Boon Lay Int, but again
              people don't recognise 258 even when it arrives before 243.</p>

              <p>315 got 7 fleet add even though 116 was launched... 116 just acts as back up service to 315 and 72. The fact that 116 is opp NEX, people don't bother taking from there. 116 loading is 15-25 pax during PM peak. 116 loading is better from HCI to  HG Ave 9 during PM as bus stop is right outside MRT exit. </p>

              <p>Well 53M is made so that it stops at the same stop as 53 which
              goes towards Upper Paya Lebar, so people have 2 choices. Same goes
              to 43M, stopping at the same stop as 43 which goes towards
              Buangkok. By changing the routing of 53M to bypass Serangoon Int
              would make it not that feasible to loop around and pass by that

              <p>If 53M becomes 113 from Serangoon Int, it will call at same stop as 45 at Upp serangoon road, yet providing a common stop just not to 53 but 45.</p>

              <p>Okay your post reminds me that 151's loading is not so bad after
              all... Just that it's less than 74 and 154 which I take to Clementi
              Rd more often. But your statement that I'm not familiar with the
              loading really made me laugh<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;">.</span></span></p>
              <p>Talk about the pre-DTL days first: Are you sure 157 and 171 do
              not have demand? They are both popular student services (and by
              this I mean not just for students to go to nearest MRT) especially
              157... If you really observe at some bus stops there you will
              really see crowds taking westbounds 157. And I am not even talking
              about weekends or evening peak when 171 can be packed to the
              door...</p>
              <p>DTL has taken away many students, of course (I see far less
              people at TKK bus stop now), but those are people staying further
              away (especially to the east). There are still plenty of people
              taking buses along Bukit Timah (and not just to connect to the
              nearest MRT stops). Do you think someone at NJC will take bus to
              Sixth Avenue, take DTL to King Albert Park, and transfer to 154 to
              Clementi; or will he just take 154 direct? Yes those staying all
              the way at CCK/BPJ take DTL, but those in Bukit Batok, Jurong etc,
              not really. And of course people still take 74 to AMK Hub instead
              of bus-DTL-CCL-NSL.</p>
              <p>I amnot getting into a war of words here, but I'm just saying
              what I observe. And leaving one single 852 for the whole Bukit
              Timah stretch is not the solution. Yes, there is demand from let's
              say Bukit Batok to Toa Payoh, but I don't think that means demand
              coming from the stops inbetween can be compromised.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>From what I sense from your posts you live on Bukit Timah road, so you will know the loading best there.</p>
              <p>My observation of 151 is that the loading along Bukit Timah depends hugely on 154's arrival at the stop.</p>
              <p>But 151 definitely has high loading between Macpherson-Airport road to Hougang where it provides unique connection. </p>

                  23 DD will have min. 25-30 pax at the looping point, if not
                  more.</p>
              <p>If you take 23 out, there needs to be a replacement. Extending
                  to Orchard or NBR will make it either parallel to 65 or 147 right
                  from MOM/Bendemeer and I don't see the point.</p>

              <p>Don't you think Tampines really needs a semi-express service to Orchard or NBR or even CBD? 23 is the prime candidate. You can always introduce 23M looping at Rochor Canal Rd for the full DDs with Indian workers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, take connecting buses to tampines Ave 2 or 1 and transfer to sbs 518 express to Scotts/orchard/suntec. No need touch sbs 23. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Modifying 23 will cause immense inconvenience to people. As mentioned there is 65/147 in parallel from MOM/Bendemeer to different parts of city. Don't see any reason/logic why 23 should be touched when it provides unique connection for Jalan Besar/Serangoon road that is quite far to walk. This is the Tampines direct connection people want to go direct to Serangoon road.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, interestingly it was stated in the press release that "This will make it more convenient for students to get to school and BACK." Wonder how is that applicable if 181M does not operate in the afternoon.</p>

              <p>Hi mr azharjj, it is very suprising that the nearest bus interchange does not provide a direct bus service to jurong west st 23 even though this is in the vicinity until this sbs 181M comes along. It needs a bus from as far as buona vista terminal to provide sbs 185 to this area instead. Anybody staying around that area could provide an explanation? Where is jurongresident or jurongwestresident or gekpohboy when we need him? When we don't need him, he is always around in this forum. When we need him, he cannot be found. So ironical. Cheers.

              <p>Hi Mr dupdup77, I have already responded to this announcement of new bus service 181M, with a response in both this thread and the thread on press releases. You may want to scroll up this page, and/or refer to page 3 of the thread "Press Releases in 2016". Cheers. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Well, 181M is just a supplementary bus service of 181. It may be withdrawn eventually, if 181 is extended to loop via Jurong West Street 22/23/24.</p>
              
              
              <p>Anyway, I feel that we have had enough discussions about 181M. Let us move on to discuss other new bus services announced by LTA/PTOs. :)</p>

              <p>Actually, I feel that the new bus stop of 181(M) at opposite Corporation Primary School may not be of much use.</p>
                                                                                          <p>When I was a student of a secondary school near Jurong West Avenue 3, from year 2009 to year 2012, I usually travelled on either bus 181 or 185 between Jurong West Avenue 5 and Jurong West Avenue 3.</p> <p>In the morning when the bus was at Jurong West Avenue 3, I often saw students of corporation primary school walking along Jurong West Street 24 to get to their school, with their parents accompanying them. In the evening when I go back home after school, I sometimes saw them walk in the reverse direction back to Jurong West Avenue 3.</p>
                                                                                          <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> This has been the practice for many years, probably since that time when the school relocated to Jurong West Street 24. Having been accustomed to walking along Jurong West Street 24 between Jurong West Avenue 3 and their school, I do not think they will change to take bus 181M to their school.</p>
                                                                                          <p>Nonetheless, there are students of Corporation Primary School who take bus 181 to Jurong West Avenue 3 and walk along Jurong West Street 24 to get to their school. They are probably the only ones who will really benefit from new bus service 181M. However, without any afternoon or evening trip of bus 181M, I think after a while they will revert to alight at Jurong West Avenue 3 and walk to their school.</p>
                                                                                          <p>Come to think about it, this new bus service 181M may be quite useless... hmm. :/</p>
                                                                                          <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> Please pardon me if my english is not good. It is because of this that's why I did not (dare to) say which secondary school I was from, but merely described it as "a secondary school near Jurong West Avenue 3". Sadly, over the years after I leave secondary school, my english has deteroited :( ... I am still a confident communicator, though.... and I still show care, concern, compassion to my fellow friends :)</p>

                  Avenue 3. In the morning when the bus was at Jurong West Avenue 3,
                  I often saw students of corporation primary school walking along
                  Jurong West Street 24 to get to their school, with their parents
                  accompanying them. In the evening when I go back home after school,
                  I sometimes saw them walk in the reverse direction back to Jurong
                  West Avenue 3.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> This has been the practice for many years,
                  probably since that time when the school relocated to Jurong West
                  Street 24. Having been accustomed to walking along Jurong West
                  Street 24 between Jurong West Avenue 3 and their school, I do not
                  think they will change to take bus 181M to their school.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, there are students of Corporation Primary School
                  who take bus 181 to Jurong West Avenue 3 and walk along Jurong West
                  Street 24 to get to their school. They are probably the only ones
                  who will really benefit from new bus service 181M. However, without
                  any afternoon or evening trip of bus 181M, I think after a while
                  they will revert to alight at Jurong West Avenue 3 and walk to
                  their school.</p>
              <p>Come to think about it, this new bus service 181M may be quite
                  useless... hmm. :/</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> Please pardon me if my english is not good. It
                  is because of this that's why I did not (dare to) say which
                  secondary school I was from, but merely described it as "a
                  secondary school near Jurong West Avenue 3". Sadly, over the years
                  after I leave secondary school, my english has deteroited :( ... I
                  am still a confident communicator, though.... and I still show
                  care, concern, compassion to my fellow friends :)</p>

              <p>Obviously the students walk along St 24 because there are no other choices... Given 181M right at their doorstep do you really think students coming to school will still alight at Ave 3 and walk there?</p>
              <p>And 181 will not be in operation during the operational hours of 181M.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, 181M doesn't seem to be a really well utilised SWT considering it only operates at AM peak, instead, I feel that it should revise its operating hours as follows:</p>
              <p>6:30am-8am, 1pm-3pm, 5:30pm-7:15pm instead or convert it into something similar to 70M/133M/700A where 181M can operate on weekdays until like 7 or 8pm before operating as 181 with no operation on weekends and school holidays.</p>
              <p>I believe this service will help the students as it gives them a second bus that stops at their school for their convenience, but the operating hours really needs to be extended as the service seems to be solely used to cater for the students to go to school during AM peak.</p>
              <p>Also, it may cause confusion for some commuters who wait for the bus at bus stop 27461 Opp Blk 276B as they are used to waiting at that bus stop for 181 but now they need to cross to the other side of the road as 181 does not operate during specific timing during AM peak.</p>
              <p>Off topic: I'm curious if they will print 181M destos for the batch 2 VO3X upon commencing operation of 181M.</p>
