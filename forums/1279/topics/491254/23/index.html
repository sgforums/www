              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, surprisingly Eunos bus interchange seems to be
              ultra quiet. Not many passengers at all. Wondered why? Lack of a
              major mall? Bus interchange next to eunos MRT yet crowd is even
              lesser than that of Punggol or sengkang interchange. Other bus
              interchanges are short of berths yet eunos has so many extra not
              used. Before adding 76 and 150 to eunos, there are 5 empty
              passengers boarding berth/queues. After adding, still got 3 more
              extra queuing berths. Hope sbs 76 amendment to eunos will bring
              more load to eunos area. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Eunos has never been a crowded place. It might be the only
              multi-modal interchange in Singapore, other than HarbourFront and
              Joo Koon, that is not built in a town centre.</p>
              <p>The town centre has traditionally always been along
              Changi/Geylang Roads from Geylang Serai Market/Joo Chiat Complex to
              City Plaza.</p>
              <p>Most transfer activity in Eunos has always occured along Jalan
              Eunos, rather than the interchange, except during peak hours where
              passengers want a seat on routes 60, 63 and 94.</p>

                          <p>Eunos Bus Interchange is to complement Bedok Bus Interchange to serve the people in Bedok, as the capacity of Bedok Bus Interchange is limited.</p>
                          <p>The other reason is probably because there is a bus terminal at Kallang MRT Station serving Aljunied area, so they have the bus interchange at Eunos MRT Station to serve Bedok area, to maximise resources.</p>

              <p>24 is reliable??!!</p>
              <p>Coming from a daily commuter of 24 in its eastern stretch I can
              tell you it is the contrary.</p>
              <p>24 should consider skipping certain sectors of its route, to
              shorten its travel time while retaining its full route. CGA svcs
              also desperately need a terminating point. It's time. </p>

              <p>Im afraid they would touch Sv 24 and end it at Eunos as well but
              if they really do so that means LTA is not focusing on reliability
              already as 24 is very reliable even though it is a super long loop
              service.</p>

              <p>70M,107M,162M and 700A no need terminus as they terminate at Shenton Way during specific times.The Coach shouldnt park at the new Marina Ctr Ter in the first place.If every loop trunk need terminate point in order to enhance frequencies then might as well dont introduce loop service.36,857,966 i agree cause theyre too long but service like 15,55,135 &amp; 155 simply doesnt need a terminus.They can compensate BCs by having more break times at the Interchanges.76 already a wasted resource and we dont want that to happen anymore.LTA also not too free to built more terminals just for the sake of it.The bus plannings is getting more crap than before.</p>
