              <p>4 should def get a proper berth (replacing sv 18) since it has good loading from interchange. 20 on the other hand does not have many people boarding, mostly starts aroung ave 2 towards Simei, so okay. 127 should also get proper berth (replacing sv 39) and will be on same berth as sv 72 to help relieve each others' loading.</p>

              <p>Ofcourse 129 will be faster. It is express from Bartley MRT onwards till it hits Tampines town. Otherwise you have to take CCL and then transfer at Paya Lebar. </p>
              <p>+ I don't foresee any traffic on Bartley road east viaduct.</p>
              <p>23 cannot be compared as their routes don't even intersect except for the Tampines town bit.</p>

              <p>Hi mr autumncs, service 129 seems a well planned route. A
              distance of around 20km too. Just nice! Not too short either.
              Connect three towns tampines, toa payoh and whampoa with enough
              catchment area to support it. One thing I like is the middle
              semi-express portion. Nowadays, need some semi-express route to
              give the journey an added boost in terms of timing. Cheers.

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, yes it is semi-express. It passes the stretch of Bartley road east non-stop but it stops at selected stops along Bartley road before continuing to braddel road, etc. For Bartley road, it stops at Bartley mrt and Bartley church before it goes semi express again then reaches braddell. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>This is not the first time that a route is forced to have

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lan lan suck thumb
                  example 1: Svc 168</span><br> When 168 was first introduced, the portion between Woodlands Ave 2
                  and Tampines Ave 10 was non-stop.<br> Then, a stop at Jln Kayu was added. (I was fine with that
                  initially.)<br> Then, the exit from TPE (east-bound) to Jln Kayu changed from a
                  slip road into a traffic-light. <br> Then, a stop at TPE (near Punggol Rd) was added. <br> Then, there's a new traffic light at Seletar Aerospace
                  Flyover. <br> Compared to the original route, the current route has 2 additional
                  stops... and 4 additional traffic lights eastbound or 6 traffic
                  lights westbound (including 4 traffic lights on Jln Kayu Flyover
                  alone)...</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lan lan suck thumb
                  example 2: Svc 502</span><br> This express service used to be the fastest between Orchard and
                  Jurong East.<br> Then, SBS changed it into a uni-directional route downtown and
                  added Bayfront Avenue. (If you board at Orchard, you're forced to
                  take a tour of Suntec and Bayfront before hitting the
                  expressway.) <br> Then, thanks to the opening of MCE and closure of ECP, svc 502 was
                  diverted to serve Central Blvd, Shenton Way and Keppel
                  Rd. <br> I stopped taking 502 from Orchard to Jurong ever since.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, LTA would justify the addition of stops "for
                  the benefit of more passengers". At the end of the day, bus routes
                  are designed to maximise catchment and hence maximise revenue...
                   </p>
              <p>The only wise decision I have seen recently is the amendment of

              <p>Even 518 is a shining example... </p>

              <p>2. Passengers who wish to board 518 there could simply walk over to the MBS bus stop via the MRT station, making that stop completely irrelevant</p>
              <p>But ofc LTA was stubborn/lazy af, so now under the usual route commuters suffer 3 new traffic lights... The longest one was the one turning into the expy, takes 2-3 mins alone to change signal...</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, yes it is semi-express. It passes the stretch of

              <p>Even though MRT will be faster (not way faster), 129 is direct without transfer. Moreover, exit of Tampines DTL3 is quite far from Century/Tampines Mall. In addition, if someone is not going close to MRT, 129 will give direct access or quick transfer points within Tampines town, rather than alighting at Tampines MRT, walking to interchange and queuing at berth.</p>
