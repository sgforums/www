              <p>May I know why it is nt necessary? I believe it is somehow good if there is access to ECP via Bedok instead of the need to walk from Marine Parade to ECP or even taking 36 alighting at one end of ECP to walk over to somewhere near Big Splash...</p>

              <p>When I mean full-day service I mean 7 days a week, ok. Please read comments carefully.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying ECP won't receive any bus service. 401 currently operates on Saturday afternoons/evenings and on full-day on Sunday. This service will definitely be retained. What I've heard more of is a 401-inspired route or a 401M service. I agree that the latter will be quite useless. Also, having a bus service operate the full stretch of ECP 7 days a week will also be quite useless, for obvious reasons. </p>
              <p>Then again, these are just rumours. Take it with a pinch of salt, as you would with most stuff on this forum. </p>

              <p>When you say 'Because it might not ply ECP Svc Rd anymore', the natural inference from us is that there will be no more links to ECP, simply just because there is no mention of a replacement in the same post and that the assumption (I take it that the others viewed it as an assumption but not a rumour, because your first sentence seemed to imply that you are asking us if we had heard rumours, not that you heard rumours about the changes) was rather unbelievable and impossible.</p>

              <p>Yes, there is some truth to that statement, though I wouldn't say overcrowded, but still crowded nonetheless (DD can get standees but it depends on the frequency). Basically 14 links Bedok North Rd (part not served by 45) with Bedok South Secondary School and Temasek Sec/Pri. In the afternoon, 14's frequency can be quite poor because buses originate from Clementi. So when it arrive at intervals greater than 15 mins, it can get fairly crowded. 46 at least serves Temasek Sec/Pri. And of course, I should add that 46 goes on to serve Bedok Reservoir and Tampines West, which is an added benefit.</p>

              <p>46 and 14 serve very different routes. The only common part is some UEC stops and Bedok North Road/Upper Changi. </p>
              <p>14 will still be overcrowded as it connects Tanah Merah to the populous Bedok North Road.</p>
              <p>46 on other hand has only handful people between UEC and Bedok North Road. It serves as a 2-stop service for those transferring from New Upp Changi Road to Bedok North Road or Bedok North Ave 3. </p>
              <p>46's usability will increase only after DTL3 opens.</p>
              <p>Route could have been better planned.</p>
              <p>Would have been good if 46 would have been CBP - Tanah Merah - Bedok North Road - Tampines West - Pasir Ris. </p>

              <p>Yes... Dont know whats with Tamp that made PTOs continue to cram svcs in the already-bursting int like no mother... Any new svc in the far east, must terminate Tampines... PSR on the other hand totally neglected even tho all it needs for svcs to get there from tamp is a bridge ride across...</p>

              <p>As I have raised up in the Route Suggestions thread, the GAG map that was leaked showed 518 routing to be KPE -&gt; PIE instead of ECP. This could be a sign that GAG may be amending its route very soon. </p>
              <p>Its about time too. Ever since the KPE opened there is no excuse for ditching ECP since it is slower in terms of travelling time. </p>
              <p>Maybe they should cancel out Bayfront Stn stop too, since this would allow 518 to take a shortcut up the expy and there is a MBS stop readily available.</p>
