              <p>But bendies may be a thing of the past after 2017 so don't worry. SMRT will keesiao de-register all the non-WAB bendies aimlessly and randomly when more double decker buses are delivered to all routes, especially the Sungei Seletar GCM. By the time Woodlands North Interchange open only 40 bendies will be present, just nice for the remaining sector (Choa Chu Kang - 20 bendies, Bukit Panjang, Woodlands - 20 bendies, Sembawang).</p>

              <p>There is demand on 964 bro. Otherwise stingy SMRT would not deploy so many high capacity buses. I went there 2-3 times last 2 weeks. Though I was in car could observe DDs/bendies every 03 mins picking up 80-100 pax. Upper deck/lower deck both full. Bendies also. </p>
              <p>169 number of buses is okay. I said before it needs more HC buses, not more A22s.</p>
