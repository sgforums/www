              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>It is probably because 805 is a feeder bus service.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, 258 only has six buses, with a poor frequency of at
              least ten minutes, and it is very un-reliable at Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange.</p>
              <p>I understand 258 is supposed to relieve loading off 243G and
              181, but... at least put 258 in the same berth as 243G mah... :(
              anyway, 258 loading is quite encouraging...</p>
              <p>but, really, 258 only has six buses, whereas 49 at lakeside has
              so many buses and the frequency is better. so unfair. :(</p>
              <p>why LTA did not deploy a mixture of bus models on 258, like some
              dd some sd.. then the frequency can be slightly better.</p>
              <p>... but at least put 258 next to 243G at Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange leh....</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, feeder bus 242 also experiencing long queues. it
              would be good if we can re-route 258 to help 242 with the loading
              going to/fro Jurong West Street 72.</p>
              <p>generally, I am glad that LTA at least introduced 258, but I am
              disappointed that LTA did not maximise the potential of 258 in
              improving and enhancing the bus connections in Jurong West. If I
              were to rate 258, out of ten points I would only give around five
              or six. There are at least two rooms for improvement.</p>
              <p>first room for improvement: enhance frequency.</p>
              <p>second room for improvement: re-route to serve street 72, to
              help relieve 242 high loading.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, agree that 258 could be done much better with a beefed up frequency with the link to Pioneer MRT. By the way, Mr. Jurong resident, what's the rationale in creating so many duplicate accounts lol when it's inherently obvious that it's you lol</p>

                      <p>With regards to 258, I feel that the link to Pioneer MRT is only a minor objective of the service. The main objectives is to provide bus connections between Jurong West Extension town and the jurong industrial estate (JIE) bus services (ie. 182, 253, 254, 255, 257) at Joo Koon Bus Interchange. The other main objective is to complement the high loading on bus services along Jurong West Street 64/75 during peak hours. The first main objective is definitely an objective of 258, and this alone already warrants an enhancement in the frequency to match the frequency on the JIE bus services. If the second main objective is not an objective of 258, I feel that the LTA should introduce a new bus service for Jurong West Neighbourhood 7 (street 75, street 72 and avenue 5) - or even revamp the feeder bus routes in Jurong West Extension altogether.</p>
                      <p>Here, I would like to comment on Jurong West Street 81 and Jurong West Street 91. According to the URA Master Plan 1994 and 2003, JW St 81 and St 91 are primary access roads, like Jurong West Street 65 and Street 76. Yet, JW St 81 has 243 (and 258) running in both directions and JW St 91 has 99 running in both directions. I am not sure if primary access roads are really suitable for bus routes to run in both directions. If they are not suitable, I feel that 99 should be reverted to loop at Jurong West Street 91, otherwise bypass the looping area via Street 92 (which is a minor arterial road). For 258, .... actually, I heard that 258 was actually introduced to replace 192, so why not let it ply the 192 route (the one until 2015), or at least bypass st 81 via ave 5 (a minor arterial road)? Whereas for 243, I feel that it should loop from Ave 5 to St 82. Meanwhile, we can have another feeder that loops from Ave 5 to St 72. There will be a loss of bus connections, but on the bright side, this would reduce the loading on the feeder bus services, and prompt the bus company to introduce SWT at the heavily-utilised section at St 64/75.</p>

              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>No more confusion on whether to take sv 32 or 122 for residents of Margaret</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>Longer walking for Dawson residents to stop of 122</p>
              <p>Overall IMO good decision to have same bus stop for 32/122.</p>

              <p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Very clear LTA wants to ensure that new services avoid heavily duplicating existing services especially between MP &amp; Paya Lebar. LTA also trying to wean off long-haul duplicitous services (like 43 &amp; 76) so that existing resources can be re-deployed to fill in gaps. Between 43 &amp; 76, 76 is a better candidate to be truncated. This is the big problem in the East - too many sama-sama long-distance routes, and many short-haul gaps that need to be filled. </p>
              <p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">With this in mind, there is an opportunity to re-deploy 76 to serve East Coast Rd or Geylang Rd. But knowing LTA, I suspect they're trying to hit their KPIs by cutting 76s' fleet. The BSEP window is closing as 2017 is coming up, so they will be very conservative I suspect over the next year. </p>
              <p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Also suspect the next service on the chopping board will be 13. And a new Eunos-Joo Chiat - Marine Terrace service might be introduced.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I would like to see 76 continue its route to marine terr but the Amber Rd and marine parade road (blk 72) bus stops skipped to amend it to ply east coast road and follow 47 back to marine parade (chij Katong pri), loop at marine terr and back to east coast road.</p>
              <p>It will replace the long forgotten Css 608 that used to stop at marine parade road (blk 57) and went to east coast rd (church of holy family), there were considerable amount of pax using that route to alight at east coast road from marine parade blk 57.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">East coast road could do with another bus service from marine parade to east coast rd in both directions just like Css608.</span></p>
              <p>Sv134 can replace sv76 route to marine terr as per normal.</p>
              <p>But most likely this case it would not happen because sv76 would highly likely serve the eunos area as per mentioned but maybe in the future sv 43/135 may be routed to end at marine terrace maybe?</p>
