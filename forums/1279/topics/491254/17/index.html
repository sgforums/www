              <p>Brief translation of article:</p>
              <p><strong>Turning hobby into job, </strong><strong>30 year-old bus enthusiast - now a route planner - shortens Sv 76</strong></p>
              <p>1.
                       Mr Tan Hao Rui (direct translation, might not be accurate) joined LTA's
                       Policy and Planning Group 4.5 years ago out of his interest in buses. 
                      He is currently a Senior Transport Planner under Bus Planning Dept.</p>
              <p>2. He has delved into bus photography, bus spotting, advert spotting etc. in his younger days.</p>
              <p>3.
                       He outlined various phases in route planning - understanding commuters'
                       travelling patterns and needs, field investigation, resource allocation
                       for new routes, how to connect key nodes etc.</p>
              <p>4. Has spent the 
                      past 4 years (seriously?!) shortening/amending Sv 76, which will cease 
                      to loop at Marine Terr this coming 20th Mar to become a bi-directional 
                      service.</p>
              <p>5. He derives job satisfaction from providing greater 
                      convenience to commuters. (Ok... I can't seem to see how cutting Sv 76 
                      and making people alight and wait for Sv 134 is really more convenient 
                      just to solve the reliability issues of long loop service. As many on the 
                      forums have said, there are other avenues to alleviate the long headways
                       at the looping end.)</p>
              <p>6. Ever since he joined LTA, he has been 
                      explaining to friends and relatives the constraints and unfavourable 
                      road conditions that bus services are subject to. Has also been taking 
                      feedback and recommendations from them.</p>
              <p>7. Lastly, he said that 
                      resource allocation are based on needs. (Not much surprise here, though 
                      it's hard to explain the excesses of Sv 120/121/122, Sv 102/324 and Sv 
                      150's duplication with Sv 13/15/155/966.)</p>

I would think that the previous amendment a couple of years ago should have helped ensure better reliability in some way or another.
