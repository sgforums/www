              <p>Bulim Depot is very near to Tengah. Most likely Bulim will take

              <p>I think Jurong East and the 4 CLE routes will get transferred to Clementi contract, based out of Ulu Pandan. 174 can go over to Bulim or Jurong West since it doesn't pass anywhere near Clementi or Queenstown area.</p>

              <p>yup. already went to guang ming shan as early as 2010... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, 2022 is six years from now, and the entire Tengah would probably be developed only at around 2052.</p>
              <p>indeed, it may be too early to talk about Tengah. let's talk about something else instead.</p>

              <p>Bus route 174 will eventually serve Tengah, when Jurong Road is
              replaced.</p>
              <p>I'm expecting up to eleven new bus routes at Tengah, considering
              Tengah will eventually have 42,000 units of residential
              apartments.</p>
              <p>Tengah's new bus routes are in the Bulim BCM package.</p>
              <p>The future Tengah bus interchange should be around the same size
              as Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope that the Jurong Region Line stations interval
              is at least 1km... anyway, the concept drawings of JID and Tengah
              seem to suggest that the NTU branch connects to Tengah only.</p>
              <p>(if two different concept drawings say the same thing, most
              likely it's true.)</p>
              <p>I guess Jurong Region Line essentially comprises of one main
              line from CCK to JE, one line from Tengah to NTU and one line from
              Tengah to Boon Lay and Jurong Hill.</p>
              <p>The Boon Lay line is probably underground and could potentially
              become the so-called "Holland Line"...</p>
              <p>(which seem to gel well with the CRL report on alternative
              routing. secondly, why need another line to the city when we can
              have that potential "holland line" run to Woodlands and connect
              with that other spur line of CRL, to form a line that runs direct
              from Jurong to Punggol? ;))</p>
              <p>but seriously, if the NTU line is essentially a branch line,
              there's no need to squeeze along Jurong West Street 75 and 82. Can
              just glide along Jalan Bahar, where there's much more space
              there.</p>
              <p><strong>I have a feeling that the reason why Pioneer Sec will close is
              actually because of this Jurong Region Line... wonder what's the
              merged name. Joo Koon is a possibility, since the two schools are
              Boon Lay and Pioneer. lol.</strong></p>
              <p>and hor, I'm kinda expecting the depot at Bulim Avenue to be
              similar to the NEL depot at Sengkang, except this one also have bus
              depot; train depots at B1 and L2, bus depot at L1.</p>

              <p>Let's introduce service if only really needed. Don't need anymore services like 46 and 150. </p>
              <p>But I am sure there will be a new service for Canberra coming up in Q4. BTOs have opened up for occupancy.</p>

              <p>I still feel they should have diverted 117 to Canberra Estate. This way 117 would have served Sembawang-Yishun MRT + allow those going forward to Khatib, Seletar, Punggol etc. to have a direct service. Moreover, 117 has enough capacity to handle the load right now.</p>
              <p>Most of the BTOs will anyway be coming up end 2017/2018.</p>
