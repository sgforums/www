              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, no to remove 969. I expect significant human
                      traffic around tampines concourse bus stops and 969 traffic is

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, the reason is also in the 3.41pm message. It is 'I expect significant human traffic around tampines concourse bus stops and 969 traffic is going to get even worse.' This implies human traffic flow for smrt 969 is expected to worsen. Thus queueing time and journey time will be lengthened. Once lengthened, people will complain. Take note in the past, without TPE stop, it is much faster. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>DTL3 does not mean that there will be more traffic for 969.. you are assuming only...basically the ppl taking DTL3 are either currently taking buses or EWL...how many of those driving cars will switch to DTL3? </p>
              <p>why you are still talking in the past? in the past, it might be much faster, but it is higher chance that u cant board 969 (when there is lot of rigids) and there are alway jam at SLE/TPE (before the widening) .so u might have to wait a few buses... now 969 is almost full fleet DDs... and after the widening of TPE/SLE area , there are less jam and travelling time is much faster.. </p>

              <p>All, I expect many complaints for amended service 969. Many long

              Last time they already endured 1 extra TPE stop. Now 3 more to go.
              As usual, it is still considered quite express. Journey time will
              be lengthened by another 5-6 mins. </p>
              <p>Travellers can only suck thumb. As always, if a bus service
              needs to pass by a certain route (amended or otherwise) on the way
              to interchange, it has to stop at the bus stops no matter what.

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, they select 18 and 39 which look not too bad selections. 18 to connects to east side while 39 connects to north area via pasir ris. They also start new service 129 there. Not bad to have 3 to coincide with the opening on 18 dec 2016.</p>
              <p>Lucky they did not start 127 at tampines concourse interchange. For a looping route, it is wiser to connect to the main tampines interchange via tampines concourse, providing more convenient short TRUNK services (acting like feeder) for the tampines industrial area to both interchanges as a result (via bus stop outside tampines concourse for the 2nd interchange). I dare say 127 is well planned short route with potential for improvement once industrial area is more developed. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes I think they do their homework. Feeder services will need to be at main interchange. Anyway I also don't like the whole tampines area. Super squeezy and super packed with human beings. It is like everybody is in a mad rush. So many bus services and so little spaces. Still packed with eateries and other small shops. Furthermore, some times food outlets still with queues end up blocking partially. Don't you think the layout needs a change? Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I agree absolutely! If LTA dare to pull this stun off they'll certainly get a ton of complaints! Already there are people complaining about the extra stops on Tampines Concourse, would you imagine the furor if 969 shifts its terminus to Tampines Concourse Interchange instead?</p>

              <p>For me I am OK with the 3 additional stops either way. People think that "no stops" is good but it can be slow if the traffic lights are not optimized for the bus. Right now the 969 that I'm on right now has stopped at red lights for at least 3 times before even entering TPE (about 1 minute each) so if going through Tampines Concourse results in a net faster journey, then I'd greatly accept it!</p>
              <p>In any case if you want a faster journey you should plead LTA to stop padding the bus schedules so much. Bef Punggol Rd/TPE stop to Khatib MRT in 20 mins? Come on, pre-GCM the same journey took at most 15 minutes!</p>
