              <p>Sometimes I wish there's a Fast Forward 168e which travels non-stop between Tampines Ave 7 and Woodlands Interchange (skipping Tampines Ave 9, Ave 10, all stops along TPE/SLE and Woodlands Ave 2). I don't mind paying express fare for that.</p>

              <p>Now that I think about it, could this interchange (Tampines
                      Concourse) be eventually replaced by another bus interchange at
                      Tampines North? Seems quite possible (and easy) to extend 18, 39,

              <p>Hi mr orange, this tampines concourse interchange is independent of the new tampines north interchange which will be built together with a mall in tampines street 62. Expect the future tampines north town to be super crowded like the tampines town. The tampines north town is just like for our kids generation! Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>For me I am OK with the 3 additional stops either way. People
              think that "no stops" is good but it can be slow if the traffic
              lights are not optimized for the bus. Right now the 969 that I'm on
              right now has stopped at red lights for at least 3 times before
              even entering TPE (about 1 minute each) so if going through
              Tampines Concourse results in a net faster journey, then I'd
              greatly accept it!</p>
              <p>In any case if you want a faster journey you should plead LTA to
              stop padding the bus schedules so much. Bef Punggol Rd/TPE stop to
              Khatib MRT in 20 mins? Come on, pre-GCM the same journey took at
              most 15 minutes!</p>

              <p>Hi mr autumncs, service 129 seems a well planned route. A distance of around 20km too. Just nice! Not too short either. Connect three towns tampines, toa payoh and whampoa with enough catchment area to support it. One thing I like is the middle semi-express portion. Nowadays, need some semi-express route to give the journey an added boost in terms of timing. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr lemon1974, it is not funny. At TPE stop, most people
              purposely wait for 969 to go tampines directly. After the
              amendment, they may feel that they no need to wait anymore for 969
              if 27/34 comes first. Now they still wait for 969 even though 27/34
              comes. The speed factor of 969 is somewhat diminished and the added
              incentive may not be there anymore. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Svc 969 is expected, sooner or later, when Tamp Nth is developed and Tamp Ave 12 is realigned, there will be stops there (It is part of the boundary of the town either way). Either way, still got Svc 127.</p>
              <p>Svc 129 route checks a lot of boxes IMO. Using Bartley Rd East, which in good conditions, connects Bishan/Serangoon with Tamp in 15-20 mins, TP to Ave 4 (Tamp West MRT), and serve the full stretch of Ave 4.</p>
              <p>Svc 127 is pretty much a complement service for Svc 72 (Svc 969 for AM return sector, seeing how packed Svc 969 is). Very high chance to amend to Tamp Nth.</p>
              <p>Svc 18 is expected to be thrown out of Tamp Int, since loading normally picks up around Ave 7, not sure about Svc 39 though, loading from Int is slowing going up (Still low enough though) and more pax will be pushed towards Svc 20/291/292 since Svc 39 no longer serve Tamp Int. Loading between towns still won't be affected though, since actual loadings only starts from Ave 5 onwards.</p>

              <p>I agree absolutely! If LTA dare to pull this stun off they'll
                  certainly get a ton of complaints! Already there are people
                  complaining about the extra stops on Tampines Concourse, would you
                  imagine the furor if 969 shifts its terminus to Tampines Concourse

              <p>Hi mr lesterwish, I think 127 will lose out. 4 and 20 will get the two berths. Anyway tampines main interchange net loss = 1 service. Hope it helps alleviate the bus situation there. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr autumncs, service 129 seems a well planned route. A
              distance of around 20km too. Just nice! Not too short either.
              Connect three towns tampines, toa payoh and whampoa with enough
              catchment area to support it. One thing I like is the middle
              semi-express portion. Nowadays, <strong>need some semi-express route to
              give the journey an added boost in terms of timing</strong>. Cheers.
              Thanks.</p>

              <p>No offence, though I would find it sad if LTA decides to pad the schedule so much that the buses have to crawl at 30 km/h along Bartley Road East. Semi-express route is not enough if it does not come with sensible scheduling. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Personally I think there is probably sufficient demand for such a service every 10 minutes during peak hours (perhaps alternate buses on svc 168 to run express/regular route). I also think there is sufficient demand for such a service that express fares shouldn't be necessary ...</p>
