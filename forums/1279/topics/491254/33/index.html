              <p>Maybe this SMRT reluctant to take in B9TL Wrights since they havent won any package yet?Theyre too obsessed with the MAN A22s/A95s.As for SBST they got no problem with B9TLs as theyre the one who ordered the B9TLs first.</p>

              <p>I think the reason is because prior to this GCM, SBS Transit operated around 75% of the bus routes and SMRT operated around 25%. Hence, SBS Transit is more prone to losing its bus routes than SMRT.</p>
              
              <p>Anyway, it's good for SBS Transit and SMRT to lose bus routes in the current model because the current model cannot make profits without the help of advertising and rental - especially SBS Transit since they own a larger share of the bus routes.</p>

              <p>True but then 291 is already doing a good job with 16 buses. 46 is just a bonus and 46 loading will really depend on which bus arrives first towards Tampines.</p>
              <p>Also at Tampines Interchange, if 46 berth is different from 291, 46 loading will be poor departing from interchange (just like 258).</p>
