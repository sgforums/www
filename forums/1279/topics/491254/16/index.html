              <p>Hi mr array88, sbs 386 is doing very well currently. Crowd is gradually increasing and it is best left untouched. Not practical for it to cover Matilda side as it is on the other end. Note Matilda and edgedale plains are far apart and making it town link will inconvenience many passengers. Punggol interchange is currently being expanded and the workers put up hoardings around the field today. We can expect new services to cover new btos by yr 2016 end earliest or Q1 2017. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3004X, too complex. Think it simple. Don't forget sbs 386 still have a dual function role to play at end of edgefield plains. This makes it even more unlikely. </p>
              <p>Moreover, its current loop does not cover edgedale plains end. So how you expect it to cover all of the side roads around Punggol east then continue back to interchange and go out to cover the side roads of Punggol west??? If you have your eyes on sbs 386, why not do the more sensible stuff of tweaking sbs 382G/W which is Punggol west feeder bus to cover Matilda side? 382G/W are running empty buses so there is scope to modify route to get more passengers. 386 is for east.

              <p>Simply look at how 291 and 293 operate in Tampines, or 911, 912 and 913 in Woodlands.</p>
              <p>What I was saying is to operate 386 like this:</p>
              <p>Punggol Int - Punggol East (via current route) - Punggol Int - Punggol West (to Matilda) - Punggol Int - ...... - (terminate at interchange after a few cycles of this)</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, I understand your point but it will not happen seriously when sbs 382G/W is underperforming. Moreover, Punggol has LRT west and east which somehow takes care of what you wish. Tampines and woodlands have no LRT so need bus services to compliment as town link type. </p>
              <p>Another point in contention is sbs 386 did not cover edgedale plains end. This point was brought into discussion and still unresolved by your so called town link service Sbs 386. It is impractical to use sbs 386 to cover every single road in west and east. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS3004X, so which bus service will cover edgedale plains end (near waterway side after Punggol drive)? This is not answered by the town link service which was proposed. </p>
              <p>Sbs 382G/W serves sumang walk. This is very near to the Matilda side. Sbs 382G/W could just have an additional bus stop towards the punggol field end and better serves all the HDB flats nearby. Take a good look at the map. Sbs 382G/W is much better placed and have the capacity in terms of buses to serve the population there in time to come. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs2656X, you missed the gist ot the issue. Busanalyser asked if any service to connect Matilda and edgedale plains end. 2 other forumers suggest to make sbs 386 town link to link up Matilda and current sbs 386 route, forgetting that edgedale plains end deep inside waterway (after punggol drive) is not part of the sbs 386 route. That is the point. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
