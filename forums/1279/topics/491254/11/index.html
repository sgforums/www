              <p><br> My take on 49:</p>
              <p>Theoretically, a direct service from Jurong East to Taman Jurong
              is necessary and ought to happen, given the developments at Jurong
              East (shopping malls, hospitals etc) and more diverse
              transport options (NSL, future CRL/JRL) rather than a single
              Lakeside MRT.</p>
              <p>But strangely, loading on 49 failed to pick up even during
              weekends (when I expected more people to be shopping at Jurong East
              before taking 49 back home). Possible reasons:</p>
              <p>(1) Winding route at Boon Lay Way, and as a result it can take
              10 minutes from interchange to Jurong Town Hall Rd</p>
              <p>(2) Residents are still used to taking MRT to Lakeside, or
              shopping at Boon Lay instead before taking 30/154 back</p>
              <p>(3) Residents not familiar with the route</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>49 loading was expected to be better but guess people prefer Boon Lay to Jurong East as main hub. 30 is still seen full from Corporation to Boon Lay both AM/PM peak while 49 has a dismissal 20-30 pax loading only. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS6465E, once sengkang interchange expansion is completed in Q4 2016. It will have new services. Maybe they will have new bus services on day of opening of sengkang extension just like what they do to CBP and sbs 47/117.</p>
              <p>As for upper east coast terminal, don't think it can take in another 2 services. Eunos no more as the Eunos services (Sbs 76 and 150) are just implemented in Q1 2016. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi dupdup77, if I am not mistaken UEC is currently being expanded or will be expanded in the future at the very least. As for Eunos, there should be space given that 150 will probably only operate with a measly 4 buses. It can definitely fit another short or medium-haul service. Even so there are alternatives to in the areas I have suggested such as Sims Pl (rumoured to have a new 137 service) and CBP (alternative to UEC). My list is not so much which interchanges/terminals will have new services, but the general areas that will see new services. </p>

              <p>If only there could be a new bus interchange / terminal in Marina South to house some of these services. It would ease the pressure from Shenton Way / Marina Centre / New Bridge Rd / Harbourfront, can be the start/end point for many express routes on the east / northeast via KPE or ECP (such as 513), and can also potentially be a splitting point for some of the terribly long routes (such as 61, 196).</p>

              <p>I agree. Not only that, they need to further decentralize bus services. We need more Marine Parade/Terrace, Taman Jurong and Sims Place Terminals, not more increasingly overcrowded (with sizes that are getting smaller) interchanges.</p>

              <p>Sadly, Marine Parade's unlikely to happen in the short term, with no plans of any terminals, along with the upcoming (?) TEL plans, alignment works and construction. Best thing that can be achieved is to extend some existing UEC services to CBP, then move some of the looping Marine Parade services to UEC where applicable.</p>

              <p>76 deserves to be amended. The service is way too long. It is living hell for Marine Terr residents, having to wait for that sole svc that takes forever to arrive. Its already poor freq, coupled with frequent bunching and delays makes 76 a torture to wait for. Ending at Eunos also gives it a terminating point in the East, reducing bunching for inbound commuters. A nice bold move by LTA this time. </p>

              <p>The amendment I am talking about here is the simplifying and re-routing of routes to enhance reliability. </p>
              <p>The logic is simple. The more winding your route (i.e. more stops, more traffic lights), the more your route is prone to delays and bunches. Eventually those nearer to the other end suffers. Thats what happened to svcs like 2<span style="line-height: 1.231;">4. </span></p>
              <p>And I support moves to solve that problem. Nuff said.</p>

              <div>If LTA shortened 76 just because of its reliability as a long
              looping service, there are thousands of better amendments they
              should look into.</div>
              <div><br> 55, 135, 155: Simply build a roadside terminal at Siglap.<br> 62: Simply terminate at Lor 1 Geylang. If not enough space, extend
              141 to Eunos - in this way 141 will help 21 A LOT.<br> 64: Extend to Buona Vista. Introduce new service for Mei Ling St
              sector.<br>
              <div>70M, 107M, 111, 162M: Maybe extend to Shenton Way via
              MBS? Can do Suntec in both directions<br></div>
              </div>
              <div>81, 82: Best candidates for Bidadari.<br></div>
              <div>51, 61, 67: Not loop services but long enough to take some
              actions.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Sorry for spamming, but I just realised that changes have been
              made to a lot of former long looping routes (124, 123, 103, 99, 76
              etc), and hence I'm kind of expecting more.<br></div>

              <p>Not a popular opinion here, but honestly I feel it is good to have an end terminal for super long looping services. It definitely improves reliability. While I hate that 76 is cut short as I use this service frequently for years to go to Parkway Parade, I think it is a good move.</p>
              <p>76 at Eunos will improve reliability (though my personal preference was Lor 1 rather than Eunos). </p>
              <p>As you pointed out, reliability on 99, 103, 123, 124 has definitely improved with having terminating points at both end.</p>
              <p>I do hope that in due course 62 also gets a terminating point and 51, 61, 67, 961 are split as today no one takes end to end or even more than half the route of these services. They are unreliable in terms of frequency due to long nature of route.</p>
