              <p>I see that nuance goes to die on this forum.</p>
              <p>CDS etc is all ok. Long bus routes that are not winding or serve
              niche markets with poor/inconvenient MRT coverage like TPE or
              CCK/Boon Lay just to name a few, are all ok. </p>
              <p>I have said that long and winding routes should be re-looked at
              as our rail network becomes more mature. Nobody takes them from
              end-to-end. After all, once TEL and CCL6 comes online, 10, 12, 14,
              16, 30, 32, 36, 48, 196, 197 will all heavily duplicate the Marine
              Parade/Mountbatten - City/Pasir Panjang sector. These are all long
              routes that we all know have reliability issues etc. We cannot
              amend all of them, but we should at least look at how we can
              consolidate some of these services and re-deploy the fleet so that
              the area can adapt to the MRT by having more feeders for
              example. </p>
              <p>Parallel MRT services are ok but when you try to replicate the
              same scale and capacity of the MRT as is the case with the buses in
              BPJ/BTM, it is a complete waste of resources. Yes, breakdowns do
              occur. So you're going to keep all the current services in BTM just
              for those 5/365 days a year when a major breakdown
              occurs? </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Also, as I have said MANY
              times. Marine Parade has too many long-distance services not enough
              short-distance services that connect nearby estates. Long-distance
              services have crowded out the area. That is why LTA is reluctant to
              introduce new services due to duplication along Marine Parade Rd.
              Something needs to be done. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">And I can dispute your London
              and Tokyo examples. While routes parallel the Tube/Subway, routes
              are much shorter and cleaner. Not so messy like the ones we have
              here. </span></p>

              <p>Expressway services can remain as supplementary to our MRT network. </p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm not here to advocate slaying all
              long-distance routes.</span></strong> We must strike the
              correct balance to ensure that we optimise our bus and rail
              resources. Don't forget, buses while cheaper to acquire in the
              short-run, have lower capacity and in the long-run are more
              labor-intensive and pollutive.  So, we need the MRT for high
              capacity corridors. Buses should then augment our MRT network by
              covering last-mile sectors and filling in inter-town gaps that
              cannot be served by our MRT or that would be inconvenient to use
              the MRT. We cannot maintain a bus network parallel and of
              equivalent scale to the MRT just for the sake of those few unlucky
              days when breakdowns occur. That is a huge waste of
              resources. </span></p>
              <p>Services like 25 &amp; 854 are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">direct high-frequency
              services</span></strong> that tightly duplicate each other to form
              an almost MRT-like service between Bedok, Eunos, AMK &amp; Yishun.
              Expressway services are all fine.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am against long and winding
              routes</span></strong> like many of the ones in the East where it
              is clear that demand is not constant throughout the route. This is
              a legacy in the East because it was where most of the population
              lived in the 50s, 60s &amp; 70s. So many routes are long and
              winding because there was no MRT, and it was an unscrupolous way
              for all these small-time bus companies to maximise profits by
              packing as many people onto the bus before it would reach
              town. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we
              are living in a different era</span></strong> and we still
              have many of the remnants of this bus network in the East. So it is
              just ridiculous when Marine Parade has all of these connections to
              AMK, YCK, TPY, Bishan, Bukit Merah, when there is no or limited
              access to nearby estates like Chai Chee, Sims Place, Geylang East
              Central, Kembangan, Chai Chee, etc. </p>
              <p>That is why LTA is slowly trying to rationalise this by
              eliminating duplicating long-distance services in order to free up
              space to introduce inter-town routes. With the TEL less than a
              decade away, it is high time LTA starts to think about
              this. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You mentioned the MRT
              rationalisation excercise in the 90s. It was a mistake, period. We
              have ended up with routes that are too long. Who is going to take
              14 from Bedok Road to Bukit Merah? Who is going to take 51 from
              Hougang Central to Queenstown? These are routes that amalgamate
              many demand sectors and thus cannot serve each sector properly
              bacause we all know that longer routes suffer from reliability
              issues. That's why all BSEP routes have been under
              22km. </span></p>

              <p>I feel that the current fare system for Express/Fast Forward services also needs to be improved before any more Express/Fast Forward services are implemented.</p>
              <p>Currently, Express/Fast Forward services do not accept concession passes and adult/senior citizen monthly travel passes. For instance, an adult commuter using a monthly travel pass may not see the motivation to switch from the MRT or trunk services to an Express/Fast Forward service because one mode accepts monthly travel passes (i.e. MRT/trunk services) while the other mode does not (i.e. Express/Fast Forward services). Thus, in order to switch to these services, commuters using monthly travel passes will have to top up extra amounts on top of the prices they are already paying for their monthly travel passes just to use these services, which is not a very viable way of managing monthly transport expenditures.</p>
              <p>Hence, Express/Fast Forward services are currently only beneficial to particular groups of commuters (i.e. students, senior citizens and adults who opt to pay their regular fares and not use concession/monthly travel passes). This could be one reason that impedes the introduction of more of such services or the conversion of existing peak hour Express/Fast Forward services to full day operations.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the LTA should also extend the usage of concession/monthly travel passes to Express/Fast Forward services. This will ensure that commuters who use these passes will not need to increase their monthly transport expenses just to use these services. This could also help in increasing the demands for these services and thereafter see a much greater need to introduce more of these services or convert some existing services to full day services.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm not here to advocate slaying all
              long-distance routes.</span></strong> We must strike the
              correct balance to ensure that we optimise our bus and rail
              resources. Don't forget, buses while cheaper to acquire in the
              short-run, have lower capacity and in the long-run are more
              labor-intensive and pollutive.  So, we need the MRT for high
              capacity corridors. Buses should then augment our MRT network by
              covering last-mile sectors and filling in inter-town gaps that
              cannot be served by our MRT or that would be inconvenient to use
              the MRT. We cannot maintain a bus network parallel and of
              equivalent scale to the MRT just for the sake of those few unlucky
              days when breakdowns occur. That is a huge waste of
              resources. </span></p>
              <p>Services like 25 &amp; 854 are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">direct high-frequency
              services</span></strong> that tightly duplicate each other to form
              an almost MRT-like service between Bedok, Eunos, AMK &amp; Yishun.
              Expressway services are all fine.  <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am against long and winding
              routes</span></strong> like many of the ones in the East where it
              is clear that demand is not constant throughout the route. This is
              a legacy in the East because it was where most of the population
              lived in the 50s, 60s &amp; 70s. So many routes are long and
              winding because there was no MRT, and it was an unscrupolous way
              for all these small-time bus companies to maximise profits by
              packing as many people onto the bus before it would reach
              town. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we
              are living in a different era</span></strong> and we still
              have many of the remnants of this bus network in the East. So it is
              just ridiculous when Marine Parade has all of these connections to
              AMK, YCK, TPY, Bishan, Bukit Merah, when there is no or limited
              access to nearby estates like Chai Chee, Sims Place, Geylang East
              Central, Kembangan, Chai Chee, etc. </p>
              <p>That is why LTA is slowly trying to rationalise this by
              eliminating duplicating long-distance services in order to free up
              space to introduce inter-town routes. With the TEL less than a
              decade away, it is high time LTA starts to think about
              this. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You mentioned the MRT
              rationalisation excercise in the 90s. It was a mistake, period. We
              have ended up with routes that are too long. Who is going to take
              14 from Bedok Road to Bukit Merah? Who is going to take 51 from
              Hougang Central to Queenstown? These are routes that amalgamate
              many demand sectors and thus cannot serve each sector properly
              bacause we all know that longer routes suffer from reliability
              issues. That's why all BSEP routes have been under
              22km. </span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Agreed that the mergers of 14/92 and 51/192 are not the best amendments to come out of the MRT rationalization of the 1980s and that no one will take 14/51 from their starting points to their end points. The rail network certainly offers much faster solutions, as well as a combination of other trunk buses such as 7 (from Bedok to Clementi) or 74/52 (from Hougang Central to Jurong East).</p>
              <p>Another thing I observe of most long-distance services that exist today are that they run from 1 residential town in the North/Central/East, <strong>pass through the CBD </strong>to another residential town in the West,<strong> </strong>which could be the most significant reason why they are even long distance in the first place. Therefore, a faster connection between residential estates that are far apart can definitely be better served by the MRT or a trunk/Express service that don't pass through the CBD. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">74 is a classic example, providing a viable connection from Central to West (Ang Mo Kio to Clementi) using Lornie/Adam Rds to provide faster links than the MRT, had it not been pulled away from Clementi to Buona Vista in the 1990s. </span></p>
              <p>On the other hand, 81 (before NEL rationalization) and 171 are exceptions, detouring around the Northeast (for 81) from the East and Northwest (for 171) from the North before entering the CBD. Therefore, the shortening of 81 during NEL rationalization and suggestions that 171 should be shortened to terminate/loop in the Northwest are more or less justifiable.</p>
              <p>It's good to see that some CBD services in history had indeed been pulled out of CBD to cut down on their long distances. 1 example is 165, which was pulled out of CBD to use Lornie/Adam Rds during the 1974 rationalization. However, for existing long-distance services, splitting them up would probably be a better solution, but I won't go on further given the many suggestions over here and until we can think of better solutions to reorganize these long-haul services.</p>
              <p>With regards to Marine Parade not having connections to other nearby residential estates such as Chai Chee, Sims Place, Geylang East Central and Kembangan, I will comment on each individually:</p>
              <p><strong>- Chai Chee: </strong>16, 196, 197, with 16 being a faster option for residential blocks along the sectors of Marine Parade Rd west of Siglap Rd. Though they do not directly connect to Chai Chee Estate, the estate itself is only a short walk away from Bedok Int. Moreover, I think that Marine Parade residents will prefer going to Bedok Town Centre than Chai Chee Estate, which has more amenities and facilities that the residents would require.<br><strong>- Sims Place: </strong>The upcoming 134 will do that so I will reserve my comments.<br><strong>- Geylang East Central: </strong>155, though not directly with only 1 stop along Victoria Sch. Agreed that this connection could be beefed up, and the upcoming 134 will also do just that so I will once again reserve my comments.<br><strong>- Kembangan: </strong>I will follow Acx1688's sentiments on this one that they previously approved for the operation of such a connection but yet didn't implement it.</p>

              <p>On the efficient deployment of buses, LTA has stubbornly stuck to the 10 min rule no matter if the service has commuters or not, that is killing bus operations, pollution and staffing matters.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there are too many buses laying over/parking at BT/Int during peak hours. Jump bus shld be practiced. Look at SG bus interchanges/ters during peak ...</p>
              <p>Bus Lanes should be full and not truncated for cars to queue up to turn in. If need be, a small section to be opened up for vehicle to turn in to building, service road, etc.</p>
              <p>Bus route scheduling should be readjusted per service according to traffic for efficient fleet deployment</p>
              <p>sv55 has a 120min round trip route which is a luxury while 14, 196 has an approx 100min route which is punishing with the very heavy traffic in city centre.</p>
              <p>Deployment of buses, 966 is overdeployed. Every weekday one can see 966 arriving every 5/6 mins on average(LTA's pride n boasting trump card) provided there is no jam on the expressways BUT downside is 3rd, 4th , 5th bus en route is less than half full. SWT(as discussed in other threads while back) would be productive. In addition, 15, 966 doing 10min layover at Marine Parade would do wonders</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I feel that the current fare system for Express/Fast Forward
              services also needs to be improved before any more Express/Fast
              Forward services are implemented.</p>
              <p>Currently, Express/Fast Forward services do not accept
              concession passes and adult/senior citizen monthly travel passes.
              For instance, an adult commuter using a monthly travel pass may not
              see the motivation to switch from the MRT or trunk services to an
              Express/Fast Forward service because one mode accepts monthly
              travel passes (i.e. MRT/trunk services) while the other mode does
              not (i.e. Express/Fast Forward services). Thus, in order to switch
              to these services, commuters using monthly travel passes will have
              to top up extra amounts on top of the prices they are already
              paying for their monthly travel passes just to use these services,
              which is not a very viable way of managing monthly transport
              expenditures.</p>
              <p>Hence, Express/Fast Forward services are currently only
              beneficial to particular groups of commuters (i.e. students, senior
              citizens and adults who opt to pay their regular fares and not use
              concession/monthly travel passes). This could be one reason that
              impedes the introduction of more of such services or the conversion
              of existing peak hour Express/Fast Forward services to full day
              operations.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the LTA should also extend the usage of
              concession/monthly travel passes to Express/Fast Forward services.
              This will ensure that commuters who use these passes will not need
              to increase their monthly transport expenses just to use these
              services. This could also help in increasing the demands for these
              services and thereafter see a much greater need to introduce more
              of these services or convert some existing services to full day
              services.</p>

              <p>Could you name these sectors. Because other than KJE/SLE sectors (between CCK &amp; Boon Lay/Joo Koon or AMK &amp; BPJ), I cannot see any areas that could potentially have expressway services. PIE, CTE &amp; AYE can have quite heavy traffic during peak hours so I using the train will still be much quicker. Direct services between Punggol &amp; CCK as some have called for I don't think will justify demand. Highway services can be very fleet-intensive, so ensuring sufficient loading to defray the high cost of operating such services must be there. Some have been calling for a direct TPY-Paya Lebar service via PIE. Can be done but again, traffic. 28 usually flies through Bartley. 26 also quite quick. Toa Payoh West residents can use Caldecott MRT. I agree though that Toa Payoh East/Potong Pasir - Paya Lebar is quite out of the way. </p>

              <p>For Hong Kong's case, buses that use e expressway to get from
              residential to urban kowloon, 269B, 16 , etc at Trunk fares.</p>
              <p>5xx series is expensive. 23, 52, 190, 966, 985 eg use
              expressways but at trunk fares. It should be this way so ridership
              can increase for 506, 518(poor ridership at certain times morning,
              518 esp).</p>
              <p>10, 12, 14, 16, 30, 32, 36, 48, 196, 197 after adjustments n
              BSEP injection reduced punctuality issues. Capacity wise would be
              36,48 during peak. I have been looking at M Parade/Katong area
              bus services for years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than tt, traffic holds up adjust every bus service in the
              world...</p>
              <p>Slicing the above mentioned services is UNLIKELY, if tts e case
              70, 80 would be gone after CCL open.</p>
              <p>ffw services (exception of 74e/151e) is to cater to the working
              population(10e,14e,30e, 97e,196e, 854e) while e oth 2 r to rip off
              students... SBST can just introduce 74S as a special departure for
              students. HK, UK does it for schools.</p>
              <p>UK wise, London to be exact has routes that are close to
              underground... </p>
              <p>73( Victoria &gt; Stoke Newington)</p>

              <p>Not all have received BSEP adds. You would have much better results if you simply sliced these services in half. After all, there is very uneven loading because they pass through the CBP. For instance during morning peak hours, on one side you have city-bound commuters, and then buses run empty once leaving the city. Sadly there is not enough space in the CBD. Could be achieved by building underground ITHs in Marina Bay &amp; Orchard Boulevard then selling air-rights on top. There is land in these areas for new high-rise developments. </p>

              <p>On the efficient deployment of buses, LTA has stubbornly stuck
              to the 10 min rule no matter if the service has commuters or not,
              that is killing bus operations, pollution and staffing matters.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there are too many buses laying over/parking at BT/Int
              during peak hours. Jump bus shld be practiced. Look at SG bus
              interchanges/ters during peak ...</p>
              <p>Bus Lanes should be full and not truncated for cars to queue up
              to turn in. If need be, a small section to be opened up for vehicle
              to turn in to building, service road, etc.</p>
              <p>Bus route scheduling should be readjusted per service according
              to traffic for efficient fleet deployment</p>
              <p>sv55 has a 120min round trip route which is a luxury while 14,
              196 has an approx 100min route which is punishing with the very
              heavy traffic in city centre.</p>
              <p>Deployment of buses, 966 is overdeployed. Every weekday one can
              see 966 arriving every 5/6 mins on average(LTA's pride n boasting
              trump card) provided there is no jam on the expressways BUT
              downside is 3rd, 4th , 5th bus en route is less than half full.
              SWT(as discussed in other threads while back) would be productive.
              In addition, 15, 966 doing 10min layover at Marine Parade would do
              wonders</p>

              <p>They could possibly build a terminal at the slip road to Brooke Road by widening the street. It would be side parking like Sims Pl. </p>
              <p>As for Siglap Rd, you could also have side-parking if you eliminated the lots for heavy vehicles at Siglap Link. Side parking again, but sufficient for 55 &amp; 155. 135 can be extended to Eunos. </p>

              <p>Could you name these sectors. Because other than KJE/SLE sectors
              (between CCK &amp; Boon Lay/Joo Koon or AMK &amp; BPJ), I cannot
              see any areas that could potentially have expressway services. PIE,
              CTE &amp; AYE can have quite heavy traffic during peak hours so I
              using the train will still be much quicker. Direct services between
              Punggol &amp; CCK as some have called for I don't think will
              justify demand. Highway services can be very fleet-intensive, so
              ensuring sufficient loading to defray the high cost of operating
              such services must be there. Some have been calling for a direct

              <p>Another thing I observe of most long-distance services that
              exist today are that they run from 1 residential town in the
              North/Central/East, <strong>pass through the CBD</strong> to
              another residential town in the West,<strong> </strong>which
              could be the most significant reason why they are even long
              distance in the first place. Therefore, a faster connection between
              residential estates that are far apart can definitely be better
              served by the MRT or a trunk/Express service that don't pass
              through the CBD. <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">74 is a
              classic example, providing a viable connection from Central to West
              (Ang Mo Kio to Clementi) using Lornie/Adam Rds to provide faster
              links than the MRT, had it not been pulled away from Clementi to
              Buona Vista in the 1990s. </span></p>
              <p>With regards to Marine Parade not having connections to other
              nearby residential estates such as Chai Chee, Sims Place, Geylang
              East Central and Kembangan, I will comment on each
              individually:</p>
              <p><strong>- Chai Chee:</strong> 16, 196, 197, with 16 being a
              faster option for residential blocks along the sectors of Marine
              Parade Rd west of Siglap Rd. Though they do not directly connect to
              Chai Chee Estate, the estate itself is only a short walk away from
              Bedok Int. Moreover, I think that Marine Parade residents will
              prefer going to Bedok Town Centre than Chai Chee Estate, which has
              more amenities and facilities that the residents would
              require.<br> <strong>- Sims Place:</strong> The upcoming 134 will do that so I
              will reserve my comments.<br> <strong>- Geylang East Central:</strong> 155, though not directly
              with only 1 stop along Victoria Sch. Agreed that this connection
              could be beefed up, and the upcoming 134 will also do just that so
              I will once again reserve my comments.<br> <strong>- Kembangan:</strong> I will follow Acx1688's sentiments on
              this one that they previously approved for the operation of such a
              connection but yet didn't implement it.</p>

              <p>Yes, these East/Northeast to West services are prone to many reliability issues due to punishing traffic in the city centre and very uneven loading. </p>
              <p>It's not so much Marine Parade residents using amenities in Chai Chee/Kembangan but the other way round. Marine Parade is home to very reputable schools namely VS, VJC, KC (Pri &amp; Sec), St. Patrick's, Ngee Ann Pri &amp; Tao Nan. You have other amenities also like Mendaki, St. Andrew's Autism Ctr, superb facilities at Marine Parade CC, access to East Coast Park via multiple underpasses and shopping/offices at Parkway Parade. Also, many new developments at Katong are coming up.</p>
              <p>In the future, with TEL, serving Marine Parade will allow for quick access to the Marina South area once developed, and may also relieve loading on EWL by giving residents an alternative. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The parts closer to Bedok ITH and New Upp Changi are alright. The former can walk to Bedok Int and the latter can utilise 32 &amp; 40, though this will only get you to limited points west of Siglap Rd as one has to walk from East Coast Rd. Parts that are deep inside like Chai Chee St are very poorly served. Taking 222 up to Bedok Int and then switiching is a very round-about way. </span></p>
              <p>Same with Kembangan. Taking 42 to Flamingo Valley and then 40 down is just retarded. For 42, you have the loop in and out of Fidelio St plus 40 does not serve Marine Parade Rd directly. 42's frequency is now ok but 40 is not fantastic. Super time consuming and inconvenient. </p>

              <p>Chai Chee Estate is served with 2 feeders. 222 frequency has been beefed up with 4 additional buses + PPSS. There is no need for 229 which is winding for Bedok South residents to Bedok ITH.</p>

                      come. </p>

              <p>Firstly, I am not LTA. I appreciate your passion though. </p>
              <p>Cause of jams are debatable. Sometimes they are caused by the influx of heavy vehicles like on the AYE. However, I agree that public transport is still not an attractive means for some people who commute very long distances. Unfortunately, our planners did not have the foresight for express MRT services like in NYC or Tokyo. CRL will change things. Some still drive because our trains are very crowded. Again, poor planning on LTA's part. But in the East &amp; North, DTL &amp; TEL will hopefully relieve the crowding on EWL/NSL. CDS is a good response. </p>
              <p>Sometimes it is just down to status consciousness among Singaporeans. </p>
              <p>Have you traveled on AYE/PIE or CTE during peak hours? I used to commute daily between Kent Ridge and the East. Hands down train was fastest. So what if it's jam free off-peak. Our trains are emptier off-peak as well. </p>
              <p>161 &amp; 118 can work because TPE is still quite jam free. Please check fleet deployments for other services and reliability as well. 506 can be really bad. </p>
              <p>Right now Punggol is still largely residential. URA's masterplan sets a 10-15 year timeline and with the state of the economy it may slow down. By then you will have CRL. If not an express service of some sort could be implemented once SIT is built. CCK will have Jurong Lake District first anyway. This can be reached by a combination of EWL &amp; NEL. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Right now, you are linking 2 satelite estates that are very far apart where amenities are largely duplicated in both regions. </span></p>

              <p>Chai Chee Estate is served with 2 feeders. 222 frequency has
              been beefed up with 4 additional buses + PPSS. There is no need for
              229 which is winding for Bedok South residents to Bedok ITH.</p>
              <p>What Chai Chee needs is a trunk service and not two feeders.
              Hence, I proposed that 26 be extended to CBP or UEC (latter if 45
              is diverted to CBP). 26 this way would connect Chai Chee to Paya
              Lebar (CCL), Eunos/Kembangan and Tanah Merah.</p>
              <p>Modifying sv 26 route will not inconvenience people and will
              also help revive its loading (today it is just treated as back up
              service with meagre 14 SDs).<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>Supported. Quite a direct route also, so even though route becomes more lengthy reliability should still be ok. </p>
