              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the last statement 'already so many buses
              empty in Punggol...add one more...crazy' is inappropriate.</p>
              <p>The buses are somehow empty due to the inappropiate type which
              is used. DD used for SD loading services which is the
              cause. </p>
              <p>Need address this root cause instead of using a wrong type of
              reason to deny other areas which currently lack a service and slam
              all areas together. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, also need to take into account the route that it will use to reach Punggol east (waterway side). </p>
              <p>Moreover, flats are coming up. One condo riverparc (main entrance facing Punggol drive and side door facing Punggol east) has been built for years. Too bad it is a condo thus number of people taking the buses are not that much. </p>
              <p>Note normally a new service will be launched just 1-2 months before the BTO starts for key collection. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>76 shouldn't have been cut, indeed. Might have been more bearable if 43 was modified to Eunos, and 76 extended to UEC.</p>
              <p>189 (whether former or current route) shouldn't merge with 95, seeing that they serve entirely different groups of people. Better for 95 and 96 to merge instead.</p>

              <p>Not disagreeing 382G/W should have been launched but a year later. In the meantime, they should have diverted a low loading trunk like 117 or 119 till further developments. Once developments up, then they can reinstate 117 or 119 back to original route and then launch 382G/W.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am an economics person. My way of thinking is a bit different, and I accept it. Cheers. You don't need to reply and continue the argument :) I accept your point.</p>

              <p>189 (whether former or current route) shouldn't merge with 95,
              seeing that they serve entirely different groups of people. Better
              for 95 and 96 to merge instead.</p>

              <p>Nor 43 IMO as it caters further down to Siglap, UEC and many people from Paya Lebar take it as a direct bus during peak hours.</p>
              <p>135 cut would still have been okay because I haven't seen many pax taking 135 through and through b/w Marine Parade and Macpherson estate. There would be few who would have to transfer at Paya Lebar to 43/76 but both are/were DD services. Or take 40 (a bit longer but direct, and parallel to MP).</p>

              <p>Last heard is in Jan 2017. So I won't expect the withdrawal of 700/700A or the shortening of 171 so soon.</p>
