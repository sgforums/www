              <p>I find 143 hard to be cut in reality.</p>
              <p>There's demand from West Coast all the way to Orchard, so for
              the West Coast stretch you cannot simply cut it short at
              HarbourFront or Chinatown. There's also no proper terminal near
              Orchard area.</p>
              <p>Unless they want to completely remove the link from West Coast
              to Orchard (175 cannot really replace 143), which will cause even
              more unhappiness than 76.</p>

              <p>The PTOs can ownself introduce short-working/supplementary trips, right? Like recently SBS introduced 181M. I think the only condition is that they must get approval from PTC for the permission to operate the bus service.</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly, a few years ago, one "BSEP" new bus service was introduced using SBS own resources, not government-funded resources. I think it's bus service 4 at tampines...</p>

              <p>Nonetheless, under the GCM where all assets are owned by the government, I think the new comers are not able to ownself create their own bus service, because everything is government owned, not owned by them. So, yeah, cannot.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes you are right. New Bto flats does not automatically equal new bus services if the surrounding areas have too many bus services already. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>The PTOs can ownself introduce short-working/supplementary
              trips, right? Like recently SBS introduced 181M. I think the only
              condition is that they must get approval from PTC for the
              permission to operate the bus service.</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly, a few years ago, one "BSEP" new bus
              service was introduced using SBS own resources, not
              government-funded resources. I think it's bus service 4 at
              tampines...</p>
              <p>as long as got PTC approval, I think the PTOs are able to create
              their own bus service using their own resources.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, under the GCM where all assets are owned by the
              government, I think the new comers are not able to ownself create
              their own bus service, because everything is government owned, not
              owned by them. So, yeah, cannot.</p>

              <p>Technically there are still route amendments etc under SBST/SMRT even after BSEP as launched, such as 123 &amp; 124 to HarbourFront, 189 to Clementi Ave 1, 92M, 181M, 99 to Joo Koon and most JIS amendments (except 258). However I think most of them should be initiated by LTA, with exceptions such as 92M and 181M.</p>
              <p>There were rumors that 20 was supposed to be a non-BSEP service, although it turned out to be BSEP in the end.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, 181M doesn't seem to be a really well utilised
              SWT considering it only operates at AM peak, instead, I feel that
              it should revise its operating hours as follows:</p>
              <p>6:30am-8am, 1pm-3pm, 5:30pm-7:15pm instead or convert it into
              something similar to 70M/133M/700A where 181M can operate on
              weekdays until like 7 or 8pm before operating as 181 with no
              operation on weekends and school holidays.</p>
              <p>I believe this service will help the students as it gives them a
              second bus that stops at their school for their convenience, but
              the operating hours really needs to be extended as the service
              seems to be solely used to cater for the students to go to school
              during AM peak.</p>
              <p>Also, it may cause confusion for some commuters who wait for the
              bus at bus stop 27461 Opp Blk 276B as they are used to waiting at
              that bus stop for 181 but now they need to cross to the other side
              of the road as 181 does not operate during specific timing during
              AM peak.</p>
              <p>Off topic: I'm curious if they will print 181M destos for the
              batch 2 VO3X upon commencing operation of 181M.</p>

                  <p>There is even a banner created for 181M, hung somewhere opposite Gek Poh Ville Community Centre. What do you think? I think there will be 181M destos - although it would only be used for around one hour on every school day - since bus services like 98M and 182M also have destos.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6853S, very unlikely even in future because they have already introduced 2 other services (SBS 134 and 150) into marine terrace. Not possible to have 3 services sbs 76, 134 and 150 all go to marine terrace unless they amend sbs 150 and divert it to other places. In all extenuating circumstances, it is still very unlikely. Wish you good luck and all the very best. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>what to do? 70% voted for this leh. tell you la, if really have inconvenience, next week the MPS sure got a lot of residents go there complain to their MP about it one, while those elderly in RC sure complain among themselves and tell the RC manager about it one. Then the MPs (and RC managers) will feedback to the LTA, and then maybe then they will revert back to 76 current route (until today). otherwise, it means actually everyone's generally okay with it, so there's actually no need to change back.</div>

              <p>tmr 76 will start terminating at eunos already.</p>
              <p>Im afraid they would touch Sv 24 and end it at Eunos as well but
              if they really do so that means LTA is not focusing on reliability
              already as 24 is very reliable even though it is a super long loop
              service.</p>
              <p>If they cut 858 i wouldnt be surprised</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, they will not allow all 3 services 76/134/150 all to loop at marine terraces. This is excessive waste of resources. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
