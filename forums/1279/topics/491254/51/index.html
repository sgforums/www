              <p>Come on - there is MRT to take you faster between Yishun and Sembawang. Alternately, there is also 856, 858, 859. Not enough?</p>

              <p>Do you see how many people actually take 117 between Yishun &amp; Sembawang and vice versa? Many people use this service especially in the afternoon. Even if its 10 pax, its what some people have been looking for</p>
              <p>Not all people take the MRT as the bus stop is in front of Northpoint. You know that the underpass can be fairly long</p>
              <p>Have you seen that Blk 589D has previously no bus to Yishun before 117? Residents here have been wanting this service and now they often ride it to Yishun</p>
              <p>Yes, you have 856 nearby. But I dont think the residents want to since its a long walk to them since some of them are elderly too. In addition, 117 reaches your destination faster than walking to the MRT when the bus stop is in front of you and it is also a semi express service towards Yishun</p>
              <p>What about those people from the mosque every Friday too? There are at least 15 pax who board the bus as it is also a generally fast way to get to the mosque. Not all people do want to go to the mosque in SEM, you know</p>

              <p>the problem here is stop pushing people to take mrt. not all the place is reachable by train. also look at circle line every morning so many people. I wonder if LTA can look for other way of transport other than train. to get to a place faster. </p>
              <p>What i thinking is base on the bus service LTA spend a bit of money by drawing full day bus lane at those places where high demand for public transport whether is for train or bus service. force cars to give way to buses along the way. and also bulid overhead bus lane at key junctions. We not need another MRT lines. just semi BRT might help out.</p>
              <p>Now we have electric bus on trial maybe as well perpare a good transport plan both bus and train.  </p>

              <p>it is just an additional 1km detour....  the travel time wont add so much...maybe 5-10 mins? </p>
              <p>further, it will benefit the residents at the new canberra flats for them to have direct link to yishun, rather than have to take feeders or walk out to the main roads..... </p>

              <p>Hi mr smb1368T, from the way I see it, LTA will not re-route service 117 to pass through other parts of sembawang. The way the route is current structured can tell that it is all along main roads and directly connected to sembawang bus interchange and MRT in the fastest possible manner. Counting the number of stops it goes in to Canberra link and sembawang way will make all realize this. Yes, I agree Canberra link blk 589D needs it. Moreover, it is a trunk service to connect Punggol to yishun and sembawang. So no need to worry about detractors who will always want to route into those new flats around Canberra areas. That will definitely be planned for new routes and most likely feeder services first and later on new trunks. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>To lemon1974,</p>
              <p>the problem is that not many people will live there from this year onwards. You cant expect a major service to serve a small community. That is why 42 is the only bus in Kembangan as the population is small. Furthermore, you have 883 which is going to SEM MRT too where you have more connections from there which other services can still tank the load</p>
              <p>I am sure more services will go there once its fully developed</p>

              <p>Easy. Because that one is a different case. 131 still can duplicate the old 21 route. It is not possible to make a new route as the new route would have duplicate 21 as well. Since 21 has DDs to carry so it is of no problem since people want to go to Novena anyway</p>
              <p>117 DDs are anyway will still be kept to get ready for new developments along the route along the way such as at Seletar</p>
              <p>Even now its a waste for DDs to ply Canberra when Canberra is only starting to grow. St Micheal's is already a much developed area in which more people live here than Canberra</p>

              <p>Lets not be so rigid. It is just a suggestion which will benefit more people. At the end of the day, LTA can always introduce new services.</p>
              <p>So your logic is that there should be a new service for the one BTO rather than have existing service that is having extremely low loading in that area to be diverted.</p>
              <p>So have 2 low loading services and waste more resources.</p>
              <p>Well LTA is okay with that but where my opinion is concerned, I don't quite like this strategy of wasting resources.</p>
              <p>Rather introduce new service when more flats are up and occupancy increases.</p>
