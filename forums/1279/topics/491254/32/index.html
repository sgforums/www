              <p>Dont compare 902 and other feeder like services. 902 served students who are young u got see meh elderly people take 902? I havent seen one in my 3 yrs of RP life even till nw.</p>
              <p>I stated the only exception that people would want to take that bus with legitimate reason is heavy bag, alot of stuff to carry. Otherwise most of the students are plain lazy to walk that 1km to RP. I know coz i did that before and it wasnt efficient for me.</p>
              <p>I also think it is a waste of resource but still got demand to serve some minority of students who legitimately could not walk to school and also some lazy people too.</p>
              <p>Other feeder like services served residential area with elderly who are physically able to walk from 1 bus stop to another like most of us here.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, you cannot fault the students. Distance is 1.1km which deems necessary to have this smrt 902. Anything more than 1 bus stop length of 500 metres is termed not within walking distance. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>LOL 1.1km is considered near for an average physically able student. If elderly i can understand. If u realize the proportion of students walking to RP is very high compared to students waiting for 902. 902 is a just a svc for convenience for students. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB585L, I understand the point where you are coming from. However to the authorities, they view as not within walking distance. Over the past year, they even introduced other services to connect directly to educational institutions and schools. Straight to doorstep. One example is the introduction of 181M to benefit students from one school. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

                      <p>If that's the case, then how come they never introduce 185M or something for Singapore Poly students, in particularly those at Hilltop and FC1 area?</p>
                      <p>Have been wanting to suggest a new bus route at Singapore Polytechnic, but after surveying the roads, it is quite hard. Most roads are in one direction. The main traffic is from Dover Road side. SPACE and Hilltop road traffic flow is against each other. How to have a single bus route there? :(</p>
                      
                      <p>Polytechnic students are at least 15 years old - teenagers. I am sure walking is not an issue for most of them. The only problem is whether they can rush to class, connect to school wifi and submit ATS by 8:15am, if they arrive at Dover MRT at around 8:05am/8:10am. But this cannot be solved by having buses at SP.</p>
                  
                  <p>Speaking of which, I have 8am class tomorrow. I have to sleep now. Good night.</p>
              <p>This week is week 5. MST is in week 7. Unfortunately, GCM happens to start at the week when I have MST. Where got time to try riding on Tower Transit bus services? :(</p>

              <p>Have been wanting to suggest a new bus route at Singapore
              Polytechnic, but after surveying the roads, it is quite hard. Most
              roads are in one direction. The main traffic is from Dover Road
              side. SPACE and Hilltop road traffic flow is against each other.
              How to have a single bus route there? :(</p>
              <p>Polytechnic students are at least 15 years old - teenagers. I am
              sure walking is not an issue for most of them. The only problem is
              whether they can rush to class, connect to school wifi and submit
              ATS by 8:15am, if they arrive at Dover MRT at around 8:05am/8:10am.
              But this cannot be solved by having buses at SP.</p>
              <p>Speaking of which, I have 8am class tomorrow. I have to sleep
              now. Good night.</p>

              <p>A new bus route could be 23, should 23 be amended to Dover after DTL2/3 rationalisation. Speaking about that, people will be taking DTL than 23, so it does not hurt commuters, even though there is Rochor, Jalan Besar, Little India, Farrer Park and Bendemeer stations.</p>

                  <p>Speaking of Downtown Line, Beauty World and King Albert Park stations are not near to Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Nonetheless, it does provide an alternative to Clementi and Dover MRT Stations, for students of Ngee Ann Poly who live in areas along the line.</p>

              <p>ah yeah now no need to up and down escalators. but the problem is the small traffic triangle. this is never a problem of buses but the school timetable. every weekday morning except on non RP days, many of the RP students will cross the junction between Riverside Road, Woodlands Avenue 2, 5 and 9. however there is a overhead bridge in front of RPC. now is compounded by the Thomson Line constructions and some other works.</p>
