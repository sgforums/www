              <p>No way that 858 would be amended. I am a resident of Sembawang and many living in this area use the route to get to SSC/Chong Pang/Northpoint and most importantly Yishun Poly. It might be infrequent at times, but we still rely on the route as it is the only route to get to Yishun Poly from here, unless if LTA thinks that the route ought to be amended, we dont bother walking down to Sembawang MRT as 117 is there (with the exception of 859/859A/859B) and many of us living here are young people as long as there is a link to Yishun Poly</p>

              <p>24 is reliable??!!</p>
              <p>Coming from a daily commuter of 24 in its eastern stretch I can tell you it is the contrary.</p>
              <p>24 should consider skipping certain sectors of its route, to shorten its travel time while retaining its full route. CGA svcs also desperately need a terminating point. It's time. </p>

              <p>Technically there are still route amendments etc under SBST/SMRT
              even after BSEP as launched, such as 123 &amp; 124 to HarbourFront,
              189 to Clementi Ave 1, 92M, 181M, 99 to Joo Koon and most JIS

              initiated by LTA, with exceptions such as 92M and 181M.</p>
              <p>There were rumors that 20 was supposed to be a non-BSEP service,

              <p>Not a rumour bro; it was a FACT. </p>
              <p>SBST press release clearly stated a non-BSEP svc from Tampines to CBP would be intro. Thats why I was truly surprised when I saw 20 under BSEP.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, surprisingly Eunos bus interchange seems to be ultra quiet. Not many passengers at all. Wondered why? Lack of a major mall? Bus interchange next to eunos MRT yet crowd is even lesser than that of Punggol or sengkang interchange. Other bus interchanges are short of berths yet eunos has so many extra not used. Before adding 76 and 150 to eunos, there are 5 empty passengers boarding berth/queues. After adding, still got 3 more extra queuing berths. Hope sbs 76 amendment to eunos will bring more load to eunos area. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Eunos has never been a crowded place. It might be the only multi-modal interchange in Singapore, other than HarbourFront and Joo Koon, that is not built in a town centre.</p>

              <p>Eunos is not the right location for interchange. Paya Lebar should have had a bus interchange instead. There are no amenities near Eunos. Most are at Geylang Serai, Tanjong Katong, Paya Lebar. </p>

              <p>Paya Lebar isn't that pressing. The one place that really needs the interchange is Marine Parade, where there is little space to accomodate one.</p>
              <p>But this got me thinking: would it make logical or financial sense to convert the carpark near East Coast Park BBQ pits 7-12 (area C) to a multi-storey carpark, merging with the nearby one at Parkland Green, then set aside the ground floor for buses? That would make a small but functional bus terminal. The walls facing the beach can double up with soundproof barriers to minimise noise pollution for beach visitors.</p>
              <p>After which, simply modify Marine Parade Flyover a little for departing buses to turn left into Still Rd South. Voila! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi mr Yusry, yes I know. I stay in singapore since born. I have been to changi/geylang road, geylang serai market, joo Chiat complex, city plaza and many other areas. I feel that the town centre lacked a major mall by capitaland or Fraser centre point. Further down is the marine parade and east coast cluster which is more lively. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, eunos serves as an intermediate place between paya Lebar and bedok. It has this space and it can be used as a gateway to marine parade, east coast cluster. After taking sbs 150 today, I fully understand why it is introduced from eunos to marine terrace loop. Before sbs 150 is introduced, telok Kurau road only has sbs 15 and 155. Some parts of telok Kurau only have sbs 15. Both sbs 150 and sbs 155 are looping services which make the frequency an issue. BSEP is supposed to provide roads with 1 or 2 bus services with more choices. Thus sbs 150 is here to supplement this. Nearest interchange is eunos which should help out 15/155. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
