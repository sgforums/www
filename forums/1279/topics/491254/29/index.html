              <p>Wow... exactly the route I had proposed Q1 this year... and it was shot down by my friends here saying 983 will cover and no new feeder required as CCK does not have space.</p>
              <p>CCK really does not have space, but what I have realized is that if LTA wants to introduce service it does whether interchange has space or not. I just don't know how they manage to squeeze so many more buses into those overly crowded interchanges. </p>
              <p>My route used CCK Central (where 307 plies)... this one uses CCK Dr... But does ave 1&amp;7, CCK Grove and Keat Hong Link as I had mentioned. </p>
              <p>Good route!</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, I think sengkang new services will not come before July 2016. The current interchange is also undergoing renovation. Sections of it are being cordoned off. So unlikely new services will be introduced. Expected completion date is end July 2016. They are also repairing the airconditioner inside the sengkang bus interchange. This interchange is famous for its super hot Aircon which has not been working since the initial days. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Wow... exactly the route I had proposed Q1 this year... and it
                  was shot down by my friends here saying 983 will cover and no new
                  feeder required as CCK does not have space.</p>
              <p>CCK really does not have space, but what I have realized is that
                  if LTA wants to introduce service it does whether interchange has
                  space or not. I just don't know how they manage to squeeze so many
                  more buses into those overly crowded interchanges. </p>
              <p>My route used CCK Central (where 307 plies)... this one uses CCK
                  Dr... But does ave 1&amp;7, CCK Grove and Keat Hong Link as I had
                  mentioned. </p>
              <p>Good route!</p>

              <p>Would it be feasible if 983 reversed it routes, instead of starting from CCK to BPJ, it can start from BPJ to CCK loop? Relieving space at CCK int</p>

                                          <p>Boon Lay has 22 end-on parking lots and 38 sawtooth parking lots.</p>
                                      
                                      <p>Over at Changi Business Park Bus Terminal, the berths are all end-on type. 1 bus route is allocated 3 end-on parking lots, probably to ensure smooth traffic flow. Based on that, I would assume that the end-on section at Boon Lay Bus Interchange is only able to accomodate up to 7 bus routes, since there are 22 parking lots.</p>
                                      
                                       <p>As for the sawtooth section, 1 bus route probably needs only 2 parking lots, since the boarding and alighting activities are done at separate bays. With 38 parking lots at the sawtooth section of Boon Lay Bus Interchange, it is likely that up to 19 bus routes can park there.</p>
                                          
                                             <p>Hence, I assume that 7 routes at end-on and 19 routes at sawtooth is the maximum number there can be at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, if we want to have smooth traffic flow. The maximum number of bus routes that can originate at Boon Lay Bus Interchange is probably 26.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Well, there are currently 25 bus routes originating at Boon Lay Bus Interchange (if include route 79, it is 26), after 4 were transfered to Joo Koon last year. Of the 25 bus routes, 9 routes are at the end-on section (including route 79, it's 10.) and 16 routes are at the sawtooth section.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>Clearly, the end-on section is over-utilised by 3 routes and the sawtooth section is under-utilised by 3 routes. So, obviously, the traffic flow is bad at the end-on section, and good at the sawtooth section.</p>
                                          
                                          <p>To improve the traffic flow at the end-on section, I would like to recommend moving route 79 and two other routes from the end-on section to the sawtooth section.</p>
                                  
                                   <p>We can change route 79 to really loop at Boon Lay Bus Interchange and not give it any parking lots at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, since it loops at Boon Lay. This would make 2 parking lots available at the sawtooth section of Boon Lay Bus Interchange and allow for 1 new bus route to originate at Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
                              
                              <p>So, to answer your question, yes, there is space at Boon Lay, but for only 1 more bus route to originate there. If want more at Boon Lay, the additional routes can only loop there.</p>

              <p>By right, if we want to have smooth traffic flow at Boon Lay
              during peak hours, the maximum number of bus routes we can have is
              23. This is because Boon Lay has 22 end-on parking lots and 38
              sawtooth parking lots.</p>
              <p>Based on Changi Business Park Bus Terminal, where one bus route
              is allocated three end-on parking lots, the end-on section at Boon
              Lay is actually only able to accomodate up to 7 bus routes. As for
              the sawtooth section, since the boarding and alighting activities
              are done at separate bays, up to 16 bus routes can be accomodated
              there.</p>
              <p>Yet, there are 26 bus routes at Boon Lay - 10 at end-on, 16 at
              sawtooth. (Including bus route 79, since it occupies two parking
              lots at the end-on section.) No wonder there is still jam at the
              end-on section during peak periods.</p>
              <p>In order to achieve smooth traffic flow during peak hours, we
              have to move 3 routes from end-on to sawtooth and transfer 2 routes
              out of Boon Lay.</p>
              <p>Here, I would like to recommend transferring 193 and 256 out of
              Boon Lay. We can split 193 at Joo Koon, with one originating at Joo
              Koon and looping at Boon Lay, and the other originating at Tuas and
              looping at Joo Koon. We can change 256 to originate at Joo Koon and
              loop at Boon Lay. Currently, Joo Koon has 7 bus routes; can
              accommodate 2 more. We can let 256 and "half of" 193 take up the 2
              vacancies at Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the movement of bus routes from end-on to sawtooth
              at Boon Lay, I would like to nominate 79, 249 and 252. 79 because
              it loops at Boon Lay. 249 and 252 because they do not travel out of
              Jurong region.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to answer your question, yes, Boon Lay does not have
              space. Even with what I recommend above, the capacity at Boon Lay
              is only just nice. There is actually no space for a new bus route
              at Boon Lay.</p>

              <p>You must consider the feeder and short trunk service that have high frequencies which actively enter the bus interchanges...Service like 157 ought to have 3 lots to be on safe side..Doesnt mean they look like 24 service you die2 must have 24 service unless its all trunk service.Changi Business Park only can accomodate 4 service the maximum...47 is a loop service and everytime i saw 3 svc 47 buses already at the lots..</p>

              <p>Changi Village got 22 parking lots excluding the 2 reserved lots..If they need more service they have to built a proper alighting berth maybe just 70m in front of the boardinh berth..Else every buses will stuck there...I agreed that CV can have 2 more service the max.</p>

              <p>I doubt that Tuas Bus Terminal will have new bus services. Tuas Bus Terminal is so far from civilisation, I do not think it is wise to operate a bus interchange or terminal there. When the new bus terminal opens, it is likely that operations at the existing bus terminal will close, instead of relocate. Bus routes 192 and 193 may be changed to loop at Tuas and then return to Boon Lay, or Joo Koon.</p>
                      
                      <p>The purpose of the new bus terminal at Tuas MRT depot is probably to relieve traffic flow at Jurong East Bus Interchange, instead of replace the existing Tuas Bus Terminal. It is probably for the Malaysia cross-boarder routes CW3, CW4, CW6, and international bus routes to park their buses only, and use Tuas Link MRT Station as their pick-up and drop-off points. Since they are from Malaysia, they will save on petrol as they do not have to go all the way to Jurong East.</p>
              
              
              <p>As for our Singapore buses, what can we save by having a bus hub at Tuas? We will only lose money lor. So what for? Might as well consolidate everything within Jurong area. Jurong area still can, since got Soon Lee depot and Bulim depot. But if go further west, may not be wise.</p>
              
              <p>So, yeah, if got new bus service at Tuas, it's likely that it may not originate at Tuas Bus Terminal, but instead it may originate from somewhere else around Jurong area and loop at Tuas. That's what I think, though I may be wrong.</p>
