              <p>Seriously, why can't LTA just think of SLIGHTLY better routes than 150? When there are thousands of ways to solve problems without shortening 76 or without having yet another clone of 13/15/155.</p>
              <p>I cannot think of any reason for this other than political interest. But again, not sure if they will be happy with the loss of 76.</p>

              <p>Apparently, those services introduced at the end of the year are usually the better ones. 2014 saw introduction of 201, 35, 140 and 2015 saw 117, 117, 983.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>To be real, route planning by LTA had already gone downhill since the late 1990s when they conducted the Woodlands MRT Rationalization by removing 950/952 which could have served as good alternatives to the MRT right now for Woodlands residents heading to the CBD. It's true that at least they reinstated both in the form of 960, but the detour around Woodlands Rd and Bukit Panjang would have slowed down the journey for Woodlands residents and the MRT ended up being the fastest option between Woodlands and CBD. The removal of TIBS 182 was understandable given that it takes a long way to CBD (similar to 171 now) and heavily duplicates 181 (aka current 961) as well.</p>
              <p>Then came the Bukit Panjang LRT Rationalization on 26 Dec 1999, where they removed 179, 344 &amp; 345 without considering that some residential blocks in Bukit Panjang that were served by these services may be of some distance away from the new LRT stations. Moreover, 179 would have also served as a good backup service when the BPLRT experienced many service disruptions during its earlier years of operation. It took them three months to realize that whatever they did was too drastic and introduced 920 to replace part of 344/345's old routes. The withdrawal of 5 and introduction of 970 is already over discussed here so I'll save it.</p>
              <p>Then came the even more horrendous NEL Rationalization in 2003, which has also been over discussed here as well so I'll leave it at this.</p>
              <p>The Hougang South Int amendments in 2004 were also not really well planned. 328's extension to Serangoon as 101 is not exactly a bad thing, but is duplicative of 81, 82, 107/107M and 153. No comments for 112. 113's detour around Hougang Ave 8/6/10/2 would have been unnecessary if they had amended 62 to serve Kovan MRT and its frequency, again over discussed here, no need to say more.</p>
              <p>Since you do not like long distance services, extending 51 further up from Hougang South to Central isn't exactly the best idea and also resulted in lost links between Kovan MRT and Hougang Ave 3, which people had to complain for a not-so-economical 115 to be introduced 8 months later. 132's diversion northwards to Hougang Central also saw lost links between Ang Mo Kio and Kovan (136 takes slightly longer than 132 to provide that connection due to its detour via Serangoon Gardens). 151's extension to Hougang Central is the only one I feel that was fine.</p>
              <p>After seeing all these screwed up rationalizations and route amendments from the past, expecting better services isn't really something very realistic at this point, but rather something that you can only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wish</span></strong> for.

              <p>To be real, route planning by LTA had already gone downhill since the late 1990s when they conducted the Woodlands MRT Rationalization by removing 950/952 which could have served as good alternatives to the MRT right now for Woodlands residents heading to the CBD. It's true that at least they reinstated both in the form of 960, but the detour around Woodlands Rd and Bukit Panjang would have slowed down the journey for Woodlands residents and the MRT ended up being the fastest option between Woodlands and CBD. The removal of TIBS 182 was understandable given that it takes a long way to CBD (similar to 171 now) and heavily duplicates 181 (aka current 961) as well.</p>
              <p>Then came the Bukit Panjang LRT Rationalization on 26 Dec 1999, where they removed 179, 344 &amp; 345 without considering that some residential blocks in Bukit Panjang that were served by these services may be of some distance away from the new LRT stations. Moreover, 179 would have also served as a good backup service when the BPLRT experienced many service disruptions during its earlier years of operation. It took them three months to realize that whatever they did was too drastic and introduced 920 to replace part of 344/345's old routes. The withdrawal of 5 and introduction of 970 is already over discussed here so I'll save it.</p>

              <p>Now 101 at Serangoon does help to take residents to CCL and NEX, and you can often see long queues even at Serangoon Int. But I understand that was not the case in 2004.</p>
