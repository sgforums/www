              <p>How many from MT will actually take the svc beyond PP and PL,
                  realistically speaking? And 134 does the exact same job too. Only a
                  small minority will have to transfer and wait, even if so in a
                  common well-sheltered bus stop. For the rest it's just far more
                  reliable waiting times. </p>
              <p>And sorry hor, not everyone could walk okay. Maybe those staying
                  near the big road will prob go ahead without 76/134, but majority
                  of MT ppl stay deeper in, and definitely a bus at the doorstep
                  could help. Furthermore, quite a large part of the residents
                  comprise of elderly. Have you thought about them?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You are quite right, the elderly/some pax really depend on 76 at marine terr to board incl piw. Even tho the freq can go up to 15 mins or so during off peak.</p>
              <p>And they even made silver zones for the elderly along marine terr/cres due to it, however I still dont get it that why must they make two lanes into one and the single lane is too narrow.</p>
              <p>There is a bottle neck in the morning along the two areas due to the schools nearby some sections of the road should not merge into one lane.</p>
              <p>However, still not much publicity of the new 134/76/150 on buses and bus shelters.</p>
              <p>But I still feel that from opposite Parkway parade the freqs of both 196/76 could be better managed on weekdays, always end up 196/76 end up together and the next 196 or 76 comes in 10 minutes or so. 134 could improve the bus bunching between 196/76 that often happens, have a feeling 134 will help on that.</p>

              <p>Sorry proposal is to extend 150 to Parkway Parade as current route is too short to be of any good. </p>
              <p>15 going direct would provide alternative to 966 to PP / Eunos with DDs.</p>

              <p>If only there could be a new bus interchange / terminal in
              Marina South to house some of these services. It would ease the
              pressure from Shenton Way / Marina Centre / New Bridge Rd /
              Harbourfront, can be the start/end point for many express routes on
              the east / northeast via KPE or ECP (such as 513), and can also
              potentially be a splitting point for some of the terribly long

              <p>Are you referring to the future Marina South ITH? Route 857 should be given first priority for this one. Other services can include 23, 62 &amp; 970. 120-122 can relocate there too.</p>
              <p>Route 23: Tampines-Marina South (with variant 23A doing the current loop at Rochor Canal). From Jln Besar, use Bencoolen St, Middle Rd, North/South Bridge Rds, Upp Pickering St, Church St and Marina Blvd.</p>
              <p>Route 62: Punggol-Marina South. From Geylang Rd, use Kallang Rd, Crawford St, Republic Ave/Blvd and Bayfront Ave.</p>
              <p>Route 857: Yishun-Marina South. From Temasek Ave, use Bayfront Ave.</p>
              <p>Route 970: Bukit Panjang-Marina South. From Church St, use Marina Blvd.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS7557R, sbs 62 was extended from upper serangoon to Punggol bus interchange on 1 end and the other end was shortened from new bridge terminal to loop at lorong 1 geylang during the NEL rationalisation. They did that because the distance was too long after extending to Punggol. So they shortened the other end after finding where is the best looping point. In the end, that point is lorong 1 geylang which is on thr fringe of city. This also kills off Punggol link to city effectively. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>15 can't really be amended because it would eliminate a connection between PP and Telok Kurau. Extending 150 to PP is also not an option as it will not serve Marine Terrace. Yes, doing a red/white plate is doable but I think it would make traveling time for Telok Kurau residents a bit long, and I think LTA generally does not want to upset connections to nearby amenities. Quite frankly, the solution for Marine Terrace &lt;&gt; Eunos sector is simply to get 55 to loop around Marine Terrace. Then introduce a new service between Eunos - Still Rd - Marine Parade - Lengkong Tiga/Empat or Chai Chee. </p>

              <p>Hi Mr Dudup77, I don't quite get your logic. If the route was a bi-directional NBR-Punggol service, it would be much shorter than its current routing (longer overall but D1/D2 would be shorter). If route length was such an issue, why didn't LTA simply cut it to Lor 1 Geylang when the terminal still had space at that point in time. Having a long loop service versus two D1/D2 is always much better for reliability and fleet management. </p>

              <p>I think for 2's case, is to modernise and housekeep the route meant for their future generations like my generation, think 'cannot be done' due to YourStudent era.</p>
              <p>Some routes are always kept with significant demand through, or transferred to other replicative services.</p>
              <p>For 62, I doubt it is because no way can escape to Bugis, Clarke Quay &amp; Chinatown. All are connected by the DTL and NEL, all are spoonfeeded. Maybe should be moved over to terminate at Downtown MRT Station, to provide 'little' connectivity.</p>
              <p>The NEL-duplicative routes are not needed to just go back to the old terminus like the former Path Light saying. what we want is to go to what is only needed: Little India, Tampines, or Punggol Northshore.</p>
              <p>old 3 was cancelled due to the MRT line (Bedok - Jurong East) and may be extended to Tampines.</p>
              <p>147 took over the service 2 at first, but other than that service 147 has always not been removed in 2003. Service 81, 82, 85, 97, 103, 106, 111, 501, 502, 511 and 512 - all these are withdrawn or rerouted away because either there is a drop in demand due to NEL opening, the contracts were about to expire until 1 January 2005 and so they have to make changes or it could be a long waiting time.</p>

              <p>Or we could easily add buses to that service...? Why is route duplication always the solution? The paradox of choice?</p>

              <p>I think for 2's case, is to modernise and housekeep the route
              meant for their future generations like my generation, think
              'cannot be done' due to YourStudent era.</p>
              <p>Some routes are always kept with significant demand through, or
              transferred to other replicative services.</p>
              <p>For 62, I doubt it is because no way can escape to Bugis, Clarke
              Quay &amp; Chinatown. All are connected by the DTL and NEL, all are
              spoonfeeded. Maybe should be moved over to terminate at Downtown
              MRT Station, to provide 'little' connectivity.</p>
              <p>The NEL-duplicative routes are not needed to just go back to the
              old terminus like the former Path Light saying. what we want is to
              go to what is only needed: Little India, Tampines, or Punggol
              Northshore.</p>
              <p>old 3 was cancelled due to the MRT line (Bedok - Jurong East)
              and may be extended to Tampines.</p>
              <p>147 took over the service 2 at first, but other than that
              service 147 has always not been removed in 2003. Service 81, 82,
              85, 97, 103, 106, 111, 501, 502, 511 and 512 - all these are
              withdrawn or rerouted away because either there is a drop in demand
              due to NEL opening, the contracts were about to expire until 1
              January 2005 and so they have to make changes or it could be a long
              waiting time.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Tidying up of services, retaining heavily-demanded sectors and skipping the rest, or reducing stops along those stretches. </p>
              <p>Or we could always inplement the Orchard Road model to all major roads in Singapore!</p>
