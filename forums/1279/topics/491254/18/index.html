              joined LTA's Policy and Planning Group 4.5 years ago out of his

              <p>2. He has delved into bus photography, bus spotting, advert
              spotting etc. in his younger days.</p>
              <p>3. He outlined various phases in route planning - understanding
              commuters' travelling patterns and needs, field investigation,
              resource allocation for new routes, how to connect key nodes
              etc.</p>
              <p>4. Has spent the past 4 years (seriously?!) shortening/amending
              Sv 76, which will cease to loop at Marine Terr this coming 20th Mar
              to become a bi-directional service.</p>
              <p>5. He derives job satisfaction from providing greater
              convenience to commuters. (Ok... I can't seem to see how cutting Sv
              76 and making people alight and wait for Sv 134 is really more
              convenient just to solve the reliability issues of long loop
              service. As many on the forums have said, there are other avenues
              to alleviate the long headways at the looping end.)</p>
              <p>6. Ever since he joined LTA, he has been explaining to friends
              and relatives the constraints and unfavourable road conditions that
              bus services are subject to. Has also been taking feedback and
              recommendations from them.</p>
              <p>7. Lastly, he said that resource allocation are based on needs.
              (Not much surprise here, though it's hard to explain the excesses
              of Sv 120/121/122, Sv 102/324 and Sv 150's duplication with Sv
              13/15/155/966.)</p>

              <p>Hi mr simply.90, this goes to show that one should not mix hobby with job. Not every person should do this. End up make many passengers unhappy. Now even have petition for sbs 76 to retain old route. Cheers. Thanks.Â </p>

              Spent 4 years cutting sv 76?, siao ah?
              Even a primary 1 kid can do better than this.
              Cutting off sv 76 just for the sake of reliability issue. Like that I can anyhow cut sv 147, 196, 143 etc. bodoh!

              <p>Whenever there is a change, there is bound to be a reaction. People are averse to changes. I am hearing two things.</p>
              <p>1. People are happy that 134 is introduced as Marine Terrace residents are guaranteed more regular buses and frequency as 76 was notorious for bunching and getting late. Many times two buses arrive but after 20-25 mins with 2nd bus usually returning empty all the way back. People along Paya Lebar road who go to AMK, sv 76 is their best choice. When 76 reaches Marine Terrace at odd frequencies of 20 mins, you can imagine this getting worse at Paya Lebar sector. Also those along AMK Ave 4 who go to YCK MRT, sv 76 can really be very late at times. Terminating at Eunos can improve reliability. Hence, there are many users of 76 who welcome this decision.Â </p>
              <p>2. There is a small population of Marine Terrace residents who go beyond Paya Lebar MRT. It is actually really small and I can say these are not old people. They will need to transfer at Paya Lebar MRT to hordes of other service like sv 43. These are the people who will be shouting right now.</p>
              <p>Many people here on the forum live in Punggol and other areas and don't take sv 76 and are complaining. Not sure how many of these complaints are legitimate or driven by popularism given that this amendment is not going to cause huge inconvenience. So lets relax and let time take its own course. If people still don't like it sv 76 can be amended back.Â </p>
