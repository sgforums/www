              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>With regards to the whole saga about taking part of the route of
              Service 76 off and replacing it with a new Service 134 and how bad
              it is, it's definitely a pity to see a direct connection gone for
              the sake of improving the overall efficiency of the service due to
              its long route.</p>
              <p>However, I would also like to say that there were route
              amendments, cutbacks and withdrawals way back into the past that
              were worse such as:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">12 December
              1999: </strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Withdrawing
              former Service 864 due to "duplication with sv84" and "minimizing
              duplication", resulting in lost links between the Northeast and
              Marina Centre.</span></li>
              <li><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">26 December
              1999: </strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Withdrawing
              former Service 5 due to its, again, "overly lengthy" route and
              replacing it with Service 970 months later, resulting in lost links
              along Margaret Dr, Lower Delta Rd, Jln Bt Merah and the eastern
              sectors along Hill St and Victoria St.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>27 July
              2003: </strong>Withdrawing former Service 989 due to
              "duplication with the Changi Airport" and that commuters are
              "better served by the MRT to connect to the airport" and replacing
              it with Service 985, which admittedly is a good connection from
              Kallang/Boon Keng to Bukit Batok/Choa Chu Kang, but comes at the
              expense of losing a direct link to Changi Airport.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>27 July
              2003:</strong> Withdrawing former Services 85, 501, 511 and 512 due
              to "extensive duplication with the NEL" and only replacing Service
              85 with Service 119 partially months later, resulting in lost links
              between the Northeast and Orchard/Somerset (Dhoby Ghaut has NEL so
              I won't go on), Shenton Way, Marina Centre, Great World City and
              Tiong Bahru. Cutbacks of Services 106, 111 and 502 to Marina Centre
              from the Northeast to fully oblierate any fast connections between
              the Northeast and Orchard/Somerset.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><strong>7 December
              2003:</strong> Cutback of Service 62 to Lor 1 Geylang, again due to
              "overly lengthy route". What a good excuse to cut up buses
              eh?</span></li>
              </ul>
              <div>While some of the above examples of unjustified bus service
              withdrawals/cutbacks may not be unjustified to some here (maybe the
              old 5 indeed does not have much demand and replacing it with sv970
              is just fine, maybe sv62 is indeed overly lengthy and keeping it
              backwards at Lor 1 Geylang is a much better option after its demand
              to the city is dug away by the NEL), some are certainly agreeable
              to most here (for 85, 111, 501, 502, 511, 512 &amp; 989).
              Therefore, I won't say this cutback of sv76 is not something that
              the LTA may not come up with, given that they can come up with the
              examples above decades back.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Inconvenience wise in terms of the need to transfer to sv134
              or increasing overcrowding on sv43 due to the cutback of sv76, it
              may be significant or not so depending on the individual travel
              needs of the residents. However, I've to say it's not the worst
              cutback to ever be implemented. If the commuters from sv189 are
              able to adapt to using sv201, this transfer to sv134 will have to
              sooner or later be accustomed.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>As I've also mentioned in an earlier post, the best way to
              implement sv134 without affecting sv76 would be to have it replace
              sv150 totally via Telok Kurau Rd. In this way, sv76 is not touched
              and sv134 can continue to be implemented. 1 more service added to
              bring greater convenience to the residents of Marine Terrace.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>And since there are quite a few others here who agree with the
              cutback of sv76 as well to "improve overall service efficiency"
              etc., let's have a look at the list of bus services by route length
              in the earlier post and see what other routes need to be cutback to
              "improve overall service efficiency". And let's see if petitions
              will also start rolling when long distance services like 14, 30,
              51, 61, 154 and 961 get cutback or split into two.</div>
              </div>

              <p>Hi mr Sbs7557R, do you know why Sbs 5 was suddenly withdrawn in yr 1999? It was a damn popular service and there were many passengers. I was one of them. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, don't worry. Sbs 32 and Sbs 122 will be fully choked with people in 5 years time. The whole of Margaret drive and Dawson area are going to be populated when all the new flats are going to be up.  There will also be a new neighbourhood centre with hawker centre next to queenstown Mrt station. The plans are already up in HDB records. Most of the flats are enbloc type. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Oh, by the way, looking at Google Maps I don't think it is feasible for 122 to loop at Queenstown MRT. The most they can do is to make 122 loop at Commonwealth Ave via Dawson Rd - Strathmore Ave - Commonwealth Ave - Alexandra Rd - Dawson Rd.</p>

              <p>32 no choice because you cannot let 32 continue using Margarete

              <p>Maybe one solution would be to let 32 use Dawson Rd and

              <p>21 uses McNair and Towner Rds towards Pasir Ris also nobody complain. Also, 131 plies different routes within Pek Kio estate in both directions. 155 plies Joo Chiat Pl in 1 direction and Changi Rd in the other. 30 only passes through Teban Gdn en route to Boon Lay.</p>

In all, around eleven years is required to acquire, relocate, demolish and build.</p>
                                                                                      <p>Yet, the MRT Jurong Region Line is slated to be ready from 2025; nine years from now. I guess the section to NTU will not be ready until 2027.</p>
                                                                                      <p>Due to the difference of two years between my own speculation (2027) and the timeline set by the authorities (2025), I wonder if the pair of viaduct can be constructed within just two years.</p>
                                                                                      <p>So, I asked the "experts" at the other forum, in the thread on Jurong Region Line. I wrote one main reply to ask about what kind of system the MRT Jurong Region Line may use and how long construction may take, and wrote two random replies both saying "Thanks, y2koh.". Unfortunately, the administrators/moderators there do not like to be complimented, so just because of the "Thanks, y2koh" replies I wrote, I was banned from that forum. The reason they gave is "trolling and spamming". As such, I am not able to write at that forum. So, I am writing it here.</p>
                                                                                  <p>I am sorry for wasting your time having to read this, but since you mentioned about en-bloc/SERS, I feel that maybe I should share with everyone here on some thoughts I have on it.</p>
                                                                              <p>I feel that the next SERS site could be at Jurong West Street 81. As the flats there were built in year 1995 and would only be around twenty-six years old by the time the replacement flats are ready in year 2021, I feel that this is an acquisition rather than a SERS project. Nonetheless, the procedure should be similar to the flats at Rochor Centre that are acquired for North South Expressway and replaced through the SERS programme. In this case, it is acquisition for MRT Jurong Region Line.</p>
                                                                          <p>That said, I feel that there may be another batch of flats in Jurong West Extension being selected for SERS, and have the replacement flats built along with those for blks 859-866. This is because the site at Jurong West Street 24 / Avenue 3 could accommodate around 2,118 replacement units, based on comparasion with the SERS replacement site opposite Jurong Point: "Jurong West Blossom". After we replace the approximately 600 flats at blks 859-866, there is space to replace around 1,518 more flats.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>There are flats in Jurong West Extension town that are built in around year 1985, which I feel we can take this opportunity to give the people living there an upgrade. This can help inject "new blood" into Jurong West Extension, where the last new HDB flats were built in year 2006/7 and the population seems to be aging - such that secondary schools are merging - already.</p>

                      <p>From my observation a few people do use 122 to the
                      amenities (such as food courts) at Commonwealth Dr. Maybe the
                      number will increase with greater population in this area. Although
                      122's extensive duplication with 32 is indeed worrying (but 32 and
                      195's frequencies are not that great also).</p>

                      <p>Queenstown area confirm need some kind of new route, or route re-organisation. SERS  (en-bloc) will cause some population to shift. BTOs will increase population. The number of upcoming BTO units in Queenstown (eg. The ones at Ghim Moh Link) is quite large. I cannot remember how many, but I think around one two thousand. If include the past BTOs, I think there's at least two three thousand already, can really warrant at least one new bus service in Queenstown.</p>

              <p>aiyah young ppl nowadays only know how to complain and complain.. Like this must petition for those bus svcs using north bridge road to call at ICA bus stop (Lavender) or bugis junction as the opp direction does call at Lavender station eg. Sv 7,80,100,51,197 or bugis junction - Sv 7,80,197,133</p>
              <p>Also sooner or later there might be a petition to remove 115 as it is used for the elderly only not many "adults" take this bus svc right?</p>

              <p>Good to hear news about the new bus stops there, but I don't think LTA will amend 139M as it's a supplementary service and most of its stops should be the same as 139 (unless 139 is amended too).</p>
              <p>It could be a new service with 139M's route and amended into Jln Tenteram. 139M can then be withdrawn.</p>

              <p>Good to hear news about the new bus stops there, but I don't
              think LTA will amend 139M as it's a supplementary service and most
              of its stops should be the same as 139 (unless 139 is amended
              too).</p>
              <p>It could be a new service with 139M's route and amended into Jln
              Temteram. 139M can then be withdrawn.</p>

              <p>Supplementary services sometimes ply different routes and bus stops not included in the original route...I consider all 'M' services to be as such, like 181M.</p>

              <p>IMO I would like to categorise supplementary services into 2 types:</p>
              <p>1. Duplicates main service along one particular sector to enhance frequency (17A, 43M, 53M, 63M, 123M, 131M, 139M, 143M, 163M, 170X(sort of), 859A, 859B)</p>
              <p>This kind of supplementary services usually do not call at bus stops not included in their main services. There are some exceptions when supplementary services ply roads without the main service and call at the stops there (43M, 53M, 143M), but that's more like for the service to turn back to original route, and is usually not intended for new catchment areas.</p>
              <p>These services usually operate together with the main service.</p>
              <p>2. Enhances the operation hours of main service, with changes in route to cater to change in demands at different timings (35M, 70M, 92M, 98M(sort of), 107M, 162M, 181M, 182M, 700A, 900A)</p>
              <p>This kind of supplementary services usually operate only when their main service is not in operation (with some exceptions such as 98M). The main reason is that demand at some sectors only come at specific times of the day, so there's no need for a full service to run for the whole day. I consider 181M as such a case also for the abovementioned reasons (just like 900A).</p>
              <p>Therefore, since 139M falls under the first category, I don't think it's possible to specifically divert it into Jln Tenteram where there's no 139, as this will make 139M seem more like the second category but with operating hours same as 139 and purpose similar to 139. Most likely it will be a new service to Jln Tenteram instead which can achieve the same effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tl;dr version: New service to replace 139M seems more likely to me than amending 139M.</p>

              <p><strong>Lets stop making a fuss about 76.</strong> As said
                          residents are benefited more than inconvenienced with 134 providing
                          better reliability.</p>
              <p>76 reliability has been horrible of late. At first when this was
                          announced, I wasn't happy too as I have a sentiment for 76 as I
                          take it often from Paya Lebar MRT to Parkway Parade. But guess what
                          experience has shown me that 76 frequency and bunching is one of
                          the worst.</p>
              <p>I feel pitty for those AMK Ave 4 residents who want to go to YCK
                          MRT and have no choice but 76. If 76 is <strong>20-25 mins</strong> late at Marine Terrace, you can imagine how bad the
                          frequency/bunching can be. It is also the only service connecting
                          Paya Lebar industrial/commercial belt to heavily populated AMK
                          residential zone along ave 3/4. </p>
              <p>LTA is conservative. They wouldn't have done it if there weren't
                          other alternatives. There is 43 all the way till YCK Road/AMK Ave 3
                          junction. I think 43 should get more SD-&gt;DD conversion as well
                          with this move. </p>

              <p>There are a few services I know of which are doing far worse than 76 in terms of reliability. A couple of these services will be going to Tower Transit.</p>
              <p>When I was in Perth for a while, I was forced to make an extra 30 minute transfer when my routes operated by Swan Transit were all cut short to increase reliability.</p>
              <p>I will be very surprised if I don't see at least three trunk routes from Jurong East Interchange getting cut up within the next three years.</p>
              <p>Specifically, there is a substantial risk that routes 51, 66 and 143 may be cut up.</p>

              <p>They don't.</p>
              <p>But they have every right to discuss with LTA which routes are unsustainable to operate in terms of operational reliability. Once they receive the hot potato routes, they will know.</p>
              <p>Route planning in Perth is also done by LTA's equivalent (specifically, Public Transport Authority of Western Australia), in consultation with the incumbent operators.</p>

              <p>I find 143 hard to be cut in reality.</p>
              <p>There's demand from West Coast all the way to Orchard, so for the West Coast stretch you cannot simply cut it short at HarbourFront or Chinatown. There's also no proper terminal near Orchard area.</p>
              <p>Unless they want to completely remove the link from West Coast to Orchard (175 cannot really replace 143), which will cause even more unhappiness than 76.</p>
