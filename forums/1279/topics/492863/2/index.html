              <p>Well of course Mercedes could try to use their Citaro LE, but that seems to have an even steeper slope than what you will find in the fully low floor buses we have here or even the Scania K230UBs.Plus, the seats at the rear are located on an additional platform that has quite a huge step to the aisle, this is on top of the aisle located at the raised floor portion. What this means is that pax will have to climb the 2 steps to the raised floor, and then another large step onto the seats, this huge additional step to the seats may slow things down during boarding or alighting in an already bus that already has two steps to the rear portion, plus the last row is situated very high up. In short, the Citaro LE has lots of steps for pax to navigate than it may seem at first glance.</p>
              <p>Parts commonality wise, the Citaro LE doesn't come in the 6.4l engine which is used in Citaros here, and lastly, there doesn't seem to be a 3 door RHD version of the bus.</p>

              <p>The problem with Voith Citaro that use the 6.4l engine is the delay on the first gear..But again 2nd and 3rd gear make up for the torqueless acceleration..That's what ZF Citaro has an advantage over it.</p>

              <p>IMO if the raised platform is proven to be an inevitable design condition, the tradeoff is actually pretty worth it... Coz anyways it makes little difference for those who are not as physically able when you compare them with taking current LE buses.</p>
              <p>But indeed, it would be good if they can find a workaround... It is an LF chassis after all</p>

              <p>One thing I have to say is that while you know a lot about the industry, you tend to be pessimistic regarding BCM, their operators and bus purchasing under BCM due to your experiences overseas which while some aspects of it are relevant to Singapore's context, the full picture may not be as pessimistic as you think due to the differing cultures and domestic economic realities.</p>

              and bus purchasing under BCM due to your experiences overseas which
              while some aspects of it are relevant to Singapore's context, the
              full picture may not be as pessimistic as you think due to the
              differing cultures and domestic economic realities.</p>

              <p>My friend, maximising profit in the long term is not about maximising prices. This is not how business is conducted unless you are a monopoly (and are certain about it*). Maximising profit in this case can be achieved by having a good product, priced competitively and good working relationship and after sales care so that customers will go back to you for future orders, ie creating a win-win situation for both you and your customer. So I am certain MAN knows how to conduct a business in a similar manner, otherwise they wouldn't be winning an increasing number of orders in the region.</p>
              <p>On a side note, as another example against your maximising profit vs maximising price misconception, though not related and not relevant to this industry, for a price elastic product like fruit juice, you actually would lower your price (without going below cost) to get customers, hence maximising profits by getting more customers. This is basic economics 101.</p>
              <p>*This is a very important point, for an elaboration, see previous post by me.</p>

              <p>Volvo actually has more room for customisation than ADL. Its just that customers in Singapore and HK choose the same body manufacturer for the B9TL. You could fit whatever body that suits your need on the B9TL, but for ADL, you are pretty much stuck with their body.</p>

              <p>Well of course Mercedes could try to use their Citaro LE, but
              that seems to have an even steeper slope than what you will find in
              the fully low floor buses we have here or even the Scania
              K230UBs.Plus, the seats at the rear are located on an additional
              platform that has quite a huge step to the aisle, this is on top of
              the aisle located at the raised floor portion. What this means is
              that pax will have to climb the 2 steps to the raised floor, and
              then another large step onto the seats, this huge additional step
              to the seats may slow things down during boarding or alighting in
              an already bus that already has two steps to the rear portion, plus
              the last row is situated very high up. In short, the Citaro LE has
              lots of steps for pax to navigate than it may seem at first
              glance.</p>
              <p>Parts commonality wise, the Citaro LE doesn't come in the 6.4l
              engine which is used in Citaros here, and lastly, there doesn't
              seem to be a 3 door RHD version of the bus.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, there is no need for 3 doors SD.  Less seatings n the last door won't benefit much ppl.  Ppl seated near the middle door will likely to exit from the middle exit. No of standees at the rear is usually less than 10. N that step is so high.  (Look similar to those private PPSS or CDS buses).  You won't be able to exit fast also because of the high steps</p>
