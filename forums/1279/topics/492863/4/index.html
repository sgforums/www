              <p>I dont think the 12m SD 3 Door trial will be successful. The ratio of seating passengers to standing passengers is too small. One bad thing about bendies was that it's high capacity involves more standing capacity than seating capcity.</p>
              <p>3 Door DD could help improve the efficiency and layover time and also be able to provide more seating capacity so it is kind of best of both world. SO I think this one will succeed. Only down side is the need to go up and come down, which may not be the best for our aging population especially for short distance commutes. But for trunk routes, this bus will be very good to improve passenger flow.</p>
              <p>Feeder best option imo will still be a mix of 18m 3door buses and 12m 2door SD. 12m 3door DD mixed with 12m 2door SD will be next best option.</p>
              <p>For trunks, 12m 3door DD mixed with 12m 2door SD is good. With more MRT connections, i believe DDs can compensate abit of capacity to have an extra staircase to speed up layover times. Eventually Singapore can work towards 3Door DD fleet</p>

              <p>Let me remind you what LTA wants to achieve - BETTER WAITING TIME . What this means is that LTA will tend to favour buses with more doors to let more passengers to disembark more quickly than before . Number of seats ? Yeah they count too but LTA main priority is WAITING TIME . The faster the passenger get out of the bus the faster the bus leaves the bus stop and picks up more passenger . </p>

              <p>Hmm.. That's funny, given how the public were the ones

                  decisions?</p>

                  how the ADL is "unsuitable" and "impractical", and now?</p>

              <p>Instead of giving incentives to driver for meeting a certain
              target of being on time, they extend the journey time. Which makes
              driver drive slowly.</p>
              <p>But imo, the A95 3-door DD isn't ideal yet. More waiting time is
              needed for passengers going down, thanks to the extra gate. Would
              prefer them trying out the ADL 3 door version though..might be
              better than this A95.</p>
