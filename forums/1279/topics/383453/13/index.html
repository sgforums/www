              <p><br>True, but of course they must have more savings and their pay will increase yearly. Subsidy? At least they dun need to pay any maintainace fees and can afford a car.</p>

              <p>Most of the schools in the West are still in decent places like Bukit Timah and Dover, factories wise, yes there are more, but do you see everyone or most people who lived in the East shift to the West? No, cos nobody wants to wake up smelling chocolates or some unknown fume or see some chimney outside the window. The smell is quite stong that even at Jurong West St 75, you can still smell it at times.</p>

              <p><br> I doubt so, tourists will rather take the train too. The crowd in
              the morning and peak is high. Bus is good if u r staying in
              the East but u can't confirm to get a seat now. Jam and
              everything can delay these buses but MRT only delay when
              there are ppl jumping down the tracks.</p>

              <p>I dare say tourist don't take public transport, they take taxi. Most locals take taxis also. And even during peak hour, you can still get a seat on the train.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I dun smell it that often but it really depends on the location you stay. Dun be shocked that u r smelling unknown stuff from Malaysia and Indon when you are in another part of Singapore.  Maybe I am also immuned too. Maybe I also staying in the A/C room. NEA say is safe then is safe lor.</p>

              <p><br>if buses are unreliable, can forget abt talking abt feedering</p>
              <p>if you say unreliable tat means our transport ministers all have failed.</p>
              <p>SMRT is unreliable as well. In Taipei, off peak MRT freq 3 mins e most. here 7 - 8 mins. peak hrs Jurong East is like a mob, gotta tell ppl to refrain from boarding if train is too packed</p>
              <p>I remembered once also, taking 66 from Bt Batok MRT is equally as fast as taking MRT simply cos you've to wait 2 - 3 train before able to board</p>
