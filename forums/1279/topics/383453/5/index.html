              <p>Don't think 246 and 249 will be relocated to Joo Koon Ter but rather services that serves the Jurong Industrial area nearer to Joo Koon MRT like 254, 255, 257 and 182 etc will move over.</p>
              <p>But then when those svcs are relocated to Joo koon Ter those JIS on end on berths which have not been relocated to Joo Koon ter as well as svc 79 might switch to the saw tooth berth and amended to ply Jurong West St 64 (non stop) and Boon Lay Way just like 240. As you have noticed all the svcs from saw tooth turns left from the new int while those on the end on berth turns rights from the interchange for their route.</p>
              <p>In the end things might becomes 30, 154, 157, 174 and 198 taking 4 slots each and 174e taking the remaining 2 slots.</p>

              <p>If you noticed, those ending at End-on berths turn right when exiting, while those ending at sawtooth berth turn left while exiting.</p>

              <p>Eh, thinking about what I've said just now, I actually went by the back alley, the place where you can see the glass panel of McDonalds. If your camera lense is around 24mm, it will be able to fit through the fence and you can have a fun time snapping pictures.</p>
              <p>You can enter via the following spots (if you dare, since those area have a signboard which says: Area Closed, No Access.):</p>
              <p>1. JP2 B1, beside Stalford Learning Centre, escalator leads to JP1 Level 1 Taxi Stand.</p>
              <p>2. JP2 Level 3, The Market Place, escalator outside Fairprice Xtra, leads directly to the interchange.</p>
              <p>3. JP2 Level 1, beside the money exchange.</p>
              <p>4. JP2 Level 1, Lift Lobby, where there is also a entrance to The Centris (residents only) on your right. Infront of you is the door to the interchange.</p>
              <p>5. JP2 Level 1, near the Takeaway Alley.</p>

              Terminal opens. To decrease passenger loading, probably 192 and 193
              will loop at Boon Lay Int instead of terminating at Boon Lay

              <p>Well, you can leave such planning to SBST. About services moving to Joo Koon, this is too early for us to make assumptions.</p>
              <p>You may think it is ridiculous for JIS to terminate at end-on berths. However it is planned this way for safety and traffic flow reasons. That's why 242 405 get amended to serve Jurong West Ctrl 3.</p>
              <p>As for 179/A and 199, other than the crowd, you have to consider the size of the interchange and how many parking lots these 2 services occupies. Making 2-directional services into loop service do not affect much of passenger loading but the main thing is to make space for parking.</p>
              <p>Anyway, isn't 79 a loop service? If it were to retain as loop service and return to sawtooth berths, it should follow 194 240 making a round out of Jurong West Ctrl.</p>

              <p>Don't think 246 and 249 will be relocated to Joo Koon Ter but rather services that serves the Jurong Industrial area nearer to Joo Koon MRT like 254, 255, 257 and 182 etc will move over.</p>
              <p>But then when those svcs are relocated to Joo koon Ter those JIS on end on berths which have not been relocated to Joo Koon ter as well as svc 79 might switch to the saw tooth berth and amended to ply Jurong West St 64 (non stop) and Boon Lay Way just like 240. As you have noticed all the svcs from saw tooth turns left from the new int while those on the end on berth turns rights from the interchange for their route.</p>
              <p>In the end things might becomes 30, 154, 157, 174 and 198 taking 4 slots each and 174e taking the remaining 2 slots.</p>

              <p>If u look at my post earlier on, I was referring to the sawtooth. I knw it is wide, but don't forget that the entrance is a 2 way in &amp; out (obvious). So when u think of it, it's more like a 90 degree turning in, not as bad as the Toa Payoh one. Almost 180 degree turning in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
