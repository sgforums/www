              <p>Ya. </p>
              <p>All they can come up with is just to leave these buses at the temporary interchange and bring them over to the new one when they are confident that they can manage the crowds the moment these buses join in.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's really time that the authorities look into the matter.</p>
              <p>I mean, things can't just continue to be worse right? Something must be done to make this situation better. </p>
              <p>How about the new feeder bus services that may be introduce as Jurong West continues to develop? There will be more and more of it as time develops and soon, there will still be the feared traffic congestions if nothing is done.</p>
              <p>Well, I'm just wondering... is it time to build the long-waited Jurong LRT? </p>
              <p>NTU is still on-going developing and it's student population is still growing...</p>
              <p>Now, these NTU-bond services are already operating at their peaks. Hasn't the authorities realise that? </p>
              <p>Isn't it time to implement the planned LRT system in Jurong West that would go all the way to NTU? </p>
              <p>There are limits on how many passengers a bus and a LRT can take but if you were to compare, a LRT train can ferry more passengers than a doubledecker bus. </p>
              <p>So, do you think the authorities would finally take the LRT plan down the shelves and look into the matter again? </p>

              <p>As for constructing LRT, you will need space. Also if you are to develop an LRT line linking to NTU, be prepared tat Jurong West Extn residents might not benefit (BNL bound during PM Peak esp) much from the comfort and convenience as mentioned over NTU's population. For one thing why I'm against e LRT, SBS can provide downroute for 179 to Sound spine NTU and the LRT might not be able to do so.</p>
              <p>As for Jurong West's development, eventually the Blks 200+ (The Western numbering side) would be developed. SBS might by then also need to develop the bus network there other than 181 &amp; 185.</p>
              <p>From wat I see the whole issue over 241, it sounds as if SBS need to 'pamper' 241.

              <p>well.. for the LRT suggestion, I was just writing down my suggestion which I think might solve the NTU bus congestion issue permanently. LRT need not be the solution to this problem actually..</p>
              <p>if you have been following the news a few years ago(around 2008), the authorities once mentioned that they were looking into other alternative types of transportation like the trams that are used in London and Hong Kong which could be built on the grass patch instead of being on the roads here, beside the roads and the walkways(for the pedestrian's safety, barriers could be put up to prevent any unwanted accidents).. it's cheaper and yet still can ferry more people than a bus(let's not talk about 241 frequency yet...).. besides, the routes can be changed easily (just like changing underground cables except that in this case, it's the tracks).... well, this is also just my suggestion. </p>
              <p>Now, about the 241 issue that you wanted to raise out.</p>
              <p>Hasn't SBS done enough to improve the connectivity in the street 91 area to the extent that now people in the area are connected to Pioneer MRT station too instead of just Boon Lay MRT? </p>
              <p>What's the need to ' pamper' 241 where it is already the shortest route in town and yet have a higher frequency than 179? Personally, I feel that the unnecessary number of fleet deployments on some services is the main factor why there are these problems now..</p>
              <p>I know... there's this thing called the  'bus cross-over' where buses cross over to serve another route..  however, as the nation's population and the passenger volume increases, this is no longer going to solve the problem mann.. </p>
              <p>is it time for SBS to buy even more buses and keep the current fleet instead of selling them away? </p>
              <p>well... perhaps now the only way to fix the issue is simply to build the Joo Koon bus interchange, bring some services over there and thus solve the congestion problem once and for all..</p>
              <p>but then, when is that going to happen? 10 years later when there is a massive uncontrollable human and bus jam in Boon Lay Bus Interchange? </p>
              <p>is the government taking actions towards solving this issue?   </p>

              <p>NTU is not congested, it's the public tpt demand is way too high.</p>
              <p>Tram is not going to work here, we've no space. Look at wat happens to Hong Kong Island CBD area w/ those trams, roads are super narrow.</p>
              <p>As for crossover, simply put, we dun have enough buses to go around (and even so, it takes time to get more drivers) and in any case, the peak demand for 179 &amp; 241 are almost mutually exclusive. Same goes for crossover w/ 255. Barring issues like wet weather, it should not be an problem.</p>
              <p>I'll mention why Temp Joo Koon Int is not viable since ppl keep on asking. Imagine tat small bus stop is made to face w/ crash loading for 182, 251, 254, 255 &amp; 257. Can tat poor small bus stop cope? As for the Perm Hub, there's some info tat I've to resist from disclose here.</p>
