              <p>What's the need to ' pamper' 241 where it is already the shortest route in town and yet have a higher frequency than 179? Personally, I feel that the unnecessary number of fleet deployments on some services is the main factor why there are these problems now..</p>

              <p>Well, that is possible but regarding grateful, I think it is because either they dont know much OR bcoz the 179 / 199 are fully airconed while the industrial estate bus are not. (And given that their working condition could be hot &amp; sweaty on a non-aircon bus, the working adults of course will complain of being uncomfortable, despite, in terms of health, is not good for person who is hot and sweaty directly go to aircon-ed place. Futhermore, neither will the air pollution by the sweats of all passengers will do good for the bus as well)</p>

              <p>The NTU-D is quite limited as in that early days it can't help much. ADDs can't cope, not to say those typical 40 seater. Post 0930 freq reverts to 15 mins while 179 runs at 3 mins freq. NTU-D does not have PM peak freq.</p>
              <p><br>Even so, can 241's demand match w/ 179's more than 20,000 riders a day?</p>
              <p>Demand for 241 has increased, same goes to NTU's annual intake inclusive of evening p-t students.</p>
              <p>If u do not know, thks to BNL's mess future int would cease to feature end on berths. Even so, moving in and out is still tricky.</p>

              <p>The NTU-D is quite limited as in that early days it can't help much. ADDs can't cope, not to say those typical 40 seater. Post 0930 freq reverts to 15 mins while 179 runs at 3 mins freq. NTU-D does not have PM peak freq.</p>
              <p><br>Even so, can 241's demand match w/ 179's more than 20,000 riders a day?</p>
              <p>Demand for 241 has increased, same goes to NTU's annual intake inclusive of evening p-t students.</p>
              <p>If u do not know, thks to BNL's mess future int would cease to feature end on berths. Even so, moving in and out is still tricky.</p>

              <p>Boon Lay is the largest interchange and one of the interchange with the most bus services. With the limited space, end on berth is needed rather than squeezing all the bus services in 1 area. More importantly, it will defintely jam up the entrance and exit of the interchange.</p>
