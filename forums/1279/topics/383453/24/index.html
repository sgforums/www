              <p>u never asked sv99 drivers the reason behind the bunching &amp; flipping plates? it has nothing to do with the schedule.... and flipping plates are no longer the SOP. they're from the early days of AVMS management.</p>
              <p>in any case, why east district has had no problems running jumpbus for so many of its services, even though it seems tougher? are you going to agree that's because they have better coordination? practically the whole of amk and all svcs from yck, just to name a few, they're all on jumpbus for so many years without incident. the bay and fleet savings are just enormous...... do we need another boon lay int (hint: clementi) to get slbp into the act? answer this if u believe you represent slbp and can speak for them...</p>
              <p>you considered jams along sv174 as smooth operation, but not so for sv124. but both are city routes! i'm sure many of us have seen sv174 bunch too! and interestingly most of the buses i took headed to the east and north during the evening peak out of orchard actually do not bunch.</p>
              <p>as for the typo... if u made a mistake i think it'd be mature to admit it instead of brushing it aside. i dunno about your standards but that's mine, and i'm sure SBS9818A would share the same sentiments.</p>

              <p>What happened to the buses are just different driving styles, some drivers like it fast and some drivers like it slow.</p>
              <p>What happens in a jump bus system is that drivers jump to another bus around 10+am after their lunch break, or during dinner around 5+/6+pm, other than that the buses do normal rotation.</p>
