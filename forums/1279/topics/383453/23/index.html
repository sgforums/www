              <p>Service 36 is a very unique jumpbus service, where the headway is entirely controlled by the running time, with an additional 2 minutes of vehicle layover at PTB2 at the end of the trips.

              <p>As for the observation that Service 124 being late, the reason cannot be due to jumpbus, because most drivers do not "jump" to another bus except during mealbreaks, unless the headway is very small.

When there are jams, both face the same problem. Jump bus requires all BC in that fleet to obey closely to the time and it is not easy to do so as load differ at times.

              <p>you mean, if it's not a jumpbus service, they don't have to obey closely? then what are schedules for? load might differ, but running time supplied by the drivers themselves should always be something they can accomplish, with the necessary buffer. if not, why do you think some people feel SBST buses are very slow at times?</p>
              
              <p>i repeat, outside mealbreak timings, when buses don't jump, it works the same as other services, since they don't need the additional lot needed during mealbreaks.</p>
              
              <p>are you the spokesperson for service 174? how sure are you that the operations are smooth? do you have any data of actual &amp; scheduled arrival times at boon lay int from PM peak to close?</p>

              <p>you mean, if it's not a jumpbus service, they don't have to obey closely? then what are schedules for? load might differ, but running time supplied by the drivers themselves should always be something they can accomplish, with the necessary buffer. if not, why do you think some people feel SBST buses are very slow at times?</p>
              <p>i repeat, outside mealbreak timings, when buses don't jump, it works the same as other services, since they don't need the additional lot needed during mealbreaks.</p>
              <p>are you the spokesperson for service 174? how sure are you that the operations are smooth? do you have any data of actual &amp; scheduled arrival times at boon lay int from PM peak to close?</p>

              <p>u never asked sv99 drivers the reason behind the bunching &amp; flipping plates? it has nothing to do with the schedule.... and flipping plates are no longer the SOP. they're from the early days of AVMS management.</p>
              
              <p>in any case, why east district has had no problems running jumpbus for so many of its services, even though it seems tougher? are you going to agree that's because they have better coordination? practically the whole of amk and all svcs from yck, just to name a few, they're all on jumpbus for so many years without incident. the bay and fleet savings are just enormous...... do we need another boon lay int (hint: clementi) to get slbp into the act? answer this if u believe you represent slbp and can speak for them...</p>
              
              <p>you considered jams along sv174 as smooth operation, but not so for sv124. but both are city routes! i'm sure many of us have seen sv174 bunch too! and interestingly most of the buses i took headed to the east and north during the evening peak out of orchard actually do not bunch.</p>
              
              <p>as for the typo... if u made a mistake i think it'd be mature to admit it instead of brushing it aside. i dunno about your standards but that's mine, and i'm sure SBS9818A would share the same sentiments.</p>
