            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, well, well... hmm, 2 days ago, i visited this thread, so far so good. and for now suddenly this thread shoot up to a record of additional 5 pages (now its page 27), wonder what's going on in here.. oh well, chickenlittle2 is on the prowl for the mess of 5 pages, talking non-stop about SLBP is lousy bus blah blah blah and whatever nonsense inside. After reading the last 5 pages of this thread, I was furiously ashamed in what chickenlittle2 had did that troubled some people here.<br><br><strong>The result: </strong>People like 'Scania', 'TIB1232Z' and '^tamago^', etc are joining in a hot pursuit in replying all your utter nonsense - albeit crappy post.<br><br>After reading this thread, I can already tell from chickenlittle2 that he has generally gained a <strong>FUTILE EFFORT</strong> in backing up his points after several of the forum-nites/bus fans had replied and all of his unneccessary replies to people can reveal his IQ or EQ level. So chickenlittle2, do you think that you can just simply gain your futile effort in criticism, point of view or feedback on its bus operations/depots/fleet of buses and after you are being flamed by people, then attempting to suck up the entire issue with your claimed back-up points and go hostile on people thereafter? You can see how <strong>SHAMEFUL </strong>you are by posting in any thread, not only here.<br><br>Without further ado, Time for me to unpack my logic for you, mr chickenlittle2.<br><br>First, If you just think one-sided that SLBP is a lousy bus then imagine you are currently in the Army and your assigned NS enlistment camp is at Pasir Laba Camp and theres 182, 182M and 193 serving the camp, would you avoid it and just take a cab home, and squander the money on cab fares rather than taking any SBS buses (just because you hate and criticise SLBP buses for a moment)? But for the judgement of yours, do you agree that you can just simply bring the SLBP buses to criticism and go on hostile for every SLBP service/buses by avoiding it? If you think that this statement justifies adequately for yourself, go ahead by all means, be my guest and just don't blame me for any consequences.<br><br>Second, after that you said that you wanted to back up your point of view or your wortless information with your friends or whatever. Who knows... I wonder what friend are you talking about? School, Polytechnic, etc?? And his/her name? I was just wondering. Given this scenario, Its just like when you are arrested by the Police or law enforcers after commiting a crime and you are taken back to the police station to be interviewed and you just tried to make up lies saying that "I was with my friend at the shopping centre and hang out together" and the IO asked who is your friend and he would force you to reveal his name and at the end his "friend" get arrested and interviewed. I hesitate to use the word "accomplice" as "friend", as in this scenario, his "friend" also commited a crime and hauled back to police station for interview and both at the end get punished by the law. In another scenario, if you came back home late and your parents questioned you why you are late and not informing them and they didn't know any background information about your friend, would they believe you in any means? Absoultely No. Your parents will think that you are just purely LYING and pulled down the amount of their trust.<br><br>Well, mr chickenlittle2, I'm bored and assume the worst for yourself. I reply to you here without any hesitation to <strong>show that the space between your ears is not empty</strong>.<br><br>Good day to you.</p></div>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Woah what a long page of replies...</p>
              <p>In my bluntest state now, I don't see a need for anyone to continue replying to chickenlittle2. I said it so many times in the past, <strong>just treat him like an idiot</strong> and nothing shall happen.</p>
              <p>He always backs up his claims with "my friend say this", "my friend say that". Do we even know if his "friend" really exists or is it just an imaginary SL friend created to support his malicious and rubbish claims.</p>
              <p>At least here in this forum there are members with higher reliability and of course, I support them rather than this stupid chicken ass. And in response to chicken's claims, I showed this to friends in the other countries who are bus fans too. After they read the replies they call you an idiotic guy with totally no sense of guilt and only knows how to pinpoint the blame on others. So you happy about that? Stop using "friends" as an excuse because it brings you NOWHERE.</p>
              <p>And to the point about Sv99, I shall be blunt again. Sv99 sucks especially with the horrible attitude of drivers from BBDEP. BBDEP is notorious for the worst attitude of drivers you can find. Couple that with that fantastic route of Sv99 and you get drivers that purposely whack to tag front bus or not drivers that drive so slowly to geng downroute. Sv99 is not at all due to jumpbus problem: If not so many other services would have removed it. It is due to the terrible driving skills of drivers.</p>
              <p>So to the rest, no need to reply to this chicken, because he is so over protective of the things around him and cannot even accept any criticism from anywhere else. It's bus fans against a chicken yet he wants to make it as if we're on the losing end. He shows it to his friends, yeah friends, but if I was his friend I would tell chicken straightaway that he sucks - to the core and he better go sign up for some courses to not make him look so stupid online, if not in the real world as well. Only friends without common sense would still applaud his childish and nonsensical behaviour.</p>
              <p>To some other points...</p>
              <p>1) I've seen Sv174 bunching in off-peak before. I always see that happening. Chicken can get back at me all he wants from "my friend say..." but it does not twist the facts a single bit.</p>
              <p>2) I rarely see Sv124 bunching except during peak hours on weekdays or during weekends.</p>
              <p>3) Sv53 and Sv76 have fantastic achievement of what is a model example of a service doing jumpbus.</p>
              <p>4) I always see Sv99 bunching, even during pre-jumpbus and post-jumpbus. It thus proves that jumpbus is not the heart of the problem but rather the sucky attitude of BBDEP drivers. I've had about enough of their rude treatment towards passengers.</p>
              <p>5) Sv74 and Sv196 as said by ^tamago^ indeed needs improvement, especially Sv196 with such a high demand.</p>
              <p>6) Sv24 demand is too high, yet they cannot put DD, but it needs improvement as well. At least it's service standards don't suck so much for an airport service, compared to Sv502.</p>
              <p>7) I've never had ANY problems with Sv88 for my 4 years in commuting with it. Sv88 is perfectly fine, except for some people who like to twist facts.</p>
              <p>Does chicken really think that by getting back to us with "I'll check with my friend and get back to you" it solves our questions? I've seen it so many times even though I do not comment on it. Many people have been watching quietly. The checking with your friend and getting back DOES NOT solve anything. The fact still remains that we have a problem with SLBP and of course, since your reliability has proven to be so low we don't believe anything from you or your friend. Do you now realise why nobody seems to reply to you after you come back and say a load of stuffs that you claim is from "your friend"? The whatever road tests and suspension tests that you claimed your friend said they have ran the tests, doesn't seem to show up in rides that I or other folks have taken. Hence the "your friend" easy-way out is not working. Try harder.</p>

              <p>Most of services at the vertical berths are suffering shortage problems. SBST should move service 79, since it is a loop service, to the sawtooth berths, which at least give one lot to 30 and 249. Quite a waste to see 2 empty lots most of the times, while other services are struggling with parking lot woes.</p>
              <p>The four bendy slots are rather redundant as most most the time they are under utilised or unused. Rather convert them to normal parking lots to park more 12m buses instead of wasting the already smaller new interchange. Bendies can park in the parallel lots since SMRT parks the buses there.</p>

              <p>agree with you on the bendy lots part. the 3 lots are marked so wide that I think they can accomodate 4 buses without problems.</p>
              <p>with the impending shift of 179 179A and 199 they should start trying to make space. during peak hours there are usually 1-2 lots available, sometimes none even. during peak 179+199 already have about 6-7 buses parking at once (from observation at old int).</p>
              <p>also, I find it interesting the old interchange only had 58 lots while they have 60 now.</p>
              <p>I am thinking other than the SMRT lots at the end, it may make space a bit tight, but they can draw more parallel lots along the road leading to the exit of the sawtooth side. disadvantage is all buses parked in the original 30 lots will have to reverse out of the lots...</p>
