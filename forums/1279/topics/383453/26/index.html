              <p>u're saying SBST don't reply to newspaper forums?</p>
              <p>i think you can ask your friends to move to your area. then we'd hear of less such problems because your buses will become more crowded when everyone starts moving to the west under e "protectorship" of slbp based on your recommendation.</p>
              <p>anyway, since u mentioned newspaper, can you help me count too? i'm sure you have confidence in the figures you cite based on the confidence you have about your claim.</p>

              <p>I have one advice which is that talk when it is really needed at the right time, don't try to make a fool of yourself down here. There are other people who are sick and tired of your nonsense. I think its best you jolly well get things into your head as there are people watching every move of yours.</p>

              <p>kindly tell me why i see 5 pages long of replies that are directed towards you. and amongst these replies i see that you even rebut what ^tamago^ and Scania said. before you even criticise on why things ends offensively, why not think of what you said and why after being rebutted you still want to give face to yourself?</p>
              <p>don't even mention about the statement in bold. i believe you don't have the right to say this when you are not even close to a example of this. if this was to be mentioned by a "senior" bus fan who has had the support of most of the bus fans here, with due respect I give to that person. but to you, stop throwing the local bus fan's images away. utter disgracefulness.</p>

              <p>Woah what a long page of replies...</p>
              <p>In my bluntest state now, I don't see a need for anyone to continue replying to chickenlittle2. I said it so many times in the past, <strong>just treat him like an idiot</strong> and nothing shall happen.</p>
              <p>He always backs up his claims with "my friend say this", "my friend say that". Do we even know if his "friend" really exists or is it just an imaginary friend created to support his malicious and rubbish claims.</p>
              <p>At least here in this forum there are members with higher reliability and of course, I support them rather than this stupid chicken ass. And in response to chicken's claims, I showed this to friends in the other countries who are bus fans too. After they read the replies they call you an idiotic guy with totally no sense of guilt and only knows how to pinpoint the blame on others. So you happy about that? Stop using "friends" as an excuse because it brings you NOWHERE.</p>
              <p>And to the point about Sv99, I shall be blunt again. Sv99 sucks especially with the horrible attitude of drivers from BBDEP. BBDEP is notorious for the worst attitude of drivers you can find. Couple that with that fantastic route of Sv99 and you get drivers that purposely whack to tag front bus or not drivers that drive so slowly to geng downroute. Sv99 is not at all due to jumpbus problem: If not so many other services would have removed it. It is due to the terrible driving skills of drivers.</p>
              <p>So to the rest, no need to reply to this chicken, because he is so over protective of the things around him and cannot even accept any criticism from anywhere else. It's bus fans against a chicken yet he wants to make it as if we're on the losing end. He shows it to his friends, yeah friends, but if I was his friend I would tell chicken straightaway that he sucks - to the core and he better go sign up for some courses to not make him look so stupid online, if not in the real world as well. Only friends without common sense would still applaud his childish and nonsensical behaviour.</p>
              <p>To some other points...</p>
              <p>1) I've seen Sv174 bunching in off-peak before. I always see that happening. Chicken can get back at me all he wants from "my friend say..." but it does not twist the facts a single bit.</p>
              <p>2) I rarely see Sv124 bunching except during peak hours on weekdays or during weekends.</p>
              <p>3) Sv53 and Sv76 have fantastic achievement of what is a model example of a service doing jumpbus.</p>
              <p>4) I always see Sv99 bunching, even during pre-jumpbus and post-jumpbus. It thus proves that jumpbus is not the heart of the problem but rather the sucky attitude of BBDEP drivers. I've had about enough of their rude treatment towards passengers.</p>
              <p>5) Sv74 and Sv196 as said by ^tamago^ indeed needs improvement, especially Sv196 with such a high demand.</p>
              <p>6) Sv24 demand is too high, yet they cannot put DD, but it needs improvement as well. At least it's service standards don't suck so much for an airport service, compared to Sv502.</p>
              <p>7) I've never had ANY problems with Sv88 for my 4 years in commuting with it. Sv88 is perfectly fine, except for some people who like to twist facts.</p>
              <p>Does chicken really think that by getting back to us with "I'll check with my friend and get back to you" it solves our questions? I've seen it so many times even though I do not comment on it. Many people have been watching quietly. The checking with your friend and getting back DOES NOT solve anything. The fact still remains that we have a problem with SLBP and of course, since your reliability has proven to be so low we don't believe anything from you or your friend. Do you now realise why nobody seems to reply to you after you come back and say a load of stuffs that you claim is from "your friend"? The whatever road tests and suspension tests that you claimed your friend said they have ran the tests, doesn't seem to show up in rides that I or other folks have taken. Hence the "your friend" easy-way out is not working. Try harder.</p>

              <p>Mine more worst. In 2009, I am schooling at ITE Clementi and have to report at 9am. When that time is during peak hours. I saw K230UB left my bus stop at Jurong West at 8.22am. So I missed the bus. I waited, waited and waited. Suddenly the bus came at 8.43am. Which is difference of almost 15-20 mins. With my eyes, I saw 3 VO3X &amp; 1 K230ub behind. At the same time, all 4 buses caught at the traffic light, bus stop and up to ITE Clementi bus stop at the same time. When I alighted at the bus stop at 9.08am, I saw another 1 99 dd behind which in total of 5 buses. Haha..what a day man...</p>
