              <p>Hello, if you stay in the central, eastern or northern part of Singapore, you would have inherited the skill of escaping ERPs, and I dare say CTE northbound is smooth flowing right now during evening peak. Then again traffic jam is an indicator of how popular regions are.</p>

              <p>Please take out your street directory, tell me what is along the big pieces of land above ECP and below Changi Rd/New Upp Changi Rd and Upp Changi Rd East, only the small patch of land known as Marine Parade is HDB. And I'm just bringing out the condo thing cos you brought up the high cost HDB flats, since you are so willing to discuss on high cost living.</p>
