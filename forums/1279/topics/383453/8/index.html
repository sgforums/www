                      jollywell know what bussiness-minded Asians can do there..BTW with
                      the upcoming rail lines i think LTA forsee bus routes cutting hence
                      the small design new AC Interchanges,Correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I'm on your side.{the part where you said why LTA gave a small designed to the new interchange}.
                      
                  By looking at URA's Concept plan, it seems that the Boon Lay MRT station will become a interchange with a MRT line that comes from the choa chu kang area and then continue on to the Jurong Industrial Area. There will also be a new LRT line(as what everyone knows) "terminating" at Boon Lay MRT station.</p>
              <p>All these will most likely happen only after 2020, when the Downtown Line and the Tuas MRT extension are constructed{reason: by looking at the tuas mrt extension tender, it seems that one of the stations(the one with 2 platforms)(on my opinion, it seems that the station will be EW30) along the tuas extension will become a terminal station for the the LRT}.</p>
              <p>According to URA's 2008 Master Plan, it is stated there that the site where the temporary interchange currently sits at will be developed into another commercial and residential place, just like the Jurong Point Extension. Will it be JP3 or will it be another "ten mile junction" that is to be owned by SMRT where the LRT depot will be located at?
                      
                  Also, if you look at the Boon Lay MRT extension annex {http://www.lta.gov.sg/images/Annex%20BLE.pdf }  that was published by LTA at about march 2006, you will see the layout of the new Boon Lay Bus Interchange.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: All the "new plans" released by the government are actually planned long time ago, perhaps even when they were planning the structure of the MRT network.</p>
              <p>There is just one thing that I'm not sure: is the new bus interchange designed to handle peak hour crowds? I have walked pass the new bus interchange several times this week and by looking into it through the glass gates(the one near JP2 carpark and another one near the JP1 bridge), I can tell that the designer had did some consideration and thinking about the expected large crowds at the interchange. Still, with the seats and information boards, is there going to be a "human traffic jam" at the bus interchange and JP2 level 1 on every peak hour?</p>
              <p>Another thing that I'm worried is whether or not there will be traffic jams along Jurong West Central 3 when the bus interchange opens. Judging by the design of the bus parking bays and the 8 route amendments announced by SBS Transit, I somehow speculate that there may be a long "bus queue" along Jurong West Central 3 and Jurong West Street 64 where buses are waiting to go into the bus interchange to drop off the passengers.</p>
              <p>Well, please pardon me for my lousy english. I am currently trying to improve it. I will be grateful if anyone can help me improve it.</p>
              <p>-no offences please-..</p>

              <p>Conclusion: All the "new plans" released by the government are actually planned long time ago, perhaps even when they were planning the structure of the MRT network.</p>
              <p>Another thing that I'm worried is whether or not there will be traffic jams along Jurong West Central 3 when the bus interchange opens. Judging by the design of the bus parking bays and the 8 route amendments announced by SBS Transit, I somehow speculate that there may be a long "bus queue" along Jurong West Central 3 and Jurong West Street 64 where buses are waiting to go into the bus interchange to drop off the passengers.</p>
              <p>Well, please pardon me for my lousy english. I am currently trying to improve it. I will be grateful if anyone can help me improve it.</p>

              <p>As for oil in Malaysia, very simply our here PAP Times dun bother reporting one. Over there Sinchew has alrdy repeatedly highlight Malaysia will soon need to import oil alrdy. Yet no one over there bothers, thinking the subsidy will forever be there.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you why things are cheap in M'sia to us - if things goes ex, Malaysian demand subsidy esp in from the 1980s. In Malaysia, sadly to say it's artfically kept low.</p>
              <p>Anyway over there corp tax and max income tax is 26%. Be glad it was reduced from 28% last yr and GST in 2011 will make it lower! It's likely Malaysia's GST would be 5%</p>
