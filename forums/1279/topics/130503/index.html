            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone can remember whether a BC had made a wrong turn in the route somewhere?<br><br>I just now saw a svc 21 (didn't catch the rego) turning left out of Tampines St 34 into Tampines Ave 7, and with passengers in it. Seems like it made a wrong turn somewhere.<br><br>Also seem to recall previous svc 28 (Tampines - New Bridge Rd) making a wrong turn into Bedok North Ave 4 when it should have been travelling straight along Upper Changi Rd (this was in the 80s). Remembered that BC thought that he was returning back to depot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Also that svc 28 BC previously thought that he was on svc 23, so he had taken the PIE route till Bendemeer, halfway only to u-turn at Eunos Link as he realised his mistake.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My 2 experiences with bus drivers boo-boo.<br><br>1) Service 36 towards CGA. Bus was entering CGA Terminal 1 when the driver turned into the wrong entrance. He went into the taxi waiting area instead of the slope down towards the bus terminal. Eventually, he reverse out and turned left again into the terminal.<br><br>2) Service 187 towards WDL. Driver missed the exit from BKE to Woodlands Ave 3 as it was a heavy thunderstorm. Instead, he went straight to the Woodlands Checkpoint exit and got the bendy stuck in the Causeway traffic jam. After being stuck in the jam for 1.5 hours, bus driver managed to turn into Kranji Road and sped towards Woodlands. Didn't see the driver again (got sacked?).</div>
