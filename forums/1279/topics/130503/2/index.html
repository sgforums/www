The poor MB0405 NAC one day came to the bus-stop heading towards AMK Int. The old BC saw potential passengers too late, and braked damn hard. The poor MB0405 gave up, and the bus stalled, smoke came out! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>That was my expression awright! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that SBST &amp; SMRTB should allow new BCs ply on shorter routes (eg feeder svc, svc with low passenger demand) initially. Just imagine; the new BC needs time to adjust to the new working conditions, even though they had completed their orientation courses. They are now alone and working independently..<br><br>I won't be surprised if he/she forgot to stop at the next stop when a passenger presses the bell, or forgot to open/close the door. Driving a public bus seems simple. However, when you're really in their position (esp when you're still new), that's a totally different story.<br><br>Even new car drivers who had just passed their driving tests and are on the roads might not drive as confidently and well compared a seasoned driver.<br><br>Even for me; I was very different and blur when I first stepped into the society to work. Similarly, that's what I generally observed in new army recruits, new colleagues in the workplace, etc.<br><br></div>
