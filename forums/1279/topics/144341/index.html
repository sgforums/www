            <div class='col-md body'>SBST had recently implemented many initiatives and bus services:<br><br>a. city buzzes<br>b. park buses to labrador<br>c. chinatown direct from bedok, clementi, amk<br>d. 174FF<br>e. 4 new bus services in a span of a month, 48, 34, 57, 58<br><br>And what new services we had from smrt? 950 and ????<br><br>Its obvious that SbsT has more resources and initiatives. I pity those staying in sembawang, bukit panjang, yew tee...., rather those staying in so called 'smrt' territory.<br><br>If SBST has sufficient resources and willing to spend and invest in buses, why restrict SBST to ply into SMRT territory. I believe SBST can come up with many initiatives and new routes.<br><br>To me it's a mistake for selling TIBS to SMRT. SMRT having the rail plying the EW and NS coridoors, had little motivation to introduces new services to 'grab' passengers from its rail businesses.<br><br>Do you see SBST introduces new services that ply along NEL? Likewise do you think SMRT would ply new routes along EW and NS?<br><br>Frequency on  SMRT trains is getting longer, up to 7minutes. Thus it is getting more packed. Taking train is no longer a pleasant experience. Previously I would take trains to City Hall, Bugis, Lavendar, Outram Park from BV. Nowadays I prefer buses. With 48, I need not have to rely on train to Bugis and Lavendar.<br><br>Having SbsT plying on SMRT territory, Yew Tee and BP could have more bus services.<br><br>Perhaps PTC should allows SBST to ply into smrt territory if:<br><br>a. SMRT is unable to provide more direct and frequent bus services.<br>b. SMRT trains had reached a 'set' occupancy, say 70%.<br><br>PTC should aware that SMRT trains is getting more and more packed, even during non peak hours!<br><br>I have always wondered why Sunset estates has no buses to Orchard? And why sunset residents had to rely on Singapore Trolley buses on each morning?<br><br>Hope PTC would seriously look into the transport woes for those staying in the west, or more appropriately, those staying in SMRT territory.<br></div>

Yes, both companies can operate services in each other's territory freely, as long as the routes help to improve connectivity to commuters.<br><br>You should have seen that both companies have their "areas of responsibility ". This means that the company has been assigned to operate certain bus interchanges/terminals and towns, ensuring that these towns they have been assigned to is served as best as possible. The towns controlled by the other company are secondary, as each company must ensure the needs of the commuters under their areas of responsibilities are met first. So don't be surprised if you see a SBST service operating between Woodlands and Yishun, or a SMRT service operating between Boon Lay and Tampines; it's perfectly possible.</div>
