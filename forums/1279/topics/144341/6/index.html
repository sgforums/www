What profit are they making from it? Not much. Especially the MRT the people who take them are almost the same every single day, so profit remains quite stagnant(only changes a bit) unless they raise fare. As for buses, profits getting lower due to their lack of initiatives towards customers.<br><br>So what do they really care? TAXIS. In recent years, they have been buying taxis and promoting them a lot. Do u see ads about buses or mrts in their stations? No. They only advertise their taxis. Such as the recent "Good service" ads. Truthfully speaking, i am sick of smrt in choa chu kang, woodlands, sembawang, yishun, btp &amp; btb. They are just torturing us commuters with long frequencies and spoiled buses.<br><br>Just the other day, i had to ride a Habit with non-working air con on 188 from CCK. basically, it was a non-air con trip. They should have stopped that bus from service especially because of the fact the bus was from an interchange. but what can we do? all we can do is just complain and whine but it is all useless. they don't change...tibs was better of without smrt and smrt was better off as a government-run company.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
