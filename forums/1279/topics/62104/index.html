            <div class='col-md body'>I came out with this suggestion.<br><br>Service 25 to amend to ply via Hougang Ave 8, Ave 4, Central, Upp Serangoon Rd and continue with its current route. The amendment will cause service 25 to skip majority of Hougang Ave 2. This is to maintain the link between Hougang Central and Jln Eunos. Alternative service along Hougang Ave 2 is service 854 (to Eunos and Bedok) and service 132 (to Ang Mo Kio) [Service 132 to extend to Serangoon interchange to maintain the link between Ang Mo Kio and Kovan]<br><br>With the amendment of service 25, service 51 will be shortened to ply between Jurong East interchange and New Bridge Rd terminal. Alternative services from Hougang Central to Sims Ave/Geylang Rd is by services 62 and to Sims Ave/Geylang Rd/Bugis/Chinatown is by service 80. As for the stretch between Jln Eunos and Aljunied Rd, passengers can take service 854 and transfer to service 21 along Jln Eunos.<br></div>

SBST would not give up monopoly at Hougang Ave 2 to service 854. In this way, service 25 could lose pax to 854 as it is not as direct as 854. There's already service 87 from Bedok to Hougang Central.</div>
