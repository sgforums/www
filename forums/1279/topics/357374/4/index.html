              <p><br> can zip or not? i've had enough of your quacking. tell people don't
              waste time here, what about you? if you are just
              <strong>BIASED</strong> against US and the BC, then just get your
              corpse out of this place. it stinks and just brings down the
              reputation of us.</p>
              <p>ask yourself, which duckling will raise the leg to tap your
              ez-link cards? lazy to take out from pocket what.. do you do that?
              how about raising your legs in your parents face? ohoh, unless you
              don't have, which explains such doglike manners. and they're your
              seniors for goodness sake. people help you drive bus everyday,
              still have to face such insults. there are a lot of friendly bc's
              out there, it's just that you guys just keep zooming in on the
              negative factors when you don't even give a shit to those that are
              really helpful and kind. plain biasesness. stomp should just close
              down. waste of money and negative things shown there only. how
              often do you see the light of the BC's?</p>

              <p>look, i didn't mean to be that rude, but it's just that, since
              you called people pathetic names, why can't you be labelled as
              one?</p>

              <p>Errr. If you think we are using vulgarities. Please take a look at our previous posts. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, you can check the whole thread. We did not even use a single vulgar word. So, are you sure you saying the right thing?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, this thread is becoming more like a thread that is probably a CrapBox or a thread that is merely using up bandwidth and space in the first page of the forum. I do not suggest you should pursue the matter.</p>
              <p>If you really want to call up and complain the BC, then you go ahead. Just remember that BCs have a hard time at work. Ending their shifts at 1am. Sleeping at only 2am everyday. Going to work as early as 4am to 5am. It's not easy. You ask any BC. Please, just spare a thought for the BC. They have to serve thousands of people a day under these conditions. You sure you want to make them suffer? If yes then, I think you are very wicked.</p>

              <p>I think the problem here is that people make sweeping statements. Lots. Just be mindful of what you say as it may be false. If you have a crowd of people blasting back at you and you and probably a few people on your side say that everyone on the other side is stupid, crazy, immature, or whatever you want to say, then you're just living in self-denial. And that's the worst crime you can ever do to yourself.</p>
              <p>To the rest - why even bother. People can say all they want but do they really prove their words with their actions? No. They only talk glamorously behind a wall of virtuality. Besides, if they were really to "take action" then isn't that equivalent to throwing themselves in jail? So relax people... just remember that lots of people are are <strong>N</strong>o <strong>A</strong>ction <strong>T</strong>alk <strong>O</strong>nly. The internet is what gives them self-entertainment, though perhaps a bit too much pathetic for sympathy.</p>
