              <p>how true this incident is, no one knows except for those at the scene on that day.</p>
              <p>so in a way, no one is right to say that he did it on purpose or whatever other reasons.</p>
              <p>have you ever spared a thought, about the hardships a bus driver has to go through just to earn what many people classify as 'a miserly pay' to everyone else? start work early, work long hours, go home late.</p>
              <p>worse yet, the driver has to put up with the shit that some assholes give them.</p>
              <p>when a bus driver provides good service, has anyone ever bothered to publicly praise them? it's merely a handful of people who do so. but when a bus captain makes a slight mistake, there are tons of people waiting to cascade a whole load of complaints. so why don't you all elitist people just quit thinking that way and at least appreciate the services that bus drivers render for you?</p>
              <p>i don't think we see shopping center cashiers as 'low class people' earning 'a miserly pay', and i don't think we complain so much about them unless they provide utterly horrendous service. bus drivers and cashiers, clerks, etc are of a similar family, they work in the service industry. so why don't we just give this a break and not nitpick on our bus captains?</p>

              <p>so we are behaving unruly?? Then that makes you a satan. Yes, I agree tht given the bus drivers attitude towards passengers they should receive disiplinary actions from the company. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">BUT</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">, tht does not give u the right </span>to insult bus drivers to that kind of level.
