              <p>Wad to do, its this kind of people who complain and complain and complain until no one wanna drive bus. Then SBST &amp; SMRT will get china ppl come drive bus then ppl also complain complain complain of too many china ppl.</p>
              <p>In the end, why SBST &amp; SMRT got into this mess?? Why too many china ppl driving bus &amp; asking for directions so difficult?? Why not enough ppl driving bus?? Simple, it's ppl who complain here &amp; there, up &amp; down, left &amp; right, north south east west everywhere. So you can't blame SBST &amp; SMRT ppl for getting too many china ppl. It's those typical ppl who simply luv to complain scares off the bus captains.</p>
              <p>So to those typical ppl who simply luv to complain, dun blame the bus company for getting such a mess. If you all wanna blame, blame urself.</p>

              <p>imagine BC wake up 4am in the morning, some end late at 1.30am. Some even wake up at 4am and work until 11am then go home &amp; then come back to work at 3pm &amp; work until 8-9pm then go home sleep &amp; wake up again the next day at 4am. BC on the roads lambat like siao due to heavy traffic, want to run also cannot run cauze they scared kena accident or statement then their rice bowl gone. Everyday face ppl like u small things wanna complain &amp; must endure criticism. You tell me which BC not pek chiek.</p>
              <p>And for your info, we bus fans alone has seen many nasty drivers 10 times more than you. Ask any drivers and u knw what i mean.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You elitist behaviour sucks. Don't like public transport? Feel that Singapore's transportation system is a failure? Then go take cab or take your car for goodness sakes and stop complaining like the stupid STOMPers now who just NEED to post rubbish. Your comments come across as extremely shallow. Do you EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your attitude is disgusting... I
              have been observing the going-ons on this thread for quite some time
              and I am disturbed with what you wrote. That PATRONISING attitude of
              yours... The way you
              DEMEAN OTHERS by insultig their job is out of place. Are you trying to say you are superior to others? You are insulting other people's intelligence when you say,<br><br> <br><br>" what about bus drivers who can't be bothered to put in effort to
                                      drive safely always jerk and jerk.  A number of times me and
                                      other passengers nearly fall because of this.   Once I
                                      witnessed an old lady's body swayed sideward and nearly fall when
                                      the idiotic, selfish, evil driver jerk jerk.   </p>
              <p>To some people, they can just choose to ignore the

              you learn to be not a show-off? Granted the
              comments there were less than satisfactory, but there is no need for
              such a blatant disregard of other forum members own opinions. Are you
              such a control freak that wants others to think the way you do?! This is a public forum and people are
              entitled to express their views. Do you think everything others say are
              off-topic? In this entire thread IMHO the most ridiculous comment was
              the one you made. Saying these things in a bus forum is somewhat political incorrect. Why don't
              you jolly well do some self-reflection and practice what you preach.
              Are you so high and mighty and above others? Just imagine how much
              anger, contempt and displeasure I have for those comments of yours that
              I have to write this down here.<br><br> <br><br>You sure people don't think before posting stuff???<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Highly outrageous behaviour indeed.
              The comments make me believe that you are trying to give the impression
              "get out of my elite uncaring face[/threads]". Are you proud to say
              that you flame others like that? Your comments irk me and I do believe
              it irks others as well. Such highly snobbish attitude...<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>I know this post of
              mine may or may not get me flamed by others. But your PATRONISING
              ATTITUDE is just APPALLING, DISGUSTING, and UNCALLED FOR! You need a reality check!<br></p>
