              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Was onboard <strong>SBS7671T</strong> on 10 earlier, when this
              incident happened... At Opp PSA Bldg bus stop, the BC suddenly
              stopped there because of a female passenger who had told him to
              stop as she made an urgent call. According to another passenger,
              she had called the police to ask them to help transport her uncle
              (who had apparently fainted on the upper deck) to the hospital. <strong>The
              BC had trouble understanding the situation as he could not
              understand English.</strong> After 5 minutes, angry passengers asked the BC
              to open the doors to let them alight, but he refused. After a while
              of complaining, the BC finally opened the doors and most passengers
              alighted. Finally, the police arrived and the passengers were
              allowed to board without tapping their card again due to the delay.
              The BC sped for the rest of the journey to make up for the lost
              time.</p>
              <p>Duration: 7.49p.m. to 7.57p.m.</p>

              <p>Off Topic here but the bolded part you are talking about was a China BC?? so this kind of nonsense is still happening.. iirc some time back,i read somewhere that those china BCs are sent to learn english first before they can officially start work.. so all that is bullshit as usual i guess..</p>

              <p>This bus was not supposed to be on this duty. This duty was originally done by 1566M.

              time and hit. Driver probably injured.</p>

              <p><br>apparently now i heard its not driver fault..a car hit the pole, the road sign collapsed and hit the bus..seems the left side windows between the 2 doors got damaged with scratches...</p>
              <p>I think since this bus is new, may not come out so fast since they want claim insurance...like what happened to SMB212R last time (MIA 1.5 months though damage from accident was minimal)</p>
              <p>which also means SMB1586E was at the wrong place at the wrong time...if its back on its usual slot, it will be SMB1566M that will kena but now SMB1566M is running healthily on 307AP02...haha!!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>might be faster and more economic to just remove the front from one of the MK1s awaiting scrap and replace like what they do for 700X last time. If they going to spend time rebuilding a new front, its not really worth it, this bus only has max 3yrs lifespan left. For 8074, I think the bus still had a long lifespan left so still worth it to build a new front. But in another case, 8900 was scraped instead of being saved even though the bus was still very new back then. </p></div>
