              <p>In between 705pm and 735pm, there was no bus departing Boon Lay Int on 172. The previous one that left was an unknown bendy (presume to be 1030P on 172S103). Next bus that arrived was SMB111Z (172S108) at around 735pm. Bus was already around 17 mins late. Bus was packed by the 2nd stop, and only a couple could board at subsequent stops..</p>
              <p>SMB111Z finally arrived CCK INT around 820pm and was 10 mins late. As SMB111Z arrived, an unknown MAN with light blue ad departed on 172PM04 slot, likely to be an epull as i did not spot any light blue MAN on AP duty today...</p>
              <p>As such, SMB6U should have been removed from service somewhere during PM peak...</p>

Caused a heavy jam behind as buses behind didnt know it had broken down. SMB1650C on 190 was waiting behind TIB697Y to pick up passengers. Many buses behind (both incoming and outgoing) were stuck and was unable to move.</p>
              <p>At 532pm, technician was deployed and the bus was still unable to close its door. Technician decided to declare it breakdown and told the BC to put breakdown sign at back of bus. Another SMRT staff diverted SMB1650C to pick up pax beside TIB697Y and also diverted other buses behind. <strong>Ended up BC didnt know how to put the sign and used the red box and a 970 rear desto that he found in the bus to form a triangle. (LOL!!) </strong> Guess the technician saw it and taught him to use the triangle in the red box. During that time, SMB1570A on 307 also parked behind TIB697Y and technician diverted it to pick up pax like how SMB1650C did. When i left on SMB1570A, traffic behind was generally cleared...</p>

              <p>Yet another 307 bus meet into accident.... (4th 307 bus to meet into accident within half a year after 1586E -- march, 1538U -- june  and 1574P -- june)</p>
              <p><strong>Time:</strong> 1250hrs<br><strong>Location:</strong> Teck Whye Ave (Traffic light that link between Blk 4 and Teck Whye market)<br><strong>Bus involved:</strong> SMB1575L (307AM06)<br><strong>Service:</strong> 307E</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SMB1575L</span></strong> rear-ended a car (driven by a malay family) at the above-mentioned traffic light. Car had its rear windscreen smashed and rear bumper damaged. Bus right side signal light area completely gone but from what i see from another bus, no other visible damage to the bus. Bus was driven by a very young friendly malaysian BC (I know the name but will not post here) who just drove 307 for around 1 month. Boarded his bus before a number of times and he is usually very careful and patient so im not sure what happened that caused this accident. LTA officer was there when i passby there...</p>
