              <p>No wonder today I was waiting at Pioneer MRT station bus stop for bus 179, but after a while, 179 still never come. That time was around 6:30pm. In the end, I took 241 and transferred to 243 at the swimming pool bus stop.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #888888;">Update on this accident:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bus invloved was SBS9612B. Accident happened at 10am and it uprooted a lamp post. The lamp post is trapped between the bus</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and the bus shelter roof, and could fall if disturbed; leaking diesel from<span class="text_exposed_show"> the bus has also rendered the pavement slippery.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show">Many 179 were stuck as the road was not really passable, and the campus red line had to go into School of Biological Sciences (SBS) lobby to pick up pax. Subsequent 179s were re-routed. 3 kinds of re-routes were made:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>1. Bus ends at Blk 948 stop, enter Street 91 and loop and start trip again from Blk 705 (same route as 241)</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>2. Bus ends at Lee Wee Nam Library (BS 27211) in NTU, then goes straight into Nanyang Cres (opp direction of 199) and exit NTU via main exit to continue journey.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>3. (heard from BC) Single deck buses were deployed (epull) and some of them were made to go thru SBS lobby...but then the only single deck bus i saw was SBS8064P, epull from 243W, but BC of SBS8064P apparently dun know where to go as he was epulled to do 179...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show">Road only cleared at 120pm when SBS9612B was finally towed out. The first buses to clear the road were SBS8064P and SBS3629T while the last bus to do re-route was SBS3642D that did the re-route number 1 (attempted to board this bus but BC say this bus dun go to NTU, later saw it turned into Street 91).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show">At the moment SBS3629T passed by the accident area (i was on this bus), police, traffic police,NTU campus security and SBS Transit staff were still there investigating the incident...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show">Dont understand, this happen at an upslope, many 179s struggle to go up the slope after stopping at the slope bus stop...and the impact at the accident area seems to show the speed of bus was relatively fast...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="text_exposed_show">Damage to bus is the front windows and the bumper area...damage to the bus looks not serious....</span></span></p>

Happened at <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Junction of CCK Drive and KJE (twd Woodlands) slip road entrance (towards CCK Ave 4). Damage to the bus was quite substantial...webbed windscreen, the front portion of the bus (bumper and area above bumper) dented in quite badly and was dislodged...</span></p>
              <p>Buses that are going off service into KJE cannot turn in and they have to detour and go via CCK Way instead...</p>
              <p>Hopefully the motorcyclist is alright..from the impact seen from the damage of the bus, bus could be speeding...</p>

              <p>Double the trouble. Guess what added on to the MRT breakdown yesterday?</p>
              <p>Service 43 SBS5157A broke down at Buangkok MRT station yesterday at 6.35 am yesterday when the MRT was down. Red triangle spotted behind the bus. At first, I thought is was pulled out to do MRT shuttle, until I spotted the red triangle. I couldn't see it at first because of the crowd.</p>
              <p><em>P.S. The MRT service was disrupted. Shouldn't the red triangle be underground?</em></p>
