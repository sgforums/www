              <p>Around 1pm: SBS3665M (HGDEP 161) on service 161 broke-down along SLE towards TPE before Lentor exit. Bus left Woodlands as normal, started huuing like a KUB which gradually got louder (but not as loud as SBS3752U which sounds like a KUB inside and sounds like a B9TL CDGE on the outside, from far can hear it huuing). There was a grinding noise while the bus was passing the Mandai exit. Then along SLE before Lentor exit the BC stopped the bus at the road shoulder. Apparently something burst (not the tires). Not sure because I was right at the back and couldn't really hear the BC. But there was an alarm buzzing away so sounds quite serious.</p>
              <p>Fortunately the next bus (Citaro) was able to pick all of us up. But packed to the door.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #888888;">Update on this
              accident:</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Bus invloved was SBS9612B.
              Accident happened at 10am and it uprooted a lamp post. The lamp
              post is trapped between the bus</span> <span style="color: #000000;">and the bus shelter roof, and could fall if
              disturbed; leaking diesel from <span>the bus has also
              rendered the pavement slippery.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Many 179 were stuck
              as the road was not really passable, and the campus red line had to
              go into School of Biological Sciences (SBS) lobby to pick up
              pax. Subsequent 179s were re-routed. 3 kinds of re-routes were
              made:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><strong>1. Bus ends
              at Blk 948 stop, enter Street 91 and loop and start trip again from
              Blk 705 (same route as 241)</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><strong>2. Bus ends
              at Lee Wee Nam Library (BS 27211) in NTU, then goes straight into
              Nanyang Cres (opp direction of 199) and exit NTU via main exit to
              continue journey.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span><strong>3. (heard
              from BC) Single deck buses were deployed (epull) and some of them
              were made to go thru SBS lobby...but then the only single deck bus
              i saw was SBS8064P, epull from 243W, but BC of SBS8064P apparently
              dun know where to go as he was epulled to do
              179...</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Road only cleared
              at 120pm when SBS9612B was finally towed out. The first buses to
              clear the road were SBS8064P and SBS3629T while the last bus to do
              re-route was SBS3642D that did the re-route number 1 (attempted to
              board this bus but BC say this bus dun go to NTU, later saw it
              turned into Street 91).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>At the moment
              SBS3629T passed by the accident area (i was on this bus), police,
              traffic police,NTU campus security and SBS Transit staff were still
              there investigating the incident...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Dont understand,
              this happen at an upslope, many 179s struggle to go up the slope
              after stopping at the slope bus stop...and the impact at the
              accident area seems to show the speed of bus was relatively
              fast...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>Damage to bus is
              the front windows and the bumper area...damage to the bus looks not
              serious....</span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SMB3162G (979PM05) </span></strong>had problems with the ez link machine. Pax could not tap out, keep showing Invalid Card E1. </p>
              <p>BC called OCC using his handphone at Blk 681 (BS 45401). OCC eventually instructed him to continue journey and all boarding and alighting pax no need pay. During the delay, TWO 302s  (TIB1027A and TIB1177A) overtook the bus and many passengers were complaining saying they should have boarded the 302s.</p>
              <p>This caused confusion as there were a couple of elderlies on the bus and they wanted to alight as they thought the bus had broken down, as BC only reported the situation in English, he say no need tap and can claim at any transitlink office..</p>
              <p>Happened around 315pm today (291215)</p>
