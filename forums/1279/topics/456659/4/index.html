              <p><br>Sure. That's another option. You can have roadside bus stops at Changi - safer and better.</p>

              <p>You need 2 of the 3. My recommendation is 27M and 27E (Ofcourse 27M would be renumbered as 27).</p>
              <p>But it may not make sense from a resources point of view to have 27, 27M and 27E.</p>
              <p>I think even if we can modify 27 to loop at Tampines Ave 1 or terminate at Tampines Int via Tampines Ave 4 with DD fleet, it will resolve the worries of many. Especially it is very uncomfortable when you are standing in a cramped bus all the way from Tampines to Punggol Road. You need DDs for long-haul routes.</p>
              <p>What is so difficult in implementing this? We all speak about QoS. This is REAL QoS for us. And either way there is 34 that goes through most of 27's route on the Tampines side. Increase a bus or two on it if required.</p>

              <p>Best solutions :<br><br>1. Introduce 27M to stop in Tampines Int.</p>
              <p>2. Make a new bus interchange in PTB 2 that is high enough to accomodate double deckers. Pessangers can access PTB 3 and PTB 1 with the CGA Shuttle/Skytrain.<br><br></p>

              <p>LTA is hopeless. What have they done after they take over as centralise bus planner. Nothing - except every quarter says that buses and that route has added more buses and bigger capacity buses are deployed. Fair for SBST but how about the bloody SMRT bus services.</p>

During NSL breakdown, 100% bunching occur.<br><br>101 - Rarely bunches up at Buangkok Link area, where it does the U-Turn. Normally bunches up once is a while. When it bunches, there is usually a strider.<br><br>156 - Only bunches in Sengkang direction. Rarely bunches up towards Clementi due to the proximity of Sengkang Int.<br><br>325 - Never bunches, even during NSL/NEL breakdown.
