              <p>I agree that it is difficult to spot all of them in one junction.</p>
              <p>My point was that it is not like 4x27's together or 4x74's together, because 72, 88 and 854 all have different routes, and I have seen back-to-back buses on all these 3 routes completely packed.</p>
              <p>And hence, with these very high loading routes having 2 buses together may not be that bad compared to say watching 2x165 DDs together or 2x143 DDs together.</p>
              <p>See my point? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Very common since the loas of 190 is mad, in CCK Int, from what I see at 1pm ytd, it filled up the WHOLE BERTH in just within 2-4 minutes. Load just got more when arriving at the first bus stop after leaving CCK Int. Since bus frequency is like 3-6mins...<br><br>About 90% of the load was dispersed at TANGS PLAZA.<br><br></p>

              <p>I think that's where 27A needs DDs. When buses bunch up, the bus
              behind has little or no passengers. 3 mins frequency for a bus is
              taking up too much road space too. 27A should have a frequency of
              06 minutes and the normal 27 of 10 minutes. 27A should be full
              fleet DD and 27 has to be SD.</p>
              <p>This way bus bunching can be avoided while making sure people
              get a place to sit, and the buses and road space is better
              utilized.</p>

              <p>27A should also be deployed in a way that it arrives (in close succession) before 27, so that people who genuinely need to get to Changi Airport are able to board bus 27. Many a times I have had to board 27A only to alight after TPE and run for the 27 in front of 27A.</p>

              <p>tampines 938? that stop dont have the 27 downroute unless you are talking about 27 full route bunching?</p>
              <p>if you have the time and not lazy, I would suggest you to head to T2 to board the bus. save distance fare, healthier by walking more (if from T3), and if there's no bus at T2, you can be pretty sure the next one should arrive pretty soon.. assuming normal traffic conditions.</p>

              <div>iris for service 27 is also pretty inaccurate - the arrival
              timings keep changing especially near airport area. Sometimes 6
              minutes can mean 1 minute in real life. Perhaps the buses lose GPS
              connectivity underground and iris cannot track where those buses
              are?</div>

              <p><br>27A just needs DDs. Frequency is already too good. 27A should be made 27M, extended to Hougang Interchange and should run throughout the day with frequency of 07 mins - that's where the main load is. 27 should run as an Express Service with 10 minute frequency going to Changi Airport missing a few stops in Tampines, where 34 overlaps to go to Changi.</p>
              <p>This will definitely improve the QoS of 27 and make the journey more comfortable for passengers. Also as you rightly pointed out making 27 Express, will make sure that people wanting to go to Changi will get a place with their luggage.</p>

              more (if from T3), and if there's no bus at T2, you can be pretty
              sure the next one should arrive pretty soon.. assuming normal

              <p>Yup, 27 full route bunching! iris is hopeless at that bus stop too... keeps saying Arriving but no bus comes. From personal experience I have found that T3 is the best place to board, as I can always get a seat, and there always seems to be very little people queueing for 27. But it might just be because of timing!</p>

              <p>Best is to like SMRT, introduce parallel service.<br>If SBS cannot do anything about 27, they still can introduce a new service, similar to BPS1, but for SBST, it is named 27M [ Parallel Service 27 ] to ply 27's route from Hougang -&gt; Tampines Int [LOOP] and back. While many Tampines crowd near Tampines Interchange can take 27M, rather than take 27. This can relieve about 50-70% of the Tampines Crowd. While those taking 27 further away from Tampines Int, can still choose to take 27. And for those heading to CGA, like what BA said, introduce 27E. Plies Hougang Int &gt; Buangkok MRT &gt; Sengkang &gt; Tampines &gt; Changi Airport Ter 3. It must ply some Tampines stop if not it should just be a new service from Hougang straight to CGA. This should NOT loop in Changi Airport. If not, the purpose of 27M is lost. Best is to make SBST introduce 27M first.</p>
