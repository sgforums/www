              <p>Yesterday evening 6 pm at Haw Par Villa station, I spotted a double decker train - with that I mean 7 buses back to back. This was on the opposite stop to where I was, so could see all the buses.</p>

              <p>This is during evening peak. It is such a waste of resources when buses bunch and the BCs just snail behind the buses ahead rather than creating some distance in between.</p>

              <p>My argument is that if you see a bus of the same number ahead, slow down so that you at least create a 3-5 minutes gap between the next bus. In this case, the first bus becomes slow, the 2nd bus becomes fast, creating a huge gap for the 3rd bus. </p>
              <p>If a 3 minute interval is created, you at least carry more passengers coming to the bus stop in the 3 minute interval.</p>

              <p>27 bunching is fine and understandable because frequency is 04/05 mins - so possible. Yesterday I saw 3 x 51's bunch together at Bugis. </p>
              <p>The irritating thing was that the 1st was SD, 2nd and 3rd are DD. KUB was full to the brim, 2nd DD had a few pax, 3rd had few pax too. There should be a way in which DDs should go before the SD, coz passengers in the KUB were filled to the brim and the Wrights were not getting well-utilized. </p>
              <p>Again, with a frequency of 15 mins, 3 buses coming together means the 1st 51 must have arrived at least after an interval of 30 minutes. Uff. </p>

              <p>Service 88 and 74 bunching is quite common. I once checked SGTransport bus timing then I saw</p>
              <p>74   Arriving, Arriving</p>
              <p>88   Arriving, Arriving</p>
              <p>Bus 74 is usually bunch when going to interchange</p>
              <p>Bus 88 (twrds Toa Payoh, gd luck trying to park) an unbelivable 6 buses came. No kidding:</p>
              <p>1st bus: Leyland Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>2nd bus: Volvo B10TL Super Olympian</p>
              <p>3rd bus: Leyland Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>4th bus: Volvo Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>5th bus Volvo Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>6th bus: Scania K230UB Euro V</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, from Pasir Ris, 88 will be spammed with LO3x or VO3x, then bunching with B9TL. Should adjust svc 88 timing since yesterday I was going out then I check </p>
              <p>88   Arriving, 48mins</p>
              <p>Pretty crazy</p>

              <p>every night i see this happening. these 2 services come in like one after another. bunch like siao. then sometimes cause the road to jam up somemore. then sometimes they never put either of the two services. then other times display other service number. but hor whole day will have la especially once during the day and once after sunset but more frequent is during this time! best part is iris the bus cannot detect cos cannot find service and route details.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the two services are: SBS Transit, Off Service.</p>

              <p>I think that's where 27A needs DDs. When buses bunch up, the bus behind has little or no passengers. 3 mins frequency for a bus is taking up too much road space too. 27A should have a frequency of 06 minutes and the normal 27 of 10 minutes. 27A should be full fleet DD and 27 has to be SD.</p>
              <p>This way bus bunching can be avoided while making sure people get a place to sit, and the buses and road space is better utilized.</p>
