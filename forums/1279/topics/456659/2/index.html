              <p>Service 88 and 74 bunching is quite common. I once checked SGTransport bus timing then I saw</p>
              <p>74   Arriving, Arriving</p>
              <p>88   Arriving, Arriving</p>
              <p>Bus 74 is usually bunch when going to interchange</p>
              <p>Bus 88 (twrds Toa Payoh, gd luck trying to park) an unbelivable 6 buses came. No kidding:</p>
              <p>1st bus: Leyland Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>2nd bus: Volvo B10TL Super Olympian</p>
              <p>3rd bus: Leyland Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>4th bus: Volvo Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>5th bus Volvo Olympian 3-axle</p>
              <p>6th bus: Scania K230UB Euro V</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, from Pasir Ris, 88 will be spammed with LO3x or VO3x, then bunching with B9TL. Should adjust svc 88 timing since yesterday I was going out then I check </p>
              <p>88   Arriving, 48mins</p>
              <p>Pretty crazy</p>

              <p>I have seen at max 2 buses of 74 and 88 bunching together. I think for these 2 routes considering the high load it is okay, because both seem to be well utilized.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I feel when a BC sees the same # bus ahead, BC should not rush to chase a signal and bunch with the bus - either slow down to take more pax or overtake and go faster and take pax.</p>
              <p>But just sticking to the ass of the bus ahead, does absolutely no good.</p>
              <p>Is there no incentive for taking more pax for the BC?</p>

              <p><br>Bunching on 179 is also common because of its 3 minute frequency. Once I monitored in the morning peak, there were 10 DDs that came at an interval of 1-2 minutes, but surprisingly all of them were half full. Looks like they were rushed off from the bus interchange, once the DD had 40-50 pax as there was another DD waiting behind.</p>
              <p>But what I liked here is that the buses weren't bunching. There was a gap between the bus though it was 1 or 2 minutes.</p>

              <p>Please do remember that during SMRT NSL breakdown, quite a number of buses are pulled from 154 [ NO WRIGHTS! ] and 28 to serve 88, Including the only citaro, SBS6007T. At that time, around 11 buses can be seen stacking at Hougang-Sengkang area already.</p>

              <p>May be traffic conditions but a lot to do with BCs - the way they drive.</p>
              <p>My recent experience with #65. I took it outside Concord Hotel (Orchard road) and was getting down at Kaki Bukit Ctr (Bedok Reservoir Road). This was in the afternoon, yet the bus was well-seated (must be 60 - 65 pax). I checked through iris the bus ahead was 13 minutes and the next bus behind was 14 minutes.</p>
              <p>This BC would at every stop, wait for all cars to pass, and only then would take the bus out. It was frustrating coz he would wait for cars to take a turn to the road, even if he has right of way. On the way on Macpherson road, it let a 8 and a 64 overtake it. </p>
              <p>At Macpherson station, I could see the 65 that was 14 minutes away had already caught up with this one and was right behind. When I got down at Kaki Bukit, the 65 behind was still stuck to it, and while I was crossing the road, I saw another 65 joining them at the signal. That is 3 DDs bunching together. </p>
              <p>It was the slowest and most irritating ride and I felt like whacking the BC. </p>
