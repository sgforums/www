More downtrips evening peak till end of service for sv190,700,960 back to CCK,BPJ, WDL<br><br>3. More dwntrip morning peak for sv190,960 that commence from BPJ<br><br>4. PERM Scanias for sv16<br><br>5. Most controversial of the them all:  Better scheduling of buses, ie higher capacity buses[DDs,bendys] on weekends so that frequency can be pushed up to 13 - 14 mins so that BCs/SLs can have a better rest, 5day week...<br><br>ACx</p></div>

              <p>- SBST to buy more double deckers, and of other makes, like Volvo B9TL with Enviro 500 body, Alexander Dennis Enviro 500, MAN Lioncity double decker, and maybe a Mercedes Benz Citaro double decker specially for SBST. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>- SBST to get more hybrid demostrators from European makes like Volvo B5L, 7700, Mercedes Benz Citaro, MAN LionCity, Irisbus Citelis <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>- SBST to introduce more services to the north and northwest and an express airport service from the west and a city service to Punggol. More bus services parallel to MRT lines as MRT is not reliable. Maybe extend 11 to Eunos, 76 and 162 to Yishun. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>- Deploy Citaros to services like 36, 39, 85, 162. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>- Faster trips for some SBST services (e.g. 72, 81, 196) although generally many of them are already faster. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> Further optimise frequencies of some services as well.</p>
              <p>- Preserve a Volvo Olympian 2xles in SBST HQ as part of remembering the last non air con bus in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>- LTA and SMRT to fully ban new bendy buses and SMRT to bring in double deckers in future, probably from MAN.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"> Reintroduce double deckers to 190.</p>
              <p>- SMRT to remove the in board annoucements in their new buses like the Citaros and MAN. Damn irritating and unnecessary. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>

              an express airport service from the west and a city service to
              Punggol. More bus services parallel to MRT lines as MRT is not

              <p>I suggest that citaros can deploy on all feeder services then others to the trunk services like 165,196,93 and also DDs for 96.</p>
              <p>SMRT have already taken the north side so even..If you can just suggest new routes to SMRT.</p>
              <p>VO batch 1 deregistering next year Batch 2 deregistering @ 2013-2015 while batch 3 is 2016-2017..SBST will buy buses within either 2-3 years?before the old buses is gonna deregister.</p>
              <p>For bendies.yes it takes alot of place but it's still good because of capacity,it's a trademark for SMRT but bendies are faster than the DDs.</p>

              <p>I suggest that citaros can deploy on all feeder services then others to the trunk services like 165,196,93 and also DDs for 96.</p>
              <p>SMRT have already taken the north side so even..If you can just suggest new routes to SMRT.</p>
              <p>VO batch 1 deregistering next year Batch 2 deregistering @ 2013-2015 while batch 3 is 2016-2017..SBST will buy buses within either 2-3 years?before the old buses is gonna deregister.</p>
              <p>For bendies.yes it takes alot of place but it's still good because of capacity,it's a trademark for SMRT but bendies are faster than the DDs.</p>

              <p>Looking into the feasibility of usage of types of buses based on infrastructures, traffic flows, and cost of operating, and not operate based on trademark for company.</p>
              <p>Bendies put SMRT operations into a very bad shape, overcrowded depots, jamming of roads/bus stops/bus interchanges which delays timings of other buses and all passengers, burned buses which decrease fleet counts, etc. Anyway, other than 190 and poor frequency services, bendies are not fully utilised all the times and takes up twice road space as a double decker and single decker.</p>
              <p>Thus it will be a smart move for SMRT to switch to double deckers and no bendies in the long run. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for more bus services in the north side, SMRT can't even provide better bus services over there after such a long time. They do not have enough resources to even improve the current ones they have. Somemore they are facing a lot of shit on the recent MRT breakdowns. Go improve their MRT first. Let SBST contribute some bus service improvements over there.</p>

              <p>It's already impossible SBST contribute at the northern side since the upcoming simpang new town SMRT is taking over.</p>
              <p>Double deckers is a trouble for SBST...overcrowding so i rather SMRT still use bendies than using DDs but somehow DDs and bendies have its own good points and bad points so you can't say smrt didn't make full use of bendies they are just reserves.But please,don't be so prejuiced to bendies,double deckers also have it own bad point..you think,if SMRT bought DDs deployed on 190 and other high demands services,will it solve the problem?no definitely not.Bendies delays?think properly the reason why it delays time...becuase WE singaporeans taking our own sweet time to board on the bus.thats why i cause delays.</p>
