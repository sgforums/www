              <p>SBST don't have to contribute all services over there but introduce a few more services over there. Please don't confuse.</p>
              <p>Overcrowding, are you sure??? If so, it goes the same for bendies as well since they carry only around 10 more passengers than a normal double decker. Overcrowding happens when the frequency of buses isn't so good for the service and/or no supplementary services to support or divert the demand. At least for sure, double deckers don't take up extra space in small bus stops and don't cause delays for sure.</p>
              <p>If SMRT use double deckers for 190, think of how many buses behind can stop in the bus bay instead of 2 bendy buses hogging the bus bay and bus stops??? Sorry but I had seen and experience many times that these bendy buses causing delay to other buses behind and jams up traffic junctions and busy roads. Think of how many more higher capacity buses that SMRT can buy if they choose double deckers over bendies, based on the space that their bus depots have. Many services like 980, 960, 190, 851 can easily have their overcrowding problems solved with more higher capacity buses they own. So SMRT should seriously consider converting to double deckers to provide better bus services.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>As for your last point, even if it is not the fault of the Singaporeans, then how about those faulty EZ link card readers or tourists asking for directions???</p>

              <p>I mean, after all, SBST serves my area and I'm glad for that. I won't swop my 88 DDs for anything in the world. </p>

              <p>72 is the worst crawler I've seen. The amount of time I wasted when I took this service is disgusting. Coupled with the huge night-time crowd + lousy frequency makes it the nightmare service.</p>
              <p>I should also add that just about any bus transferred to 72 becomes junk in a short while. Its a strange phenomenon seriously. <img style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>It is one of the slowest services I have ever taken. The drivers never/rarely exceed 50km/h even when the road is clear. Best part is that driving at such a slow speed they still end up early (red light on the DDU).</p>
              <p>109's timetable might also need to be revised - it almost always ends up early at Serangoon Int and the ride there is torturously slow sometimes. Double-deckers could come in handy during peak hours when the load is so high riding on the bus can become dangerous.</p>

              <p>I COMPLETELY AGREE that 72's timetable needs to be revised.</p>
              <p>It is one of the slowest services I have ever taken. The drivers
              never/rarely exceed 50km/h even when the road is clear. Best part
              is that driving at such a slow speed they still end up early (red
              light on the DDU).</p>

              <p>If they make the buses run faster, they can effectively remove
              the number of buses on the route right? Might be more complicated

              <p>The frequency can sometime fluctuate a lot - at the bus stop
              near my house it can range from 5 minutes to 20 minutes... but I
              have never seen 2 109s coming at the same time!</p>

              <p>Nono. Please don't give me back the 109 from those days.</p>
              <p>The frequency then was 20 min despite the chionging.</p>
              <p>As for 72, things got even worse after it was amended to make the loop to Hougang Int.</p>
