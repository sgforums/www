            <div class='col-md body'>
              1. SBST to get more double decker buses to ease the increasing commuter crowds in future, reducing the dependence of single deckers by at least 50%.
                              
              2. Reduce the run time for some SBST services to increase the speed of bueses to make the trips faster, like 10, 39, 72, 81, etc. Improve frequencies for more services as well.
                              
              3. More demonstrators from other European makes and exploring green technologies, like the Mercedes Benz Citaro fuel cell bus, Volvo 7700 and B5L hybrids, etc.
                              
              4. SBST to extend some services like:
              - 153 to Punggol northeast for links to Bukit Merah
              - 111 to Punggol northeast via partially along KPE for links to city and the west
              - 11 to Harbourfront via MBS southwards and Changi Airport eastwards via ECP after stadium, Eunos and Still road.
              - 135 to Sembawang for links to Marine Parade for Yishun and Sembawang residents via Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, Lentor Ave, Yishun Ave 2 and Sembawang Road.
              - 70 to Yishun for links to Paya Lebar, Serangoon and Geylang for Yishun residents.
                              
              to fully utilise the under-used services during off peaks.
                              
              5. SBST to introduce a new bus service from Northeast to Northwest (117 proposal), an express service from Punggol to city (like former 501, 502), an airport bus service to the west (possiblity of re extending 506 back to airport), a service from Woodlands to Clementi via Bukit Batok (maybe take over 173 and extend to Woodlands)
                              
              6. Introduce guided bus system for SBST buses in parts of city areas where roads are very busy and crowded.
                              
              7. Completely ban new bendy/articulated buses in Singapore to ease jams along bus stops, bus interchanges and bus depots. Encourage use of double deckers instead. Optimizing space uses, increase efficiency and reduce waiting times.
                              
              8. SMRT buses to liquidate and shut down and bus operations are either transfered to SBST or a more competent bus operator. All Dennis Lances, Scania L113s, Nissan UDs, Hinos, DAFs, Mercedes Benz O405 CACs and MK1 bendy buses will be pharsed out. All bendy buses to be pharsed out within 5 years and replaced by new double deckers. Current former SMRT buses will be reconditioned by the new bus company or SBST.
                          
              SMRT taxis sold to Transcab.
                              
              9. Services under former SMRT bus will be amended:
              - 858 to either restore to former Woodlands to Changi Airport via Yishun only route or spilt into 858-Yishun to Changi Airport, current Woodlands to Yishun to be merged and amended with 962.
              - 966 to cut back to Bukit Panjang. Deleted sector from Woodlands to Bukit Panjang to be covered by 963.
              - 77 and 106 to merge and form new service, which will be the trunk version of 971E.
              - SBST to extend 187 to Sembawang.
                              
              10. Government reliance for rail as backbone should be shifted to buses instead. Because if the whole rail system breaks down, buses are still the way to go for the public transport system. Rail is not fail proof and reliable and is not flexible at all.
                  Root of the problem: Still the problem lies with overcrowding in this country.

              <p>1. <span>SBST</span> to get more double decker buses to ease the increasing commuter crowds in future, reducing the dependence of single deckers by at least 50%.</p>
              <p>2. Reduce the run time for some <span>SBST</span> services to increase the speed of bueses to make the trips faster, like 10, 39, 72, 81, etc. Improve frequencies for more services as well.</p>
              <p>3. More demonstrators from other European makes and exploring green technologies, like the Mercedes Benz Citaro fuel cell bus, Volvo 7700 and <span>B5L</span> hybrids, etc.</p>
              <p>4. <span>SBST</span> to extend some services like:<br>- 153 to Punggol northeast for links to Bukit Merah<br>- 111 to Punggol northeast via partially along <span>KPE</span> for links to city and the west<br>- 11 to Harbourfront via <span>MBS</span> southwards and Changi Airport eastwards via <span>ECP</span> after stadium, Eunos and Still road.<br>- 135 to Sembawang for links to Marine Parade for Yishun and Sembawang residents via Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, Lentor Ave, Yishun Ave 2 and Sembawang Road.<br>- 70 to Yishun for links to Paya Lebar, Serangoon and Geylang for Yishun residents.</p>
              <p>to fully utilise the under-used services during off peaks.</p>
              <p>5. <span>SBST</span> to introduce a new bus service from Northeast to Northwest (117 proposal), an express service from Punggol to city (like former 501, 502), an airport bus service to the west (possiblity of re extending 506 back to airport), a service from Woodlands to Clementi via Bukit Batok (maybe take over 173 and extend to Woodlands)</p>
              <p>6. Introduce guided bus system for <span>SBST</span> buses in parts of city areas where roads are very busy and crowded.</p>
              <p>7. Completely ban new bendy/articulated buses in Singapore to ease jams along bus stops, bus interchanges and bus depots. Encourage use of double deckers instead. Optimizing space uses, increase efficiency and reduce waiting times.</p>
              <p>8. <span>SMRT</span> buses to liquidate and shut down and bus operations are either transfered to <span>SBST</span> or a more competent bus operator. All Dennis Lances, Scania L113s, Nissan UDs, Hinos, DAFs, Mercedes Benz <span>O405</span> CACs and <span>MK1</span> bendy buses will be pharsed out. All bendy buses to be pharsed out within 5 years and replaced by new double deckers. Current former <span>SMRT</span> buses will be reconditioned by the new bus company or <span>SBST</span>.</p>
              <p><span>SMRT</span> taxis sold to Transcab.</p>
              <p>9. Services under former <span>SMRT</span> bus will be amended:<br>- 858 to either restore to former Woodlands to Changi Airport via Yishun only route or spilt into 858-Yishun to Changi Airport, current Woodlands to Yishun to be merged and amended with 962.<br>- 966 to cut back to Bukit Panjang. Deleted sector from Woodlands to Bukit Panjang to be covered by 963.<br>- 77 and 106 to merge and form new service, which will be the trunk version of 971E.<br>- <span>SBST</span> to extend 187 to Sembawang.</p>
              <p>10. Government reliance for rail as backbone should be shifted to buses instead. Because if the whole rail system breaks down, buses are still the way to go for the public transport system. Rail is not fail proof and reliable and is not flexible at all. Root of the problem: Still the problem lies with overcrowding in this country.</p>

              <p>For Pt 4: I think 82 &amp; 107 merge better as it gives PGL a direct link to CBD when NEL fails.</p>
              <p>Pt 9: 77/106 and 971E serve different markets. Suggestion is virtually impossible to carry out.</p>
              <p>Bring back route 148 as a EUN-BNV service, covering its former route between BNV and Chinatown, then via Suntec City, National Stadium, Marine Parade &amp; Still Rd.</p>
