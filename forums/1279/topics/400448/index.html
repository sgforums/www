              <p>Hi there,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I 've recently moved to Sembawang Drive and is getting really tired of commuting by train to Shenton Way each morning. Can anyone advise if the Bus 640 is still available?</p>
              <p>If yes, can I board it across the Sembawang MRT - bus stop?</p>

              <p>Service 640 is a Scheme B bus service which used to run all the way to the far end of Admiralty Road West (Marsiling area there). However its route has been cut (illegally or not, I'm not too sure) such that buses now start running only from Canberra Road.</p>
              <p>Do not be surprised if you have to stand in the bus even on its return journeys from Tanjong Pagar MRT in the evening peak hours. With a max fare of only $1.10 and a shorter journey time compared to SMRT 167 (it goes past National Library, Little India and KK Hospital instead of Orchard Road), it's not surprising people are willing to pack into the coaches for a cheap cold ride home.</p>
              <p>And like 167, majority of the passengers will alight along Thomson/Upper Thomson Roads.</p>

              <p><br>Well you can say it is i guess.. As long as you board the bus from the first few stops along Canberra Road and from the International Plaza bus stop for the return journey, you should be assured of a seat. No guarantees for the other stops though.</p>

              <p>640.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I take 640 as and when I can if I go home late from school. Board from Thomson all the way to Canberra Ave. Fast and smooth. And 60c is okay, I guess. I malas to wait for the packed 980. I remember there's a Volvo coach in SC Classic body. Have never taken it before &gt;.&gt;</p>
              <p>Fare is 60c to $1.10, which is pretty damn cheap. Also, during PM peak most of the buses will have some show on the TV inside, though it's in Mandarin :P</p>
              <p>From what I remember, any stop at Sembawang Road will have very little chance to have seat in morning peak, because by the time it reaches Canberra Ave bus stop, very few seats left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, to vivi_gal, walk to any bus stop with 856 that is heading to Yishun at around 7am. The earlier buses should have more chance for seats.</p>

              <p>I was personally surprised that the bus stop pole showed 640, because ever since I started taking 640 back in 2000, I don't remember 640 going to ADM Road West.</p>
              <p>But over there no business leh. Marsiling maybe have, but a bit long to express.</p>

              Actually,  bus service 640 is a good bus service, if you are not in a hurry, board this bus and you still save money on each trip. I wonder if this bus service operates on Sat these days?? And what are the timings like??
