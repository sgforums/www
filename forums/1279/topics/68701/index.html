            <div class='col-md body'>Today, I boarded SBS Bus 83 on my way home at about 8:30 PM. While I was paying my bus fare, I realised the value in my EZ Link card had been used up. So I took a sit first, the very front sit beside the bus driver to look for coins. However, the bus driver keep calling me. He said " Hello, hello, hello. " Apparently, he is rushing me to pay. This made me felt very embarrassed. I was sitting right beside him, couldn't he see I am searching for coins. In the end, I payed a $1 coin. I feel very embarrassed and unhappy about this incident, what can I do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, let me relate an incident which I encountered on my way home from school just 3 days ago on Service 18.<br><br>I boarded the bus at Tampines Interchange, and along the way (can't remember which bus stop), a Chinese man in his 30s boarded the bus. He tapped his card at the entrance reader but the error beep sounded. He tapped again but no sound came from the reader. So off he went to find a seat. But then, the driver, unaware of what ACTUALLY happened, called up the man and asked him to come up and tapped the card again. The man hesitantly came up and tapped the card. BUT! Instead of going back to his seat, the man repeatedly tapped his card on the reader, as to show his unhappiness with the driver's attitude. Gosh, that was hilarious. As for the driver, he can't be bothered and continued his journey to Bedok.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>
