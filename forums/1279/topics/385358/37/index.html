I don't mean buses that got into serious accidents or being 'cooked' or whatsoever.<br><br>Conclusion :<br>Think before you talk.<br>Before you talk, think.<br>Don't spill any rubbish from your mouth that is a rubbish collector from facebook.<br>Please at least recycle them before giving it out free.<br>Nobody likes free rubbish that worth nothing.<br>Or just go and play your clone wars at Mars.<br>Facebook, over 30% of it's contents are fake.<br>How can you just believe that the crappy things you <br>'observe' or 'overheard' are of the 70%'s side?<br>Didn't you considered it being in the 30%'s side?<br>Even if you didn't, please press the button inside your brain to brainwash<br>you off your 'earworm' tumor in it.<br>I guess of all you heard,<br>only 20% of it is true.<br>The rest? You spilled them out without official evidence.<br>At least prove to us that you didn't photocopy from facebook.<br>Like what you learnt at school.<br>Summary writing, synoyms, autonymns...<br>What are they on Earth for? To enter and get stuck in your eardrum whilst<br>the crappy nonsenses got onto your mouth?<br>Please.<br>For goodness sake.<br>Be a normal person.<br>Don't be a person like some STOMPERS that even stomp that<br>Extra Professional Mints got some black dots on it<br>just to receive $50.<br>Where the black dots are just simply your black permanent marker's ink.<br>Don't be a Squid that sprays ink all over the face of someone's elses.<br>Don't be a Dog that barks all day long when nobody even know why are they barking<br>for.<br>Don't be a Cat that just sleeps all day long, choosing nothing to change their method of living.<br>Please try something new. The scania k230ubs aren't as bad as you think. <br>Rather, I think they even won those crappy citaros.<br>So, choose a path that will change your life.<br>Not just stealing lies from facebook and print them out here.<br>That won't get you any money.<br>So PLEASE, CHOOSE.</p>
