              <p>I need more time to observe over the next few weekdays though. Although I wouldn't be surprised if they are back to only 1 non-WAB slot, which was the scenario before 8419A left 359 for 354, and 359 got back 607B in return from 354, to pair with 858T.

              <p>Don't ever think 359 will ever have Citaro perms. There hasn't been any Citaro cameos on 359 yet too.

              <p>Yeah. Even after SBS6150L who has additional rear air-con vents, the Konveta air-con on the roof of the bus is still unable to supply enough fresh crispy cold air, especially on a hot day.

              <p>It's <strong>HIGH TIME</strong> that every one is getting
              annoyed with these clones who keep on spamming this forum with
              posts that eventually makes no sense at all. In fact, there's no
              sense at all at what they are posting in the first place! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>One does not simply just wish that old buses get
              scrapped immidiately and wants new buses to come in as and when
              they like. </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First and foremost, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> own the bus
              company. </p>
              <p>Secondly, you take the bus that arrives at the bus stop, whether
              you like it or not. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, bus companies will replace the old buses with newer
              buses in due time. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be damn lucky that you're living in Singapore and not
              countries like Bangladesh or Sri Lanka, for instance. Compare our
              buses with theirs and you'll see the difference. You don't go whine
              like some sore loser about this service <strong>NOT WAB</strong> or
              this service keeps <strong>GETTING OLDER BUSES</strong>. Bus
              Operators know what are they doing. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If they keep on throwing new buses
              around, where are the older buses being dumped at? Your
              house? </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Mark III may have left us, but think about those memories
              made in those buses. You don't get to make those memories like you
              did in those older buses. Let those old buses retire with
              glory. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, getting to the point.</p>
              <p><strong>Imagine a hot sunny day</strong> and you see a
              <strong>Citaro and a KUB</strong>, <strong>which one would you
              choose? A Vibrator with Great aircon or a bus with narrow space to
              stand and super pathetic aircon? </strong>You decide. For me,
              i'd chose the KUB. I get free massage and great aircon unlike
              Citaros where i can just sweat and it will take forever for me to
              feel cold in the bus. </p>
              <p> </p>
