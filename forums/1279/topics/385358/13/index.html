              <p><br>Most of the MKIV DMs use the THD101GC.</p>
              <p>That's a guess, based on general performance characteristics. And it would appear that a minority are actually fitted with the THD102KF.</p>
              <p>Nor is it accurate I guess, to conclude that the Voith MKIVs are<em> all </em>4 speed types and utilising the THD101GC.</p>
              <p>Basically the original 115 strong fleet appears to be quite an oddball with different combinations of engines and gearboxes, although the majority use the THD101GC coupled to the ZF4 gearbox.</p>

              <p>Queen St terminal is accessible by K230UBs. there is an employee bus that passes by there.</p>
              <p>new and fresh buses getting scratched on first day ops is a moot point. buses are bound to get scrapes and dings anyway, its a matter of time.</p>
              <p>if you realise, by putting the DM3500s, which have about 5-7 years of lifespan left on 160 and 170, you would have to undertake the fleet replacement exercise again. isn't that double work? throwing K230UBs early on and leaving them for a longer period would be less hassle. you think registering buses with the Malaysian authorities is that simple ah?</p>

              <p>please wake up from your fantasy dreamworld! Malaysian taxis are restricted to ply only to Queen St in Singapore but can go anywhere else in Malaysia, as for Singapore taxis they can pick and drop off at any part of SG but are restricted to 1 location in JB. And the taxi charges are a flat fee so what taxicab charges are there to speak of?!</p>

              <p><br>Hmm... Not so sure about HGDEP. It seemed that HGDEP was the only depot to have both Volvo B57s and Merc OF1417s, the rest only have 1 of a kind. I remembered taking Merc OF1417 NZMB on service 61 in 1993 (cannot be from BBDEP side).</p>
