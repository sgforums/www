              <p>Aarrghh! Why do you have to keep doing this?

              <p>In the first place (I suppose you know this as well), you are not suppose to post this nonsense in this thread even though you may find me annoying, because by doing this, you are the one to be doing the wrong thing here. How would you feel yourself if I or anyone else (for example) do the same thing to you as well? Will you be happy even if you did this thing? Can you bear the consequences of it?</p>
              <p>Now, some people might think that I created clone accounts. I shall make my stand here that I did not create any. I believe there are more than one person who created the clone accounts to frame me, not only SMB228X himself.</p>
              <p>I shall just end my note here. I don't wish to argue any further, but what I want is just an apology for all these wrongdoings.</p>

              <p>So if you want to shoot others, think whether your reliability and trustworthiness was even intact in the first place or not. People here don't shoot you for no reason if you're reliable and trustworthy. If they do shoot you, that means you faltered somewhere and irritated the rest of us along the way. Just my thoughts.</p>

              <p>So, next time before you click the "save reply" button, please look thru what you've written and think thru if it is worthy of the bandwidth it's going to consume.

              <p>He wouldn't need to imagine others doing that to him because
              lemon has all along been posting sensible information and comments.
              You clearly do not see him poking other sensible users posting well
              thought out information/replies which are constructive and
              informative.</p>
              <p>So, next time before you click the "save reply" button, please
              look thru what you've written and think thru if it is worthy of the
              bandwidth it's going to consume. And hopefully you would not have
              to edit or delete your posts as frequently and "come back again
