            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, same for Sv. 79, a service which I forgot to mention. There is simply not enough space at Boon Lay for buses to park so a few services to Boon Lay actually loop there.</div>

A new feeder service from Yishun, Sv. 817 will be introduced and loops at Sembawang Rd End, this is the same situation for Sv. 82 as well.<br><br>Sv. 175 is an exception. It "supposedly" terminates at Lim Chu Kang, but it actually gets its drivers from Choa Chu Kang Interchange. The route should be amended so buses park at CCK instead of Lim Chu Kang, however following the same route. The route will call at CCK Interchange in both directions but at different boarding berths.</div></blockquote>Darryl, some people living in Sembawang is gonna complain like siao if you do that. Currently, the amended 167 is the bus that links Sembawang residents to Thomson and Orchard, and furthermore, it would greatly lengthen the travelling time if they had to bypass Yishun.</div>
