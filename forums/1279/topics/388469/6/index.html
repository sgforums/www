              <p>Two Singaporeans were in the courtroom yesterday clothed in orange overalls labelled “Cluster B”, cuffed, shackled and chained as they were brought back to court in the middle of their sentence to answer yet more charges for illegal assembly.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee Soon Juan and Mr Gandhi Ambalam are serving a one-week prison sentence after they were convicted for illegal assembly without a permit for distributing flyers critical of the PAP in 2006.</p>
              <p>In his verdict, District Judge Ch’ng Lye Beng said he agreed with the Prosecution that “distributing flyers in a group of 5 or more persons criticizing the PAP government’s policies is an offence.”</p>
              <p>Dr Chee and his colleagues from the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) had “distributed flyers at the Raffles City Shopping Centre on 10 September 2006 questioning the ministers’ salaries as well as the denial of political rights to Singaporeans,” according to the SDP’s website.</p>
              <p>Both defendants were still cuffed, shackled and chained when they entered the dock until District Judge Chia Wee Kiat order the cuffs to be removed though their ankles remained shackled and fastened to the bench like some hardcore criminals.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee’s sister Ms Chee Siok Chin then requested the judge to order the shackles on their feet removed as “these men posed absolutely no security threat whatsoever” after which  judge directed Mr. Gandhi and Dr. Chee to be placed in another dock that had bars all around it, and the restraints to be removed.</p>
              <p>The humiliating treatment dished out to Dr Chee and Mr Ambalam is in stark contrast to that received by <strong>a PRC family who “hijacked” a SBS Transit bus two days ago by refusing to leave it.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>They had boarded the bus without wheelchair accessibility at Mandai and was told by the bus captain that they were not allowed to bring the wheelchair up the bus due to safety reasons. However, they insisted on doing so and sat on the bus for 6 hours, making a din in it.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Though the police was called to the scene, they did not arrest them on the spot as they should have done so under the new Public Orders Act.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The police officers were later seen “escorting” them down the bus with one of them carrying their wheelchair to a Maxi-cab paid for by SBS to send them home.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is irony that legitimate political activities are being criminalized in Singapore as “illegal assembly” while foreigners who were obviously causing public nuisance and disorder were let off the hook just like that.</strong></p>

              <p>STOMPer<strong> iceblue </strong>was disgusted that the family who had caused a 5-hour standoff on board an SBS Transit bus was given a free ride home in a taxi. He feels they should have received a stiff penalty for their behaviour instead.<br><br>The family of four, comprising a Chinese national couple from Beijing, an elderly lady and her daughter (both Singaporean) as well as their maid were told by the bus captain to alight after they had brought a wheelchair on board the bus. <br><br>This was because the bus was not equipped with a padded wheelchair dock, which meant that transporting a wheelchair would have been unsafe for other commuters.<br><br>Here's what the STOMPer wrote in an email today (Jan 19):<br><br>"I was surprised to read an article in Wanbao yesterday about this family, including two members from China, who 'hijacked' a public bus for about 5 hours in Singapore, and was given a free taxi ride home by SBS Transit.  <br><br>"The family had wanted to board a bus near Mandai and was refused by the bus driver for bringing a wheelchair up on the bus due to safety concerns, as wheelchairs are a safety hazard and might injure others on the bus if there are no safety straps onboard.<br><br>"The family refused to alight and left other commuters stranded on the bus. <br><br>"The reason given by the PRC woman was that the bus did not have signs that forbid wheelchairs to be brought up.<br><br>"The bus captain had to call another bus in to transfer the other commuters to. <br><br>"I am amazed by SBS Transit's response in providing a free taxi ride home for the family to end the fiasco. <br><br>"The situation seems to have been mishandled. It just suggests one should make a fool out of yourself to have your requests granted. It sets a bad precedent.<br><br>"Clearly, in this scenario, the family had not only created a public nuisance, but also wasted taxpayer's money by activating the police and increase costs for the public transport operator. <br><br>"The police, should have taken action against the family instead.<br><br>"No wonder our public transport costs are increasing."</p>
