              <p><span class="time">January 18, 2010</span></p>
              <p>A PRC couple together with a 90 year old granny, a female friend and a maid boarded a SBS bus without wheelchair accessibility at Mandai and was told by the bus captain that they were not allowed to bring the wheelchair up the bus due to safety reasons. However, they insisted on doing so and sat on the bus for 6 hours, refusing to leave!</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21391" title="prcbus04" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/prcbus04.jpg" alt="prcbus04" width="560" height="184"></p>
              <p>The bus captain has no choice but to stop the bus along the road and after informing the SBS’s headquarters, transferred the other passengers alread aboard to another bus, but still the PRC family did not alight from the bus.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21392" title="prcbus03" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/prcbus03.jpg" alt="prcbus03" width="560" height="388"></p>
              <p>The police were alerted to the scene to settle the dispute to no avail. The five of them continued to cry, wail and scream on the bus that they want to go home.</p>
              <p>They kept complaining to the policemen:</p>
              <p><em>“We want to go home! We haven’t had lunch yet or gone to the loo! There are no buses now to go back, what should we do?”</em></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21393" title="prcbus01" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/prcbus01.jpg" alt="prcbus01" width="283" height="253">When interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao, 48 year old Madam Lin who worked in the media industry said angrily:</p>
              <p><em>“The bus did not put out any sign that forbid wheelchairs to be brought up and we did not commit any crime. So why was the bus stopped by the road and refused to fetch us home?”</em></p>
              <p>It is not revealed if Madam Lin is a new citizen, PR or foreigner, but since the couple are together with a maid, it is likely that they are PRs or new citizens living here in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Madam Lin eventually requested SBS to call a cab to send them home which it did by arranging a Maxi Cab for them free of charge which ended the 5 hour fiasco.</p>
              <p>This is the second time within a week that PRCs found themselves mired in controversy due to their public behavior which does not quite fit into the usual social etiquette of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Two days ago, Shin Min Daily published an article about an unruly PRC lady customer who walked off without paying her fare upon calling a cab and even lodged a police report against the taxi-driver who tried to ask her to pay up. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/17/singapore-taxi-driver-sacked-by-company-after-quarrel-with-prc-lady-customer-who-lodged-police-report-against-him/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>She subsequently made a formal complaint to the taxi company which terminated the services of the driver a few days later.</p>
              <p>On 16 January 2010, we reported the story of a PRC woman staging a solo “protest” at the Ministry of Education Headquarters at Buona Vista for the last two days to demand that MOE transfer her child to a top primary school in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Though MOE has already offered to place her child in another school in the vicinity she lives in, but she continues to insist that she be given a place in the school of her choice.</p>
              <p>She was reported to be in the MOE building till 12 midnight last night and only left after the police threatened her with arrest if she continues to loiter in a government building.

              <p>According to the latest update from our source:</p>
              <p><em>“The saga continues today too! Still hanging around with child in tow!!”</em></p>
              <p>Due to the ruling party’s liberal immigration policies, foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population with the significant proportion coming from mainland China.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s strongman Lee Kuan Yew said in a recent interview with The National Geographic magazine that it is a “good thing” for Singapore to welcome so many Chinese immigrants as they are more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving”.</p>
              <p>For once, Lee’s “prediction” is accurate: they are indeed more “hard-driving” than Singaporeans as the above examples have shown.</p>

              <p>Both Chinese tabloids Shin Min Daily and Lianhe Wanbao carried a report yesterday on a PRC family who insisted on boarding a SBS bus with a wheelchair though they were told by the bus captain not to do so due to safety reasons as the bus was not equipped with wheelchair accessibility facilities. (read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/18/prc-family-refused-to-leave-bus-sbs-paid-for-a-cab-to-send-them-home/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>They made a din on the bus for six hours before leaving in a cab paid for by SBS. The police was called to the scene, but they were unable to stop the public disturbance and allowed the saga to continue.</p>
              <p>Under the new Public Order Act introduced specifically to deal with such incidents, the police are vested with the power to “move” the offenders away from the scene.</p>
              <p>For some inexplicable reasons, the two police officers did not evoke the Public Order Act to stop the public unrest and was photographed to be reasoning with one of the PRC ladies and helping the elderly among them alight from the bus subsequently.</p>
              <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21404" title="prcbus02" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/prcbus02.jpg" alt="prcbus02" width="560" height="420"></p>
              <p><strong>[Above: Singapore police officers "escorting" the PRC offenders]</strong></p>
              <p>When interviewed by Lianhe Wanbao, 48 year old Madam Lin who worked in the media industry said angrily:</p>
              <p><em>“The bus did not put out any sign that forbid wheelchairs to be brought up and we did not commit any crime. So why was the bus stopped by the road and refused to fetch us home?”</em></p>
              <p>Madam Lin and her family had already committed a crime if not a series of crimes – they can be charged for a variety of offences under the Public Order and Nuisance Act (Chapter 184) such as causing harassment, alarm or distress to others, making excessive noise in public and of riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour, each amounting to a fine of no more than S$1,000.</p>
              <p>If they were Singaporeans, they would probably be arrested on the spot and taken away for “obstructing” the police from discharging their duties, let alone allowed to continue their nonsense on the bus for so long.</p>
              <p>From this and previous cases, the Singapore police appears to dish out preferential treatment to foreigners.</p>
              <p>When over 200 PRC workers protested outside the Ministry of Manpower last year for unpaid wages, the police was seen standing around them and not taking any action.</p>
              <p>However, when two Singaporeans – Seelan Palay and Chiong Kai Xiong stood outside the same compound to protest against the deportation of their Burmese friends by the ruling party, they were arrested on the spot and taken away by the Singapore police within thirty minutes.</p>
              <p>Similarly a PRC woman was allowed to “protest” at the Ministry of Education headquarters last week for the entire day till midnight demanding its staff to transfer her daughter to a top primary school. The police could have arrested her immediately to stop the ugly fiasco, but again did not do so.</p>
              <p>Yet five Singaporeans were arrested for “illegal procession” when all they did was to walk in a group from one point to another in public. The case is still ongoing after three years. Though a District Judge had already acquitted them, the Attorney-General Chambers found fit to lodge an appeal against the decision.</p>
              <p>The Singapore police is extremely efficient when dealing with locals, especially if they happen to fall on the wrong end of the political divide. But when it comes to foreigners, they seem pretty lost on what to do like how they allowed a prime suspect in the double hit and run accident at Bukit Panjang last month to “slip” through its dragnet.</p>
              <p>Such police inaction and impotence will only serve to embolden foreigners in Singapore who may get the wrong impression that as long they make “noise”, they will be able to get away with almost anything in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Singapore police should remember that they are paid by Singapore taxpayers to serve the interests of the public and not to protect the foreigners.</p>
              <p>In this example, more than 10 passengers, some of whom were Singaporeans had to be transferred to another bus just because of the silly antics of this PRC family which could be prevented in the first had the police decided to take action against them.</p>
              <p>Not only did they get away with the crime, they were even “compensated” with a free taxi trip home by SBS with the Singapore police “serving” as “road usherers” to help them down the bus and “escort” them to the taxi, making a mockery of the “rule of law” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is highly unlikely that this PRC household who caused disruption to public transport and inconvenience to other commuters will be charged by the Singapore police. In fact, it will not be surprising at all if the Singapore Police were to send them a letter of “apology” to soothe their frayed nerves.</p>

              <p>Didn't SBST already say that they will not allow wheelchairs on non-WAB buses?</p>
              <p>But apparently they didn't make it clear enough. If not, there would not be any reason for the family to say "There is no rule that prevents us from bringing wheelchairs onto such a bus" or something to that tune.</p>

              <p>Didn't SBST already say that they will not allow wheelchairs on non-WAB buses?</p>
              <p>But apparently they didn't make it clear enough. If not, there would not be any reason for the family to say "There is no rule that prevents us from bringing wheelchairs onto such a bus" or something to that tune.</p>
