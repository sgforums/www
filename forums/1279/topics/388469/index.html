              a non-WAB SBS bus, although the bus driver dun allow them to board

              <p>Incident happened at Mandai Road near Mandai crematorium

              <p>This is not the way to handle the case. <br>SBST should have just let the police handle the case. <br>Charge them under public disturbance. <br>lucky they were travelling in grp of 5 ppl. <br>if not lagi best..<br>can charge them under rioting.</p>
              <p>Why still give them a free taxi ride home ? i simply dont understand. <br>Its like trying to send a message to ppl that u will get a free taxi ride after 5hrs (if u can managed to stay that long inside a bus.)</p>
              <p>This is what happens when u let in so many people from the north. Just becase they are set to be the next superpower. Just becase they are getting richer and able to go to other parts of the world. Just because they think that they are the best in everything...<br>This is what u will get from them. <br><br>Whats next ? <br>A china family who will try to hog a train ???</p>

              <p>SBST being too nice. Cannot board means cannot board and this group of chao-ah-lians make a big fuss out of it. Should throw them (especially the 48-year-old woman) into jail for disturbing the public and SBST should charge them for their loss in revenue as a result of 1 bus not being able to operate for 5 hours!</p>
              <p>Wonderful actions ah China people, make me so disgusted at you.</p>

              <p>I dont see the reason why folded wheelchair cannot be brought onboard the bus. (same logic as folder bicyle which can be brought into the buses)? It is not passenger sitted in wheel chair. Can some enlighten on this? The explaination by Tammy Tan in the press is not very convincing..</p>

              <p>Based on Singapore's situation, I can understand the fact that its very inconvenient for the driver to allow such a situation to happen. Being the fact that we have not ironed out the details for WAB services, pointing that some services with partial/full WAB fleet are not designated WAB routes, we would face further level of problems with the question: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'Are wheelchairs allowed on board non-WAB buses?'</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Wheelchair as an item should be allowed on board, however, when it comes across the to the point that the person cannot get off the wheelchair and board the bus, meaning that he is disabled, what would operators choose to do? Refuse entry strictly, or transport the disabled person out of humanity? Both choices will have consequences and backfire from either party.</p>
              <p>I am interested to ask fellow forumnite Dave (Powered_by_CNG) if he has came across a situation below (or rather, does it happen in Australia).</p>
              <p>In <strong>Japan</strong>, due to the Barrier-Free law, <strong>all buses are required to</strong>, when flagged, to <strong>carry wheelchair bound persons</strong>, regardless if its a bus <strong>with or without ramp</strong>. One step, two steps, three steps or even coaches, all are required to carry without fail. Hence this created a problem, drivers of buses not too old, take our O405 as an example, have to carry the person with the wheelchair up the bus. Now you must say that is a back-breaking job, and there are lots of complains from drivers who do this.</p>
              <p>In 2002, a woman took to court her case against Osaka City for compensation of 2,000,000 JPY when she endured insults from 4 different bus drivers for taking a high-floor bus. 3 insults were made when the driver was carrying her up the bus, which included 'Why are you taking this bus and not 'non-step' (low entry/low floor) buses or buses with ramps?'. One driver told her 'You cannot get on. Wait for a lift-bus (bus with electric ramp) or 'non-step' bus' and drove off. Bus operators also have a lot to say about buses without barrier-free facilities as their bus captains face health problems with backaches and potential damage to backbone.</p>
              <p>Article in Japanese <a href="http://response.jp/article/2004/02/04/57569.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>Don't say this will not happen here; this issue just came up two days ago and regardless of nationality, China India or European, I think we should look on the final issue, <strong>whether wheelchairs are allowed on non-WAB buses</strong>.</p>
              <p>When replying please be constructive. I do not want this to blow up into a disabled persons issue simply because I do not appreciate disrespect to disabled persons. They are entitled their rights of speech as well so please do listen out to different views before making your own, and moderate where necessary.</p>
