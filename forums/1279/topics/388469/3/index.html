              <p>To get back to the topic of whether bringing folded wheelchairs up on board non WAB buses, I think that it really makes no sense for SBST and LTA to ban folded wheelchairs on non WAB buses.</p>
              <p>Even before the airport services turned WAB, and way even before the airport services got KUBs, some commuters on board services like 27, and especially 36, were already bringing up huge check-in luggages on board the Volvo Mk4s, and there was no problem when they did that, provided that they didn't block the aisles and what not with their luggages.</p>
              <p>If such luggages were allowed, then why not folded wheelchairs? We are talking about folded wheelchairs only, and not the wheelchair bound passengers. For example, if someone were to go out and buy a wheelchair and take public transport home, then in that case, how?</p>
              <p>Something to think about: if a Singaporean instead of a foreigner caused such a disturbance, would they have been able to walk free? Or even get a free Maxicab ride?</p>

              <h1>Netizens slammed PRC family for “hijacking” SBS bus and Singapore police for its inaction</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 19, 2010</span></p>
              <p>The recent “hijacking” of a SBS Transit bus by a PRC family of five caused a massive outroar in cyberspace with many netizens lampooning their antics and police inaction against them.</p>
              <p>The family was not allowed to carry their wheelchair to board the bus due to safety reasons as it is not wheelchair accessible. Though the bus captain had explained to them earlier, they refused to bulge and went up the bus.</p>
              <p>The bus captain had no choice but to park the bus alongside a road and after consulting his superiors, transferred the other passengers in the bus to another one.</p>
              <p>The PRC family continued to protest vehemently on the bus for five hours and even the police who arrived later was unable to do anything about it. The fiasco was settled eventually when SBS paid a cab to send them home.</p>
              <p>The ugly saga made a mockery of the ruling party’s much criticized “foreign talent” policy and its vain attempts to “integrate” the new citizens, many of whom hail from mainland China into Singapore society.</p>
              <p>Netizens were up in arms when hearing the story with more than 50 comments posted on The Temasek Review in less than three hours questioning why they were not arrested on the spot for unruly behavior.</p>
              <p><strong>WTF</strong> wrote:</p>
              <p><em>“If they were singaporeans, we can bet your last dollar that the Singapore foolish force will have them arrested for disorderly behaviour.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>Myanmar not welcomed</strong> added:</p>
              <p><em>“Shouldn’t these people be hauled to the police station for disorderly behaviour? If they were Singaporeans, they would have been arrested immediately by the police. What the hell is wrong with the police these days? Only know how to bully Singaporeans? Police, shame on you!”</em></p>
              <p><strong>BiasedGovt</strong> was peeved with SBS for paying their cab fare:</p>
              <p><em>“Why paid the taxi fare for the PRC? If they are our citizens, we are already locked up by police. Because PRC are è¿‡æ±ŸçŒ›(å‡¶)é¾™?”</em></p>
              <p>Some netizens made use of this incident to criticize the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy which is destroying Singapore bit by bit.</p>
              <p>An anonymous poster said:</p>
              <p>“Remember this type of behaviour has happened in MOE and the next place it could happen is hospitals where someone urgently needed tranfusion to save his/her life and a bunch of street tough hooligans obstructing A &amp; Es regardless of lives at risk and the Police cowered in fearful submission. Do we really want to integrate another 3 million of the same behaviour type into our society? I would say seriously “No thanks” Any law-abiding Singaporeans disagree?”</p>
              <p><strong>Wat?</strong> felt the ruling party will get a “taste” of its own medicine one day:</p>
              <p><em>“The MIW will regret the day they decide to import all these people in thinking they will vote for them. these people are more trouble to the MIW than MIW thinks. There you go …. “hard-driving” ones for you. i would like to see more of them making a fuss of everything and putting up protests and the whole she-bang. Good times are coming!”</em></p>
              <p>Over at SPH-owned Hardwarezone forum, the topic sparked an active discussion among netizens on the aggressive behavior of these “Ah Tiongs”, a derogatory Hokkien term for mainland Chinese.</p>
              <p><strong>leaving_footsteps</strong> disagreed with their antics:</p>
              <p><em>“Can charge them for protesting without permit bo? Anyway, I think they should have complained through other means lor. Causing trouble for other passengers ish really too much. Aren’t they too self-centred and selfish?”</em></p>
              <p><strong>Lao_funker</strong> thought they were ridiculous:</p>
              <p>“<em>This is a bit ridiculous. Many different buses of the same number would have stopped at that bus stop over a period of 5 hrs. I don’t really get it – what kind of moron would tussle with the same bus driver for 5 hrs instead of choosing another bus with the same number ?”</em></p>
              <p><strong>poolzz</strong> was obviously infuriated after reading the article:</p>
              <p><em>“After reading this thread, I hate Ah Tiongs more ! ! !  Go back to ur country . Don’t come to Singapore to take our jobs.”</em></p>
              <p>The ruling party has resorted to mass importing foreigners from overseas, especially China to boost Singapore’s declining birth rates over the last few years.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Singapore is not getting the best talents from China who prefers to emigrate to the U.S., France, Canada, Australia and South Korea and we end up, but uncouth peasants from the poorer inland provinces instead. </p>
              <p>With more and more of them flooding Singaporeans, it is little wonder that MM Lee is concerned that native Singaporeans, who are described by SM Goh as “sheep” will be unable to compete with these more “hard-driving” and “hard-striving” “lions”.</p>
