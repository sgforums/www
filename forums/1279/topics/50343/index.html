MAybe TIB 715 turned out to be a snail that day, but the other DAFs, especially TIB719T and TIB712, are much faster than the LAnce 211s. I guess that the speed limiter buzzer comes on at about 50 kmh, and in the morning and afternoon, the buzzer is on for most of the stretch in the 2 roads. All I can say that is that the DAFs are speedy buses in the hands of the right driver, and its  a pity ( or is it Thank Goodness? ) that most of these drivers are  driving the DAFs, not the LAnces. For example, TIB 1008 was practically crawling along Lornie yesterday evening at 2nd gear, and no, I did not count the gear wrongly, and by the time it reached the MAcRitchie bus stop, a 165 Strider and 855 MB0405 had already zoomed past it. The Volvo 2-Ax that was in front was also nowhere to be seen. To add to the discomfort, the bus was packed and I was standing</div>
