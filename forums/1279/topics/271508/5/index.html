However, both bus services are chopped. I still can rmb the days when they pass by Sengkang, Hougang and my Serangoon Nth area. Especially for 502, it provides a direct link from my hse to Orchard, Clementi and Boon Lay. Sigh!!

In the article, the author talked about the ERP gantries seemed ineffective in curbing the problem of traffic congestion because he said that the increase in price is too insignificant for motorists to give up driving.<br><br>Imagine one day that in order to deter people from driving, the ERP went up to $14 bucks as stated in the article, will ERP implemented now as $14 deter motorists from driving?<br><br>For me, I think it will.<br>However, there will surely be many feedbacks from the ground.</div>
