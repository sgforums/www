I dun think it will be that long. From BP int to Jelapang Rd, there are 13 stops and 9 traffic junctions that the svc will pass by. Suppose if the bus needs 2 mins from stop to stop + boarding of passengers and 0.5 min for every traffic junction, the total time will be around 30.5 mins. Besdies, the freq of 920 is on the range 15 - 21 mins. It already occupies half of the travel time to Jelapang Rd.<br><br>Anyway, u can take LRT to Jelapang which takes only 2 mins as claimed by Transitlink Bus Guide 2007.</div>
