Seems like all SMRT controlled areas except BB are being complained here. SBS does not only choose the shortest route for buses to get through estates. Instead, some buses will make a small detour to ply other main roads, like 57/59 through tp, 154 through Yung ho etc. Maybe its time to hand over bus services for SBS to handle.</div>

Anyway, I agree with you in some ways. SBST has planned the routes rather well. However, if you talk about night rider service, SMRT one is more established and the routes plied by all the 8 NRs are planned pretty well although they go round and round to pass by the housing estates.</div>

Is it no right turn allowed at the junction? Cos from what I see at the junction in The Street Directory, it looks normal.  Anyway, this is one of my earliest fantasised bus routes created before 52. How is it? I am just thinking that there would be more demand if it is extended to Hougang.</div>

Seems like all SMRT controlled areas except BB are being complained here. SBS does not only choose the shortest route for buses to get through estates. Instead, some buses will make a small detour to ply other main roads, like 57/59 through tp, 154 through Yung ho etc. Maybe its time to hand over bus services for SBS to handle.</div></blockquote>The reason why BB sees less complain is because where SMRT doesn't provide a direct link, SBS buses are willing to serve them. There are a total of 4 services serving the town: 66, 157, 174 &amp; 506. These services are left behind by legacy arising from the 1999 great swap between TIBS and SBS for control over Sengkang/Punggol and Choa Chu Kang/Bt Batok.</div>
