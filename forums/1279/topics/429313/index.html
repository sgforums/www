                  What's the WP's reasoning on these?
                  Can merging both SBST and SMRT able to provide better services?
                  Off-peak travel fare; its easy to simply say reduce fares, introduce bigger concessions etc to win peoples hearts. But in reality, how is WP going to ensure the bus companies still remain commercially viable?
                  Assistant driver on all train and buses? Do they mean having an assistant on every bus just like the long-distance Malaysia coaches? Who's going to pay for the additional huge salary expenditures? In Singapore doing this? I think its crazy! I think Singapore's opposition parties still cannot make it. They only know how to criticise and unable to provide a good win-win solution. And till now, I've yet to see an opposition candidate who can stand in front and say if he/she is elected, he is capable of going overseas to negotiate and clinch business deals for the good of Singapore, and he can further spur the economy, open the doors of Singapore to foreign investments further and do it better than our current govt.

              <p>Better if two conflicting interests continue to compete each other, it will continue to bring efficiencies through improvements to outdo each other. The communters are the ones who benefits. Of course, they have to continue to look into profits and efficiency but not the expense of quality.</p>

              <p>2nd point makes no difference as it is still under the same management and thus the inefficiency of operations still continues. Just sell the bus operations back to SBST and probably the cab operations to Transcab.</p>
              <p>I have thought of setting up a 3rd bus operator in the past. However, based on the market share bus operations are having now, it might be better to have one operator will do. The bus market is small in Singapore and having too many operators will result in the market share too small for each operator and in the long term, recurring losses/with little profits, because of small scale operations for each operator. In the end, some players will just leave the market becuase market is too small to survive.</p>

              <p><br>I doubt that future rail projects can handle the growth of population in future. There is still need of buses to bring the masses and to reduce the loads from rails. Moreover buses are more flexible to plan and schedule and Singapore can't just build rail everywhere in future once there are too many infrastructure underground and consider the soil structures that can hold the weight of structures above ground. The share market might become smaller but still viable if there is a single operator to serve.</p>

              <p><br>that is a very microscopic view you have. Just because they dont visit you, you dont vote for them. If PAP dont visit you then you might as well spoil your vote if that's the case?</p>
              <p>Instead of them visiting you why not you try to reach out to them instead? Find out about their walkabout details or their rallies. Even if its not your own area's rallies you can visit them at Kallang Ave tml (unless u are in Moulmein-Kallang).</p>
              <p>If you think covering 150 blocks in your area is easy, think again. and if you manage to finish that in 9 days, that would be crazily impossible. Dont forget they still have rallies to attend and give speeches, prepare them and other misc work which the media doesnt cover.</p>
