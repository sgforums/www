              <p><strong>For SMRT Bus Captains: Greater career progression and a rewarding career with better pay and benefits</strong></p>
              <p>1.         In July this year, two SMRT Bus Captains were promoted to “Master Bus Captain”, the pinnacle position that all Bus Captains can aspire to attain in the bus industry today.</p>
              <p>2.         Building on the SMRT Bus Career Scheme that was launched in 2013, SMRT aims to develop and nurture every Bus Captain by providing them with career progression supported by a competency-based training model. This model maps out a clear route of career advancement with more senior Bus Captains taking on supervising, mentoring and training roles.</p>
              <p>3.         SMRT will focus on building a Career Beyond Driving for staff of SMRT Buses. Employees will continue to undergo training and personal development so as to enjoy wider deployment options to other departments, depending on their aspirations and competencies. This includes training, mentoring, supervision of crew, and roles in the Bus operations control centres.</p>
              <p>4.         We have also recently concluded negotiations with the National Transport Workers’ Union (NTWU) and almost 3,300 Bus Captains, Operational and Service support staff will benefit from a host of enhanced employment terms including salary, welfare and benefits. These recognise and reward employees for better service delivery, and to ensure better welfare for them as they go about their work.
              Riding on the Success of our Bus Career Scheme.</p>
              <p>5.         Mr Tay Chiang Hin, one of the two Bus Captains who were recently promoted to the position of Master Bus Captain, said: “As a Master Bus Captain, my duties involve mentoring, in addition to driving. On an average working day, I spend half the day driving and the other half mentoring and training other Bus Captains. Under the new Bus Contracting Model (BCM), a lot of emphasis is placed on teamwork. Everyone must work together so we can meet the requirements set out by the BCM and retain existing services, as well as win new packages. There are also more incentives to encourage Bus Captains to meet the required service standards. This helps with the career prospects of Bus Captains, and it is definitely more attractive because of the remuneration and incentives available.”</p>
              <p>6.         SMRT’s Vice President of Human Resources, Mr Gerard Koh said: “SMRT offers a comprehensive career package to our Bus crew, beyond a good salary. Firstly, we offer a rewarding career with progression and wider deployment opportunities. We also offer benefits that look after the welfare of our staff – in healthcare and medical needs, and work-life balance. As for salaries, it goes beyond a competitive basic pay. The incentives and rewards we offer emphasise teamwork, safety and service. Collectively our Bus crew are rewarded as they deliver reliable and high quality services to our commuters.”
              Focusing on Commuter-Centric Operations by encouraging teamwork.</p>
              <p>7.         A new Team Based Incentive (TBI) will be rolled out to drive teamwork and reward teams for working together and delivering service excellence to our commuters. All employees who are supporting bus operations will be eligible for the TBI and can receive up to $300 more a month. Through the TBI, SMRT Buses will share the Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) incentives awarded by LTA to bus operators with our staff when they achieve service standards set by the authorities.
              Welfare and Care for Employees.</p>
              <p>8.         The healthcare and welfare of our staff are important to us, especially as the workforce ages.</p>
              <p>9.         E-FLEX and Rider to Complement MediShield Life. SMRT will implement an Enhanced Flexible Benefit scheme (E-FLEX) to better care for the medical needs of our Bus Captains. E-FLEX complements MediShield Life, and all Singaporean and Permanent Resident (PR) Bus Captains will be emplaced onto E-FLEX. They will receive E-FLEX credits of between $350 to $1,050, depending on their years in service. They can use their E-FLEX credits to buy portable medical insurance through the Integrated Shield Plans (ISPs) and enjoy better medical coverage and ward eligibility if hospitalised. Together with MediShield Life and an Insurance Rider bought by SMRT, incumbent Singaporean and PR staff will enjoy full hospitalisation coverage with no deductibles or co-payment for B2 wards at restructured hospitals.</p>
              <p>10.      For employees on work permits, they will see an increase of their E-FLEX credits by $50, from $150 to $200. SMRT will continue to purchase insurance to cover their hospitalisation costs.</p>
              <p>11.      SMRT is also setting up Medical Clinics in Woodlands Depot and Bishan Depot from October 2016, to provide employees with reliable healthcare at their workplace for greater convenience. These clinics will educate our workforce on healthy lifestyle practices, better treat staff with chronic illnesses (e.g. high cholesterol, hypertension, etc.) and provide on-site medical screening.</p>
              <p>12.      More Annual Leave. In order to provide employees with greater work-life balance, all SMRT Buses employees can look forward to up to 21 days of Annual Leave (up to seven days more than present) depending on their years in service. Besides the Annual Leave, SMRT also provides two days of Elder Care Leave for staff to spend quality time with their aged family members.
              Restructured Pay and Remuneration.</p>
              <p>13.      Increase of Basic Pay to $1,950. From 1 September 2016, SMRT’s Bus Captains will have an increase of at least $300 to their basic pay, in recognition of their service to the company. At the same time, the starting salary for local (Singaporean and PR) Bus Captains will be raised to $1,950, an increase of almost 20% from the present $1,625.</p>
              <p>14.      The revised salary package, will see new Bus Captains earn a monthly gross salary of up to $3,540. 
              Enhanced Re-Employment Age.</p>
              <p>15.      Moving ahead, SMRT will engage and provide our employees with long-term job security, if they wish to carry on working. We will be extending our re-employment contract age up to 69 years old, as long as our staff are fit and able to fulfil the job requirements, are productive, and continue to achieve good performance at work. This move will allow experienced and able Bus Captains, operational and support staff to continue contributing meaningfully to the growing public bus industry in Singapore.
              Free Travel on Public Transport.</p>
              <p>16.       In recognition of their contributions to the public transport industry in Singapore, all SMRT staff will be given free travel on all public bus and train networks, throughout the year.</p>
              <p>17.      These changes in benefits will be made from 1 September 2016 through to 1 January 2017.</p>
