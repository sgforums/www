              <p>Nice tries! I can see that you have improved a lot since the 1st photos you have posted up here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>May i know, if you felt excited when you saw 8033 and the DM3500, so your pics went blur? Me having the same problem too =P</p>

              <p>Well... After reading the posts by some of you guys here, it sets my thinking and somehow it just makes me feel very hurtful here..</p>
              <p>Not trying to be emotional here, but my point of view is that not everyone here learn things in a very fast pace, and although for many times, they posted photos which are not up to standard to most of us here (that includes myself as well as some of you here may have known that my standard is also quite high too), we should forgive them and not going all out just to condemn them..</p>
              <p>I just find that some of you here may have lack in certain areas, such as being <strong>humble</strong> and having <strong>patience</strong> towards others, especially to slow learners over here. Our <strong>willingness to teach</strong> and <strong>mentor</strong> others also do play a part too.. I just find that some of the weaker ones here really have the burning passion to master good photography of taking bus photos, but what they lack is the "<strong>1-to-1 mentoring</strong>" system.. Previously, I have done that to the users of TIB589B and SBS1984E/SBS1985C too, and now I see their bus photography skills have improved a lot as compared to the beginning part before I mentored them.. Sometimes the weaker ones just couldn't learn much by just viewing other people's photos alone, hence we have to understand and forgive them for what they have..</p>
              <p>Trust me, when there are more stronger ones who have the willingness and patience to mentor the weaker ones (of course not by keeping condemning or scolding that person but to encourage that person), you will be able to see a difference in this forum, not just for photography alone, but to other aspects as well such as technical and deployment stuffs.</p>
              <p>Whatever things here I have just mentioned above, go back and think through it.. All of us here are humans after all, and we shouldn't deserve this kind of treatment. This is NOT a military place, we don't deserved to be condemned by others just because we are weak in a particular area, but more often, what we need is encouragements from one another..</p>
