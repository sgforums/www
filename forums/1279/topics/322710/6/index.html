              <p><br>Sorry for being blunt down here. <br><br>Good photos are sort of a satisfaction to a photographer. If your photos aren't any up to standard, i suggest not to post since people will not be able to identify the exact bus.</p>
              <p>And one more point down here. It looks sort of humiliating to see these photos up there. If one were to teach other on photographer skills, i see no reason why the "TEACHER" take photos worse than students. So how do people able to learn from such a "TEACHER" down here.</p>
              <p>Spotting location doesn't seems perfect for taking photos at all. Either sunlight direction wrong or photo gets pixelated. So what's the point of using a digital camera? Waste of money? Why not use handphone camera instead? And my handphone camera seems to be better than this digital camera.</p>

              <p>You can easily identify nice and ugly photos down here. If you were to travel from the West to the East to take photos and without standard, wouldn't it be a waste of time for the day? If the photo turns out very nice, it would definetly be of great satisfaction and thinking the effort for the day is worth for travelling.</p>

              <p>I never questioned the joy of photo taking. I just didn't understand why you posted that. Now, let's not lose sight that this thread is about posting photos of buses. Not wanting to hijack this thread, I shall stop here. Happy photo taking everyone.</p>

              <p>I believe this is a place where people are able to voice their views, contribute what they know and ask questions without the worries of humiliation. although i have to admit i have gone overboard at times. i feel that there has been a sudden influx of new members in this forum and that ive heard from most of them, they have no idea what they have done to cause them to get flamed. although it takes a bit of patience. i believe that theres always a nice way to tell people something. if they just do not want to cooperate after reminders, just let them be and rot. this place should be a place of building people up and also a place to educate each member from the oldest to the youngest. no one likes to be humiliated esp when they have no idea why they have been reprimanded by. although some of us may be annoying, like me, and take longer time to learn, hopefully not like me, i do hope that there would be some exercising of patience and tolerance and that we should strive to learn to accept everyone just as they are. arguments should be done in private messages and that the main purpose is to learn and that we hope that this group will learn to unify even thoguh they may not agree with each other all the time. i commend tamago for his constant locking and updating of threads so as to improve the status in the forum. i do believe that it is not nice to see a forum with people ranting away and that theres no peace that resides in this forum. many people have seen this forum as one of the lowest although it is the most active one. if you have that mindset, you should learn to change it, as this is a public forum and many people view this forum and that would clearly judge what kind of community we have. like e.g in the army the seniority bullying the recruits etc.</p>
              <p>you may not like the person or the person is still new but that does not mean you purposely shoot him down at useless or unsupported posts like 101 getting K230UB in 2 weeks time (not to pinpoint anyone). however, i must stress that certain rules are still meant to be followed. like not contributing photos that do not belong to you without permission and furthermore, claiming it to be your own. Also try to reduce personal attacks, or result in getting shot.</p>
