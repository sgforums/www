              <p><br>Everyone started off as beginners. Not only in photography, but also in buses as a whole. I'm sure you have taken bad shots before. It's also the same for everyone else. Things can't be learnt overnight. However, you expect everyone to post good pictures here. Judging from your comments, I think you prefer no shot over bad shot.</p>
              <p>For example, you are a tourist who has come to visit Singapore. You are at the Merlion and it is cloudy. I'd say you would not bother to take a shot because "the lighting is no good".</p>
              <p>All you do is criticise other people's pictures. Yet I have never seen you help another person to improve in his shots. Someone has definitely taught you phototaking skills. Why don't you impart your skills to someone else?</p>

              <p>Pointers are everywhere in this thread. We teach and the result is the same. So what's the point now? You all simply dont learn and now you start to blame me for being blunt to them. What i would like to see is improvement results and not always the same standard. If 2 years of photography without improvement, what's the point of people guilding? Pointless.</p>

              <p>Like what 9888Y mentioned, you can teach them whenever possible, but if they just ignore your sound advices, you should just ignore them.</p>
              <p>If you are a teacher teaching the academically weaker students, do you just give up and feel its pointless teaching them, just because they dont show an improvement in results?</p>
