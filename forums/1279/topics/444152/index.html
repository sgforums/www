              <p>It's actually better this way than to wait for people to squeeze in , and still cannot fit in attempt to squeeze and waste time.</p>
              <p>I love the way the NEL works, 18-20 secs and regardless of whether you board the train or exit the train, the door closes and never opens back. This is both on peak and non peak periods</p>
              <p>It makes you move faster ! then to relax and stroll in and out of the train .. </p>
              <p>SMRT pamper commutters for too long already, leave train doors open for a minute , etc at stations like JE , etc .. delay and waste time. People just dont give up when they know they cant squeeze in. </p>

              <p><br>NEL's case is all because of what if... There's PIW happened to be boarding/ alighting? I guess that's why CCL's dwell time got adjusted later on.</p>
              <p>SMRT's problem I believe is too much of the connecting train must be readily available at platform nonsense. Sometimes they could rush commuters at stations like Chinese Garden only to wait for 70 sec at Jurong East for the NSL train to arrive.</p>
              <p>SMRT is not pampering ppl, it's creating a hazardous ops env... Reminds me of days back at Expo.. Took the train, when it arr TNM, ppl rushing to the WB platform when the buzzer and flashing light was alrdy up.. TO dare not close door.. Rear train was 1 min behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Some commuters complain dun have to be scared of.. Like tis gotta accommodate for each n every complain to no end..</p>

              <p>And then, here goes the whole thing:</p>
              <p>Door opens - 5 ppl come out (1 sec) - first person go in (half a sec) - DING DONG DOORS ARE CLOSING - Door closes (dwell time estimated 3.5 sec) - train leaves 1/9 of a sec after door closes.</p>
