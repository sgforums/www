Like that the whole interchange would be noisy and crowded and would have no peace. While Tampines is too congested a lot of people walking there with all those salesman or like what stated ahdibuao by marketing people which survey for a long time. The place is also filled with fumes and cigaratte smell which I could not take and stand it</div>

Like that the whole interchange would be noisy and crowded and would have no peace. While Tampines is too congested a lot of people walking there with all those salesman or like what stated ahdibuao by marketing people which survey for a long time. The place is also filled with fumes and cigaratte smell which I could not take and stand it</div></blockquote></div>

We should be proud on our army boys as they serve NS to protect the country and next time I am also experiencing too. I am supportive of our army boys and for the comment being made I admitted that I never think properly and just type and post. Next time when I post in the topic I should think the post that I post whether I got say any not so good remarks on one group of the community. Once again I am sorry for the remarks being made and deeply regretted too</div>
