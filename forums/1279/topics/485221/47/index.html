              <p>sv 860 got another 2 fleet add... can you imagine in last 3 months got 6 buses added??? When it started out +2 years back, fleet size was 06 buses, today: 16 buses.</p>
              <p>Maybe time for 860 to get bendies rather than just go on fleet add like no one's business. Given further HDBs mushrooming along st 51 and ring road... how many buses will the route add? Maybe in due course 860 will have a bus every 01-02 mins if high capacity (HC) buses are not added to the fleet.</p>

              <p>wrong...there is still shortage of manpower.. the bus companies themselves are not really adding any more buses/slots apparently due to shortage of drivers. all the new drivers are for BSEP program instead and to replace those who resign/retire etc...(there is no net increase in the no of buses (exclude BSEP buses) for SBST/SMRT in the past 3 years).</p>
              <p>further, more than 600 BSEP buses have been added over 3 years,  which in average 200 buses per year, which mean around 15- 20  new driver each month which is quite normal.. there is still shortage of bus drivers that why new services are still rolling out slowly... </p>

              <p>I think LTA/SMRT, should work out for the convenience of passengers a way to bring in bendies on 860. If DDs cannot be put yet, please put bendies. The loading is atrocious and is going to ever-increase, until a parallel service on ring road to MRT is launched. </p>
              <p>In AM peak, there is a bus every 03 mins to Khatib MRT, and every 05 mins to Yishun MRT. Please note, that many HDBs still don't have high occupancy along ring road and have just opened. Once more people come in, 860 is going to get unmanageable with rigids.</p>
              <p>If 983 can get DDs for a shorter route, 860 definitely can!! </p>
              <p>My proposal is: 15 buses (10 DDs, 5 SDs).. </p>
              <p>10 DDs do sv 860, 5 SDs do 860A &amp; downroutes in PM.</p>
              <p>Reason why DDs should do 860 because there are many HDBs opened up along the northern part of ring road that is closer to Yishun. The other alternative service here is 804 but that is more winding and already comes quite full from st 41/ave 1/ave 11. Hence, 860 does have quite some steam to Yishun MRT on the last few stops as well + there will be others who want to go to shop/transfer at bus interchange that will board earlier on ring road and can go upper deck.</p>

              <p>Yeah you are right. But can only depend on bendy crossover during morning peak hours and it is only 1 bendy which is not enough. But what to do, BSEP does not suppory bendies. Must bear with the loadings in the moment until DDs introduced on 860 in the next coming months</p>

              <p>Yeah you are right. But can only depend on bendy crossover
              during morning peak hours and it is only 1 bendy which is not
              enough. But what to do, BSEP does not suppory bendies. Must bear
              with the loadings in the moment until DDs introduced on 860 in the
              next coming months</p>

              <p>I think LTA/SMRT, should work out for the convenience of
              passengers a way to bring in bendies on 860. If DDs cannot be put
              yet, please put bendies. The loading is atrocious and is going to
              ever-increase, until a parallel service on ring road to MRT is
              launched. </p>
              <p>In AM peak, there is a bus every 03 mins to Khatib MRT, and
              every 05 mins to Yishun MRT. Please note, that many HDBs still
              don't have high occupancy along ring road and have just opened.
              Once more people come in, 860 is going to get unmanageable with
              rigids.</p>
              <p>If 983 can get DDs for a shorter route, 860 definitely
              can!! </p>
              <p>My proposal is: 15 buses (10 DDs, 5 SDs).. </p>
              <p>10 DDs do sv 860, 5 SDs do 860A &amp; downroutes in PM.</p>
              <p>Reason why DDs should do 860 because there are many HDBs opened
              up along the northern part of ring road that is closer to Yishun.
              The other alternative service here is 804 but that is more winding
              and already comes quite full from st 41/ave 1/ave 11. Hence, 860
              does have quite some steam to Yishun MRT on the last few stops as
              well + there will be others who want to go to shop/transfer at bus
              interchange that will board earlier on ring road and can go upper
              deck.</p>

              <p>There is a pair of bus stop up along Yishun Ring Road (if you all noticed)... Get ready for a heavier load for Svc 860 when the flats are up...</p>
              <p>Loading for 860 already so congested... 860A also cannot cope... My bus stop got 811 and 811P but always takes a long time (I wondering what the driver doing at Ave 1 bus stop..)</p>

              <p>Hmmm.. I not sure about extending it to Sembawang... Sembawang service like 859 and 882 + 981 and 962 should be amended in such a way that it covers various sector of the estate...</p>
              <p>860 already is an alternative for passengers to head to Khatib MRT instead of Yishun MRT easing the load of 806 &amp; 804... Just my one cent... I dunno about the rest. But surely can work something out also...</p>
