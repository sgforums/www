              <p>There is no profit to be made in operating buses, unless its under GCM. The financial records of both SBS and SMRT support this, bus business under the old model is simply not profitable.</p>

              <p>I don't understand what is the issue with standing. People have
              been standing on buses in Singapore for a very long time, and then
              suddenly bus companies have to provide for pampered, lazy, self
              entitled people?</p>
              <p>If people in the past can board and stand right at the front
              next to the radiator on an Olympian, or right next to the engine on
              a front engined bus, both of which are non-airconditioned, why
              can't people nowadays stand in the aisle of a low floor bus? Its
              not like there has been a massive and simultaneous genetic mutation
              that renders humans incapable of standing.</p>
              <p>So suddenly, people are complaining that a certain bus company
              is buying too many SDs, when the real issue is people refusing to
              stand. And who is going to pay for any upsizing of buses? Nobody,
              because people complain about fare hikes. Don't expect LTA to stop
              buying SDs, because under the GCM, they will be the one bearing the
              costs, and I would expect them to cut down on unnecessary usage or
              overcapacity using whatever data they may obtain.</p>

              <p>the problem is not about standing.</p>
              <p>i still see pax standing all the way to the entrance doors but empty towards the rear. maybe the aisle is way too narrow, so it makes a issue whenever pax alights at bus stop. the A22s modified seat arrangement is a joke, remove 3 seats, but can at most fit in 2 standees; the rear seat had a grabpole right in the middle. the previous modification on the Tibs O405 is much better.</p>
              <p>the number of rigids is too much, bear in mind 6.9m population white paper which is a estimate population in 2030. 800+ rigids against just over 200 DDs and a mere 41 bendies.</p>

              <p>from what i see, the queue is long when the next bus is delayed due to the jam along TPE. on 969 in the evening weekday, a bendy is scheduled after a DD or even a DD after another. it is sometimes when you see a rigid appearing.</p>

              <p>Reading some of the above convo, this is what I feel.</p>
              <p>There is delay due to traffic conditions and this is understandable, but because of that 2 DDs leaving back to back from interchange does not make sense.</p>
              <p>First one goes housefull, second one goes empty... and then there is a big lag again... rather I feel it is okay to delay by few minutes at interchange so that bus gets good load.. otherwise again you have same problem.</p>
              <p>The bus can cover on its way the few minutes lag, otherwise it will always tail the housefull DD in front, and go back empty. </p>

              <p>In Perth and Sydney, the "conductor" is usually a route supervisor and almost always a qualified driver himself. That is part of "rising from the ranks".</p>
              <p>Complaints against the "conductor" is practically useless, because the same person also handles customer feedback at the depot.</p>
              <p>The other type of "conductor" you may hear of in Australia are transit guards. They are usually armed and have powers to arrest.</p>

              <p>Yes the queue will get longer. No choice. At least, nobody sent to STOMP regards to the situation they have created. </p>
              <p>BUT, every 969 buses that departs TMI, will have pax standing also, regardless of the type of buses. Not empty, not full, but average. </p>
              <p>Those who wishes to get a seat, would usually join the queue. But those who wishes to board ASAP, would mostly queue outside. </p>
              <p>Actually, come to think of it again, 969 do not need to have full fleet DD. Just deploy more buses on 969A, run it frequently..perhaps it could solve the issue alr. Most pax. will alight along Yishun.</p>
              <p>Unlike 161/168, these 2 are "accumulating" pax along the way before reaching Wdl. </p>

              <p>Yes the queue will get longer. No choice. At least, nobody sent
              to STOMP regards to the situation they have created. </p>
              <p>BUT, every 969 buses that departs TMI, will have pax standing
              also, regardless of the type of buses. Not empty, not full, but
              average. </p>
              <p>Those who wishes to get a seat, would usually join the queue.
              But those who wishes to board ASAP, would mostly queue
              outside. </p>
              <p>Actually, come to think of it again, 969 do not need to have
              full fleet DD. Just deploy more buses on 969A, run it
              frequently..perhaps it could solve the issue alr. Most pax. will
              alight along Yishun.</p>
              <p>Unlike 161/168, these 2 are "accumulating" pax along the way
              before reaching Wdl. </p>

              <p>bro, can you do a similar analysis for 291/293? I know you keep saying that these services have too many extra buses. Will be nice to see real data like you have shown for 969. </p>
