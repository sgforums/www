              <p>Hi mr SBS2652G, I took Sbs 117 yesterday morning. It was 19 min
              for the trip from seletar aerospace drive (before west camp rd) to
              the bus stop nearest yishun mrt and 19.5 min on the return trip. So
              I will say it is about equal with Sbs 103. Anyway hope this is just
              the starting and with months to go, once loading increases, I
              believe the bus captains will drive much faster to compensate back.
              I welcome your thoughts here! <span style="line-height: 1.231;">For me, distance wise, Sbs 85 will be a
              better choice than 117. Cheers. Thanks.</span></p>

              <p>sv 7 is notorious for bunching. There hasn't been a downgrade. There are 5 SDs in fleet. In fact in last 2 years, sv 7 has got upgrades as earlier it had 8 SDs. Slowly converted to DD slots.</p>
              <p>If you find a bus has come after long waiting, maybe check app, there will be a bus right behind because sv 7 has a peak frequency of 08 mins. </p>

              <p>sv 7 is notorious for bunching. There hasn't been a downgrade.
              There are 5 SDs in fleet. In fact in last 2 years, sv 7 has got
              upgrades as earlier it had 8 SDs. Slowly converted to DD slots.</p>
              <p>If you find a bus has come after long waiting, maybe check app,
              there will be a bus right behind because sv 7 has a peak frequency
              of 08 mins. </p>

              <p>Thanks for assuring that there is no capacity downgrade on 7.  Maybe the festive season has up the passenger loads too. </p>

              <p>Yes actually most Orchard bound services are going to see higher loading than usual because of festive season. Last weekend also sv 7 / 14 were packed to door. </p>

              <p><strong>This is SBST v/s SMRT</strong></p>
              <p>SBST will deploy DDs even on services that do not need them and SMRT will play cheap and deploy their sucky MANA22s even when DDs are needed.</p>
              <p>On day 1 of operation, SBST launched DDs on services that could have done without DDs such as :</p>
              <p>41 &gt; you can argue DDs are doing okay, but that's just bcoz it duplicates 183 route. The Beauty World section is just SD seating loading. Now with Beauty World MRT opening, loading could improve. But DDs were given year in advance.</p>
              <p>201 &gt; The DDs are doing well in the old 189 route, but the Clementi - Pandan is purely SD seating loading, yet when 201 got fleet add to improve frequency, it was DD instead of SD.</p>
              <p>119 &gt; The classic example of 3 years of wasted DD resources. 119 was expected to get heavy loading because of boom in flats in Punggol West and being the only service, but guess what, it never got more than 40 (99% times) bet Punggol/Sengkang. Still SBST continues to have those DDs.</p>
              <p>102 &gt; Another example of DDs wasted. The route b/w Hougang and Sengkang fetches at max 20-30 pax, could get to 50 pax for Sengkang-Sengkang west. Manageable by Citaros, but 50% fleet DD from day 1.</p>
              <p>47 &gt; Need to still evaluate if service needs DDs, could need for TNM-CBP, but again SBST decided to give DDs from day 1 instead of monitoring loading</p>
              <p>117 &gt; This route in future needs to be full fleet DD, but this would be only in 2017 given the huge number of flats in Punggol West, Yishun Ave 1, Canberra. But DDs get kicked in a year before. </p>
              <p><strong>Now, lets look at SMRT</strong></p>
              <p>860 &gt; Such a high loading route. No HC buses and 16 buses have to be operated for such a short route, due to non-deployment of HC buses. Now have 1 MANdy.</p>
              <p>979 &gt; It was clear that DDs are required, but SMRT decided to play cheap and operate only MANA22s</p>
              <p>983 &gt; If this was SBST route, it would be full fleet DD. But no, once again play cheap by deploying A22s that cannot tank the ave 5 loading</p>
              <p>301 &gt; will need bendies from now on, but guess what SMRT will give it none, and just go on adding A22s.</p>
              <p>No wonder 117 was given to SBST bcoz guess what if SMRT had it, it would be full fleet A22. </p>
