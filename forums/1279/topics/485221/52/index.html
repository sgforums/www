              <p>Meanwhile, it is confirmed that there would be no bus int in the

              <ul>
              <li>((1)) <strong>Install a U-turn / loop-around somewhere along Airport Blvd</strong>, after the first pair of bus stops and before the height limit. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>That'd make it DD-friendly (so some heavy-loading services can utilize the "M" variant" more). The remaining services can finish the ferry service to the terminal. Any additional needs can be fulfilled by adding airport shuttle services.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>((2)) If all else fails ... consider <strong>adding a pair of bus stops along PIE</strong> just before Changi South Ave 3, then spam 24A from Upp Changi Rd East to Airport PTB during airport peak hours. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>"M" variant services (with DDs) would just loop back via ECP and Xilin Ave, serving both stops in turn (Though this would require the left turn from ECP to Changi Coast Rd be modified into a proper junction). <br></li>

              <p>err, you need to consider the proportions of the 3axle trailer VS a Bendy bus though. <br><br>If you're talking about the normal lorry cab + trailer, the lorry cab (the one with the engine) is way shorter than the Bendy bus cab (the front of the bus before the articulated portion)..the shorter length of the lorry cab would definitely give it more flexibility and manoeuvrability compared to the Bendy bus cab though..</p>

              <p>Although 24 does duplicate MRT, it has heavy loading between Changi Airport and Tanah Merah, and even Bedok. I used to take 24 frequently at this sector, and no matter it's 6pm or 10pm, the buses are always packed. There may be more workers at Airport and Upp Changi Rd East taking 24 to Tanah Merah than you thought (although alternative services such as 2 and 12 are there). </p>

              <p>I no where said 24 does not have good loading. Among all the other services calling at airport, 24 is the only one that parallels MRT. Also note for those at terminal 1 and 3 better to take 24 as MRT is available only on terminal 2. This proposal is if we want to accommodate DDs. At the same time we cannot omit a terminal without having any service calling there. Each terminal needs at least one service for people to transfer at airport boulevard or need to operate shuttle buses between all terminals and bus terminal. There is no best solution here</p>

              <p>Yes 14 also is too long.. but 14 does serve unique purpose to connect Bedok North Road with Tanah Merah MRT and UEC. But I think even 14 deserves to be split into two services. </p>

              <p>I like your suggestion on 61. That's exactly what I would have suggested. Just that I would number the two services 61 from Eunos and 71 from Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>For 67, I think it should be CCK / Lor 1 Geylang and 68 from Tampines loop @ Middle Road</p>
              <p>For 51, I think it should be Jurong East Interchange loop @ Tiong Bahru and introduce 150 from Hougang Interchange to Buona Vista Terminal.</p>
              <p>Yes we will need more buses, but I think the quality of service provided will be better.</p>
