              <p>sv 70 has very high uni-directional loading.. opp direction loading is quite low especially during AM between Shenton Way and NEX and same during PM... hence the high # of SDs. Can get 1-2 SD slots converted to DD though. sv 51 can get 2 SD slots converted to DD.</p>

              <p>961 with 32 buses is reasonable cos during peak the waiting time will stretch to 10-15 mins if 2 buses bunch up, the next bus will be near full after long wait...Â </p>

              <p>20 should get 2 more SDs to dd.. Fleet of 10 buses with 4 DDs and 6 SDs will be apt with more spacing between dd and less bet Sd arrival. 174 I really don't know why so many SDs. Need more DDs. 7 is okay with current fleet. Pax travel long distance Hd upper deck well used. Plus it is unique route, hence with sd if pax can't board.. There is issue. Hence in last few months, 7 got SDs converted to dd and should stay this way. Also weekend heavy load for Sv 7 for bugis, orchard, Dempsey, holland village.Â </p>

              <p>It was bound to happen. Earlier BPJ ring road residents would take LRT/920/922 and transfer to 700 to get to Orchard. With 972 directly at door step or walking distance, no need to waste time going to BPJ Temp Park/Pending LRT for 700.</p>
              <p>So now 700 loading is limited to Pending and Petir road residents. On the other hand, 972 every bus is full in AM towards Orchard. Need more high capacity buses deployed soon before someone posts video at stop before PIE in AM for 972.</p>
              <p>190 loading not affected with introduction of 972. Still very high. 700 is the one that is affected but still getting 60-70 pax on every bus in AM. Coz we also have to take into account huge number of HDBs being build around Segar/Senja and condos around Petir.</p>

              <p>971 can do a full day service that follow original routes and extend to Harbourfront with</p>

              <p>It was bound to happen. Earlier BPJ ring road residents would
                  take LRT/920/922 and transfer to 700 to get to Orchard. With 972
                  directly at door step or walking distance, no need to waste time
                  going to BPJ Temp Park/Pending LRT for 700.</p>
              <p>So now 700 loading is limited to Pending and Petir road
                  residents. On the other hand, 972 every bus is full in AM towards
                  Orchard. Need more high capacity buses deployed soon before someone
                  posts video at stop before PIE in AM for 972.</p>
              <p>190 loading not affected with introduction of 972. Still very
                  high. 700 is the one that is affected but still getting 60-70 pax
                  on every bus in AM. Coz we also have to take into account huge
                  number of HDBs being build around Segar/Senja and condos around
                  Petir.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, one of the main reasons why after so many enhancements plus introduction of smrt 972, smrt 190 loading is still consistently high is because it originates from choa Chu Kang bus interchange. There is a steady stream of people who uses smrt 190 from CCK. It remains as the sole route from CCK to orchard at the fastest possible speed, even faster than MRT. All other services are from bukit panjang. That is why many people persistently cry foul over the focus on bukit panjang and neglect CCK. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Rapidbus 700 used to ply along parts of the Marsiling estate if I am not wrong. It also plied along old Woodlands Road (relatively similar to 960 but skips all the bus stops along that sector) before going into Bt Panjang Estate and BKE.</p>

              <p>Yah, because it's slightly long-winded like SBST style, and due to low ridership as last time the areas along the route weren't that as developed as what we current have...</p>

              <p>Agreed. But AM should be okay because bus comes full from CCK. and BPJ residents will take 972/700 instead. PM is the main issue coz if ppl see 190 coming first, they will take it even if they are BPJ resident. That's where CCK residents are at disadvantage.Â </p>
              <p>The only option here is now with 972 and 700, people should condition to take these buses to BPJ and change over to 190. I know it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>Â ideal but better than going standing/cramped all the way to CCK.Â </p>

              <p>I wouldnt support that decision because it will be quite winding for Woodlands residents who would not take it to Orchard. Also 966 will follow same route until PIE. So lot of duplication.</p>
              <p>I support sv 700 to be extended to CCK via Yew Tee. Go via CCK Dr do Yew Tee Crescent, come back via CCK Way to CCK Interchange. This way you will connect the other side of 190 in CCK, Yew Tee and also provide relief to over-crowded 190. This would be a good change to make. The extension can be under BSEP with 6 additional buses, and LTA can deploy all E500s to beef up capacity.</p>

              <p>Yes I agree with that point.. should just have 951E edited to ply full day then instead of winding 700. I really want 700 to extend to CCK and serve YT residents instead.Â </p>
