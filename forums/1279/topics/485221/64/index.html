              <p>103 not a surprise.. was overdue.. especially with the huge development at SAP... 103 buses in PM towards Jalan Kayu are packed.. and it has bi-directional load... </p>
              <p>Good fleet for 103 would be 10 SDs, 5 DDs.. SDs operating at a frequency of 10 mins, while DDs at 13 mins.</p>

It does not matter whether you are promoted to year two next year or tio retained in year one or next year going poly. Poly also must study damn hard. In fact, I think you better stay on in JC, cuz I heard that NTU/NUS are going to take in more JC students and less Poly students. It's going to be more easy for JC students and more difficult for poly students to get into the local universities.</p>

              <p>Hey. Thanks for this message. The reason why I came back to this forum was because I had finished my o levels and wanted to explore this community. Well with this, I will rather spend more time learning about aeronautics. I had to use a graphic calculator in sec3. I am not studying for A Levels. Hope this helps.</p>
