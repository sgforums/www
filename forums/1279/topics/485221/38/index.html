              <p>Can assure you that out of the 4 perm DDs on Sv 39, I can safely say there's at least 2 of them on full-day shifts. ie, off-peak there's still Wrights on Sv 39.</p>
              <p><strong>3920B</strong> is the 5th last bus from Yishun. 2308hrs PSR Town Park bus stop towards Tampines.<br><span style="line-height: 21.8844432830811px;">And if I didn't remember wrongly, I think <strong>3913Y 3916P</strong> are both on A/P shifts for 03 Jun as well because I saw them at like mid-day. </span></p>
              <p>Idk who spotted <strong>3919G</strong> at what time, or if 3920B replaced 3919G, but i definitely didn't see 3919G on 03 Jun (Wed). So it would be good if someone could verify if either 3920B or 3919G are still on Sv 39 or not in the coming days, thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, don't think that is the act of politician. It is rather the acts of requests of many residents staying at sengkang west way. Pity those who stayed there. They only have a bus service Sbs 85 at their doorstep. Moreover the frequency of this service is very poor. 15 min 1 bus usually. Seriously sengkang west way needs more than sbs 85. LTA has been rather slow in giving them another new service, thus gives in to the residents request of a double decker sbs 85. I believe not many people in this forum go to sengkang west way. Try going there some day and see the number of flats undergoing construction and many flats are already ready. </p>
              <p>Take note sbs 50, sbs 163 ply sengkang west ave. sbs 86, sbs 103 ply on exterior road of sengkang west (jalan Kayu). Only sbs 85 plies sengkang west way. Some other services goes by exterior (yio Chu Kang road). This sengkang west way area badly needs a few more bus services. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Yes but for Sengkang West Way residents LRT is not nearby. It is like asking punggol Central residents to walk to Punggol Dr or Punggol Field to take LRT.</p>
              <p>And even though LRT is at door-step, you still have 163/50 as options to take you to Sengkang MRT from Sengkang West/East Ave, so it is only fair that West/East way also get direct bus service to MRT.</p>
              <p>It is surprising given that LTA did not think twice before launching a redundant short feeder like 324 that could have been managed with a 62B or something. And for Sengkang west Way which is very far, taking so long to introduce service.</p>

              <p>Hi mr wsy1234, I don't agree. Why? As usual, those around sengkang MRT area (under PAP) have most facilities and amenities. Sengkang east is under WP currently. Way before then, it is under PAP and the concept of new towns is to have few catchment areas for people to congregate and mingle and do basic stuff. So they plan for rivervale mall and rivervale plaza as 2 important malls for people in Sengkang east to come. As it is new town, they think young people prefer malls to normal coffee shops and hawker centres such as those found in nature estates. </p>
              <p>When they realize that young people also want basic amenities just nearby their houses, they change the concepts and implement in Sengkang west (under PAP currently). Every conceivable place where possible in Sengkang west, they try to have commercial areas, be it coffee shop or small minimart. For new btos, they are trying to have these shops as part of the btos. Previously, they do not do that in Sengkang east. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Yeaps, that helps though. I think 3920B is now back to BNDEP. I spotted it on Sv 2 a few days ago, so I think it's not in CGBP anymore. Same with 8348X which was kicked out of Sv 39. So I think 3919G is the one being perm 39 instead, not 3920B. </p>

              <p>Err, like what 'carbikebus' said, during Off-Peak, at most it's only 3/4 full.</p>
              <p>But i've taken the Wrights on Sv 39 quite a few times during AM Peak already so far, and the seats are usually all taken up (both upper &amp; lower decks), with also a few standees for now. But might have something to do with the H1 schedule &amp; June sch hols. </p>
              <p>We'll probably see more pax onboard the DDs after the Sch hols ends. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Another point to add on is that, I observed too that on average the Wright indeed spends less time at each stop compared to the KUBs/Citaros to load the same amount of pax. Abit like "duh~" I know. But it does help the Sv 39 BCs to keep to their frequency better.<br><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I've not seen any bunching during AM Peak yet so far, which is a good sign, especially when it's kinda common to see 2x KUBs bunching tgt last time. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I do wish they do something to their Off-Peak frequency though. Not sure if it's related to the H1 schedule, but during Off Peak (especially mid-day &amp; early afternoon), it's kinda normal to wait for 20-25mins nowadays for a Sv 39, even though the E-timetable says otherwise..</span></p>
