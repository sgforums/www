              <p>What? A world class airport should have a bus interchange on the
              road, and NOT in the basement. For God sake, anyone who comes to
              Changi airport and wants to take bus, will have a horrible
              impression of taking bus from a basement. </p>
              <p>I think the concern that LTA has is not about building an
              interchange on the road level. Can do it easily. They are not sure
              how to connect all 3 terminals and in future 4 terminals. Any
              consolidation in one terminal is going to cause some inconvenience
              to commuters, while benefit to a majority. But that inconvenience
              to a few is what LTA is afraid of.</p>

              <p>Given T5's close proximity to T4, I feel it would be good to have one separate int serving T4 and 5. In other words, one terminal for T1-3, and another for T4/5. This not only provides convenience for all pax, but also justifies a second int as T5 will be as big as T1-3 COMBINED. So there will not be worries about a dedicated terminal for T4 to be underutilised.</p>
              <p>Once again I deeply regret the lack of foresight and ground work on CAAS's part, for not including a centralised bus int in the Jewel, DESPITE the problem of crowding and delays already being so rampant during the planning of the Jewel. It was the perfect location for a centralised bus station for T1-3. At least, I hope for the bus terminal to be near the Jewel in the future.</p>
              <p>To those calling an at-grade int ugly pls go get your brain examined or something. I do NOT think having commuters shoved in a dark, stuffy and stinking basement makes the city "world-class". In fact, why not look at what other "world-class" <span style="line-height: 1.231;">cities do! HONG KONG has an open-air at-grade int (which accomodates DD ofc), even for the E-series routes which mainly caters to the ground staff. PARIS has an at-grade int right outside the airport. Let's see, even PENANG wouldnt force bus pax into the basement! Now look at us! Who's not doing it right now, may I ask?</span></p>

              HC buses. Lot of bunching these days... too many buses come
              together... and then you see a gap of 15-20 mins... but that is
              because the way buses leave AMK/WDL back to back. </p>

              <p>a while back, 2 169 comes back to back, both rigids. i wonder the bunching is intentional or what, then this "bus arriving in 5 mins, next bus 20 mins" and " bus departed, next bus 15 mins, subsequent bus 22 mins". what's this?</p>

              <p>904 no need bendies for now. A22 still can handle the load.
              maybe after the HDB along the route has completed, maybe will have
              bendy</p>

              <p>there are many BTOs along the route of 904, so it be soon, adding A22s should be fine for now.</p>
