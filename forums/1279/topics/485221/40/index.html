              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, smrt 965 frequency is nether good. Depends on
              which part of rivervale drive as sbs 85 also goes to rivervale
              drive.</p>
              <p>For those staying in Punggol east and sengkang east, sbs 85 is
              equally fast. Transferring will be slower as 858, 965, 969 are
              usually crowded and you still need another bus service to get to
              TPE and walk across the super long dreaded bridge. By then, sbs 85
              will have been on its way. Anyway sbs 85 has limited stops at
              sengkang east and Punggol east. In less than 8 min, it will have
              covered Punggol east (from Riveria LRT) and sengkang east (up to
              sengkang east road). Cheers.</p>

              <p>Untrue. </p>
              <p>First of all, 85 freq is worse than 965. Try waiting during PM peak, usually 2 965s will pass before you see an 85.</p>
              <p>And no, those staying in Sengkang East do not think 85 is faster. Lemme tell u why. </p>
              <p>After Sengkang East, 85 still has to do merry-go-round at Sengkang Ctrl. Then comes the Sengkang West. Since so many board there it takes time. Then comes Jalan Kayu, where jams frequently occur along the one-lane street. And now, you still have a new additonal traffic light at Seletar Aerospace Flyover. </p>
              <p>86 -&gt; 965, on the other hand, is much faster. Besides, they do not have to cross the bridge as they are in the same direction for 86 -&gt; 965. Both hit the express after the stop! Go and take 965 and see the number of ppl who board 86 after alighting at the first stop off express. You will know when I mean Rivervale ppl like 965, I'm not lying to you.</p>
              <p>And let me tell you what 965 has and 85 doesnt: DDs. Yes... 85 may have them now, but the freq is cut isnt it?! 965 not only has BSEP DDs, even the bus op itself has thrown in one. Definitely solves the crowding problem don't they?</p>
              <p>Perhaps 85 is faster for Sengkang West residents, and perhaps Punggol East if the BC chiongs like 965 BCs do, but I disagree 85 is the first choice to go for everyone along the route. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, your 4th paragraph is certainly not accurate. There are limited stops around sengkang east portion before it arrives at sengkang east rd (near central). I have friends staying there who have bus stops nearby them. They prefer sbs 85 direct to yishun rather than take sbs 86 transfer to smrt 965. Sbs 86 frequency is nether good as well. They don't like to wait for sbs 86 then wait again for smrt 965. Haha. Wait 2 times???</p>
              <p>Your 5th paragraph only applies to sbs 86 -&gt; smrt 965. For the earlier conversation with the other guy, still need to use the overhead Bridge to connect to smrt 858/969. </p>
              <p>Anyway, this sort of comparison is often up to each individual. There is no correct or wrong answer. For sengkang west and Punggol east people, sbs 85 can be faster and avoids inconvenience of transferring and waiting. For sengkang east people, depending on whether that person house is nearer to TPE or having sbs 85 at its doorstep or within 2 min walking distance, it is subjective. Hope that clears the doubt. Cheers. Thanks.  </p>

After the bus stop at sengkang east rd, the journey to khatib/yishun is quite fast. Why still need to take bus to Punggol rd to transfer to smrt 965???</p>

              <p>Because 86 takes too long to get to jalan kayu, it travels one big round to sengkang west therefore ppl take either 85 or 50 to jalan kayu / fernvale from sengkang. Alternatively ppl board 103 from serangoon</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, there is still one more pattern. Sengkang east rd (outside Blk 323B) -khatib mrt/yishun. There is a steady stream of people boarding Sbs 85 at this stop and Everytime SBS 85 crosses to SLE, the bus is seated with more than 20 people on its way to lentor and yishun bus interchange. I have taken many times for joyriding and saw many alight at yishun ave 2. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr smb128B, yes in November 2015. It is coming. With compass point shopping mall undergoing 1 yr renovation, sbs 83 load will temporarily drop at sengkang interchange but expect sharp increase in load at Punggol bus interchange. So coincidental that they plan for compass point renovation to coincide with waterway point mall opening next to Punggol mrt. Think they expect human traffic to fall at the decade old compass point. Cheers.</p>

              <p>So true. sv 50 has an excellent point-to-point connectivity and bi-directional load. See full DDs from Sengkang to YCK road in PM... and again from AMK Ave 5 to Bishan... at least 50-60 pax remain on board after AMK MRT... </p>
