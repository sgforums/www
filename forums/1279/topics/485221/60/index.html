              <p>That is definitely the disadvantage as I pointed out before... but it is a temporary arrangement... so I dont think LTA will introduce a Hillview YT route because of that.</p>

              <p>Thanks if your information is correct. Many times such edits are done and then they turn out to be not true. 966 fleet was said to be 27 buses... then became 24 buses... now 26 buses again... difficult to find the data credible when there are so many fluctuations from one month to another.</p>
              <p>Similarly on 960... it keeps getting added 2 E500s... then someone edits it back to 30 buses... the  it went to 29 buses... then became 30 buses.. and now 32 buses again... So someone is playing mischief (maybe not you... but out of the many changes, there is someone who thinks he has the most right informaiton, and then turns out it wasnt right after all)</p>

              <p>1. 960 has have got the fleet add since end-2013, aka
              <strong>960AP56, 960AP57, 960AP58</strong>, whereby most duties
              <strong>crossover to 913 in the early weekday morning</strong>. But
              has not been confirmed since then because there aren't any daily
              960 bus spotters to varify these additional slots.<br> <br> 2. <strong>960AP59</strong> has been scrapped,
              eliminating the 962A crossover and hence getting a change from
              TIB1142A to SMB5049M. TIB1142A has changed its crossover trip to
              911E in the early weekday morning before performing its trips on
              960, but under another duty slot. Hence, I will continue to keep a
              look out on the deployments under the respective slots especially
              for the Enviro500s. <br> <br> 3. Indeed, 966 has got another fleet add again.
              <strong>SMB3561M</strong> has been seen on a new BSEP slot aka
              <strong>966AP93</strong>, whereby it is finally under an "Official"
              BSEP slot after some time under this service. I have been observing
              that <strong>966AP10</strong> has been receiving either
              <strong>SMB5080X</strong> or <strong>SMB5081T</strong> without
              fail. If I remember correctly, recently the 966 Weekdays schedule
              has have got this description "<strong>Add 2 Reg</strong>" since
              last week. But, no MAN NL323F has been observed to be "kicked out"
              of this service after this fleet add. I will also observe the duty
              slots and deployments on this service too.<br> <br> 4. What do you mean by <br> <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.7111988067627px;"> <em>"I don't think both of this is accurate, and someone is playing

              <p>Sorry... I don't do weekends... that is exclusively family time... week days also my work takes me all over Singapore... so sometimes if I know I am going to a particular area, I plan in advance what routes to do loading analysis on... sometimes ask my driver to go and drop car home for family... while i do some loading before getting back home :) it just helps me destress from work.</p>
