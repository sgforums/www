              <p>Hi mr smb128B, yes in November 2015. It is coming. With compass
              point shopping mall undergoing 1 yr renovation, sbs 83 load will
              temporarily drop at sengkang interchange but expect sharp increase
              in load at Punggol bus interchange. So coincidental that they plan
              for compass point renovation to coincide with waterway point mall
              opening next to Punggol mrt. Think they expect human traffic to
              fall at the decade old compass point. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Its no coincidence. </p>
              <p>Compass point saw it coming. </p>
              <p>They wanted to wait for Seletar Mall and Waterway Point to open first to minimise "damage done"</p>
              <p>Then in tandem to their opening, CP will close right away so as to not waste time</p>
              <p>Its all part of the plan</p>

              <p>I have taken 85 before and it is a myth that Punggol and Sengkang east residents take it to Punggol (even if there are it will be lower unit digi. In my observation, there are distinct loading patterns for sv 85</p>

              <p>Sorry, but I have to disagree with your "distinct loading patterns" with my own experience of loading of svc 85. This is loading on sv 85 on 4th June, at 6.15pm: (I posted this in "Loading levels on buses" thread as well)</p>

              <p>So, if you do some simple calculations:</p>
              <p>1. At Sengkang East Rd, there are still many ppl on the bus who boarded from Punggol. At least 7 pax from Punggol MRT were on the bus before Compassvale Dr, of whom at least 3 pax did not alight until Sengkang East Rd (this is based on the assumption that those who alighted before Sengkang East Rd all boarded at Punggol MRT, which is obviously not true). At least 23 pax from Punggol (including Punggol Ctrl/East) were on the bus before Sengkang East Rd, and not all alighted at Sengkang West or Jln Kayu -- I believe there must be some of them who alighted at Yishun/Khatib. Take note these are the minimum numbers.</p>
              <p>2. 17 pax boarded at Sengkang East but only 2 alighted at Sengkang East Rd. I even doubt that all of them alighted before hitting TPE.</p>
              <p>3. I agree that most ppl taking sv 85 at Sengkang East Rd use it as a feeder to Sengkang West. However, take note that many boarded at Sengkang West towards Yishun also.</p>
              <p>4. There's a good 67 pax on board when reaching Khatib MRT, so I'm afraid the statement "There are few who head to Yishun" is untrue.</p>
              <p>I also thought 85 is an almost useless service before I personally went down to do loading analysis. I was also shocked when some ppl were almost unable to board.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Sorry, but I have to disagree with your "distinct loading
              patterns" with my own experience of loading of svc 85. This is
              loading on sv 85 on 4th June, at 6.15pm: (I posted this in "Loading
              levels on buses" thread as well)</p>
              <p>Punggol Temp Int - 18 (Svc 3 just left 1 min earlier)<br> Punggol Ctrl - [-1] 17, [+5] 22, [-5+3] 20, [-1+6] 25<br> (Note that at least 11 pax who board from interchange have not
              alighted yet)<br> Punggol East - [+6] 31<br> Sengkang East Dr - [-2] 29<br> Sengkang East Way - [-1+3] 31<br> Rivervale Dr - 31, [-1+7] 37<br> Compassvale Dr - [-3+3] 37, [-1+6] 42<br> Sengkang East Rd - [-2+17] 57 (BC had to tell people to move
              in)<br> Sengkang East Way - [+2] 59, [-5?+3] 57, [+2] 59<br> Sengkang West Way - [-1+5] 63 (KUB in opposite direction had 10
              standees), [-6?+6?] 63 (totally lost count, actual pax onboard may
              be slightly smaller but not much difference), [-4?+5?] 64<br> Jln Kayu - [-2+3] 65, [-1+3] 67 (Citaro in opposite direction had
              around 15 standees)<br> Lentor Ave - 67 all the way<br> Yishun Ave 2 - 67, [-26?+2] 43 (Khatib MRT), [-1+1] 43, [-12] 31,
              [-3] 28 (Yishun MRT)<br> Yishun Temp Int - [-28] 0</p>
              <p>So, if you do some simple calculations:</p>
              <p>1. At Sengkang East Rd, there are still many ppl on the bus who
              boarded from Punggol. At least 7 pax from Punggol MRT were on the
              bus before Compassvale Dr, of whom at least 3 pax did not alight
              until Sengkang East Rd (this is based on the assumption that those
              who alighted before Sengkang East Rd all boarded at Punggol MRT,
              which is obviously not true). At least 23 pax from Punggol
              (including Punggol Ctrl/East) were on the bus before Sengkang
              East Rd, and not all alighted at Sengkang West or Jln Kayu -- I
              believe there must be some of them who alighted at Yishun/Khatib.
              Take note these are the minimum numbers.</p>
              <p>2. 17 pax boarded at Sengkang East but only 2 alighted at
              Sengkang East Rd. I even doubt that all of them alighted before
              hitting TPE.</p>
              <p>3. I agree that most ppl taking sv 85 at Sengkang East Rd use it
              as a feeder to Sengkang West. However, take note that many boarded
              at Sengkang West towards Yishun also.</p>
              <p>4. There's a good 67 pax on board when reaching Khatib MRT, so
              I'm afraid the statement "There are few who head to Yishun" is
              untrue.</p>
              <p>I also thought 85 is an almost useless service before I
              personally went down to do loading analysis. I was also shocked
              when some ppl were almost unable to board.</p>

              <p>I think you should read the context in which this discussion was on-going. Few take it to Yishun from Punggol East and Sengkang East. There definitely is catchment from Sengkang East road, Sengkang West Way and Jalan Kayu to Yishun. </p>
