              <p>'morning bro/sis 1333T</p>
              <p>851 did have a period without bendies.</p>
              <p>On the day of CCK handover from SBST to TIBS:</p>
              <p>850X 851T 852R 875A 879P - WLDEP 851 &gt; WLDEP 960</p>
              <p>On that same day 960 was transferred from KJDEP to WLDEP. All
              960 KJDEP bendies (869T. 872H etc) went to 190.</p>
              <p>In this period the ex 851 bendies were replaced by random rigids
              (of all types - O405, Scania 113, UD etc)</p>
              <p>Only during the weekends that 856 bendies (856E, 859Y, 860S,
              861P, 862L etc) did 851 in that period.</p>
              <p>It was after the last of Mark II bendies were registered that
              851 got 3 of them perm:</p>
              <p>997G 999B 1000B &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>These 3 were quickly replaced by 3 Habits (of course after 190
              and 960 got all the new Habits first):</p>
              <p>1042E 1045Y 1046U &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>1045Y were then replaced by 1001Z.</p>
              <p>In this period WLDEP was spamming 851 with Scanias. There were
              not enough O405's to go around and the CAC's were still NAC's.</p>
              <p>849B (perm WLDEP 960) did one trip during late morning post-peak
              on 851 (9am'ish) after doing 856.</p>
              <p>851 was then transferred back to AMDEP, with 859 going the other
              way to WLDEP. As a result 851 got the 2 859 bendies in exchange for
              the 3 in WLDEP:</p>
              <p>1054X 1057M &gt; AMDEP 851</p>
              <p>As the Habit registrations picked up speed that 851 got the 8 or
              so batch preceding the current one:</p>
              <p>1023K 1057M 1081S 1112L 1113J 1114G 1120M 1201M 1137R 1138M</p>
              <p>1120M and 1137R then left for AMDEP 106 with no replacement.
              1201M also left, replaced by 1147L.</p>
              <p>1114G then went to 800, replaced by 976S from 812.</p>
              <p>In this period 1096A, 1097Y, 1098U, 1099S 1198P and 1199L
              cameo'ed on 851 often. 1097Y then went to KJDEP 106. These guys
              were not perm 851 as they did 61/67/854 more than 851.</p>
              <p>In this period AMDEP was spamming 851 with very frequent and
              regular Lance cameo's. 1002X, 1017D and 1018B were perm, with the
              Volgren ones coming from 853. Whenever a bendy is sucked away to
              61/67, it is usually replaced by a Lance or CAC cameo.</p>
              <p>By now all the AMDEP Scania's (including ELBO CAC's) had gone to
              WLDEP (secondary bus types: KJDEP - DAF, WLDEP - Scania, AMDEP -
              Lance). UD's were running between all 3 depots.</p>
              <p>Quite recently when 1023K, 1057M and 1081S left then 1096A and
              1099S replaced them on a perm basis.</p>
              <p>976S then left 851 for good half a year ago or so. Only a few
              weeks ago did 8009J come in.</p>

              <p>Hmm you might remember the pair of Malay drivers driving 851T/999B/1042E/1081S too - the lady driver's name on the name plate was "AS H". The guy was called Saifuddin or something like that. As well as the long white hair chinese uncle wearing a cap on 852R/1001Z. Think they have retired by now.</p>
              <p>Yes I agree that 851 need more HCap buses... not only DD to replace the 7 bendies but additional ones as well. Can cut some SD duties.</p>
              <p>Best if 851 hand over to SBST lah. The way SMRT runs 851 half heartedly sharing its bendies with 856 and also using 851 as a feeder service for 61/67 bendy cameos is totally insincere. SBST will just run it simply as a proper basic trunk service as it should be.</p>

              <p>Yes bro youre correct,Just like 85 case,4 DDs in 5 SDs out..Another possibilities SMRT did trial with 24 buses but end up bunching and low loadings problems which is a wasteful resource for them..The extra 4-5 DDs can be deployed to other svc instead.</p>
              <p>Svc that need more DDs will be:67,106,169,176,187,190,700,856,960,961,963 and 969 for now..Deploy 2-3 units each will be more practical.</p>
              <p>Svc awaiting for DDs(With at least 3 units)</p>
              <p>Svc 167,172,180,184,851,854,855 for now.</p>

              <p>'morning bro/sis 1333T</p>
              <p>851 did have a period without bendies.</p>
              <p>On the day of CCK handover from SBST to TIBS:</p>
              <p>850X 851T 852R 875A 879P - WLDEP 851 &gt; WLDEP 960</p>
              <p>On that same day 960 was transferred from KJDEP to WLDEP. All
              960 KJDEP bendies (869T. 872H etc) went to 190.</p>
              <p>In this period the ex 851 bendies were replaced by random rigids
              (of all types - O405, Scania 113, UD etc)</p>
              <p>Only during the weekends that 856 bendies (856E, 859Y, 860S,
              861P, 862L etc) did 851 in that period.</p>
              <p>It was after the last of Mark II bendies were registered that
              851 got 3 of them perm:</p>
              <p>997G 999B 1000B &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>These 3 were quickly replaced by 3 Habits (of course after 190
              and 960 got all the new Habits first):</p>
              <p>1042E 1045Y 1046U &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>1045Y were then replaced by 1001Z.</p>
              <p>In this period WLDEP was spamming 851 with Scanias. There were
              not enough O405's to go around and the CAC's were still NAC's.</p>
              <p>849B (perm WLDEP 960) did one trip during late morning post-peak
              on 851 (9am'ish) after doing 856.</p>
              <p>851 was then transferred back to AMDEP, with 859 going the other
              way to WLDEP. As a result 851 got the 2 859 bendies in exchange for
              the 3 in WLDEP:</p>
              <p>1054X 1057M &gt; AMDEP 851</p>
              <p>As the Habit registrations picked up speed that 851 got the 8 or
              so batch preceding the current one:</p>
              <p>1023K 1057M 1081S 1112L 1113J 1114G 1120M 1201M 1137R 1138M</p>
              <p>1120M and 1137R then left for AMDEP 106 with no replacement.
              1201M also left, replaced by 1147L.</p>
              <p>1114G then went to 800, replaced by 976S from 812.</p>
              <p>In this period 1096A, 1097Y, 1098U, 1099S 1198P and 1199L
              cameo'ed on 851 often. 1097Y then went to KJDEP 106. These guys
              were not perm 851 as they did 61/67/854 more than 851.</p>
              <p>In this period AMDEP was spamming 851 with very frequent and
              regular Lance cameo's. 1002X, 1017D and 1018B were perm, with the
              Volgren ones coming from 853. Whenever a bendy is sucked away to
              61/67, it is usually replaced by a Lance or CAC cameo.</p>
              <p>By now all the AMDEP Scania's (including ELBO CAC's) had gone to
              WLDEP (secondary bus types: KJDEP - DAF, WLDEP - Scania, AMDEP -
              Lance). UD's were running between all 3 depots.</p>
              <p>Quite recently when 1023K, 1057M and 1081S left then 1096A and
              1099S replaced them on a perm basis.</p>
              <p>976S then left 851 for good half a year ago or so. Only a few
              weeks ago did 8009J come in.</p>

              <p>I think for those in KJDEP, this "trial" arrangement works better. Since they can deploy the MAN Bendies on svcs with existing Merc Bendies &amp; at the same time also have Enviros as perm (eg Sv 106 &amp; 190 with both MB Bendies &amp; Enviros) to compare.</p>
              <p>For AMDEP wise, unless they want to put DDs soon on 851 and 854, the only comparison they can do is compare against those existing MB bendies. Doesn't really do much.</p>
              <p>Maybe that's one of the reasons why AMDEP has been deploying 1218R on 857 &amp; another random Bendy on 857 also recently in the past month. Possibly to cross-check the loadings against those WL-based Enviros on 857..hmm.</p>

              <p>Oh, so the random Bendies from AMDEP on 857 are just to meet the demand during Peak Hours?

              <p>Because that time Amdep didnt have enough bendy buses to play around,Ever since 804 Habits are out,They got at least 4-5 Habit bendy buses to play with thus you see 857 run with at least 2 during peak hours,Sometimes they will even cameo on svc 61,851,854,Feeders,969 frequently.</p>
