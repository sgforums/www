              <p>15 buses were removed from 179 during the 0630-0730 peak period since 26 January. Now, there are 9 buses on 179 during the 0630-0730 peak period. From 2 February, 5 buses will be added (back) to 179 during the 0630-0730.</p>
              <p>As a commuter of 179 myself, and having heard about comments made by other commuters on the bus these days, the response to this removal of 15 buses was, obviously, negative.</p>
              <p>Do you know how many people take 179 every weekday morning between 0630 to 0730? Most of them are students who need to reach school by a certain time. 179 to us is like a feeder service to Pioneer MRT Station. We take it because it provides a faster connection to MRT than 243. Yet, it is operated quite poorly during the 0630-0730 when we need it most.</p>
              <p>Previously, buses come in twos and threes. Now, buses are removed, while buses still come in twos and threes. </p>
              <p>If the removal of 15 buses is to divert the demand for 179 to 243, this is not a good measure. If it is not financially sustainable to have so many buses running 179 all the way into NTU before coming out to serve us, the possible alternatives are</p>
              <p>1. short-working trip of 179 to connect Pioneer Road North to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>2. new bus connection between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 71 and Jurong West Street 81.</p>
              <p>I believe when LTA reads the data from Ez-link carders, they would observe that there is a relatively large number of people taking bus service 179 and 241 from Pioneer Road North to Pioneer MRT Station, and a sizeable number of people who takes 243G, alights at that bus stop at Pioneer Road North and take 179/241/241A to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>If LTA sends its people down to Jurong West Street 61 and Jurong West Street 71 during morning peak hour, they should observe that there is a significant number of people walking from Jurong West Street 71 to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>There is a sustainable demand for a bus connection between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 71, 81 and 91. While there is 241 serving Jurong West Street 91, there is no bus service serving Jurong West Street 71 and 81 – except 179 and 241 along Pioneer Road North.</p>

              <p>Hold your horses bro. I shall reserve judgement till i see an actual change in the e-timetable for Sv 518 online. Because the other time they replaced 2699Y with 3818P, they did a e-tt update on the day 3818P went to Sv 518.</p>
              <p>So I suppose the same would happen if they added a second DD to Sv 518 this time round. Just a case in point though, both Striders (2626H &amp; 2653D) are still on Sv 518 consistently this past week.</p>
              <p>So again, I presume the other DD cameo isn't on a fixed slot these few days. Seems to be them testing the loading for a second DD, without fixing a slot for it yet (or decide which bus to kick out). </p>

              <p>Hold your horses bro. I shall reserve judgement till i see an
              actual change in the e-timetable for Sv 518 online. Because the
              other time they replaced 2699Y with 3818P, they did a e-tt update
              on the day 3818P went to Sv 518.</p>
              <p>So I suppose the same would happen if they added a second DD to
              Sv 518 this time round. Just a case in point though, both Striders
              (2626H &amp; 2653D) are still on Sv 518 consistently this past
              week.</p>
              <p>So again, I presume the other DD cameo isn't on a fixed slot
              these few days. Seems to be them testing the loading for a second
              DD, without fixing a slot for it yet (or decide which bus to kick
              out). </p>

              <p>I am hoping LTA introduced full day 858M between Woodlands and Khatib MRT - the loading does justify a M service to be introduced. This service should surely ply DDs. Also with more BTOs opening along WDL Ave 9, 858 is not able to tank the load during peak hours. In many ways, it is a very unique route with very few alternatives for commuters. </p>

              <p>I think 980 cannot coz of Lor 1 terminal. Same reason why 985 also cannot. But 167 they should consider deploying 3 DDs on S-shift. Loading in AM very high, and bus already full by the time arrives at Springleaf. Beyond AMK, there are other alternatives but at Springleaf, before YCK road - people rely solely on 167 and 980. </p>

              <p>My personal observation after years taking 858</p>
              <p>AM peak Woodlands not crowded but SBW n after Yishun MRT to CGA is damn crowded.</p>
              <p>PM peak CGA area can packed to the door wich caused bunching at airport at times, Then it will be packed until Khatib/Yishun MRT where it will offload alot of pax but there are alot of people boarding there also but most of the pax from CGA are long distance traveller who is not willing to alight n take 168 at Jln Kayu.</p>
              <p>N yes i had times i cant board 858 during PM peak at Yishun so i take the next one most of the time</p>

              <p>15 buses were removed from 179 during the 0630-0730 peak period
              since 26 January. Now, there are 9 buses on 179 during the
              0630-0730 peak period. From 2 February, 5 buses will be added
              (back) to 179 during the 0630-0730.</p>
              <p>As a commuter of 179 myself, and having heard about comments
              made by other commuters on the bus these days, the response to this
              removal of 15 buses was, obviously, negative.</p>
              <p>Do you know how many people take 179 every weekday morning
              between 0630 to 0730? Most of them are students who need to reach
              school by a certain time. 179 to us is like a feeder service to
              Pioneer MRT Station. We take it because it provides a faster
              connection to MRT than 243. Yet, it is operated quite poorly during
              the 0630-0730 when we need it most.</p>
              <p>Previously, buses come in twos and threes. Now, buses are
              removed, while buses still come in twos and threes. </p>
              <p>If the removal of 15 buses is to divert the demand for 179 to
              243, this is not a good measure. If it is not financially
              sustainable to have so many buses running 179 all the way into NTU
              before coming out to serve us, the possible alternatives are</p>
              <p>1. short-working trip of 179 to connect Pioneer Road North to
              Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>2. new bus connection between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong
              West Street 71 and Jurong West Street 81.</p>
              <p>I believe when LTA reads the data from Ez-link carders, they
              would observe that there is a relatively large number of people
              taking bus service 179 and 241 from Pioneer Road North to Pioneer
              MRT Station, and a sizeable number of people who takes 243G,
              alights at that bus stop at Pioneer Road North and take
              179/241/241A to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>If LTA sends its people down to Jurong West Street 61 and Jurong
              West Street 71 during morning peak hour, they should observe that
              there is a significant number of people walking from Jurong West
              Street 71 to Pioneer MRT Station.</p>
              <p>There is a sustainable demand for a bus connection between
              Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 71, 81 and 91. While
              there is 241 serving Jurong West Street 91, there is no bus service
              serving Jurong West Street 71 and 81 – except 179 and 241 along
              Pioneer Road North.</p>
              <p>There should be a bus service between Pioneer MRT Station and
              Jurong West Street 71 and 81.</p>
              </div>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Actually, there is no need for svc 179 to operate at 3-5
              minutes interval, between 0630-0730. There is basically not so much people
              heading in and out NTU, or the loading along Pioneer Rd Nth, does not justify the need to operate at such frequency with the
              presence of Service 241.  A more appropriate frequency at 5 to 7
              mins should be good enough to cater the crowd and reduce the instances of
              bunching.</p>

              <p>I will not support usage of DD on 172. And recently 172 seems to be getting more bendy cameos from 190 bendys and I hope 172 gets more bendy buses as 190 takes in the E500s.</p>
              <p>On most of 172's route, there is only 172 and I would say it would be a economic waste to maintain the trees along the long stretch to just accomodate 172 DDs. Secondly the route of 172 does not have any congestion except at BL interchange but most of the day there is only 1 bendy bus for 172 parked inside at any time because 172 fleet is not 100% bendy. Thirdly, with the types of people (NSFs with heavy &amp; bulky bags, people just travelling from BL-Jln Bahar, People travelling from CCK Ave 1 to CCK int), DDs will not ever have a good utility rate.</p>

              <p>SMB3568U in, SMB3061P out... I suspect 3061P will go along with 3062L &amp; 3063J from 67 to CCK 301 or 983, that is if 67 also gets DDs...</p>

              <p>I am sure 67 will get DDs. and feel the AMDEP BSEP slot might get transferred to KJDEP as well. </p>
              <p>This wat 4 SP MANA22 for 301/983 from 966/67 + another 7 SP from 972.</p>
              <p>So now in total KJDEP will have 11-12 SP MANA22 to deploy on 301/983. </p>
