              <p>sv 188 needs to kick out some SDs and replace with DDs. Hopefully the SMRT KJDEP SP E500s will go to 188 now.</p>

              <p>I will not support usage of DD on 172. And recently 172 seems to be getting more bendy cameos from 190 bendys and I hope 172 gets more bendy buses as 190 takes in the E500s.</p>
              <p>On most of 172's route, there is only 172 and I would say it would be a economic waste to maintain the trees along the long stretch to just accomodate 172 DDs. Secondly the route of 172 does not have any congestion except at BL interchange but most of the day there is only 1 bendy bus for 172 parked inside at any time because 172 fleet is not 100% bendy. Thirdly, with the types of people (NSFs with heavy &amp; bulky bags, people just travelling from BL-Jln Bahar, People travelling from CCK Ave 1 to CCK int), DDs will not ever have a good utility rate.</p>

              <p>Not really leh i feel. There is a significant number of passengers who will take from Boon Lay to CCK Ave 3 (Blk 464) and Ave 1. During AM peak, buses (rigid and sometimes bendies) will be full by the first stop along Ave1, and most of these passengers will take to at least Jalan Bahar or even Boon Lay Int...</p>
              <p>And no! 172 only gets bendy cameos from service like 106 and 190 (can tell from my cameo list) but number of bendies are still the same (constantly on slots 172S102, 172S103, 172S105 and 172S107). There were a few times i saw a bendy on AP slot but then recently no more again...not sure if SMRT had felt that the 4 bendies from split were enough...</p>

              <p>even during peak hours, I have observed that people alight from 199 at stop after PIE... and the buses coming from Boon Lay are already full. Sometimes really makes you wonder - what is SMRT doing?</p>
              <p>I am sure many people who can afford will buy cars, if you are offered such poor service. Highly recommend some of the bendies that come from other services like 190, 963 to be deployed on 172.</p>

              <p>Seems like sv 50 got one more WEG fleet add from HGDEP. 3418K also posted to sv 50. Now fleet is 17 buses. I think when introduced was 14 buses with 09 DDs and 05 SDs. Now 2 years later, fleet is 17 buses with 13 DDs, 04 SDs. </p>
              <p>I think sv 50 might need another BSEP add soon, and 2 more SD slots converting to DD.</p>
              <p>Noticed loading increase at Bishan for sv 50. Now students, industrial workers coming from CCL get down at Bishan and take sv 50 instead of changing and alighting at AMK or YCK. This could explain the increase in loading IMO. </p>

              <p>Never really see it happen before. Full SD (seated) towards int, I might have seen before, but never a full SD. It also have 20 and 39 to move the pax towards Ave 2 side. Cannot in that 15 mins, no 20/39 comes along.</p>
              <p>But if 292 serve St 11 on both directions, could be different story.</p>

              <p>I think issue will be better when sv 39 gets DDs with opening of Yishun next month, and sv 20 needs 1 or 2 more SD slots converted to DD. The Tampines-Simei loading is not that bad, while Simei-CBP loading during peak hours is very good and going on increasing.</p>

              <p>i live along tamp ave 2 and bus along this av i observe most. i can tell frm experience no need for dd on 292. yes sometime crowded but most time u have bus svc 20 or bus svc 39. b4 bus svc 20 came into picture okay 292 needed more bus. but not now.</p>
              <p>also from personal experience know people prefer svc 20 and svc 39 to svc 292 because it is slow and take more time. unless for peop living inside st 11 or st 22. </p>
