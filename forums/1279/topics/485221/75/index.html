              <p>Just like how many can spam so many posts about the bendy

                      979 today. Even saying SMRT's BSEP services never get
                      boring... Trying to cover up the fact that 979 has majority
                      rigid fleet?</p>
              <p>On the contrary, 118 is full fleet DD since its 1st day and

              <p>I'm not sure whether you will say you are a bus enthusiast, but judging by your presence here, I'm sure you are. But nonetheless, if you or any other persons want to see yourself as an unrelated self styled transport/urban planning analyst, then at least get down from whatever ivory tower you are in and recognise that there are bus enthuasists who are not plainly obsessed with a certain company without any justification.</p>
              <p>The fact is, while the pro SMRT camp here usually have to work harder to come out with reasonable, justified arguments, the pro SBS camp here likes to attack SMRT and their supporters without really giving justifications, or giving justifications based on SMRT's performance in the past. Its bad when an LTA decision on fleet allocation becomes a blame game against SMRT.</p>
              <p>Yes, if you say 5 years ago, I will agree that SMRT is not as good as SBS. But over the past 5 years, SMRT has been the one at the forefront of implementing customer oriented initiatives, especially the past year. SMRT had been the only one engaging the public regarding buses, and has upgraded using their own resources, a number of bsep services.</p>
              <p>Sure, there is room for improvement from SMRT, but some are deriding it, saying not enough or giving the same old its useless etc, but instead of demanding it to appear instantly, how about wait and see. I would suppose even SBS and SMRT themselves are waiting and see, especially in unchartered territories for the bus industry.</p>

              <p>Explain:</p>
              <p>1. Why 187 has so many A22s added when Sd--&gt;DD would have done the job keeping the fleet at 25/26 buses instead of 31? And then you cry about shortage of BCs.</p>
              <p>2. Explain why 854 still has so many rigids, when its counterpart 25 for most part of its route is almost full fleet DD?</p>
              <p>3. Explain why service levels on Yishun/Woodlands feeders/intra towns is so poor with so many rigids stormed on 811, 911 when HC buses would do the job with lesser fleet.</p>
              <p>You know there is a big list that I can go on... It is only because of LTA/BSEP that you saw services like 61, 961, 985 get more HC buses. </p>

              <p>It is not just DDs and Bendies against rigids. Frequency and time periods also play a part. Mindlessly spamming rigids, DDs and bendies is never going to work.

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Then there's a release of DDs enhancement...and the quantity was stated also iirc...</span></p>
              <p>But SMRT ownself added 1 DD as there's high demand at the last few stops...you ownself also acknowledge the capacity upgrade last time when I've mentioned...</p>
              <p>If not, look at 982E. From SMRT effort, they deployed bendy buses on 982E PM peak as a trial(from what some enthus mentioned) to see if there's a need for improvements. </p>
              <p>Anyway, didn't you (guys) mentioned of not to be complaining? How come you guys are complaining about SMRT again? Wow? </p>

              <p>Whose fault? Wasn't it poor planning on SMRT part?</p>
              <p>Since you are an advocate for SMRT.</p>
              <p>Explain:</p>
              <p>1. Why 187 has so many A22s added when Sd--&gt;DD would have
              done the job keeping the fleet at 25/26 buses instead of 31? And
              then you cry about shortage of BCs.</p>
              <p>2. Explain why 854 still has so many rigids, when its
              counterpart 25 for most part of its route is almost full fleet
              DD?</p>
              <p>3. Explain why service levels on Yishun/Woodlands feeders/intra
              towns is so poor with so many rigids stormed on 811, 911 when HC
              buses would do the job with lesser fleet.</p>
              <p>You know there is a big list that I can go on... It is only
              because of LTA/BSEP that you saw services like 61, 961, 985 get
              more HC buses. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Like you mentioned HC buses would do the job with lesser fleet...how come ppl still complain that SMRT downgraded slots when DD are added? </p>
              <p>Yes although 911 have more SDs spammed, it does a pretty much decent job in having much <strong>regular</strong> frequency. When you deploy more HC buses, what's the point when the frequency is also crap? </p>

              <p>Well, basically it's about SMRT the deployment of HC buses...</p>

              <p>Personally, I believe different operators have different way of deploying. </p>
              <p>But I see no harm in deploying full fleet SDs on the first day, and improving from there on. At least you act accordingly.</p>
              <p>Take a look at 102, still poor demand I guess? Some even mentioned of waste of resources. Now, there's so many "fortune teller" here eh? So fast assumed that 117 would need FULL FLEET DDs by 2017. Yes I know the Aviation industry is expanding, but still, you can't assume things so early. </p>
              <p>And YES SMRT might have ordered too many A22s, but I believe they would be in good use when there's train disruptions? <strong>So what if they spam more SDs rather than putting HC buses? It's creating more job opportunities, MORE RELAX Timing for drivers, LESSER chance of being late. </strong></p>
              <p>If you wish for a world class transportation, you not only need to have good(maintained) buses, but happy drivers. Not a situation where they are always rushing to meet schedules. Also, interchanges and depot should have more land space. </p>
