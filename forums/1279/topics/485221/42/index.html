              <p>I do not have an answer to that but looking at the way SMRT puts especially 851 as least priority, I'd say DD's will only appear on these 2 guys when there are not enough bendies left due to retirement.</p>
              <p>There are now quite a number of SP bendies in AMDEP now due to the WABisation of 804 using A24's and also the odd replacement of Habit with A24 in 812, 851 and 854.</p>

              <p>By the way, SMRT should not leave 851 with just SD and bendies all the way just because its fully AMDEP and AMDEP cannot take in Enviros.

              <p>8009J is perm sv 851 that's why you see A24s... No sign of DD for 851 yet... It's a pity given that even 961 now has perm DD. Has to do with all AMDEP slot, and not getting part depot transfer.</p>

              <p>Yes...Should give some of 851's duties to WPDEP. Peak loading quite high on 851 between Ang Mo Kio and Chinatown and the also it serves many hospitals such as kk and sgh and thus, the high passenger demand throughout the day so don't see why SMRT sees 851 as "low priority route" like what the user AntiDennisLance said...hopefully 851 will get some DDs it deserves...</p>

              <p>Just 1 Bus under WPDEP for 851? Should kick some OCs for Enviros too and leave the bendies untouched. IMO should get at least 3-4 buses including a BSEP addition for a start.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, smrt 972 is a doorstep service for many bukit panjang residents compared to SMRT 190. More 'doorstep' than ever. People really cherish minimal walking. Cheers.</p>

              <p>some ppl rather take 972 from Blk 604 as they can secure seats. Also, 972 promises a full DD fleet</p>

              <p>Yes...Should give some of 851's duties to WPDEP. Peak loading
              quite high on 851 between Ang Mo Kio and Chinatown and the also it
              serves many hospitals such as kk and sgh and thus, the high
              passenger demand throughout the day so don't see why SMRT sees 851

              <p>Yes I also agree that 851 deserves better.. but history does indicate that TIBS/SMRT doesnt think 851 is a big deal:</p>
              <p>- When 190 was taken over by TIBS, all 960 bendies went to 190 and all 851 bendies went to 960. 851 had no bendies at all for a long while</p>
              <p>- Spam of Dennis Lances on 851</p>
              <p>- After bendy fleet was rebuilt back up to only 7 (most on S rather than A/P anyway - seldom see a bendy after 7pm), it is now reduced to 6 after 976S left</p>
              <p>- It still maintains a majority fleet of the oldest WAB buses (O500's) and has not seen a fleet renewal for some time (though personally I dont find anything wrong or bad with the O500's)</p>
              <p>- The 851 bendies are shared with 856 on morning peaks i.e. not totally dedicated bendies</p>
              <p>- Whenever other more favoured services lack bendies (e.g. 61, 67), 851 bendies are always the first ones to be pulled away for cameos</p>

              <p>During the switch for Bukit Batok &amp; Choa Chu Kang; they only care about the MRT/bus rationalisation, never check the popular demand of the bus service 190. 190 was sadly downgraded, how I wish if it is privatised, and after 2009 (the removal of bendy buses), it could become 53 double deckers.</p>

              <p>"I am writing about your suggestion of 22 June to deploy double

              for sharing your suggestions with us, we look forward to provide
              better travelling experiences."</span></p>
              <p>By the way, SMRT should not leave 851 with just SD and bendies
              all the way just because its fully AMDEP and AMDEP cannot take in
              Enviros. If can, they can let WPDEP to take partially controlled of
              851 temporarily before Seletar Depot is completed in Q3 2017. Also,
              AMDEP will be closed in 2016 right?</p>

              <p>Normally if you get this kind of reply.. it is because they are planning to launch.. same happened when I had written about 145... they said are evaluating... and will make necessary changes... and shortly in 2-3 weeks 3 DDs were introduced on 145</p>

              <p>Loading on 972 is v high. Every DD in AM (unless bunches at BPJ ring road) gets 80-90 pax at Fajar. Some come to BPJ road with +100 pax. </p>
              <p>972 has a direct catchment for BPJ ring road, who would earlier have to change to 700 at interchange. Hence, loading on 700 has dropped a bit, but 190/972 are very crowded.</p>
              <p>Also take into account that huge number of HDB blocks have opened ever since the 190 video posted 2 years back. All these blocks mostly are along Ring road. More blocks are getting constructed and will be operational. Senja/Segar/Fajar all have new blocks launched in 2014/2015/2016. </p>
              <p>Hope this explains!!</p>

                          few to get bendies) and never got spammed with lances before... it
                          was majority o405s until the OCs came, and had 14 bendies at that
                          time.. (with quite a few AP)</p>
              <p>however as the OCs came, smrt then began to reduce the bendies
                          to 9.. and now to 7, mainly also because to cope with WAB status
                          (tho i dont understand why they still have not added DDs now when
                          SMRT alr has more WAB HC Buses)</p>
              <p>and the OCs are also better than having MAN A22s, as they have
                          higher capacity</p>
              <p>fyi...976S was replaced by 8009J, so is still 7</p>
              <p>anw i have feedback to smrt abt 851, so hopefully we will see a
                          change soon :)</p>

              <p>'morning bro/sis 1333T</p>
              <p>851 did have a period without bendies.</p>
              <p>On the day of CCK handover from SBST to TIBS:</p>
              <p>850X 851T 852R 875A 879P - WLDEP 851 &gt; WLDEP 960</p>
              <p>On that same day 960 was transferred from KJDEP to WLDEP. All 960 KJDEP bendies (869T. 872H etc) went to 190.</p>
              <p>In this period the ex 851 bendies were replaced by random rigids (of all types - O405, Scania 113, UD etc)</p>
              <p>Only during the weekends that 856 bendies (856E, 859Y, 860S, 861P, 862L etc) did 851 in that period.</p>
              <p>It was after the last of Mark II bendies were registered that 851 got 3 of them perm:</p>
              <p>997G 999B 1000B &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>These 3 were quickly replaced by 3 Habits (of course after 190 and 960 got all the new Habits first):</p>
              <p>1042E 1045Y 1046U &gt; WLDEP 851</p>
              <p>1045Y were then replaced by 1001Z.</p>
              <p>In this period WLDEP was spamming 851 with Scanias. There were not enough O405's to go around and the CAC's were still NAC's.</p>
              <p>849B (perm WLDEP 960) did one trip during late morning post-peak on 851 (9am'ish) after doing 856.</p>
              <p>851 was then transferred back to AMDEP, with 859 going the other way to WLDEP. As a result 851 got the 2 859 bendies in exchange for the 3 in WLDEP:</p>
              <p>1054X 1057M &gt; AMDEP 851</p>
              <p>As the Habit registrations picked up speed that 851 got the 8 or so batch preceding the current one:</p>
              <p>1023K 1057M 1081S 1112L 1113J 1114G 1120M 1201M 1137R 1138M</p>
              <p>1120M and 1137R then left for AMDEP 106 with no replacement. 1201M also left, replaced by 1147L.</p>
              <p>1114G then went to 800, replaced by 976S from 812.</p>
              <p>In this period 1096A, 1097Y, 1098U, 1099S 1198P and 1199L cameo'ed on 851 often. 1097Y then went to KJDEP 106. These guys were not perm 851 as they did 61/67/854 more than 851.</p>
              <p>In this period AMDEP was spamming 851 with very frequent and regular Lance cameo's. 1002X, 1017D and 1018B were perm, with the Volgren ones coming from 853. Whenever a bendy is sucked away to 61/67, it is usually replaced by a Lance or CAC cameo.</p>
              <p>By now all the AMDEP Scania's (including ELBO CAC's) had gone to WLDEP (secondary bus types: KJDEP - DAF, WLDEP - Scania, AMDEP - Lance). UD's were running between all 3 depots.</p>
              <p>Quite recently when 1023K, 1057M and 1081S left then 1096A and 1099S replaced them on a perm basis.</p>
              <p>976S then left 851 for good half a year ago or so. Only a few weeks ago did 8009J come in.</p>
