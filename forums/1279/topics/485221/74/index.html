              <p><strong>This is SBST v/s SMRT</strong></p>
              <p>SBST will deploy DDs even on services that do not need them and
              SMRT will play cheap and deploy their sucky MANA22s even when DDs
              are needed.</p>
              <p>On day 1 of operation, SBST launched DDs on services that could
              have done without DDs such as :</p>
              <p>41 &gt; you can argue DDs are doing okay, but that's just bcoz
              it duplicates 183 route. The Beauty World section is just SD
              seating loading. Now with Beauty World MRT opening, loading could
              improve. But DDs were given year in advance.</p>
              <p>201 &gt; The DDs are doing well in the old 189 route, but the
              Clementi - Pandan is purely SD seating loading, yet when 201 got
              fleet add to improve frequency, it was DD instead of SD.</p>
              <p>119 &gt; The classic example of 3 years of wasted DD resources.
              119 was expected to get heavy loading because of boom in flats in
              Punggol West and being the only service, but guess what, it never
              got more than 40 (99% times) bet Punggol/Sengkang. Still SBST
              continues to have those DDs.</p>
              <p>102 &gt; Another example of DDs wasted. The route b/w Hougang
              and Sengkang fetches at max 20-30 pax, could get to 50 pax for
              Sengkang-Sengkang west. Manageable by Citaros, but 50% fleet DD
              from day 1.</p>
              <p>47 &gt; Need to still evaluate if service needs DDs, could need
              for TNM-CBP, but again SBST decided to give DDs from day 1 instead
              of monitoring loading</p>
              <p>117 &gt; This route in future needs to be full fleet DD, but
              this would be only in 2017 given the huge number of flats in
              Punggol West, Yishun Ave 1, Canberra. But DDs get kicked in a year
              before. </p>
              <p><strong>Now, lets look at SMRT</strong></p>
              <p>860 &gt; Such a high loading route. No HC buses and 16 buses
              have to be operated for such a short route, due to non-deployment
              of HC buses. Now have 1 MANdy.</p>
              <p>979 &gt; It was clear that DDs are required, but SMRT decided to
              play cheap and operate only MANA22s</p>
              <p>983 &gt; If this was SBST route, it would be full fleet DD. But
              no, once again play cheap by deploying A22s that cannot tank the
              ave 5 loading</p>
              <p>301 &gt; will need bendies from now on, but guess what SMRT will
              give it none, and just go on adding A22s.</p>
              <p>No wonder 117 was given to SBST bcoz guess what if SMRT had it,
              it would be full fleet A22. </p>
              </div>

              <p>The type of buses used for BSEP services are determined by LTA, SBS and SMRT just run the services based on what is given.</p>
              <p>In fact, SMRT probably saw that LTA's arrangement was not as efficient as their own services and decided to intervene by putting their own bendy buses which are more efficient for the kind of routes you've listed. This is a customer oriented move by SMRT and they should be commended for going beyond what was required of them.</p>
              <p>301 doesn't need bendies, its perpetually emptier than most bus services around and would do fine with the current fleet.</p>

              <p>Sorry... maybe you work for SMRT and feel protective here... but the reason LTA must be giving HC buses on SBST services is because they have it... whereas SMRT is still scrambling on its own services.</p>
              <p>Explain sv 187 getting constant HC downgrade and in turn A22s just get added like no ones business to tank the load. On one hand we talk about shortage of BCs, on the other hand, they just add rigids instead of doing the smart thing of upgrading SD--&gt;DD. </p>
              <p>SMRT has a big role to play why the deployment of HC buses on its feeders/intratowns/trunks is so messed up. SBST on the other hand is more than liberal even when not needed to give HC buses. There is a disconnect.</p>

              <p>I think 301 will need bendies or massive fleet add. The HDB at Keat Hong Close is huge equivalent to the one along ave 5. If 983 needed capacity add to take care of ave 5 HDB, for sure 301 will need as well.</p>
              <p>But let me guess. SMRT will not give any HC bus and in turn just go on adding A22s to 301.</p>

              <p>I am not against that approach. It makes sense. But you also need better judgment. You cannot start sv 50, 118 or 972 with no HC buses. It is a must.</p>
              <p>For me 4 and 20 still needed to make their ground. It required Flora residents to abondon its private shuttle and similar for sv 20, people had to change their travel pattern. I am happy SBST has done the right thing by upgrading both these services.</p>
              <p>For me, 979 was a no brainer - should have been 50% HC fleet from day 1. </p>

              <p>SMRT is the only one that make mistakes for the massive A22 orders. Secondly, the A24 bendy buses can only be deployed to the rural areas for e.g. 180, 184, 859, 860, 962, 964. That is why SMRT is still helping on the trend of bendies. Its bendy buses were reduced on 106 and 190 but demolished on the 963 side.</p>
              <p>If Sungei Seletar were to replace Ang Mo Kio Depot, then more areas would be perfectly fine.</p>
