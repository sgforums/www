              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, not confirmed yet to be 15 min. Don't be so
              pessimistic. Passengers at yishun of course will continue to take
              smrt 965 if going to sengkang. If going to Punggol, they will take
              sbs 117. So your statement of passengers at yishun will choose 965
              because it goes by expressway is not clear. Note smrt 965 goes
              sengkang while sbs 117 goes Punggol. Clearly the catchment of
              people is different. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>965 uses the expressway, it's much faster. Yes although the destination is different, as of now, ppl take 965 would mostly alight within Sengkang. </p>
              <p>Thus, 117 wouldn't really impact 965 slightly. It's only the minor few. And, I am sure those minor few usually would prefer 965 &gt; 83, since it could stop directly at their house. (Since they need to transfer either way, might as well take bus 965 which uses the expressway).</p>

              <p>Not saying the expy is slow. But the expy is indeed overly congested. Given the choice, Punggol residents would probably choose the road right at their doorstep, instesd of going down and cramming together with the rest of north east.</p>

              <p>But fortrip to SKG during PM hrs, it's somewhat better to take 965 than 117. </p>
              <p>I tried travelling on TPE during PM peak..from Wdl to Sengkang..still alright. It's usually the part along SLE, before Yishun that's having some jams. And the slip road into TPE from SLE. </p>
              <p>Punggol Rd Exit usually affects the opposite site. Slip road to SLE also have jams sometimes..but seldom now due to wider road. </p>
              <p>Unless Sv117 take 1 big loop liike sv83 does, maybe it might help the residents to get home directly. Otherwise, still need to transfer bus at punggol, never run expressway.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, sengkang people continue to take smrt 965 (as before) and Punggol people take sbs 117. Transferring inside Punggol bus interchange is much seamless than 965-&gt;83/136. Nobody likes to go to punggol road to walk across a bridge to transfer 83/136. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

Those living along Punggol Dr/Field can take 50/62/LRT and transfer to 117. This is where 965 will lose its pax who used to take 83 and cross over-head bridge to take 965 or take 3 and cross the long bridge along TPE to take 969</p>
              <p>103 - Those who live at HDBs along Sengkang West / Jalan Kayu + YCK road to Yishun</p>
              <p>-----</p>
              <p>Another consideration is on Yishun side. Those wanting to go to ring road/ave 1/ave 11 have now a direct service in form of 103 or 117 near its door step. </p>
              <p>So overall, I believe 103 and 117 will get heavy loading because of SAP + development of Sengkang West/Punggol town</p>
              <p>85 loading will get increase in loading due to higher occupancy in Sengkang West town offset by alternative options such as 103 (SGK West) / 117 (Punggol East).</p>
              <p>965 is the one whose loading will get majorly affected due to reduction in those who transfer at Punggol road, will now do with 117 at interchange + those who alight at Sengkang via MRT to take 965, can now also choose to alight at Punggol. In AM, people will prefer 117 even more as can get seat in Punggol for MRT. </p>

              <p>But extension of 102 not announced yet. Once it does to East Camp, I do see loading improving a bit. But East Camp industrial estate is still under construction, so mostly can expect loading to increase from Q2/Q3 2016. </p>

              <p>I shall show a live demonstration early next week and maybe few months later the exact timing why sbs 85 is still trusted to be depended upon for a guy (Riveria LRT along Punggol east to khatib mrt) and if he takes bus to Punggol interchange to switch to sbs 117 and alight at khatib mrt too. </p>
              <p>Maybe if he takes direct bus sbs 85, it will be about 5 min later than 3/83/85-&gt; sbs 117. </p>
              <p>Starting stop: bus stop outside Riveria LRT</p>
              <p>Ending stop: bus stop outside khatib mrt.</p>
              <p>Choice 1: direct sbs 85 (20 stops from Riveria LRT to khatib mrt)</p>
              <p>Choice 2: 3/83/85 (5 stops from Riveria LRT to Punggol bus int) transfer sbs 117 (19 stops to khatib MRT). Total 24 stops plus waiting time for transfer. </p>
              <p>It seems choice 2 will be faster but maybe not by too much. People always tend to forget or discount the time you need incur waiting when you transfer. This is why when people type, it seems easy to think one way. However, reality is what we depend upon. </p>

              Or choice 3: 83 to Punggol Road, Blk 190C, 5 stops, around 10 mins.
              Cross overhead bridge, around 1 min.
              Take 965 to Bef Khatib Stn, 5 stops, around 15-20 mins.

              <p>Hi mr Sbs6750E, I doubt choice 1 and choice 2 will take long excluding waiting time. The last time I took sbs 85 directly from Riveria LRT to khatib is only 33 min. People may always think sbs 85 takes a long loop. Yes I agree. But they never take into account the bus is damn fast and the next stop after Riveria LRT is already sengkang. They also did not take into account transferring to other services need waiting time. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, I think no. LTA intentionally wants make sbs 117

              and Punggol way and straight out to TPE. It also purposely avoided

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, sengkang people continue to take smrt 965 (as

              <p>Anyway, let's just see the svc during and after a few months of introduction. </p>
              <p>Base on my ride on 965 :</p>
              <p><strong>TO Wdl :</strong><br>Sengkang Int usually 1 big chunk, along the way, some alight/board. <br>Reaching Khatib/Yishun, mostly alight. At Yishun, all the Admiralty/Wdl ppl board(can be packed). Yishun Av7 also some ppl board. </p>
              <p><strong>TO Skg :</strong><br>Blk825, Adm Stn have demands. Yishun Av7/2 have Yishun/Sengkang residents boarding. Followed by Yishun Stn/Khatib. Mostly alight along the way in Sengkang, will left a little when entering Sengkang Int. </p>
              <p>If you talking about pax. going to Punggol to take NEL down, I don't agree fully. <strong>Most</strong> passengers did not "bounce train"(take to Punggol and back) just for seats at Sengkang, even with buses connecting Punggol directly).</p>
              <p>While there's an option for them to head to Punggol, it usually depends. But I would say if their ride on 965 gets into traffic jams commonly, they will switch to 117.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">BUT, if their ride on 965 doesn't experience traffic jams, they will stick to 965 because it's faster(expressway VS stopping at Seletar etc). </span></p>
              <p>Definitely, 117 might attract more ppl(working at Seletar) to buy the upcoming Canberra HDBs near Canberra Stn. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, I stayed inside. I understood the frustration of indirect bus services. Many people feedbacked to me. They do not like walking across the super long bridge to transfer to service at TPE stop. They also do not like walking across bridge at pungogl road. Maybe it is the lack of bus services during the heydays in Punggol that built up that feeling. If I do not have people feedbacking this to me, I will definitely not write it out. From what you write, I perceive you do not stay inside and you do not understand the frustration of what we have been experiencing. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, I think LTA is right not to use sbs 117 to link up west and east Punggol. Certain parts of Punggol east can still take buses to interchange to transfer to sbs 117 while certain parts can still take sbs 85 directly (albeit with a 5-10 min more). It is intended more for punggol west as a faster alternative. When I wrote the above why LTA avoided to ply punggol east and sengkang, it already signifies their intention to make it a direct service but you want it to connect a portion of punggol field (east) which is contrary to their original intention. So you need to read it in a wider context as a whole. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, I am just using the bridge as an example. Okay since you are bent on picking on the word 'nobody', I shall use 'very little' next time. As long as most readers understand the issues and reasonings I put across, it is okay to me. As for those who live inside punggol, they will understand the ease of transfer inside Punggol int. Even for some other forumers who do not live inside, they understood. </p>
              <p>Okay I shall put it this way so that you cannot pick on my words. There are some ways for majority of people to circumvent ways of not using the bridge. It is not whether I like it or not. </p>
              <p>Peace. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
