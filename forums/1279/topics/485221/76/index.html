              <p>All are long distance routes, and long distance routes are prone to enroute conditions. I mean in the East, even 23 and 65 faces the same issues of late arrival and bunching, maybe it doesn't affect you or maybe the sector you take has alternatives.</p>

              <p>r u stupid o wat. i live in tamp. and i live along route of 39.
              u compare 969 and 39. do u even kno the dd on 39 not get use well.
              969 got so much demand yet got so many rigid ply. i agree with some
              969 shud be full fleet dd. and where 965 got 5-8 min freq. u dream
              o wat.</p>
              <p>and if 969 can no compare to 168 how u compare to 39. 39 is for
              pasir ris yish. 969 is for tamp yish. i kno even 67 so bad manage
              at tamp. most time morn get rigid when bus pack to door. </p>

              <p>Totally not sure who's the one using harsh words now...</p>
              <p>But yeah, Even 168 has its share of delays. Why not you try waiting for it at Tampines MRT? It comes off schedule more often than 969. </p>
              <p>Okay sure, 969 may lose out in terms of HC buses. But at least it's showing signs of improvement! There are less rigids now than before. </p>
              <p>And how you know 965 dont get 5-8 min? Ok maybe to clarify, it's during peak la. But 85 is far far from this! So is 117.</p>

              <p>Infact, your sentence isn't true. (Nature of Bus Enthus....love SMRT than SBST) There seems to be more SBST lovers than SMRT(not here).</p>
              <p>You can have people saying SMRT sucks just because their train breakdown regularly. You can always say SBST sucks just because they bought a lot of KUBs or Citaros. </p>
              <p>Still, at the end of the day, you rely on them. That's why I don't really see the need of having a post of "SBST vs SMRT" and/or comparing the BSEP svces and called "no brainer". Like if you have the brain, why keep quiet? </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB42P, so do you all realise by now that people are the main source of issues? You cannot satisfy everybody. You withdraw a bus service, people complain. You cut short a bus service, people complain. You amend a bus service, people complain. You give a new bus service, those who do not directly benefit complain. You give SDs, people complain. You give DDs, people also complain. You give people bus services to their bus stops, others want certain services to skip so as to be faster. You give people direct routes, they want express services. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
