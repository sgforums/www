              <p>if I remember correctly, it is a fleet add for sv87 as some peak hour trips are being added. Not ruling out possibility of conversion of BSEP Citaro slot to full day. But most likely is fleet add. </p>

              <p>Should be fleet add for Sv 87 though in my opinion. It used to be 3356E followed by 9462S directly with no buses in between during AM Peak towards Sengkang, but nowadays since 2 weeks ago, as what I've posted earlier, 3464B somehow appears in between 3356E &amp; 9462S..</p>

It is also e-pull many times from other services looking at the long queues. Most times this bus is done by bendies, last week 1 day there were 4 DDs running on 983 (no bendy).</p>

              <p>On sv 300, I kind of agree with you because if you see sv 300 main loading comes from Ave 4 now. Those on ave 2 will not be in their right mind if they take sv 300 to MRT when they have a cheaper and faster option with 301. Those on ave 3 do have an option of taking 975/975A. </p>
              <p>So basically makes more sense to beef up capacity on 983 because the HDB complex on ave 5 is huge and the one stop there gives 983 around 40-50 pax in AM. Then on ave 4, loading is shared between 983/300 depending on which one arrives first, but there is place for both.</p>
              <p>On another note, after 300 route was truncated, it did lose 4 buses including its BSEP slot. I further see 983 getting more DDs, and 300 losing more bendies.</p>

              <p>I boarded SMB1516H today..it was on 302AP06 (driven by the same pair of BC who drove 1175E last time, so i presume it was on 302AP06 this whole week), and i suspect 1510Z was on 302AP05... yesterday SMB8019E was on 302AP03...i couldnt see the description though on both occasions...</p>
              <p>If this is the case, it means that 302 got a fleet downgrade for AP duties, but i do see a good number of bendies, is there more split shift slot now?</p>

              <p>Personally, I wouldn't trust sgwiki over their deployments provided, particularly for SMRT buses, as they are mostly <strong>verified through continuous spottings gathered by bus enthusiasts rather than official evidence provided by the operator itself, </strong>since SMRT do not paste perm stix on their buses. Even SBST is not pasting perm stix on many of their buses nowadays.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the deployments for SMRT buses continuously change on a daily basis at a much faster rate than SBST buses, which is a weird phenomenon to me. I would prefer to think that SMRT do not employ fixed perms/fleet size for many of their services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Even 302A from Yew Tee to crescent... just a few stops... gets a full packed bus... </p>
              <p>Yew Tee definitely should get new service to BPJ once DTL2 starts. It will be a disgrace if people have to use 302 to head to CCK and then change to LRT and then to DTL2.</p>
              <p>Imagine living at Crescent and wanting to go to Bukit Timah, you would have to do:</p>
              <p>302 --&gt; NSL at Yew Tee to CCK --&gt; LRT at CCK to BPJ --&gt; DTL2 to Bukit Timah</p>
