              <p>buses and trains are different</p>
              <p>if i had to stand, i would prefer to stand inside the train car instead of standing inside the bus.if there are seats on the bus, go for it, beats standing in train anytime. a seat on any trains is like hitting a jackpot.</p>

              <p>Sv169, 187 should get more SDs instead. Frequency jialat max. </p>
              <p>Sv859 need some fleet add also. Sv961 BAT also got issue alr...forget about this haha</p>

              <p>I don't understand what is the issue with standing. People have been standing on buses in Singapore for a very long time, and then suddenly bus companies have to provide for pampered, lazy, self entitled people?</p>
              <p>If people in the past can board and stand right at the front next to the radiator on an Olympian, or right next to the engine on a front engined bus, both of which are non-airconditioned, why can't people nowadays stand in the aisle of a low floor bus? Its not like there has been a massive and simultaneous genetic mutation that renders humans incapable of standing.</p>
              <p>So suddenly, people are complaining that a certain bus company is buying too many SDs, when the real issue is people refusing to stand. And who is going to pay for any upsizing of buses? Nobody, because people complain about fare hikes. Don't expect LTA to stop buying SDs, because under the GCM, they will be the one bearing the costs, and I would expect them to cut down on unnecessary usage or overcapacity using whatever data they may obtain.</p>
