              <p>Sv 20 is popular because it is not as troublesome as taking MRT from Expo (The frequency is as long as 15mins) then change trains at Tanah Merah to Simei.</p>
              <p>However it's off peak esp aft 9pm the bus can be as empty as a shell</p>

              <p>Depends highly on the timings and direction which the DDs on Sv 169 are deployed though IMO. The 3x BSEP ones so far (3536L, 3537J, 3538G) are deployed right smack in the timings where the loadings have increased lately in direction of Woodlands from AMK during AM Peak. So I suppose that's a good choice.</p>
              <p>I've yet to see 5027B on Sv 169 for AM Peak yet on Weekdays though, so I shall not comment on that first. But maybe IMO, SMRT should consider swapping around some of the MANs' timings with the Bendies in the other direction to AMK during AM Peak.  </p>

              <p>Many mention how HK succeed with DDs only. While I do not deny that the PTO needs to play a part in this (planning and resource management), I believe the mindset of the people play a part too. Since we are not some big boss, we can't exactly force people to change (unless someone finds a way, which I encourage the act.)</p>
              <p>TL:DR, people's action will affect overall service level, and LTA/PTO normally gets the blunt in the end. It takes two to clap and we can't do shit if one isn't willing to, and is the one judging you.</p>

              <p>Yes and I observe so many times, Citaro has so much space at rare.. people who board stand in center near PIW space. Many times bus leaves interchange only with 50 pax when capacity is 70 pax. and there the queue remains big. </p>
              <p>Same goes for bendy. Many times observe even at CCK Int when I checked last. sv 300 bendy has space in second car, but already people blocked the way. Bendy left with only 80 pax leaving a big queue still behind. </p>
              <p>For DD, for short routes many people might not go up (especially in SMRT territory) coz SBST territoty you do see full upper deck for 222, 241, 243, 291, 334 etc. Again, bus cannot leave without its max capacity.</p>
              <p>There needs to be more education around this and people need to be more sensitive about these things.</p>

              <p>I agree with carbusbike. SBS stubborn and dont wanna use bendy bus. so double deck is to show people they already do something (all SD people sure blindy complain),  might not necessarily be the best thing. 3-4 stops people go up go down is really increase dwell times by alot. </p>
              <p>As for 300, 804, 912 - the loading on these services cannot compare with 243 (225 and 291 i dunno the situation).

              <p>Yes it failed... and there are legitimate reasons why LTA also does not favor bendies... If you even consider Bedok Interchange or Tampines Interchange... imagine if services such as 291, 293 had bendy fleet... with that many services calling at the interchange and stops... feasible? ofcourse not. </p>
