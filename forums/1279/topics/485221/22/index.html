              <p>During peak hours, the entire route of 268 has massive loading.
              268 deserves dds but i think AMDEP has a mental block with giving
              dds to feeders/intra-towns (only recent exception 410W). Lemon

              <p>268P was not needed at all. Rather 268 full route needed more

              <p>If it was BNDEP, you would have seen 261, 268, 269 all have DDs.

              <p>TPY also got similar issue. Lor 4 have 7 svcs from TPY Int heading to north exit. Lor 1 and 6 only got feeders and 1 passing trunk. Divert 1 or 2 go via Lor 1 and 6 la. Just because it is the fastest way out, does not means one have to spam that road with services, unless they are heading to somewhere specific like an industrial estate</p>

              <p>but I think LTA does work with the operators to agree and decide on services as finally operations/interchange/depot management is with the PTOs. </p>
              <p>Now just see 261 getting 8 buses with 3 crossovers. That's a little crazy. Just DDs on A/P shift would have helped relieve the load. Just like 225G is doing very well at Bedok. Same for 268.</p>

              <p>Bro, IMO 225G should be fleet of 5 buses with 4 DDs, 1 SD.</p>
              <p>Currently service has 6 buses after BSEP DD add.</p>
              <p>From what I have observed during AM peak, 225G DDs easily get 80-90 pax in AM peak. Same observation in PM, when DD comes, easily takes 80-90 pax, when KUB comes.. bus packed with 70 pax with 10-15 pax in queue.</p>
              <p>That's why 225G got BSEP DD and not SD because of the heavy load. </p>
              <p>225W on the other hand<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> does not</span> need DDs at all. most buses get 45-50 pax... sometimes touching 70 pax... Easily the DD can be transferred to 225G and its KUB can be given to 225W. </p>

              <p>I absolutely agree and this was a suggestion I had given long back. All trunks ply Lor 4... I don't see why 73 or 159 cannot ply Lor 6 instead giving direct connection. 28/73/155/159 all ply same route right upto Bradell Bus Park. Easily one of them could do Lor 6. </p>

              <p>I do agree with your point that you wont see 225 DDs with fully seated upper decks, but during peak hours a good 25-30 pax go upstairs. This allows another 70 pax to fit in lower deck, bringing the capacity of the bus to 95-100 pax. It helps to move the queue faster at Bedok Interchange as well as helps during AM peak clear crowds at bus stop along north ave 2. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Alternative is to have bendies, but since SBST has none, DDs</span> on 225 have been immensely useful even if upper deck is not full. </p>

              <p>That's bad planning... its like deploying 11 buses on 269 and 11 on 261 w/ crossover for small route... you know that many more BCs, interchange space, fuel consumption for few leftover pax that can be cleared by DDs... anyway, I think Bedok North residents will be quite happy as with opening of new interchange, saw longer queues on 225G and this fleet add will only help. </p>

              <p>That's bad planning... its like deploying 11 buses on 269 and 11
              on 261 w/ crossover for small route... you know that many more BCs,
              interchange space, fuel consumption for few leftover pax that can
              be cleared by DDs... anyway, I think Bedok North residents will be
              quite happy as with opening of new interchange, saw longer queues
              on 225G and this fleet add will only help. </p>

              <p>72B for an even shorter route has 3-4 DDs almost daily.. It is same logic and reason as 225G... Even if short route, there are some who go to upper deck, creating more space on lower deck and able yo clear more queue during peak hours. That's y even after storming 72B with 12-13 SDs, SBST/BSEP decided to upgrade some slots with dd. </p>

              <p>Yes... HGDEP can control all 9 buses... I don't think service will loop... Noticed bet Lor 1 and Farrer...
