              <p>Not surprising. Not one bit. SMRT very actively yet silently
                  reduces capacity on routes like 851, 854 and 969 while boasting
                  about an addition of a mere 1 double-deck bus on 856. Yes, ever
                  since 969 went full WLDEP, the number of DDs have not increased
                  while the number of bendies have decreased. I can clearly see that
                  some of the AMDEP bendies have been replaced by A22s. Also, what
                  happened to AMDEP crossovers to 969?</p>

              <p>actually while SMRT upgraded 1 DD (or maybe is LTA BSEP not even SMRT), SMRT in turn removed 1 851 bendy xover to 856... only they wont say</p>

              <p>From what I see...</p>
              <p>Sv184 gets 1/2 bunch up in the day(noon). However, when it comes to night(8+), the SDs are usually placed back to back, with SLIGHTLY shorter intervals than bendy. The min. SDs is usually 3, sometimes it's more than 3(at night). They should make the intervals for SDs shorter. </p>
              <p>Sv969 gets downgrade after AMDEP? Don't seems so...? Those ex-811 bendy are covering the slots for the ex-AM ones. DD spotted almost everytime on the route, even on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Sv854 indeed major downgrade after this round, not even 857 gets more DD to somewhat "cover" the part from YCK rd(at least).  </p>
              <p>By right, I tot by returning the slots for sv811 back to AMDEP will means more A24s deployed on there, but sadly no. </p>
              <p>Sv911 still have at least 1-2 bendy running on weekends. It's usually 1 on TQ slots, another on AP. The no. may increase to 3 but usually, there would be at least 1(on TQ). Although it's seems reasonable in the day, evening period(5:20+) and PM off-peak(9+) frequency can be rubbish. </p>
              <p>But AM peak surely got downgrades somehow? 2 969 crossover(1041H/1071X) is now taken by MAN, not sure about the 2 911E/963 related slots, but there's a new 911Ex169 AM slot done by bendy. </p>

              <p>Yes SMRT has been playing this trick for last one year. Look at sv 856. Was full bendy fleet. 1 slot got downgraded to SD, then 2... today fleet has 6 SDs from SMRT side... while the DDs have been added from BSEP pool.</p>
              <p>Same goes for 187. Reduced 1 bendy slot... BSEP DD added. 172 frequently there are only 2 bendies perm.. sometimes have 3 or 4... now putting DDs</p>
              <p>180 fleet has 11 buses for so long... when definitely needs more</p>

              <p>Recently, haven't noticed 857A to have DDs (but again I don't observe this area everyday, just know that 857A has rigids as perms and not DDs)... 1-2 months back you consistently had 1 or 2 DDs plying on 857 and the deployment was messy because it would follow a 857 rigid in 3-4 mins - so really didn't make sense.</p>
