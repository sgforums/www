              <p>But i've taken the Wrights on Sv 39 quite a few times during AM

              might have something to do with the H1 schedule &amp; June sch

              <p>Off peak I don't care... most buses are empty of half full... but peak is important... and if you are saying both upper and lower deck seats are taken + few standees... can already assume bus gets 80+ pax which is way more than what a KUB can stuff at 70 pax. So that's good.</p>

              <p>Another point to add on is that, I observed too that on average
              the Wright indeed spends less time at each stop compared to the
              KUBs/Citaros to load the same amount of pax. Abit like "duh~" I
              know. But it does help the Sv 39 BCs to keep to their frequency
              better.<br> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I've not seen any bunching during
              AM Peak yet so far, which is a good sign, especially when it's
              kinda common to see 2x KUBs bunching tgt last
              time. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I do wish they do
              something to their Off-Peak frequency though. Not sure if it's
              related to the H1 schedule, but during Off Peak (especially mid-day
              &amp; early afternoon), it's kinda normal to wait for 20-25mins
              nowadays for a Sv 39, even though the E-timetable says
              otherwise..</span></p>

              <p>I have ever been saying this.</p>
              <p>During peak hours DD is faster than SD on crowded services. I noticed this so many times that SD crawls at each bus stop once it reaches 65 pax. People have to alight, then those near front door have to move back for new people to board. Hence, most SD services are highly notorious for bunching. </p>

              <p>I think it also depends on which direction you take them though. I usually take them to go in the direction of Yishun from PSR at like 7am+. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              8227L 8328D) around on Sv 39, it's already a sign that whichever
              they kicked out the first time (8301E 8563R that bunch) was just
              the first round. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>not sure why u keep saying that there will be more DD for sv39 after school holiday?</p>
              <p>if u have notice, there are 101 trips from tampines to yishun for sv39 during school holidays while there are only 96 trips from tampines to yishun for sv39 during normal days.... if there is less demand during school holiday, then why there are way more trips of sv39 during school holidays?</p>

              But in terms of frequensy, I would transfer to 965 from 86 if I stay near Rivervale Drive.
              Well, Sengkang West people have no choice but to take 85 instead. So I would say that 85 is direct for Sengkang West people but not really for the Punggol East/Sengkang East people.
              In my opinion, transfering to 39/858/965/969 would be a quicker option for those staying near Punggol East &amp; Sengkang East. Cheers.

              <p>It is only because the MP went forcing that DDs are going to be deployed. Otherwise really didn't need. The moment you have a direct service launched passing by Compass point to Sengkang West, sv 85 will run empty buses. </p>

              <p>I said more DDs yes, but I think you kinda misinterpreted my post. I didn't mean more DDs as in fleet adds? <br>I mean more DDs in the sense that they will likely cut 1-2 SD slots, and also replace 2-3 other SDs with DDs. So Sv 39 gain more DDs (in terms of qty of DDs), but overall fleet size (SD + DDs) shrinks. Hope this clarifies?<br><br>And yeah, I did post about the reduction in no. of trips for the new Weekday schedule long time ago before the DDs even appeared (but I think you didn't see it, so it's okay).</p>
              <p>So IMO likely the new Weekday schedule (after Sch Hols) involves converting a few more full-day slots into S-shifts. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">This would account for the no. of trips being reduced while maintaining roughly the same capacity.</span></p>
              <p>Just my guess though. I might be wrong, but sooner or later they'll convert more SDs to DDs in the future. Maybe not directly after June Hols end, but it'll happen at some point.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, smrt 965 frequency is nether good. Depends on which part of rivervale drive as sbs 85 also goes to rivervale drive.</p>
              <p>For those staying in Punggol east and sengkang east, sbs 85 is equally fast. Transferring will be slower as 858, 965, 969 are usually crowded and you still need another bus service to get to TPE and walk across the super long dreaded bridge. By then, sbs 85 will have been on its way. Anyway sbs 85 has limited stops at sengkang east and Punggol east. In less than 8 min, it will have covered Punggol east (from Riveria LRT) and sengkang east (up to sengkang east road). Cheers.</p>
