They were registered as private buses when they were deployed on Jurong Island services. The buses has since been re-registered back to their previous SBS registrations and some of them have been repainted to SBS Transit livery.<br><br>There are two types of buses deployed on Turf City shuttles. The stepless, one-door buses were once Airbus buses. Airbus were premium shuttle services operating between Changi Airport and major hotels. They are of the Scania L113CRL models. Another type are the ex-Sentosa B10M buses.<br><br>A number of the Sentosa B10Ms have been re-registered to SBS registrations and now deployed on Service 78.</div>

After that it went into hibernation sometime in the late 90's before re-surfacing again sporting new liveries and replaced the aging L113CRL's on Turf City services.<br><br>as other forumnites mentioned, 502 are the very same Mercedes O405 buses that SBST uses.</div>

They are:-<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Mercedes Benz O405 - Was originally SBS buses with SBS registrations. 20 or so units were transferred to SBS Leisure when SBSL won the contract to operate 3 Jurong Island Services. The selected buses were repainted into the SBS Leisure livery and re-registered to "PA" registrations. When the JIS contract expires, these O405s were transferred back to SBS Transit and re-registered back to their original SBS registrations. Some of these O405s have been repainted into the SBS Transit livery while the rest still sport the SBS Leisure livery. The O405s never operated on any other scheduled shuttles like the Turf City shuttles. These O405s is usually seen serving Express 502 and other services controlled by SLBP.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Scania L113CRL - Was originally premium Airbus buses which operates between Changi Airport and major hotels. Had an Electronic Destination System display in front with a rectangular plastic desto on its nearside. When the Airbus services were withdrawn, the buses were repainted into the SBS Leisure livery and the EDS dismantled. The buses were then deployed on Turf City shuttles and currently under ComfortBus operations.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Volvo B10M Mark 4 - Was originally Sentosa buses, operating between Sentosa and Tiong Bahru MRT, former World Trade Centre Bus Terminal and Orchard Road. When the Sentosa services were withdrawn, the buses were taken out of any service indefinitely and was parked at Soon Lee Bus Park in Boon Lay for quite some time. Recently, a number of these buses were re-registered to SBS registrations and repainted into SBS Transit livery. The majority were deployed on Service 78 with a couple of them now served as Training Buses. The rest of the ex-Sentosa B10Ms received new "PA" registrations and repainted into SBS Leisure livery and operates on Turf City shuttles.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*Appreciate if anyone could correct if there are any mistakes. Thanks.<br>The information given above was purely out of my knowledge on the buses.</span></div>
