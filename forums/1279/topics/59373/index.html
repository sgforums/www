            <div class='col-md body'>Last evening, as usual i took bus 963 after work to go home. When the bus reached bukit batok, it started to go very very slowly (abt 5km/h) and there wasn't any traffic jam.<br><br>Everyone was puzzled. Then the bus driver told us not to press the stop button as it will make the bus go very slowly. He will stop at every bus stop.. Everyone including me find it ridiculous but it turn out to be true..<br><br>Not long after that, someone pressed the stop button and the bus suddenly go very slow again.. so the driver have to open the back door of the bus in order for the "bus stopping" light to goes off..  then immediately after that, the bus could resume at normal speed..<br><br>Strange right? Can anyone explain this or does anyone experience such thing be4 also?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I am not wrong, there was this story about a bus which would have a ghostly presence at a set time (I think it would always be the 1st bus). Some body (or some thing) would get on the bus at the interchange, and travel to some bus stop, where it will alight. Nobody could see it, but they could feel its presence. Bus drivers who failed to stop were severely harrassed or beaten up by this "invisible" person.<br><br>Scary. Heard it from True Singapore's Ghost Stories...</div>
