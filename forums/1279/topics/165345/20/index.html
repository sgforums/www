Not sure whether I asked this before, but it seems like some Volvo B10M MK IV DM3500 buses are quite different from each other, and I'm not talking about SBS 2754X or SBS 2779A. Some have a more "electric" or "futuristic" engine sound than others, while a few exhibit "kneeling" features, something more usually found on low-floor buses. Still others emit a "hiss hiss hiss hiss" sound somewhere from the front axle. What's going on?<br><br></div></blockquote>I dunno about futuristic sounds, but certainly I've seen DM3500s going around like they are on stilts. Still, I'm not sure if this indicates that the kneeling still exists.<br><br>Among the DM3500s, 2756R roars like the other MKIVs, and 2697C always have a very long-lag from start, probably torque-mismatch.</div>

Not enough buses in one depot?<br><br>And secondly, let's say the driver reports to BB, then he finds out the bus he is going to drive is going to be deployed from AR, does he have to travel to AR himself? Will there be enough time? And does he return the bus at the end of he day to AR?</div></blockquote>could it be, in arbp's case, the bus went to bbdep for maintenance, then the next day will start from bbdep which the driver will noe?<br></div>

At Clementi, 14, 96 from AR, but 99,165, 166 from BB etc<br><br>for AMK and Braddell, the sharing of buses are less frequent.. Braddell buses usually on Toa Payoh, Eunos and sv131... AMK is St Michael's, Shenton Way, AMK, YCK</div>
