On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Super_Olympian" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia's article on the Volvo Super Olympian</a>, it was noted that several nicknames have been slapped on it (possibly in Hong Kong). The article reads (Chinese characters omitted as they don't display properly here):<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted on Wikipedia:</div><div class="quote_body">The engine was Volvo D10A285, with the maximum power of only 285hp, lower than 305hp of Cummins M11-305E used on Neoplan Centroliner and Dennis Trident 3, and 335hp of Cummins ISMe Euro III used on Dennis Trident 3/Enviro 500.<br><br>There are several nicknames of this bus model, which mean that the bus is not powerful enough. The most common are (pig), (meat cutlet) and (pork chop), derived from the word "Super").</div></blockquote>I think this might be the reason that they were taken off those expressway routes: not enough horsepower, which translates into slower speeds and acceleration.<br><br>p.s. I personally felt that they should have put a few Dennis Trident buses on this route if they wanted to retain low floor buses on those routes. In fact, I dreamed about a Trident on route 161 inside Woodlands Interchange once  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, this is a rather interesting question. It's actually not about the buses, but rather about the kind of passengers on certain routes, namely routes 16 and 195. I noticed that these routes seems to see Japanese people regularly (for a non-airport route, that is). I once took route 195 from Depot Road to Tiong Bahru station, and there were two Japanese boys, around the age of teenagers, on board. And this evening, I was at the Orchard Road area Youth Park bus stop when I saw two Japanese girls, who later caught a route 16 bus going in the direction of Bukit Merah. It seems like there's some place along these two routes that the Japanese in Singapore are clustered together, but it doesn't seem to be the Japanese Association (as far as I know, they actually charter SMRT's BusPlus buses for their shuttle - I spotted them on two ocassions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  (p.s. maybe they should have used the Nissans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )). In fact, SBS Transit has a lot of buses with the Asashi Beer advertisement on these two routes, seemingly targeted at the Japanese. Just what is this place? Bukit Merah? The area around Great World City?</div>
