            <div class='col-md body'>A barrage of questions to keep this thread busy...<br><br>1. I remember that, in the mid-1990s (somewhere around 1994 to 1996, if I remember correctly), I saw several SBS Transit (then SBS) buses running around at rather "ulu" (usually industrial areas) at night. What is weird about them is that, instead of the usual red number plates (with two terminating/looping points beside the number for non-aircon routes and a number with the words "AIR CON" beside it for air-conditioned ones, as with the norm at that time), they used green ones. Furthermore, they had route numbers whose routes did not ply where I saw them. Also, the side destination plates had numbers that did not match the shown number in front. I saw them only at night, and they never had any lights on, save for their headlights and the front destination plate's backlight. I remember seeing some people who did not seem like SBS staff (if I'm not wrong, one of them was an old lady) alighting from one such bus once. What were they? Were they employee buses, or something else?<br><br>2. There is one old TIBS Hino HT2XX series bus which was given to some school for some purpose other than being a bus (similar to the epBus and Boobie the GymBus). I saw a photo of it once, but I have since lost it's URL. Which bus was it, what is it for now, does it still exists, and does anyone have a picture of it?<br><br>3. Not sure whether I asked this before, but it seems like some Volvo B10M MK IV DM3500 buses are quite different from each other, and I'm not talking about SBS 2754X or SBS 2779A. Some have a more "electric" or "futuristic" engine sound than others, while a few exhibit "kneeling" features, something more usually found on low-floor buses. Still others emit a "hiss hiss hiss hiss" sound somewhere from the front axle. What's going on?<br><br>4. Whatever happened to SBS 30P (the Renault bus)? By my calculations, it should have at least survived into the early 21st century...<br><br>5. Similarly, is the one and only MAN bus in SBS Transit's fleet (SBS 81S) still around? Are there any photographs of it with the SBS Transit livery?<br><br>6. I heard a rumour around here that TIBS bought some Hino HT2XX buses with Hispano bodies (same as the ones most of the Mercedes MB O405 buses and the older DAF SB220 buses (now scrapped) carry). Is it true?<br><br>And finally...<br><br>7. The fate of all but three former SBS Leisure Scania L113CRL buses remain quite a mystery. They were only known to have been "deregistered", but what exactly happened to them? Sold to somewhere else? Scarpped? Cannibalised for spare parts?<br><br>Edit: I suddenly remembered a eighth question. Apologies for the number of questions I'm asking...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>8. Why is it that route 858 stops going to Changi Airport after 11:00PM? Does it have to do with getting the buses back to the depot?</div>

Is it scheduled in such a way that there will be no more buses going to Changi Airport from Orchard Road after 11:00PM or thereabouts?
