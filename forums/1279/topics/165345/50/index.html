With the history of some of our buses stretching as far back as 19 years now, I sometimes really wonder: has any bus ever permed on a particular route, went off it, and then went back to perm on it again after many years? Has a non air-conditioned bus did this after it was converted to an air-conditioned bus? How about reused numbers (for example, a perm on the old route 3 is now a perm on the new route 3, etc.)?</div>

They can hit 85km/h.. </div></blockquote>I was in a Volgren Bendy (TIB 1179U) once, and at one point, it was travelling as fast as an SUV that was travelling beside it. I estimated that it hit at least 90 km/h at one point.<br><br>Happened on route 857. I related my experience around here before.<br><br>Another question:<br><br>As that saying goes, life can intimate art sometimes. So I wonder: was SBS 9814K ever a perm bus on route 88?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
