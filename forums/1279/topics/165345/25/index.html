Before that, it was Hougang INt (Hougang South Interchange). When hougang Central Interchange opened in the year 1994, Upp Serangoon Rd Terminal was closed down and all services were diverted into Hougang Central Interchange.<br><br>During the construction of the NorthEast Line in the year 1997, Hougang Central Interchange was then being affected. A temporary interchange was built beside the Hougang Plaza. At the same time, the original Hougang Central Interchange then became Hougang Central Terminal as the Temp Int couldnt fit in so many services. After the completion of the NEL, Hougang Central Terminal and Hougang Central Interchange then reunited and they remain on the current site ever since.</div>
