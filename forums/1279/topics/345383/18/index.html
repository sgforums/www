              <p>I feel that bendys should be used for high demand feeders and some trunks. But please keep them off busy roads like orchard rd. Yes, i agree that they can unload all pax faster but majority of bus stops dont really have much alighting activity. 2 DDs will take around the same time as 1 bendy.</p>

              <p>Let's say using 2 bendies (2x 18m = 36m) and 3 DDs (3x 12m = 36m), if we time each set individually offloading the same number of pax each (say 80 for each DD and 120 for each bendy), bendies take much faster to unload that 150% more pax and can close doors faster than DDs which still require some pax to exit the flight of stairs. Note that each type of buses are offloading 240 pax in this case, and both types of buses have been added to reach 36m. And we are assuming in this case that everyone is alighting.</p>
              <p>Basically 80 pax leaving from that 2 exits (assuming you can use entrance doors) while 120 pax leaving from 3 exits. Though it may seem like bendies offloading more pax but eventually both types of buses are offloading average 40 pax each from the individual doors. However bendies don't need pax to climb down stairs so they can directly get up from their seats and head for the exit doors while in a DD, a noticeable fraction of pax still need to go down the stairs.</p>
              <p>So eventually what you get is that bendies shut their doors faster and move off, while DDs are still struggling with that last bit of pax.</p>
              <p>So this is not about how long the buses are, even though yes it may seem to hinder other vehicles, but how fast they can let passengers off, because how long they stay in the bus bay depends on how fast they let passengers off. Assuming the above situation continues on, meaning at regular intervals 2 bendies and 3 DDs arrive again, we find that this bus-blocking problem exists in both cases, and not just bendies.</p>

              <p>I full agree on this point, but however, what if the local bus body makers who designed an ''imaginary DD'' which had 3 doors (2 rear doors and 1 entrance) and 2 stairways leading to the upper deck? Would it make the rate of unloading a DD to be twice as faster?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>LTA build longer bus bays sure got reasons.One is the loads another for bendy and more buses can park.Agree that bendy use a bit of space more than DD but think again SG roads is already congested and got full day bus lane so what's the big issue here?SMRT buses is likely to move off faster than SBST at bus stops due to the duty timings.I see more DDs shaking to certain destination rather than bendy slow.</div>

              <p>Germans are doing it, the MAN Lion City DD have 3 doors.</p>
              <p>Also note the increasing trend and popularity of DDs, many cities in the world can't live with bendies simply because they have been causing congestion.</p>
