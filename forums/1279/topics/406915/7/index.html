              <p>some people have these tendencies. unfortunately to these people
              the whole hobby of "photography" has become an ego issue, where the
              whole objective is to go one up over other people by having the
              purportedly better photo.</p>

              <p>So are u trying to say that those ppl who have the pictures with the EDS showing Soon Lee Rd have intentions? Maybe, u should interview others which the press does to get the facts? Willis Chong, Clement Tan Ke Wei, Ng Wei Tong and me, all these ppl, feel free to interview them. </p>
              <p>I saw the EDS showing Soon Lee Rd. And, may I ask u? Why do all these ppl edit their photos? To enhance it? To fake it? I dun think so. I think ur the one who did not get the facts right. No offense, I'm just tellin' u.</p>
              <p>Up to date, I only know, photographers like me only edit photos to ENHANCE it. Not to FAKE it.</p>

              <p>what intention does simple_boi, SBS233X, busmanic and ngjy22
              have to edit a mere EDS from Pioneer Rd North to Soon Lee Rd?</p>
              <p>why did your good friend sBs_boy as i qoute from his post

              <p>Can you or sBs_boy please explain &gt; "Too bad that something
              has been done to the EDS..."?</p>
              <p>So the both of you saying that everyone who captured the
              shot with Soon Lee Road as the EDS "Zhng it with an old photo from
              a scania" ; including the nightshots?</p>
              <p>losing your credibility is bad enough, trying to escape the

              <p>should i also imply that because he want to make himself unique
              or stand out by making such a ruckus is because he is unable to
              capture a SOON LEE RD destination for the EDS, thus making him,

              <p>well one would expect the flames to settle down after apologising, but look at what happened after sbs_boy apologised. instead of letting it lie low, like everyone else, somebody has decided to take it personal, and worse still, someone completely out of the picture decides to come in and add fuel to the fire.</p>
              <p>i'm sure everyone has a right to their own defence especially when some people refuse to let things slide. i don't think there were any inflammatory intentions in his rebuttal.</p>
