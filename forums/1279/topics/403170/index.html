              <p>Okay i see.. So from the point of view, it seems that BC pay is higher than TO? What about the benefits? Is it when you ride on SBST Buses or Trains will be foc if I am a BC; free ride for SMRT Buses and Trains if I am TO? Only this benefits? The benefits apply to the family as well or only 1 person?</p>

              <p>i think because people would apply this job since their education level is lower than us. and why very stressed? because driving a real-life train is really troublesome. remember that there is alot of recent cases of people commiting suicide by jumping down on tracks? not forgetting that they have to work long hours going up and down those lines but low pay.</p>

              <p><br>Train drivers need to know electric basics including circuit breakers which are common on trains and learn signalling (which involve electric basics as well) among many other stuff... A Nitec certification would come in handy, they are like engineers on the tracks, the first line of 'defense' against common train problems.</p>
              <p>As a small comparison, JR East promotes its Train Driver (é�‹è»¢å£«) salary as 167900 JPY (2560 SGD) for graduates of the same level as required here (with a maximum of 180600 JPY/2750 SGD), with provision for city allowance (more allowance if you are staying in/near Tokyo than away, up to 15 percent of your basic salary). Transportation on company lines free, 30 percent discount on company hospital bills, accomodation subsidy etc.</p>
              <p>However for them, it takes many years to become a train driver, most importantly you get a national license (just like your car license) to drive a train. 2 to 3 years as staff in stations, then another similar period as a train conductor (safety recognition and announcement duties) before you take a year or so of courses, go through a national exam, drive as a trainee driver and then on to become a full-fledged train driver and obtain a certified national license. Overall it takes about 10 years to finish the training.</p>
              <p>Thats what makes a real difference between a train driver there and an operator here.</p>
              <p>Bus drivers wise the pay is about the same of 2000 to 2500 SGD converted.</p>

              <p>Okay i see.. So from the point of view, it seems that BC pay is
              higher than TO? What about the benefits? Is it when you ride on
              SBST Buses or Trains will be foc if I am a BC; free ride for SMRT
              Buses and Trains if I am TO? Only this benefits? The benefits apply
              to the family as well or only 1 person?</p>

              <p>If you are just out for the pay, and you have a better education cert (poly, A-lvl, degree), you should consider the higher positions in the companies.</p>
              <p>The benefits are individual (only yourself). IIRC it used to be extended to family members many years back, but they tend to end up getting abused.</p>
