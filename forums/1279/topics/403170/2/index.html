              <p>I tought recently SBST launch a new salary for Local Singaporean who join as aBC is $1300 for starting pay? Anyone can clarify on this? Is that truth?</p>

              <p>Yes, SBST has revised the BC's Pay to attract Singaporean. This is under the Press Release dated 18th Jan 2010 of SBST.</p>
              <p><span class="subheader"><strong>SBS Transit Revises Bus Captains' Pay to Attract More Singaporeans into the Profession</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 5px;"> </p>
              <p>With effect from the beginning of this year, Singaporeans who join SBS Transit as Bus Captains will earn about 15% more every month.</p>
              <p>On top of the new monthly basic salary of $1,375, Singaporean Bus Captains will continue to get allowances which means that new Singaporean Bus Captains can earn over $1,900 every month in their first year of employment.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit Executive Director, Mr Gan Juay Kiat, said: “Over the years, we’ve seen fewer and fewer Singaporeans join us as Bus Captains. We hope to raise the attractive factor of this profession by revising the starting pay for Singaporeans upwards. This is one more additional approach taken including stepping up our training programmes for Bus Captains to develop and strengthen their skills.”</p>
              <p>Singaporean Bus Captains whose basic salary is currently less than $1,375 can opt for the new pay structure or stay on their existing scheme which has a higher variable component.</p>
              <p>The company will also be extending a one-off ex-gratia payment to all Bus Captains who are not affected by the pay adjustment exercise. The ex-gratia payment of between $50 and $200 will be paid out this month depending on the number of years of service.</p>
              <p>NTUC Assistant Secretary-General and NTWU Acting Executive Secretary Mr Ong Ye Kung said: “I am hugely satisfied and relieved that Management and Union have reached a consensus to raise the entry salary for Bus Captains. A basic salary of $1,375 better reflects the scope of responsibilities of a Bus Captain, and the prevailing situation in the Singapore labour market today. It is also a clear signal from SBS Transit that driving buses safely and efficiently is a core capability of the company, and it intends to attract good Singaporean workers to do the job. NTWU will give our full support to SBS Transit to make sure that higher pay incentivises higher productivity, and higher productivity drives higher pay. This way, company and workers all benefit.”</p>
              <p>SBS Transit currently has close to 5,500 Bus Captains, of which about 38% are Singaporeans.</p>
