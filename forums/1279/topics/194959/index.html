            <div class='col-md body'>I had two unpleasant encounters with SBS Transit over the past few months I would like to highlight. I noticed that lately SBS Transit Bus Captains tend to drive very slowly e.g. around 30KPH to 35KPH when the road is all clear. It can really be very irritating and frustrating for those who are in a hurry to work or appointments. I understand that Bus Captains will be penalized if they arrive too early. But by driving slowly they are indirectly penalizing us commuters who turn to public transport as it is cheap. Bus Captains also tend to purposely slow down at traffic Junctions when the traffic light is green in hope of it changing to red so that they can delay time. Also the frequencies of SBS Transit buses are extremely long and on some services very short. I wonder why there is this imbalance not counting short loop services like service 200.<br><br>On the other had I am very surprised with the standard of service SMRT provides. The Bus Captains drives at reasonable speeds such as 50-55KPH which also does not put passengers at risk of accidents. In fact driving slowly does not mean that it is safe as the bus might be hogging the road and cause vehicles behind the bus to overtake and in the case when the driver is unable to see what is coming in the other direction on a two way road, accidents might occur. The frequency of SMRT buses are very reasonable at 5-7minutes during peak hours and 10-12 minutes during off peak hours from what I have observed. Compared to 10-12 minutes during off-peak hours for SBS Transit buses and 14-18 minutes for SBS Transit buses.<br><br>*The figures and timing above are estimated and may vary from service to service.<br></div>

SBST drivers don't really road-hog nowadays. Not only that, frequency-wise...<br><br>334 can have 3 min frequency during peak hour. Not visible on svcs like 190. 190 is a very good service, but SMRT doesn't seem to be improving its frequency. Did you notice the never-ending queues? Not only that, it is understandable you feel this way. Perhaps it is the place where you live that could be the reason, where SMRT is predominant. But I assure you SBST frequencies are better.
