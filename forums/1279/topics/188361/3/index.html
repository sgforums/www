            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think although this is an open forum for all to discuss about things related to Singapore buses, the <span style="font-style: italic;">least</span> we should do is to post responsibly and sensibly so that there is a basis for amicable and purposeful discussion.<br><br>As the saying goes, if everyone takes the good ones, who would take the bad ones?<br><br>Looking through this thread, I personally feel:<br>1) As sbs_boy had pointed out, those 18 seater buses would be best. Hardly anyone would complain about seats being too crammed. But try putting them on high demand services during peak hour, and that includes svc 151. Next thing we know is that the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> people start complaining about unable to board the bus and starts another thread about too few bus seats. Let's say the bus companies decide to improve and spend more money on these buses. Bus fares go up as a result. The <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> people start complaining the bus fares increase.<br><br>Given the choice, would you want to tahan being crammed but able to board the next bus or a very spacious seat after waiting for like 1 hour during your daily commmute? Of course, the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> group of people will start blaming the PTC, LTA, SBST, SMRT and whoever else for the fare increase and yet they have to wait one hour for their bus. The bus companies can put in more buses, but with twice the number of buses on the roads, jams at bus stops, major roads and thus bunching of the same service is bound to occur. Not to mention the chaos at the bus interchanges. Again, the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> group would start complaining. Its a never ending cycle for 100% sastifaction.<br><br>2) One has to look at the demographic and economic situation of Singapore. Don't forget that when these MkIIs were procured, it was in response to the MRT system that was just being launched. These MkIIs were meant to be used on high capacity, high demand routes. In that time, passengers would probably be happy to squeeze onboard the bus and get a seat on what was then a spanking new bus as compared to the B57s etc. The Volvo MkIIs then featured revoluntionary design and technology. Similarly, 17 years down the road, the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> people might complain about B9TLs breaking down here, falling apart there and so lao pok.<br><br>3) For goodness sake, one problem that had plaqued this forum and caused much flaming and confusion among participants is the lack for specifics. Granted, the ordinary joe might not know the difference between a mkII and mkIV, but as someone as so correctly pointed out in the papers, they seem to remember the registration crystal clear when they lose something on board, down to the suffix of the rego; but when they complain they give sweeping specifics, of which the bus companies would be hard pressed to solve the problem. Of course they cannot take out the whole fleet to inspect. When they do, the <span style="font-style: italic;">same</span> people complain to the company and demand why is the poor frequency and start the bus fare hike issue all over again.<br><br>Thanks for reading and have a good week ahead.</div>
