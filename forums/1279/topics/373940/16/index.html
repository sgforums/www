              <p><br>i dun feel anything wrong wif ngjy's post. this is forums, anyone has got e right to post. and if u asked him to withdraw his remarks to avoid more conflict, den wad bout SBS9818A and service_238 s' posts? shldn't dey use a more appropriate tone and attitude to correct him?</p>
              <p>now, im not siding wif who. jus tat i feel sumtimes u guys can learn to be more courteous in e way ur type. n posting cameo lists in inter exits to me, seems to be spoon-feeding? so what is bus spotting if one gets spoon-fed? i believe e excitement of spotting a rare cameo on ur own would definitely outweigh any other ways on how e news of cameos are being spread. okay sbs233x is sarcastic bout it but he doesn't hav to reli paste e cameo list, like he owe u guys anything. all humans hav got e right to decide who we wan to inform. n sumtimes even after cameos hav been spread down, some ppl just dun forward them so does tat mean e fault lies wif e person hu spotted it initially? i noe im new here, but im just giving a piece of my mind.</p>

              <p>Come on, he has a lot of school commitments and isn't so free to run about everywhere to look out for ads. Frankly speaking, he only commutes between Bishan and Toa Payoh daily and the ads that can be seen in these two areas are limited.</p>
              <p>Tell me, without looking at Sgwiki as source, including those advertisements that were not spotted yet and not updated by anyone here. The EVERY SINGLE bus with the EVERY advertisements available here, name out all of them without anything wrong. I'm not trying to say that I know everything, I ask this because you seem to know everything.</p>
              <p>Given the sarcastic remark and attitude, you both seems to not know what is the meaning of forgiving, with such a very minor mistake. How often you get to see a different bus with this advertisement around, besides Orchard? Even if one of the bus is what you see daily, it's just that one bus.</p>
              <p>The following lines may seem familiar to some of them here</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>"there is a very well-defined line between constructive criticism and personal attacks. though there will be tendencies for people to misconstrue each other's intentions, however well-meaning they may be."</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>"don't even bother flaming the fella because it's not going to bring about any benefits at all. it will simply result in people mis-using their perceived "seniority" or people taking things personal. one important thing to remember, live and let live.."</em></span></p>

              <p>classic case of misintepretation of one's words. </p>
              <p>i don't profess to know everything, no one does. therefore i don't see how the "you seem to know everything" opinion comes about from one simple statement.</p>
              <p>if you want me to make things crystal clear, I will. if you're not sure about the validity or the accuracy of your statement, don't go about and post sweeping statements. clear and simple. mind you, there was no personal attack in that line. in no way was anyone out to attack his integrity. it was merely a reply to remind TS that 7493R is not the only bus with that ad.</p>
              <p>and there was no need to bring in his busy schedule to try and mitigate the fact that he "isn't so free to run about everywhere to look out for ads". i dare say i have even more committments not just in school, but also outside. but then again i still take pains to keep myself updated so that i know what's going on. so that line actually cuts no slack there. one's hectic schedule is not necessarily representative of one's level of engagement of the hobby.</p>

              <p>classic case of misintepretation of one's words. </p>
              <p>i don't profess to know everything, no one does. therefore i
              don't see how the "you seem to know everything" opinion comes
              about from one simple statement.</p>
              <p>if you want me to make things crystal clear, I will. if you're
              not sure about the validity or the accuracy of your statement,
              don't go about and post sweeping statements. clear and simple. mind
              you, there was no personal attack in that line. in no way was
              anyone out to attack his integrity. it was merely a reply to remind
              TS that 7493R is not the only bus with that ad.</p>
              <p>and there was no need to bring in his busy schedule to try and
              mitigate the fact that he "isn't so free to run about everywhere to
              look out for ads". i dare say i have even more committments not
              just in school, but also outside. but then again i still take pains
              to keep myself updated so that i know what's going on. so that line
              actually cuts no slack there. one's hectic schedule is not
              necessarily representative of one's level of engagement of the
              hobby.</p>

              <p>You claimed that I misinterpreted of what you guys commented on stage's post. Yes, I jolly well sense that you are proving to others that you have a strong command of english. Thus,  commented with that sentence. You may ask the other forumites, do you think that I really misinterpreted your words, or is the meaning of your words that you are trying to convey is so ambiguous that a lot of us here "misinterpreted it as an insult"? the kind of sacarsm in your post is definitely rude and uncouth. What do you expect from us? Stand in your shoes and understand why you post such a remark? </p>
              <div>
              <div>"SBS9830M fake bus ah?"</div>
              <div>This statement may seem to be humourous to you, but it can be degrading to one's wisdom. Trying to say that the person think 9830M is a fake. Don't you know that pen is mightier than sword? Physical harm is just superficial, but once you leave yourself a bad impression to others, others will psychologically condemn you, and thus stay away from you. If you didn't realise, your statement is just a double-edged sword. </div>
              <div>  </div>
              <div>Well, human beings make mistakes and I know stage well, because he's one of my closer friends and we do talk to each other everyday, be it on the phone, online or just a simple meal session during his free days. I am not making a sweeping statement. You may be interested to look at his daily schedules, he will be obliged to do so if you request it from him personally. I am not here listening to how much effort you spend on the hobby itself, or what kind of committments you have. I am aware that the proportion of engagement of hobby is not directly proportional to the amount of time spent for committments. Life these days is all about mobility and flexibility. Some fortunate people are able to do spotting in cars, travel around, and put in more effort in their hobbies. However, there are also people who are unaware of things, unable to keep themselves updated because their friends do not spot those either as the advertisement just appeared recently on buses and thats why no news is being disseminated. </div>

              <p>Have you ever heard of the chinese wisdom <em>"äººä¹‹åˆ�, æ€§æœ¬å–„"</em>?</p>
              <p>For the benefit of non chinese, it means that people are not born to be evil. In the first place, why would people have an axe to grind with other people when others did not provoke them? Even Adolf Hitler isn't born to be a dictator. There must be some form of catalyst which led to people welding the axe to grind others. I beg to differ what you have said. I am not surprised if stage claimed that your post is provocative, even though he does not have an axe to grind others initially, because you are the one whom actually provoked him, which result in such a long sequence of events which led to the dismay of most of us towards you. </p>
