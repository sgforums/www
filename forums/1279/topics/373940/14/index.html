              <p>True that there may be some elements that become fired up and flame away at small things, but there are also times that some folks do not know the height of the sky and the vastness of the land and post items or thoughts that show that they are just too small.</p>

              <p>yes. agreed in bold. however, it must at least be presentable. what i'll say is presentable is the subject of the photo, the bus, can be fully seen or almost fully seen or being taken as a portrait to the surrounding landscape, and not seen being cut off in all sorts of directions, upside down, diagonally. we'll take an example of a photo in this page of the topic, the 2 photos of 770T (excluding the photo of 770T being taken at the front) posted here, it may be acceptable by you but not acceptable by some if not many.</p>
              <p>respect is something we give, but respect is only given when that person deserves it. if his artwork is something which is less than to be called a work of art (maybe in the context of those who rate bus photos here), do you think he should get the respect? to me, i'll say no. given the numerous amount of bus fans posting bus photos here, the presenter, along with other bus fans who currently post photos at the same standard as him, can learn to observe the photos that the others post and try to take a photo of the bus, fully. no offence to those who may feel offended by this.</p>

              <p>There is nothing wrong to be creative, especially to find a good location for a shot in pleasant conditions. There's no need to doubt his shots. Am I right to say people always make noise over "DAF" pics? Now there are people who are moving their comments onto proper pics, so what's exactly the point of posting pics? </p>
              <p>And since one party has apologised, I don't see the reason why are some people still rubbing into it. Let's not be rude when you are asking a question, ok? Thanks.</p>

              <p>sigh, just look at hk forums. there's just a varse difference in the attitude of the people there. i see photos posted by our fellow HK enthusiasts with real dark spots, parts of the bus chipped off, some even blurred, its fine to the people there, why cant it be here?</p>
              <p>are we more superior? there's a difference between giving valuable advise and offensive criticism and there's a limit to everything.</p>
              <p>it's like a boy is learning how to cycle, his parents should not just scold at his falls and leave him be but to help and guide him thru the falls? why not those who feel they have the chops learn to teach with patience and not to scold at every little fault that is made? otherwise, i feel you dun have the chops to criticise unless you truly show that you are willing to be patient to slowly guide them.</p>
              <p>if they dun wanna cycle, just leave them its like talking to a wall.</p>
