            <div class='col-md body'>i really agreed to some suggestions that service 62 should terminate @ eunos interchange rather than geylang lor 1 cause it makes no differances in you want to travel towards city/west or central,you must change to another bus service.by the way eunos int does not have any bus travelling to north-east areas except for<br>passing by services (51) and this bus is normally packed almost all the time.this sound impossible,but at least i can see the volvo articulated or longbus if sbst implemented this bus model in it's fleet.by the way,i also think that service 42 should terminated @ eunos too instead of kembangan mrt cause many times i did saw drivers of this service go to eunos int to either punch card,meal breaks or whatever they need to do.one unique thing about this service is they using a 9.5m midibus dennis dart if i'm not wrong due to the constraint roads @ opera estates.anyway,this is just a suggestion,i don't really care if it does'nt come true.<br><br>regards</div>

I personally have taken a Mk III on the route and it handled quite suprisingly well(considering it was a Mk III, the bus many of us love to hate).

Sv. 92 Mk IIs into the narrow roads at Holland area? Hmm, wonder how they handle. Pity it's only Darts nowadays into the residential areas.</div>

It was amazing to see that the bus could negotiate the slopes and corners well. The trip was smooth sailing except for one part where the bus had to make a right turn at a T-junction. There was some road work and only 1 lane was passable. The bus had to "gostan" (reverse) a bit.</div>
