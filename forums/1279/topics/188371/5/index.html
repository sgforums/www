Get this into your god-damn head once and for all.<br><br>WE do not discourage this kind of talk, WE just hate such threads because they consume our time just to open so many threads when 1 can fit all if not most. YOU could have have accepted that couldn't you? But no.......you had to assert your rights in posting what you want when WE were telling you to complain where you should! Worse, you keep talking as though THAT fault on the MB0405 was the biggest you have ever seen! Get this straight, this is hardly worth complaining about. Sure, you can complain about it, but please do not create another thread like this ok? Must tell you nicely again since being nasty failed to get this message into your head.<br><br>Peace?! How do you breed peace when what we say fall on deaf ears?<br><br>PS: And I thought melculo was the worst we ever saw. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
