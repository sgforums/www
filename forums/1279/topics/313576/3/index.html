              <p>BNDEP currently have too many NAC buses already, compared to HGDEP and ARBP/BBDEP. Even short haul bus services like 11, 91, 92, 115, 191, 200 which were majority NAC fleets have now become FAC. Service 151 is much better off, from many NAC buses now have new Scania K230UB fleets. Just waiting for services like 6, 35, 37, 38 (originally FAC), 229, 292, 403 to become FAC fleets too. For those like services 19, 29, and other services that have majority OAC/CAC Scania N113 CRB fleets, which buses will replace them...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>Remember those times when PLAB services 90 and 94 had a lot of NAC Scania N113 CRBs from BRBP, but had eventually became FAC fleets when those NAC buses were transferred over to BNDEP, making things worse for BNDEP with full of NAC buses. If I am not mistaken, those NAC buses went over there to replace the outgoing MK2s last year??</p>
              <p>True for service 32 ARBP and BNDEP deployments...ARBP gives service 32 all the Volvo MK4 buses whereas BNDEP only gives old buses, worse till NAC buses too. Service 33 about the same, but not too bad. At least got some Volvo MK4s from BNDEP and do not have any NAC fleets.</p>
              <p>Will be good if services 32 and 33 gets the new Scania K230UBs from BNDEP once the Scania N113 CRBs are gone.</p>
              <p>For the VO2x to transfer from ARBP to SLBP, services 74 and 93 will sure benefit from the redeployments (at the expense of service 91 too <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png">). And it seems that by then SLBP will only be the SBST depot to have NAC buses. And since service 93 got the DD front desto, was wondering why it don't get AC DDs??</p>

However, I feel that the standing area should be replaced with a few seats. It is also good to use them during peak hours. Anyway, sgwiki didn't update the three Volvo B10TL buses: <span>SBS9813M</span>, SBS9820S and <span>SBS9823J. I also hope the K230UB can be used on service 222. <a href="http://sgwiki.com/wiki/Pasir_Ris%2C_Tampines%2C_Bedok_feeders">http://sgwiki.com/wiki/Pasir_Ris%2C_Tampines%2C_Bedok_feeders</a></span></p></div>

              <p>all this is not gonna happen jus yet. although there are 2 K230UBs seen inside BNDEP, they would not deploy on a service like 31 as there are too few singledecker blocks. I also dun wan the K230UBs to be on this service. i rather 32 and 33 get to replace their dilapidated fleet. if you compare BN 32 with AR 32's fleet, you will get what I mean.</p>
              <p>the remaining AR/BB VO2x will have to go to SLBP in time to come. SLBP is in need of VO2x. and putting them in SLBP is an ideal solution as they can put NAC buses far away from town. BNDEP would rather take the SP DM3500s from SLBP than the VO2x. BNDEP has too many NAC buses. you want Bedok, Tampines and Pasir Ris to be infested with NACs?</p>
              <p>if thats so. send the BNDEP B9TL over to Soon Lee to put on JIS instead as an exchange <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>SLBP dun need as much NAC buses as before liao. Cos they change most of their JIS svc to PAC. From the current no of spare VO2x you would know. SBS would be happen to put in more AC buses on JIS svcs to earn more money! U can see all the cameo for JIS svcs are AC buses. I dun see why VO2x cannot be deployed in the East side. </p>

              <p><br>I take 222 often so if there is 1 or 2 VO2x, I will just wait for the next bus. I do not wish to see any service getting downgraded from FAC to PAC. There are enough Double-decks for 222 right now. By the way, are you sure the route for 222 is so short? 359 is a PAC now so should be ok for 359 to get VO2x. Another suggestion is 354, which has only 2 buses right now. Maybe SBS should convert the VO2x to CAC buses?</p>

              <p><br>HG feeders also had NAC MB0305 DDs in 2001 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>Those days when VO2x were scatted all around the SBST depots in Singapore, after year 2003 majority of the VO2x fleets all pushed to SLBP to replace the LO2x. Remembered services 35, 107, 165, 186 etc that used to have NAC VO2x, after which they were replaced with AC buses or NAC SD buses.</p>
