            <div class='col-md body'>I vividly remember a very weird advertisement on DDs back in 1992. On one side there were words like "I SEE", "I HEAR", "I LIKE" etc. and on the other side were the words "NOW U CAN" with a big red letter U. I was scrathing my head trying to figure out what it was all about. It was not until much, much later that the words "PANASONIC - NOW U CAN" came out. Geez.<br><br>And who can forget the "CARRIER MAN CAN" ad. This ad was the first to be painted wholly on a single-deck bus. There were 2 buses, I think which had this. One was a Scania on sv. 16 and the other was a Mk-II B10M on sv. 174. These 2 buses created such a confusion that it was featured in the papers. People thought they weren't SBS buses and so didn't take them. That is why the front of today's buses were left unpainted.<br><br>On Atlanteans, there was one ad I liked which was for MAS.
