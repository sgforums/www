SBST did take into account of what you have written but they have LISTENED to the majority of sv151 commuters, ie why sv151 is mainly Non Aircon bus. besides sv154 is more or less parallel with sv151. If you would like an Air-Con ride, you can take sv154, DD somemore!</div></blockquote>Given the current state of the road and the amount of construction going on around, I think it'll be good to have an air-con service to get home. Anyway, bus 154 goesn't serve my purpose. A long day in school followed by a ride on a old, crummy bus has gotta be one of the worst ways to end a day.</div>

It all boils down to the SC. In addition, hw long did u wait for? coz the freq is 14mins tops, mayb tt is y it takes so long, it does cover part LRT route, so SMRT might be indirectly directing commuters to take LRT. Finally, take note of theovercrowding timings and write to SMRT to feed back or they will never take action. Wrt to the UD buses, you have to live with it...</div>
