            <div class='col-md body'>I have one today. I was booking out, because I can't walk fast or run  because of my back problem. This bus 103, SBS486 stopped at the bus stop just before I get to the bus stop. I kept waving hoping the bus driver  wait for me, the others passengers saw me . Before I knew it, the bus driver closed the door and drove ff . Usually the bus will stay there for about 2-3 minutes but this time, the driver decided to drive on without looking at his rear mirror.<br><br>How about you guys ?<br><br></div>

It can be very pissing if you are in a hurry or something.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A fully packed single deckbus came  and you are one of those who are unable to board and have to wait for the next one. The frequency of each bus is around 20 mins and the worst thing is most of the DD buses you see on this same service going towards opposite direction are back to back . The next bus that comes is also a single deck which is just as pack.  &lt;- No prize for guessing what bus service I am refering to.<br><br>This is very common.</div>
