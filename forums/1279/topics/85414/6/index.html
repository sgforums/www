            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why TIBS didn't opt for DDs is that they don't have the proper facilities for them. Bendys are not much of a problem because they are single decks after all. Buying DDs would mean the need to renovate their depots to accomodate them.<br><br>The same goes for SBS. Having designed their depots for DDs with the proper facilites and equipment to match, what will become of them if bendys were bought instead? They have toyed with the idea but found it more feasible to stick with DDs; although I would like SBS to purchase more bendys for those high passenger routes with height restrictions (eg: 105).</div>

I saw the driver looking at me but instead of waiting for me, he closed the door and drove off . I guess this is very common. Luckily I had alternatives but still was very pissed off with this driver.</div>
