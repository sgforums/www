Service 101 is there because of the closure of Hougang South Int.. it was service 328.. after they closed down Hougang South.. then there was 101.. for 82.. the reason that it stops over there is because it runs almost the same as NEL.. so... it was then amanded to served Serangoon Int instead of Shenton Way Terminal..

If you yourself doesnt like to take the NEL.. that doesnt mean that other ppl wouldnt take the NEL... if you dont believe.. i think.. you try to make a trip down to Serangoon Int and MRT station in the MOrning and Evening and see for yourself whether there are ppl taking NEL.. Yes.. i do agree that by takin NEL, it cost more money.. but.. in the mean time, you actually spend less time on the road.. and.. People living in Hougang Ave9, they need not take 103,70 to Serangoon Int.. for a faster way, some of the ppl there would take a bus to Hougang Int before making a transit for NEL.. When NEL was open, ppl living in Hougang Ave 8 was NOT affected in any way AT ALL.. there was only a withdrawal of Express Service 502 and 501.. Ppl staying over at hougang Ave8 had only 147 that serve the city area EVEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF NEL.. (if youre talking about NON Express Service..).. And.. Serangoon is NOT a TERMINAL.. Serangoon is an INTERCHANGE.. it have Feeder Service that stops there.. So.. it is not Called Terminal but an Interchange instead.. i believe you rarely go down to Serangoon INTERCHANGE bahx.. ?? in fact.. it is NOT A GHOST TOWN AT ALL.. there are alot of other Interchange that is even WORST than Serangoon.. Pls do not blame Serangoon for anything just because Hougang Ave 8/9 doesnt have any service that serve the city except 147.. and Pls do Not use the Word Useless.. if it is Useless.. it wouldnt even be there in the 1st place..

Note tt sv854 brings commuters to YCK, HGN industrial &amp; residential estate from YIs. It is an invaluable svc and also very quick. <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">PLEASE</span></span> do not make any recommendation to amend any route unless there is a real valid reason to do so.

Service 101 is there because of the closure of Hougang South Int.. it was service 328.. after they closed down Hougang South.. then there was 101.. for 82.. the reason that it stops over there is because it runs almost the same as NEL.. so... it was then amanded to served Serangoon Int instead of Shenton Way Terminal.. SBST did wanted to cut the line completely.. but.. it was to stay because that 82 pass by quite a number of schools in Hougang/SengKang/Punggol Area.. it is like a school bus service.. There is something that i would like to add.. If you yourself doesnt like to take the NEL.. that doesnt mean that other ppl wouldnt take the NEL... if you dont believe.. i think.. you try to make a trip down to Serangoon Int and MRT station in the MOrning and Evening and see for yourself whether there are ppl taking NEL.. Yes.. i do agree that by takin NEL, it cost more money.. but.. in the mean time, you actually spend less time on the road.. and.. People living in Hougang Ave9, they need not take 103,70 to Serangoon Int.. for a faster way, some of the ppl there would take a bus to Hougang Int before making a transit for NEL.. When NEL was open, ppl living in Hougang Ave 8 was NOT affected in any way AT ALL.. there was only a withdrawal of Express Service 502 and 501.. Ppl staying over at hougang Ave8 had only 147 that serve the city area EVEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF NEL.. (if youre talking about NON Express Service..).. And.. Serangoon is NOT a TERMINAL.. Serangoon is an INTERCHANGE.. it have Feeder Service that stops there.. So.. it is not Called Terminal but an Interchange instead.. i believe you rarely go down to Serangoon INTERCHANGE bahx.. ?? in fact.. it is NOT A GHOST TOWN AT ALL.. there are alot of other Interchange that is even WORST than Serangoon.. Pls do not blame Serangoon for anything just because Hougang Ave 8/9 doesnt have any service that serve the city except 147.. and Pls do Not use the Word Useless.. if it is Useless.. it wouldnt even be there in the 1st place.. So... Pls mind what you say and think before you type it down... </div></blockquote>I do agree that NEL helps to shorten the traveling time.  One of the reason why people dislike about the NEL rationalisation is that there more transfer trips, it a hassle and with all the waiting time for the transfer, one does not gain much form taking NEL, even though we have to pay more. Talking about going to Chinatown. I disagree with you that a faster alternative is to take to Hougang Central and tansfer NEL. Why does one need to travel 2 Station up if one could just transfer to NEL at serangoon.</div>

If he feels that the trip to SGN station is smoother[lesser traffic lights or bus loading], he will utilise SGN. On the other hand the commuter might feel that by taking NEL to HGN stn, he/she will be able to get a seat and have a nap or the trip to HGN stn from where they are staying is shorter. So it all boils down to the individual's preferences.<br></div>

SBST did take into account of what you have written but they have LISTENED to the majority of sv151 commuters, ie why sv151 is mainly Non Aircon bus. besides sv154 is more or less parallel with sv151. If you would like an Air-Con ride, you can take sv154, DD somemore!</div>

But now when these nonsence craps came in, svc 920's frequency started to become longer.. Most of the time nowadays svc 920 only deploy 2 UD buses instead of the usual 3 MB Buses last time.. I dun even have to complain abt how lousy the UD buses can be.. I juz need to complain abt the frequency of the svc and because of tat, the UD buses are sometimes very packed in the afternoon when the students are dismissed from the schools nearby, and it makes the UD buses so hot &amp; stuffy, especially the CAC UD Buses tat serves svc 920 routes before i.e TIB 1248 D to TIB 1253 M.. Anyone here has any idea why svc 920 is getting more and more lousier?
