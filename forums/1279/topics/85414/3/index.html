Living in Serangoon.. ive kinda got used to this already.. 158 is not the only service... 100 is also 1 of them.. sometimes, if you go to Serangoon Interchange at roung 7 plus in the evening, you will find that none of the 100 bus is in sight.. this is because, there us alwayz a jam over at Sims Ave.. in the evening... 158 also pass by that rd.. thats why it is also affected by it.. 100 is not so bad as after Sims Ave, its quite smooth after that.. but as for 158, other sims Ave, 158 it still have to pass by Upp Paya Lebar Rd.. another famouse Jam area.. due to the construction of Circle Line and KPE.. thats why 158 and 100 have problems keepin up to their timetable..</div>

The only bus to that area..) and 101(Hougang/BungKok area).. as for service like 70, 22 and 53.. for your info.. 70 will proceed straight after Serangoon Central and uses Yio Chu Kang Rd.. 22 will turn Left to Boundary Rd/Lor Chuan/AMK Ave 1n and stops at AMK Interchange.. for 53, after AMK Ave1, it turn into Bishan Rd then proceed to Bishan Interchange.. So.. i dont its right when you say that all buses proceed to the same area.. yA.. i admit that 53 and 22 do have the same route from Serangoon Central to AMK Ave1.. but.. both buses serve different kinds of 'Market".. 22 for those going towards Tam.. 53, for those going to/fro Airport... Well.. 1 last thing.. other than 100 serving the city, there is also service 147 and 107 which serve City Areas as well...</div>

The only bus to that area..) and 101(Hougang/BungKok area).. as for service like 70, 22 and 53.. for your info.. 70 will proceed straight after Serangoon Central and uses Yio Chu Kang Rd.. 22 will turn Left to Boundary Rd/Lor Chuan/AMK Ave 1n and stops at AMK Interchange.. for 53, after AMK Ave1, it turn into Bishan Rd then proceed to Bishan Interchange.. So.. i dont its right when you say that all buses proceed to the same area.. yA.. i admit that 53 and 22 do have the same route from Serangoon Central to AMK Ave1.. but.. both buses serve different kinds of 'Market".. 22 for those going towards Tam.. 53, for those going to/fro Airport... Well.. 1 last thing.. other than 100 serving the city, there is also service 147 and 107 which serve City Areas as well... </div></blockquote>Heehee that's right...

            <div class='col-md body'>Ironic you guys are talking about Serangoon, because the service I want to complain most about it....a bus to serangoon!<br><br>My nemesis is service 53. Sometimes, its a good boy and comes on time, or at leasts comes regularly. But for some reason, it is almost impossible to predict its frequency during peak hours. Sometimes it comes it takes more then 20 mins, sometimes 2 mins, and I am talking about practically the same time slot every morning.<br><br>And to think that all I need to do was take the bus from Lorong Ah Soo to Serangoon MRT....only a 3 bus stop distance bus ride. Waiting 25 mins for a 5 min ride can be truly exasperating (and just as exasperating when I took to walking, only to see the bus happily driving by me as I sweated on my way to the station)!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
