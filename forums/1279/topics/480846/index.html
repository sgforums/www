              <p>Christopher Tan. (2014, March 7). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New bus service from Telok Blangah</strong></span>. <em>The Straits Times</em>. Retrieved from <a title="http://www.straitstimes.com/" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/new-bus-service-telok-blangah-20140307">http://www.straitstimes.com/ </a></p>
              <blockquote><div class="quote_body">
              <p>A new bus service will ply between Telok Blangah and the Tiong Bahru and Outram MRT stations from next Sunday.</p>
              <p>SBS Transit Bus Service 121 is a new trunk service that will connect commuters from Ganges Avenue, Kim Tian Road and Telok Blangah Crescent/Rise to Tiong Bahru and Outram Park MRT stations.</p>
              <p>Operating daily from 6am to 11.30pm from New Bridge Road Bus Terminal, Service 121 will ply Outram Road, Zion Road, Ganges Avenue, Lower Delta Road, Tiong Bahru Road, Kim Tian Road, Jalan Bukit Merah, Lower Delta Road and Telok Blangah Way, before looping back via Telok Blangah Crescent and Telok Blangah Rise. As Zion Road is one way, the service will ply Outram Road in the return direction.</p>
              <p>Besides enhancing connectivity to key transport nodes such as Tiong Bahru and Outram Park MRT stations, the new bus service will also provide residents with convenient access to amenities like Singapore General Hospital, Outram Polyclinic, Safra Mount Faber, Tiong Bahru Plaza, markets and food centres along Jalan Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah Crescent, as well as schools such as Radin Mas Primary School and CHIJ St Theresa's Convent.</p></div>

              <p>It will do much better than 120 according to me. It will relieve loading on 195, providing other options for residents living there. Also good to see Ganges and Tiong Bahru connected. The new stop along Kim Tian should also benefit residents. </p>

              <p>Yes I still don't know why 48 should not be BNDEP controlled. Can save on so much dead mileage. Also 52 should be AMDEP minority control. 120, 121 should be ARBP instead. 14, 16 should have more BNDEP duties.</p>

Anyway still better for Zion road residents coz now direct bus to Tiong Bahru MRT. They would have to walk across to Outram road earlier and only had one way bus connectivity to MRT.

              <p>My grandma stays in Telok Blangah Rise, and according to her residents have been asking for a svc linking that area to Tiong Bahru MRT for years, since 272 only goes to Bukit Merah Ctrl and doesn't serve any MRT stations. This svc will be useful for residents at Telok Blangah, Kim Tian and Ganges Ave to get to MRT stations and amenities like SGH. I think it may be more popular than 120 since Tiong Bahru there got shopping centre also, unlike 120 which connects to Telok Blangah MRT which is mostly a transfer point rather than the destination itself.</p>
              <p>Separately, posters about new svc 121 have been put up at the void decks of the flats in Telok Blangah, though there hasn't been anything at the bus stops as of yesterday.</p>

              ARBP should control all the loop services originating from CBD, ie 120, 121, 400 &amp; 402 in addition to 195.
              
              Your proposal for Route 14 is lovely. 16 also can go partial BN.

              Having new bus routes in CCK would be more exciting. The situation in N6 (St 62/YWT) has remained the same since 1999.

              <p><br>I agree with you. This route will be very successful according to me.
