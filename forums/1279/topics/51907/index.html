There is no development of any sort within 150m of the road, and no one needs a link between Ave 1 and Ring Rd as it would only save them 2 minutes, but even then, traffic will be super low.<br><br>Personally, I would prefer the original route, esp since it would save the residents at the opposite Blk418  bus stop at least 5 minutes compared to the new route.

Youre dramatising it abit... Its true that most 804s are packed like crazy when 806 does not operate and the record breaking long queues but the frequency for 804 is pretty ok except for the occasionally hiccupps. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ANd 806 loads in the morning peak are quite unpredictable i can say..

I guess its becos not that many people travel to blk 200+ side but rather go directly to the mrt.

Sometimes if the loading and unloading gets delayed, 806 can take longer than 804 to reach the int!<br><br>anyways, have u got any idea when they bendies will start operating or what model will they use?

Volgren O405Gs are based at Woodlands while majority of Yishun services have their buses coming from AMK Depot.</div>
