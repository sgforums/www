There was never any O 303 in Singapore, except perhaps only 1 LHD unit which i saw from Germany in transit in C&amp;C in Singapore years ago !<br>Reg. plate i think was 'PA-PA 16'. Was told it was on a round-the-world trip !!<br>That's the real original coach &amp; Singapore didn't seem up to the standard to afford a coach of such class !! Those which SBS used in its air-con service route 168 were O 302 &amp; even then maybe the coachwork wasn't the original M-B O 302 coachwork but possibly only an OF 1413 with a close copied coachwork of the real O 302 !! Tell tale signs to me would be the Nissan rear lampset &amp; the driver door handle not using the curved handle which the real O 302 would have used. I recall the glass was from Dumrong Thailand instead of Selkurit or Sigla if a real M-B original coachbody.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, I was referring to those first batch of A/C buses on svc 168 at that time.<br>But the "Singapore Bus Handbook" by Danny Chan (pg 102 &amp; 103) stated this model as MB O303....is that a typo error on the book?</div>
