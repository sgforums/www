            <div class='col-md body'>Some bus services were victims of MRT rationalisation, but a select few didn't get any major change or survived unscathed. Others were enhanced or revived in a different form. So far, I gather that these are:<br><br><ul>002: Changi Village to New Bridge Rd, duplicating the East-West Line from Tanah Merah down to the CBD. Previously went up to Buona Vista via Redhill. SBS could have shortened it to Eunos and closed Changi Village Terminal if they had been ruthless. Then we'd be having Svc 2 operating from Eunos and looping at Changi Village using HGDEP (now BRAM) buses.<br><br>081: The only direct link from Hougang to Pasir Ris. Cannot cut any further.<br><br>107: Previously a Serangoon-Shenton Way loop service, it was extended to Hougang to make up for lost connections following the rationalisation of 82 &amp; 97.<br><br>119: The old Svc 860 back from the dead. Mainly serves students in the northeast area.<br><br>147: Northeast Line anchor, plying between Hougang and Clementi via Serangoon Central, Little India, Chinatown, Redhill and Queenstown. Also meant as partial cover for Svc 2. Could have ended up as a Clementi-Suntec City loop service, linking Chinatown with Suntec City long before Citybuzz was launched. A side note, CSS 604 should not have been culled back in the 1980s. The area around Marina Centre/Nicoll Highway has had much development over the years.<br><br>198: Shortened from Sims Place to Bukit Merah to ensure the continued existence of Svc 64. I remember HGDEP and JRBP supplying O305s and LO2Xes respectively to this route. Later dominated by LAs from BBDEP. Amended to ply Queensway instead of Queenstown MRT as a result.<br><br>960: Introduced as compensation for the loss of Svcs 950 &amp; 952 following the opening of the Woodlands Extension of the North-South Line. If I'm not mistaken, those who benefitted most were SJI &amp; SCGS students from Woodlands.<br><br>970: Introduced to make up for the loss of Svc 5 when the Bukit Panjang LRT came into being. Plies Hillview Ave, Bukit Batok and Jln Jurong Kecil to avoid duplicating Svc 961. As for why it doesn't serve Queenstown Library like Svc 5 did, only SMRT Buses' route planners have the answers.</ul></div>

But that is a problem for the 2 rival operators to sort out. TransitLink can't issue direct orders like how Transperth does.<br><br>While Chinatown has no cheap direct connections to Marina Centre, Orchard commuters are spoilt for choice with 106 and 111 calling at Temasek Ave &amp; Blvd in addition to 36. Also, 2 of the weekend services (162X, 700A) come from Orchard. Perhaps 961C should go to Suntec area as well.<br><br>Suggestion to SMRT buses: Make 106 call twice at Suntec City like 864 in the not-so-distant past, and re-route 961C such that it links Chinatown with Suntec as well as Marina Square.<br><br>For eg: Towards Geylang Fringe - High St, (St Andrews Rd, Beach Rd), Raffles Ave, 107X route to Beach Rd then normal route.<br><br>Towards Woodlands - Beach Rd, (Bras Basah Rd, Raffles Ave), 700A route towards City Hall then normal route.</div>
