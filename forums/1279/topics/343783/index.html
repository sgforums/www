              <p>This is interesting. People just don't feel ashame of blocking the passage of the bus.</p>
              <p>I've also seen TTS onboard 8033D sv174 peeping at the timesheet. Acting as if a terrorist. That's not the worse. The WORST is that his bag was at the seats, taking up space.</p>

              <p>btw this isnt the first time such incident has happened.</p>
              <blockquote>Quoted from a post from previous threads
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Occurences on SMB 1 H (01 July 2008, 1830 hours)</strong></span></p>
              <p>I was onboard SMB 1 H on its trip travelling towards Choa Chu Kang. I was observing things around, and to my horrid, I have found out something, and it has also been identified by the commuters onboard as well.</p>
              <p>A bus fan feedbacked to me that a couple of passengers telling him this:<br><br>Pax 1: "Hey, are you part of the group? Are you able to get them to <em><strong>shut up</strong>?<em> It's getting onto my nerve!!!</em></em></p>
              <p>Pax 2: "It has been a stressful day for me! I've been slogging for the whole day and I wanted a peaceful ride on it. Hear the noises coming from the back of the bus! It's f***ing irritating! <strong>CAN I HAVE SOME PEACE</strong>?!"</p>
              <p>THIS, has become a rising concern with this <strong>handful of bus fan</strong> who have been <strong>seating at the rear</strong> of the bus to become much 'outstanding' in the sense that they have been interrupting the peace, or even sleep for some of these poor working people.</p>
              <p>WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE <strong>SITUATION AWARENESS</strong> OF BUS FANS?! IS THIS A SIGN THAT FOR SOME THAT IT HAS <strong>WEAKENED</strong>?!</p>
              <p>Upon knowing that, I was <strong>furiously ashamed</strong> with their wrongdoings. Isn't it a basic courtesy that one <strong>MUST NOT</strong> have loud conversation on buses?</p>
              <p>Yes... it has been an exciting day for some of us to be boarding it, but does it have to be <strong>AMPLIFIED</strong> and becomes a form of inconvenience to others? And how much impact has this handful of people created and have never feel ashamed with their inconsiderate actions??!!</p>
              <p>I hope that this <strong>handful of them</strong> who have conversed loudly on the bus <strong>NOT</strong> to do such acts again. Not only that it brings us shame, the bad image portrayed to other commuters would be magnified as well!</p>
              <p>As a bus enthusiast, I hope that all of us should carry out the right disposition onboard, as well as to have the right moral values and considerate acts while onboard.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Again, I hope that this incident would never be re-enacted. </span><span style="color: #000000;"><em>(well, such inconsiderate actions have been re-enacted over and over again, just that we didnt notice perhaps.)</em></span></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So please, be considerate</span></span>. The driver needs to earn an income to support his family and if he were to lose his job due to some stupid buggers who distract him, are those buggers who are involved able to pay for the loss?</p>

I gave my seat to one of the elderly, and stood at the ticket box there as i want to see how the dashboard look like, took some pics before i alighted the bus at Yishun Interchange.</p>

              <p>okay , i was on board SMB63D and i was talking to the captain ... i agree with what u said but i didn't block the passengers from boarding as i was standing by the side near the first seat , why can't i chat with my friend? the thing is he's okay with us talking to him , i dont think SMRT will be so particular about passengers talking to captains , so what u want now? i'll try not to talk too much okay?problem settled?mod , pls lock this topic , thx (:</p>

              <p><br>okay, since you said u are standing by the side near the first seat, you are still obstructing the pathway. and the only way that you can definitely say that you are not obstructing passengers from boarding is either when you are sitting down or moving in towards the back of the bus.</p>
              <p>moreover, no one says you can't chat with your friend. you can jolly well chat with him when he's taking a break in the interchange/terminal or on the phone. or are you trying to say that he's only your friend when he's driving thats why you can only talk to him on the bus?</p>
              <p>furthermore you claimed that you dont think that SMRT will be particular about passengers talking to captains. asking for directions is fine, but definitely not standing there and talking throughout the journey. if somebody sends in a complaint to SMRT (or even STOMP/ST forums), do you think SMRT will just treat it as nothing has happened? and what is more important, reputation of SMRT or the comfort of captains?</p>
              <p>think again and grow up, boy.</p>
