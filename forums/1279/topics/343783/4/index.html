              <p>Learn from mistakes... </p>
              <p>Its part and parcel of life.. People make mistake, you should point it out to them, directly. Not by typing it out in the forum or somewhere, unless you are trying to shame them, intentionally. </p>
              <p>I know, I am just small little tiny winy guy, who hasn't met any busfans yet, except for a few. I've made many mistakes too... Tell me of a person who hasn't made any mistakes since the day he/she is born.</p>
              <p>I've talked to the drivers before.. It was during one of the trips frm Sembawang to Bkt Merah. I talk to him whenever he stopped at a traffic light, or even when he started a short convo with me. I don't mind. I know they have the responsibility to take care of the passengers inside the bus. Some may go over the limits, but there is still time to pull them back before the limit. It is a matter of whether they want or not. If they dont want, just leave it as it is. It is his/her problem if he got scolded/reprimanded/arrested or whatsoever. </p>
              <p>To the three guys whom the TS referred in the earliest post, I hope you may take this as a lesson. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, I (and other bus fans) should agree to what the TS is trying to point out certain misconduct while onboard public buses. I felt that drivers must observe certain safety regulations and some other form of "Guidelines" so that the driver's can fully concentrate on his driving to allow the whole journey to be smoother and also to complete on time without any distractions by anybody (be it bus fans or passengers) or to bring nuisance / embarassment to the rest of the passengers onboard the bus. If any passengers were to complain to SMRT (like what others have mentioned), he may get expelled or fired from the company one day. Think over what I've just said, and also my advice posted in this thread on the previous page. I don't want any drivers, whether from SBST or SMRT, to have a bad day just because he got extremely distracted or annoyed by anybody as a result. This kind of statement is self-explanatory, you can talk to the SLs or BCs for long periods or throughout the whole journey, but one day a member of the public complain goes to the relevant bus companies, the driver may be expelled from driving, and you might one day bear the consequences &amp; also entirely responsible for the actions that you have done to make the SLs or BCs being expelled.</div>

              the relevant bus companies, the driver may be expelled from
              driving, and you might one day bear the consequences &amp; also
              entirely responsible for the actions that you have done to make the

                      well, you should turn over a new leaf and follow my advice seriously. No point crying over split milk. I'm sure you can't just simply in a sudden saying that you wanted to give up on your bus hobby or sort of things. You have a second chance to move on, although you have learnt the mistakes and not to repeat all over again.
