              <p><br>Ok...so i will give you an example. If some people commits a mistake in their favourite hobby, e.g. being fans of Hello Kitty and they made themselves a nuisance at a Hello Kitty event, should the Hello Kitty hobby be eradicated too? Think before you talk.</p>
              <p>By your logic, it means that every enthusiasm, hobby and interest should be totally eradicated if a problem arises. We are not perfect beings.</p>
              <p>As i have pointed out, its another lesson learned and this adds to the experiences of the hobbyist. Unless the offender had been warned several times, if not, they should deserve another chance.</p>

              <p>im not flaming anyone but if this topic offends you, i apologize
              to you in advance..</p>
              <p>i was onboard 171 towards yishun (smb63d), journey at around
              6.15-7pm today.. there were 3 boys (2 chinese aged approx 12 and 15
              and 1 malay aged approx 15) onboard as well.. the malay boy
              was sitting right behind the driver directly and the 2 chinese boys
              were standing next to the driver.. asking sl questions and talking
              to him through out the journey..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if the 3 of you are sgforum forumites, pls take note / consider
              these important factors when you are having a joyride..</p>
              <p>- you are blocking passengers from boarding the bus
              smoothly..</p>
              <p>- you are diverting the drivers concentration by talking and
              asking him all the gadgets and equipments at the front dash though
              out the journey.. all passengers' life are in his hands.. and it
              was peak hour and there are about 30-40 pax onboard at any one time
              through out my journey from bt panjang to chong pang..</p>
              <p>- if someone makes a complaint, i can confidently say that he
              may be liable to be sacked by smrt.. don ask me why and how i
              know..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know that i may have stopped the 2 boys but pls i din
              wanna embarrass the 2 of them in front of peak hour
              crowd.. </p>
              <p>so please consider your actions when you are having
              joyrides..</p>

              <p>I don't see, in anyway, directly or indirectly, that this matter gets on your nerves. What's the use of making one thread to blow so much matters up. There's no more space in the first page due to the many stickies. Unless you are trying to tell me that you are the kind of people that is sensitive. Fine, I admit that I was the chinese <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">boy</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> you mentioned earlier on. We didn't talk very loud. If the driver is annoyed by or talking or disturbing his driving, he would have told us way beforehand and we would obey him. Fine, I let you win, if you think that you are right, go ahead. I rather let the matter be solved quickly than letting it drag and affect our daily lives. I want this problem to be solved quickly. I'm really sorry that this trivial matter has become a blown up matter and resulted in a new thread in the forums. If you really want to pursue the matter, I can't stop you also, I only can hope that this matter won't affect our daily lives. Please, I kneel before you, think before you create a new thread, what impact will cause us in the forums. If you think embarrassing us in the bus isn't right then why are you posting this kind of thread in the forums?</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you really want to talk to any SLs or BCs while in the bus, you have to know your limits well, do not cross the line. Don't talk when the bus is fully packed to the brim or for the entire journey. The best thing is to sit in the front (if you can find any) then you can talk to the BCs directly without standing in front of the drivers cabin and to obstruct the passageway when the entrance door is open to pick up passengers from any bus stop (i.e. Bus hogging). Should the SL or BC rejects your decision, <strong>DO NOT</strong> KEEP PESTERING ANY OF THE DRIVERS as they might get annoyed or distracted throughout the whole journey.<br><br>And lastly, do limit yourself a max of 5 mins. Please take my advice seriously.</p></div>

              <p>TS, I know it's nice to bully small kids. Nice right? Feel good inside you. I tell you, we may be kids, but we also have feelings, we got a brain. How would you feel, if something similar happen to you when you were young? Yes, you might have a hard time off work, angry and this gets on your nerves. But, I ask you this, what right does it gives you to exposed us so badly in the forums? If you think you want to have a score to settle, settle when the bus isn't so full.</p>

              <p><br>Just by "submitting", do you think the problem will really be solved? I give you the worse case scenario now. A passenger complains into SMRT Customer Relations that there are a bunch of boys "distracting the driver in the course of his work", what is the outcome then? You get away scot-free since you are not bounded by contract terms of SMRT, but what happens to the driver? I reiterate my point that this driver has only been in SMRT for less than 5 months and anything can cause him to lose his job. Do you want to be the one that makes the driver suffer?</p>
              <p>Yes you apologise. But are there any steps taken to ENSURE that it won't happen again? I suggest that you reflect on your personal boundaries as a bus enthusiast, what to do and what nots, and what is the boundary line which you can touch BUT not step over. Yes you may feel that manjieass created a din by starting this topic, but I still believe he did it to give you people a chance. You should be lucky that he is giving you a chance and not reporting it to the management, just imagine that the person onboard the bus isn't manjieass but someone senior from the management who just happens to have his off-day and is taking the bus. And that's the end of the driver's job. So you like that?</p>
              <p>You, as someone who is in the spotlight for doing such unnecessary things, should feel remorseful and not still be so ignorant as to feel that someone is trying to spoil your enthusiam in this hobby. I rather manjieass knocks some sense into you NOW than LATER when that driver gets something distasteful thanks to you.</p>

              <p>Yes you apologise. But are there any steps taken to ENSURE
              that it won't happen again? I suggest that you reflect on your
              personal boundaries as a bus enthusiast, what to do and what nots,
              and what is the boundary line which you can touch BUT not step
              over. Yes you may feel that manjieass created a din by starting
              this topic, but I still believe he did it to give you people a
              chance. You should be lucky that he is giving you a chance and not
              reporting it to the management, just imagine that the person
              onboard the bus isn't manjieass but someone senior from the
              management who just happens to have his off-day and is taking the
              bus. And that's the end of the driver's job. So you like that?</p>
              <p>You, as someone who is in the spotlight for doing such
              unnecessary things, should feel remorseful and not still be so
              ignorant as to feel that someone is trying to spoil your enthusiam
              in this hobby. I rather manjieass knocks some sense into you
              NOW than LATER when that driver gets something distasteful thanks
              to you.</p>

              <p>Ok. If this offends you, I'm sorry. I will try my best to prevent this from happening. However, what do you think about our reputation. People will lose faith in us. This is another major factor that is making us lose interest in the hobby. Ok, I don't really care much about my reputation but what do you think, in future, what will other bus fans think of me. They will think of me as a needle in their foot. What a huge burden. I could like just give up my hobby.</p>
