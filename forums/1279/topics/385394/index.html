              <p>56 units to be exact,But AMDEP @ WLDEP have to give some bendies to KJDEP in order to have equal share of the WAB Bendies.BTW i feel that majority of Citaros will go to WLDEP first...I really hope that they buy Volvo B9Ls or even Scania K270UB.Higer euro V also not bad,Using Scania technology</p>

              <p>LTA has already banned the purchases of bendy bus in future, so most likely there will not be new bendy buses from 2020 onwards. Unless LTA unlift the ban in future.</p>
              <p>Spoken personally to an LTA personnel before. One of their objective is to reduce queueing of buses along bus stops and thus to reduce jams and long queues along bus bays and bus lanes so as to facilitate more buses along bus lanes/bays at one time. So they might also reduce bus services as well when more rail lines come up in future.Thus I believe this is one of the reasons they want to ban the bendy buses.</p>
              <p>Central planning by LTA doesn't seems to be a good news after all...</p>

              <p>Agreed but at least they maintance the engine well enough than AMDEP ones.Dun mind they just sell off the box and Hispano MKII somewhere else(56 plus 29) to somewhere else..Bring in 60 units of WAB bendys where there still time.But again if they were to unable to buy bendys and bought DDs instead they have to restructure back their depot especially the height limit at WLDEP.BTW the topic is about new WAB bendy buses not about finding fault which buses is the worst right?So dun go haywire.</p>

              <p>By the time Bukit Timah line is up, there will be more reliance on rail rather than buses in the northwest corridor. SMRT would prefer to focus more on rail instead.</p>
              <p>By that time, 190 won't need any more bendies as commuters will be "forced" to take the MRT instead. And it will be a miracle that 190 is not withdrawn or shortern by that time.</p>

              <p>Other than Hillview Ave where 173 plies, other places are accesible by double deckers. That was even when SBS used to serve the Northwest areas. For services that cannot use double deckers, since the 10 min frequency rule is in place to control commuter crowds, operators will prefer to use single deckers.</p>

              <p>if the current fleet no one wants to maintain, no pt buying them. The fraying of articulator is getting worst, days back noted 1 Sv 188 bendy whole bottom articulator length fraying and touching road surface alrdy</p>
              <p>dun say profits. if really want to make more profit, should reguarly maintain the road to make sure it's roadworthy for 17 yrs tat long <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>They are really not interested in maintaining the bendies well, but it is not just the issue of maintainance as well. Bendies takes up a lot of space in depots, bus interchanges as well as bus lanes and bus bays, especially 2 to 3 bunch up together. And SMRT already has so many problems in parking spaces in depots, so I doubt they will bring in more to add their woes.</p>
