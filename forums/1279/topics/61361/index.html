Sv. 605 and Sv. 608 may be converted into TIBS services. Indeed CSS is really closing shop as quite a few TIBS staff have said.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I called SMRT and they told me that 603 is not making momey. I blasted them telling that many students take the service and many passengers takes it from Orchard Road to OG along Upp Cross Street. They seem unwilling to reinstate the service. I even told them that SMRT has some profitable routes like 190, 700 to "tiap" money for the unprofitable service. This pratice is done in SBS where others services "tiap" services like 11, 68 in order to better serve passengers as their promise in 1973 when it first started to "provide a better and improved services to passengers".<br><br>Maybe I write to SBS and see whether do they want to take up the offer as the service is vital to some places.</div>
