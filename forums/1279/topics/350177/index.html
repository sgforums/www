              <p>Ok, from what i hear.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Private Bus Drivers who work for touring companies earn more money. Plus, some of them can park their buses at heavy vehicle parks near to their home and use their buses as means of private usage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Private buses can also opt to park inside schools. (One B10M MK-IV PSV parks at Canberra Primary School)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you wanna be a public bus captain, you need to stick to perm routes and drive for 9 - 12 hrs daily. Do note that you only have 1 off day per week. They can opt for public holiday leave if the holiday is of religious nature (e.g Ching Ming or Thaipusam). Do note that these holiday leaves is thru bidding and you may fail to obtain the public holiday leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shift that would give a lower income would be standby. Standby BCs are BCs who would replace perm drivers if they are on leave or MC. They would be deployed to drive Chartered buses and so on. Do note that if the Standby driver is not assigned a duty on a particular day, the wage would be flat at $20 per day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Depots offer entertainment for BCs during swing breaks at depots. Depots have lounges that have computers (these computers have games in them that BCs can play), TVs and sofas. One particular depot is WLDEP.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Private Bus Drivers who work for touring companies earn more money. Plus, some of them can park their buses at heavy vehicle parks near to their home and use their buses as means of private usage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Private buses can also opt to park inside schools. (One B10M MK-IV PSV parks at Canberra Primary School)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you wanna be a public bus captain, you need to stick to perm routes and drive for 9 - 12 hrs daily. Do note that you only have 1 off day per week. They can opt for public holiday leave if the holiday is of religious nature (e.g Ching Ming or Thaipusam). Do note that these holiday leaves is thru bidding and you may fail to obtain the public holiday leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shift that would give a lower income would be standby. Standby BCs are BCs who would replace perm drivers if they are on leave or MC. They would be deployed to drive Chartered buses and so on. Do note that if the Standby driver is not assigned a duty on a particular day, the wage would be flat at $20 per day.</p>

              <p>1 off day per week? Lol...</p>
              <p>SMRT goes by 5-day work week. If the SLs choose to drive 1 more day = get more wages, as simple as that.</p>
              <p>If I'm not wrong the basic pay for both an SMRT and an SBST driver is the same, but the only difference is that SMRT goes by 5-day work week and SBST, 6-day work week. If you bother to calculate then, an SMRT driver who drives 6 days a week will obviously get more pay then an SBST driver who drives 6 days a week.</p>
              <p>Which is why there are so many ex-SBST BCs who jumped ship to SMRT to become SLs.</p>
