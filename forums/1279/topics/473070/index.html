              <p>Timings? If it is AM peak, Citaros will not be able to cater to the loading between Mayflower and Bencoolen. You need DDs for this part of the route. The loading drops after Bencoolen to Clementi. </p>

              113A should be extended to serangoon JC and should have more trips during AM peak.

              113A, by right should be AM peak
              113B should be PM peak.

              <p><br>Sorry no need to extend to Serangoon JC. If Lor Ah Soo or HG Ave 1 residents need to get to Serangoon JC, everyone in the right frame of mind, will prefer to take sv 62 that quickly takes them to the junction of Serangoon JC than laze around in 113 that will take significantly more time considering the loading / unloading at Kovan.</p>
              <p>Also 113 from Kovan to Hougang has barely even 10 pax on board especially if a 82, 107 have just gone ahead, which is the case many times. 113's route from Kovan to Hougang is completely redundant. It should ideally start from Serangoon Interchange and loop @ Kovan.</p>

                                      Sorry no need to extend to Serangoon JC. If Lor Ah Soo or HG Ave 1
                                      residents need to get to Serangoon JC, everyone in the right frame
                                      of mind, will prefer to take sv 62 that quickly takes them to the
                                      junction of Serangoon JC than laze around in 113 that will take
                                      significantly more time considering the loading / unloading at
                                      Kovan.</p>
                                      <p>Also 113 from Kovan to Hougang has barely even 10 pax on
                                      board especially if a 82, 107 have just gone ahead, which is the
                                      case many times. 113's route from Kovan to Hougang is completely
                                      redundant. It should ideally start from Serangoon Interchange and
                                      loop @ Kovan.</p>

                                      113's route from hougang is there for a reason. HG Ave 6 residents rely on this bus service to kovan or after kovan. How about schools students? Do you think sv 62 comes every 5 minutes? At hougang, 62 and 113 will come together to ensure that both buses are not packed. But at kovan, 113 is full of yuying secondary and xinghua primary students. If you get my point, that will be fantastic. Also, it serves as an alternative to punggol park rather than 119 when u have to walk to opp glad tidings church bus stop. In fact it's faster than sv 119. Even though u always see 10 pax from hg. Peak hours from hougang can be quite packed also.  107 does not serve the full hougang ave 10, hougang ave 8 and 6. On rainy days you should see the queue from HCI.  And, if you take 62 to serangoon JC junction, you have to walk 10 minutes! if you take 113, you just get off, get up the stairs to serangoon JC. 
                      
                      
                      I recommend 113 to loop at serangoon interchange instead of hougang street 11.. but once minton in hougang st 11 opens, there are 1000 units occupied so i think the loading of 113 will be even crowded. If the main road upper paya lebar road has a turn junction, it will be great if 113 serves hougang st 11 and serangoon interchange.

                  Would you prefer to have 1 svc to hougang or 2 bus svcs to hougang?
                  Walking to upper paya lebar road takes about 10 minutes. You think everyone can walk there?? What about the elderly? The bus stop is situated beside minton main gate, opp a child care ctr and in the centre of the major hdb blocks in hougang st 11. There were many suggestions made to extend 113 to serangoon but it was rejected. It was rejected for a reason. Same for 113's merge with 119. It was approved by PTC but not implemented. 53 from serangoon and 113 from kovan are cashcows.. From serangoon to lorong ah soo only 4 bus stops.. while kovan to lorong ah soo takes about 7-8 bus stops.. SBST of course want to earn more la.. Thats why they purposely adjust the freq to 15-20minutes.. they wan people to squeeze and they make the 113A BCs go round and round to save resources. Nevertheless, the north-east line crowd prefer to take 113 from kovan and the ccl crowd prefer to take 53 from CCL. As for 45, seldom full from serangoon station because of it's long frequency and no SWT. Hougang street 21 can be a huge problem because of its huge load. Nowadays pax are filled to the front door from kovan station and when it reaches hougang st 21 only 4-5 pax can board, with 20 passengers struggling to board 113. Then how about the next bus stop at blk 210?? I took 113 yesterday after a 20 minute wait. When the bus came, everyone seem to be running towards the entrance of the bus, like as if they dont run machiam cannot board like that. I queued to get up but was pushed by several office workers and aunties/uncles. They are all snatching for a seat. IDK the hougang south interchange was demolished. If it wasnt demolished, there will be proper berths for these inconsiderate people to queue and wait for the next bus in line. 113's problem at kovan is with all these people. When people cannot board, the next bus is a 15 min wait away and the crowd is again accumulated. Sometimes 113A dosent even appear, idk BC is eating snake or what. Sometimes off svc at 7.30PM and go back to HCI. Sometimes 8PM still have. As for 53, there is 53B right behind if a packed 53 comes. So as for 53, not for chaotic as they are taking for only 4 stops. And last time minton was HDB estate, 113 had dds in the past to serve the huge load taking from the minton bus stop. Last time 113 was ex-321. 2 vo2x i presume. You may say 113A will come together with 113. Sometimes you are lucky, yes. But most of the time, no. There are people who say people dont move to the back. They moved to the back and there were 2 rows of people standing at the rear already.. If 113 had 2 or 3 more buses i think this will be greatly improved.. no need for dds.. but as for the students.. i think all of them will climb up to the upper deck and spam the bus stopping bell. Especially pri sch kids who utilise this bus svc very often.

              <p><br>If you feel so strongly about it write ALL this to LTA / SBST. The last time you  wrote their response was "No DD or extra buses needed" as capacity is managed. If there is a need, why will they not add buses? Why won't they put DD like they have done to so many other service? Why no crossover? Easily crossover can be arranged from buses in HCI that come from CBD like 107, 153. Instead of going off-service, they can do 113A and then go to depot, just like 139A has 3 buses in evening crossover from sv 90. What is the reason that only you find the loading so high and LTA/SBS does not? The way you have described seems like 113 loading is even higher than sv 88.</p>

                      other service? Why no crossover? Easily crossover can be arranged
                      from buses in HCI that come from CBD like 107, 153. Instead of
                      going off-service, they can do 113A and then go to depot, just like
                      139A has 3 buses in evening crossover from sv 90. What is the
                      reason that only you find the loading so high and LTA/SBS does not?
                      The way you have described seems like 113 loading is even higher
                      than sv 88.</p>

              <p><br> What im emphasising on is on the number of buses used on this. Sv 88 has a higher loading than 113 but 88 has improved, with more trips and buses. But 113, no. No improvements. I think 27 can crossover to do 2 trips of 113 before going back to depot. Or 115 bc can just switch desto plate to 113A and start from hg st 21 instead of going back to the depot at 6.15PM. I have a sv 119 bc fren and he told me all bcs will purposely stop far far away from 113 at kovan station as the loading takes about 5minutes. What does this prove?</p>

              <p>119 has more buses than 113.. and its very empty during peak hours.. Compared to 7 buses.. packed like sardines. SBST can deny the loading is adequate, but i am sure photos dont lie.</p>

              <p>LTA reply was :</p>
              <p>At around 7pm, there was a surge of above 85% in the peak hour loading of bus sv 113. We have forwarded this to SBS Transit and will implement the neccessary measures if needed.</p>

              <p>Bro, I agree with you that the loading on sv 113 is very high from Kovan to Lor Ah Soo, more so from Kovan to HG Ave 1. My point is when you say put DDs on this service, it is not possible to do so because the route from Kovan to Hougang is completely redundant. In peak hours, I have spotted the bus with just 10 pax, and yes there are times when it has 30-40 pax but not more.</p>
              <p>Hence, justifying DDs for this route is not fair. What SBST can do is crossover DDs rom 107, 153 to sv 113A during evening peak.</p>
              <p>If you want 113 to have perm DDs, then the route needs to be modified to ply Serangoon Int loop @ Kovan and DDs will have around 80-90 pax loading from Serangoon and even from Kovan. Also, do not need 53A and 53B once this change is made.</p>

              <p>not perm dds, but more buses. Crossover dds would be ideal because commuters taking from kovan station will move up due to the heavy loading and it takes more than 15 mins to reach their destination.. and once minton's built i bet everyone will move up. 119 dds should perm 113 instead. I dont think the punggol bto flat residents will utilise this svc since there is svc 50 that brings them to AMK and it's just a 10 mins walk to punggol MRT station..</p>

              <p>I meant walking from punggol field to punggol mrt takes only 10 mins. Plus the 119's bus stop and svc 50 bus stop are only 100-200m away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I meant, no perm dds required but if 119 dds perm 113 then it will be ideal. That's what i meant. The DDs can sooth the peak hour load greatly. 107 and 153 dds can crossover to 113A or 113 for 1 trip.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please evaluate the use of implementing on dds on 119?</p>
              <p>Peak hour no people take.. only few pax</p>
              <p>Sch students maybe.. but will not get the whole bus full. Maybe once in a blue moon nowadays.. ppl prefer to take 136 instead. Whats the use of extending 119 to punggol anyways? still deploy 2 perm dds</p>
