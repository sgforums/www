Both svcs are packed for time and the BCs are understandeably less inclined to pick you up. For both svcs it is common practice to alternate bus-stops whenever 2 come together. In fact the one tighter for time is likely to skip bus-stop whether it is in front or at the back.<br><br>If you wanna take tridents, if you have time to spare, try waiting for 1. It won't take very long cos 89 has the largest fleet on tridents with 6.<br><br>Technically of course, the trident is obliged to pick you up.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You were going short joy-ride again?<br><br></div>

Feeling lan-lan, I went back to the 87, but the 87 driver refused to open the front door because the bus was full. So in the end I missed 2 buses... Luckily, minutes later I was "rescued" by an empty 17A... When the 17A turned into Bedok Interchange, I saw the 60 leaving the interchange, and I gave an angry stare to the 60 driver... (At least I'm courteous enough not to show my middle finger) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Your case Sv60 BC should stop for you as you may be going towards Eunos or Bedok Rsvr and Sv87 ENDS at Bedok Int.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not wrong for you to choose buses. But it's better not to be too choosy about the buses next time if there is only one buses of their individual services arriving at the bus stop.<br><br>When you went over to the back to take SBS 9682Z, a DT, the BC ordered you to go to the front to take. But if the front bus (SBS 9208K) got away when you tried to attract the attention of the BC on SBS 9208K, it's better to get onto the DT and still have time to reach to your destination.<br><br>What do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually, I will try to take CAC Volvos, even if it means transferring like 7 buses to get home instead of the usual 2 or 3. If there are 2 buses, usually the BC will let me board coz as you know, it is possible for 3 30s to come at once - 1 super late, 1 on time, 1 super early.</div>
