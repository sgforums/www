              <p>You know those so called cross borders/Coaches/Private bus drivers are more skillful and experienced cause they truly own a class 4 and bus VL unlike our city bus drivers which 85% only owns class 3.I realised this when I myself go and take class 4 and bus VL and working as an Night Rider SL,Driver of a PA Toyota Coaster and airport buses and ocassionally drive workers to factory.Furthermore the buses that can speed usually are manual transmission </p>

              <p>To 'bus555' and 'lemon1974', can I add some details to this list? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"><br><br>Cause IIRC 260S came over from 53, forgot replacing which other SD but it came to 21 for a short while before going out to SP again. </p>
              <p>The Mk4 fleet of 21 used to consist of these buses at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">varying times</span>: <strong>985J 986G 987D 1972P 2625K 2627E 2629A 2745Y 2790R. </strong><br><strong><br>985J to 987D</strong> were perm 21 together before 2005, then 985J left for Sv 7 when 7 came under BN control? 986G used to have the Total Defence Day ad IIRC, 987D was the Fish &amp; Co or some camera ad IIRC. Then somehow or rather 986G went to Sv 7 as well to find 985J. Left 987D stuck in AM 21 still.</p>
              <p><strong>2790R</strong> got kicked out from Sv 21 can't remember why, but IIRC it was for some O405?Paiseh uh this part pre-2005 before I started the hobby, so not sure why 2790R left.</p>
              <p>Then the 3 Striders of <strong>2625K 2627E 2629A</strong> were perm 21 together in the same period, but I remembered 2625K 2627E were BN 21, 2629A was AM 21. Different depots. Then 2627E crashed into the back of 9417Z (which was still on BN 65 back then) at the last stop of Bedok Reservoir to St. Mikes there, MIA for a long time and 1972P (which was BN SP then) came into BN 21 as 2627E's replacement.</p>
              <p>So subsequently when 2627E came out from its repair/lay-up period, it went to 196 instead till today.</p>
              <p>Uh yes, the VO3xs of 21 back then. I used to take 9304R on 21 everyday in the morning to my sec sch in Tampines from PSR. And it would always bunch with 9485B on Sv 12 (which it was still perm back then) and the two BCs would always do a drag race from the junctions from Loyang Ave to Tampines Ave 7. And 9304R always won, HOHO.</p>
              <p><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">9210C 9304R 9313P 9370Z 9434Z 9524Y 9622Y</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> were AM 21 all along while perm. <br></span><strong style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">9462S 9491H 9522C</strong><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> were BN 21 IIRC.<br><strong>9435X</strong> was unique, cause like the Striders, this bus jumped depots. Used to be BN 21, then jumped to AM 21 before it got kicked out to BN 14 (jump depot again) when the CDGE B9s came.<br><strong>9458E</strong> was under AMDEP 21 before it got kicked out. And when it left, it went to BN 168, cross-depot also.</span></p>
              <p>Other VO3xs that were perm AM 21 before. <strong>9423E then 9417Z.</strong> 9423E had the characteristic slip-gear that wasn't fixed for a long long time. But both got kicked out to AM 25 when BN 21 got the 2 CDGE B9 duties (prior to this only AM 21 had the CDGEs). <strong>9449G</strong> was also perm AM 21 before IIRC, but got replaced by 3778X between Sv 21-56 swap?</p>
              <p>Hope this update is good! I might miss out a few details here &amp; there with the regos &amp; their ads, but I think this is accurate as of my memory all these 7 years! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>history lesson ah...</p>
              <p>Before 3 Oct 2004</p>
              <p>AM: 985 986 987 2789 2790 9144 9811 9812 9813 9814<br>BN: 2625 2627 2629 2745 9210 9304 9370 9434 9435 9458 9462 9491 9522</p>
              <p>Size: 10 + 13 (23)</p>
              <p>then came the shift in depot control: Xfer 8 bus control from BN to AM. <br>2789 went 156, 9144 went 72, 9813 9814 went 9 and 65 respectively <br>2629 2745 9210 9304 followed the service to amdep<br>382 came from 103, 9313 9524 came from 30, 9622 came from 86</p>
              <p>Before 5 Sep 2005</p>

              <p>Size: 18 + 5 (23)</p>
              <p>then another round of redeployments due to Bedok Int going full bndep control: </p>
              <p>985 986 went to BN 7 (xfer control from HG 7 to BN 7), replaced by spare merc from amdep</p>
              <p>End 2005, sv 21 fleet</p>
              <p>AM: <strong>138</strong> 382 <strong>573</strong> 987 2629 2745 2790 9210 9304 9313 9370 9434 9435 9458 9524 9622 9811 9812<br>BN: 2625 2627 9462 9491 9522<br><br>Size: 18 + 5 (23)</p>
              <p>Between end 2005 and May 2006, 2790 went 166, 138 went to be drug bus. Spare buses replaced them on 21. 2627 went to the workshop and came back out perming 109 (with 2815 2834).</p>
              <p>By May 2006: the fleet is:</p>

              <p>Size: 18 + 5 (23)</p>
              <p>WAB starts to invade 21. Fleet had major change from 27 June 2006</p>

              <p>Woooh, thanks really for the comprehensive list to plug the gaps I had in my memory of Sv 21! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> I missed out all the MB O405s, cause they were like constantly switching the O405s whenever the lifespan expiry date loomed. <br><br>I think you missed out some buses though. 8247D came to Sv 21 also along with 8280G 8289H 8290C. Then the mahjong occured because they swapped 8247D for its sibling 8248B later on (like you had mentioned above), then let 8247D go to SP. Then later on 8247D went TRG instead before it went to BR 145.</p>
              <p>8290C went 131 direct swap for 8470A to 21, then 8470A crashed on 21 so 8292Y came to 21 instead from 72 for direct swap uh. The intermediate was 8470A that is still MIA.</p>

              <p>Were you asking if it was a demostrator? Nahs it wasn't. The demo was 8033D, and even then it was only a demo for the bodywork &amp; seat arrangements, not like 1688K or 2888T. The order of 8033D was along with all the KUBs SBST had placed back then IIRC. </p>

              <p>Last time when SBS6010H cameoed on 410W during pm peak, it was late for a minute. The whole queue took about 5 minutes to clear off the whole pax and there was still about 20 - 30 pax which cannot board the bus. 2 minutes later, 5153K came and that bus was also very packed. Then 1 old lady stand outside ask the BC alot of redundant questions, letting the queue stuck there for very long. In the end, the whole thing wasn't even cleared even 8538P came 3 minutes later. I did not know what happened after as I boarded 8399Z on 56. The best is to deploy only 1 DD during spilt shift periods.</p>
