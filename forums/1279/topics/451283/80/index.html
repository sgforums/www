              <p>Has anyone wondered about the optimal number of feeder bus services that each residential town should have, irregardless of the size of the town?</p>
              <p>Many lobbyists seem to expect the number of feeder services/residential town that are comparable to that in Woodlands/Yishun (8 feeders/Townlinks/Intra-Towns, which I feel may be a tad too many) based on several comments here, even though I understand that they will be needed for upcoming residential developments and expansions.</p>
              <p>I feel that having too many feeder services per residential town isn't the most efficient way to go in bus route planning for a residential town, though it would perfectly fit the existing hub-and-spoke system in Singapore.</p>
              <p>More inter-town trunk services will certainly work better and open up greater accessibility options for residents in more secluded neighbourhoods, rather than just a feeder bus connection to the bus interchange/MRT station in the town/regional centre. Having more inter-town trunk services can also aid in diverting part of the passenger demand away from these more secluded neighbourhoods in a residential town, which could potentially aid in alleviating the crowds in the bus interchange/MRT station.</p>

              <p>I don't think number is important. They need to serve a particular need. For instance, I absolutely support launch of 382 and 386. I do not support launch of 324 as that could have been covered with service 102. It is a waste of resource there!</p>
              <p>Likewise I support launch of 63M and 139M but do not support launch of 53M or 143M (as these supplementary services act like feeders). 43M IMO should have been a NEX -&gt; Buangkok MRT loop service. The part from Buangkok to Punggol is empty on most buses.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs3004X, 100% not possible. Expansion of sengkang interchange is not to cater for sbs 43M. It is totally not in the plans. Moreover, sbs 43 is going over to go ahead Group Singapore in Q3 2016. 43M is very good that it starts from Punggol as it helps to bring residents from Punggol mrt to soo teck LRT. This point is solely missed by many forumers when people keep thinking that it should start from serangoon and stop at buangkok. In future, sbs 43M will serve an extra pair of bus stops along sengkang east road where on 1 side, some HDB flats along compassvale street are completed and on the other side, the Vale condominium is currently being built. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, not only just 1 factor la. There are other factors like soon-to-be-built new bus stop along sengkang east road (opposite compassvale street HDB flats and opposite vale condo). How? Did you consider that? How about soo teck LRT bus stop to sengkang east road (sengkang polyclinic) connection? It is more important to provide all these little connections. This is not covered by 117/118/LRT. Since you stay in sengkang, you should know that sengkang east road next to TPE is not yet connected. </p>
              <p>Also do note that when sbs 43M was implemented long time back, the only connection was sbs 43 from Punggol interchange to soo teck LRT. Sbs 117/118 were not even introduced yet. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Yes there was only 43 from Punggol to Soo Teck when 43M was launched, and that may be the reason why 43M started from Punggol at that time. But that's probably not the situation now.</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, you forget about the connection in between Punggol central to buangkok. At many stops along here, sbs 43M is also providing the link. Sbs 117/118 do not provide this link. LTA is definitely right in starting sbs 43M at Punggol interchange. Even if GCM takes over, it is also right that Go ahead group starts sbs 43M at Punggol interchange. </p>
              <p>At the queue in interchange itself, many people board sbs 43 or 43M depending on which comes first. This shows that their journey is only maximum up to serangoon central. This also goes to show the impact that 43M has on 43.</p>
              <p>Your scenario of fleet addition and capacity upgrades on 43 will shorten 43M will not materialize. In fact, it may even pump up sbs 43M. For your info, the fleet addition and capacity upgrades of sbs 43M will definitely be offset by the more than 4000 units of HDB flats all around soo teck LRT and even partially offset by some further up near sumang LRT. Moreover, there are also more than 1000 units of flats around compassvale crescent next to sengkang east road which is on sbs 43M route. There may be 1 pair of new bus stops along sengkang east road. Just tell me do all these residents here need sbs 43M? If it starts from sengkang/buangkok, it will miss out so many residents. Thus I feel it is unlikely for sbs 43M to start from sengkang/buangkok. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Of course, we understand that the people working to keep us moving are doing their best. We appreciate their hard work.... which is why I suggest creating a new bus service and reducing the frequency of 179, because running a bus service at an extremely high frequency is very hard and easily prone to bus brunching problems.... furthermore, Pioneer Road North is always jam during weekday morning peak hours...</p>
