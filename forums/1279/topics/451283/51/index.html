              <p>I think you are right. The other Scanias I have taken all have the grey screws... BTW, <strong>SBS8439S</strong> (BBDEP 160, took it when still HGDEP 27 with SPAD stickers) has a lock on one of the black tabs (that open the covers to reveal the door mechanisms) each at the front and exit doors. Could this indicate that it was assembled by <strong>SC Auto</strong>?</p>

              <p>I apologise should the following question makes people feel something out of me as I may have repeated this a few times, but I wished for someone to fully clarify confusions about the impending replacements of MK4s...</p>
              <p>MK4s (regardless of which bodywork) are due to go most likely starting from this August, after all most of the earlier DMs have been put to spare...while there are more than 300+ MK4s remaining on the roads, there are only 190 Citaros left to be registered and most probably a fraction of it are still for BSEP.</p>
              <p>I am thinking that it seems like a large number of MK4s are in excess that they may be going for early retirement, unless SBS Transit may want to give them a few months to two years of lifespan extensions, and even those that have already been extended for two years may receive another six months to one year to their maximum lifespans like the later batches of Volvo Olympians...does anyone has anything to express about it?</p>

                              replacements of MK4s...</p>
              <p>MK4s (regardless of which bodywork) are due to go most likely
                              starting from this August, after all most of the earlier DMs have
                              been put to spare...while there are more than 300+ MK4s remaining
                              on the roads, there are only 190 Citaros left to be registered and
                              most probably a fraction of it are still for BSEP.</p>
              <p>I am thinking that it seems like a large number of MK4s are in
                              excess that they may be going for early retirement, unless SBS
                              Transit may want to give them a few months to two years of lifespan
                              extensions, and even those that have already been extended for two
                              years may receive another six months to one year to their maximum
                              lifespans like the later batches of Volvo Olympians...does anyone
                              has anything to express about it?</p>

              <p>Buses that are already extended for 2 years are unlikely to be granted any further extension unless the operator can prove that there is a shortfall of resources due to factors beyond its control.</p>
              <p>Buses that have reached 17 years of age are normally granted extension for up to 2 years provided they are maintained to a satisfactory standard (and if you are experienced and observant, you should be able to deduce what this standard is).</p>

              <p>I don't think this shortfall of resources apply to the Volvo Olympians...after all they are the oldest DDs on the roads currently and even with so many Wrights, some of them are still being extended for a total of 3 years lifespan extensions (first 2 years in 2012, then the second 1 year earlier in March). It is for some obvious reasons that SBS Transit chose not to place Wrights on JIS.</p>
              <p>I agree that buses that are maintained well will be given lifespan extensions, but that is just one deciding factor. I am just trying to figure out whether the 360+ MK4s will just be laid up and de-registered starting from a few months later with excess buses as upgrades/replacements.</p>

              <p>2. I would choose the former, but for the case of SBS Transit it is different.

              <p>1. how do u define JIS? obviously 182/192/193 are also serving jurong industrial area... if u have noticed, JIS are the dumping ground for all old buses..... not that SBST dont want to deploy wright on them, they have priority to deploy wrights on other major trunk service first...</p>
              <p>2. apparently when SBST make the previous purchase of 550 citaros, all the MK4 replacement are accounted for.. However, due to the BSEP program, there will be shortage and thus, most likely DM3500 will be extended....</p>
              <p>3. further right now it is not just 1 to 1 replacement... lots of services are getting dd upgrade and further sbst have committed to get some new buses as well (part of 250 new buses)... so it is not as simple as u see.... just left it to SBST staff to do their work when the time come... when the buses are suppose to be gone, they will just gone and no one will remember them....</p>

              <p>Some people define JIS as all services serving Jurong Industrial area while others define it as a common group of services introduced back in 1970s - the later 24x and 25x series. For me at this point of time I define it as the latter. I still remembered back in 2013 when you argued with someone about the poor treatment of JIS as compared to 182 and 192 and even the definition of JIS. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">As to whether SBS Transit wants to deploy Wrights on them it is a different story. I did not mention the exact reason for them not doing so, after all Wrights can be deployed on any service for different reasons, i.e. to increase the WAB quota, fleet replacement, etc.</span></p>
              <p>The last two parts I do agree with you, in fact I know about this well...the trends back in 2012-2013 had proved the points that the buses purchased are not for direct replacements due to BSEP, and even SDs were upgraded to DDs as a result. I will simply rest my case for the last issue.</p>

              <p>Can use SP Citaros or non-BSEP DD buses in the case of rare situations. Each depot can keep 2 SP BSEP WEGs, more than that is a waste. BSEP buses are to be meant on roads, not in depots. This way LTA can bring in 50 more buses to increase its count and keep them SP.</p>
