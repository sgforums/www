              <p>Why not?</p>
              <p>If no one boards at these stops then the stops would be
              skipped.</p>
              <p>If the bus do have to stop then it means that there are people
              using the bus stops.</p>
              <p>Either way the bus stops would not cost you time for
              nothing.</p>
              <p>In fact I must admit it's a good thing 72 plied Tampines Rd
              becoz the traffic on the TPE is severely high during peak (actually
              ALWAYS higher if compared to Old Tampines Rd), and the slip
              entrance to TPE (SLE) at Api Api flyover is horribly jammed, all
              day, everyday.</p>
              <p>And since LTA had the bus stops there I don't see the reason to
              abandon them or take them down. My 72 flew past them while
              overspeeding and sometimes thos<span style="line-height: 1.231;">e
              at the </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">a</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">irbase has around 5-7 ppl boarding
              there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">So... Yeah doesn't make sense
              but since the stops are already there it makes even less sense to
              abandon or remove them.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Just to add on</p>
              <p>There used to be houses between KPE and Paya Lebar Airbase. The ones near Api Api Flyover are for the temples and industrial areas. The rest are probably leftovers from the 70s/80s.</p>
              <p>Fun fact,  81 used to ply it way back when it terminates at Loyang Estate in its original route in in the 70s. 53 also uses it when first extended to Changi. Both was ammended to TPE when Elias Flyover was demolished.</p>
              <p>Question, where is the loading for 531, and what time? Everytime I see 531, ere is always no one in the bus.</p>

              <p>There is one KUB that does down route after turning left from cte. It is mostly meant for pax along ave 10 to get to Bishan MRT as an alternate option to AMK MRT. Also direct connection to CCL. </p>

              <p>It is v poor ploanning to have such a small interchange in an area like Serangoon. There is scope to introduce many services from this highly populated and quite central estate. Also, no other interchange closeby. Next closest interchange is Hougang, which is also already crowded.</p>
              <p>Maybe with Bidadari coming up, we can expect an interchange in Woodleigh in future? Even Buangkok Interchange - no sign yet of when it will call for tenders and when it will be in effect.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I doubt it is poor planning for serangoon interchange. Most of the interchanges built are about similar in sizes. I think at that time when it was built, the emphasis is on mrt as the no 1 public transport in Singapore and buses are just to supplement it. In yr 2009/2010, there is absolutely no mention of BSEP. They never intend to introduce many bus services all over Singapore. Thus the serangoon interchange is of right size. It is only after Singapore residents start to complain of insufficient flats, poor transport system in yr 2011 and after the general election 2011, then everything changes.</p>
              <p>Lands are tendered, flats are built fast amid the sudden increase in population and these buses are needed to fill the void. Buses are bought and bus services are then introduced and depots are built. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Ok. But need more interchanges now on NEL side. Don't see any updates on that front. Serangoon no space, HG no space, sengkang/punggol may have but are at extreme end. Kovan express terminal should be converted into bus interchange again with allowing buses to turn right and left. Then can introduce more services for NEL area. </p>

              <p>Yes Buangkok coming up... But still no news on when... Till then Serangoon and HG cannot manage. Sengkang can get one more service... I think this one will be reserved for HdB hubs around Fernvale Lane, Sengkang west way, anchorvale crescent... Sv 373..  HG might accommodate one more service.</p>
              <p>thats about it. Until Buangkok comes up in 2017/2018... What is LTA going to do? They will have to think about services starting from HGDEP then... </p>

              <p>Wonder why MB &amp; <span>VDL</span> doesnt produce 3
              axles DD for HK &amp; Singapore markets?<br> MB can easily produce Citaro DD with its Euro VI 10700cc 350hp and
              <span>VDL DB</span> can use <span>IPT</span> cursor 9000cc engine with 360hp..Can give Volvo and <span>ADL</span> a run for its money</p>

              <p>For MB it may take some time before they can produce the 3 axle Citaro DD, since they haven't produced a DD chassis in a long time, the last DD that they ever made was the S80 (S80 was the name used for the O405 prototypes) which isn't a success.</p>
              <p>For VDL I think it would have to depend on the success of the KMB 2 axle DB300 demonstrator unit. From there it gives them an option to expand on the double deck lineage for the HK and SG markets. Engine wise I think they will be better off with the DAF PACCAR PR 265 (360hp) 9.2L engine or even the more popular Cummins ISL8.9E5 340B engine.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>If its using Cummins then SMRT should buy it cause share same engine with the E500s..Cummins engines is so popular in Sg,Even most China buses using it.If this happens SBST would buy the MB Citaro DD and SMRT buy the VDL</div>

              <p>By the way The Enviro 500 is rated at 340hp not 335hp as stated
                  by sgwiki..</p>

              <p>Actually it can be 335hp or 340hp. This is because the person who edited that wiki page simply converted 250kw to hp. But not many people know that there is 2 types of horsepower (Metric units and UK/Imperial units). 250kw = 339.90538122 hp/PS (Metric) = 335.25546466 hp (UK/Imperial).</p>
              <p>PS stands for horsepower in German.</p>
              <p>A website to help convert (don't convert using Google, it gives the imperial units)</p>

              ps usually smaller than hp ie:102ps is about 100hp
              For US they love to use ft/lb for torque and we usually use nm.
              
              My 1.6 MPV turbo is 140ps/205nm
              My 600cc bike is rated at 80hp/59nm wakaka
