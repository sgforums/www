            <div class='col-md body'>Appreciate your concern for quality content in this forum !<br><br>I'm also a person who believes only in quality discussion..not only in this forum but almost any other forum as well !<br><br>But, i also believe there's a certain need for tolerance, due to the potentially vastly different levels of human maturity, educational &amp; professional experiences etc. who would utimately be reflected in the quality of the posts made by an individual !! Don't reasonably expect e.g. some inexperienced, lowly educated, young futs like some types of students from writing &amp; thinking to the same standards as say some professional CEO grade of individual of a few million $ net worth etc.<br><br>I believe this forum should as far as practically possible, be opened to almost anyone anywhere for them to have their thoughts on buses &amp; coaches 'aired' to the world @ large.<br><br>With such an approach, there's always of course the increased risks of 'misuse' by some individuals, resulting in sub-standard quality content being posted from them. This negative side of the coin must however be weighted to the other positive side of the coin, in which by having the forum opened to almost anyone anywhere interested enough to visit it in the 1st place, that in itself ensures maximum effect in gaining publicity so as to also maximise the chances of getting even more people actively interested in buses &amp; coaches !<br><br>The problem of having 'closed' &amp; private forums i find is that not many people would know of its existence in the 1st place &amp; most unfortunately, that automatically shuts out individuals with quality content to offer from being able to benefit or least enable others from benefitting from their expertise ! That'll be indeed a most great loss !!!! One has to wait to be 'discovered' 1 day by someone else before being 'refered' to join such forums would be a most unneccesary delay to getting started ! Noone really benefits in such delays. Just waste of time &amp; opportunities !<br><br>In conclusion, the gist of my message here is that one should as far as tolerably possible, learn to be tolerant of others such as those who appear less competent in delivering quality content to this forum &amp; as such, learn to learn to know how to seperate the 'gems' from the rubbish &amp; as such simply mentally ignore or shut-out such individuals by ignoring their posts &amp; focusing only on content from others who meet one's personally required quality standards !<br>Different people have different 'standards' of expectation, so determine your's &amp; stick to it &amp; only entertain when you encounter a post of your standard while ignoring all the rest !! That's my style when i use any forum, so therefore i hardly am bothered with 'lousy' posts from some others because i've somewhat developed 'immunity' to them &amp; 'see-through' them almost literally as if they don't exist ! Then no problems.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by ^tamago^:<br>[b]Dear forumnites, it's time to wake up and sober up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I quite agree with your observations. These denote the present situation in much of the world outside (developed) Europe, quite unfortunately !<br><br>But frankly i seriously do find quite some 'unchartered territory' in both Singapore &amp; Malaysia, say the least, whereby lies the potential to further instill &amp; grow a more personal &amp; deeper sense of interest (by the typical commutor on the street) into the bus or coach as being much more than merely a means of transport from A to B i.e. to get them to view such vehicles as some collective extention of the car, motorcycle or bicycle !<br><br>True there's more individual owners (&amp; users) of cars then buses but look @ warships, tanks &amp; aircraft. These have very few individual owners &amp; users yet many it seems have 'mad interest' in these things. I however, am hardly interested in any of these !! Simply because i don't make much use of them in my own daily life &amp; therefore don't see much relevance as such, to my personal daily routine &amp; life overall ! Maybe if i worked in an industry dealing with such equipment i might then become more interested in them. But buses &amp; coaches, many people do use them now &amp; then if not daily, whether or not they already have a car. So therein lies the potential to further instill &amp; develop an individual's interest in them !<br><br>What i'll call 'bus culture' is highly alive in (developed) Europe especially Germany &amp; not surprisingly therefore, that's also where you get innovative original 1st party coach designs which come integrally constructed CBU or CKD (just like the cars or vans) designs which are 'approved' by the same maker of the bus-chassi ! Famous designs e.g. over the years like the Kassbohrer Setras, M-B O 303, O 404 &amp; more recently the Travego.<br><br>I find it unfortunate however that what i'll call bus &amp; coach piracy is rampant in Asia even like in Singapore &amp; Malaysia whereby you find 3rd party bus &amp; coach body makers 'steal' M-B original designs like the O 404 or Travego either in whole or in substantial part to incorporate into their 'own' 'rojak' designs of bodies here which end up on non M-B bus-chassi like MAN, Hino etc. which really has no business to be used in such manner ! The overall quality perception doesn't measure up to the real original ones from Europe but due to the presently low level of interest of many a typical bus or coach commutor even the operators i believe ! here in buses &amp; coaches other than 'strictly' as transport tools, the operators &amp; these local body makers don't seem to find much incentive to jack up the quality of their works to the original real standards like in (developed) Europe as such.<br><br>But if there's keener sense of personal interest in bus &amp; coaches per se going beyond merely being transport vehicles from A to B in future in this end of the world, then i expect more of what i call 'original bus culture' to develop in this region, cumulating ultimately (that's my distant objective to achieve) in some production arrangement between 1st party bus &amp; coach makers sub-conning their original bus &amp; coach body designs to 3rd party body makers outside (who meet the original makers quality standards) to make &amp; assemble CBU the complete bus or coach down to the finest detail in exact compliance to standards to those produced CBU in say Germany by the 1st party makers !<br><br>In other words, same standards like in the cars or vans.<br>That means e.g. an M-B Travego coach produced here must be the same standard as those produced in Germany or Spain etc. Presently the production quality of a Vito van say tends to be similar whether if produced in Spain or Portugal or even Germany. Likewise for the cars whereby whether produced in CKD form from Malaysia, South Africa, India or Germany etc., the standards are overall consistent enough for one to know it's the 'real thing', not some rojak pirated work like in the bus &amp; coach sectors here presently.<br><br>Therefore, i still see much potential for improvement in the bus &amp; coach industries in this region. Of course, the bottom line pre-requisite for such improvements would chiefly depend on the $ issue i.e. how much people here are willing to pay to take a bus or coach ! I do firmly believe that when people here have developed sufficient deep interest in the buses &amp; coaches they personally use, they'll not mind paying some extra $ to get the superior original quality edge in the form of 1st party buses &amp; coaches ! And when the 3rd party local body makers are ready &amp; joint-venture with the 1st party makers to get the licensing rights to build such class of vehicles, then i'll still tend to be a win-win situation for all parties, whether it be commutor, operator, local 3rd party sub-contractor or original 1st party maker of the bus-chassi &amp; body !!<br><br>I'm most looking forward to such a state of affairs in the future.<br>I may not know when it would happen, but i'm 'instinctively' confident that things should &amp; would progress in such a direction !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 105090:</div><div class="quote_body">i daresay more people own cars than buses, and buses may not wow thw whole population to an extent.. talk about ferraris etc.. still, i have to agree with you..<br>many people talk bout cars but they dont own one at all.. buses and trains most people relies on to bring them to work or home..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
