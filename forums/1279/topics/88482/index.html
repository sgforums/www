Hello....i dun see any difference xcept whacking the dust up and allow it to settle it down again and pissing off the other person on the seat<br><br>Some damn heavy, big size pple occupying the outer seats when inner seat is empty. Esp visible on habits, cos of the cantilever seat supports. Once saw the entire seat tilted downwards, and worse of all, obstructing seat space<br><br>Some old uncles blasting some chinese opera music on those stereos to compete with the TV Mobile<br><br>Old aunties that come running after the bus had started moving out of the bus bay and expect the bus to stop for them, and im in a big hurry.<br><br>Some people of a particular ethnic race that piss me off when i esp wait for the next bus so i can grab the best seat and then they flash an apologetic smile and then the whole family of 6-8 comes into the queue. If I try to cut them ( ive the right of way cos i queued for a longer time ), the worse thing is that they would start accusing me of cutting queue. Esp prevalent at the svc 969 berth in Tampines, and always come into play when theres a nice volgren bendy waiting to depart. Rated the most highly on my hate list.</div>
