              <p>Oh yeah 854 WAB quota fucked up again . Last week 854 has 9
              Bendies and 6 DD the rest are SD . Previous week was 3-4 Bendies
              and 8-10 DD . </p>
              <p>Previous week - 80-88% WAB buses </p>
              <p>Last week  - 65-69% WAB buses </p>
              <p>Is this a trend where they increase WAB buses this week and then
              decrease it next week and then bring it back up the following week

              <p>But the current quota you observed is still acceptable, and reaches the LTA minimum requirement of 60%, so I would'nt say its f-ed up.</p>
              <p>On the other hand quite a number of feeders like 903, 913 are struggling to even hit the 60% quota, with many occasions even below a 50% WAB fleet.</p>

              <p>Bedok North st 2 not eligible for buses from what I have heard. Maxwell could easily have has 1-2 services ply. </p>
              <p>In addition, there are lot of roads within industrial estates that do not have a bus service.</p>
              <p>Also Haig road, Tanah Merah Kechill Road, Bayshore and Meyer road close to Mountbatten do not have full day bus service. Meyer &amp; Bayshore has few premium services &amp; shuttle</p>

              <p>Loyang Dr, Loyang Lane, Loyang Way (between PSR Dr 3 and Loyang Lane) - Maybe a new service from Changi Villege / LYDEP will do.</p>
              <p>Flora Dr - Easiest way is to amend 37, but transfers to svc 2/5 will be lost.</p>
              <p>Tampines St 42/44 - Unlikely to be covered in near future.</p>
              <p>Tampines St 85/86 - Probably the upcoming Tampines feeder.</p>
              <p>Tampines St 92/93/94 - Used to be served by 68, but since it was withdrawn, there's probably insufficient demand even for a peak-hour service.</p>
              <p>Somapah Rd, Changi South Ave 1/3 - Maybe a new service from Changi Business Park Ter will serve SUTD.</p>
              <p>Kaki Bukit Ave 2, Rd 3, Ave 3 - Maybe will have new service when DTL3 opens.</p>
              <p>Ubi Ave 2, Rd 1/3 - Rumoured 137 from Sims Place to Ubi.</p>
              <p>Haig Rd - Could easily divert one service from Tg Katong Rd but apparently LTA doesn't want to do so.</p>
              <p>Stadium Dr - Bus stops were built but no service. Once I thought 16 will be diverted back to Sports Hub but now it seems unlikely.</p>
              <p>Punggol Walk, Punggol Way (Nibong &amp; Sumang LRT) - Unlikely to have service in near future given there's LRT and 382.</p>
              <p>Anchorvale St/Cres, Compassvale Cres - Probably a new Sengkang feeder.</p>
              <p>Sengkang West Rd, Seletar Aerospace Way - Unlikely to happen given the roundabout at Jln Kayu.</p>
              <p>Seletar East Camp - Heard 102 will be extended once the area is developed.</p>
              <p>Defu Ave 1 - Unlikely to be covered in near future.</p>
              <p>Balmoral Rd, Chancery Lane - Not sure if a new service is needed and feasible.</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 8 - No need for now.</p>
              <p>Woodlands Ave 10 - Bus stops were built long time ago but then abandoned. Maybe there will be a new service from Sembawang to Woodlands Industrial Park?</p>
              <p>Woodlands Industrial Park, Woodlands Ave 4 (between Ave 9 and Admiralty Rd West) - Same suggestion as above.</p>
              <p>Woodlands Ave 12 - Apparently there are some developments there. Can consider an express service from Sembawang via SLE.</p>
              <p>Sungei Kadut Dr and Choa Chu Kang Way - Maybe a new service from CCK in future if demand from Sungei Kadut is sufficient.</p>
              <p>Brickland Rd (between CCK Ave 3 and Ave 6) - No need for now, 301/983 at Ave 5 will do.</p>
              <p>Dairy Farm Rd - Rumoured new service 973?</p>
              <p>Bukit Batok St 31, West Ave 5 (between West Ave 2 and East Ave 5) - Hopefully will be considered together with the new developments nearby.</p>
              <p>International Rd (between Fan Yoong Rd and Corporation Rd) - New JIS needed but unlikely to happen in near future.</p>
              <p>Tuas West Rd - Bus stops nearby should be sufficient.</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px;"><strong>@array88:</strong> just my thoughts in red.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Loyang Dr, Loyang Lane, Loyang Way (between PSR Dr 3 and Loyang Lane) - Maybe a new service from Changi Villege / LYDEP will do. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">if sv 68 originating from CV going to Tampines can cover the untapped part of Loyang Industrial estate not covered by svc 6. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Flora Dr - Easiest way is to amend 37, but transfers to svc 2/5 will be lost. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cannot. svc 37 transfer to svc 2/5 is v. important. Guess they have to walk to Flora road and take sv 4 or walk up and take 2/5/37. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Tampines St 42/44 - Unlikely to be covered in near future. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes I Agree.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Tampines St 85/86 - Probably the upcoming Tampines feeder. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="font-size: 15.2px; color: #333333;">Tampines St 92/93/94 - Used to be served by 68, but since it was withdrawn, there's probably insufficient demand even for a peak-hour service. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Somapah Rd, Changi South Ave 1/3 - Maybe a new service from Changi Business Park Ter will serve SUTD. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Kaki Bukit Ave 2, Rd 3, Ave 3 - Maybe will have new service when DTL3 opens. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Def should be a new service especially when there are so many new business complexes around Bartley east as well. Surprised that still no service. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Ubi Ave 2, Rd 1/3 - Rumoured 137 from Sims Place to Ubi. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hope so. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Haig Rd - Could easily divert one service from Tg Katong Rd but apparently LTA doesn't want to do so. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The left turn from Changi road is the problem, but for sure one of the services such as sv 135 can do Tanjong Katong - Dunman - Haig. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Stadium Dr - Bus stops were built but no service. Once I thought 16 will be diverted back to Sports Hub but now it seems unlikely. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Demand is low maybe that's why!</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Punggol Walk, Punggol Way (Nibong &amp; Sumang LRT) - Unlikely to have service in near future given there's LRT and 382. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">LRT and svc 382 should be enough.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Anchorvale St/Cres, Compassvale Cres - Probably a new Sengkang feeder. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Sengkang West Rd, Seletar Aerospace Way - Unlikely to happen given the roundabout at Jln Kayu. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">No need as of now, but Sengkang west road could have svc 85 as it does not call Jalan Kayu/Seletar Circus roundabout anyway. It will be good for the farmlands/dorms to have at least one service and Jalan Kayu is crowded with 86, 102 and 103. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Seletar East Camp - Heard 102 will be extended once the area is developed. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Still lot of time for East Camp to develop, maybe 2-3 years.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Defu Ave 1 - Unlikely to be covered in near future. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree. Heard most of the complexes there are small business operations and hence does not have critical mass. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Balmoral Rd, Chancery Lane - Not sure if a new service is needed and feasible. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rich people's area. Don't think will have critical mass to justify service. </span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Yishun Ave 8 - No need for now. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Woodlands Ave 10 - Bus stops were built long time ago but then abandoned. Maybe there will be a new service from Sembawang to Woodlands Industrial Park? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Should have one soon.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Woodlands Industrial Park, Woodlands Ave 4 (between Ave 9 and Admiralty Rd West) - Same suggestion as above. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">There should have been a service launched long time back.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Woodlands Ave 12 - Apparently there are some developments there. Can consider an express service from Sembawang via SLE. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, there are.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Sungei Kadut Dr and Choa Chu Kang Way - Maybe a new service from CCK in future if demand from Sungei Kadut is sufficient. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The industrial estate is huge and does have critical mass to launch a service with DDs, just like JIS. But the whole area relies solely on private operators (except for the tiny bit that svc 925 covers).</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Brickland Rd (between CCK Ave 3 and Ave 6) - No need for now, 301/983 at Ave 5 will do. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Once Tengah town is developed. For now, easy access along ave 5.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Dairy Farm Rd - Rumoured new service 973? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Bukit Batok St 31, West Ave 5 (between West Ave 2 and East Ave 5) - Hopefully will be considered together with the new developments nearby. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">International Rd (between Fan Yoong Rd and Corporation Rd) - New JIS needed but unlikely to happen in near future. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes there is potential for one more JIS.</span></p>
              <p style="font-size: 15.2px;"><span style="color: #333333;">Tuas West Rd - Bus stops nearby should be sufficient. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The entire Tuas South area needs services. Maybe once MRT starts, can have some restructuring to have 2 new services cover Tuas South.</span></p>

              <p>Loading for 48 is okay la..Peak hours i see those two DDs not that full house.Maybe add 1 more DD better.</p>
              <p>36B can change to 36M.4 DDs and 2 SDs to supplement 36.Off peak frequencies between 14-19 mins and 8-13 mins during peak hours.Can built a small terminal office at Siglap Link there.</p>

              <p>48 main loading is AM from Marine Parade/Tanjong Katong to Bugis/Rochor. Almost every bus will be in red zone and will find it difficult to take pax at One Amber before hitting ECP. PM peak I agree, loading is spread out so not that full house. </p>
              <p>I really hope they build Siglap Terminal - have space + is a great location to house many services incl. 55, 135, 155 and 36M. This way Bishan, AMK and TPY can also get some relief if Siglap is made the main resting base. </p>

              <p>I think they got provision at Siglap also. </p>
              <p>Many of the feeders during peak hours park bus for 5 minutes and depart again. Also saw 145 at Toa Payoh during morning peak hours has waiting time of only 05-07 minutes before start next journey to BNV. </p>
