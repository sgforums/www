              <p>I agree all 3 can do well with DDs especially 901 and 903. Even 911 will be good with DDs. 912/913 may still be better of with A24s.</p>

                  901 901 is like 225 and 334 of SBST so i believe need. 
              
              912 would do well with DDs coz the route itself have only 1 bus that passed there for 80% of the route unlike 913 plus long haul travellers on 912 from checkpoint to Admiralty
              
              913 route is parallel to many routes like:
              
              178 at marsiling/checkpoint area.
              904/964 btwn admiralty mrt to woodlands mart area and all the trunks that plies admiralty mrt.
              
              thus bendy can still do the job
              
              All other feeders in Woodlands doesnt have much parallel to trunk svc except 913.

              <div class="canvas-body Wow(bw) Cl(start) Mb(20px) Fz(15px) Lh(1.6) C(#26282a) Ff($ff-secondary) D(i)">
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">As a result, former bus captain Nagibullah Raja Saleem nodded off while at the wheel, veered into oncoming traffic and nearly crashed into several vehicles, alarming passengers who were on board.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">The 27-year-old Singaporean was so intoxicated that his alcohol level was assessed to be 2.4 times the legal limit more than four hours after he finished his shift.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">Nagibullah pleaded guilty on Wednesday (7 June) to one count of driving in a rash manner, one count of drink driving, and one count of using a mobile communication device while the bus was in motion.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">A fourth charge of leaving the bus in a position likely to cause danger, obstruction or undue inconvenience will be applied to be withdrawn following Nagibullah’s sentencing.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">The court heard that from 10am to 3pm on 29 June last year, Nagibullah had consumed alcohol before driving bus service 162 at the start of his shift at 3.30pm.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">Even as he drove the bus, Nagibullah kept taking swigs from a 330ml bottle of blackcurrant vodka, which he had placed on the left side of the driver’s seat.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">A CCTV camera within the bus captured Nagibullah drinking from the bottle six times and driving recklessly between 4.15pm and 6.15pm, as he headed from Shenton Way bus terminal to Yio Chu Kang bus terminal.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">While making a right turn from Keppel Road into Anson Road, Nagibullah failed to give way to oncoming traffic, resulting in a near-collision with a car.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">Around 4.28pm, Nagibullah fell asleep at the wheel twice while the bus was still moving.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">Later, he dozed off for over a minute with his head against the steering wheel after his bus came to a stop at a red traffic light. He remained asleep even after the traffic signal turned green and only woke up when a male passenger approached and asked him why the bus wasn’t moving.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">While along Orchard Turn towards Orchard Boulevard at around 4.35pm, Nagibullah drove the bus into a lane meant for traffic in the opposite direction, causing alarmed passengers to shout “Hey! Hey! Hey!” at him.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">The male passenger who spoke to Nagibullah earlier asked him if he was in a condition to drive since he had fallen asleep. Nagibullah indicated that he was able to do so. A female passenger approached Nagibullah and told him that she would report him if he did not drive carefully.</p>
              <p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm">However, Nagibullah fell asleep again and failed to move off at a green traffic signal, despite motorists horning at him.

              <p>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ex-sbs-bus-captain-convicted-drinking-vodka-driving-duty-110612081.html</p>
              <p>"He continued consuming vodka while ferrying
                  passengers on an SBS Transit bus even after having drunk over five
                  hours before the start of his shift.</p>
              <div>
              <p>As a result, former bus captain Nagibullah Raja Saleem
                  nodded off while at the wheel, veered into oncoming traffic and
                  nearly crashed into several vehicles, alarming passengers who
                  were on board.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old Singaporean was so intoxicated
                  that his alcohol level was assessed to be 2.4 times the legal limit
                  more than four hours after he finished his shift.</p>
              <p>Nagibullah pleaded guilty on Wednesday (7 June) to one
                  count of driving in a rash manner, one count of drink driving, and
                  one count of using a mobile communication device while the bus was
                  in motion.</p>
              <p>A fourth charge of leaving the bus in a
                  position likely to cause danger, obstruction or undue
                  inconvenience will be applied to be withdrawn following
                  Nagibullah’s sentencing.</p>
              <p>The court heard that from 10am to 3pm on 29 June last
                  year, Nagibullah had consumed alcohol before driving bus service
                  162 at the start of his shift at 3.30pm.</p>
              <p>Even as he drove the bus, Nagibullah kept taking
                  swigs from a 330ml bottle of blackcurrant vodka, which he had
                  placed on the left side of the driver’s seat.</p>
              <p>A CCTV camera within the bus captured Nagibullah
                  drinking from the bottle six times and driving recklessly between
                  4.15pm and 6.15pm, as he headed from Shenton Way bus terminal
                  to Yio Chu Kang bus terminal.</p>
              <p>While making a right turn from Keppel Road into
                  Anson Road, Nagibullah failed to give way to oncoming traffic,
                  resulting in a near-collision with a car.</p>
              <p>Around 4.28pm, Nagibullah fell asleep at the wheel
                  twice while the bus was still moving.</p>
              <p>Later, he dozed off for over a minute with his head
                  against the steering wheel after his bus came to a stop at a red
                  traffic light. He remained asleep even after the traffic signal
                  turned green and only woke up when a male passenger approached and
                  asked him why the bus wasn’t moving.</p>
              <p>While along Orchard Turn towards Orchard Boulevard at
                  around 4.35pm, Nagibullah drove the bus into a lane meant for
                  traffic in the opposite direction, causing alarmed passengers to
                  shout “Hey! Hey! Hey!” at him.</p>
              <p>The male passenger who spoke to Nagibullah earlier
                  asked him if he was in a condition to drive since he had fallen
                  asleep. Nagibullah indicated that he was able to do so. A female
                  passenger approached Nagibullah and told him that she would
                  report him if he did not drive carefully.</p>
              <p>However, Nagibullah fell asleep again and failed to
                  move off at a green traffic signal, despite motorists horning at
                  him. The same female passenger again warned him that she would
                  report him if he were to repeat his mistake.</p>
              <p>While driving, Nagibullah’s bus would swerve sideways
                  and encroach into other lanes, prompting other motorists to
                  honk at him.</p>
              <p>At one point, Nagibullah missed a bus stop despite
                  passengers repeatedly pressing the bell. As a result, he alighted
                  passengers along a bend in the road.</p>
              <p>After the bus was off-service at around 5.37pm,
                  Nagibullah drove it from Yio Chu Kang terminal to the Shenton Way
                  bus terminal via the CTE.</p>
              <p>While on the expressway, Nagibullah stopped the bus
                  along the leftmost lane for some 45 seconds, forcing other vehicles
                  to go around it. He also failed to brake when the bus was
                  stationary, causing it to roll back slightly before he moved
                  forward.</p>
              <p>The CCTV camera also showed Nagibullah
                  taking both hands off the steering wheel to check his
                  mobile phone for 20 seconds as the bus was moving. He even picked
                  up a passenger in the off-service bus but let
                  the passenger alight a few minutes later.</p>
              <p>After Nagibullah reached the bus terminal, he
                  failed to park the bus properly and went against the bus
                  depot’s flow of traffic.</p>
              <p>When a timekeeping duty officer, who was informed
                  about the incident, went to check on Nagibullah, he found
                  Nagibullah at the driver’s seat with the engine still running.</p>
              <p>The officer then asked Nagibullah to move to the
                  passenger seat while he took over the parking. He also saw an empty
                  vodka bottle in a plastic bag at the left side of the driver’s
                  seat.</p>
              <p>Police were informed of the incident and arrived at the
                  bus terminal at around 9.19pm. Staff Sergeant Sritharan Subramaniam
                  interviewed Nagibullah and found that his face was flushed with
                  bloodshot eyes, and he was slurring.</p>
              <div>
              <p>At around 11.07pm, Nagibullah was arrested and brought
                  to the Traffic Police Headquarters, where he took and failed a
                  breathalyzer test.</p>
              <p>Nagibullah, who is represented by lawyer Richard Siaw,
                  will return to court on 5 July.</p>
              <p>For rash driving, Nagibullah can be jailed up to six
                  months and/or fined up to $1,000. On a first conviction for drink
                  driving, he can be jailed up to six months or fined between $1,000
                  and $5,000. For using a mobile communication device while the bus
                  was in motion, he can be jailed up to six months and/or fined up to

Likewise for some other users who recently re-surfaced here. I am utterly disappointed about the culture here. Nonetheless, I wish everyone all the best. I believe I have already done my best, to help contribute to the forum community, but I don't think I can help anymore. If this ship is sinking beyond repair, maybe it's better for me to leave.
