In fact, when 258 was launched two years ago, I was expecting them to deploy Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses, so I could say "I take Mercedes to school everyday".</p>

But what remains is that group of people who would continue to take 258 at Jurong West to connect to their buses at Joo Koon Bus Interchange. The bus would be very packed in the morning at around 6am, but during other hours, it should be quite empty.</p>
                                                                          
                                                                          <p>Perhaps a higher frequency during morning peak hours would help. But generally, it would be more appropriate for 258 to have single-decker buses, instead of double-decker buses. No need for double-decker buses, actually.</p>

              <p>They are occasionally bunching...and at times, at irregular intervals.</p>
              <p>You can see 3-4 860 buses sticking closely to one another, then a big gap before the next wave comes in. Even the Citaros are rather empty, BC stepping on acclerator to rush for schedule. </p>
