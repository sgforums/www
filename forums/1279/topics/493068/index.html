              <p>Jam is basically paralyzing the south side of Tampines Int (the
              side with 969 et al). The traffic controllers are inept at
              directing the flow of buses!</p>
              <p>Just boarded 969, 10 mins already the bus is still stuck in the
              interchange!</p>
              <p>(Side note: Despite the long wait for the bus, there are people
              who are happy to wait for the next bus still!)</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>I heard that the jam started from 3 pm, was surprised because I
              thought it started only during the rush hour ... ?</p>
              <p>Since I'm still stuck at the interchange, some thoughts:</p>
              <p>While 18 and 39 will be relocated to Tampines Concourse Int, 127
              will probably take the booth of one of the services above, so the
              south side (so to speak) will still be a cluster mess?!?</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>After 19 minutes the bus I am on has finally departed the
              interchange!</p>
              <p>More observations:</p>
              <p>The buses were "deadlocked" for a good 10 minutes ... until a
              SBST DD made a three-point turn at the entrance to get out of the
              interchange ... and then 2x svc 3, 1x svc 67, 1x svc 969 bus
              decided that they could do without picking up passengers from the
              interchange and headed out, which allowed the rest of the buses to
              move ... Seeing as the situation appeared to be resolved I quickly
              boarded a departing 969 ... only to get stuck in another gridlock
              ...</p>

              <p>Hi mr orange28, tampines bus interchange is what I called a grossly overcrowded area with buses, shops and human traffic. From 19 dec 2016, 2 bus services (18 and 39) will shft out and 1 new bus 127 will come in. On hindsight, it should have helped. To look further, I hope the authorities should stop giving new bus services to tampines main int and just give it to tampines concourse. With DTL3 tampines west and tampines east mrt coming next yr, demand for bus services will definitely drop. Some effort should be spent to streamline the services at tampines area. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Agree mostly with what you said. As I suggested earlier svc 127 will probably take either of svcs 18/39 berth on that side of the interchange, rather than the other (south) side with svcs 969/67 etc. so the gridlock may have happened anyway. Though as you rightly pointed out, DTL3 is coming, and on the south side of Tampines Int, there are svcs 22 and 65 that highly duplicate sections of DTL3. Hopefully something will be done to either service so as to relieve overcrowding at the interchange. Cheers.</p>

              <p>46 is at the berth furthest away from MRT and already gets less than 5 pax most of the times. If new services are launched at Tampines Concourse Int without passing by MRT bus stop or major transfer points (e.g. Tampines Reg Lib), loading will surely be disastrous from the interchange.</p>
