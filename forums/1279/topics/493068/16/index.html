              <p>Was wondering if it is possible to build a residential town within the Tuas planning area. Hence, I embarked on a research to study the geography of residential towns.</p>
                                                                                                          <p>First, I researched on the minimum population required for a residential town to be sustainable. To do this, I referred to the master plan for the upcoming Tengah residential town, and found the provision of school vacancy to be 2 residential apartments to 1 school vacancy. Based on that, I deduced the minimum population to be 7,360 residential apartments.</p>
                                                                                                           <p>Next, I researched on the number of shops that could sustain with 7,360 residential apartments. I analysed the number of shops and residential apartments at Sembawang residential town, and found the provision of shops to be 108 residential apartments to 1 shop.</p>
                                                                                                          <p>Thereafter, I researched on the provision of employment for the population of 7,360 residential apartments. I understand that every residential town has a corner set aside for industrial development. The figures were hard to find, but I managed to find the number of workers at Seletar Aerospace park, and used that to estimate the number of employment opportunities at Tengah residential town to be around 13 thousand. With that, I estimate the provision of employment opportunities to be 3 residential apartments to 1 job.</p>
                                                                                                          <p>Having found the ratio of residential apartments to school vacancy, shop and job vacancy, I deduced the minimum number of buildings to be 2 schools, 7360 residential apartments, 68 shops and 2453 jobs, and based on the map, I found the minimum land area required for residential town to be 112.5 hectares.</p>
                                                                                                          <p>However, I understand that a residential town needs other infrastructure like Roads, Parks, and Utilities. So, I studied the master plan of Punggol and Punggol North, and found the allocation of land in a residential town to be as follows,</p>
                                                                                                          <p>Road â€“ 26%; Park â€“ 8%; Civic and Community â€“ 2%; Utility â€“ 1%; Reserve Site â€“ 3%; Residential, Education, Commercial, Business â€“ 60%.</p>
                                                                                                          <p>With the allocation of land obtained, I found the minimum area required for residential town to be 187.5 hectares.</p>
                                                                                          
                                                                                           <p>For Tuas, there is no need for employment opportunity at the residential area, since there are already plenty of employment opportunities around. So, only 123 hectares of land is required to build a residential town at Tuas.</p>
                                                                        <p>There are many ways to carve out 123 hectares of land to build residential town.</p>
                          <p>In fact, we could have waterfront housing along the coastline at Tuas West Drive, houses at Tuas West Drive and Pioneer Road, primary school and secondary school in the middle of residential apartments, and a green corridor wrapped around the town, to create some sort of barrier between the industrial and residential area. Meanwhile, the shopping mall and community buildings can be near Tuas West Road MRT station, and a linear park could be built along Pioneer Road towards the coastline, where we could have a waterfront promenade by the strait of Johor...</p>            
                                                                                      <p>However, a residential town at Tuas may lack attractiveness and vibrancy. People may not want to live in a factory area, or at a town with only 7,000 people.</p>
                                                                                           
                                                                                           <p>Therefore, it is not possible to build a residential town at Tuas.</p>

                                  <p>But right now it does not stop at that TPE bus stop, previously

                                  express from Upper Changi to Woodlands ...</p>
                                  <p>If TS1 accepts distance fares (even express fares) then I can
                                  see it becoming very popular with commuters, especially those
                                  staying in Woodlands or those working at Changi Business Park. But
                                  right now the fares are very high and act as a barrier to higher

                                  <p>The cross-border bus services are for the people at Johor Bahru to travel to Singapore, whether is it our public bus services 160, 170 and 950, or the private bus services like AC7. They use the buses to go to Singapore to work.</p>
                                  <p>The public buses are well utilized because it connects to Kranji MRT station, where commuters can use the MRT to connect to their work place in Singapore (usually the City Centre, sometimes along the various MRT stations in the west).</p>
                                  <p>Private buses like AC7 like to go to Yishun, probably because along the way, it runs to industrial areas at Woodlands and Sembawang, and the commuters from Johor Bahru go there for employment opportunities. </p>
                                  <p>The same applies for the other private buses that go to industrial areas elsewhere.</p>
                                  <p>I do not know about Sengkang. I understand the area around Jalan Kayu will have industrial developments in future, but as of now, there is no industrial area at Sengkang.</p>
                                  <p>The employment opportunities at Sengkang are only limited to the commercial areas in the town, such as Compass One Shopping Centre, Seletar Mall, and the Hawker Centre near Compass One Shopping Centre. Even so, most if not all the employees are those living around Sengkang, in Singapore.</p>
                                  <p>As far as I know, the people from Johor Bahru do not like to travel to areas like Tampines because of the long travel distance, and the long travel time, which also translates to higher transport cost. I had a work mate who once worked at Tampines, and lived at Setia Indah area in Johor, Malaysia. She told me it was very tiring to travel long hours, and have only a few hours to rest, before she makes her way to Tampines, Singapore again.</p>
                                  <p>If areas like Tampines are not preferred employment locations for the people from Johor Bahru, I do not think Sengkang is attractive for them also.</p>
                                  <p>Of course, you can say that there is the public bus service 161 that originates from Woodlands Bus Interchange and passes by Sengkang area. However, you should consider that the Johor Bahru residents must take 950 from the custom to Woodlands Bus Interchange, and 950 winds around the northern residential areas before reaching Woodlands.</p> 
                                  <p>Rather than take another public bus service 161 to Sengkang, most commuters from Johor Bahru who take 950 to Woodlands Bus Interchange would end their journey there, and work at the nearby Causeway Point Shopping Centre, or the Woodlands Civic Centre behind.</p> 
                                  <p>After all, the employment opportunities at Sengkang can all be found at Woodlands area; there is no need for them to travel further to Sengkang when Woodlands has the employment opportunities that they want.</p>
                                  <p>Anyway, I do not see the need for the cross-border bus services to go to Sengkang. There is no major employment area in Sengkang.</p> 
                                  <p>The major employment areas in the East are at Tampines North, Changi Airport, and Paya Lebar. If there is demand for cross-border bus services to the East, it is probably to those areas, and not to Sengkang.</p>
                                  <p>Even if the cross-border bus service is for the local Singaporeans at Sengkang to take to the workplace at Changi, I believe there are other bus services by the public bus operators that provide the same connection; the demand for cross-border bus services to provide that connection should be rather obsolete.</p>
