              <p>Misunderstood.</p>
              <p>I think it was the initial configurations when they are
              new that made the performance of the bus so bad, like the gear
              tuning, the engine brake and probably the speed limiter. I believed
              the gears, when the buses was new, was so tightly limited
              that it failed to release the full potential power for each gear
              shift. Hence limiting the potential full power of the Scania
              engine. I believe that Scania buses are generally very powerful
              buses, even the older N113CRBs have as powerful engines like the
              O405s. There goes for the L series as well.</p>
              <p>Now without the engine brakes and fine tuning of the gears, the
              buses feel smoother and less jerky. However some gear tuning
              needs to be considered for improvements as there is still
              limitations, which cause the engine to rumble at low speeds, during
              gear changes.</p>
              <p>However I think it is the bodyworks that cause the bus to have a
              bad reputation. I don't think that Gemilang is suitable for the
              Scania engine, since their engines are mounted in a way that are
              quite seperate from the chassis., not sure about this but I hope
              someone can verify this. Even the OC500LEs are also vibrating now.
              I think an European bodywork like from Alexander Dennis or Wright
              or even Scania's own in house bodyworks can handle and cushion the
              vibrations of the Scania chassis and engine layouts better
              than Gemilang. If SBST had chosen the European bodies, most likely
              they might save a lot on correction costs on the bodywork.</p>
              <p>But then during that moment of meeting the WAB bus fleet
              criteria and replacing the old buses which cannot be further be
              extended anymore, SBST had no choice but to get the Scanias. Having
              1100 of the same kind is more than enough, and I hope that they can
              venture in other makes in future. At least they are improving the
              performance of the buses now, but I think that the bus is still
              hard and costly to maintain and also not so easy to drive as
              compared to other models. Based on the performance of these buses
              and the need of constant maintainance costs of these buses, I have
              doubts that the model might not fully serving its 17 years
              lifespan.</p>
              <p>Right now, they should address the issue of the radiator noise
              by installing some insulators and also the air con. Some of the
              older KUBs, especially the EEVs had weak air cons.</p>
              <p>However I am still puzzled by their decision of purchase that
              time. Why choose the K series which uses longitudinally engine that
              takes up more space and hence the higher aisle at the rear where
              the N series can save more space in the interior with its
              transversely mounted engine?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>i have reason to believe that the engines were governed because of the initial manufacturer warranty phase to prevent any unnecessary wear and tear that may not be covered under warranty. i believe that the manufacturer's warranty period is over or about to end, thats why SBST is able to finetune the operating characteristics of the engine to better suit local settings.</p>
              <p>i believe the K series buses are easier to maintain compared to the N series? not too sure about that though. N series would have allowed SBST to possibly have a low-floor bus interior much like the citaros or the MAN NL323F.</p>

              I used to dislike the KUBs when its initially introduced. But now, I have grown to like them esp when the Euro 4 had their engines finetuned. More buses seem to have more powerful acceleration than before and its good the engine brakes are virtually diminished. Euro 5 buses are quite good too.
              
              I think the bus may be even better with other types of bodywork. The old SBST &amp; SMRT buses with Alexander, Volgren and Hispano bodywork were remarkably good.

              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>According to Scania's specification sheets, the N series are
              indeed fully low floor. As what has been mentioned by SBS9818A, the maintenance
              may indeed be harder due to the compactness of the engine and drivetrain
              components. Although this issue might be solved with the use of integral scania
              bodywork which offers better serviceability because of a better design, that
              might bring up the cost of the whole vehicle (which is why they probably opted
              to get the citaro instead, because simply the citaro is 1 ton lighter than it's
              equivalent low floor competitors). </span></span></p>
