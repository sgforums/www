This applies to all Air-conditioned Bus Interchange, and for all future integrated bus interchanges.<br><br>They only submit the proposal to the VTL Division, BTR Department for approval.  Things like how it looks and whether the air-con is cold or not is not within the purview of VTL-BTR to decide.  They only decide on the physical layout of the interchange, like where the boarding berths and alighting berths are, as well as the entrance and exit of the interchange.<br><br>If you want to pinpoint fingers, point it at the operators of the Interchanges, as they are the ones who approved the whole design, as they will be the ones who operates the interchanges, and who must live with the design.<br><br>For the case of Sengkang, after much feedback from both the public and operators, it was decided to imporve the interchange, and at the same time, make it Barrier Free Access for the disabled.<br><br>For AMK Interchange, BTR can share some of the blame as they did not forsee the large volume of buses that will use the interchange during the peak periods.  The operators also have to share part of teh blame as they did not point out the BTR nor the designers of the AMK HUB that the single entry and exit point will become a choke point by itself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

All this planners who designed these so call aircon interchanges with the exception of Toa Payoh should look at themselves and ask why they should continue designing the future interchanges. I dont expect it to be better for boon lay and clementi interchange. No wonder some has said that Singapore is lacking of local talents, I don't blame them.<br><br>Mediocity at it's very best.<br><br></div></blockquote>i believe these architects are not public transport commuters; thats why they lack the knowledge to design good bus interchanges. And worse still, they lack the initiative to do some research and analysis before designing the interchange, which i think severely lack the professionalism in their part.<br><br>And when these bunch of "donkeys" propose their design and concept, did SBST and LTA really looked into their design and forsee any problems, etc? and for SBST, did they get the right people (ground people esp) to evaluate the design? eg Interchange Manager, Senior BCs &amp; staff instead of someone who's high ranking but only hide in his office and did not even touch any of the public transport.<br>and what about LTA? VivoCity, AMK Bus Interchange, AMK Hub - all are examples of poor traffic management! What are those "donkeys" doing inside? sit idling for their pay packet and bonus or planning for their next holiday?<br><br>and abt lacking of local talents - will good talents really want to choose Singapore, honestly? i bet they rather go to Australia, US or Canada instead! and sg? its only a "refuse collection point" for admitting those so-called "foreign talents"!<br><br></div>
