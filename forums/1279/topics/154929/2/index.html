You have clearly shown time and time again to be insistent about your opinion even when you have been proven wrong.<br><br>Like you said,<br><blockquote>During AM peak bet 0630 and 0730, Sv 90 faces 'shortage' of buses to cope with personnal boarding from Jln Toa Payoh. The only alt is taking Sv 151 and walk in</blockquote>there is only one alternative. Isn't that tantamount to forcing them to take Sv. 151 and forcing them to walk in because they cannot take Sv. 90? Willing to walk in here means that they will die-die take Sv. 151 even when Sv. 90 is not packed and walk into PLAB. Does that make sense to you? Would you be willing to walk in the morning heat coupled with the fumes from passing traffic? Don't give me the crap about how "they have no choice" because that is FORCING them to walk because of a lack of alternatives.<br><br>Don't try to play the language game with me.</div>

I know people who work at PLAB. If I get posted to PLAB I can always get a ride from these people or 2.40. Moreover I do not need to depend on Sv. 90. Stupid fuck you are.</div>
