              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>16 public buses to have protective screens for drivers in six-month trial</strong></span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE — Sixteen public buses will be retrofitted with protective screens for drivers as part of a six-month trial to see if they are effective in shielding the drivers from harm.<br><br>The trial of the impact-resistant screens will begin by early next year, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min in Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 7). He was responding to a question by Tanjong Pagar Member of Parliament Melvin Yong, who asked if the authorities would consider installing screens to protect bus captains here and to reduce the risk of a hijacking.<br><br>The four public bus operators here - Go-Ahead Singapore, SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and Tower Transit – will be involved in the trial, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).<br><br>The trial will allow the LTA to gather feedback from commuters and bus captains on the screens, which have attracted complaints in other countries relating to their “blinding glare”, said Dr Lam.<br><br>Places that have adopted protective screens for bus drivers include London in the United Kingdom and Victoria in Australia.<br><br>According to Transport for London (TfL), a local government body, bus drivers also have instant radio access to a control room that is linked to police officers. The BBC also reported in 2014 TfL had Workplace Violence Units for front-line bus and Tube staff that support the investigation of assaults on operational staff.<br><br>Last December, Australian newspaper The Age reported that passenger buses in Victoria would be fitted with security screens to protect drivers from assault. The measure would take about three years to implement on about 2,000 existing buses.<br><br>Assaults on bus captains in Singapore include incidents on Dec 31 in which three bus captains — one driving Service 93 and two others driving Service 129 — were physically assaulted by a male commuter who had boarded their buses along Bartley Road.<br><br>Bus operators here have various measures to protect their drivers.<br><br>Tower Transit previously said it was partnering with the Certis CISCO Academy to teach drivers to deal with conflicts and hostile situations, for instance.<br><br>SBS Transit’s drivers also undergo incident management courses to defuse and de-escalate conflicts, Channel NewsAsia reported in January. Its buses have an emergency button that drivers can use to alert the control centre to dispatch a traffic inspector.</p>

              <p>The first batch of buses with transparent protection shield at the bus driver seat commence operations today, providing bus captain a higher level of safety assurance.</p>
                      
                      <p>16 buses would be installed with the protection shield for 6 months, as part of a trial announced in parliament in November last year.</p>
                      
                      <p>The National Transport Workersâ€™ Union would collect feedback from bus captains and passengers, and work with LTA and bus operators if there is a need to improve the design of the protection shield.</p>
                      
                      <p>The transparent protection shield separates the bus captain from the passengers.</p>
                      
                      <p>There is a hole at the coin box area, and a few holes at the protection shield door area, to make it easier for passengers to communicate with the bus captain.</p>
                      
                      <p>4 bus operators, SBS Transit, SMRT, Go Ahead and Tower Transit participate in the trial.</p>
                      
                      <p>Tower Transit has 4 buses, each deployed on 990, 945, 284 and 77, with effect from today.</p>
                      <p>SMRT has 4 buses, each deployed on 960, 964, 172 and 951E, with effect from tomorrow (951E from Monday).</p>

              <p>Indeed.  SG is in the process of implementing the competitive tendering of bus operations just as Perth did from the mid-1990s.  Furthermore, the whole concept of government-owned infrastructure, planning and approval, with private franchised contracts with performance rewards and/or penalties is very reminicent of what we have in Perth.</p>
