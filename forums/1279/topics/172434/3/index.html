The truck suffered a damaged front right (not left) &amp; a cracked windscreen. The bus had the whole area around the exit slightly dented in ( ya right, not much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ) &amp; a lot of broken glasses on the inside &amp; outside of the bus (and a few broken windows). 1 passenger slightly injured.

The refuse truck was driven off at the same time.<br><br>TIB657M [WL 178] punctured its front left tyre. Mechanics seen changing the tyre at around 3pm at the sv178 berth in BNL Int.</div>
