              Why not you go and count and  tell me and persuade me?
              U think i nvr take 238 before?
              238 freq around 5-6 mins still not enough?
              113 20 mins 1 bus and even it's full must take the next bus that is coming in 18 minutes
              you think hougang svc so pampered like svc 238?

Like you guys said, ppl wont move up to the upper deck, right? SBST has removed dds before from svc 291 and recently deployed dds back because ppl wont move up, since ppl wont move up why didnt SBST remove them? Thats why i think that svcs in jurong are pampered.

              <p>#Foreverbitchingabout113. You complain that 113 with 7 buses and it's super lousy frequency is still understandable. But do you have to make a big fuss out of it? I'm sure there's a reason why is there 7 buses for 113. </p>
              <p>You look at sv 238/269. Forever and always long quque. SD Fleet with crossover from different services and yet it's not enough to cater to the needs of the people. I give example, sv 238. As the only bus that serves LOR 8, and there is alot of people who lives at lor 8, of course they have to rely on 238. They would not want to take 232 to Lor 7 and walk since 232 takes a longer time to get them there, having it to serve those living at TPY lor 2/Lor 1 and Lor 6 people first. The first 3 stops of 238 calls has 235, which somehow helps to relive the load. but then the quque at TPY int, which i think you should really check out. Can stretch to Breadtalk by going one round if ALL buses are outside. If you were to notice TPY interchange, most of the buses parking at the Sawtooth berths mostly belong to 238, with only 2-3 belonging to 232/235 respectively and 2 for 231(W/G). Don't include 157 cause they have their own space to park their buses. That's partly why 163/73 has to loop at TPY interchange. On the other hand, your sv 113 the only reason why alot of people board is due to the long waiting time. If you want buses coming in at 5 mins per bus, it will be underutilized. Might as well have sibei slow frequency and pick up alot of people instead of having alot of buses and picking up little people. </p>
              <p>In fact , you should not compare 238 with 113. The scenarios are totally different IMO.</p>

              <p>I dont stay near hougang, neither have i taken 113 before, but at times like this you need to be slightly more understanding as the situation is not as bad yet. All that's needed to disrupt the frequency is a piw boarding and alighting, or a bc that's very "Safety First", or just a unlucky chain of red lights.</p>
              <p>Just 1 bus is full is nothing compared to some yishun feeder services before being converted to semi bendy fleet. Those days, you could have 2 to 3 sd driving pass you with full-to-the-door load, or 3 buses bunched together (sometimes even 4).</p>
              <p>Now, theres have access to sbst iris to gauge arrival times, and instead of taking 113, there's also loads of other services that can bring u to ur destination with just a short walk.</p>
              <p>You are already very privileged compared to ppl taking buses a decade ago, so please keep your rants to urself unless this happens frequently. I know that you dont like to wait very long for ur bus, but do remember, the bc also dosent want their breaks to be eaten up.</p>
