            <div class='col-md body'>SMRT usually have 2-3 bendies on sv 980 on most of the Sundays, however 2day only spotted 1 bendy on sv 980 plying along Upp Thomson.<br><br>When I travel towards the north to Yishun I notice tat 4-5 bendies are on sv 169 instead of sv 980.<br><br>Wat is really happening to SMRT??? Why SMRT rather put more bendies on a sv 169 which is low demand on Sundays??? Whereas sv 980 needs more bendies due to high demand  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS should be referring to TIB1072T which is the only bendy seen on service 980 today.<br><br>In fact, service 169 even though have many perm bendies on weekdays however most of them according to driver's duty roster at WRI canteen they are under "OFF" on Sundays, which means these bendies don't operate on Sundays. However those bendies spotted on service 169 today majority are cameos from WLDEP (one of them is TIB1192E if I am not wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )<br><br>Somehow I am also dismayed to see why today WLDEP have so many bendies on service 169 whereas today's service 980 still stick to their original rigid perms even on a Sunday. From what I know SMRT deploys bendies on service 980 depending on the bus drivers and their time slots.<br><br>In fact I also feel that WLDEP is too "pampered" with service 169 already.

It will be 70% to 90 plus% full and sometimes the BC doesn't stop.
