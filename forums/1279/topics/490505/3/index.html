              <p>This is eventually. For now, since they only need a few (ok maybe not a few, but only a portion) of buses to give Bulim, the BSEP buses will do. So they are transferring around such that the Bulim services are full-fleet Bulim buses, even if those services are not introduced under BSEP. This ensures that all buses in Bulim are govt assets.</p>

              <p>most likely they will be taking same model of buses and most of them are quite new actually (less than 5 years for citaros/B9TL)...</p>
              <p>as for those older buses, most likely LTA will just pay SBST/SMRT slightly higher amount to run them (to cover more frequent maintainance, etc etc)... </p>

              <p>yes... but depend on how u interpret "fully implemented".  is it based on current 3 packages + 9 existing packages or based on all 12 packages are tendered out completely...  i think it will be the latter (which mean 2022 and later )...by that time, can almost retire KUB already...</p>

              <p>Indeed I am referring to the latter.  KUB may be retired by that time, but do remember that right now Volvo is still producing a 4th batch of B9TLs in SBS specifications, part of which are BSEP (34xx) and hence Government owned, but the remainder of which (SBS1Z onwards) are <em>still SBS assets at the moment</em>.  I am referring to these buses which I expect to be bought (or otherwise taken over somehow) by LTA to become Government assets.</p>

              <p>They probably only buying the BSEP models (Wrights, Citaros, E500s and A22s). KUBs, CDGE B9TLs, OC500s, A24s and A95s will remain with their respective operators until they're decommissioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In future, only 4 bus models will be deployed by LTA itself. Unlikely we'll be seeing new Scanias anytime soon unless PAP lost power and incoming party strikes an exclusive deal with the Swedish automotive firm.</p>

              <p>I am not sure what is your obsession with linking high fares with everything related to the contracting model; you have mentioned this quite a few times in contracting threads. I doubt we will reach that kinds of fares anytime soon, it is just politically unwise for that to happen and that would mean that the contracting model has failed, therefore LTA will not allow that to happen. The wages, which if I am not wrong, are the biggest costs, and I doubt Singapore will reach Australian or UK levels of wages for drivers.</p>
              <p>If LTA doesn't buy those buses then SMRT could use them as a additional buses for the contracts that it wins, under the worst case scenairo (which is very unlikely due to the structure of GLCs), they could sell those buses, for overseas or for scrap. But then it will lead the public to question LTA on why are perfectly usable buses not being used,<span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">so LTA will want to avoid these issues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Furthermore, I think LTA will need every available bus to run its services + operational spares, it is financially unwise to buy a brand new bus when you have perfectly usable buses that won't be hitting the statutory lifespan expiry yet, and these buses will be cheaper to acquire due to depreciation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">T</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ill date the wording used in LTA's press releases does seem to signal that they will purchase the whole fleet. I am infering that this refers to the buses that would still be around in 2022 or so. It could happen before this, though, if they feel a need for a smoother transition.</span></p>
              <p>I think the MAN A22, A24 and A95 are probably the family of chassis with the most commonalities available in the market. More so than Scania, though Scania do have a product line in which buses have a lot of commonalities. Some product lines look and sound related and may even use the same engine but aren't really the same, eg. ADL E400 and E500 have very different engine compartment layouts, the Volvo B9L and B9TLs too have different engine compartment layouts, and this means more parts that are different are needed for the families of products from ADL, Volvo, etc.</p>
              <p>Since the MANs have similar engine compartment layouts, same engine, same gearboxes*, lots of common parts, integration of the MAN products is going to be easier than you think if and when LTA decides to buy the buses.</p>
              <p>*Dependent on individual buses compared.</p>

              <p>I am not sure what is your obsession with linking high fares
                                                              with everything related to the contracting model; you have
                                                              mentioned this quite a few times in contracting threads. I doubt we
                                                              will reach that kinds of fares anytime soon, it is just politically
                                                              unwise for that to happen and that would mean that the contracting
                                                              model has failed, therefore LTA will not allow that to happen. The
                                                              wages, which if I am not wrong, are the biggest costs, and I doubt
                                                              Singapore will reach Australian or UK levels of wages for
                                                              drivers.</p>
              <p>If LTA doesn't buy those buses then SMRT could use them as a
                                                              additional buses for the contracts that it wins, under the worst
                                                              case scenairo (which is very unlikely due to the structure of
                                                              GLCs), they could sell those buses, for overseas or for scrap. But
                                                              then it will lead the public to question LTA on why are perfectly
                                                              usable buses not being used,<span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">so LTA will want to avoid these
                                                              issues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Furthermore, I think LTA will
                                                              need every available bus to run its services + operational spares,
                                                              it is financially unwise to buy a brand new bus when you have
                                                              perfectly usable buses that won't be hitting the statutory lifespan
                                                              expiry yet, and these buses will be cheaper to acquire due to
                                                              depreciation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">T</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ill date the wording used in LTA's press
                                                              releases does seem to signal that they will purchase the whole
                                                              fleet. I am infering that this refers to the buses that would still
                                                              be around in 2022 or so. It could happen before this, though, if
                                                              they feel a need for a smoother transition.</span></p>
              <p>I think the MAN A22, A24 and A95 are probably the family of
                                                              chassis with the most commonalities available in the market. More
                                                              so than Scania, though Scania do have a product line in which buses
                                                              have a lot of commonalities. Some product lines look and sound
                                                              related and may even use the same engine but aren't really the
                                                              same, eg. ADL E400 and E500 have very different engine compartment
                                                              layouts, the Volvo B9L and B9TLs too have different engine
                                                              compartment layouts, and this means more parts that are different
                                                              are needed for the families of products from ADL, Volvo, etc.</p>
              <p>Since the MANs have similar engine compartment layouts, same
                                                              engine, same gearboxes*, lots of common parts, integration of the
                                                              MAN products is going to be easier than you think if and when LTA
                                                              decides to buy the buses.</p>

              <p>If LTA wants to avoid the issues of dealing with SMRT's unused fleet in the first place, this is the time to deal with it.

              <p>SMRT Buses already has to deal with redeploying articulated buses away from the Bulim package routes. If the third package is in SMRT's territory and SMRT Buses goes on to lose that tender, the result may be a large fleet of "homeless" step-floor articulated buses.</p>

              <p><a href="/forums/1279/topics/485108?page=20#post_11039189">Competition does not equate lower fares</a>. The example I previously gave was the bidding wars by local cable TV operators over football broadcasting rights. A similar principle applies to bus operators where they compete for drivers as a scarce resource.</p>
              <p>It is LTA's objective to lower costs (and indeed this is the whole point of GCM, which is also the original objective for Transperth/PTA). However, whether it will eventually work out in the long-term is unclear. There have been mixed results in different cities. Refer to <a href="/forums/1279/topics/485108?page=20#post_11038659">my fictional Merlion Transit scenario for an example of how GCM may go wrong, written way before any package was awarded</a>.</p>

              <p>If LTA wants to avoid the issues of dealing with SMRT's unused
                      fleet in the first place, this is the time to deal with it. Not
                      wait until as in the case of Melbourne, the Victorian state
                      government and Transdev are forced to deal with over 30 different
                      bus models from defunct operators for the size of less than 2
                      Singapore bus packages.</p>
              <p>SMRT Buses already has to deal with redeploying articulated
                      buses away from the Bulim package routes. If the third package is
                      in SMRT's territory and SMRT Buses goes on to lose that tender, the
                      result may be a large fleet of "homeless" step-floor articulated
                      buses.</p>
              <p>The writing is on the wall, look at the private sector:</p>

              <p>NMP Thomas Chua said that the GCM would <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/lui-addresses-potential-issues-may-affect-public-bus-industry?singlepage=true"> “exacerbate the manpower shortage" and "present a great challenge
                      to the operators of current bus services, school bus services and
                      logistics services</a>".</p>
              <p>There is good reason why LTA is tendering out 3 packages until
                      2022. It gives them a viable exit option if the whole scheme turned
                      out to be a disaster. Already, there are calls by academics for
                      Singapore's public transport to be <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/govt-should-run-public/2227380.html"> nationalised</a>.</p>

              <p>I don't profess support for every MAN product, I'm only stating the fact that the MAN A22, A24 and A95 are so similar and credits to them for making these three products for different market segments so similar that it makes maintenance and operations easy. This is in response to the countless posts where people think them as very different buses, they are not, and thats the beauty of the MAN A22, A24 and A95 family which I like about.</p>
              <p>If you want me to point out a MAN product which I don't particularly like, it is the MAN A66s/A80s which you can find in Melbourne. Those are problematic especially during summer when they tend to overheat, and you would know it yourself if you follow the discussions on Transdev Melbourne in another forum. And between the O.405 family and the SL/NL family, I would prefer the O.405 family. So its simply a case where my preferences are based on my knowledge of buses, just like a lot of people.</p>
              <p>Part of the reason why the contracting model in Melbourne hasn't gone down too well is because the package was too big, 1/3 of the bus network was tendered out. Yes, it may be less than the size of 2 packages in Singapore, but you have to compare the scale of the operations vs network. Australian bus companies have generally smaller fleets but the fleet is more diverse, and have a bigger geographical coverage, the longest bus routes (Smartbuses) in Melbourne were affected. So if sh!t happens, the percentage of commuters affected vis a vis total number of commuters will be bigger. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">The risk was that a new entrant would not perform up to standards and sadly complains went up. </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">The whole exercise was just poorly planned with regards to risk management. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If they had cut it into smaller packages, with more of a local emphasis, the fleet that needs to be taken over will be more homogenous, and less of such problems will occur. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You could see that LTA's approach is different, they are more cautious than PTV, only 3 out of 12 packages are tendered out/to be tendered out, and the 2 which have been awarded are awarded to different operators. This minimises the risk in a case where a certain operator fails to perform up to expectation. And the rest of the packages remain with existing operators until they are up for tender, which I take it that LTA wants to observe how the tendering system turns out before going full scale.</span></p>
              <p>The issues regarding private school bus operators are different from the issues concerning the public bus operators, school bus operators depend on patronage to earn revenue. Under the tendering system, public bus operators are free from revenue risk, and if they have bid for the packages with their eyes open, they should <span style="line-height: 1.231;">be earning profits. And I doubt LTA will make a politically unwise move to increase fares just because they are taking on the revenue risk.</span></p>
              <p>In any case if SMRT gets affected in the third tender, I'm sure they can find new services for any displaced buses, any upgrade in capacity will be welcomed by commuters of services which get these upgrades. Non WAB or not will become less of an issue as there are already so many WAB buses around that will allow them to meet the requirements.</p>
              <p>I do understand your concerns about the GCM, but I hope you look beyond the gloom and doom, because without this, bus operations in Singapore will never be profitable and has to be subsidized from rail operations.</p>
