              <p>Apologies, was rushing to type because of the GCM livery
              announcement.</p>
              <p>I meant that it is likely that if a new bus were to replace it,
              it will bear an SG plate, since I suspect all new buses are being
              delivered with SG plates, a result of the LTA taking over SBS
              contracts.</p>

              <p>SBST can use their old buses to replace the deregistered buses...they have so many spares buses... further, when GCM start, SBST will have some excess buses as well... they will have even more excess buses after loyang package (if LTA give go-ahead brand new SG plates buses, cos also not much BSEP buses to redeploy)... </p>

              <p>I have been asked to choose a colour that I would like to have as the common livery of buses in the Government Contracting Model, from the two colours - Red colour and Green colour - shortlisted by the LTA. To make a choice from the two colours, I considered the visibility, representation and uniqueness of the colours.</p>
                                                                              
                                                                              <p>In terms of visibility, I feel that the colour of the bus should make the bus stand out from the surrounding, so that it is comfortable for the eyes to see. I feel that Red colour bus is easier to see than Green colour bus. In a place where there is vegetation everywhere (note: 'vegetation' here refers to trees and grass, not pubic hair.), there is green in the surrounding. If the bus is Green colour, it would tend to blend in with the surrounding. If the bus is Red colour, it would tend to contrast with the surrounding, since very limited vegetation and buildings today are Red in colour. Therefore, I feel that Red is the better colour.</p>
                                                                         
                                                                              <p>In terms of representation, I feel that the colour of the common livery should represent the Singapore identity, since these are public buses on the public bus services in Singapore. Red colour has been related to Singapore since the early days when we were known as the "Little Red Dot". Red colour is one of the colours used on our National Flag and Crest.

Otherwise, the colour used less frequently would be more appropriate. As far as I know, Red colour is used on Fire Engines, and Green colour is used on Army tanks. Army tanks are usually not on public roads, unlike the Fire Engines which are usually on public roads. As such, Green colour is less frequently used in vehicles on public roads. Therefore, I feel that Green is the better colour.</p>

Although Green colour is more unique that Red colour, Red colour is more visible than Green colour, and it represents the Singapore identity.</p>

              <p>I have been asked to choose a colour that I would like to have
              as the common livery of buses in the Government Contracting Model,
              from the two colours - Red colour and Green colour - shortlisted by
              the LTA. To make a choice from the two colours, I considered the
              visibility, representation and uniqueness of the colours.</p>
              <p>In terms of visibility, I feel that the colour of the bus should
              make the bus stand out from the surrounding, so that it is
              comfortable for the eyes to see. I feel that Red colour bus is
              easier to see than Green colour bus. In a place where there is
              vegetation everywhere (note: 'vegetation' here refers to trees and
              grass, not pubic hair.), there is green in the surrounding. If the
              bus is Green colour, it would tend to blend in with the
              surrounding. If the bus is Red colour, it would tend to contrast
              with the surrounding, since very limited vegetation and buildings
              today are Red in colour. Therefore, I feel that Red is the better
              colour.</p>
              <p>In terms of representation, I feel that the colour of the common
              livery should represent the Singapore identity, since these are
              public buses on the public bus services in Singapore. Red colour

              never used to relate Singapore in any way. Green is a colour that
              is foreign to Singapore and does not represent the Singapore
              identity. Therefore, I feel that Red is the better colour.</p>

              common livery should not be the same as the colours used on other
              vehicles, to avoid confusion. Otherwise, the colour used less
              frequently would be more appropriate. As far as I know, Red colour
              is used on Fire Engines, and Green colour is used on Army tanks.
              Army tanks are usually not on public roads, unlike the Fire Engines
