              <p>Paperwork... depends, as all these matters are directly under LTA's purview and as such the amount of paperwork may be lessened.  Remember that an agreement has been reached to transfer legal ownership of SBS BSEP buses to LTA, which is a move I suspect is aimed at making it easier to re-register.  But I still feel that the SG series must have some significance, since LTA registered the first few TT buses as SG prefix.  If the ex-SBS buses were to retain SBS prefixes, then the new TT buses might as well use the TT prefix.</p>
              <p>As for the series, I'd suggest a new series in the thousands for each model. Re-regged B9TLs may use SG7xxx, for example.</p>

              <p>That is a good argument for a common rego prefix. However, I am still unsure of LTA's commitment to the common SG prefix, given that the latest batch of BSEP B9TL Wrights were registered in the SBS35XX series, which directly conflicts with SMRT's own double deck BSEP series.</p>

              <p>but you have a point when you say that about unique 4 digit identifiers. I remember this came out a few years back when the SMB13XX series of MANs came out, it was speculated that this was to avoid clashing with TIB425 onwards. Although that's within 1 company.</p>

              <p>That is a good argument for a common rego prefix. However, I am
                  still unsure of LTA's commitment to the common SG prefix, given
                  that the latest batch of BSEP B9TL Wrights were registered in the
                  SBS35XX series, which directly conflicts with SMRT's own double

              <p><strong>SALE OF NEW BUSES AND NOVATION OF CONTRACTS TO LAND TRANSPORT
              AUTHORITY </strong></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. SBS Transit Ltd (the ‘Company’) wishes to announce that it has signed a Letter Of
              Intent (‘LOI’) with the Land Transport Authority (‘LTA’) for the following:- </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(i) Sale of 50 new buses (‘Buses’) purchased by the Company from June 2015 to
              December 2015 to LTA. The Buses comprise 12 Single Deck buses and 38
              Double Deck buses. The purchase consideration for the Buses will be at their
              respective Net Book Value (NBV) as at 31 December 2015 (‘Effective Date’).
              The total NBV of the Buses as at Effective Date amounts to approximately $23
              million, representing 6.8% of the consolidated Net Asset Value of $338 million
              (as at 30 November 2015); and</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">(ii) Novation of procurement contracts (‘Contracts’) by the Company for purchase
              of new buses scheduled for delivery for 2016 and 2017 to LTA. The Contracts
              involve a total of 346 new buses comprising 100 Single Deck buses and 246
              Double Deck buses with a contracted value of approximately $164 million.
              Out of the 346 buses, 210 buses are scheduled for delivery in 2016 and the
              remaining 136 buses in 2017. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. The Company will be signing the relevant agreements with LTA for the sale of the
              Buses referred to in 1(i) and the novation of Contracts referred to in 1(ii). Following
              this, the Company will lease the affected buses from LTA for its operation until such
              time that these buses are handed over to the operators of the tendered contracts
              under the Government Contracting Model for bus services. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3. The above does not have any impact on the net tangible assets per share and the

              <p>There are some buses in the 3971-3986 range which were regged in May and there are some buses outside of that range which were regged in June. My interpretation is only those regged in June will be bought by LTA in this round.</p>
              <p>I do expect more of such rounds of bus purchasing by LTA from the 2 current operators.</p>
