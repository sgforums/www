              <p>Dear Sir/Mdm,</p>
              <p>We are now at the end of page 11 of this thread "GCM
                  New/Transferred Buses".</p>
              <p>We started this thread with a brief discussion about the
                  Government Contracting Model at pages 1 and 2. Then, we talked
                  about the buses that would be purchased and taken over by the LTA
                  at pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.</p>
              <p>Along the way, some of us post lists of new buses registered
                  with the "SG" index mark. Thanks for the sharing. Keep up the good
                  work. :)</p>
              <p>Next, we discussed about the interior design at page 8. At page
                  10, we discussed about the two livery options the LTA revealed and
                  asked us to choose one. Some of us expressed our thoughts and
                  opinions about the two colours. At page 11, I found the method to
                  find the suffix alphabet of vehicle license plates with the "SG"
                  index mark.</p>
              <p>So far, we have used</p>
              <p>- 6 pages on LTA purchasing buses (pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
                  9),</p>
              <p>- 2 pages on GCM (pages 1 and 2),</p>
              <p>- 1 page on interior design (page 8),</p>
              <p>- 1 page on livery (page 10),</p>
              <p>- 1 page on suffix alphabet (page 11).</p>
              <p>Now, we are moving on to page 12.</p>
              <p>Enough about LTA purchasing buses. We have already used 6 pages
                  to discuss about it.</p>
              <p>Forget about GCM. There is a dedicated thread for it. Anyway, we
                  have already used 2 pages to discuss about it.</p>
              <p>What else can we discuss?</p>
              <p>We could continue discussions on interior design, common livery
                  and "SG" index mark, for around one page worth each. Who knows
                  there is something new to discuss along the way, while we continue
                  discussion on these three topics.</p>
              <p>We could start discussions in new topics straightaway, if there
                  is something new to discuss now.</p>
              <p>Either way, let us not harp on a few topics and keep beating
                  around the bush about them, as we would only end up wasting time
                  discussing what has already been discussed thoroughly.</p>
              <p>I know this thread is about GCM new and transferred buses.
                  However, the word "bus" is not limited to only bus models and bus
                  deployment. Apart from models, deployment, interior design, common
                  livery, registration plate, there are many things about buses which
                  we have not discussed yet.</p>
              <p>For example, I remember the news on channel 5 said before that
                  bus company Go-Ahead will modify the buses to make them more energy
                  efficient. However, I have not seen any mention of this on the
                  forums. Perhaps we could write about it, about the possible
                  modifications that Go-Ahead could implement, while abide to the
                  rules, regulation, terms and conditions of GCM. Like, to what
                  extent are bus operators allowed to modify the buses owned by the
                  Government?</p>
              <p>Thank you everyone for the contributions thus far.</p>
              <p>Let us keep up the good work and continue to have fruitful
                  discussions. Have a good day, happy learning. :)</p>

              <p>Good question.  At ABCD, we saw 2 buses with green wheel nut checkers.  Probably counts.  Also, interior stickers like those which say Thank You For Travelling with SBST - those count as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this thread also compiles registrations &amp; dates of GCM buses (SG regos). </p>

                                              <p>no la. they should pass a law in parliament... say that if want to work in LTA must study in Singapore Polytechnic.... just like the opticians... to ensure a certain standard... :)</p>
                              <p>because foreign companies may not always have the best knowledge and skills... they usually only want to copy-paste from whatever they are doing in the other countries.... which may not work in singapore.</p>
                          <p>I mean, if it's about the engine and systems, then ya la... </p>
                          <p>but if it is the design and accessories, then I feel that the foreign companies have something to bring in to Singapore context. :)</p>
                      <p>okay. I have enough of using the internet. bye.</p>

              <p>Some casual comment on the colour options in the common livery:</p>
                      <p>Red colour is obviously copy the colour of London public buses.</p>
                      <p>Lush Green colour seems to copy the colour of Japan liveries on bus and trains.</p>

                      <p>In this case, I feel that we should copy Japan, because after all, we are Asians.</p>
                      <p>This is not a Malay nation, this is not a Chinese nation, this is not an Indian nation. Neither is this an English nation. We are an Asian nation. :)</p>
                      <p>In fact, I think China and India also got buses in bright green colour... even our Pulau NTU also have buses in greenn colour.... the more we should use green colour.</p>
