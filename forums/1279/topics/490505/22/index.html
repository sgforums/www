              <p>I don't think you get what I meant. The Melbourne (and Sydney) examples are not relevant as the bus companies are the ones buying the buses, while the government funds them, which is not disimilar to how its done under BSEP. This is different from the situation now in Singapore where LTA is buying buses directly. One would expect LTA to have consultations with the bus companies regarding their fleet and future purchases, as the bus companies are the end users of the buses and are responsible for their maintenance.</p>

              <p>I don't think you get what I meant. The Melbourne (and Sydney)

                                                                              the buses, while the government funds them, which is not disimilar

                                                                              now in Singapore where LTA is buying buses directly. One would

              <p>LTA is now buying buses directly (as Perth does). While it is okay to listen what bus operators generally have to say and consider them as an overall group, it is crazy for LTA to bend over backwards and buy specific model X for operator A, specific model Y for operator B and specific model Z for operator C for the same type of bus (e.g. double-decker buses).</p>
              <p>I am pointing out how Singapore might end up with Melbourne's (and Sydney's) situation if purchasing is done in a way as though the operators are the purchasers. LTA shouldn't be pandering to individual operators. At least I don't see that happening in Perth. While PTA WA used to make bad purchases, at least they stick to their guns.</p>
              <p>Let's say that operator A does get their way with getting LTA to purhcase model X and Y, while rejecting model W. Come 2022 when operators switch hands for the same parcel contract, can new operator B then reject model Y and get LTA to buy their own bus model Z for the same reasons operator A rejected model W?</p>
              <p>Operators should not reject buses unless (1) LTA was silly enough to put
                                                           a specific model in the contract that the operator could argue for a 
                                                          significant breach of terms, which means LTA has effectively tied its 
                                                          own hands or (2) the operator discovered some major defect with the buses they are about to 
                                                          receive.</p>
              <p>If LTA wanted operators to choose their own models then they should have stuck to the operator purchase and leasing model in Sydney, Melbourne, Macau and London.</p>

              <p>I don't think they are buying specific types for specific operators. The Wrights and Citaro orders were taken over by LTA (as per press release) as they need buses fast and also because LTA would be fully in charge of bus assets, which means that they will need to buy them from the bus companies if they didn't take over the orders. They have shown that they are spreading some of these resources around to all the bus companies, so there shouldn't be any issues at all. Aside from that point, the rest of your views have been explained as a summary at the start of my previous post.</p>
