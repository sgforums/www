              <p>I know many passengers are what the transport industry calls "captive audiences" and should not be taken seriously, but I doubt LTA wants to rub salt into their wounds.</p>
              <p>The last thing they want is for the motto to become the butt of jokes on SGAG or other social media.</p>
              <p>At least LTA isn't replicating SMRT's 2 + 2 mottos as other statutory boards have.</p>

              <p>Okay. This is revolutionary. I studied the vehicle license plates with the "SG" index mark and I found the method to find the suffix alphabet.</p>
                                                          <p>In the vehicle license plate,</p>
                                                          <ol>
                                                          <li>SG = index mark.</li>
                                                          <li>The four digits = registration number.</li>
                                                          <li>For easier calculation, the second, third and fourth digits are referred here as "code".</li>
                                          
                                                          </ol>
                                                          <p>There are 19 alphabets used for the suffix alphabet:</p>

                                                          <p>The cycle of the suffix alphabets repeats after every set of 18 registration numbers.</p>
                                                          <p>The range of registration numbers in a set is 17.</p>
                                                          <p>After fourth digit reaches nine, use the second suffix alphabet after that as the fourth digit recycles to zero.</p>
                                                          <p>(Use the second digit to determine how many suffix alphabets are skipped.)</p>

                                                      <p>- SG1035D (may be registered by May 2016. likely in bulim package)</p>
                                                      <p>- SG1111H (may be not so soon. around 2017. likely in loyang package)</p>
                                                      <p>Note: These are only forecasts; the actual suffix alphabets may be different.</p>
                                                      <p>If all four license plates come out, this means that my method is accurate.</p>

              <p>By the way, checking against the formula, I believe some of your guesses for the other starting digits are wrong. I calculated A, T, L, E, Z, S for SG plates 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000 and 7000 respectively.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Let me explain how my method works.</p>
                          <p>I mentioned that there are 19 alphabets used, and the alphabets are re-used after every set of 18 numbers. Each set has a range of 17.</p>
                          <p>First, I divide the registration number by 17 and rounded it up to find out which set (first set, second set, third set, etcetera.) that number is in.</p>
                          <p>Then, I multiply the "set number" by 17 to find the highest number in that set.</p>
                          <p>Next, I minus the highest number with the registration number, to find the difference of the registration number relative to the highest number. I add one to find the position of the registration number in that set.</p>
                          <p>As mentioned, the alphabets are re-used after every set of 18 numbers. After finding the position of the registration number in the set, I minus 19 with it to find the position of the alphabet relative to the first alphabet used in that set. From there, I referred to the list of alphabets (It's two lists of nineteen alphabets combined, for easy reference) and counted for the suffix alphabet.</p>
                          <p>This is how I find the suffix alphabet.</p>
                          <p>I am aware that after the fourth digit reaches nine, it will skip the next available alphabet and use the second alphabet when it recycles to zero.</p>
                          <p>When I listed the numbers accordingly in an Excel worksheet, I noticed that a set of nineteen alphabets has skipped alphabet(s) - sometimes one alphabet (D) skipped, sometimes two alphabets (A and X) skipped.</p>
                          <p>I believe it is because of two reasons that I am able to overcome this rule of skipping an alphabet after the forth digit reaches nine, and to deal with the skipped alphabet(s) in the set of nineteen alphabets used.</p>
                          <p>Firstly, when I find the position of the registration number in the set of eighteen numbers, I added one to the difference between the registration number and the highest number in the set of numbers. This compensates for one skipped alphabet.</p>
                          <p>Secondly, when I counted for the alphabet, I either count from the first alphabet or count after the first alphabet.</p>
                          <ol>
                          <li>If the first digit is "1" or "6"<span style="line-height: 1.231;">, there is only one skipped alphabet (D) and that one has already been compensated when I added one. Hence, I can count from first alphabet.</span></li>
                  <p> </p>
                          <li>Otherwise, if the first digit is "2", "3", "4", "5", "7", "8" or "9", there are two skipped alphabets (A and X). Although I have compensated for one skipped alphabet when I added one earlier, I still have to account for one more alphabet that is skipped. That is why when I count for the suffix alphabet, I have to skip the first alphabet before I start to count, so that I can make up for that one more skipped alphabet; when I skip the first alphabet, I compensate for the other skipped alphabet.</li>
                          <li><br></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">^ As mentioned, an alphabet is skipped after the fourth digit (last digit) reaches nine. Somehow, the row number coincides with this rule.</span></li>
                          </ol> 
                          <ul>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1. 000 - 017 (skip 1 alphabet)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2. 018 - 035 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">3. 036 - 053 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">4. 054 - 071 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">5. 072 - 089 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">6. 090 - 107 (skip 1 alphabet)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">7. 108 - 125 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">8. 126 - 143 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">9. 144 - 161 (skip 2 alphabets)</span></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Therefore, although there are skipped alphabet(s) in a set of nineteen alphabets, I am able to make up for the skipped alphabet(s).</p>
                          <p>This method may be the most accurate way to find the suffix alphabet.</p>
                          <p>In fact, you can ownself use this method to forecast the suffix alphabets that may be used for license plates registered this week and/or next week for the Volvo B9TL double decker buses, and check against the actual license plates when they are registered, to verify its accuracy.</p>

              <p>In the license plates with "SG" index marks, the first digit of the registration number denotes the series. Each series can have 999 numbers (eg. 5001 - 5999).</p>
                          <p>From what I know, the B9TL Double Decker buses are in the 5000 series and the Citaro Single Decker is in the 1000 series.</p>
                          <p>From my understanding, there are more than one thousand B9TL Double Decker buses. One series may not be enough.</p>
                          <p>I guess there may be another series used to register the B9TL Double Decker buses. In that other series, the Enviro500s and Man DDs may also use it since there are not a lot of them.</p>

              <p>Did I not post my guide over at the Miscellaneous topics thread?! Go over and read it all you want. I believe it is concise enough.</p>
              <p>Anyway, adding 3100 doesn't change the suffix letter. Using the 5-4-3-2 rule, adding 3100 increases 19 (3x5 plus 1x4 plus 0x3 plus 0x2), which is exactly one cycle on the remainder table.</p>
              <p>The same goes for other combinations (WITHOUT digit carrying over) such as +410, +18, +20-3, +100-2, +52, etc.</p>

                                                                                                                                                              <p>Enough about LTA purchasing buses. We have already used 6 pages to discuss about it.</p>
                                                                                                                                                              <p>Forget about GCM. There is a dedicated thread for it. Anyway, we have already used 2 pages to discuss about it.</p>
                                                                                                                                                              <p>What else can we discuss?</p>
                                                                                                                                                              <p>We could continue discussions on interior design, common livery and "SG" index mark, for around one page worth each. Who knows there is something new to discuss along the way, while we continue discussion on these three topics.</p>
                                                                                                              <p>We could start discussions in new topics straightaway, if there is something new to discuss now.</p>
                                                                                                                  <p>Either way, let us not harp on a few topics and keep beating around the bush about them, as we would only end up wasting time discussing what has already been discussed thoroughly.</p>
                                                                                          <p>I know this thread is about GCM new and transferred buses. However, the word "bus" is not limited to only bus models and bus deployment. Apart from models, deployment, interior design, common livery, registration plate, there are many things about buses which we have not discussed yet.</p>
                                          
                          <p>For example, I remember the news on channel 5 said before that bus company Go-Ahead will modify the buses to make them more energy efficient. However, I have not seen any mention of this on the forums. Perhaps we could write about it, about the possible modifications that Go-Ahead could implement, while abide to the rules, regulation, terms and conditions of GCM. Like, to what extent are bus operators allowed to modify the buses owned by the Government?</p>
