              <p>I'm guessing they are training for svc 386? Not surprise if they get lost. Ever since 386 got extended to Punggol East/Edgedale Plains, the route simply got more complicated. In addition with the two pairs of bus stops at the 2 roundabouts (at Edgefield and Edgedale Plains) with different bus stop going different directions. I think it's better to make the mistake now rather than making the mistake after it GAG is in service and officially took over 386.</p>

              <p>why you keep on complaining about not enough DDs for BCM? and not enough DDs for BBDEP and not enough DD for sv43?</p>
              <p>3509/3515/3520-3523 are out from sv2, but instead, they get some earlier BSEP buses (3474/3476-3480) to replace. so what is the issue? </p>
              <p>further, if u have bother to check , current Go-ahead svc only using 101 DDs (excluding SP), and 216 SDs.. (while Bulim svc use 162 SD and 152 DDs)..  so why do GA need so much DDs?  even if GA is to convert some fleet to DD( sv2/12/43), it will need just another 10-15 DDs will do.</p>

              <p>LTA can simply extend the lifespan till 20 years.. no issue at all. Road tax also no issue, cos is LTA pay LTA (and they cant lay up the buses as well, cos no insurance coverage during layup period i think)).. the only problem is insurance premium (this one no choice). </p>

              <p>Citaros are the same issue as well..</p>
              <p>LTA have slow down on the BSEP program and they dun really need
                  so much new buses for TT/GA.. and thus those new buses are just
                  rotting until they get utilized..</p>
              <p>anyway, this is just my thoughts... do not shoot me.. </p>

              <p>If not Loyang, then Seletar.</p>
              <p>LTA is still short of buses overall for the remaining two packages. So much so they had to <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/lta-to-take-over-sbs/2384488.html">buy back some from the operators</a> ("It will also directly buy 50 buses...").</p>

              <p>That is indeed what is implied by the news item. It does not, however, account for the fact that SBS 21-23 are still comfortably deployed in SL and 3520-3523 recently went off to BB.</p>

              <p>There is still time...Seletar won't be ready until 2018.</p>
              <p>However the concept bus order will not make this timeline, so LTA has to make do with whatever it already had from the incumbents.</p>
