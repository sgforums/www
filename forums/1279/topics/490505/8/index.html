              <p>Untrue. B9TL has slower acceleration, torque, horsepower. It is apparent; just try a B9 vs an E500 and you can feel it. Whether is it going up inclines or picking up speed, B9 is almost no match for E500. </p>
              <p>Another flaw in the B9 is SBST's stubbornness in mordernising the model. These are fine and little, yet noticeable points that do make that difference in travelling experience. Outdated seating layout, slanted bars even though there aren't steps at the entrance, swinging plug doors etc. Not to mention, the absence of a PIS system. This makes the B9 way more outdated and inferior interior-wise. </p>
              <p>Nonetheless, yes I agree the B9 has better build compared to the jerky A95, and the E500 which felt like the upper deck could separate from the chassis anytime soon. Hopefully LTA would not stop bringing in these stellar builds due to its manufacturers i.e. hope they find better manufacturers for them.</p>

              <p>And if the changes do help why not? PIS do benefit commuters so they know where to alight. Especially when stops in SG are spread like sesame seeds, it isn't easy to locate a precise stop... And sliding plug doors close faster so buses can leave earlier, also uses less space as you dont have that big ass spiral... the swinging radius also smaller, meaning less chance of hitting people or objects outside the bus (though quite unlikely)</p>
              <p>And do we really pay more, just to adjust a bar or switch a few seats around? Doubt so...</p>

              <p>Notice how the trident has straight door bars at the front. And
                  yes, it is step free. </p>
              <p>Regarding the swing door, I've already shown the benefits of the
                  newer design. I feel these benefits are justifiable for the
                  costs. </p>

              <p>That's worse. You could unscrew the curved doors bars and screw in a new set of straight ones. It doesn't cost more than a few hundred dollars. SMRT Buses has done that before. Why would you condemn an entire chassis over cosmetic designs?</p>
              <p>Even if they are straight, people are not supposed to go near it anyway (Australia designates them as no-standing zones, refer to photo above).</p>

              <p>I never ever said the people are supposed to go near... You see, the straight bars are easier for passengers, especially the elderly to grip on instead of the horribly steep slant bars on the B9 and KUB.</p>

              <p>Further to sgbuses' posts, it has to be noted that we should stop seeing things with separate views of SBS and SMRT. The situation has changed, it is just LTA buying buses, while operators run those buses. LTA is free to choose whatever that suits their requirements, though I think they will be taking in feedback about buses from the current operators as LTA themselves are new to buying buses.</p>

              <p>Instead of trying to do the maths for buses allocated to respective schemes, why not try to do the maths for the respective models already registered? I highly doubt that the figure allocated to BSEP still remains as 296 given that no one had expected new buses to be registered as SG regos...</p>
              <p>If I consider the new SG rego buses to be funded (and therefore owned) by LTA before they announced the buyover, 92 Wrights and 77 Citaros (including 6546-6549, after all there are only 100 left to be delivered, it does not make sense to me that 6846-6865 are Batch 2, because they made up a total of 125 buses if under Batch 3) had been registered under LTA ownership. There will be 127 left for the original BSEP 2, and given that 240 out of the 665 have been registered, the remaining order uncompleted would have been 298. But do not forget some buses had already been delivered but not yet registered, because so many regoless Citaros are inside C&amp;C recently.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the 346 buses undelivered were due for completion in 2017 which may have included BSEP in my opinion because they are all from a single order.</p>
