              <p>I do not think wholesale depot shifts are specified in GCM contracts. That is a very unlikely scenario, unless LTA is expecting at least one operator to go bust in the next few years.</p>
              <p>Contract areas (and consequently, depots) changing hands (e.g. Bulim going to SBS Transit) is still at least 5 years away.

              <p>For every extra model the operator receives, the operator has to buy and store its own spare parts. That adds extra costs. If the parts are out of stock, do not expect to ask rival operators for help. They do not and will not. LTA might be able to ask nicely (the same way they ask for drivers from SBS Transit during SMRT drivers strike), but they cannot compel another operator in such a scenario.</p>
              <p>The risk for operating a small variant fleet is that they can remain out of service for months while waiting for the spare parts to be shipped in. We have seen that with many of the demonstrator buses.</p>

              <p>Exactly seeing that GCM will inevitably see the chances of a switch in operator (and hence, a shift in depots for operators and subsequently the fleets) that LTA is prompting operators to equip themselves with parts NOW than later, when they will be frantically hunting for the parts. This is done by mixing up the fleets for different depots beforehand, before GCM kicks in full force. </p>

                  is no guarantee the mechanic taking on a new model now is going to
                  stay on for the next five years. Even so, operators are given at
                  least 6 months in advance to make such preparations.</p>
              <p>For every extra model the operator receives, the operator has to
                  buy and store its own spare parts. That adds extra costs. If the
                  parts are out of stock, do not expect to ask rival operators for
                  help. They do not and will not. LTA might be able to ask nicely
                  (the same way they ask for drivers from SBS Transit during SMRT
                  drivers strike), but they cannot compel another operator in such a
                  scenario.</p>
              <p>The risk for operating a small variant fleet is that they can
                  remain out of service for months while waiting for the spare parts
                  to be shipped in. We have seen that with many of the demonstrator
                  buses.</p>

              <p>What you are saying applies to the entire country as well. Are you suggesting that all buses in Singapore be standardised? I understand where you are coming from on that. But the current situation is that we do have multiple models (Citaro vs A22, B9TL vs E500 vs A95). Given that situation, it's better to have all operators at least familiar with all the types.</p>
              <p>The problem arises mainly with the DD fleet, where there is a more obvious imbalance. A22s are arguably not a very small minority, but the E500s and A95s each are.</p>

              <p>Give them to SMRT. Take back the BSEP E500 MMCs in return and give them to TT. Any excess B9TLs with TT as a result should then go to GA. Maintain the original arrangement as it was a couple of months back.</p>
