              <p><br> For now, both HGDEP and BBDEP have atleast 3 spare WEGs if not

                  of VO3x going from BNDEP in the current and next month, you will
                  know why they need new WEGs to replace those on sv 9, 19 and

              <p>Also, there will be more registrations next month, so those WEGs
                  can go to HGDEP if they are serious about making 161 WAB

              <p>that the management issue for not buying higher capacity buses. and not that they cant add higher capacity buses (bendies) to these mention services, they can add, but problem is that they do not have the buses at all. how to add?</p>
              <p>I dun see the logic of putting 4 BSEP MAN bus on Sv966  as well while DDs can easily do the work.. If SMRT cant make it, then they should transfer 966/700/190 to SBST... U see what SBST will deploy on these services...</p>

              <p><br>This is the mess with SMRT. More than a year and no decision taken on buying high capacity buses. The areas of BBT, CCK, YIS, WDL have so much more development and population growth but no better service.</p>
              <p>LTA just goes on adding MAN buses. How does it help? Opp direction completely empty. Many times people do not board a SD - the number of pax remaining back is 05-10 pax. For this LTA deploys an additional bus when it could have just deployed DD bus and it would have done the job.</p>
              <p>What I am saying is similar to lemon's point.</p>

              <p>looking at the bendy fleet? and i dun really understand why they have to go buy 200 more MANs.. if BSEP require some buses , 100 MAN should be more than enough.. with the addition 100 MAN buses, they have to scrap early those Lances and Scania (not that they are good buses though)..which results in even higher depreciation/running cost.</p>
              <p>i believe that they are right now in discussion and very high chance, SBST will be running all the bus services in few years time.. there are ppl who suggest tong tar/woodlands transport or other private operators to take over, believe me, they wont be able to make it....</p>

In the past,HGDEP were the one who take in all those new VO3x and transfer out all those old LO3x (and in actual fact HGDEP was the first depot to take in LO3x for Sv7)....</p>

              <p>Actually I can see why they want to replace the Lances early...the PTOs aren't very happy with the limited support Cummins and Alexander-Dennis offers here (if any).</p>
              <p>If there is anything to blame, it was the rather dumb "novelty ala variety-much-much" TIBS approach. It also left SMRT stuck with so many bendies and such locked-in investments can be very painful to execute changes to.</p>
              <p>The private operators might be able to step up to the challenge. But they will need support in many areas.</p>
              <p>It might really just be better to have a single operator that can pool its resources properly island-wide. Sometimes competition may very well be sub-optimal...</p>
              <p>Maybe SMRT might suddenly surprise us with DD purchase. Who knows? </p>
              <p>But its quite pointless to guess. And....to but bluntly, I am not staying in SMRT area. So if SMRT doesnt buy DD, I can't really care less. There are more pressing issues in life that deserve their share of attention already.</p>

              <p>Most probably due to maintenance issues, SBS then want to centralise all Volvos under 1 depot while Merc under another. Unlike nowdays all depots with all types of buses (except for a few like Trident, CNG and VSO).</p>
              <p>It was somehow a good thing that HGDEP transfer out several old VO3x to SLBP for those JIS service replacements.There are some HGDEP services which I think they deserve to go WAB first but is mainly due to the old buses still running around.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I also dun expect the JIS to get massive upgrades and turn WAB so soon (correct me if I am wrong).</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>If I am not wrong in the mid 90s era, it was HGDEP as well as BNDEP/BBDEP that also took in mass intakes of brand new Volvos MK4s. In the end all the older 0405s were thrown over to AMDEP/JRBP.</p>

              <p>Hino also. Whereas Scania and DAFs were just a normal retirement without further extension after running 17 years.</p>
              <p>It seems like SMRT rather extend the 0405s lifespan, instead of letting the Lances and Hinos continue to run on the roads till 2015-2017 while the 0405s go off.</p>
