              <p>Firstly, I am of the opinion that this got something to do with the respective assembly rate of B9TLs and A95s. Given that Hougang Bus Assembly had become familarised with the building of B9TLs, it's unsurprising that they would have produced it at a fast rate, having more than enough B9TLs that not even SBS Transit needs all of them (especially when LTA bought 176 more B9TLs).</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the Batch 3 A95s appeared to have a different exterior design (I have not yet boarded the Batch 3s yet so I don't know about the interior). Furthermore, the A95s aren't assembled in Singapore unlike the B9TLs...for the former, it would definitely takes much more time for them to come as compared to the latter. Given that SMRT needs high capacity buses urgently, they just simply assign all of them to SMRT for now...but whether this means that they would do something to the A95s is still another question to be left to another occasion though.</p>
