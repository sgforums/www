              <p>Are u sure go ahead have lack of SD? SG1030-1050 can be given to
              GA. But instead, they took in 3300-3322 (except 3316/3319). I would
              rather GA took in 1030-1050 n give 3300-3322 to smrt

              <p>I think it deserve to have DDs during the AM peak and lunch time when schools end. It is the scheduler role to ensure that the buses are being allocated at the correct timing. This is just my opinion.</p>
