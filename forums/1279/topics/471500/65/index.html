              <p>A long time ago I have suggested SWT between TM and CBP, with DDs. People werent content ofc, stubborn on wanting DDs to be wasted on the rest of the route.</p>
              <p>These foolish lobbyists sought to fulfill their selfish amusements by continuing to whine and complain, even though it is clear that any action beyond the aforementioned would simply be a waste of resources that could never be justified.</p>

              <p>Bro - 47 is doing quite okay with DDs. You should see the loading during AM towards CBP and PM from CBP. The buses can easily get 80-100 pax, and many times the SD will be in "red". Of course Marine Parade area is too spoilt with too many services and they need to do some rationalization there.</p>
              <p>16, 31, 196, 197 all doing MP - Bedok</p>
              <p>12, 38, 47 - too many services for Bedok South to Tanah Merah.</p>
              <p>But if you just see the load between CBP onwards there is high demand.</p>
              <p><strong>The service which has DDs and totally does not need it is sv 46. </strong></p>
              <p>They can wait until DTL3 to open, witness the loading and then deploy. Talking about excess and waste of resources, I want to highlight that the biggest waste is on feeder/intra-town services where SDs are spammed as if they cost nothing. Whether you take 911, 912, 913 or 222, 291, 293 same story. This is the biggest wastage. And this is LTA decision.</p>

              <p>Which was why I suggested the use of SWT, since 47 DDs run with its top deck practically empty past TM!!! Besides, SWT being routes operated during peak also means that DDs need not be used when CBP itself also does not have demand, i.e. off peak and weekends/PH. It also ensures faster turnaround time, hence better reliability.</p>
              <p>As for 46, oh boy I didnt even see the need for this svc, let alone it using DDs. This svc has the potential to extend further, yet LTA just stopped it in the east. No MRT stations along the way, no heavy loading sectors. </p>

              <p>Hi mr CB2883J, you are right. No need to fight over DDs in 46 and 47. It is very ironical that when new bus services under BSEP are introduced (as in sbs 46 and 47), the main purpose is to serve those areas with slightly much lesser bus services and to bridge some connections (such as bedok north and bedok south in sbs 46 case). Note that loading of the service is not the utmost importance consideration. Do not always go and link to DDs and loading which people always end up quarreling over. Some people observe at this timing and some people observe at other timings. There is also no right and wrong answer. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I don't agree. You can provide new connectivity with sv 46 but can do it will full fleet SD. Of course there is correlation between using DDs and loading on bus services. Who is paying for all this after all? If such routes are loss-making it is going to end up increasing more fares.</p>

              <p>that true...  and right now ,they are paying such a high price for the A95 buses,whereby SMRT themselves are buying 25% cheaper.....</p>
              <p>even for a tender of building bus depots, the contracts were awarded around 9 months later.. same go for the extension of bus interchanges.... </p>
              <p>and for the new concept buses, dun expect them to place order for 1000 buses in one time.. they do not need so many buses right now... the first batch of B9 going to reach 17 years in 2024... same go for the KUB... while SMRT have some bendies to go in the next 1-2 years... and what they are ordering will be to replace these bendies. dun think they will order extra right now, cos most of the routes are running with more than enough buses..</p>
              <p>and are we expecting to pay up to S$700 000 for each concept bus?? </p>

              <p>Clearly all of you have misread my post — the way LTA spends now is treating economies of scale as something invisible... Eg. Wrongful DD deployments, social welfare svcs.</p>
              <p>But I do see truth in LTA's actions... Coz at least they are making bus ops more ex now than drag till later, for spare parts... You cannot deny that there already exists multiple models in SG, and you cant get rid of them... The only thing we can do now is to stop bringing in so many varients and actually deal with the current bunch... I myself are not up for diversity anymore (I used to) since thr release of the concept... Its basically best of both worlds, SBST and SMRT... </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, yes you can continue to link DDs and loading on bus services. However note that this is not the primary aim of introducing BSEP services. They will not downsize the service to every passenger requirements and perceptions. Main aim of public transport is to provide connection even if it is loss-making. Now end up become bus routes and depots tender. Some money making bus services will definitely cover up for some loss-making bus services. This is expected to even out. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I am not absorbed in my fantasies where money falls from the sky. What I am saying that when the new BSEP services are introduced, the authorities do not take loading as main concern. Not the MAIN concern does not imply do not matter at all. It is still a concern but it is given much lesser priority in consideration. Your point of deploying full DDs on 84, 882 do not substantiate any items. </p>
              <p>When new bus services are introduced, do not expect loading to be fantastic. Sbs 116 takes about 2 years in order for its loading to mature. Sbs 386 also takes several months for its loading to reach its current stage. Sbs 117 is still trying to find its passenger loading. Sbs 102 and 324 still have ways to improve. All I am saying is that the main reason of introducing BSEP is not about loading as top priority. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
