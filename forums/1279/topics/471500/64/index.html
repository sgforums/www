              <p>Hi mr TIB868X, don't worry. $3.90 bus fare will not come in our lifetime. The way that it is being controlled now, it will not rise so much. All these are just waylaid predictions. No need to read too much into it. Certainly don't even need to push blame to whatever 70%, bus fans, etc if things do not coincide with your expectations.Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>it's not the economy, it's economies of scale to achieve savings responsibly. got money doesn't mean you can smoke it all, especially taxpayer dollars. anyway it is generally believed GCM will always run at a deficit, aka only survive with govt subsidies. the questions is how much</p>

              <p>I would not want you to be in a position controlling financial matters in the government. Money is not to be spent in that manner and all governments aim for budget surplus, or mininmally, a balanced buget.</p>
              <p>Also, money in the reserve cannot be used for fiscal spending. These are only used for crises or investment. Fiscal spending has to be budgeted.</p>

              <p>I would not want you to be in a position controlling financial
              matters in the government. Money is not to be spent in that manner
              and all governments aim for budget surplus, or mininmally, a
              balanced buget.</p>
              <p>Also, money in the reserve cannot be used for fiscal spending.
              These are only used for crises or investment. Fiscal spending has
              to be budgeted.</p>
