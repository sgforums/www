            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I think you are right. I watched both Channel NewsAsia's and Channel I News' commentaries on this issue. Both said that although liberisation was encouraged in Singapore, the transportation sector is just too small for 2 operators. They suggested some possibilities.<br><br>One was for SBST to sell its rail operations to SMRT, and in return SMRT to sell its bus operations to SBST. Another possibility was what you mentioned, for SMRT and SBST to merge into one giant transportation company.<br><br>Though we've known that SMRT is 'open' to any options or suggestions, we have yet to hear what SBST have to say about this issue.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

The SMRT and SBST own rail lines served different areas in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yet another costly mistake which the people are forced to bear. In my honest opinion, if Singapore were a respectable democracy, the entire ministry of transport would have been booted out long ago.<br><br>However, since ranting does not help much, I am going to offer a solution.<br><br>Firstly, since it is (and continues to be) nonsensical to call the rail lines in Singapore "competition", we might as well scrap the entire idea, and let a government board control the rail lines. NO MARKET OWNERSHIP! Goodness, I was wondering how long it would take them to realise that!<br><br>As for buses, there should not have been such a thing called "strong-hold interchanges" in the first place. It stifles competition, and keeps everyone hanging in between the status of being a market controlled, yet regulated economy (which will never sustain). Cut the cords loose entirely, and sit back and watch them slay each other.<br><br>I am sure that within a few days of reform (yes, a bitter medicine which these behemoths of a GLC need to take, quoting from PM Goh), they would find tons of fluff called "red tape" in their own companies. I can even guarantee it!<br><br>Singapore is too small to allow a "middle-of-nowhere" system of transportation, and really, do the PTC need to worry about there not being enough bus services when complete free competition is not instituted?</div>
