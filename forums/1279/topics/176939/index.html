            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, i don't think the Pininfarina Habit styled Hispano was much more expensive than the normal Hispano version. This Pininfarina also did styling on relatively cheap cars like the sub-compact Hyundai Matrix among others &amp; these didn't cost that much more than the 'regular' models from the same vehicle makers.<br><br>I'll say the expensive part is more with the physical, structural, functional, technological rather than the aesthetical aspects. In that sense, the Habit used a more advanced version of the O 405 G versus the earlier regular Hispano<br>so i'll attribute any cost increases as mainly due to the bus chassis part instead of the bodywork.<br><br>In the case of the M-B CapaCity, based on what i have 'sensed' so far, this model should be even more sophisicated in both aesthetics &amp; the other aspects mentioned above, so should be even more expensive overall. I don't think the CapaCity would have a chassis (in the normal sense of expectation in view of the very low expected floor height) as i'll expect it to be built on a monocoque platform concept, with it's many more load bearing structures (hence complexity) than a more straight forward 'normal' type of higher height bus-chassis design.<br><br>As for copying the mere looks of this new styling, as long as M-B does not bother to put any copyright on their original bodywork designs, i won't be surprised quite soon there be quite some 'agar-agar &amp; rojak'' lookalikes emerging on the local scene using 'normal' 2-axle bus-chassi ! The 'looks' part almost always seems cheap to copy but the technological part especially would tend to be too expensive &amp; even beyond their capabilties to copy !!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eX.A.K.R.:</div><div class="quote_body">Sadly, the year when we get these buses in Singapore will be the year 2046, when A$$MRT is long swallowed up by SBS Transit...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seriously, though, I think A$$MRT is more interested in uselessly beautiful and expensive designer buses (Habits, anyone?), rather than these really useful <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> beautiful buses.<br><br>My first impression when I saw this bus was a bus designed for the city of the future.

            <div class='col-md body'>w/o a doubt, it is longer. i think our bendies are only up to the 4th axle if we look at the CapaCity. with 2 doors at the trailer, i think it would encourage more to move to the trailer when the bus is crowded. have you guys seen the seating arrangement? it's very nice.</div>
