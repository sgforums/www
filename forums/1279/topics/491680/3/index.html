              <p>Reliability concerns, jumpbus looks better on paper, ie in an ideal situation where there isn't any events on the road that will delay the buses. However, given that there are so many vehicles and traffic lights on the road, and potential incidents and breakdowns (whether of the bus itself or other vehicles), plus the fact that population is ageing and the fact that wheelchair users can now take the bus, which adds more than 1 min for each boarding/alighting), buses are now more likely to be delayed than before. With this, it is going to be problematic operational wise as it requires the buses to be back at the interchange before the next departure, even though the drivers taking over are ready to go.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>No, I'm not saying that when there is no jump bus, buses will definitely depart on time. What I am saying is, in a situation where there is adverse traffic conditions causing delays, jump bus is subjected to more issues. You will have less resources to work with, and passengers will face longer delays than not having jumpbus. In a non jumpbus situation, the drivers will always have a bus to drive for sure, which means the interchange staff can exercise more flexbility in deploying the bus by adjusting the schedules to deal with any delays.</p>
              <p>In a jumpbus situation, you may have the driver, but if the bus isn't there, there is basically nothing much you can do, except for using buses (and drivers) from other services to cover for missing trips, but this is just trying to cover a hole by digging another hole, there will be impacts on the other services that the resources are coming from. The fact that QOS standards have been made more stringent and the introduction of BSRF means that the disadvantages of jumpbus are amplified, it is now harder to grab any other bus at the terminals while trying to meet QOS/BSRF standards for the services you are grabiing the buses from.</p>
              <p>Jumpbus therefore creates more complexity to operations staff, who already have an heavy workload. This is why it is not as prevalent as before. </p>

              <p>Yes that's exactly why I asked about jump bus. Looking at how interchanges are getting stuffed with new services without expansion in parking bays, I think jump bus may actually work better (eg: CCK). </p>
              <p>Have the BC ready... and instead of 4 sv 190 parking at CCK, you can make it 3 sv 190. Likewise for other services like 300/302/983 with fast turnover at interchange. </p>

              <p>No, I'm not saying that when there is no jump bus, buses will
              definitely depart on time. What I am saying is, in a situation
              where there is adverse traffic conditions causing delays, jump bus
              is subjected to more issues. You will have less resources to work
              with, and passengers will face longer delays than not having
              jumpbus. In a non jumpbus situation, the drivers will always have a
              bus to drive for sure, which means the interchange staff can
              exercise more flexbility in deploying the bus by adjusting the
              schedules to deal with any delays.</p>
              <p>In a jumpbus situation, you may have the driver, but if the bus
              isn't there, there is basically nothing much you can do, except for
              using buses (and drivers) from other services to cover for missing
              trips, but this is just trying to cover a hole by digging another
              hole, there will be impacts on the other services that the
              resources are coming from. The fact that QOS standards have been
              made more stringent and the introduction of BSRF means that the
              disadvantages of jumpbus are amplified, it is now harder to grab
              any other bus at the terminals while trying to meet QOS/BSRF
              standards for the services you are grabiing the buses from.</p>
              <p>Jumpbus therefore creates more complexity to operations staff,
              who already have an heavy workload. This is why it is not as
              prevalent as before. </p>
