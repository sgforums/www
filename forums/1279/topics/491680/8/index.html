              <p>Secondly, speedometers in SG are ridiculously set at 60kmh, too slow for buses to operate, especially those plying expy. This not only slows down travel time, but also harms the bus itself and causes inconvenience to other road users (minor extent). Rising it to 70kmh would have been more reasonable. Everyone knows they are for safety but is increasing it by 10kmh gonna suddenly result in road disasters? Maybe you would think so, haha</p>

              <p>Firstly, nobody understands your question, and I'm guessing it's
              irrelevant or even discriminatory, so keep it to yourself yea?</p>
              <p>Secondly, speedometers in SG are ridiculously set at 60kmh, too
              slow for buses to operate, especially those plying expy. This not
              only slows down travel time, but also harms the bus itself and
              causes inconvenience to other road users (minor extent). Rising it
              to 70kmh would have been more reasonable. Everyone knows they are
              for safety but is increasing it by 10kmh gonna suddenly result in
              road disasters? Maybe you would think so, haha</p>

              <p>Second that,Or at least between 62-65kmh is enough...Am i asking too much?</p>

              <p>I would love bus 506 to go faster as much as you do. But do you know what is the process of getting the speed limit raised? Clue: it is not going to the LTA.</p>
              <p>If you have given this a little thought, you would know that it is almost impossible. With GCM/BCM, the average speed of buses is going down further.</p>
              <p>I am offering a viable alternative for those who wants that speed rush. Rather than bus lobbyists trying to have the driver push for 80km/h in Singapore and risk safety and legal consequences, why not hop on an Australian bus which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldr0uDRtq28">capable of doing that legally for up to 100km/h</a>?</p>

              <p>Edit: video watched. Okay sure, I choose to buy your logic, even though I find the experiment in the video pretty unrealistic (in terms of the braking and the 30kmh thing), which is understandable due to it being advocating for its cause.Â </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I can now see why increasing limit may seem a problem for people: most of our buses run on roads littered with junctions, not expy. Hence higher likelihood of hitting people and stuff. And I will not disagree.Â </p>
              <p>But this is another problem isnt it. If we STILL insists on our buses plying so many damn stops and passing through every busy road, not only are our bus routes getting winding, buses are also not travelling fast, even pulling down those ALREADY express with them! So if the hub-and-spoke model is still gonna be stubbornly used, our buses are just gonna stop more and travel slower. In this case LTA has already failed in its cause: to get more car owners to ride the PT.</p>
