              <p>Then why did they order the E500s in the first place? Should have directly gone in for MANA95s since they already do MANA22s. Could have converted order of A22 to A95 much early on. </p>

              <p>Agree with you. Some more have so many non-WAB bendies yet do not give services like 187 more bendies, but keep spamming A22s and increase # buses from 24 to 31 buses. Then how do you expect your depots to have space??!?! </p>

              <p>Its because of the first offer,After a while MAN produce a RHD custom A39(13.7m to 12m)..If MAN offer those A95 i would think ADL wouldnt stand a chance.</p>

              <p>Like how?</p>
              <p>If there is major feeder revamp, you don't think people will shout and cry. I do feel that for some services there is scope to revamp but won't happen so easily.</p>
              <p>SMRT wanted to give bendies to feeders/intra-towns. Slowly converted all bendy services to majority rigids because of its "rigid" behavior to not deploy DDs.</p>
              <p>It is so mindless that they just go on adding A22s as they are not able to cope with the loading. </p>
