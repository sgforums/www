              <p>No, I'm not saying that when there is no jump bus, buses will
              definitely depart on time. What I am saying is, in a situation
              where there is adverse traffic conditions causing delays, jump bus
              is subjected to more issues. You will have less resources to work
              with, and passengers will face longer delays than not having
              jumpbus. In a non jumpbus situation, the drivers will always have a
              bus to drive for sure, which means the interchange staff can
              exercise more flexbility in deploying the bus by adjusting the
              schedules to deal with any delays.</p>
              <p>In a jumpbus situation, you may have the driver, but if the bus
              isn't there, there is basically nothing much you can do, except for
              using buses (and drivers) from other services to cover for missing
              trips, but this is just trying to cover a hole by digging another
              hole, there will be impacts on the other services that the
              resources are coming from. The fact that QOS standards have been
              made more stringent and the introduction of BSRF means that the
              disadvantages of jumpbus are amplified, it is now harder to grab
              any other bus at the terminals while trying to meet QOS/BSRF
              standards for the services you are grabiing the buses from.</p>
              <p>Jumpbus therefore creates more complexity to operations staff,
              who already have an heavy workload. This is why it is not as
              prevalent as before. </p>

              <p>during adverse conditions,  what is the point of having the bus/driver together, when they are stuck in traffic.. it is still the same... further, when the bus came back late, u cant immediately depart,cos the BC need to rest...esp for those long haul trips..not sure what flexibility that the bus interchange staff can have?  might not even able to find a BC who can drive that particular service even if u have other buses in the interchange to use...</p>
              <p>while at least for jump buses, the BC can have some rest, even if he is late. and the BC at the interchange/terminal can also use another bus to start trip.. not sure what u mean by digging the hole bigger... the next bus that came back (can be any service) can simply replace the earlier bus that is taken from another service esp when u have few services in the same terminal/interchange (and they are from same depot)..  (if u look at YCK terminal deployment, they are very flexible on the allocation of buses within sv13/70/72/76/162). one service got delay, they will use another service bus to cover...</p>
              <p>and with BSRF, the interchange staff/control room staff are suppose to regulate the frequency by taking and deploying buses from elsewhere if there is adverse traffic condition.. so not sure why you are saying that jump bus will affect BSRF? whereby it is adverse traffic condition which will advise BSRF?</p>

              <p>One service got delay, use another, and in the end you will end up with a situation of lack of operational discipline, ie staff using whatever resources they can grab at any time. What will happen is, because A has a gap, we use B's bus, then if B has a gap due to this, we use C, and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Operationally, any pullover that staff perform currently, after the bus finishes helping the affected service, the staff will have to perform recovery, ie getting the duties as close back to their schedules as possible so as to make it easier to monitor the services and also to avoid incurring OT costs. In your style of operations, this becomes harder to perform as you may have a lot more buses out of sync from their duties. And then you may have instances where because of pulling over buses from other services, high capacity buses and normal buses are not where they are needed based on their actual schedules. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">And your assumption is that only the jumpbus service has been delayed by enroute conditions, when a lot of times, this happens together with delays to other non jumpbus services, where then do you get your bus, especially when these other services will also need buses themselves.</span></p>
              <p>It is better for you to have a bus in the interchange on the assigned schedules than to be left with no bus to deploy, even though there is a driver. Since BSRF already requires buses to be pulled over if the services are to be maintained, wouldn't it be better to have more buses at hand than having less buses at hand? </p>
              <p>Therefore jumpbus works well only if the service is reliable, and free from heavy loadings most of the time.</p>
              <p>Jumpbus also means that buses get lesser time of inactivity than non jumpbus, meaning buses work harder under under jumpbus than without jumpbus, and this means maintenance costs will increase. Yes it may seem to be just around 10 mins more per mealbreak, but these will add up over time.</p>
              <p>If jumpbus was so good, why isn't it as pervalent as before? Or is it that you know bus operations better than SBS who have been cutting down on this over the past 10 odd years?</p>

              <p>All routes under GCM are also under BSRF. There will no more pulling of buses and certain routes taking greater priority over others. There is a very good reason why new operators claim to be providing extra buses (clue: it has nothing to do with generosity).</p>
              <p>Jumpbus exists due to parking constrains or fleet shortage (for lack of capital). If there were no issues with parking or buying enough buses, at this day and age no operator would really want to operate jumpbus.</p>
              <p>I have seen stranger rostering and timetabling at work in Australia. Let's see what happens when GCM starts.</p>

              <p>One service got delay, use another, and in the end you will end
              up with a situation of lack of operational discipline, ie staff
              using whatever resources they can grab at any time. What will
              happen is, because A has a gap, we use B's bus, then if B has a gap
              due to this, we use C, and so on and so forth.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Operationally, any pullover
              that staff perform currently, after the bus finishes helping the
              affected service, the staff will have to perform recovery, ie
              getting the duties as close back to their schedules as possible so
              as to make it easier to monitor the services and also to avoid
              incurring OT costs. In your style of operations, this becomes
              harder to perform as you may have a lot more buses out of sync from
              their duties. And then you may have instances where because of
              pulling over buses from other services, high capacity buses and
              normal buses are not where they are needed based on their actual
              schedules. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">And your assumption is that
              only the jumpbus service has been delayed by enroute conditions,
              when a lot of times, this happens together with delays to other non
              jumpbus services, where then do you get your bus, especially when
              these other services will also need buses themselves.</span></p>
              <p>It is better for you to have a bus in the interchange on the
              assigned schedules than to be left with no bus to deploy, even
              though there is a driver. Since BSRF already requires buses to be
              pulled over if the services are to be maintained, wouldn't it be
              better to have more buses at hand than having less buses at
              hand? </p>
              <p>Therefore jumpbus works well only if the service is reliable,
              and free from heavy loadings most of the time.</p>
              <p>Jumpbus also means that buses get lesser time of inactivity than
              non jumpbus, meaning buses work harder under under jumpbus than
              without jumpbus, and this means maintenance costs will increase.
              Yes it may seem to be just around 10 mins more per mealbreak, but
              these will add up over time.</p>
              <p>If jumpbus was so good, why isn't it as pervalent as before? Or
              is it that you know bus operations better than SBS who have been
              cutting down on this over the past 10 odd years?</p>

              <p>it is better to use available bus on hand to run the trip, rather than letting the next bus came in 30 mins time to pick up right? so if there is this jumpbus service and the BC is already waiting at the terminal for the next bus to came back.. but the next bus stuck in jam for 30 mins and wont be back after 30 mins,and at the same time, there are buses from other services in the terminal which can use immediately to start trip...</p>
              <p>so what will you do? ask the BC to continue to wait till his bus came back 30 mins later then start journey or grab a bus in the terminal and start trip at the schedule timing? imagine u r the one at the bus stop waiting for the bus to come, but due to the traffic condition, the next bus will depart 30 mins, you will sure complain..</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Funny, you are the one who say that jumpbus services are having more issue during adverse traffic conditions, but when i pointed out that non-jumpbus services are subject to same adverse traffic condition, u keep quiet and now instead say that pulling of buses from other services will results in big gap? there wont be so big gap, cos if there is big delay (let say 1 hr) for the buses coming back, the staff would have ask the depot to send in some extra buses or use certain off service buses (depending on the timing). </span></p>
              <p>even for non-jump bus services, they can also pull bus over from other services , provided that there are BCs available who know the route...as for the deploying of DD/SD,in such situation, why care so much as long as there are buses available and BC is able to use it... still want to think think think? need to be flexible in such situation. </p>
              <p>maintainance cost increased due to buses never rest? the buses are build to last for long operation hours...U use one more bus and remove jump bus the cost will also be higher?? </p>
              <p>there were much jumpbus in the past, because SBST did not want to spend money to buy more buses at their cost and there are concern over the parking space (at terminal/depots) as well.   they are a profit orientated company.. of course, they will try to save on cost and use less buses if possible... </p>
              <p>nowadays,with the help of LTA/BSEP, they have already injected many buses, thus lesser need for jumpbus operation (but they stll practise for certain services due to the lack of parking space at terminal) and further jumpbus are applicable for single depots controlled services, thus not all services qualified  as well. </p>

              <p>WLDEP has added 2 rigid buses on 962 fleet on 25092015 Friday.. One of which is covering up the 962A crossover slot (from 960), followed by a 2 mins wait till another 962 rigid bus departs..<br><br>That 962A slot is usually the "scapegoat" after the 10+mins of waiting time, resulting in the back bus (SMB1385T iirc) to bunch up (departed from the int after 3 mins)..</p>

              <p>1. Will bus service information (routes, freq etc) be available on the company websites? Though it is also available on transitlink/ MyTransport.sg, I believe many commuters also refer to SBST/SMRT websites currently.</p>
              <p>2. Will the new buses under TT/GA all have the new green livery from the first day of service? Some have already been restickered, but there may be confusion if buses operated by TT/GA still have the old SBST/SMRT livery.</p>
              <p>3. Will bus service information at bus stops and interchanges be updated? On bus stop poles and bus svc info panels, SBST svcs are shown in red and SMRT svcs in grey, but it may be quite impractical to stick to this convention if bus svcs keep changing operators. </p>
