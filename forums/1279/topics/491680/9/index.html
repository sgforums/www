              <p>Indeed. A bus is only as safe as the driver is. No amount of speed limiters or torque restrictions will prevent an unsafe driver from getting into accidents.</p>

              <p>This is a particularly problematic area. When there is a shortage of drivers, operators can't really pick and choose (other than excluding those who are known to have poor safety records). Some drivers take on the job because it is their only means of earning a living.</p>

              <p>Edit: video watched. Okay sure, I choose to buy your logic, even
                  though I find the experiment in the video pretty unrealistic (in
                  terms of the braking and the 30kmh thing), which is understandable
                  due to it being advocating for its cause. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I can now see why increasing limit may seem a
                  problem for people: most of our buses run on roads littered with
                  junctions, not expy. Hence higher likelihood of hitting people and
                  stuff. And I will not disagree. </p>
              <p>But this is another problem isnt it. If we STILL insists on our
                  buses plying so many damn stops and passing through every busy
                  road, not only are our bus routes getting winding, buses are also
                  not travelling fast, even pulling down those ALREADY express with
                  them! So if the hub-and-spoke model is still gonna be stubbornly
                  used, our buses are just gonna stop more and travel slower. In this
                  case LTA has already failed in its cause: to get more car owners to
                  ride the PT.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>This is a legacy issue I would really want LTA to address in the long run. Many existing routes are designated for maximum catchment, a mentality that works when the fare box is the operator's main concern. We have switched to a distance-based fare but the routes remain winding and anarchic.</p>
              <p>One possibility is to redesign the network to allow for more express routing. I quite like the limited stops idea used in Adelaide (though a bit complex). And dedicate new buses that has seat belts for every seat for such express routes. The latter, if implemented, would be a very strong argument to convince TP to raise speed limit for public buses.</p>

              <p>Exactly right. Since some are from the incumbents the problem of new routes should be fairly minimal. Thanks for pointing THAT out! </p>
              <p>Never have I asked for the driving habits to change overnight. Training takes time, I know that. But eventually, it has to take place what. We cannot always implement short-sighted policies to solve problems that wouldnt work in the long run! Sure we can use it for stop-gap, but definitely not as means of evasion! </p>
              <p>10 years?! A driver needs 10 bloody years to familiarise?! I really must personally meet him man. 10 years isnt short you know, now not only are buses capped at a ridiculous 60kmh, they are FURTHER restrained from even hitting that speed! LTA can say goodbye to their "carefree coz we're car-free" gimmick!</p>

              <p>The SBS livery shown there is a BBDEP repaint around 2005. The window line had been painted black (similar to the CAC buses), all badges removed and the old SBS logo removed. The CAC buses in bbdep also received this treatment, but its not easy to differentiate those from the Mk2s from other depots as the only way to identify them was missing badges and missing logo. All buses subsequently received the SBS Transit livery, leaving SBS210L as the only bus left in the old SBS livery.</p>
