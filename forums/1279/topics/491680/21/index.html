              <p>I kinda agree. Demand requires high-capacity buses. But don't you think full rojak B9TL fleet is cancer? At least mix B9TL/Enviro/A95. </p>

              <p>Generally 180 has moderate to high demand throughout the day,
              best not to put rigids. Bendies can board and alight faster esp at
              Bt Panjang, but cause jam at the temp bus stop beside the lrt,
              although situation shld improve when bus int opens. DDs still ok
              now since mostly long distance travellers, but likely to have more
              boarding/alighting along bt batok in future when the new flats are
              ready. </p>
              <p>My preference: 3 door DD &gt;&gt; bendy &gt;&gt; B9TL &gt;&gt;

                                                          <p>:. $23 per kilometre, in 2013 prices.</p>
                                                          <p>Factor in 2% inflation over four years from 2013 to 2017, the cost of running a bus service should be around $25 per kilometre this year (23 x 1.02 x 1.02 x 1.02 x 1.02).</p>
                                                          
                                                          <p> </p>
                                                  <p>$559.35 per trip (during Comfort Delgro's time), when the fare is only $2.47 and the bus is the standard 40-seater. The bus had only about 20 people per trip. Revenue only $49.40. Even if full house (40 pax), the most is only $98.80 of revenue collected. Can only recover up to 17% of the costs.</p> 
                                              
                                              <p>Hopefully the new operator for city direct 651, Rui Feng, had asked for a lower cost price when they bid for the contract.</p>
                                              
                                              <p>Anyway, this means that if the bus fares were really set at market prices, we could be paying six times the amount of bus fare we are paying now! (100 / 17 = 5.88)</p>
                                          
                                          <p>(Or to make it simple, the transport fares multiply by six.)</p>
                                          <p> </p>
                                          <p>$439.20 on public transport every month, anyone?</p>
                              <p>For a low income person, earning $2000 a month, that's 22% of his monthly salary.</p>
                              <p>For a high income person, earning $5000 a month, that's 9% of his monthly salary.</p>
                              <p>Thankfully, the government collects progressive tax, where the rich pays more, poor pays less.</p>
                          <p> </p>
                          <p>Or at least make a few categories of bus service charge market prices, such as express bus, city direct bus and night owl.</p>
              <p>because anyway, even if charge $16.20 for a ride on express bus service, it's still cheaper than taxi, by around 50%. Not to mention midnight got 50% surcharge. So, why not charge market prices for these type of bus services, to reduce the amount of subsidy on public transport? (as long as night owl don't charge midnight surcharge) #justsaying</p>

              <p>Anyway, if let's say the cost of running a bus route is $25 per kilometre, and the government subsidise 80%, for a bus service to have "healthy loading", it should collect $5 of revenue per kilometre.</p>

              <p>The government, on average, subsidizes at least 55 cents per trip (including transfers and feeders).</p>
              <p>Before 2015, the average bus fare was usually the minimum bus fare. Today's minimum bus fare (card) is currently at 77 cents.</p>
              <p>Based on these two figures, the break even fare (or actual cost of bus operation) for each passenger (including transfers and feeders) is around $1.30 per trip.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind though, some feeder transfers can be as low as 0 to 3 cents, so an average bus only journey might in fact be 50% to double to operate (assuming quarter to half are MRT to feeder transfers). It is possible the average bus only journey costs around $2.00 per trip.</p>
