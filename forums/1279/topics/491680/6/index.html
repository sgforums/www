              <p>Maybe because my niece Chloe took with my brother to my house (or take sister-in-law as we want to watch movies), therefore 8 and 23 was eliminated, and becoming WAB was not a panacea. 81 was the last end-on berth service to be WAB, the later is on 21 May 2016. So for Tampines, this only leaves 10e (external) &amp; 37. 81 is the one who wanted but ended up don't want, so waited until 21 May 2016.</p>
              <p>160 &amp; 170 is the same. The PIWs can go to Johor Bahru, but those youngsters are usually a joke, can only limit to Woodlands Train Checkpoint bus stop (160, 170) / Woodlands Town Garden bus stop (950).</p>
              <p>I am sure 160, 170 &amp; 950 has PIWs that can go to Johor Bahru, including those stepless buses. PIWs can only be carried by parents / or mature adults. Only the youngsters will sure get "robbed", including their life.</p>
              <p>401 is WAB since 21 May 2016, ever since I saw a bus with the wheelchair logo. That means nearly all SBS Transit routes became WAB, except for rare occasions. Maybe when I buy a Digital TV set-top box, then all become WAB.</p>
              <p>SMRT - I dunno. It will take forever to become WAB.</p>

              <p>Bedok North St 3 is a difficult case unless a service is routed inside, but that would probably end up making 225G redundant. A last resort would be to construct bus stops along PIE and send over some services.</p>
              <p>Bedok North Rd (Blk 414/428 bus stops) could benefit with a small extension of 87 over there and Bedok North Ave 2, or otherwise a reroute of 228.</p>
              <p>A new HGDEP - Bedok North - Bedok - UEC - Bedok South loop service could be introduced to provide DTL3 link to Bedok North MRT. This would allow 14 to be shortened (with its loop around eastern Bedok replaced by the new service) to improve its reliability.</p>
              <p>A service tracing 229's route, with its north end linking Bedok North MRT, could help to complement the above service at Bedok South Rd. (Bedok South has 506, but would definitely need a standalone trunk service to DTL3)</p>
              <p>Agree that 17A could be used to bridge the link to DTL3.</p>
              <p>18 needs to be properly enhanced to serve its full potential.</p>

              <p>I actually wonder why DTL stations are made to be very close to one another. Its like, you are taking a train from Kaki Bukit to Bedok North and it only takes a mere 15 seconds. I know because I estimated the distance and its only 3 bus stops from Kaki Bukit. There are so many bus services going there. Demand is one thing. However, I also thought why cant people just take buses instead. Its not like each of them is of inconsistent frequency and every bus packed to the doors.</p>
              <p>Maybe 60 can be amended to serve the extended plan too. Like that, its route purpose can be fully utilised</p>

              <p>15 sec ? u sure? 3 bus stop distance is quite far away..</p>
              <p>ppl will take from Bedok North to other stations, not just kaki bukit.. further there are paxes at Kaki Bukit as well.. if u dun built a station there, then the paxes must go to bedok north to take? </p>

              <p>I only said its an estimation. Even if its not right the journey would be less than a minute.</p>
              <p>From what I seen, Bedok Reservoir is a smaller town compared to other towns such as Bedok. I can accept that towns such as Yishun get 2 MRT stations because the town is larger than Bedok Reservoir. However, I am confused of how small towns can even have 2 stations too when the proportion of residents living in Yishun to those living in Bedok Reservoir is very comparable. This also goes the same to some stations along DTL. I noticed that King Albert Park station is very empty. Less than 10 passengers boarded the trains and almost no one alighted here. At Bedok North MRT &amp; Kaki Bukit MRT, there is more than 1 service going towards Tampines. If not, there are 10 more services going to various destinations. T<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">here has also been predictions that one of them may be under-utilised upon opening of the station.</span></p>
              <p>I dont really go to Bedok Reservoir as I am not a resident here. However, if anyone knows the pattern, I would be glad to know so that I can understand the reason why everything is like this</p>

              <p>When Downtown Line stage three opens, I hope there can be a bus connection between Kaki Bukit MRT Station and Telok Kurau Primary School area, either by introducing new routes or changing existing one.</p>
              
              <p>I am okay with changing route 21 to meander through Kaki Bukit MRT Station since it is only used to get from Eunos MRT (Sims Avenue) to Telok Kurau area, but please keep route 60 as it is, to provide the direct connection to Eunos MRT Station.</p>
              
              <p>If the length is not an issue, we can extend feeder route 228 from Bedok Reservoir Road looping point to Kaki Bukit Avenue 1, via Jalan Damai. It can return via Jalan Tenaga.</p>

              <p>TT or GA only offer to those affected bus service perm BC but they can chose to stay with their company to drive other service or become a standby BC.I knew a few ex BBT SMRT BCs went over to CCK/BPJ and some even lucky to get a slot into svc 61.</p>
