              <p>Buying more A95s is even more compelling considering all the MANs and Gemilangs we have hre. Sure ADL got plants and spare parts all over Asia for maintenance but its not like SMRT is going to bother maintaining them. Look at the sorry state of our ADLs. Brand new, they're already rattling and now their radiators sound worse than the Euro III B9TLs. </p>

              <p>I was only kidding. And nope. I am also unsure as to the exact quantities of MAN A22s ordered. To some degree there has been a lack of transparency. On the current SG-plated MAN A95s, as far as I know I haven't seen a public tender for it. I would appreciate if anyone could confirm or deny this. Could it have been SMRT orders taken on by LTA? If so, it has been omitted from public knowledge. Seems rather arcane to me.</p>

              <p>The tender for the concept bus would be hapenning nearer to the end of this year.</p>

              <p>Like how?</p>
              <p>If there is major feeder revamp, you don't think people will
              shout and cry. I do feel that for some services there is scope to
              revamp but won't happen so easily.</p>
              <p>SMRT wanted to give bendies to feeders/intra-towns. Slowly
              converted all bendy services to majority rigids because of its
              "rigid" behavior to not deploy DDs.</p>

              <p>This reply is a summary of my post from the old thread.</p>
              <p>This is why having more feeders per residential town is not the best idea when it comes to bus service planning, especially if the bus services in the residential town are managed by SMRT under its "bendies for feeders/intra-towns" policy. More feeders for the residential town may therefore indirectly translate to the need for more articulated buses or spammage of single-deck buses to cope with the potential high demands for these new feeder services.</p>
              <p>Only 2 ways are able to tackle the issue, either by deploying double-deck buses in place of articulated buses for feeders as well OR having more inter-town trunk services that can utilize double-deck buses more efficiently instead of more feeder services per residential town.</p>

              <p>In their statements they might consider three doors single deckers in future.They really love to try Europe style.As for now i hope they can consider low entry single deckers to supplement fleet restriction service like 15,34,36 &amp; 77 etc.SBST got K230UBs and SMRT got OC500LEs.There is also a new Euro IV OC500LE 7700cc 299hp/1200nm,Volvo B8RLE 280hp/1050nm or Citaro LE.</p>
