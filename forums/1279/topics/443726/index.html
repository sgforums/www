              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I have an equiry to ask all of you. Do you all know if all the Bus in Singapore have a sensor that can indicate the door to not close if there are people still exiting the bus while they are still in between the door?</p>
              <p>especially I want to know if SBS Transit Bus Vovlo has it.</p>
              <p>That is because, yesterday I was taking Bus 103 licence number SBS939, the bus driver keep stepping on engine while it is already very near the bus stops and do jam breaks at every bus stop. As I was standing near the exit of the door trying to keep myself stablized and was very wary if I will unable to balance myself while standing. was questioning if the bus have problem or the bus driver problem...</p>
              <p>When I was going to alight at the third stop (Boundary Road right after Paya Lebar Methodist Church) from Serangoon Interchange (exclude as count of 1), I actually forget to scan card and tried to get back on bus but still have people alighting. I was also told off by my boyfriend that if I go back like this, I might get him killed as the bus driver might not be aware of whats happening and just close the door and speed off.</p>
              <p>Please if you can answer my query, does all the Bus in Singapore have a sensor that can indicate the door to not close if there are people still exiting the bus while they are still in between the door? Thanks</p>

              <p>@sbst275 : its not about the safety part when alighting, the perception given was that the bus driver or the bus is having a problem with the jam breaks.</p>
              <p>@Y_Shun : thanks for clarifing but does it not work often? In this case nothing major happened, but what if the driver really does close the door and the door did not close and my boyfriend on the staircase exit and I'm halfway up the staircase. Such accident will happen when the driver speed off without noticing and the perception is it will as the driver is rather reckless in the driving. or are they not properly trained to use the bus itself.</p>

              <p>There's two mechanism to prevent this from happening, the Door Interlocks prevents the bus from moving faster than a certain speed (about 10km/h) if the doors are not closed properly. The newer systems even prevents the vehicle from moving on some newer buses.</p>
              <p>The other mechansim is as per Y_Shun mentioned, it's an exit sensor placed above the door that detects if there's any obstacles at the exit. However because the sensor is meant to detect if anyone is exiting, its unlikely able to detect if u have an arm or a leg stuck between the doors, making it very dangerous as the doors are still indicated as closed to the drivers. Newer buses have more exit sensors to detect from left, right and above, and also sensors on the door to detect if the doors hit any objects.</p>
              <p>But most importantly, the priority is to try to be safe yourself as we can never know when these mechanisms fail due to whatever reasons. The additional tens of cents is probably not worth exhanging your life for, especially so since u took the time to write here.</p>
              <p>Cheers :)</p>

              <p>I see, thats good to know, thanks. Most of the newer buses with bus stop brakes (press a button to hold the bus w/o using handbrakes) should have the newer interlocks.</p>
