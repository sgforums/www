            <div class='col-md body'>Quite simple answer to me !<br>Because besides bicycle, motorcycle &amp; car (in that order) buses are the next closest form of passenger transport to exist !!<br><br>Furthermore, in some models of buses i can 'see' some 'parallels' to some models of cars in terms of engine 'feel' &amp; the overall class of travelling experience ! I can associate a MAN bus with a BMW car in some (perhaps unusual) ways &amp; of course an M-B V8-engined bus with an M-B S-Class car likewise etc. so that when the car's not available there's the bus as some approximate replacement !!<br><br>However i cannot sense much similar 'associations' when comparing with trains, planes or ships. So to me that's the point about all the interest in buses.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by huaqing:</div><div class="quote_body">newbie here.<br><br>just wondering, why are ppl interested in buses ar?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally drive and ride. Occasionally take bus not only becos its free for me, but becos I need to understand how it feels like to be a passenger in order for me to serve my customers better. I also play in the racetrack on sportsbike in the Johor Circuit. Enjoy technical hands on in the workshop level. I choosed this line because of my desire in automotives. My company also deals with civilian cars. But what I can say is that a bus has a much more complicated and advanced system compared to many cars. Those who used to do cars had problem adapting to the bus workshop where demands are much higher. Although I have mechanics who left the company to do cars. I also have pple who left doing cars to do bus. Even if so, our mechanics are mostly long service personnel. Staff turnover rate is extremely slow. It was only due to the recent aggressive movement by Comfortdelgro that the company has to recruit more professionals to take on the challenge for the future. At the same time hunt for new blood to take over the helm when the older staffs leave. This is also due to good company policies in dealing with staffs. In SBST, I have seen people who worked till the day they die in the work due to old age or illness. They don't want to leave the company until they die. 1 old mechanic was pushing the trolley in Bukit Batok workshop then he suddenly collasped and died. He was over 60. Previous AMK workshop manager was a caucasian called Glenn. He also died due to health problems at old age. These are examples of people who loved the company so much that they'd rather die here than die at home a lonely man.<br><br>Both the cars and buses are different type of vehicles yet they share many similarities too. I was initially shocked to find that there're pple who are crazy about buses. And was pleasantly surprised to see that the hardwork my workshop have put in are not gone unrecognised.<br><br>Public transport need to exist as the country need to maintain the viscousity of the public movement. As some may not want to buy a personal transport or unable to buy. Eg. financial problems, disabled pple etc. And buses form a good part in maintaining the movement of these pple.<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me the ultimate bus would be in coach form with 16-litre V8 charge-cooled diesel to Euro-4 or 5 with SCR @ 600 BHP &amp; 2000 Nm no road speed limitation with full engine &amp; transmission encapulation, all round full independent air-suspension with ABS, ASR, dynamic automatic 'real time' fine tuning of suspension damping / tyre pressures with electronic drawbar. Full leather interior with burr walnut woodgrain dashboard &amp; panelling etc. With bed, kitchen &amp; washing machine in the rear ! No way a car has the space or technical capability to support so many gadgets so well.<br><br>Result: like riding on air inside a noiseless air-tight bank vault @ 3-figure speeds on a highway with plenty of space to walk about &amp; things to do ! Compared to a car where one's mostly strapped to their seats no space to move ! Can drive even around the world no need bother about hotels. No way a car (not even a 'stretched' limosine) can offer all that just as well !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SBS9828X:</div><div class="quote_body">id prove u wrong after i install some after market parts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>turbo charger<br>super charger<br>DOHC<br>rear VTEC engine  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>boi86's evo9 spoiler<br>front mounted intercooler<br>lowered suspension<br>nitro boost<br>all new bodykit by Hougang R  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>new SFX plate<br>and a SLR front engine<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting narration !<br><br>I agree that the systems on buses can be somewhat more complicated &amp; advanced than on cars. The push-button type of automatic gear changing system e.g. has been on buses for the past 20+ years yet it seems that other than Rolls-Royce (which may have offered it on their cars only to later to remove it ?) no car seems to have a similar system even today ? In cars they still use 'the stick' to select gear, even in automatic transmissions ! I'll rather just press buttons instead !<br><br>So you're workshop boss @ Delgro ?? But from your profile you indicate 'armed forces' ?? If so then what customers you serve ?!? Sounds confusing &amp; 'contradictory' to me. Those long serving staff you mentioned, i believe the company has become an integral part of their lives that it's only 'natural' that they never pass a day without the company ! I'll say it's not just in the monetary compensation but that they simply don't have a clue what else to do if they leave the company ?!? So the company is like family to them so no surprise they stick there till the end of their days !<br><br>Despite the (projected) growth in the rail network in future, i continue to see buses (&amp; coaches too) as continuing to play very vital roles in the transport system as a whole because the omnibus 'plugs the gap' between the car &amp; the train ! Trains (even LRT besides MRT) would NOT be able to offer the superior level of door-step like service convinence which the bus, mini-bus or car can. That i find would remain THE strong point for the continued need for the bus to exist in situations where the car or taxi is not available.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MS:</div><div class="quote_body">I personally drive and ride. Occasionally take bus not only becos its free for me, but becos I need to understand how it feels like to be a passenger in order for me to serve my customers better. I also play in the racetrack on sportsbike in the Johor Circuit. Enjoy technical hands on in the workshop level. I choosed this line because of my desire in automotives. My company also deals with civilian cars. But what I can say is that a bus has a much more complicated and advanced system compared to many cars. Those who used to do cars had problem adapting to the bus workshop where demands are much higher. Although I have mechanics who left the company to do cars. I also have pple who left doing cars to do bus. Even if so, our mechanics are mostly long service personnel. Staff turnover rate is extremely slow. It was only due to the recent aggressive movement by Comfortdelgro that the company has to recruit more professionals to take on the challenge for the future. At the same time hunt for new blood to take over the helm when the older staffs leave. This is also due to good company policies in dealing with staffs. In SBST, I have seen people who worked till the day they die in the work due to old age or illness. They don't want to leave the company until they die. 1 old mechanic was pushing the trolley in Bukit Batok workshop then he suddenly collasped and died. He was over 60. Previous AMK workshop manager was a caucasian called Glenn. He also died due to health problems at old age. These are examples of people who loved the company so much that they'd rather die here than die at home a lonely man.<br><br>Both the cars and buses are different type of vehicles yet they share many similarities too. I was initially shocked to find that there're pple who are crazy about buses. And was pleasantly surprised to see that the hardwork my workshop have put in are not gone unrecognised.<br><br>Public transport need to exist as the country need to maintain the viscousity of the public movement. As some may not want to buy a personal transport or unable to buy. Eg. financial problems, disabled pple etc. And buses form a good part in maintaining the movement of these pple.<br><br>Thanks.</div></blockquote></div>
