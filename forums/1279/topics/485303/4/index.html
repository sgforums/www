              <p>On a different note, Sv 21 is highly neglected by SBST. Only 14 DDs and a huge number of SDs for this service (13 SDs)... When this service actually should have been at least 18 DDs fleet out go the 27 buses.</p>

              <p>Those buses were spotted with the 159 service guide cut out. Perhaps its like the same case as some other DM3500s (like <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">SBS2833B, which had 3 of them)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, but stayed as spare until some other buses were transferred out of 159.</span></p>
              <p>Maybe SBS6125K and SBS6197C are due to be transferred out once their ad contracts expire? Or perhaps some other buses are also due to be transferred out.</p>
              <p>I'm currently confirming the fleet of 159, buses currently spotted are: SBS1967E, SBS1994B, SBS2636D, SBS2761A, SBS2772T, SBS2813J, SBS2833B, SBS6125K, SBS6197C.</p>
              <p>SBS2745Y and SBS2751A (the new additions) are still spotted running around on other services, same case as the to be 159 permers a few months ago.</p>

              Perhaps its like the same case as some other DM3500s
              (like <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">SBS2833B,
              which had 3 of them)</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, but
              stayed as spare until some other buses were transferred out of
              159.</span></p>
              <p>Maybe SBS6125K and SBS6197C are due to be transferred out
              once their ad contracts expire? Or perhaps some other buses are
              also due to be transferred out.</p>
              <p>I'm currently confirming the fleet of 159, buses currently
              spotted are: SBS1967E, SBS1994B, SBS2636D, SBS2761A, SBS2772T,
              SBS2813J, SBS2833B, SBS6125K, SBS6197C.</p>
              <p>SBS2745Y and SBS2751A (the new additions) are still spotted
              running around on other services, same case as the to be 159
              permers a few months ago.</p>

              <p>If you look at the 3 depots you mentioned in your post, what do they have in common that just took place recently? Remember the mass swapping of KUBs for Sv 160 &amp; 170?<br><br>IMO I think they are still trying to sort out the backends and all the leftover deployments &amp; records from the movements of KUBs from their respective depots to BBDEP~ So I'm not too surprised if their efficiency in fleet deployments these few months are slacking off abit. Too busy with too much stuff to do. </p>

              <p>Sv 21 is kinda like Sv 12 in the past few years, having a few SDs in between the DDs' timings. At least the recent fleet adds are DDs, so it's not that bad imo. <br>From what I can see, think they're trying to split the load up during Peak Hours onto several buses instead of mass-loading onto a DD and then waiting super long for the next DD to come.</p>
