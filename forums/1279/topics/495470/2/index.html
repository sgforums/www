              <p>Hi, I am sorry for the rude behavior today and yesterday. Was overwhelmed by the negative energy that was written prior to my posts last night.</p>
                          
                          <p>Would like to inform you that I have nothing against you. In fact, one of the posts I wrote shows that I am receptive towards your recommendations.</p>
                          
                          <p>Unfortunately, online forums (unlike the real-life forums, workshops, talks and seminars) are filled with intellectually-disabled people (reason being is that they donâ€™t need to see the world, and can just hide behind the computer/mobile phone screen and write away), thus the kind of attitude they have towards this article, as they see no reason for change - just by looking at the title, without actually reading the post.</p>
                          
                          <p>In other words, this is the wrong company which you should not interact with.</p>
                          
                          <p>I am sorry for the bad experience.</p>
                          
                          <p>As always, if you have any feedback on our public transport, it is better to feedback to LTA straightaway through their email address:</p>
                          
                          <p>feedback@lta.gov.sg</p>
                          
                          <p>Thank you for expressing interest in our public transportation and offering recommendations to improve the comfort level of our buses.</p>
                          
                          <p>Have a nice day.</p>

                       Perhaps you din read  all  my  replies. Actually the  air  con  , steps and  the  handrest are  feedbacks I  am  giving  on  behalf of the  illiterate old  people. I  am  never  afraid  of  cold.  The  old  folks  told  me  that  many  years  ago  the  old  bus model  did  not  have  any  steps  in  the  sittings area and all the seats faced 1direction unlike now  must  climb  like  a  monkey. They  experienced joint  pain  and  felt  very cold. I  approached  the  driver  and  he  was  unable  to  adjust  it. 
              
              Since  in  the  past  there  were  no steps  then  the  old  model  should  be  revived  with  some changes. Sometimes when  there  are  no  seats  in  front  they  have  no  choice  but  to  move  to  the  back  coz  it's more  dangerous for  them  to  stand..
              
              Whoever  approve  a  design  must  be  smart  enough  to  know what's good  for  the  commuters  and  not be  taken  in  by  some  useless  award  then  let  the  commuters  suffer . A  young  lady  almost  fell  don't  talk  about  older  people.
                              
              <p>Hi. Maybe i would like to clarify some stuff to see if we have
              similar views</p>
              <p>1. Yes fully agreed. When they brought in the OCs and KUBs, i
              was surprised to find the super high seats at the back of the bus.
              But ever since the citaros and MAN came, the problem of the seats
              at the back became a real problem. I recall this issue being
              discussed some time ago somewhere in this forum, where we expressed
              concern when ppl are getting off the seats at the back where they
              have to step off a precarious 30cm step frm the back. Maybe becoz
              what they really wanted is to allow elderly to occupy the front
              seats where they dont need to climb any steps at all when in the
              bus compared to older bus models (most of them deregistered) where
              every has to climb the 2 steps when boarding (i have ever fell on
              the steps when boarding the bus) Hence in a way they tried to solve
              the problem but not totally.</p>
              <p>The thing abt the seats, i guess it cant really be helped, coz
              thats where impt bus mechanisms are located. They could remove the
              seat but to increase the cap, they add them in. I have ever saw 2
              adults sharing that seat when the bus is super croweded. And not to
              mention it was not a once-off incident. And btw the engine of the
              bus is *really* at the back. Never realise why the back of the bus
              is usually hotter?</p>
              <p>2. Similar issue. Cant be helped. The rear-facing seats are
              there to increase comfort. Imagine if all were front facing...
              passengers have to bend their legs a lot when they seat down.
              Imagine a half-squat position? Just that ur bum is on a chair.</p>
              <p>3. The air condition problem has been a problem frm a long time
              ago. It is either u cant close the outlet, or u cant adjust it to
              blow away from u etc. Too bad the design is *this bad*. </p>
              <p>4. Charger thing like what ND323F said. Wayang only. Practical
              for long-dist only.</p>
              <p>5. Yes to what sgbuses mentioned. Only for TT buses. Personally
              i hope they dont standardise it to the full sg bus fleet. Unless u
              refer to the normal smell of the bus? </p>

              <p>Why Singapore's public bus transportation is what it is today is due to the bus lobbyists on social media who are still in their quest to "Make Singapore buses great again" for about a decade.

              <p>Now they want to "Keep Singapore buses great". The new buses coming in the future will be in line with that "vision". I just wonder how much the fare increase is going to be this year. I have discussed about this previously in detail, it won't be a pretty sight.</p>

              <p>This is what happens when views of how and what Singapore's public buses should be is dominated by powerful lobbyists on social media. And then telling its supporters to push LTA for them.</p>
              <p>The air-conditioning (including the ducts) is designed for summer and winter seasons. The bus lobbyists, in caring more about style over substance (read: design language), forgot that Singapore is summer all year round.</p>

              <p>The previous transport minister, the one who introduced BSEP (bus service enhancement programme) and BCM (Bus Contracting Model), might had been asked to leave. As not only did he resign, his constituency was badly affected in the redrawing of electoral boundaries during the 2015 general elections.</p>

Plus all the MRT breakdowns that affected public confidence on public transport and the government. He was probably black-listed and asked to leave.</p>

In other words, they consider the engine efficiency, maintenance costs and other factors to determine the product that has the lowest overall price in the long run (â€œlife cycle costsâ€�).</p>
                                                                                      
                                                                                      <p>Would you rather have a cheap product that requires frequent maintenance, or would you rather have an expensive product that requires little maintenance? Obviously is the product that is expensive and requires little maintenance as the total cost throughout the same amount of lifespan is lower.</p> 
                                  <p>^^ but thatâ€™s just a general guideline. Overall still need to look at the life cycle costs. If the life cycle costs of the expensive product is higher than the life cycle costs of the cheap product, then also no point.</p>
                              
                              <p>What the government really wants is the lowest life cycle costs, not the lowest price. Or whether the product has won any awards or received good reviews elsewhere (eg. Volvo B9TL used in Hong Kong and London, thus Singapore also use). I believe itâ€™s the life cycle costs that determines everything.</p>

                              <p>But if low cost implies contractors will cut corners that can
              trigger major tragedy. I watched a YouTube video one of the
              airlines thought using the home type of systems will save company
              lots of money. End up all the flight passengers died in the air
              disaster because the home system canâ€™t be used in the sky due to
              pressure differences.</p>
