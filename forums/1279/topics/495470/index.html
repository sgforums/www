              The new bus design nowadays do not take into consideration of the following:
              
              1. Functionality: unnecessary steps within the bus. I pity the old people with joint pain who have to climb up and down the steps within the bus ( not referring to double decker). The commuters also risk the chance of falling in a moving bus. 1 child plus 1 adult seat is not practical because if the child is fat ,both will be very uncomfortable. It should be a 2 adult seater because this type still can still accomodate the 1 child and 1 adult commuters. The engines should be behind so there could be more sitting capacity in the bus
              
              2. Comfort: Some seats got hand rest that makes it quite difficult to sit especially when the bus is in motion. I have seen an obese lady struggling to sit. The seats for some buses are very high. This means the step is high too.
              
              3. Air condition: should allow commuters to control individually whether they want it be colder or not. Some commuters are afraid of cold.
              
              4. Charger in the bus: not necessary because the journeys are short.
              
              5. Do not add automated air freshener because the sweet smelling chemicals are harmful to the body. It can also cause some people to develop headaches and nausea.

              The 2 seater for adults instead of 1 adult 1 kid means it won't be depriving another adult of a seat in the event there is no kid on board the bus. The aim is not to accommodate the fat kid. I mention the fat kid because the size of the seat seems to be too small for 1 adult and 1 normal size kid. 
                  
                  Please refer to the old design of the bus where there were no steps inside a single deck bus at all. 
                  
                  Smelly sweat and fart are natural bodily produce they will not kill anyone.  However, the man made air fresheners contain carcinogenic chemicals that ultimately  will disrupt the normal cells and cause the development of cancer cells! In addition, it can also cause hormonal imbalance which can also trigger obesity, autoimmune or chronic diseases. Obviously, you are unaware there are people may develop allergic reactions to the air freshener.  It can also aggravate people who have sinus or asthma  problem!
                  
                  I am never afraid of cold in the air con environment .  I  am speaking on behalf of old people who ever complained to me that the air con was too cold for them.  When I asked the driver if he could adjust the air con,  he said he couldn't .  Have you considered a sick person?  Even a short ride the cold may be unbearable.
                  
                  Wouldnt the installation of the chargers incur unnecessary cost? Public shouldn't ask for something that does not serve much purpose unless they want to the fare price to be $3! Don't forget the chargers also consume the fuel.  Come to think of it the price could be $6 if oil price hit the last historical high.

              The handrest is totally an unnecessary feature.  Without it can reduce cost. 
                      
                      If a design can cause people to be injured like the handrest and the air freshener,  shouldn't it be bought up? Potential problems should be preempted before it blossoms into a fatal tragedy. Prevention is always better than cure! 
                      
                      I have witnessed a lady who almost fell because of the handrest! Should rectify before someone actually falls!

              You are trading the harmless fart and sweat for the sweet smelling toxic chemicals!  No wonder more and more Singaporeans end up getting chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases.  It is ignorant people who embraced the various types of  toxins on a daily basis,  end up destroying the immunity system and other vital organs. Then pay astronomical  money to treat the chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases causing the health care cost to sky rocket! 
                              
                              It is a more ridiculous suggestion to even mention hiring a coach/grab as a mode of normal travelling!  Must be the suggestion of another book smart person. Pay $200/$20 instead of $2 for the same trip!

                              <p>Yes, I agree charger is not necessary. Itâ€™s a fucking waste of money to supply additional battery just for the cheapskate who donâ€™t want to charge at home.</p>
                      <p>air freshener is driver ownself add one. Some drivers have it, and itâ€™s across all 4 operators. LTA should really ban drivers from using air freshener on buses.</p>

              It is better to use the fuel for the bus journey rather than on the chargers that people can only use for the short duration.  Most of the commuters do not travel from the beginning of the journey to the end therefore the chargers only benefit a few people.  The chargers will also deplete the fuel too.  Why incur unnecessary cost to have a feature that hardly benefit the majority who travel too short a journey to charge? 
                  
                  It is similar to installing a television set in the bus.  Simply not practical because the commuters can't watch a complete programme. 
                  
                  The transport company can say now the cost will not be passed to commuters but when there is a spike in oil price due to increased operating cost they will have no choice.  Guess who have to pay? 
                  
                  For everything, we have to assess if it is a necessity, need or want.  Every aspects have to be considered carefully before taking the plunge. Some people are very myopic.  The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his capable team were able to amass a lot of reserves for Singapore because they did not splurge at all.

              Larger steps for the boarding and alighting area (that part I agree is poorly designed),   but internally in the seating area there wasn't any step. 
                  
                  All of you target me 1st. Hurling vulgarity, derogatory remarks like stupid or sarcastic remarks are typical cyber bullies the moderator should do something about. 
                  
                  When you are in the forum you represent your family,  when you are abroad you are representing Singapore.  Don't bring shame to your family and your country with your speech, mannerism and action. It is the ugly Singaporeans who give Singapore a bad name. 
                  
                  Please read about how air freshener can kill you then tell me if I am right about bringing up this subject. Air freshener can cause strange forms of cancer, genetic disorders, affects eyes, nose, cause kidney and liver failures! Can you imagine every day the commuters keep Inhaling such toxins? Singapore will become an ailing population!

              <p>The new bus design nowadays do not take into consideration of
              the following:</p>
              <p>1. Functionality: unnecessary steps within the bus. I pity the
              old people with joint pain who have to climb up and down the steps
              within the bus ( not referring to double decker). The commuters
              also risk the chance of falling in a moving bus. 1 child plus 1
              adult seat is not practical because if the child is fat ,both will
              be very uncomfortable. It should be a 2 adult seater because this
              type still can still accomodate the 1 child and 1 adult commuters.
              The engines should be behind so there could be more sitting
              capacity in the bus</p>
              <p>2. Comfort: Some seats got hand rest that makes it quite
              difficult to sit especially when the bus is in motion. I have seen
              an obese lady struggling to sit. The seats for some buses are very
              high. This means the step is high too.</p>
              <p>3. Air condition: should allow commuters to control individually
              whether they want it be colder or not. Some commuters are afraid of
              cold.</p>
              <p>4. Charger in the bus: not necessary because the journeys are
              short.</p>
              <p>5. Do not add automated air freshener because the sweet smelling
              chemicals are harmful to the body. It can also cause some people to
              develop headaches and nausea.</p>

              <p>Hi. Maybe i would like to clarify some stuff to see if we have similar views</p>
              <p>1. Yes fully agreed. When they brought in the OCs and KUBs, i was surprised to find the super high seats at the back of the bus. But ever since the citaros and MAN came, the problem of the seats at the back became a real problem. I recall this issue being discussed some time ago somewhere in this forum, where we expressed concern when ppl are getting off the seats at the back where they have to step off a precarious 30cm step frm the back. Maybe becoz what they really wanted is to allow elderly to occupy the front seats where they dont need to climb any steps at all when in the bus compared to older bus models (most of them deregistered) where every has to climb the 2 steps when boarding (i have ever fell on the steps when boarding the bus) Hence in a way they tried to solve the problem but not totally.</p>
              <p>The thing abt the seats, i guess it cant really be helped, coz thats where impt bus mechanisms are located. They could remove the seat but to increase the cap, they add them in. I have ever saw 2 adults sharing that seat when the bus is super croweded. And not to mention it was not a once-off incident. And btw the engine of the bus is *really* at the back. Never realise why the back of the bus is usually hotter?</p>
              <p>2. Similar issue. Cant be helped. The rear-facing seats are there to increase comfort. Imagine if all were front facing... passengers have to bend their legs a lot when they seat down. Imagine a half-squat position? Just that ur bum is on a chair.</p>
              <p>3. The air condition problem has been a problem frm a long time ago. It is either u cant close the outlet, or u cant adjust it to blow away from u etc. Too bad the design is *this bad*. </p>
              <p>4. Charger thing like what ND323F said. Wayang only. Practical for long-dist only.</p>
              <p>5. Yes to what sgbuses mentioned. Only for TT buses. Personally i hope they dont standardise it to the full sg bus fleet. Unless u refer to the normal smell of the bus? </p>
