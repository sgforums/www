SAF is turning 3rd generations and during my recent reservist I can see that they're really shedding the unwanted parts and absorbing the parts that are going to propel the entire organisation to become even more competitive in the defence industry. So is SBS Transit. The new management styles are starting to build in. More aggressive policies, more professional operational &amp; technical ideas. With an even more effective cost control.<br><br>Even so, safety has never been an agenda for cost savings. Because lives can never be replaced with any amount of money. Therefore the company takes extreme serious views on product safety which one of them is our buses. This fire case after some evaluations, there have been some discoveries. But facts showed that highly unlikely involved with workshop maintenance failure. It is more like a suay thing that happens once in a super blue moon. Frankly speaking, in my whole life in this industry, this is the first time I heard of such diagnosis &amp; I was totally taken aback when I first heard the diagnosis.<br><br>A suitable analogy is like: you get banged down by a Ferrari. What I can only say is plainly suay.<br><br>For SL track records in safety, I believe many of you are aware of the high standards imposed and executed. So the rest of the buses are still safe to travel in. No matter what we want to have zero injuries to all my passengers.<br><br>I'd like to repeat, [b]because you pay good bus fare, I will do whatever I can to give you good bus. This is sensible business.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>Well, I can understand what you are trying to say. No one wants this kind of things to happen either. I always have faith in the maintenance standards of SBS Transit (unlike some other company  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  ), and even if there are lapses in maintenance, they are always rectified quickly, especially when the demanding commuter's complaints roll in. Commuter comfort is one thing, but their safety is even more important - and such maintenance can actually never be measured in value. They may cost this much, but their inherent value could be human lives - something immeasurable by any kind of money.<br><br>And if you say that it was not likely due to lack of maintenance, then either one of two things stands: freak human-caused accident other than lack of maintenance (cigarette butts, etc. come to mind), or just science and Mother Nature deciding to demonstrate some physics in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>I wonder what will happen next with this bus, but likely it will have to depart for the land where motor vehicles are eternally blessed ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).</div>
