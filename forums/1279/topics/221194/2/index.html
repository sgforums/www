Yes, no denying that. What's more, that fella who flame some of the sgf here <span style="font-style: italic;">specifically</span> labelled who he's directing the attack to. I won't forget that episode so easily even if you call me childish because that was such a blatant show of disregard. But if you're to say that most of the folks you mentioned are like that, I disagree. It's just a couple of black sheeps. Talk about forgetting and forgiving, right, zilchster?</div>
