Dennis Lances are deployed on high capaicty routes as I think Tibs find them able to go faster.<br><br>As you may have noticed, Mercedes Benz O405 has become regular on sv 852.<br><br>Most of the Yishun services have been transferred to AMKDEP, except for some services like 856 and 859 which are from WLDEP.<br><br>The unusual deployments on service 806 may mean two things,<br><br>1. Tibs are getting ready to deploy service 804 with Bendy Buses.<br><br>2. From my point of view, as service 106 will be amended to ply between Bt Batok and Marina Ctr, the entire fleet will be moved from partial AMKDEP to full KJDEP. As such, AMKDEP may have extra buses which can be deployed on other services. Tibs services are also having fleet changes these days.<br><br>Have a nice day,</div>

Will those bendys freed from 106 benefit 851 in anyway? 985 will take buses from AMKDEP and KJDEP. Will 985 kindly help absorb some of the lances?

Any specific timings? So that I can catch one to go home. If they gonna put bendies on 857 as usual deployment, they will have to shift the boarding berth at Yishun Interchange to those "drive through" type from the "drive in and reverse out" type. And they havent got any "drive through" type left at Yishun.<br><br>I do sometimes take bendy 857's on weekends though.<br><br></div>

The lateral suspension on the Lance is so bad (or no lateral suspension at all), you'd think you are boarding a 1980's bus. I havent seen any other modern singapore bus that have their standee handles swing so violently left to right from the ceiling pole.<br><br>Unfortunately the O405's deployment in 852 are more or less on a daily adhoc decision basis although TIB492X, TIB559M and TIB544E are becoming semi-regulars. I wont mind sending all of 851's O405 CAC's to 852 and having 851 fully "benditised"! Haha<br><br>I dont think 106 will take buses from AMKDEP anymore from this sunday onwards. Geographically KJDEP seems to be the more logical and closer depot than AMKDEP from Bukit Batok. And as for the Marina Centre side, both AMKDEP and KJDEP seems to have the same distance-merit so it might make more sense for 106 to be fully KJDEP. Though I wont mind if it is the other case and 106 soaks up all the Lances  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And oh yeah, did anyone notice that you may not have seen TIB 931 X ever before? Actually that bus was destroyed in an engine fire while on 169 in Woodlands area, sometime in the last quarter of 1999. Totally insalvageable, the entire roof and window panes were gone including the windscreen. I saw it while i was cycling somewhere in Woodlands. Some of you may remember it. And yeah, as expected, it was a Lance 245. Barely one year old.</div>

And it is actually a very hazardous and dangerous thing to be a Standing Passenger in one of those viking-ride buses. Plus I carry a heavy laptop too. Curse whoever puts them into 851 during peak hours. It makes totally no sense at all as only a bendy would be appropriate. And you can imagine the frustration and de-moralisation when you see bendy after bendy (ALMOST EMPTY ONES SOMEMORE) going past the same bus stops on other services like 61, 960 or 190 while I wait for 851. Curse whoever planned the fleet for 851.<br><br>Actually at times when i board Lance 245's on lower load routes like service 852 during the school holidays or 855 close to midnight, the experience isnt too bad.<br><br>But the Lance 245's and 211's all are horribly maintained. The carpet-like surface covering the aircon ducts at the top (for Lance 245's) are not cleaned at all since the buses were bought and those dust mites can give me asthma. And if the bus goes on high speed you can almost feel it falling apart - I once sat at the first front facing seat on the right with my foot placed on the front wheel hump - I could feel the hump moving and pulsating against the floorboard!<br></div>

And it is actually a very hazardous and dangerous thing to be a Standing Passenger in one of those viking-ride buses. Plus I carry a heavy laptop too. Curse whoever puts them into 851 during peak hours. It makes totally no sense at all as only a bendy would be appropriate. And you can imagine the frustration and de-moralisation when you see bendy after bendy (ALMOST EMPTY ONES SOMEMORE) going past the same bus stops on other services like 61, 960 or 190 while I wait for 851. Curse whoever planned the fleet for 851.<br><br>Actually at times when i board Lance 245's on lower load routes like service 852 during the school holidays or 855 close to midnight, the experience isnt too bad.<br><br>But the Lance 245's and 211's all are horribly maintained. The carpet-like surface covering the aircon ducts at the top (for Lance 245's) are not cleaned at all since the buses were bought and those dust mites can give me asthma. And if the bus goes on high speed you can almost feel it falling apart - I once sat at the first front facing seat on the right with my foot placed on the front wheel hump - I could feel the hump moving and pulsating against the floorboard!<br></div></blockquote>The carpet surface was part of the DM design. Just too unlucky to be used in Dennis Lance.<br><br>This same carpet surface is/was used in the SBS MB0405s.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup I tend to agree with you. The main reason for 'hating' a bus is not a one-off issue, esp being bus enthusiasts, we tend to take the whole fleet into consideration before declaring that we hate the bus. This also leads to the fact that one have to be experienced and sat enough of the bus for a sufficiently long period of time to know that lousy is the norm for that model, not the unusual. For example, most of the Lance 211 hate group are always stuck with Lance 211s and had taken the bus over many times, long or short journeys at different times of the day, and would probably had sat on all the 211s before reaching a conclusion that it really sux.<br><br>On the other hand, people who have a variety of buses to take daily are spoilt for choice. They take a little of each every day and hence, have the effect spread out over a prolonged period of time, and hebce, do not feel the discomfort as those who are forced to take it daily. Moreover, the probability of getting a sucky bus is also much less, and is inversely proportional to the number of choices and the mean frequency and overall fleet deployment.<br><br>Hope I had cleared the air around here.</div>
