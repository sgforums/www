                  didn't stop the public bus and attend to the fracas first before 
                  continuing given to the fact that the fracas was causing him significant
                   distraction? Given to the fact that the public bus is a very large and 
                  heavy vehicle that can endanger many lives- both inside and outside- 
                  shouldn't safety have been the driver's first priority? Or were share

                  underestimated, so 'temasektimes' is wrong to call it a 'freak 
                  accident'- the said bus driver should have asked either for the 
                  squabbling passengers to either tone down/ leave, or in all likelihood 
                  that that wouldn't happen, lock the doors and call his HQ about the 
                  incident and perhaps the police to resolve this potentially hazardous 
                  public bus transport incident in a timely and expeditious manner before 
                  carrying on- a driver distracted by such intense passenger fracas 
                  on-board cannot be expected to drive in a cautious and attentive manner.<br> <br> Ditching safety for profitability will cost Singapore lives dearly.<br> <br>

                  intimately with a PRC woman at a bus stop and confronted them directly.<br> The adulterous couple were shocked and tried to run away by boarding up 
                  an incoming bus. The aunty followed suit and asked the PRC woman why she
                   seduced her husband to which she replied in a sarcastic tone:<br> “It is not my fault. You only have yourself to blame for marrying the wrong guy!”<br> On hearing the words, the aunty went berserk and tried to strangle the 
                  PRC woman. The ensuing fracas caused the bus driver to be distracted and
                   he knocked into a motorcyclist minutes later.<br> It is not known if anybody was injured or killed during the accident.</td>

              <p>Not too sure, only read the temasek times report that only revealed it to be a 'public bus' that the couple used as 'get away' vehicle that unfortunately had to stop for them when flagged at a bus stop- then again, only 2 public bus companies exists in Singapore right?</p>
