            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.. let me bring back this topic again. I wonder if you guys know that part of Sv 143's fleet is based at SLBP. Sv 143 is a joint operation of BRAM + AMKDEP and SLBP, that is why you could see most of the fleet is LO 3 Axle (from SLBP). I suppose that about 30-45% of the fleet is from AMKDEP, e.g. 9000S, and some MB O.405. Sv 143 can get VO 3 Axle from AMKDEP. However, look at the percentage of VO 3 Axle in AMKDEP. Rather of a small percentage. If Sv 143 is managed by BBDEP, instead of SLBP, I can tell you that VO 3 Axle can be plied on this sv.</div>

A cameo could be possible, but from AMDEP, as SLBP has double-deck Volvos of the 2-axle variety. O405s I think are from both depots, while 9000S is definitely with AMDEP.</div>

SBST seems to be biased against the West, perhaps due to the industrial estate where they feel they can dump the old buses there for use in JIS. Sv. 174 cannot get double-decks due to the trees at Old Jurong Rd, however it will get CNG B10BLEs soon. VSO thing is not entirely true. Look at Sv. 88, it goes to the East, where are the VSOs? Same for Sv. 8, it has no perm VSOs and always borrows from other services.<br><br>In that case I think Sv. 133, Sv. 56 and Sv. 70 VSOs exist for the sole purpose of "showing-off" to tourists and office workers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah... I think it's because AMKDEP 'grabs' the buses first. Then, AMKDEP would ply these buses onto routes that are popular within the bus svcs that they control. Well, you can still see VSO going to the west, i.e. Sv 157. Although it is not permanent, it still has the 'qualificatin' for being the bus that goes to the West. SLBP gets older buses, because of the Jurong Industrial buses i guess. Also, the shuffling of buses have made it in the way that old buses have to be landed somewhere that could accommodate them.</div>
