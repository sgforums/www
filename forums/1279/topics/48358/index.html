            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys. Just stop all these 'quarreling' around. Why would you guys would like to quarrel over a bus? It isn't worth to do so. If u like or dun like the bus, just go ahead and like it or hate it to the core, just by yourself.<br><br>I personally feel that such 'quarrels' are just unnecessary and I hate to see it. I hope that you guys just stop it, please?<br><br>Also, I would like to express another view of Leyland Olympian 3 Axle. You see. Without the Leyland Olympian 3 Axle, would you have Volvo Olympian 3 Axle, and Volvo Super Olympian today? The answer is no. All of us should thank the creation of the Leyland Olympian 3 Axle. Without it, Volvo might not be able to come up with them today.</div>

Can't you take a joke? Judging from this post, obviously not. I don't want to do anything about you hating 3-axle LOs or N113CRBs, I can't even be bothered to change your mindset. By your asking me to leave, if I were to follow your "advice" and quit I would be visualised as a loser, so ALL THE MORE I will stay.</div>
