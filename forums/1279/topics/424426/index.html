              180 still loop at BNL?
                  960 Should convert 2 spilt into full day..Terrible 13AM/PM 8 Split-Shift for cash cow service that plies busy route
                  700A no comment,Eversince Kranji take over becoming from bad to worse..At least during Woodlands time there's bendy even for off peak
              963 has slightly improved because of complains..From 20 to 21 then 24 buses excluding the Express and Resorts service..

              <p>700A's poor frequency is not due to low ridership. Its because the runtime is too tight. Although they plan frequencies like 12-15 minutes (off peak), the actual frequency is between 17 - 20 minutes (off peak) whenever there is a jam. Any jams along the way would result in the service being unable to start on time from interchange, resulting in delay.<br><br>I always see delay notice being placed whenever there is a traffic jam along Orchard or BKE/PIE.</p>

              <p>Svc 180 - Schedule. During AM Peak, many commuters boarding 180 from Bukit Panjang Int. Bukit Panjang bound passengers not many during AM Peak, so bus goes off service back to BPI to catch more commuters up.</p>

              You got a point. i think just open up and let competitors enter their territories should be good enough already. and hopefully we can see SBST operating some routes with ADDS that compete their cash cow routes. Of course, SMRT is also free to enter SBST territories to compete, but then what can they offer? This is called healthy competition isn't it? Now they are just operating as 2 different monopoly; is this healthy?

              <p><br>Yes, more innovative due to the absence of limitations of serving one place to another. I see more interesting happenings on the bus scene going on since the 1970s, from the 1980s till late 1990s.</p>

              <p><br>This dumb territory rule just screws everything up with all those limitations. Healthy competition don't exist here as long as all these senseless rules are in place. Commuters suffer from poor transport links just because resources of one company cannot be fully utilise to serve places that are poorly linked.</p>
