              <p>Can post at two forum at first</p>
              <p>My comments</p>
              <p>1. Maybe a new route: Bukit Merah Int- Tiong Baharu- Bukit HoSwee and returned at same route.</p>
              <p>2. Can take 63 to other MRT station mah, or try a new route: Redhill MRT- Hoy Fatt (SBS- Dennis Dart 2XA/P 1X Peak Hour)</p>
              <p>3. Can walk if you have staminia, quite short a distance mah</p>
              <p>4. Agree, but beware, after CCL was opened, 61 may be rerouted</p>

              <p>I see that someone lives in Bukit Merah/Queensway area.</p>
              <p>For the first one, just walk lah, isn't too far in.</p>
              <p>One classic example is the Jln eunos bus stop, no proper direction signs and shelter, you have to walk through the market to the MRT or for 154.</p>

              <p>I think what SBST and SMRT have to learn from Hong Kong bus system is that the bus route must be dedicated to certain area. e.g. 61 is just for bukit batok, pasir panjang/telok blangah, then eunos, so u can detour around bb, then take PIE/AYE to telok blangah, not to cater the need for all bukit batok, toh yi, holland village, tanglin halt, alex village, etc...; so for tanglin halt, u can make service 195 go to tanglin halt first, then go commonwealth estate, that's fair. But doing this means passengers must know how to transfer, and the bus fare should be charged by the number of zones, not the number of stages, heard government was going to implement this, but no news after that.</p>

              <p><br>That's your own opinion. Buses have been maximising seats, however, they want to extend bus rides not for just us, and also handicaps. If there are many seats, no place for handicap, wouldn't it be of jus a normal bus without the aim of letting handicap persons to board it?</p>

              <p>But when there's no "abuses" of "their rights", I'm highly impressed by the frequency of the buses in London and Manchester, as well as London Tube. Imagine at Manchester, there's this road dubbed "the busiest" in UK. There's practically buses flying past every 5 minutes almost throughout the day!</p>
              <p>But then again, like what some said, as places are planned differently, we can't expect the same everywhere. But of course, as much as our public transport seem impressive, there is definitely room for improvement.</p>
              <p>I guess the weather also plays a part. It's more comfortable to walk when the humidity is low. That is why many locals hate to walk under the hot sun. Humidity is an issue here. Practices, tolerance and perceptions can sometimes make alot of difference. Perhaps culture shock would be a good solution here. Lol!!</p>

              <p>I do understand that the difference between town structures in HK and in Singapore, I lived there for one year, HK towns are more of a point structure, so from one town to the other, u dont expect people to board/alight along the road, but this is obviously the opposite side of the case in singapore. On the other hand, their bus fare system encourages people to always take the bus whose destination is in your own town to avoid paying unnecessary fares. This fare system might not be practical to singapore bus system, but it is better to have an idea about local or express service to save passenger's time. U see, new york subway system uses a lot of express services to cut down the travel time, why not in Singapore?</p>
