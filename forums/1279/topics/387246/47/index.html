              <p>Quite true, especially without the existence of the trade plate. It looks too new to be an existing bus, seriously. Even refurbished buses don't have brand new looking exteriors. The only way the see if it's a brand new bus is to see if the PIS is fitted.</p>

              <p>i feel that sv 52 should be made AM/SL controlled instead of solo SL. my reason for this is because of first few buses issues. if i'm not wrong, bus departing from 0545 - 0655 at bishan int are all off svc from slbp and start their first trip at bishan.</p>
              <p>this few days i observed that the trip departing at 0641 &amp; 0655 from T1 failed to meet the schedule timings along the way. i have no idea what is the traffic like along sin ming ave &amp; bishan st 22 at 7am as i board the bus along upp thomson, therefore i couldn't jump into any conclusion.</p>
              <p>today i went to try taking sv 52 from bishan int. i reached bishan int around 0643. saw the 0641 depart on time, therefore i tried waiting for the 0655 trip. at 0700, the bus was nowhere seen. in the end the 0709 bus was instructed to depart at 0701 instead.</p>
              <p>my conclusion at that point of time was that maybe the off svc bus was stuck in a jam along PIE or something. if that is the case, how great would it be if the first few buses were from AMDEP, like last time. quite disappointing.</p>
