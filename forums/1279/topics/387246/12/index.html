              <p>Sit more buses before you comment. If you'd ask most of the people here even Bus Captains themselves, they will tell you that SLBP buses are poorly maintained. i remember a bus captain telling me SBS9030E was a good bus when it was first transferred. along with SBS343L, SBS9149Y, SBS9168S and SBS9547G.</p>
              <p>about amdep fire, i believe it was an electronics fault which caused the AMDEP fire, it isnt possible to check every bus every night you have to understand that.</p>

              <p>Sit more buses before you comment. If you'd ask most of the people here even Bus Captains themselves, they will tell you that SLBP buses are poorly maintained. i remember a bus captain telling me SBS9030E was a good bus when it was first transferred. along with SBS343L, SBS9149Y, SBS9168S and SBS9547G.</p>
              <p>about amdep fire, i believe it was an electronics fault which caused the AMDEP fire, it isnt possible to check every bus every night you have to understand that.</p>

The A/C is even better than SBS 9625P which is so stuffy at the lower deck. SLBP cleaned up the interior mess of SBS 9030E and refurbish the bus.

              <p>tell this to the number of people who don't like SLBP because of their badly maintained buses. it doesn't sound right if there's more than 2 or 3 people commenting about how badly most of their buses perform.</p>
              <p>if you have taken more SBST buses, you'll come to realise that there are more buses in SLBP which lacks in maintenance than other depots. im not siding any depots but so far SLBP has given me the least comfort out of any other depots.</p>

SLBP buses no hub reduction sound also. unlike buses like 280J 314X 326L 444D 465T 472Y 492P 501Y 533E etc. with such beautiful engine and hub sounds. 9547G also not from SLBP. 9625P lower deck stuffy? i haven't heard of batch 3's with stuffy ac.
