              <p>very contradictory statement you have make there. if SL VO3xs are the best, then how about the VO3xs of other depots? and SBS9392K isn't that good.</p>

              <p><br>U guys always complain and complain. After that, what I heard the problems are minor. Do even think that the drivers are just entertaining u? If there any fault, they should report to the mech. Comparing the merc between AM and SL, I had say many times that they AM merc are generally better than SL ones. Why? they spent so much money to refurbish. But in the end, we see these buses scrapping in a few months time.</p>
              <p>Please do not say things that I nv practised. I believe you are the one who hide AM/BR problems. Remember SBS 9888Y? Before it being burnt down I had heard many ppl complaining about the suspension. U even pointed out? No depots are perfect, I had said these hundreds of times. Sometimes I even feedback on SLBP buses . But by submitting the whole SL fleet u think is funny? Who is doing stunt?</p>

              <p><br>Sometimes if we are not working there, is not good to talk so much abt it.</p>
              <p>putting in new parts doesn't mean anything. U can put a new ram in ur com but u sure it is compatible? Putting new parts without testing them thoroughly means nothing. If a bus requires frequent maintenance, SBS will not buy it. Cos new bus just need to change engine oil, do some flushing and clean up the a/c or vents.</p>

              <p>sir, please read again. i'm actually referring to what you said about SLBP VO3xes. you said they are the best, i don't think so. most of them are ok-ok. now that i've said this i think you know why i compare what i said just now to the VO3xs in other depots. in fact only a few like SBS9375K and SBS9496U are good. SBS9392K has a bad suspension, vibration is a bit violent, pickup isn't that good, aircon is so-so.</p>
