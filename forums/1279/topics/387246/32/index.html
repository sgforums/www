              <p><br>Naw I rather feedback to the SBST people. Hope they realise that they haven't been doing proper advertising and publicity when they want to change route details or make some amendments.</p>
              <p>The MBS amendment notice came out barely 3 days before it actually took place, how would passengers react to the change in time?</p>
              <p>When the Sv85 amendment poster came out I wasn't surprised that they omitted details (don't know deliberately or carelessly) to inform people about the variations in routes towards Yishun.</p>

              <p><br>blame LTA. They only released the opening of Bayfront Ave 3 days bef the opening.</p>
              <p>Tat 106 was pre-empt. Sekali last minute Bayfront Ave could not be opened on tat Sunday how?</p>
              <p>Release of route amendement time release is there for a reason.</p>

              <p>Noticed that Sv39 has alot of peak hr demand but the schedule doesn't seem to be able to cater to that demand.</p>
              <p>Saw that the queue for Sv39 stretched to the end of Sv855 berth again this morning, apparently another bus was unable to depart on time again for some reason.</p>
              <p>The morning headway is 19 19 15 16 15 16. Seriously feel that it's very ridiculous for such headways during morning peak. Hopefully they do something to improve Sv39 service standards so that at least it can prove to be a competitor towards SMRT svcs heading east.</p>
              <p>On a side note they don't seem to be bothered about the different types of Sv85 routes running. Both the Sv85s that are using the old route and the new route also show Sv85, how will a pax (esp around the transition time) know that the Sv85 will go by the new route or the old route?</p>
              <p>Sent an SMS to iris on Tues morning 6+ towards Yishun to test out. It came back as Not operating now &amp; Not operating now. So effectively the Sv85s using old route are not logged in?</p>

              <p>The 10 mins freq is running for 1 hr. With the number of buses running, it's obvious in between the freq is going to be bad. It isn't just affecting Sv 39, take a look at Sv 5, 32 esp during PM peak.</p>
              <p>No doubt though Sv 39 would need 1 more S shift during the peak hours for traffic towards PSR during AM peak.</p>

              <p><br>Don't you find it awkward that Sv85 headway from Yishun is 13 13 13 15 15 15 and the buses depart hardly half seated, yet Sv39 with a poorer headway is always fully seated and half-filled with standees.</p>

              <p><br>It's not awkward because 85 is a non QoS service, hence it's scheduling is not affected by tat 1 hr stretch of 10 mins freq politics. It's not tied by anything.</p>
              <p>Take a look at other QoS svs tat has small fleet you notice the post 10 mins freq gap and the corresponding opp direction tat is not obliged for e 10 mins rule (lower demand side).</p>
