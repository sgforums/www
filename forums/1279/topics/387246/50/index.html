              <p><strong>SBS7240D (SLBP 192)<br></strong>I was joyriding on Service 192 in the direction of Tuas Terminal. The Bus Captain suddenly stopped at the last bus stop of Tuas Link 4 and started cleaning and checking the bus. When he came to the upper deck of the bus, he saw me and asked me why I was taking Service 192. I replied him that I was joyriding on this service and was immediately being chased off at Tuas West Dr (Raffles Marina).</p>
              <p><strong>SBS8192C (SLBP 174/174e*)<br></strong>While alighting from the bus, a woman fell off the bus and hurt her legs. Her daughter alighted and calmed her down. She tried to pull her up but to no avail. The Bus Captain closed the EDS and doors of the bus and came to have a look at the woman. He contacted a SBS Transit staff in green uniform for assistance. The personnel asked the woman's daughter to contact other family members for help. Next, her son arrived and tried to pull her up again, but it was of no use. Finally, her son decided to call the ambulance to bring the woman to the hospital. While the woman's son was calling the ambulance, SBS9038J arrived and parked in the second Service 174 parking lot. SBS8192C's Bus Captain told SBS9038J's Bus Captain about the incident and asked her to take over his duties as he had to attend to the injured woman. Then, SBS9038J's Bus Captain went over to SBS9087S, parking at the second Fast Forward 174e parking lot and started the bus engine. Finally, Service 174 had arrived. In a moment, the ambulance arrived and carried the woman away, together with her daughter and son, as well as the Bus Captain and staff.</p>
