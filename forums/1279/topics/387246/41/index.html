              <p>cant find the SBS Transit OC500LE thread anymore so I posted here.</p>
              <p>last I heard Chitson did not take the bus since it was painted gray and spotted at Cycle &amp; Carriage.</p>
              <p>yesterday I was on my way back along Boon Lay Way on 180 when I saw a white bus with an interior suspiciously alike to the KUBs.</p>
              <p>then I noticed it is a Chitson bus (company name and details printed on its side) and low-entry, a lot like the OC500LE. even the EDS is similar.</p>
              <p>the seats were replaced with more comfortable ones and the standee area is replaced with more seats.</p>
              <p>it is registered as PA9588S. can someone confirm if this bus is the OC in question via LTA e-services? [don't know how to]</p>

              <p>wtf. i'm serious! am i that stupid that i can't tell the difference between SBS/SMRT and ringtone/speaker? i had a shock too when i boarded the bus. it was LOUD and CLEAR.</p>
              <p>but one thing to note, the system is not "fixed" onto the bus. the speaker and some device (obviously a device to play the announcement) was place at the empty spot beside the entrance door (the place where the fare ticket machine was last time). the speaker (which look exactly same as the doorbell speaker) was place above the side desto holder.</p>
