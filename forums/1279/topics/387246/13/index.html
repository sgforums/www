SLBP buses no hub reduction sound also. unlike buses like 280J 314X 326L 444D 465T 472Y 492P 501Y 533E etc. with such beautiful engine and hub sounds. 9547G also not from SLBP. 9625P lower deck stuffy? i haven't heard of batch 3's with stuffy ac.

              <p>I agree some of the merc in SLBP are not working that well. but they are scrapping and what u expect? Had u take SBS 516E (AM SP) before? I had nv imagine a merc can produce such a high volume of black smoke..</p>

              <p>btw 516E has like some nice hub sounds and smooth acceleration unlike a 539P that vibrates of 548M that sounds horrid.</p>

              <p> I really like bpth 7401G and 7402D on svc 174. I can say the VO3x under SL are the best except SBS 9379A and SBS 9270D.. CNG are nt easy to maintain.. VO2x no A/C but still got engine.. Dun need to maintain?</p>
