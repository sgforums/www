              <p>Look at SBS2601D's post, potential customers may like to take photos of products for their own use, and it is downright unprofessional if they post photos of products on public domain, which in this case, such unacceptable actions occurred. I would say, given that it was removed from public domain, Gemilang or their customer probably had not expected it to be leaked. Taking photos of products and sites are norms in the corporate world, but posting them on public domain without prior approval is not.</p>

              <p>Look at SBS2601D's post, potential customers may like to take
              photos of products for their own use, and it is downright
              unprofessional if they post photos of products on public domain,
              which in this case, such unacceptable actions occurred. I would
              say, given that it was removed from public domain, Gemilang or
              their customer probably had not expected it to be
              leaked. Taking photos of products and sites are norms in
              the corporate world, but posting them on public domain without
              prior approval is not.</p>

                  have said in another thread, the behaviour of bus fans these days
                  are quite honestly, deplorable. Whilst the post was by Adams
                  Coachlines , many of the Singaporean bus fans who commented on that
                  post are acting in a way detrimental to business relationships in
                  the bus industry, much less to say whatever that is left of the
                  relationship between operators and bus fans."</span></p>
              <p>You mentioned about the comments made by S'pore bus fans, tell
                  me how are they acting in a way to cause harm? The comments I've
                  seen are all about the making etc.(MAN) and who it could belongs
                  to(SMRT)...</p>
              <p>You also said there's no reason to speculate right now, BUT the
                  bodywork gave an obvious prediction(Note : Not the finalise
                  answers) that it's from MAN. How could it cause harm then? Are you
                  telling me that Mercedes also have this type of bodywork?

              <p>Since you do not believe what type of effect a simple leak can do, let me quote you a real life example which happened probably about 20yrs back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back then there were 2 Co. (A and B) in a business. Business was alright but then the both companies were always up against one and another and whenever a new product was introduced, they make sure it was the biggest news on the newspaper on the day of the launch. <br><br>Co. A has always been trying to work with ways to improve their own image and how they would better serve their own customers and thus they work very hard with their supplier Z to come out with this new product which would be able to help the company turn around. As they were working on this secret project inside their own factory, all measures were made to make sure that the public would not know anything regarding this project. But little did they know that 1 of their staff leaked out to the public that they were indeed working with supplier Z to bring this product into the market.</p>
              <p>As you might have guessed, this piece of information reached the top mgmt of Co. B. As they were still kinda new to the market, they then had a urgent meeting with their own supplier X to come out with a similar product.</p>
              <p>As the launch for Co. A was near, Co. B then work together with their own supplier X to expedite the launch of their own product into the market. Ended up they were able to lauch it first into the market and as it was a new product that was never been offered to the market before, they got all the attention that they wanted and eventually Supplier X was able to scored a Multi-Million deal with Co. B. <br><br>As for A, they did not manage to get their products first into the market and by the time they were able to launch their new product, they didnt get the attention that they had expected as the public was seen associating the new product with Co. B instead of A. Also, it look bad on Co. A as they were seen as a copycat instead. The product launch was considered a failure and their partnership with Supplier Z for that product ended there thus causing Z to lose a Muti-Million deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do u still think that the product leakage is not as important as it seen ?</p>
