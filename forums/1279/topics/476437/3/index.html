              <p>The new interchanges will accommodate lesser bendy buses compared to now. I do not mind A24s but only if SMRT can maintain DDs, bendies and 12m buses well at once. Right now they do not seem to be able to be coping well with just bendy buses and 12m buses.</p>

              Doesn't give you a reason to speculate the operator/specs/country, moreover, the photo has been removed, suggesting that it was erroneously posted, the act of removal also serves as a signal to the audience to exercise care when handling with the information which has been removed.<br>
              <br>
              Also, Adams Coachlines is not an official source of information, there may be photos, but given the sensitivity of the information involved, the best course of action for bus fans is not to comment on the issue. Refer to SBS2601D's post for further explanation.<br>

                  Look at the past press releases by SBS and SMRT, every purchase they have made for buses is worth millions of dollars, and each purchase is a business deal for the industry players involved.  Misinformation/rumours/leaked information about who the buyer/supplier is, and disparaging remarks about the manufacturer/customer like those on facebook, can affect the outcome of business deals.

              <p><br> Ageeed, as I have said in another thread, the behaviour of bus fans
              these days are quite honestly, deplorable. Whilst the post was by
              Adams Coachlines , many of the Singaporean bus fans who commented
              on that post are acting in a way detrimental to business
              relationships in the bus industry, much less to say whatever that
              is left of the relationship between operators and bus fans.<br> <br> There is no need for bus fans to obtain information through
              unscrupulous method, much less speculate on unconfirmed issues or
              to make disparaging remarks against a bus manufacturer that are
              downright rude. Mind you, whether a product is good for a customer
              is none of your business, the customer would had done their due
              dilligence before making any decisions. Such comments can affect
              the image of a company and may be considered as libel.<br> <br> Just think of this, if you are the one who spread rumours or
              untruths about a product, causing a deal worth millions of dollars
              to fall through, do you feel guilty about it, and are you willing
              to pay for legal damages if they so wish to commence one against
              you? I urge all bus fans to exercise restraint regarding classified
              information, and to stop spreading whatever you think may be
              classified information. Also, bus fans should learn to step into
              the shoes of industry players before commenting, how would you
              think if the comments you make is used against you? I would
              therefore recommend the mods to close this thread, since Adams
              Coachlines has already removed the offending photos.</p>
