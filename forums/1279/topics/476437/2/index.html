              <p>m-b don't seem to have dd in citybus use for their original bodied omnibus range in recent history as the O 404 DD is for coach instead of citybus use. So any m-b dd 'citybus ' (i.e. non original m-b bus) would tend to rely on others dd citybus for the bodyshell looks..unless if the bodybuilder try to work with m-b citaro designers to produce a dd version of the citaro ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from the photo of the wheels, the bus chassis could be euro-5 brazilian sourced as nowadays even in brazil the standard is pushed more upmarket with the more stringent emission standards.</p>
              <p>if it's m-b then one would expect a far superior level of suspension ride quality especially lateral stability which i find better than in any other dd in sgp-my region currently, based on many trips i've taken on causeway link m-b dd. Unfortunately for the new generation MAN here their ride quality is not as good as m-b or the older MAN's !</p>

              Ageeed, as I have said in another thread, the behaviour of bus fans these days are quite honestly, deplorable. Whilst the post was by Adams Coachlines , many of the Singaporean bus fans who commented on that post are acting in a way detrimental to business relationships in the bus industry, much less to say whatever that is left of the relationship between operators and bus fans. <br>
              <br>
              There is no need for bus fans to obtain information through unscrupulous method, much less speculate on unconfirmed issues or to make disparaging remarks against a bus manufacturer that are downright rude. Mind you, whether a product is good for a customer is none of your business, the customer would had done their due dilligence before making any decisions. Such comments can affect the image of a company and may be considered as libel.<br>
              <br>
              Just think of this, if you are the one who spread rumours or untruths about a product, causing a deal worth millions of dollars to fall through, do you feel guilty about it, and are you willing to pay for legal damages if they so wish to commence one against you? I urge all bus fans to exercise restraint regarding classified information, and to stop spreading whatever you think may be classified information. Also, bus fans should learn to step into the shoes of industry players before commenting, how would you think if the comments you make is used against you? I would therefore recommend the mods to close this thread, since Adams Coachlines has already removed the offending photos.
