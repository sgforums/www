              Adding on, if the law recognises what you post online as evidence, why can't the companies take action against offending individuals.

              For you to use social media for publicity, wouldn't it require you to have a certain level of trust in it before using it, if you don't believe in social media, then why bother using it?

                  happened/is going to happen, it would be best for you people to

                  <p>I do agree with most of the points that was mentioned by you and SBS2601D, but however I still don't see a reason why making educated guesses based on known and official facts should be refrained.</p>
                  <p>It is one thing to speculate and present them as facts (as some has done by saying "blar is confirmed for blar") and that should NOT be condoned, but it is another to make educated guesses based on publically available factual information and present them as guesses. Afterall, It is still up to the reader to believe or not believe the person's guesses, and he or she can draw up his own conclusions from the same set of public data as anyone could.</p>
                  <p>That being said, this photo should never have been shared since it could potentially have affected financial transactions. What if another company X is making another decker for bus operator Y and sees this? Do you think they would be happy about it?</p>

              Does it matter whether its an admin who made the guess or a guest who made the guess? As long as disparaging remarks and misinformation/rumours are made online, companies can use it against offending individual if they deem that to be in breach of non-disclosure agreements or if they deem it to be defamatory or any other legally permissible reason if they so wish to act against the individual.

              I think I have to state it again, the removal of the photo pretty much says everything, the party who removed it/requested to remove it would want to stop discussions on the issue, and therefore it is only right to not make any discussions. Moreover, educated guesses are still guesses, and can lead to misinformation.

              <p> But still the admin's words count.</p>
              <p>It's not as if that everyone gave something that's out of the box. Base on the bodywork, it's from MAN's Lion City. Even if the bus isn't from MAN but using the Lion City's bodywork, it's rather "forgiven" given that that's the "iconic" look from MAN isn't it... So how are they misleading??(Referring to the comments made by viewers)</p>

              much says everything, the party who removed it/requested to remove
              it would want to stop discussions on the issue, and therefore it is
              only right to not make any discussions. Moreover, educated guesses
              are still guesses, and can lead to misinformation.</p>

              I'm not quoting this current event as example. The photo should never be in the public domain in the first place. Neither should any discussions be based off it.

              <p>It's not as if that everyone gave something that's out of the

              "forgiven" given that that's the "iconic" look from MAN isn't it...

              Here is the thing, even if eventually, your guess is correct, it is not a reason for you to speculate it right now. Speculations online, once seen by the parties involved, could affect negotiations of deals and eventual outcome of deals. Once again, I have to emphasise that there is a reason why the photo was removed.

              <p> Dude...ur example is totally different. </p>
              <p>As mentioned, the comments made are all regards MAN/SMRT. And it's either from the bodywork itself or the report made by LTA/SMRT regards to the high capacity buses. At least they come from the picture, and anyone can kinda agree a little to it.</p>
              <p>But you're telling me that these comments made are just purely vomitted out from their mind, without any proper evidence. And you said that it's still counted as rumours/misinformation? I totally disagree with it. </p>
              <p>As for the comments by admin, yes it's rather totally out from the box. If the admin didn't put the comment there, it's more or less not going to affect the deal...</p>
              <p>You order for this type of bodywork from MAN on a X brand buses, obviously people can think it's a MAN bus. How to affect? </p>

              <p> Dude...ur example is totally different. </p>
              <p>As mentioned, the comments made are all regards MAN/SMRT. And
              it's either from the bodywork itself or the report made by LTA/SMRT
              regards to the high capacity buses. At least they come from the
              picture, and anyone can kinda agree a little to it.</p>

              <p>Please look through SBS2601D and my posts and try to understand the concept of non-disclosure agreements, and the reason behind why the photo was removed, you still do not understand the abovementioned concept, and it is pointless to repeat the same thing over and over again, which I would had done so if I was more patient with you.</p>

              <p>You have been looking it from one angle, which is the
              consequences of spreading info/making educated guesses have
              you considered my other angle? Once again, why would they had
              removed the photo? It is to stop it from spreading further and to
              send a signal to everyone to handle the information with care.</p>
              <p> If you still choose to argue using the consequences of
              making educated guesses, please look through my previous posts, and
              what are small issues to you can make a big difference.</p>
              <p>I'll give you an example, I am going to buy a piece of car
              part from you, then I see from facebook or forums that
              there are comments about this car part being inferior,
              but you know that the car part you produce is made to ISO
              standards, what I would do is as a buyer I would request you to
              lower the prices, even though you know that it should be priced
              higher.</p>
