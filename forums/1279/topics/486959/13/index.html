              <p>Unless SMRT is going to use the A24s to push 190 for WAB till a new batch of DDs come in replace the balance bendy slots on 190. Cos I dont think there would be sufficient E500s to go around to give 190 the WAB status. I wont support this idea but it really depends on SMRT's priorities for now. </p>
              <p>Anw even in future, when more DDs are used on trunks, I wont be surprised to see A24s cameoing on trunks that are bendy-friendly because of mileage reasons unless LTA imposes a 100% ban for bendys on certain routes</p>

              <p>Brake light is still at the same location above the MAN badge. I believe the brake light look-alike thing is the rear CCTV, updated from SMB388S design as some BCs had feedbacked about the CCTV display not being clear as there are reflections from the rear window as there was some space between the CCTV unit and the rear window. Anyways it does look even closer to a Lion's City G now.</p>

              <p>Hmm this I am not so sure, I'm not an expert on the engines. If it was the same then I wonder why the big difference in performance. Perhaps like what I had first believed it could be a LUH-33 that was detuned to a lower output.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There's a good chance that the NG 363s are using only a Voith D864.5 as the advertised nominal peak torque would not be required in a bus context.  Instead, what the manufacturer may do is electronically limit the torque to, say, 1500 Nm but the higher power rating would allow the nominated torque figure to be available over a wider engine speed "window" compared to the same engine with a lower power rating. This has a positive effect on driveability, especially with a heavy vehicle such as an articulated bus.  With today's CAN bus systems where all the components of a bus communicate with one another, it is trivial to limit engine torque to required levels.  The engine torque limit also allows for turntable protection, i.e. when the turntable is not straight, engine output is limited in proportion to the of angle of articulation.</p></div>

              <p>unlike MB where the engine specifications can be decoded by the 6-digit SKU pointed out by Bus Stopping in another post, you can only determine the MAN engine type through the engine S/N. </p>
              <p>for instance, the engine serial number "503xxxxxxxxxxx" denotes a D2066 LUH engine, "504<span style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">xxxxxxxxxxx"</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> denotes a D2066 LF engine, so on so forth.</span></p>

              <p>thanks for the reply; a quick question here: how prevalent are power-sensitive components on bus engines, i.e. components rated for a fixed power output that will require a change on engine uprating?</p>

              <p>A lot of the engines on the market now don't require any changes at all, manufacturers design their engines to meet a range of power/needs. Only the ECU needs to be changed but that isn't a mechanical part.</p>
              <p>"one engine rules them all" is therefore really the case now, saves the customer on maintenance and training, in the case of MAN, they offer the same engine on the single deck A22 &amp; A69, articulated A24 and double deck A95. Simplyfing the maintenance regime in terms of things like logistics and training. And depending on a customer requirements, the same ZF 6AP2000B gearbox can be used on all 3 products, further simplyfing the process.</p>
              <p>MAN is not the only one doing this for a wide range of products covering single decks to double decks, Scania has been doing this as well.</p>
