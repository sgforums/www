              <p>I think for townlinks/intra towns that calls at MRT stops mid-journey, they need to clear pax ASAP. We can do nothing much about boarding though. But with a faster exit rate, it will stay at thestop for lesser amount of time. While people may argue that it takes up vital space at the stop (which is true), it is up to whether they want faster turnover (less time spent at vital stop), or less space used at stop (more buses can use the stop at any one time).</p>

              <p>Tamp sector dont even hv high turnover ratws to start with. Many of tamp pax board/alight at one single stop, at a place called Temasek Polytechnic. </p>
              <p>Besides, no of l<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ong haul pax is exceedingly high during peak. So no need to fear the top deck not being filled up. </span></p>
              <p>Hence given that the long distance pax would fill up the upp deck, and the short haul pax would stand below and alight at a centralised position, there is optimum usage of DD buses and thus makes sense to deploy DD and not bendies, which will decrease pax comfort, and worsen the already atrocious traffic conditions on the PIE and in Little India.</p>

              <p>(I am sorry to discuss this on the A24 topic but its a reply to what was posted above)</p>
              <p>Yes agreed. Since the existing routes are very hard to change or remove because of public outroars due to loss of direct linkages, I would have preferred BSEP to introduce more full-day express or semi-express routes instead of all those short haul trunks that are quite poorly planned and are no more than just taking up the precious space on our already congested bus interchanges. After all BSEP was planned to provide people with alternative bus routes to solve the overcrowding on the MRT right? Moreover those short haul trunks are encouraging people to still transfer to MRT and this will never solve the overcrowding problems on our MRT lines.</p>
              <p>The only well planned BSEP routes are 43M (though I would say this service could just do split shifts), 50, 860, 972 (and I gather 4 and 20 are also good but I havent taken before). I would attribute 972 to public pressure there and I believe that it still is the only BSEP service with a long express sector. Express Services like 502 and 518 could be introduced from other HDB towns towards Chinatown, CBD, Orchard areas and I am sure people will be willing to pay express fares for a more comfortable ride than on the congested trains. Or even Services like 5, 39, 59, 85, 161, 168, 857, 965, 966, 969, 985 when PTOs were still planning the routes. Such routes also command a better usage for the massive purchase of DD buses. When 67 sees DD buses, I believe it will become even slower and then become another service like 51 - such services are no longer viable in today's Singapore with MRT connections and should just split into 2. I dont think people will ever take 67 from CCK to tampines or 51 from JE to HG Ctrl.</p>
              <p>Planning short haul routes and just throwing DDs there is the most disastrous thing. one problem with DDs is the dwell times due to passenger activities and DDs on short haul services only lengthen travel time. In a city like SG where you can only use DDs in large quantities due to space constraints for Bendys, the routes must be designed to maximally utilise the DD bus. Thats why HK doesnt even need bendys in the first place. LTA seems to be designing routes that are more suited for bendy/SD and dumping DDs into them and this is the sadest case. If you decided to use DD bus in large quantities, design suitable routes. </p>

              <p>Hmm for services like 911/912/913, I believe the buses bunch up
                  because of quite irregular passenger activity and also due to the
                  route. Moreover, In WDL bus interchange some of these buses alight
                  at the alighting point before heading to the boarding point while
                  some directly drive to the boarding point to board/alight (not

              <p>Well, at least you don't see 4 Bendy/SDs bunch up on 963

              <p>Are you trying to say 963 was performing better with bendies? Then the answer is NO. The service level on 963 has improved multifold from the time it has got majority DD high capacity buses. </p>

              <p>169 is doing excellent with DDs in the AMK-Yishun belt. Haven't observed in WDL... but at Yishun MRT towards Seneko you can see full upper deck both AM and PM peak. </p>

              <p>Agreed... Bendies better option for 903... and as I said lets not even discuss DDs for feeders/intra-towns because there aren't enough DDs even for long trunk services, let alone short trunks and feeders.</p>

              <p>Kowloon has a population density of 46,010 persons per sq km (6
              times that of Singapore), HK Island has a population density of
              15,990 persons per sq km (with much of that going to bungalows
              built on pockets of uneven terrain), with leaving a spacious 3,930
              persons per sq km in the N.T. There is less usable land in Hong
              Kong than the whole of Singapore, and even fewer are truly flat
              grounds. That explains the popularity of point blocks, which makes
              it easier to build since you have fewer issues of uneven terrain to
              contend with for each building.</p>
              <p>And even with 3,930 persons per sq km, Yuen Long routes like
              68M/968/68X/268C could come once every 4 to 8 minutes during peak
              hours, fill to the brim within a couple of stops and head out to
              the expressway. To support express bus services, you need that kind
              of density. There is enough demand to operate FFw-style peak routes
              like Rt.268X which skips Cheung Sha Wan and Sham Shui Po. On
              weekends where demand is lesser, Rt.268B runs express to Tsim Sha
              Tsui once every 30 minutes.</p>
              <p>Rt.260X sees brisk business competing with the MTR WRL for
              travels between Tsim Sha Tsui and Tuen Mun (with long queues to
              boot at nights) while Rt.269B offers an alternative for those who
              do not wish to have to transfer to the LRT system.</p>
