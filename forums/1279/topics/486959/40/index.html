              <p>Bendies will still be needed even with whatever kind of 12.8m three door two staircase fancy DDs....</p>
              <p>The problem with short-distance feeders or feeder-like services is, people are not moving upstairs not because of DDs having not enough staircases to go up/down nor that it takes a long time to load/unload (most feeders have unidirectional loading anyway), but because there's no point of going upstairs when you will alight 1 or 2 stops later.</p>
              <p>Some SBST feeders works (or worked) well with DDs, but because there's simply no option. Given two choices: going upstairs so that you can board; versus not going upstairs and having to wait for a long time (as some feeders had relatively poor frequencies in the past), many would choose the first - which only means that DDs are better than SDs. If SBST had bendies, I'm sure they would deploy bendies instead of DDs on these slots.  (That should be the same reason why 72B operates with majority SD fleet)</p>
              <p>The 12.8m three door two staircase fancy DDs (referred to as "12.8m DDs" below) that are often in discussions these days helps the most, IMO, in situations when there is huge boarding/alighting activities at the same stop, when single-staircase DDs face problem because boarding pax need to wait for others to alight first. Some examples that I immediately think of are 52, 78, 154, 201 at Clementi, 222 at Bedok MRT, and 72 at Hougang. 12.8m DDs are badly needed for these services. However, this situation DOES NOT apply to most feeders as their loading patterns are often unidirectional. so you don't see a lot of pax both boarding and alighting at the same stop.    (Those saying services like this need bendies just because of long boarding/alighting times, stop trying.)</p>
              <p>The only issue of using bendies for feeders (NOT trunks) is space constraints, including the space required at bus stops / interchange berths, in bus interchange parking lots, and in bus depots. For the first issue, although it's true that feeders usually ply areas without other services, they still need to load/unload at bus interchanges and major bus stops, where you often see a lot of buses waiting for alighting berths or waiting to enter the bus stop. Bendies will make the situation worse. For the other 2 issues (parking lots), although there can be changes to existing infrastructure, it often result in reduced number of lots.</p>
              <p>In summary, my point of view: Use bendies wisely for feeders and feeder-like services; 12.8m DDs for others.  If no bendies, add buses to achieve reasonable frequency first (not 291/293 kind), then upgrade SD-&gt;DD.</p>

We are quite lucky most of our roads (maybe not the transport infrastructure) are able to accomodate bendy buses. If bendies are to be kept, may I suggest that we simply have no-bendy zones in areas with extremely high concentration of vehicles (to be determined at a later date), where space is a premium, such as Orchard Road and Shenton Way. Those routes won't have bendy buses.</p></div>

              <p>As in, by walking in your chain of ideas in ur prev post what I can interpret is you are hoping people could "cut" in when the corridor near the stairs are filled, correct?</p>
              <p>So when the pax fill up the corridor it means they prefer standing front. Wouldnt that space be filled up then?</p>
              <p>Similarly, by applying your chain of thoughts here you are saying ppl will go to the back instead of standing in front?</p>
              <p>So means people will move back anyway. Thus whats the incentive to "cut" to the back?</p>
              <p>Kindly clarify your contradictory statements?</p>
              <p>Assuming the upper deck prohibits standing. What is the loss from alighting at the rear, when an exit door will also be at the rear? Unless you are oblivious to how a 3-door bus look like? Same stairs, same door. But less crowding from fighting over space with lower deck pax, and from not blocking the way of boarding pax for buses which has heavy boarding and alighting activities at a single stop.</p>

              <p>Anyway, DD don't seems to have issue with moving to the rear,
              it's rather SDs/Bendy. The problem with DD is due to passengers

              <p>You need to read and follow my posts from the very beginning to understand my point. </p>
              <p>Basically I am saying how a 3 door varient, with a door all the way at the back, will automatically force commuters to move to the rear and in a single direction when we alter the programming of the ezlink card readers, such that passengers cannot board from the back which may disrupt passenger flow. Regarding the problem at the entrance, currently we dont see pax really willingly crowd round the front too, dont see any difference with tri-door varient. </p>
              <p>In the first place what are your views on 3-door-dual-stair DDs on feeders and intratowns forst, as compared to standard DD/SD? Coz y'know, it is precisely we see the prob with A22/Citaros that we are hoping LTA look into the viability of such buses in SG.</p>

              <p>As in, by walking in your chain of ideas in ur prev post what I
              can interpret is you are hoping people could "cut" in when the
              corridor near the stairs are filled, correct?</p>
              <p>So when the pax fill up the corridor it means they prefer
              standing front. Wouldnt that space be filled up then?</p>
              <p>Similarly, by applying your chain of thoughts here you are
              saying ppl will go to the back instead of standing in front?</p>
              <p>So means people will move back anyway. Thus whats the incentive
              to "cut" to the back?</p>
              <p>Kindly clarify your contradictory statements?</p>
              <p>Assuming the upper deck prohibits standing. What is the loss
              from alighting at the rear, when an exit door will also be at the
              rear? Unless you are oblivious to how a 3-door bus look like? Same
              stairs, same door. But less crowding from fighting over space with
              lower deck pax, and from not blocking the way of boarding pax for
              buses which has heavy boarding and alighting activities at a single
              stop.</p>

              <p>Firstly, I never mentioned which layout for which type of buses. </p>
              <p>Mind the words I've used...<strong>There's seats behind. </strong>The space would most likely be empty. They move to the rear because of that. At this point, you might not see the purpose. </p>
              <p>But comes to when the bus is crowded. Look at our A22/Citaro, there's always plenty of empty space there. These space, including the layout #1(Citaro one), can allow ppl to slip tru to the rear easily? Even if it's occupied, there's still a chance to go tru them. It simply enlarge the walking space(as seen now). </p>
              <p>Put to DD application, I've realize it works well too. Passengers boarding the bus can simply squeeze tru to the rear instead of queuing up for the stairs. </p>
              <p>Why is there a need to assume when it's prohibited? Passengers at the front would walk pass the first stairs, to the 2nd just because of the door and incoming pax from lower deck. Do you think it will be a smooth pace? I'm sure many lazy ones will use the first stairs more if they are sitted at the front, resulting in delay in alighting if failed to come down all the way.</p>
