              <p>Firstly, I never mentioned which layout for which type of
              buses. </p>
              <p>Mind the words I've used...<strong>There's seats
              behind.</strong> The space would most likely be empty. They move to
              the rear because of that. At this point, you might not see the
              purpose. </p>
              <p>But comes to when the bus is crowded. Look at our A22/Citaro,
              there's always plenty of empty space there. These space, including
              the layout #1(Citaro one), can allow ppl to slip tru to the rear
              easily? Even if it's occupied, there's still a chance to go tru
              them. It simply enlarge the walking space(as seen now). </p>
              <p>Put to DD application, I've realize it works well too.
              Passengers boarding the bus can simply squeeze tru to the rear
              instead of queuing up for the stairs. </p>
              <p>Why is there a need to assume when it's prohibited? Passengers
              at the front would walk pass the first stairs, to the 2nd just
              because of the door and incoming pax from lower deck. Do you think
              it will be a smooth pace? I'm sure many lazy ones will use the
              first stairs more if they are sitted at the front, resulting in
              delay in alighting if failed to come down all the way.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Ok I see your point on the space. Thanks for clarifying.</p>
              <p>Regarding the stairs, are you sure ppl would walk past, instead of gg up the first stairs they encounter? Esp since making the second stairs alight-only since its connected to the rear door, which I've alr suggested it to be exit-only countless times alr? So you mean people will willingly take the stairs behind to swim against the tide?</p>
              <p>For those on upper deck. Since they should only alight behind, will they rather go down and squeeze with the lower-deck crowd, or walk to the back via the standee-free upper deck, and alight seamlessly from the back stairway?</p>
              <p>Maybe you should try thinking about the human mindset more in depth. It's quite interesting to do so actually...</p>

              <p>Would you sacrifice the masses over a hypothesis with a 0.0000001% of happening? Before you say "yes before the damage is done" o<span style="line-height: 1.231;">r whatever along those lines, I wanna remind you, Freedom Tower now stands merely metres away from Ground Zero. So you're saying we should not build the tower in fear another bunch of terrorists dive planes into it?</span></p>
              <p>Or are you just biased against DDs? So that your wonderful bendies will continue to roam around? Well not that I am not supportive of bendies... But realistically speaking, bendies on 858 is only a stop-gap measure before a proper terminal rises at CGA. The moment a DD-friendly ter exists all CGA svcs will get waves of DDs. By then we can kiss bendies and most of the rigids goodbye.</p>

              supportive of bendies... But realistically speaking, bendies on 858
              is only a stop-gap measure before a proper terminal rises at CGA.
              The moment a DD-friendly ter exists all CGA svcs will get waves of
              DDs. By then we can kiss bendies and most of the rigids
              goodbye.</p>

              <p>Yes anything can happen...</p>
              <p>But from what I see, the airport need a total change. </p>
              <p>A centre point for public buses, would be required. Reduces the time queuing to clear the security into 1 or none. This centre point needs to be linked to MRT stations, a SkyTrain interchange. Ideally, walking distance from any terminal. Might not need a bus interchange actually(Eg. A long bus stop can save time ; sv36 to terminate elsewhere).</p>
              <p>With T4 &amp; T5 upcoming, I'm sure finding a land space that fits the criteria above could be an issue. </p>
