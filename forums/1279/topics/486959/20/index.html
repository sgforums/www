              <p>Well so many feeder routes cant even use 12m DD buses due to the
              turning radius issue. And you think 12.8m DDs are gonna do the
              job?</p>
              <p>SMRT's point is valid. Bendys perform alot better for feeders
              because it is more elderly-friendly and more efficient. What's the
              point of forcing people to go up for just a few stops? Doesnt make
              sense when space is not really a constraint at the roads where
              feeders ply. No point just suggesting use of DDs for the sake of
              using DDs. But in future, with all those MRT stations, most feeders
              can operate with just SDs so no need worry so much abt bendys or
              high capcaity buses for feeders. Then DDs can be used for just
              trunks. </p>

              <p>Lemon1974 will surely disagree over this..But again if SMRT really keen to use bendy for their feeder svc then why order only 40 units?Coming 2016 operators arent allowed to purchase anymore buses..Why not order another 60 units?LTA will surely compensate whatever buses that the PTOs buy before mah</p>

              <p>The problem lies with the curent fleet of O405Gs that are still present on the roads. Might be easy to suggest early deregistration and buying new buses but this is being really shallow. Those buses still work well and have a few years of lifespan left so it is definitely not being cost effective to deregister early. It will only cause far hikes. I believe SMRT will place some more orders after the 40 units are delivered so that they can arrive in time to replace MKIIs.</p>
              <p>As for LTA side, everyone can see that LTA wants to minimise no. of bendy buses but noone can say for certain if they dont want it at all. They might still purchase some in future for use in feeder routes or routes that are not DD-friendly. I would say they are still very undecided and probably waiting to see how the 40 A24s fair. The answer to why they are not buying any at the moment also probably lies with the existing fleet of O405Gs on the road.</p>
              <p>Just some food for thought - LTA wouldnt have approved SMRT's purchase of bendy buses if it wanted to eliminate bendys totally and SMRT wouldnt have purchased 40 units, knowing that LTA wants to eliminate bendys. There's definitely something that doesnt meet the eye because we are not talking abt 2 kids over here.</p>

              <p><br> I think the reason why 301 has less pax than 300 and 983 is because
              300 and 983 ply Ave 4 where the most number of pax lives, but 301
              does not. Last time when I took 300, 70% of pax alight at Ave 4...
              And maybe some Ave 2 residents prefer to take LRT and walk rather
              than taking 301.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>True... but 983 already has 40-50 pax on the bus on ave 5 itself even before heading to ave 4... if 300 calls before yet 983 will safely reach interchange with around 60-70 pax... if 983 comes first.. for sure people not able to board on ave 4 and will have to wait for 300.. </p>
              <p>300 loading beyond ave 4 is less than 20 pax... 301 does get good 20-25 pax from ave 2... but not many from ave 5... as people prefer 983 looks like. </p>

              <p>It has been loud and clear whether we want to agree or not.. It was clear when BSEP was introduced itself that LTA does not want bendies in SG... even though people fought tooth and nail on this forum... it is LTA's decision... and bendies are not here to stay. So instead of SDs spamming on all feeders... I think people will appreciate including yourself when crowded feeders/intra-towns get DDs... </p>

              <p>Lemon1974 will surely disagree over this..But again if SMRT
              really keen to use bendy for their feeder svc then why order only
              40 units?Coming 2016 operators arent allowed to purchase anymore
              buses..Why not order another 60 units?LTA will surely compensate

              <p>I would just say some people are very anti-bendy and are obsessed with DDs and this prevents them from seeing things in the right light. If you are the one so enthusiastic to go to upper deck to burn those extra calories, come I clap for you. Cos I really hate situations where lower deck no space to board and upper deck so much space. But like it or not, unfortunately, in our Singapore scene, people are lazy and we are an ageing population. This probably can never be changed, in the case of short routes. Plus also imagine how much extra dwell time a DD will take on a feeder vs a bendy bus. It can already be seen in SBST feeders ad this causes extreme bunching.</p>
              <p>Bulim will probably not get any bendy Anw cos of that package only 189 and 106 have bendys. These 2 will probably convert to DD since 106 is town service NS 189 is a trunk service. </p>
              <p>If LTA is so anti against bendys, there wouldn't have been a case where you see a new batch of A24s. It would be like London</p>
