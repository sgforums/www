              <p>Not sure what you are on, but comparing 856, 962 and 858 you would realise they serve completely different portions of Woodlands. If I was comparing direct Woodlands MRT-Sembawang MRT trips, I might as well add the MRT in as an option. The passenger flows I am talking about here are local (more or less feeder/short inter-town) sections of the route.</p>
              <p>And then you have 859, for quite a number of people, particularly those who live near Sembawang MRT, 858 is a faster and shorter route to Yishun, so its a no brainer for them to take 858, they get to save on fares.</p>
              <p>My point about 27 was not about alternatives or lack of it, but about how the travel patterns on 27 have changed since the TPE bus stop opened. People going to the airport from the NE have largely switched to 858, hence the loading problem on 27 is not as serious as before, while 858 faced an increase in passengers.</p>

              problem during the planning of the Jewel, I have lost all faith in
              them alr. Having a centralised bus station is ridiculous in T5.
              What about those in T1-3? The Jewel was such a strategic location.
              Located right in the heart of T1-3. Buses could depart from the
              Jewel, pass thru T5, and hit the expy. </p>

              <p>If you read my point properly, you would realise that I specifically mentioned that the current terminals have to be served.</p>
              <p>Plus, it is impossible (as yet) to depart from the current three terminals and then head to T5 and then go on to the respective destinations. It will be a huge detour plus the fact that you will need a road to be built between T1-3 and T5 for it to be viable.</p>

              <p>858 VS 856/962..can't compare...all serving different sides...most residents need not transfer(bus to Wdl then MRT etc.), that's a good thing.</p>
              <p>858 VS 859...can compare. More pax. board 858 to SSC/Yishun than 859. Reason being - directly opposite MRT Station. </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #888888;">*After typing..just realized it's the same idea as SBS351M..*</span></em></p>
              <p>It's either LTA/SMRT change 858 back to original route(Straight to Gambas), add 858X that runs between Sbw and CGA, or stick to current imo. </p>

              <p>Apparently, it is not a smooth ride for the bendies plying 858.
              BCs have to be extremely careful in the basement areas. Also does 3
              bendies in a fleet of 29 buses really make a big difference? While
              it is a great start, I don't think SMRT has many WAB bendies to
              deploy on 858. Also remember, the more WAB bendies it deploys on
              858, the more time it will take them to convert feeders/intra towns
              to WAB, which should be first priority as that is where you have
              most PIW passengers. </p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">With terminal 5 built from scratch, the skytrain, MRT and buses there should be better integrated... Changi Airport T5 ITH, with MRT at basement, bus int/ter at ground level, skytrain elevated?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Although for T1,2,3 (and 4), I'm not so sure if an integrated bus terminus at Jewel (as some are suggesting) would be better... it's more to connect all 3 existing terminals but doesn't lead directly to the main departure/arrival areas for each, and the current arrangement of buses going to each terminal's basement is more direct and convenient.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">If the main purpose of building a new,integrated bus int at Changi T1,2,3 is just to allow DDs to ply there, I don't think that's a v good reason... SMRT has shown that bendies can now ply Changi Airport, and when GCM takes over, we'll see whether this can be done for other (currently SBST) svcs, if needed. We could also see some svcs being shortened, split or amended.</p>

              <p>i agree with this...even though 180 dun really have much loadings during AM off peak, the load during peak and even PM off peak is huge. Often buses will be packed to the door upon reaching Jurong Town Hall (twd BP), or even before that during PM peak. I am surprised when i see random A22s doing 180 during PM peak already... </p>
              <p>It is similar to 243 in a sense that during PM peak, the queue can go very long and the reason why we dun see it full from Boon Lay is that some chose to wait for next bus in order to get a seat...</p>

              <p>860 is spammed with so many buses at 02-04 minute interval that it is doing well without high capacity buses. You can see the loading observation in loading level of buses from lemon and me. Very similar. There is 30-45 minutes interval in AM peak when the crowd really surges. For just that time, you don't need more HC buses.</p>
              <p>Having said this, 860 is only service on Ring Road, and with the number of flats coming along Ring Road, st 51, sooner or later... 860 will need a fleet like 291. But as of today, doing just fine.</p>
