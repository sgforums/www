              <p>i thought 105 and 143 under soon lee deport and 48 AY deport? or maybe the tender is by interchanges in the west area not by deports? chance is that a new company will operate those services and use those bus brought by LTA not those own by sbst or smrt. so bendy buses might not even use by the operator unless smrt win it</p>

              <p>if sbst win it not up to them to get what they want now. LTA using people money so it LTA decision maybe all will be 12M SD buses as MRT lines comning. and forget about bendy buses or DD buses. some service will be shorten and some will be removed. long distance will be serve by MRT and at the station change to feeder service </p>

              <p>Hmm I dont believe LTA will cut short the long bus routes with the opening of new MRT lines. Our population is too big and continuously growing - MRT lines cannot sustain if everyone goes to MRT. LTA knows there are people bound to take buses from point A to point B even if MRT might offer a shorter travel time because people prefer more comfortable rides and lesser crowds.</p>
              <p>They cut all the routes in the north-east that duplicated the NEL except 147 and the effect this move had on service 147 was drastic. For eg. In the past Service 103 used to serve YCK and Jln Kayu to Chinatown, Little India and Dhoby Ghaut. If they had not cut this service, people in the newly developed Sengkang West/Jalan Kayu/Buangkok flats would have chosen to take this service directly without transferring to NEL. Given 103 route is direct, changing to NEL wouldnt have made severe difference in travel times. If they were already comfortably seated, why will they want to go and squeeze in the train? Now without 103, people in those areas either have to change to 147 or NEL. Obviously NEL would be the choice because a transfer is required anyway and 147 is already pretty packed before YCK sector. Why squeeze on 147 when they can squeeze on the NEL and get to their destination fatser? It was a mistake made in the past and the effects can be felt till date (not to mention other services like former 82, 97, 111 that would also considerably reduced loading on NEL).</p>
              <p>LTA probably realised this error on their part but it is quite paiseh to reverse their decision. Which is why I believe they didnt touch the bus services when circle line opened. I was thinking with Circle line, Service 70 might just become YCK-Serangoon Central (Loop) but it did not happen. Definitely a wise choice. Though loading on 70 is lesser than before circle line in the sectors duplicating circle line, there still are people who will use the service.<br><br>Hence I think, Long Haul routes will mostly remain unless in cases where there are too many routes duplicating a train line. THe new train lines I guess also all 3 carraige train and not 6 carraige right?</p>
              <p>If many bidders choose to operate bendys and DDs, I think LTA will adopt both models no matter who wins. SBST also have to suck thumb and except. After all SMRT is somewhat govt linked and so LTA wont ask SMRT's A24s to go fly kite after they have approved the purchase. But Bendys should remain to feeders and short haul for sure and it would be good to explore Bendys on routes that are not DD-friendly and also maybe redesign the airport PTBs to allow Bendys (because confirm cant redesign to allow DDs)</p>

              wont ask SMRT's A24s to go fly kite after they have approved the
              purchase. But Bendys should remain to feeders and short haul for
              sure and it would be good to explore Bendys on routes that are not
              DD-friendly and also maybe redesign the airport PTBs to allow
              Bendys (because confirm cant redesign to allow DDs)</p>

              <p>Hmm If bendys are restricted to just short haul and feeders, i think most ITHs will still be able to accomodate? Because at most will only require to park a few units at any point in time mah. They can always do parallel parking on the sides also as long as the bus interchange is friendly for a bendy to maneuvre through. Also in the past, I dont believe the old interchanges were designed for bendies before TIB's purchase of the O405Gs. THey must have been modified to accomodate. If LTA does approve SMRT's logic (which I hope they will), they will find a way.</p>
              <p>Yes, long distance should go express or atleast partial express, I agree. More favourable to DDs also. Because a long distance service with DD currently is too inefficient with very long run times so nobody will choose this as a route.</p>

              <p>semi-express is good for public transport if LTA has bus lane timing on slip road the link the bus service to express etc like 190 from PIE to steven road, as one accident on that slip road mean no way traffic can pass though that road. also has this "give way to public bus" rule on first lane of expressway like the YOG service bus. fail to give way mean fine. has semi-express service like 23 59 5 LTA can help to reduce mrt load</p>

              <p>If HK can do well without bendies, why can't SG? We just need
              more education to encourage pax to move to the upper deck (except
              the less mobile and wheelchair-bound which I understand).</p>
              <p>HK has a population density of 6544 persons per sq km, much
              tighter than Singapore's 7615 persons per sq km. With our limited
              land space and smaller integrated transport hubs, having DDs &amp;
              SDs only will work better for the country.</p>
              <p>If deploying DDs for short routes are not economical, a full SD
              fleet can work out too. 1 eg is 238 during peak hours, which has to
              operate full SD bcos of the road restrictions along Lor 8 TPY.
              While 1 bus is picking up pax at the sv238 berth in the int,
              another bus will be scheduled behind to depart later to clear up
              the pax left behind by the front bus. Even sv806 (currently using
              bendies) has to practice this in Yishun currently.</p>
              <p>As for height and road space restrictions than does not permit
              DDs to be deployed, we should have supplementary routes introduced
              running parallel to such services, but skips the stretch of roads
              with height/road space restrictions. As for CGA, it is really up to
              LTA to bother designing a new DD-friendly bus int/ter for the
              services.</p>
              <p>As for a super short route like 902, I wouldn't even say it's
              needed if 169 is able to operate at better frequencies compared to
              now. Otherwise, it should have been introduced as SWT 169B.</p>

              <p>HK bus services are structurally different from ours, much more routes with express sectors. even those without express sectors do not stop at every single bus stop along the road, saving time. the distance between bus stop here is too short, adding unneeded time to both the service runtime and commuter journey times. (are singaporeans so damn lazy to walk they need bus stops every 200-300m???)</p>
              <p>back to the point, most of their services are in such a way that the first half of the bus route is when commuters board and then the second half is alighting, hence their fare structure. eg $2 fare if you board at any first 6 stops, $1 fare for next 6 stops and $0.50 for next six stops (very short sector near terminating point, not much people will board). so not much turnover and no problem of double deck buses stoning at bus stops because of a huge amount of people boarding and alighting at the same time, generally its either only boarding or alighting at a bus stop.</p>
              <p>also, hong kong doesn't have many routes that are structured in a way like our 'feeders' with have high turnover rates at every bus stop. residential estates are adequately served by MTR and trunk services that pass through the estates, including variations of trunk services that are specially diverted into estates during peak hours. there is no extreme centralization that our transport system suffers from, pumping all passengers from trains and trunk routes into feeder routes that can barely cope. (hub and spoke) just think of two huge canals chanelling water into one small drain.</p>
              <p>a radical change in our bus routes' structures is needed if we were to entirely ditch bendies for dds. </p>
              <p>i think most people who have gone to HK will understand what i am trying to say about the way their routes and systems are structured <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>I totally agree with TIB868X. I have been to HK 2X in the past 3 years and I always wondered why HK can do so well with DDs while Singapore got so much problem.</p>
              <p>And yes he is right, there are no feeder service routes like in Singapore. Their bus system structure is very different. Buses there are mostly alternatives to their MTR and not a mode to just take to nearest MTR and transfer. In Singapore people will take bus to MRT and transfer mostly. You will not encounter DDs in HK where upper deck is so empty and lower deck full of people, also partially due to HK people being more willing to go up (I suppose). And in HK their bus industry is competitive. You can have 2-3 companies running very similar bus routes and this makes crowd distribution better (you dont see this in SIngapore too).</p>
              <p>No point blindly saying HK and UK can use DDs only, why cant we! Please analyse their systems before commenting. If Singapore bus industry becomes like HK and UK in terms of routes I will say forget about bendys. But since this is pretty unlikely, best to do is DDs for trunk and Bendy/SD for feeder.</p>
