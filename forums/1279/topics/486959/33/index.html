              <p>Two days ago, two service 27 buses bunched at Terminal 3 at around 7pm (one K230UB, one Citaro); the K230UB was full but the Citaro (which I boarded in favour of service 858) only had fewer than ten passengers.</p>
              <p>If I would compare the total load of svcs 27 and 858 at that timing, it seems like two or three <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">partially filled</span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">NL323Fs bunching is insufficient to clear all the passengers at the queue (the queue nearly reached the second berth behind, note that 858 has yet to change its berth then), as compared to two svc 27 buses bunching there. To me, I feel that the first svc 858 bus that came did not pick as much passengers...</span></p>

              <p>Yeah, if the bendy bus deployments prove to be successful on 858, SBST shld get them for services 27 and 53 atleast. If not maybe they shld hand these 2 services over to SMRT for bendy deployments. As for 34 and 36, hopefully lta will consider bendy for that package to go-ahead if 858 proves itself positively with the Bendys.</p>

              <p>sounds fair. But better for 856 to stay with SMB while 169 can change contractor. Maybe also possible to let ARBP full control 132 so it stays with SBS.</p>

              <p>Of course DD-friendly terminal is best but With the current infrastructure of the airport, it is going to be quite hard to get DD-friendly infrastructure unless they build a common airport bus terminal out of the complex. And even if they do so, first there is an issue of space and secondly there is an issue of accessibility and convenience to commuters? If they need to take a bus from PTB 1/2/3 out to that common terminal, it will probably deter commuters due to additional travel time and reduce the convenience the current infrastructure offers. If they consider sky train route between a terminal and the airport complex, it is going to be pretty costly as well.</p>
              <p>besides I think airport vehicle height limit is 4.0m? So 4.5m DD might still have problem.</p>
              <p>simpler option would be to use Bendys for airport services that really need higher capacity buses. I would say CAG will leave the issue to the PTOs to settle. Well if congestion is going to be a problem due to space, PTOs can refrain from deploying Bendys on back to back slot. Besides, currently PTOs are operating the services at such a high frequency where 2 buses bunch together to handle the crowds. 1 bendy bus holds 30 passengers less than 2 SD buses but occupies 6m lesser in space. So I dun think space will be so much of an issue. If bendy is used, the number of buses in the service should be reduced </p>

              <p>You're talking as if half of 858's fleet has turned into A24s, that the mass bunching and unstable frequencies will cease. I can only wish for that, becuase with more A24s on 858 (that we don't know if they're ordered or not), it will allow SMRT to further optimize 858's fleet by cutting out some A22s, much like what they did with 966.</p>

              <p>With it spanning 50+km I dont think unstable freq will cease. However it is certain that it will DECREASE and will be at least more stable than any of SBST's CGA svc looping at CGA.</p>
              <p>With 858's distinct route nature mass spamming of buses is clearly both unfeasible and unsustainable. More drivers and buses needed, yet no improvement for commuters. I agree that these extra A22s could be better used on other svcs eg. 307. </p>
