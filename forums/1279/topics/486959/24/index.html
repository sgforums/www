              <p>so much speculation... but sorry to disappoint.</p>
              <p>Is there even a need for different nicknames? Lol. Just because different ppl disagree with ur views doesnt mean they have to take on another identity to get the point across. Hence, the purpose of a forum for discussion.</p>
              <p>So, all anti-bendy ppl must be the same clones la, since all think the same? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The only time when a forum becomes redundant is when it is hijacked by ppl who want to limit the discussion along the same line as theirs. These kind of 'act-like-they-know-it-all' type of ppl are the biggest Nuisance. </span></p>

              <p>Exactly. I talked statistics with reasoning for my views, and nowhere have I said I was pro-bendy, or anti-rigid, or anti-DD whatever. I merely<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> highlighted its absurd when bendy buses are shouldering the blame when they have been serving us well over the years. </span></p>

              <p>Hahaha,I'm not God and i cant predict the future too and that is up for you guys to believe or not regarding LTA views on bendy buses.If you still got the faith that LTA will buy bendy buses then its up to you..I wont lose anything by the way.This is a bus forum for discussions and i believe that the word Anti-DDs and Anti-Bendy buses doesnt exist in my book.I like bendy as much as i love DD too but again no need for further explanation.Perhaps you guys can ask Mr Lemon1974 on his view on bendy buses instead?</p>

              <p>Regarding about the nicknames,there are a number of cases happen before just for the sake of cyberbully,Trolling etc and thats why we have the right to be suspicious..I meant no harm nor fully accuse you,But if youre genuine then i respect you thats all,No hard feeling brother!</p>

              <p>Sounds funny leh.. when I hear ppl talk about space
              constraints.</p>
              <p>How come all these years we have had hundreds of these bendy
              buses operating on our roads, no one talked about space constraints
              or inconveniences? And because of a sharp rise in population,
              leading to congested roads and high increase in cars, suddenly the
              bendy buses are taking the blame? Convenient way of pushing the
              blame to articulated buses for causing road congestions, but they
              forget whose policies are causing a sharp rise in our car
              population? lol</p>
              <p>And talk about blind spots, and from other ppl whom I've been
              hearing them say that bendy buses are more accident prone. We
              should talk statistics instead of going by personal sentiment. Till
              today, most accidents on the roads involving public buses, are
              caused by the rigids and double deckers. (even ppl getting killed
              or crushed), but people dun say? Yet all it takes is an accident
              involving a bendy bus and suddenly the bendy bus is not safe. Lol.

              <p>1. Nobody is blaming bendy buses for congested roads. It was simply said that now with congested roads, which will only become increasingly clogged, means that they are no longer suitable for Singapore roads. Don't put words in people's mouths.</p>
              <p>2. Get out of your shell. You don't need to use statistics that you don't even possess, only your eyes. Have you driven both a DD and a bendy like carbikebus? Have you ever realized that the amount of bendy buses that have sideswipe damage are disproportionately high compared to DDs and SDs?</p>

              <p>Yeah chill guys, chill! This is a forum and everyone has the freedom to explain their views. I believe most people are not pro-DD or pro-Bendy or anti-DD or anti-Bendy. Most of us are just saying our opinions and they are mostly based on reality. In my case, Im just saying if want DDs, singapore bus routes have to evolve to suit it and that a purely-DD solution might not really suit our current network best. This does not mean I am pro-Bendy or whatever. Is just best fit for a good bus network.</p>
              <p>LTA is not going to make its decisions based on what people fight or argue about over here. They too have their teams to do loading studies and see which types of buses fit which services. Hopefully they will make the right choices too. And please don't keep blaming bendy buses for all the problems. They have served us well and are still serving us well. I really have respect for those bendy buses because they really made my rides to school during my sec school days more comfortable in the early 2000s when Bendy buses first appeared on 851. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If really have such strong opinions and think you are right, go join LTA and so something. No point fighting on forum. This is a forum for MAN A24 after all. </span></p>

              <p>To me its more of the dead mileage issue rather than capacity..We are famous for not moving to the rear problems.Its great if Amdep can take 4-5 duties.</p>

              <p>I suppose if it managed to make it out of CGA's 3 PTBs (which it did since someone saw it testing on the roads again today), I suppose the trial would have went well?<br><br>The only real squeeze for a Bendy would be when Sv 858 is exiting from the boarding area of T1 PTB up onto the uphill slope towards T2. other than that, I see no real issues in terms of ride clearance or turning radius though for both PTBs @ T1 and T3...</p>

              <p>Actually I think for SBST, they might wait till they see what SMRT deploys first for Sv 858 before making a move. Since previously in the past, they copy-cat each other's move for the CGA services. (bring back the times when SBST first deployed KUBs for CGA, SMRT went tit-for-tat and dumped the OC500LEs on 858 when they didn't buy alot of OC500s in the first place..)</p>
              <p>Because, imo, if SBST wanted to deploy Bendies for CGA services, wouldn't they have tried to do so in the 998Y 999U era already~ Unless they didn't think of that move until now.</p>
              <p>But oh well, maybe if the CGA services ended up into the control of another operator (other than SBST &amp; SMRT), we might see some changes. or LTA sponsor again lo, haha. </p>
