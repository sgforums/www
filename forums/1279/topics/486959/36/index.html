              <p>860 is running at such a high frequency because of the high volume of passengers it has to cope with. SMRT and LTA probably had to run it at such a high frequency due to the lack of high capcity buses being deployed. No BSEP bendy for now and Im guessing the route is not DD-friendly (doesnt make sense why LTA will not put DDs on it for such a long time if they could have)</p>
              <p>Since now SMRT has deployed A24 on 860, its a wiser choice to deploy more bendy and reduce the number of buses on this service. Such high frequency is not required. End of the day you use more SDs to compensate for HC buses, you take up more space, use more fuel, need extra drivers. And even after all these, 1 bendy is faster than 2 SDs. Quite insane to have 16 buses deployed on such a short route. And when more flats open, it'll be even more crazy to make the service more frequent and spam with more A22s.</p>
              <p>But I think SMRT cant deploy too many O405Gs on this service cos its a BSEP service and has WAB status. And A24s at the moment not sufficent to go around too. 2 A24s and 2 O405Gs will be good for a start, with 8 A22s.</p>

              <p>Agreed. I prefer they deploy bendy on 860 than DD as there are more DD needy services.</p>

              <p>By the way 180 does have a good point to point loading. It is the fastest way to connect between BPJ/Phoenix to Jurong West Ave (via bus transfer) or Boon Lay. During peak hours, buses get good 60-80 pax and most of them travel long distance. </p>
              <p>Off-peak the story is just like other services, poor loading, but that is the pattern for 90% of services in SG.</p>

              <p>Route not DD friendly? I wonder how many times someone or the other has said this. Please point out which part of the route is not DD friendly. Majority of its route is plied by previous 850E. </p>
              <p>It is LACK of DDs due to which 860 did not get DDs in first place. By the time AMDEP got DDs, 860 was already stormed with 16 buses at a frequency of 03-05 mins + frequency boost with deployment of 860A. There is no need of HC buses as of now. If the first bus is crowded, the bus behind will be empty.</p>
              <p>While I say this please note Ring Road has NEW flats with very low occupancy as of now and there are MANY MORE to come. So maybe in a year the situation will be different, and as I said before 860 may need a fleet like 10 bendy + 6 MANA22. I just don't know from where it will supply WAB bendies though.</p>

              <p>180 is still not really a good candidate yet, for DD. The bus frequency is fixed to 10mins per bus during peak hours, and thus resulting a longer queue(Sometimes cannot board). *Base on my observations*</p>

              <p>10 mins is bad frequency for trunk service? really? does the demand justify more buses for sv 180 when it already has full fleet bendy??? just making you think a bit. :) no war.</p>

              <p>A bit too long imo haha..I don't mind the fleet getting some A22s as fleet add(running at half the interval). </p>
              <p>But trust me, I believe they should adjust their fleet first, especially 180A. The timing for 180A should start as early as 530pm, till 8pm then after 11. </p>
              <p>P.S. I know it sounds a bit demanding...but I prefer both improved frequency and improved capacity to be implemented to 180. </p>

              <p>How does 1 bendy or 1 DD make any difference in a fleet of 16 buses? Moreover, if bendy follows MANA22 that has tanked the load, the bendy will even go empty.</p>
              <p>Make sense if it is a fleet of say 12 buses with 8 bendies/4 A22s, then you are saving resources/buses yet effectively managing load at a good 4-5 min frequency.</p>
