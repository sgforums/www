              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>If HK can do well without bendies, why can't SG? We just need
                  more education to encourage pax to move to the upper deck (except
                  the less mobile and wheelchair-bound which I understand).</p>
              <p>HK has a population density of 6544 persons per sq km, much
                  tighter than Singapore's 7615 persons per sq km. With our limited
                  land space and smaller integrated transport hubs, having DDs &amp;
                  SDs only will work better for the country.</p>
              <p>If deploying DDs for short routes are not economical, a full SD
                  fleet can work out too. 1 eg is 238 during peak hours, which has to
                  operate full SD bcos of the road restrictions along Lor 8 TPY.
                  While 1 bus is picking up pax at the sv238 berth in the int,
                  another bus will be scheduled behind to depart later to clear up
                  the pax left behind by the front bus. Even sv806 (currently using
                  bendies) has to practice this in Yishun currently.</p>
              <p>As for height and road space restrictions than does not permit
                  DDs to be deployed, we should have supplementary routes introduced
                  running parallel to such services, but skips the stretch of roads
                  with height/road space restrictions. As for CGA, it is really up to
                  LTA to bother designing a new DD-friendly bus int/ter for the
                  services.</p>
              <p>As for a super short route like 902, I wouldn't even say it's
                  needed if 169 is able to operate at better frequencies compared to
                  now. Otherwise, it should have been introduced as SWT 169B.</p>

              <p>As a person who stayed in HK for a decade, I totally agree with TIB868XÂ </p>
              <p>In fact, that was exactly what i said some time ago but ppl like u chose not to believe me...</p>
              <p>Even for MTR buses, 80% of those routes goes to countryside and the vast majority of the pax only board and alight at a few certain stops... And it is not worth to buy and maintain bendies at such a high price for the remaining 2 or 3 svcs (e.g. Svc 506 which in fact could be reverted to Light Rail ops any minute)</p>
              <p>So it isnt fair to compare with HK as the turnover rates arent high and little ppl take short haul... Unless u tell me u like paying HKD10.2 to get from APM at KT to ur home in Ping Tin</p>
              <p>P.s. Local forums joke over ppl who take short haul coz its just... Weird and not worth fares</p>

              <p>I too hope that the system/network would eventually be similar to hk's. But it is probably not likely anytime soon (or not even 10 years time). The root of the problem is with DBTF promoting passengers to use buses as a last-mile mode of connection. By simply paying few or tens of cents, you have buses right to your door step, who wouldn't want it? But the drawback is every bus route that passes through a MRT station will be used for this purpose regardless of it being trunk or feeder. Ends up... higher pax turnover, more spikes in capacity needed, each trip gets longer, and worse of all, people who take buses as their main form of transport gets impacted by longer travel time.</p>

After all SMRT order them a year ago and they even give press releases abt using bendies on feeders. cant be LTA wait until so last minute to prevent SMRT from registering them right?
