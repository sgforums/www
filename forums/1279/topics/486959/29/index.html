              <p>some comments on the a24s in general:</p>
              <p>horrible suspension, it feels like your ass is dropped onto the
              road whenever the bus goes over a hump. </p>
              <p>the bus is really stiff as a whole, especially the joint. the
              bus doesn't bounce naturally like O405Gs.</p>
              <p>the acceleration leaves much to be desired too. 360hp and 1800nm
              of nothing if the tuning is terrible. the voith transmission that
              is fitted does not help it either. the o405gs still have superior
              acceleration and comfort as a whole.</p>
              <p>side note: i rode some a24 that was on 811 just now and the
              telematics was beeping all the way and the symbol for swaying as
              flickering</p>

              <p>Aiya...</p>
              <p>Also not like its not gonna end up on trunks...</p>
              <p>For max 10+ mins of journey, want so comfortable ride for what... Many a time you're gonna end up standing anyway</p>
              <p>And need so powerful torque and acceleration on small streets and lanes for what... The bus would prob hit a light/stop before it hits 40kmh if it has good acceleration anyways</p>
              <p>Bendies need not be so well performing... Its just to fulfill its role as a mass transporter in the heartlands... For routes that hit the express, leave them to the DDs and A22s...</p>

              <p>4. again, see point 3. your standards are so low bendy buses are only meant to simply transport people in the heartlands. let's just have bendy buses with 500nm of torque and without air conditioning, alright? you dont give consideration to other factors such as comfort, efficiency and economics, which are reliant on the bus' characteristics. no surprise citaros on 811 are regularly overtaken by a22s and always fail to keep up with the chedule, as a result of chronic poor performance.. and i didn't compare it to DDs and A22s, you did.</p>

              <p>Yeah, but next time i think it's LTA decide what buses for what area/package, so hope can distribute DDs more evenly. (bendies still a question though)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The MAN NG 363 is definitely derated from its paper specifications.  One reason is because the gearbox can only safely transmit up to 1600Nm of torque for prolonged periods, and even then only in 3rd and 4th gears only, so right off the bat, the full 1800Nm is not in use.  In lower gears, the maximum permitted input torque is reduced even further, particularly in 1st to control traction.  You'll probably find that the in-use peak torque has been electronically reduced to 1400-1500Nm.  Furthermore, the turntable controller restricts the torque output of the engine if the joint is not in the straight-ahead position, depending on angle of articulation.</p></div>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Personally, I'm not convinced if DDs are best suited for plying the route of 854, given that throughout most of the day, this service is usuallly filled with many passengers (which means the bus will be stopping to pick/disembark commuters at almost every bus stop.)</span></p>
              <p>It is also undeniable, that the time taken for a DD to disembark passengers would be slightly longer as compared to a rigid/bendy, as the bus captain has to ensure passengers at the upper level are clear before he can move off. </p>

              <p>Personally, on two occasions, I hopped onto an 854 DD from Yishun interchange to Bedok to test its efficiency during a peak period. Turns out, despite the bus driver speeding up, the time taken for the DD to move off from one bus stop to another is agonizingly slow. And of course unsurprisingly, it wasn't just overtaken by one bus. </p>
              <p>It was actually overtaken by 2 rigids, and 1 habit bendy from behind. By the time the DD i was in arrived at Eunos, opposite the road at the bus-stop, the 854 that went off before this DD from Yishun is already there at the other side.

              <p>Headway improved significantly because buses are now taking the same but longer time to board. Its simple, when you have bendies loading, unloading and departing faster than double decks, there would be an uneven frequency when there is a mixed fleet. Also the timetable may had been adjusted to take into account the dwelling times of the double decks.</p>

              <p>Rubbish. Best example is sv 25 and sv 854 who if both leave at same time from Bedok Interchange will not have more than 2 min difference until when they depart at YCK Road junction. Many times it is just a myth... because boarding time is the same... and bendies usually have to wait for the bus in front to go to call at the bus stop as it cannot fit its entire body... So most of the claims are not practical... they are good in theory!!</p>

              <p>SMRT has an oversupply of bendy buses. They have such a large non-WAB bendy bus fleet, it brings them a lot of grief trying to meet the WAB quota on WAB feeder routes. IMO the order for MAN A24s is meant to ease that quota, but in the process the O405Gs are displaced and somehow ended up on long-haul trunk routes.</p>

              <p>SD &lt; Bendies = DDs</p>
              <p>for feeders/intratown (except for 806/901/902) </p>
              <p>804 case was bad enough to warrant full fleet bendies, but with just 40 units of A24s and it being a WAB, it would need some A95s to supplement.</p>
              <p>likewise for 911/E. it is also a WAB svc and experience high loading. A22s will be packed.</p>
              <p>SD &lt; DD &lt; Bendies</p>
              <p>for 184, 902</p>
              <p>at this moment only the above svcs where bendies fare well.</p>
              <p>902 case was pax not moving up. it acts as a shuttle service with a very high frequency.</p>
              <p>184 is a trunk that works as a shuttle service</p>
