              <p>What if LTA chooses to purchase articulated buses in the
              future?</p>
              <p>The next question you will be thinking is LTA must be crazy to
              do that because there is no space to set down and layover at the
              interchange.</p>
              <p>Then, my next question is must articulated buses always start
              and end their journey at the bus interchange, layover at the
              interchange, or even enter the interchange?</p>
              <p>Many bus planners around the world face the same set of problems
              in urban cities but they go beyond conventional thinking to find
              their solutions.</p>
              <p>The same still could be applied to an all DD solution, as our
              bus interchanges are getting more congested with additional
              buses.</p>

              <p>dun think LTA is getting any more bendies in future.. i believe that they have a deal with SMRT to allow them to buy bendies just solely for feeder/short route, while long haul route have to use DDs...</p>
              <p>and buses need not start at interchange, but problem is that bendies also take up lot of road space as well.  </p>

              <p>I wrote a little about this <a href="/forums/1279/topics/485108?page=21#post_11044257">here</a>.</p>
              <p>As for buses not terminating at interchanges - Why not? In many urban Australian cities, buses do terminate by the roadside. Bus stops are staggered to prevent buses from queuing to set down passengers.</p>
              <p>Yes passengers will need to walk to transfer, but if done correctly the walking distance should be no more than walking from the alighting berth to the next boarding berth within the interchange or MRT station.</p>
              <p>We will of course know LTA's answer by 2016. The prospective operators might already know the answer as we speak from the tender documents.</p>

              <p>yes... 904 don't need bendies at all... it is perfect for MAN fleet... and totally agree on your point on bendies... current infrastructure just suggests it will get phased out in due course... but that will be sad... they should maintain some bendies at least for short feeder services.</p>

              <p>Hmm Golf Course could be part of it. Condos, too much already. Same for shopping malls, like Tampines or Jurong. You could provide accessable transport(i.e. bus/MRT) to bring convenients to shoppers going towards certain area for certain type of shops instead of the other way.</p>

              <p>yes i agree they must decentralize bus interchanges. taman jurong terminal and the future changi business park terminal are good signs but they are half in half out efforts since for at least taman jurong terminal only one service terminates there and it is a new service, not one that is amended from a current interchange.</p>
