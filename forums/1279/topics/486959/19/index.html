              <p>Expect more A22s, and Citaros and KUBs to be used in future for these feeder services in futur, Â after the last 40 bendy buses are scrapped.Â </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.231;">With the influx of Citaros and A22s, and probably more single deckers in the coming years, there is probably going to have a fleet increase for these services, mainly to increase the frequencies of these feeders which is comparable to SBS Transit feeders.</span></p>
              <p>And not to mention, new services to be introduced to spread out the loads to these new services, but providing new links with these new services.Â </p>

              I think the reason why 301 has less pax than 300 and 983 is because 300 and 983 ply Ave 4 where the most number of pax lives, but 301 does not. Last time when I took 300, 70% of pax alight at Ave 4... And maybe some Ave 2 residents prefer to take LRT and walk rather than taking 301.

              <p>Well so many feeder routes cant even use 12m DD buses due to the turning radius issue. And you think 12.8m DDs are gonna do the job?</p>
              <p>SMRT's point is valid. Bendys perform alot better for feeders because it is more elderly-friendly and more efficient. What's the point of forcing people to go up for just a few stops? Doesnt make sense when space is not really a constraint at the roads where feeders ply. No point just suggesting use of DDs for the sake of using DDs. But in future, with all those MRT stations, most feeders can operate with just SDs so no need worry so much abt bendys or high capcaity buses for feeders. Then DDs can be used for just trunks.Â </p>

              <p>I don't see a reason why more MRT stations will remove the need of DDs and bendiesÂ on feeders. In fact, even more high capacity buses will be needed to cater to the demand from the new MRT stations to neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>Simply, you cannot put an MRT station every 400 meters. And you cannot expect everyone to walk from the MRT stations to their home (some 500m, some 1km, some 2km etc). The fact that even short feeders like 225 and 284 surviveÂ shows how willing people are to walk all the way back when there's a convenient feeder. Are you really gonna build an MRT station at Bedok North StÂ 3 to replace 225, which adds 2-3 mins of travelling time for other commuters?Â Don't expect LRTs since LTA has stopped planning any LRT lines for a long time.</p>
              <p>And I can tell you, the rate at which LTA is planning the MRT lines is really slow... TEL Thomson part only ready by 2021, East Coast part by 2025, CRL by 2030... And even when these lines can significantly reduce the need of some trunk services, they cannot do so for feeders. Even with these lines, the density of MRT stations is still not enough to have one station in every neighbourhood etc. In most of the towns, buses are still the way to go.</p>
              <p>If you really want everyone to take MRT, and wish all those who are taking direct trunk/express/premium services or evenÂ driving cars toÂ switch to feeders to transfer to MRT, How can only SDs (rigids) cope with this demand?</p>

              <p>For what they plan fast? Wouldn't that means that they have no job? Hahas..unless they got more space to dig..I think S'pore can prepare to introduce Double Decker trains for NSL/EWL to cater to the needs<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>From what I know, S'pore will have DTL, TEL, NSL, EWL, NEL, CCL only until 2030.</p>
              <p>Overall, it's seriously poor planning for the transportation system.."Micro-sized" interchange with "Mega-populated" crowds..BIG dreams indeed..</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you think the operators alone going to bring in more double decks, wait longer maybe? It's gonna be more SDs. SD(lower run cost) + pack bus(more profits) and with more drivers(-ve part).. Because during the off peak, your DD is literally useless.</p>
