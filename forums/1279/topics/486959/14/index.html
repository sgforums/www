              <p>if you have compared 388S's (even 8001E's) rear windscreen with the A22s, notice that the A24s have always had been consistently bodied <span style="text-decoration: underline;">taller</span> than the A22s. this hence implies that all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">windows on the A22s will not be transferrable to the A24s</span> as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A22 windows will be consistently shorter than the A24 windows.</span> </p>

              <p>Yah, already compared 388S, 8001E &amp; 8003A together last wk... The A24 remains taller than A22 since A22 is following the Europeans' Hybrid height.</p>

              <p>You wouldn't want the awkward 8003A to drive halfway and windscreen fall off suddenly since the top edge of the glass is not supported to the mould, eventhough I know bonded glass can hold strongly...

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yeah,Problem lies with their capacity..When Woodlands Depot start it was designed to accomodate 350 buses at one go but since Taxis,Bus Plus and other crap start to park there,the parking lots is reduce to just below 305 hence you see some buses still park outside the depot till LTA built the 245 lots Woodlands Bus Park for them..Kranji went a lot of parking upgrades,slight refurbishment but still is lacking today standard bus depot capacity,can only park slightly above 220 buses at one squeeze..Ang Mo Kio depot is worst of the 3 which can only accomodate no more than 170 buses at one go..to make matter worse the depot isnt DD friendly either hence the need of overnight parking at various interchange and terminal.</p></div>

              <p>Haha I think AMDEP practice overnight parking even before SMRT purchased DDs.</p>
              <p>Hope the newly registered A24s go to feeder services, where they should rightfully be used as opposed to 190 again.</p>
              <p>Is the new orders an indication of SMRT winning Bulim contract? Highly unlikely the non-WAB bendys will face early retirement except those that have lifespan till 2020. If not SMRT need not even refurbish. Refurbish means probably use atleast 2 more years</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmmm 2016 is not for all the assets what right? They only take over the assets under the contracting model mah part by part mah. 2016 is only Bulim and the timeframe is gradual till the last contract in 2022 or something. These old buses probably remain with operator and serve out their lifespans in areas not contracted yet. Thats my guess.</p></div>

              <p>Yah, already compared 388S, 8001E &amp; 8003A together last
              wk... The A24 remains taller than A22 since A22 is following the
              Europeans' Hybrid height.</p>
              <p>In european countries, their A24 are shorter which most probably
              using the same size windscreen as the A22, but as ours are taller,
              it doesn't fit.</p>
              <p>Looking at 8003A, the EDS visibility was totally cut off by
              half, the other half can see through to the interior &amp; the top
              of the windscreen moulding was exposed, that's why i dare say, it's
              fitted with wrong windscreen...</p>
              <p>You wouldn't want the awkward 8003A to drive halfway and
              windscreen fall off suddenly since the top edge of the glass is not
              supported to the mould, eventhough I know bonded glass can hold
              strongly... Is ridiculous mistake... <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>just saw pictures of SMB8003A's "A22-windscreen". The windscreen, although shorter than the A24's windscreen by about 10cm at most, is actually quite well mounted sans the front. As for the area ontop of the windscreen, whoever mounted that windscreen was ingenious enough to use sealant or plastic to make up the gap in the windscreen. </p>
              <p>under regular driving, the windscreen wouldnt fall off as how you have proposed. nevertheless, it just feels weird. </p>
