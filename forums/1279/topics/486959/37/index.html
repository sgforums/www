              <p>i think for 851 there a lot of old people going for short

              need to go up to upper deck for old people as their legs not strong

              <p>80% of pax board 180 at BNL, and alight at BPJ. </p>
              <p>Quite suitable for DD alr. Infact, after Parc Oasis till ITE CW, there's less than 5 passengers alighting(on average). Maybe we will see a difference with new flats upcoming. But, I believe DD is suitable for 180.</p>
              <p>Sv963 can still use bendy, but DD is doing good. Took 963 back today during lunch time, the upper deck quite empty, whereas the lower deck left a few seats. Can say that the upper deck would be frequently used during peak hours/high demand time..otherwise, most of them will take the lower deck.  </p>
              <p>IMO, 971E should start getting DD, not A24s. Time to attract more passengers la...train isn't reliable one..</p>

              <p>Yeah 971E should use DD. But If sgwiki is correct, SMB8025L is already shared to 858. So even if dun deploy to 971E, cant use it on 900.</p>
              <p>Haha I dun think SMRT spam so many rigids due to tthem having too many BCs. They just made a mistake and purchased so many A22s. So bo pian have to use them. It will be cheaper than buying more HC buses now and let those A22s sleep and depreciate.</p>

              <p>they do not have enough high capacity buses to deploy.. as simple as that... they try to save cost by buying more A22... up till now, SMRT only bought around 100 DDs under their own name.. the other 116 are under BSEP... and even though there are 40 A24, there are around 55 units of bendies being deregistered... so net increase is only around 85 units of HC buses under SMRT (Excluding BSEP)</p>

              <p>What service 858 needs is a layover point at Changi Airport. It has the same set of problems as service 99 before it was extended to Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>One
               way is to send arriving buses up to the departures hall/arrivals hall 
              for alighting only. Then let these buses head to a designated parking 
              lot/layover point. That would give some flexibility for the operator to space out the frequency proper,
              clear out the crowds while avoiding bus bunching.</p>
              <p>For example if 
              three service 858 buses arrive at the same time, two can be sent to the 
              layover point and spaced out accordingly while the third bus can be sent
               to the basement right away.</p>

              <p>TT are playing it smart. They know not all affected BCs want to go over to them and remain with BUDEP. Better to have a diverse talent pool sometimes. Won't surprise me if GAG tries a similar tack.</p>

              <p>Still, an overall shortage. I can't give too much away though.</p>
              <p>I heard a lot from bus enthusiasts at ABCD. I think they are way too optimistic. TT knows how to run their PR well - using the same J1X tactics from Torrens Transit (friendly female star drivers) to run their ABCD shuttle service. I will be very amazed if they can source drivers elsewhere and still end up with a very consistent level of customer service.</p>
