            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes 963 is definitely doing better now! I take this service quite often too. But blindly saying that this service improved cos of the use DDs is not all too fair. Ever since 963 used DDs, it must be agreed that there have been more high capacity buses, that too on AP shifts as compared to only the use of bendies. Also frequency has been increased on this service. The setback is that I recently see more bunching of buses, it is pretty common to see 2 DD 963 arriving together at peak hours! I also believe the upper decks are only fully utilised during peak hours. During non peak its pretty common to see a crowded lower deck with many standees and a 3/4 empty upper deck especially arnd bt panjang (I saw this when I was aboard 5005 on 963 last night too). The people that go up are also sometimes children who are fascinated of seeing DD buses and dragging their parents up too. But on the whole, 963 is a good route to use DDs. It definitely gives people who go up, a comfortable ride! Good job by SMRT!  Also it reduces congestion on the roads in Bt Panjang/Woodlands so bendys can be used on other services that need them.</p></div>

              <p>I think if mix DD and Bendy on the same service, the bunching problem will become worse.</p>
              <p>Yes, DD is more prone to bunching probably due to the dwell times induced as a result of boarding and alighting. Its quite common to see DDs bunching on 190, 963, 972 if you observe from the busstop near Bukit Panjang Plaza. But still these services are doing well with DDs. People who going long distance will go up and those using 190 as feeder between CCK and Bt Panjang, 963 between Hillview and Bt Panjang areas and 972 in the Bt panjang loops will stay downstairs so its ok.</p>

              <p>i think we need to face reality here. LTA has clearly not supported use of bendies and hence, no bendies were introduced as part of BSEP. Even when SBST were getting DDs, SMRT were getting only MANA22s. Only when SMRT decided to go in for DDs, BSEP gave SMRT high capacity buses in form of DDs.</p>
              <p>We can debate how much ever we want on DD v/s bendy but the truth is # of bendies will be drastically reduced to only feeders/intra-towns in future &amp; non-BSEP services. If you also read carbikebus post, new A24 introduction is a 2:1 replacement, when 2 bendies de-register, 1 will get registered.</p>
              <p>Already SMRT has a big shortage of high capacity buses. I hope they bring in more DDs asap and do the bendy allocation appropriately for feeders/intratowns in CCK, WDL and Yishun towns.</p>

              <p>It very well could coz the one BSEP slot that is a SD might get upgraded to DD in future. 962 for now is doing okay, maybe thats why slot is still not upgraded. </p>

              <p>IMO, LTA didnt buy Bendys under BSEP for SMRT before because LTA did not want to increase the no. of bendys on the roads. And yes, they shouldnt and there is no need to increase numbers when bendy usage is going to be restricted to feeders/short trunks. At that point when LTA was purchasing MAN A22s only under BSEP, TIB849B still havent deregister yet. This is also in line with LTA's objective of not using Bendys on town-bound services and long haul trunks.</p>
              <p>They might purchase in future when the O405Gs deregister, exclusive for deployment to feeders and short hauls, regardless of who the operator is. If they want to move totally away from bendys, why even approve SMRT to purchase the A24s? If they let SMRT purchase and then play hardball buy not deploying on BSEP services that need it (eg. 860), I would just say its damn stupid. It also looks bad on them because why the double standards. They are the governing body to approve purchase of buses - so if no bendy just ban SMRT from buying lah. Cant be SMRT have power to just ignore them and buy according to their wish what...</p>

              <p>I think the O405Gs will still be used in Singapore till their end of 17-year lifespan. They wont be bought over by LTA into the contracting model packages since they are non-WAB. But the bus contracting model is only going to cover whole of Singapore by 2022. SMRT can still use these buses on the routes not under contracting model yet till end of time mah. And I believe so, if not it will be no point sending them for refurbishment. Most O405Gs will end lifespan in 2017 anyway. The later batches might deregister early or may be sold overseas I hope.</p>
              <p>Its sad that box bendies didnt get their extension because I think alot of them are still in relatively good condition. Atleast could have exported, scrapping was such a waste. I take TIB885X, TIB894U and TIB899G very often and these buses are still in good condition with relatively quiet engines. TIB903C is probably one of those not in very good shape. </p>

              <p>Where got top sia? Maybe after transfering the workers over then became top. Took 1173K 106 last year, it was horrendous. The interior machiam an old history of castle, left untouch for many yrs without cleaning, mould patches everywhere. Likewise for KJ Box-Bendies, many of them were so much dustier than WL ones. Got ones I took 882D 190 and 898J 188, cobwebs everywhere on the corner of the windows and some even had spiders crawling around.</p>
              <p>WL dirtiest is 1056R 960, cockroach infested bus which I told SMRT before but no reply.</p>
