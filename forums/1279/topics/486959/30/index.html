              <p>few pax on the upper deck is due to it not being a max loading

              <p>for feeders/intratown (except for 806/901/902) </p>
              <p>804 case was bad enough to warrant full fleet bendies, but with
              just 40 units of A24s and it being a WAB, it would need some A95s
              to supplement.</p>
              <p>likewise for 911/E. it is also a WAB svc and experience high
              loading. A22s will be packed.</p>

              <p>at this moment only the above svcs where bendies fare well.</p>
              <p>902 case was pax not moving up. it acts as a shuttle service
              with a very high frequency.</p>
              <p>184 is a trunk that works as a shuttle service</p>

              <p>I don't know why many people like to see 184 as a feeder service. When in fact the distance from Clementi to SIM/Ngee Ann is much longer than some of the SBST feeders operating with DDs. If people are already moving upstairs on sv 52, 74 (from Dover) and 154, I don't see a reason why they won't do so if 184 gets DDs. And they can travel to SIM and Ngee Ann with a sit, instead of standing on a bendy for like 10 minutes.</p>

              <p>Anyway for now, SMRT has limited DDs to spare around and the O405Gs are here to stay till 2017 atleast. There are still many long haul trunk services in need of DDs and some SD-only or minimal high capacity services like 187 that can afford to have more DDs. So I would rather SMRT use DDs in those areas first and there is no need for Bendy &gt; DD conversion in areas where the bendys are doing a good job. Depending on what type of buses are purchased to replace the O405Gs in future, the bendys on these services can be replaced accordingly.</p>
              <p>SMRT also probably made a big mistake by purchasing MAN A22s at such high quantities. So even if want to do SD &gt; DD conversion, the question that will need to be answered is, what can they do with those A22s then? So they probably have to use a larger fleet of SDs instead of replacing to utilise their buses.</p>
              <p>As for for BSEP service like 860, it would be interesting to see what will happen when LTA takes back the BSEP buses for Bulim Contract and SMRT will have to operate the service with their buses. Could possibly see deployment of Bendys there, that will ease the overcrowding and loading.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Some of the deployment is also weird. For instance, why does 172 have 1 DD? This could have easily been replaced by a bendy. No need for DD on this service. Rather it could have used it to replaced a bendy on sv 67 to DD. </p>
              <p>There are some random DD deployments. I prefer they do like they did for sv 963. All high capacity buses are DD - that makes sense. Services like 172, 184 better be all bendy for now. </p>

              <p>184 loading as an institutional service is pretty much similar
              to feeder services because vast numbers travel for that short
              distances. </p>
              <p>Anyway for now, SMRT has limited DDs to spare around and the
              O405Gs are here to stay till 2017 atleast. There are still many
              long haul trunk services in need of DDs and some SD-only or minimal
              high capacity services like 187 that can afford to have more DDs.
              So I would rather SMRT use DDs in those areas first and there is no
              need for Bendy &gt; DD conversion in areas where the bendys are
              doing a good job. Depending on what type of buses are purchased to
              replace the O405Gs in future, the bendys on these services can be
              replaced accordingly.</p>
              <p>SMRT also probably made a big mistake by purchasing MAN A22s at
              such high quantities. So even if want to do SD &gt; DD conversion,
              the question that will need to be answered is, what can they do
              with those A22s then? So they probably have to use a larger fleet
              of SDs instead of replacing to utilise their buses.</p>
              <p>As for for BSEP service like 860, it would be interesting to see
              what will happen when LTA takes back the BSEP buses for Bulim
              Contract and SMRT will have to operate the service with their
              buses. Could possibly see deployment of Bendys there, that will
              ease the overcrowding and loading.</p>

              <p>A22s most likely to be transfer to 858, 882, 920, 922, 925, 926, 927, 941, 945 and 947. most of them are feeders. of these, 858 has height restriction, 925 has axle restriction. 950 could see A22s but they need to be JB-reg.</p>
              <p>i doubt LTA would have a batch of BSEP bendies. </p>

              <p>They should deploy MAN A24s on 911 first since its WAB. But then they prefer deploy MAN A24s on 901 instead to make it WAB status. </p>
              <p>For service 180, IMO should have DDs but mostly it have full fleet bendies so I not sure if can have DDs. But since 172 can, why not 180?</p>
              <p>Furthermore I really hope SMRT will use their MAN A24s wisely to deploy their services. Its recommendable to deploy on feeder and short trunk services rather than on long haul services. Also, I wonder if 962 can get DDs.</p>
