              <p>Mandai Depot will only be operational in 2019. if it were to replace Ang Mo Kio Depot, then where are the buses going to park (mind you, a 3 years period). it will get worse when you have more buses. Yishun Bus Park may not offer much parking after 2018 when it operates at NorthPoint City.</p>
              <p>Yishun Bus Interchange might not handle bendies, the plans shows more of 12m lots. Woodlands also getting its temporary interchange soon. Let's hope the plan for the new Woodlands Regional Interchange is able to change the situation that SMRT is facing.</p>

              <p>In the bus contracts model, the north area consist of Woodlands, Sembawang and Yishun. Would you think that Sembawang and Yishun services will go under Mandai Depot? that could free up much space in new AMDEP.</p>

              <p>I believe the 40 A24s are just the first step in SMRT's fleet renewal. When SMRT announced its fleet renewal earlier this year, it mentioned that the addition of 201ADLs, 40 A24s and 332 A22s are part of its fleet renewal plan till 2016. Given that most of SBST feeder services are already WAB as opposed to SMRT where only a minority are, I believe SMRT was facing the pressure to make their feeders WAB as well. At the current situation, if SMRT opts to make their fleet WAB, they will need to trade off the use of the high capacity buses (or use ADLS, but as their chairman has said, DDs are only for middle to long haul trunk services, which IMO is a very good choice). In order to make some of their feeders WAB, SMRT decided not to extend the MK1s for a further 2 years and replace them with the A24s instead. With the use of these 40 A24s, A22s and the older Mk2, Habit and Volgren bendies to boost the % of high capacity buses, I believe quite a number of feeders can go WAB in 2015.</p>
              <p>T<span style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.231;">he MK2s, Habits and volgrens are not due for deregistration till 2017 and seeing SMRT's pattern, I really dont think these buses will face early retirement (except for those slated to retire after 2020 because if I remember correctly LTA wants 100% WAB by then). All of the SMRT bendies are Mercs except SMB388S. As seen in the case of SMRT rigid buses, SMRT chose to retire the scanias without extension and give early retirement to the lances and hinos whereas the O405 NACs and CACs which were considerably older received a 2-2.5years extension. Moreover the MK2s, habits and volgrens are still in very good working condition and retiring them will be a real waste and not make economic sense when the last thing singaporeans want is a bus fare hike.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.231;">As for the new integrated hubs, while some of them might not be bendy-friendly, the rest are, since the current fleet of SMRT buses can still maneuver through them.  Given that most long haul trunk services will be using DDs in the future, I don't forsee a situation where the number of bendies on singapore roads will increase.  Bendies could just operate from the interchanges that are bendy-friendly and serve as loop services (since routes are short) or even operate from roadside terminals. Also, with LTA building so many new depots in HDB towns, operations for feeder services could be shifted to operate directly from the depots and pass by the Interchange/MRT/Town Centre (AMK will be a good example, as in the case of Svc 265, 268). Bendy buses can definitely park at these depots and if land space really is the problem for parking, multi-storey depots is the solution. Shifting feeder services to depots is definitely a good idea regardless of whether bendies or DDs or SDs are used because these services are the most frequent and have the greatest number of buses laying over at the interchange in between trips. If they dont operate from the interchange, problems such as long queues to turn into the interchange and congestion in the interchange can be minimised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.231;">Moreover, at the rate at which new services are introduced and the projected number of new services to be introduced in future, the current interchanges can't sustain no matter which buses are used. LTA will have to find the solution to that, which could indicate cropping up of roadside terminals or operations from interchange. 
                      
                      With the introduction of the bus contracting model, I believe we could see feeder services and short haul routes currently under SBST receiving bendies in future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.231;">Given SMRT is buying these 40 A24s and LTA is going to own these buses in due course, it might be in LTAs plan to get more bendies in future when they take over the bus assets. LTA will not increase the number of bendies past the current numbers and I am sure they are against bendy operations on long trunks but they never denounced its uses on Feeders and short hauls. They probably dont want to get it now because the current operator SBST might not want to operate these buses. But after 2016, SBST has no choice but to operate the buses allocated by LTA if they are to remain in the market. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 15.5555562973022px; line-height: 1.231;">The capabilities, advantages and disadvantages of the different types of buses must be taken into account and transforming Singapore's transport system into a 1st world system really depends on deploying the right types of buses at the right places (Bendies for Feeders, short hauls and DDs for Trunks, Express and Long Hauls). A 1-size-fits-it-all approach cannot solve singapore's problems because different buses have different needs and loading patterns.</span></p>

              <p>We will know by 2016 if this is put into action.</p>
              <p>The simplest solution is for the fleet transfer to take place during the conversion to contracting. Areas currently served by articulated buses can give away most of their articulated buses in return for double-deck buses.</p>
              <p>Many of the foreign operators have extensive experience in operating articulated buses, and would have factored this into their proposals. As for the WAB-quota issue, I expect the older articulated buses to be operated only during peak hours, as per the current practice in Perth.</p>
              <p>I agree that most of the legacy fleet (i.e. non-WAB) will be cleaned up by 2020. London has managed to pull that off, Singapore will do this better.</p>

              <p>hahaha given that SMRT is refurbishing their Habits and Volgrens, I doubt they will be gone by 2016. If I am not wrong the 1st Habits are scheduled to end their 17year lifespan in Mid 2017, so with the refurbishments I really would think SMRT will use these buses up to their full lifespans without extensions.</p>
              <p>As for the MK2s, its hard to say. These buses were refurbished together with the MK1s. Once all the MK1s are gone and the A24s have arrived, SMRT might start to deregister the MK2s to make way for more articulated buses (that is, if they order more - because I think LTA would not allow SMRT to add more articulated buses to their fleet without removing some of the existing ones)</p>

              <p>Good that the A24s have finally started to come in. Hopefully SMRT will use them wisely. Since they are highly likely to go into AMDEP, I hope they are used on Yishun Feeders like 800, 804, 806, 811, 812 first. I guess the 40 A24s together with the existing pool of O405G can make these services become WAB and also revert back to a almost all bendy fleet. I believe there will also be some units being deployed to woodlands feeder services because it will not make sense to use the balance A24s on trunks controlled by AMDEP, especially when SMRT has clearly stated bendies for feeders/short trunks and DDs for middle to long distance trunks.</p>
              <p>However, I guess there are still bound to be some SDs around because of those MAN A22s added under BSEP. Hopefully, LTA will also register some BSEP A24s and replace the MAN A22 BSEP slots. And if they do, they can also add A24s to 860.</p>
              <p>Since SMRT has already purchased and taken delivery of the A24s, I dont see a point for LTA to play hardball and not accept bendies to be part of BSEP. If they wanted to do away with bendies, they should have rejected SMRT's purchase in the first place. IMO, i rather let SMRT win Bulim than SBST because atleast then, you could see bendies being operated on Feeders. And maybe it would be a wake up call for SBST to give up its one-size-fits-it-all mentality</p>
