              <p>should swap 851 and 980 around. 980 cannot get DD due to Lor 1 Bus Terminal, while 851 needs some Rigids to DD upgrade. 169 could be AMDEP/WLBP instead of just WLDEP/WLBP.</p>

              <p>But that's the case with so many SMRT services. Had they been with SBST, for sure you would have had a lot of DDs plying all these services.</p>
              <p>High loading route like 851 constantly downgraded and has only 7 HC buses.</p>
              <p>187 only 4. 172 should have 4 but on many days only 2. 189 needs more. 854 needs more. 167/980 each should have got some DDs at least. Most of feeders/intra-towns should be like sv 334 - full fleet bendy. 857/985 so full and such long distance, but 857 only got DD now. 985 god only knows when. 945 feeder always packed to door to MRT in AM. Yet no bendies. 941 also would do good with bendies but only rigids ply. Many times people cannot board first bus and have to wait for bus behind. The list is never ending. </p>

              <p>Actually SBST also only got mass upgradings to DDs in the recent years, when they mass purchased the WEGs. Even 3 years ago, alot of of SBST feeders and those trunks (eg. 101, 130, 139) didnt have so many DDs.  SMRT was lagging behind cos they no DDs and LTA had probably capped the number of bendys on the roads. But now they buy DDs liao, Im sure it will improve but there is transition time, which is now. SMRT already has more high cap buses now and services like 965, 966, 857, which had no high cap buses have DDs now. Also services like 67, 960, 963, 188, 190 have improved drastically in recent days. Just be patient.</p>
              <p>For 985, Im guessing this route is not DD-friendly. So can use bendy lor. The route is definitely bendy friendly cos bendy has cameo-ed before. 941 and 945 I hope will get bendys when SMRT has sufficient units to deploy</p>

              <p>I used to park a 12m single decker at one area where the low hanging branches is just slightly above the roof top which i know DDs cant pass the parking areas..Not much an issue if NEA just prune all the low lying branches near the ONP areas..Of course the normal bus park and the bus stop area is passable to DDs</p>

              <p>Based on what carbikebus said, I think problem is with the section within the carpark. I don't think they would put a double decker even on 980 because based on observation, the buses use that route through the carpark back to their depots.</p>
              <p>When 70 terminated at Geylang, Geylang Lor 1 was still one directional. You could travel straight from Geylang Lor 1 southbound to Mountbatten Rd, but you can't do so in the other direction. This was the reason why 21, 26 and 149 (this section became part of 31) u-turned at Kallang Rd after the terminal. I would expect that 11 and 70 had done the same, meaning, followed the current 980 route out, then u-turned, then turned right from Sims Ave to Geylang Lor 1 and went straight to Mountbatten Rd. The u-turn along Kallang Rd was wide enough that Superbuses used them.</p>
              <p>I don't think any buses exited through the exit which 11, 175, 853, 961 and 985 currently use, maybe except the SSB buses leaving the depot. Anyway that turn tooks tight for a bus to a turn out to Mountbatten Rd, its a very tight u-turn, with high volumes of traffic. The SSB buses could use that exit as they were parked at the northern part of the plot of land, instead of the carpark which 11, 175, 853, 961 and 985 currently use, which is the southern part of the plot of land.</p>
