              <p>That's not correct.  All the NG 363s have the D 2066 LUH 33 engine, which has a peak power output of 265 kW @ 1900 rpm and peak torque output of 1800 Nm @ 1000-1400 rpm.  Both the NL 323 and NG 363 can be fitted with either the ZF EcoLife 6 AP 2000 B with TopoDyn (series production) or Voith D864.5 (optional) gearboxes.</p>

              <p>The listing for the D2066 LUH engines can be found here:</p>

              <p>A D2066 LUH-32 is always rated at 320 hp while the D2066 LUH-33 is 360 hp. The reason why someone changed it on the wiki to 320 hp is because that person took it from the official SMRT source, which is wrong (on their print media during the carnival including the hangers, bookmarks and magazine all listed it as D2066 LUH-32, which is wrong as SMB388S is already registered as a NG363F and not NG323F).</p>
              <p>Do note that SMRT also made other mistakes on the specs of their buses on their print media, such as the O405Gs were all listed to have the OM447hA engine instead of OM447hLA.</p>

              <p>Not likely.  Demonstrators are built to as high spec as possible to give operators a good impression.  The D 2066 LUH 33 engine is the series production engine for the A24 chassis and has been so for about 5 years now.</p>

              <p>Yes, but they can also modify the engine to be different from production... Not always they are high-specs as it seems...</p>
              <p>If high, it impress ops, but easily show off disadvantages, that's why they will prepare demos with trial engine that meets the average criteria between max &amp; low bef giving the actual one if they order... They wouldn't want it to be too outstanding or too impressive, that will end up a disappointment...</p>
              <p>SMB388S for me, it seems slow, but it's atleast just nice and smooth as compared to A22 which is too impressive that now there are many complains coming up...</p>
              <p>I believe if the ops have the confidence of buying production batch even though they just wanted the demo, they might have the choice to get a slightly better trial engine for specific model...</p>

              <p>A D2066 LUH-32 is always rated at 320 hp while the D2066 LUH-33
              is 360 hp. The reason why someone changed it on the wiki to 320 hp
              is because that person took it from the official SMRT source, which
              is wrong (on their print media during the carnival including the
              hangers, bookmarks and magazine all listed it as D2066 LUH-32,
              which is wrong as SMB388S is already registered as a NG363F and not
              NG323F).</p>
              <p>Do note that SMRT also made other mistakes on the specs of their
              buses on their print media, such as the O405Gs were all listed to
              have the OM447hA engine instead of OM447hLA.</p>

              <p>Yes, but they can also modify the engine to be different from
              production... Not always they are high-specs as it seems...</p>
              <p>If high, it impress ops, but easily show off disadvantages,
              that's why they will prepare demos with trial engine that meets the
              average criteria between max &amp; low bef giving the actual one if
              they order... They wouldn't want it to be too outstanding or too
              impressive, that will end up a disappointment...</p>
              <p>SMB388S for me, it seems slow, but it's atleast just nice and
              smooth as compared to A22 which is too impressive that now there
              are many complains coming up...</p>
              <p>I believe if the ops have the confidence of buying production
              batch even though they just wanted the demo, they might have the
              choice to get a slightly better trial engine for specific
              model...</p>

              <p>A22 is a bit too fast for our roads,you go off before elderly had taken their seats sure bound to have complains..As for me i dont mind high capacity buses have high output given the weight stress theyre carrying or pulling..</p>

              <p>I have a feeling wont be 100% of MAN A24 go to AMDEP and Yishun though it might get a majority. SMRT will probably ration out the A24s to as many feeders as possible so that more services can go WAB. With most of their competitor (SBST) feeders being WAB, there definitely is immense pressure on them to follow suit ASAP too. Hope they place the orders for more A24s soon but i guess they will be only just in time to replace the MKIIs and Batch I Habits when they start to retire</p>
              <p>Highly likely SMRT will deploy A24s and A22s to make up the 55% fleet requirement for WAB and then deploy SDs and Bendys in a 70:30 ratio. So AMDEP, WLDEP and KJDEP will all get a share of the A24s. Bt Panjang/Bt Batok Feeders will probably not get any.</p>
              <p>And wah... why 190 again? I thot 190 already conversion towards full DD, what for try out new bendy on it!</p>
