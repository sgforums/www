              <p>If concept bus is going to be 3 door DD 12.8m just for feeder services, I will not support the idea.

The bendys are definitely more flexible than 12m DDs and 12.8m DDs are just going to be worse. Second, people's mindset is something you cant change. If you put DD on feeders, people will just fill lower decks first and then the rest will start standing and play the waiting game for someone else to go up.

              <p>Third, 3 door bendy is quite defined where rear 2 doors are for alighting only. but in 3 door DD, people who actually go up may use either of the 2 staircases and alighting wise is going to be same too.

For feeders with high passenger activity, 3 door DD will hence not solve the problem of high dwell times at busstops.</p>
              <p>Whats the issue with bendy for feeders? They mostly ply non congested roads that have 1-3 services only at 70-80% of route. Also if parking area is the problem, depots can be multi-storied to utilise land area better.

              <p>Conclusion: If want to use DDs, bus route structures got to change. If you want adopt london/HK way of DD/SD only, routes have to be changed too. Bus routes should not be catered to bring passengers to MRT stations mostly but instead serve as comeptitive and good alternatives for non-transfer direct travel. Then DDs will work better. </p>

              <p>I wrote about this at length previously. One way is to change the layover point of the articulated buses to be at the looping point, or have split bus stops as per Bukit Panjang MRT/LRT Station's current arrangements.</p>
              <p>However, I suspect neither option will be popular with commuters.</p>
              <p>The third door and third staircase are designed around passenger's mentality. If they bothered to move to the rear or upper deck more (especially for feeder routes), this would not have been necessary in the first place.</p>

              <p>If you worry about passenger flow, you can refer to the structure of the trams in HK. </p>
              <p>Generally it's quite straightforward. Passengers will only go in one direction. Thats because there isnt an incentive to go in the other. The set of stairs and doors (adjacent to each other) for entry is located at one end. The other set for exit at the other. </p>
              <p>In Singapore, passengers who have to exit have to go against the tide from the seats at the back to the exit door in the middle. Essentially the structure in SG is [entrance] - [exit] - [seats], which can prove catastrophic. Made worse with DDs, as they have an additional upper deck to be taken care of by a single narrow stairway.</p>
              <p>But in the mentioned concept varient, the structure is [entrance] - [seats] - [exit], which meant passengers will be spread even throughout — using the very own minsets of these passengers.</p>
              <p>As for the middle door the solution is ridiculously simple — just make it an exit door like a bendy! Just program the ez link card readers to make it such. But I do feel, only the rear door should be made exit-only, as the middle door, having no stairs connected to it, serves as a useful entry/exit door for lower deck without having to share with upper deck. </p>
              <p>I think it is absurd you will denounce three-door-dual-stair for 12m DD; 12m DD should just never show up in feeders and intratowns lah. It just ill performs in all aspects.</p>

              just deploy 12m DD and hope for the best.<br> <br> First of all feeder services need buses that can maneuvre through
              narrower roads. The bendys are definitely more flexible than 12m
              DDs and 12.8m DDs are just going to be worse. Second, people's
              mindset is something you cant change. If you put DD on feeders,
              people will just fill lower decks first and then the rest will
              start standing and play the waiting game for someone else to go up.
              End up upper deck will be not even half full. 12.8m 3 Door DD is
              going to make it worse because lower deck floor areas will be
              smaller than 12m DD. SO if no bendy, still 12m DD better.</p>
              <p>Third, 3 door bendy is quite defined where rear 2 doors are for
              alighting only. but in 3 door DD, people who actually go up may use
              either of the 2 staircases and alighting wise is going to be same
              too. Hence passenger flow, even with 3 doors is going to be messy
              and not going to be good like a bendy. For feeders with high
              passenger activity, 3 door DD will hence not solve the problem of
              high dwell times at busstops.</p>
              <p>Whats the issue with bendy for feeders? They mostly ply non
              congested roads that have 1-3 services only at 70-80% of route.
              Also if parking area is the problem, depots can be multi-storied to
              utilise land area better. For interchanges, can just minimise lay
              over time in interchange by adopting jump bus or even operate
              routes directly from depots.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: If want to use DDs, bus route structures got to
              change. If you want adopt london/HK way of DD/SD only, routes have
              to be changed too. Bus routes should not be catered to bring
              passengers to MRT stations mostly but instead serve as comeptitive
              and good alternatives for non-transfer direct travel. Then DDs will
              work better. </p>

              <p>Your post sort of explains why there are flame wars in this forum. People adovcating for more single deckers, others complaining that there are too much. Some like DDs, can't stand a single bendy, while others (like me) like bendies but are ok with DDs so long as numbers of DDs and bendies are at an efficient levels. Some want this, some want that. Of course there will be flame wars.</p>

              <p>Ok to your post proper, regarding narrow roads, if you been to the narrow roads in Tampines St 2x/3x where 291 serves, and where during peak hours it is quite difficult for traffic behind the buses to overtake due to traffic on the opposite direction, the deployment of bendy buses would shorten the dwell times at the bus stop, reducing the waiting times for other vehicles waiting behind, and therefore improving the traffic flow. Because when it comes to narrow roads with lesser opportunity to pass, the length of vehicle doesn't matter as much as the dwell time when it comes to improving traffic flow.</p>
              <p>It is not outdated to have pro bendy views, in fact a lot more countries in the world have bendy buses for transit applications than double deckers even though a lot of them had tried double deckers before. And most BRT systems use bendy buses over double deckers because they need the efficiency of a bendy bus; it is the closest a bus can match in terms of dwell times to a train. It is in fact, for a lot of cities, the future of transport.</p>
              <p>Also, LTA may add buses, but how many buses is enough? Till there is a labour shortage (which there already is)? Till the roads are full of buses, with buses causing jams (see HK)?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Agreed,With our commuting attitude 12m DDs isnt really up to the job for feeders or super short distance trunk,LTA should introduce under 12.8m 3 doors/dual staircase and make public annoucement to encourage people that the new DDs is better than current buses.</p></div>

              Haha, that last part...
              Or can the last staircase be used for alighting only? And the first to be boarding?

              <p>Just stick to bendy or SD for feeders/intra-town...</p>
              <p>It's difficult to change the habit...take a look at the trials of the MRT queue at various MRT platforms..when it comes to peak hours, everything haywire. </p>
              <p>Ideal layout would be...<br>- SBS Transit's Citaro ~ Wide standing space opposite doors, since more passengers love to crowd around there(the door). </p>
              <p>- HK Buses ~ Wheelchair bay next to the door, boarding passengers have more space to "cut" and head for the rear. </p>
              <p>- Dual Stairs, BUT side by side. Maybe that could change the direction of flow easily, rather than asking ppl to go all the way behind to alight. </p>
