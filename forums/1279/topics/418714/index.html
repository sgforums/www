              <p>To think of it, SMRT SL never scared of side swipe accident. Ever saw 1 alomst occured at Bt Batok, oil acclerator thinking can be faster than car <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Jurong Pt is made worst w/ all the loading/ unloading vehicle taking up 1 lane.</p>

              <p>Even if there are no cars, all the bendies just jam up the whole drive way. Especially 3 bendies from the first alighting berth onwards, the next bus turning right into the interchange have to wait for the next green arrow to turn in.</p>
              <p>Worse still during peak hours, sometimes the bus stop outside the row of shop houses behind the interchange, at least 2 bendies, normally 804 and 806 and sometimes a single deck would just block the exit from the bus interchange for services 39, 85, 852 ,853, 855.</p>
              <p>LTA should just ban bendies. They are taking too much space on the roads, especially in small bus stops and busy roads and bus interchanges. SMRT should just buy double deckers to ease their workload. And don't ever say that SMRT cannot buy double deckers because there is no law here that says that only SBST can buy double deckers exclusively.</p>

              <p>It really depends the types of engines that they can choose for a double decker bus. Double deckers are also powerful too, like those in Hong Kong. Anyway, how fast do they want? Singapore buses are generally limited to 70km/h.</p>

              <p>There aren't many bus routes now with height limits. Even if with height limits, most of the routes are using single deckers and better frequencies. Like 95, 173.</p>
              <p>Moreover you have to take into account that the future design of bus interchanges and terminals are getting smaller and smaller, how to accomodate more bendies in future? You want to have queues of buses jamming inside and outside the bus interchanges? Look at SMRT depots, they are already so squeezed with bendies. Unless they are building bigger depots, then what is the point?</p>
              <p>Just look at the interchanges, only Sembawang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok seems to be in a better situations without much bendy buses. Places like Woodlands, Yishun are always badly jammed because of bendy buses. Chua Chu Kang is still not that bad.</p>

              <p>just face the fact, SMRT will not be having any more bendies in future. They can do all sorts of redeployments for now, incld sv806, but down the road, the bendies will have to go. even 1105H they also desperate to revive it despite all odds.<br><br>woodlands is a high density estate with terrible transport links. Trunk services takes only 3 routes out of the estate. 85% of the flats are only served by pathetic feeders, tts why u see the interchange so crowded. everyone has to pass by Woodlands/Marsiling/Admiralty. cannot escape one.</p>

              <p>yes and no. Even as a driver, as a passenger or as a pedestrian I will never regret they being removed. long vehicles pose more risks to everyone.<br>True, they make alightings faster, but at what expense? if u ask me, u ask PAP u ask hongkong u ask those congested cities, they tell you double decks is the way to go. space is precious in singapore.<br><br>crowd problem also becos too few buses serving too much population. <br><br>anyway, dont go off topic..</p>

              <p>It really depends the types of engines that they can choose for a double decker bus. Double deckers are also powerful too, like those in Hong Kong. Anyway, how fast do they want? Singapore buses are generally limited to 70km/h.</p>
              <p><br>If you can't take criticisms and other opinions, then don't surf a forum. This is an open discussion area, not for you to discuss about issues that suit to your ears only.</p>
              <p>If you think that SMRT can only buy bendies and cannot buy double deckers, then continue with that narrow minded thinking.</p>
              <p>There aren't many bus routes now with height limits. Even if with height limits, most of the routes are using single deckers and better frequencies. Like 95, 173.</p>
              <p>Moreover you have to take into account that the future design of bus interchanges and terminals are getting smaller and smaller, how to accomodate more bendies in future? You want to have queues of buses jamming inside and outside the bus interchanges? Look at SMRT depots, they are already so squeezed with bendies. Unless they are building bigger depots, then what is the point?</p>
              <p>Just look at the interchanges, only Sembawang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok seems to be in a better situations without much bendy buses. Places like Woodlands, Yishun are always badly jammed because of bendy buses. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chua Chu Kang is still not that bad.</span></strong></p>

              <p>Thing is, it's either ADD or bendy fleet.</p>
              <p>Unless it's saying willing to spend $$ to upgrade bus stops to take in 2x bendies. To think of it, there's issues w/ such design</p>
              <p>1: Peak hr ok because of human volume. Off peak how? SL think bo lang, overtake? But ppl cannot see the bus, it's too far. To think of it, by the time e front bus moves off, ppl start to walk up to the 2nd bus, wouldn't there be backlog?</p>
              <p>If the 3rd bus is a bendy and overtakes, would ends up seeing tis 2nd bus can't even move off on time. Backlog is another issue. Some bus stops are near traffic junction.</p>
              <p>Then some bus stops like Thong Teck Bldg, they pose a hazard.</p>
              <p>2: Space usage: 1 ADD 131 ppl, 1 bendy 131 ppl.</p>
              <p>3: Maintenance: The articulator no one bothers to maintain. Recently saw those rubber being rubbed off to the road at Boon Lay Way recently. Less the refurb, all are now rubbing to the road at every moment.</p>
