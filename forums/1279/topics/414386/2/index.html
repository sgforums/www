              <p><br>Bendies always jam up the alighting area in Yishun Interchange. A few instances where many bendies jam up the alighting area because one of the BC driving a bendy went down to tap his card. End up a long line of buses behind. In the end, I have to see bus 857 reversing out and I missed my bus, just because the bus I am in got stuck in the queue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>If 169 never went to Tibs it would be majority DD. SBS used to deploy LA on this route, but old WDL Int had height restrictions, IIRC. WOnder how SBS got round this.</p>
              <p>SBW, BPJ and CCK are SMRT owned suburbs without DD. WDL has VSOs on 168, BBT has SBS routes 157 &amp; 174 passing through. BPJ used to have VOs from BBDEP on 190, but that changed in 1999.</p>

              <p>There are many rumors that the bendy bus is already banned. Even fromÂ a friendÂ who knew people in LTA and SMRT. Well, I'm afraid it is likely to be true. Even not, someone here have stated earlier that it will be limited to a certain quota, so we will see lesser of bendy buses in future.</p>
              <p>I don't agree with you on the different trademark models forÂ differentÂ bus company that they should be forced upon to be used and this shouldn't be the norm of Singapore culture. If a type of bus model is proved to be more cost and operative effective to operate, why not all bus companies use the same type of buses to improve bus operations instead??? Why SMRT can't buy double deckers where SBST can use them and proved to be more suitable for our road conditions, in this congested and crowded city??? I saw discussions in some earlier threads here, well, if SBST can buy double deckers, why can't SMRT buy and have to forced to use bendy buses which gives them many problems, especially parking spaces???</p>
              <p>Just like what it is in Hong Kong, regardless of KMB, CityBus, etc, they all use double deckers, highly efficient for heavy workloads, do not cause jams and long bus queues and yet being more flexible than the MTR.</p>
              <p>I still prefer double deckers over bendies in our heavy utilised and narrow roads, just like the road conditions in Hong Kong. The main reasons that LTA bans bendy buses is that they take up too much road space on our roads and bus bays, especially those small bus stops. LTA is not in favor in long bus queues, which apparently was a big problem for bus operations in the 1970s. Not only it causes long bus queues but also longer waiting times for other commuters who wanted to take the bus that may be long behind the queue. And it is really time exsperating for them, especially if they see a long long empty bus/buses waiting in the queue, while jamming the bus behind that they want to take.</p>
              <p>Moreover they can jam up roads and cause inconvenience to other road users, especially small slip roads, which they can block the whole pedestrain crossing for pedestrain, or to other drivers like blocking lanes of road when trying to make a right turn or overtake, etc, causing jams behind. Imagine you are driving and a long almost empty bendy bus block your way, it can be very frustrating. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Secondly they are very accident and fire prone in Singapore. They have the highest accident/fire rates, followed by single deckers, and surprisingly lastlyÂ are double deckers. Accidents includes those minor ones that are not published in the press. Even in London, they are very fire prone. Just look at our weather and our stressed operative conditions, I think the Citaro Gs are going to have a very hard time surviving here. Either it is frequent breakdowns, or burnt Citaro Gs every month, won't it be a big waste to see these buses burnt where instead they can survive longer in other temperate countries. Look at the burnt buses rate for the past few years, really heart breaking to see them burnt up just like that. And look at the bus company operating point of view, if the certain bus model is prone to fire, why does it want to buy it and disrupt its operations now and then and have to spend extra money to fix them up or buy replacements???</p>
              <p>Lastly, Singapore public transport is moving towards a hub and spoke concept. Thus we may see more shorter haul new services and moving towards higher frequncies for bus services. Well, I do hope they will keep all those long haul services, but definately they are going to improve the frequncies in future, based on the lastest QOS standards. If this is so, why still have to buy more bendy buses to load in more people, (and it is not favoring for Singapore roads and operations), where double deckers can do the same job, without taking up more road space and take up more area in a bus interchange and depot??? Moreover, the bendy bus only takes in around 10 more people than an aircon double decker, but takes up almost twice more the road space as the latter. Looking into providing better frequencies, the passenger load up rate will be much lesser than what it is now, so wouldn't it be a waste for the bus operations and road space if the passenger load up rate is not going to fill up the bendy bus all the time???</p>
              <p>Do also keep in mind that the size of the bus depots of SMRT are limited, so having too much bendy buses is a big headache for them now. Right now, they are waiting for the west DTL to be finished asap, so that they can withdraw and integrate some bus services in the Northwest, and free up some buses to improve on other services and at the same time resolve the space crunch in the 3 depots all these years. That is also the time that most of the bendy buses have reached their lifespan and withdraw from operations.</p>
              <p>Looking into these factors, won't getting a double decker bus being more cost and operative effective??? Do take note that the new and upcoming bus interchanges are getting smaller in area, why does bus companies still want to buy long bendy buses to jam up the place even further??? And looking into another factor, given more MRT lines in future, even current bus routes are left untouched, there is a high possibility that there will be no or very few new bus services in future, especially when LTA takes over the central planning. What is more worrying is that we might even see lesser double deckers in future, which I am strongly against.</p>
              <p>However if LTA is only limiting the numbers, well, hope SBST can buy a few bendy buses for some short haul services for our lazy and pampered Singaporeans. I missed the Volvo B10MA bendy bus in the late 1990s. And I also missed that era that SBS had the widest range of buses, from midi-buses like the Darts, to single deckers, to double deckers, air con and non air con, to 14.5m superlong bus, to 19m bendy buses. Won't it be nice if SBST have a small fleet of, say 100, Citaro Gs or B9LAs again??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>The problem with DDs would be the need for high clearance. Also, some corners are not suitable for high vehicles due to centre of gravity issues.</p>
              <p>As much as I would like to see the B9TL in Transperth livery, I know that is impossible due to the above reasons. Perth has enough space, however, compared to SG and HK. The other two locations are too crowded to have too many long vehicles.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think SMRT just buy many 12m single decker buses will do as you all can see that another 3-5 more years circle line and MRT down town line is fully operational by SMRT. So those 12m buses can use for feeder bus service for MRT service. forget about bendy bus or double decker bus for SMRT. I think many bus services will be reduce or rerouteÂ as most of the key route is covered by MRT by then. So no point buying many DD or Bendy buses waste resources. As for CNG bus you will expect the bus will move very slow because CNG hasÂ no power to drive it. I am driving a CNG taxi I know when you fully load up the car it has no power to go up ECP. And you don't ask SMRT CNG busesÂ to travel to out of the way 5 CNG station to top everyday. another thing it too dangerous to have it look at those PTE CNG buses get ban on the road after one catches fire.</p></div>

              <p><br>thing is, MRT will never replace e entire trunk bus sv network, it's a costly game to do so.</p>
              <p>in any case e purpose of MRT is to serve e mass corridor fast tat's all. dedicated areas rather leave it to e buses as well</p>
