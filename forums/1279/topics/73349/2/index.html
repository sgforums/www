I do not noe how long it is on 851, whether a few hours or one day. But I boarded the bus. I am very pleased in fact, and even after i got home, i was telling another fren of mine, a bus fan, about this. sometimes 851 gets 1201 too. But nv b4 1234T. I was extremely pleased and even thought that 1234T was the last bus in the habit series, but it turned out that 1247 was the last. I am sure as daylight. Anyway, i could not have confused the rego. There are a few examples:<br><br>TIB1324 (not possible)<br>TIB1243 (oso not possible)<br>TIB1423 (DEFINITELY NOT)<br><br>so whats left is 1234.</div>
