              <p>Nope. Their de-registration date is about less than 10 months starting from now, Especially the 447C-466Y batch.</p>
              <p>And speaking about OCs, 171 should start getting full day OC cameos from WLDEP on a frequent basis as of now. Pretty much irrelevant but I feel it's time.</p>

              <p>No, I've never meant that way, but it can't stay this way forever. Citaros from WLDEP I haven't seen one yet, WLDEP OCs are already quite hard to see on 171, I'm not sure who did full day before given WLDEP's starter are quite slow I feel most probably they will start off with OCs before moving on to citaros.</p>
              <p>The OCs that WLDEP has from the depot transfer last time out is enough to give WLDEP 171 for full day OC cameos, Or you still want more?</p>

              <p>No, I've never meant that way, but it can't stay this way

              they will start off with OCs before moving on to citaros.</p>
              <p>The OCs that WLDEP has from the depot transfer last time out is

              <p>950 isn't a certified WAB service yet, so I would prefer the volgrens to do the job and let 171 have the OCs, and not forgetting the new buses coming in, and old buses coming out.</p>
              <p>It is not that I keep knocking hard that 171 should get OC cameos from WLDEP. But considering the 0405's lifespan aren't getting younger by day especially TIB496K and 497H less than a year left, 577K about 13 months and the rest having 15 months left, I feel it is time. </p>
              <p>Extension whether or not we will see, I don't wish to speculate.</p>
