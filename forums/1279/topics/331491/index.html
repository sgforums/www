              <p><br>Sincerely, some of them drive quite fast and quite fierce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The local drivers, especially some malays would take things easy and play safe. From my rides on Sv 980, i would always see a female chinese BC driving everytime i go to the Victoria Street Library every monday. She drives quite ok and she have the tendency of horning her bus horn at people at the bus stop to alert them whether they want to flag for her bus or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Luckily it was a Dennis Lance, a bus that has a funny, but soft horn. Wonder if it were to be her driving a KUB, a bus famous for it's 'bull horn'. :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For SMRT China BCs, i realised that there is a trend where they would never put up their rear destos but put the rear desto on the windscreen. This happens, especially for WLDEP ones. Good example is Sv 178 where almost half of the day's fleet do not have their rear destos shown at the rear of the bus, especially UDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recruiting chinese BCs all have their pros and cons though.</p>

              <p>the 178 and 852 SLs know that they are driving UD with such tiny EDS which could hardly be seen by most people from far. putting the rear desto at the windscreen allows people to see a little more easier...</p>

              <p>some bus can be late by as much as 20 mins depending on the traffic conditions. there are relatively emptier stretches of roads, but when the bus is alr running late,  it is kinda of pointless to insist at continue running at 60km/h</p>

              <p>of cuz when the BCs/SLs are late, they tend to drive faster to catch up with the timings as stated on their timesheets, however, some buses are limited to 60km/h due to the active speed limiter.</p>
