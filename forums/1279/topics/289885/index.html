Actually I am just curious whether like for example 169, who plans out this route first? Is it SBS or TIBS in the past?<br><br>I always thought that the 85x are the pioneer services that TIBS has introduced and thus the bus territory thing is ignored for these services. TIBS has always been known to use 85x service numbers. However, after checking with Sgwiki, I realise that 167 is the first ever TIBS service.<br><br>Just a thought.</div>
