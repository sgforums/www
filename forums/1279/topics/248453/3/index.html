            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah, the svc 361 accident was at the front of the interchange, just a stone's throw away you can cross the road at the traffic light.<br>Hmm, there was once when an off service bus knocked down a man at the entrance of the interchange, believe it was 597C due the maintanance marks on the front driver side. Why suspect 597C? The bus has ever been the best choice for Bukit Batok speeding drivers even since the accident and is perm on svc 189 till now. Usually the accident vehicle gets the credit in this weird part of SG. Just my opinions.<br>Although I stay in the area and jaywalk many times (except for accident area), never been ever alert than after the accident.</div>

Then if one day you are driving then someone suddenly dash across the road &amp; u cant brake on time &amp; knock him/hert down , it ur fault meh?
