            <div class='col-md body'>For JC students who have just graduated (studying from 2002-2003) like me, the student concession card is programmed to become an adult EZ-Link card with effect from 1 Jan 2004. Transitlink says there are no more concessions because we are no longer students but I think it's still pretty unfair on us since we pay student fares at 11.59pm on 31 Dec 2003 and then when the clock striked 12am on 1 Jan 2004, we're suddenly paying adult fares. I mean when the student farecard was still being used, I'm sure we would still be allowed to use it as it is. For heavy travellers like me, the bus fares are taking a heavy toll on my wallet and I'm not working, so even if I want to buy concession (which I have always been buying all along), I'm not entitled to do so since I would have to be an SBS Transit or TIBS shareholder. That effectively rules us out of having the adult concession and it's strange that university students and NSMen can buy concession while we effectively don't have any concession to buy to offset high travel costs. I just hope SBS Transit can do something about this...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did you take the "A" Levels at the end of 2003? If so, what did they do? Give you student concession rates? Anyway, according to this <a href="http://www.transitlink.com.sg/news.php?menu=news_menu.html&amp;no=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.transitlink.com.sg/news.php?menu=news_menu.html&amp;no=1</a>, only Pri 6 repeat students and Secondary 4 and 5 students who took their GCE 'O' Level examination in Year 2003 get to extend their concession but not JC2 students who took their GCE "A" Level examination in Year 2003.<br><br>Anyway, here's their response to my enquiry in November (I enquired through their website), which is utter crap:<br><br>We refer to your feedback to EZ-Link Pte Ltd on the above-mentioned<br>subject.  The matter was subsequently forwarded to TransitLink as the<br>administration of the Student Concession Card and monthly concession<br>passes come under our purview.<br><br>Please allow us to introduce ourselves.  TransitLink is a service<br>company set up by Singapore's three major public transport operators<br>- SBS Transit Ltd (SBS Transit), Singapore MRT Ltd (SMRT) and<br>Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd (Tibs) to provide an integrated public<br>transport system by bringing the MRT, LRT and buses together as one<br>single, comprehensive network.	We have also been appointed by<br>EZ-Link Pte Ltd, the Ez-link Card Manager, as the managing agent for<br>sale, revaluation, replacement and refund of the ez-link Card.<br><br>We would like to share with you that upon graduation or withdrawal<br>from school, the concession eligibility of the Student Concession<br>Card will expire.  Thereafter, students have a grace period of 6<br>months to continue the use of the Student Concession Card after the<br>end of their course duration.  During this grace period, students<br>cannot purchase monthly concessions passes since they are no longer<br>students but they are able to top up their card and use it like an<br>Adult ez-link Card.  This also gives the card holder time to arrange<br>to refund their card's remaining value at any TransitLink Ticket<br>Office before the card becomes invalid.<br><br>Students may check the expiry date of their ez-link Card at any Add<br>Value Machine (AVM) or General Ticketing Machine (GTM).<br><br>If your concession eligibility is expiring soon, you can still<br>purchase a monthly concession pass.  The unused portion of the<br>monthly concession pass will be refunded to you on a pro-rated basis.<br><br>Thereafter, you can purchase an Adult ez-link Card from the Ticket<br>Office for $15 ($7 Stored Value, $3 Refundable Travel Deposit and $5<br>Non-refundable Card Cost).<br><br>To help commuters in the transition from the magnetic fare card to<br>the ez-link card over the last 19 months, EZ-Link has given all<br>commuters the opportunity to have their first adult ez-link card at<br>no cost.  For subsequent cards purchased, a fully refundable card fee<br>of $2 for adult ez-link cards was imposed.  Hence, these cards are<br>essentially issued for use at no cost.	For eligible students, they<br>have the opportunity to enjoy concession fares through their<br>concession cards.<br><br>EZ-Link has considered different alternatives to stem the wastage of<br>cards before implementing the new card policy.	With over 5.3 million<br>cards in circulation and almost, if not all commuters already have a<br>card, there is no longer the need for EZ-Link to continue subsidising<br>the cards.  The new card policy is the most equitable as it means<br>that only those who require additional cards pay for them.<br><br>We would also like to share that with the new card policy, commuters<br>will still get their faulty or damaged ez-link cards replaced at no<br>cost, if the fault or damage is incurred through normal usage.<br><br>We hope that our reply has helped clarify the situation and we<br>appreciate your gracious understanding on the matter.  For more<br>information on Student Concession Card, please visit our website at<br>www.transitlink.com.sg.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Yours sincerely<br></div>

Cos I thought the extension of concession validity was only for the J1s. Anyway, there's a way to underpay and I will say it's not exactly illegal, more like exploiting a loophole in the system. I've done this on 4 rides already... Just show your EZ-Link student pass and pay $0.45 in coins for non-aircon bus ride and $0.55 for air-con bus ride. I think even if the inspector checks, just show your ticket and student pass and things should be okay.</div>

But there's also an alternative - tap at the front and back doors straightaway after boarding. One loophole on the cash system is that there is no transfer rebate. By using the alternative i mentioned earlier, you can enjoy transfer rebates of $0.25. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I know... You have to calculate it out 1st... The cash method best works when you're taking a single bus direct to your destination. For the tap twice on the card reader, some guai lan bus drivers might spot it and ask u to retap on the entrance readers again... And if inspector comes up the bus, you have to devise ways to dodge it. And if the Vehicle Location System is enabled, then you will not be able to tap it on the exit reader until the exit doors are open again at the next stop. This will not work when for example, you take 23 outside Siemens building and the bus travels by the expressway to Bedok Reservoir Rd. You'll end up paying more than 63 cents in this case.</div>

By doing so, is this like cheating in a way (e.g. lying that you are J2 repeat student)? And what if Transitlink checks up with the school? Lastly, what do you mean by "the card is unset"?</div>
