I think what u said in the last sentence is abit off of what u asked (topic) . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway , race arh ? Ytd took SBS7465Y on 143 . Our bus was ahead first . Near harbourfront , one VO3x overtook us , because we are waiting to pick up passengers . Then both bus met at a bus stop . We took off together and stopped at the same time at a traffic light , side by side , i guess the BC were talking to each other using sign language . Then when the traffic light turns green , we immediately took off in an instant , leaving the VO3x behind .<br><br>But never under estimate the VO3x ! Our bus stopped at a busstop to pick up people as we are infront . Then the VO3x just zoom past at quite a high speed , much to my amazement . Then at West Coast road there, we raced again . At the roundabout , our bus was kinda turning at medium speed , so it was quite bumpy . Then when we reached the straight road (literally all lights were green , so we are able chiong) . Saw the VO3x infront of us , but our bus just powers away ! Can hear the B9TL engine's turbo , very loud . Overtook the VO3x . From then on , at Teban Garderns there , no more overtaking .<br><br>Nice "race" . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
