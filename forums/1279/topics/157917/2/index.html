I do not see his comments as wild accussations. He had stated facts. The number of services SMRT had introduced over the years.<br><br>Many residents from BP had written to press regarding inadequate bus services provided in their area. How's about YT?<br><br>Why adding more svs does not mean better? Won't you be happy to have another new service serving you to town? A new service may cutdown your transfer time, save your transportation fees, enhanced your assets too. <strong>Would you ask SBST to remove any of the existing bus services currently plying into your estates?</strong><br><br>If I were to compare both SMRT 'display thingy' and SBST 'bus timetables', I will give SMRT initiative as 2/10 and SBST as 8/10.

Both are train/bus operators. As an outsider, I see SMRT reluctant in introducing more bus services as it afraid that it might eat into its train revenues.<br><br>Perhaps PTC should review SMRT justification in raising its bus fare next June, if SMRT fails to invest more on its bus operations.

            <div class='col-md body'>giving SBST 8/10 for the initiative to put down route timetables for svc 200 is a bit weird considering that they HAVE to do it especially since they increased the frequency offpeak from 20+ mins to 33 mins.<br><br>you really think the route timetables by SBST are accurate most of the time? Case in point, SBST Express 518. Go wait at any bus stop in Pasir Ris and Tampines during offpeak hours. The bus never arrives on time or worse, never even arrives at all!</div>
