              <p><br> I DID NOT COMPLAIN NO WRIGHTS</p>
              <p>For new buses on 163, I only care abt SD replacement, NOT DD
                          REPLACEMENT. I am very content that a VO is actually running on
                          163. LEAVE ALONE EVEN A TRIDENT. A Wright? I WILL BE SUPER HAPPY.
                          BUT I CAN LIVE WITHOUT WRIGHTS ON 163, unless if 163 started
                          loading in DDs.</p>
              <p>So juz give me ONE SINGLE CITARO CAMEO on 163 and the two
                          goddamned flaming MKIII replaced wif WAB (Citaros are best choice)
                          and i will be VERY pleased wif 163 oredi.</p>

              <p>lemon1974 did not said that it was you who complained eh? He only said someone living in Fernvale in his previous post. Why so readily admit you are not the one? HEH. There could be so many others living in Fernvale. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>Besides, i think your post is kinda contradicting. If you want a single Citaro cameo, you got to make sure you have the time to take it. Who knows, it might be late in the night and as a last-minute breakdown replacement for only 1 trip. If you missed it, then are you going to ask for more Citaros again? You are not the starter in the depot, you don't have the ability to predict when and where is he going to deploy the Citaros yeah. </p>
              <p>And if 163 does get Citaros, then doesn't that cancel out your SINGLE CITARO CAMEO request already? And if 163 does get KUBs as WABs, your Citaro cameo will come sooner or later yeah, although none might be perm? You can only have certain good things, but not all at once. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"><br><br>And if you are a frequent Citaro &amp; KUB passenger (i have Citaros on 53, 109 &amp; 518, and KUBs from 12, 17, 21, 39, 53, 81, 109 &amp; 359 at the nearest bus stop), you would know that the Citaros are not practical at all for alot of services. Yes, they might be new, powerful, but heck, during peak hours, the aisle can only accomdate one row of standing passengers with no space to move in, whereby the KUB can accomodate 2 rows with some space still between passengers. Even as a bus fan here, i'm still pretty neutral towards KUBs &amp; Citaros. Both have their strengths &amp; flaws, and you as a small passenger, just don't have much say in how they deploy their buses. Instead, you should look at your 163 fleet, cherish the better buses you have (i'm sure there are some better ones in the fleet), and make it your pet service instead of criticising it constantly. That's the basic thing that a bus fan should do: Love your pet service(s). And not just become a bus fan plainly to spot cameos or redeployments.</p>
              <p>If you wait patiently, the time for your fleet upgrade will come. On the other hand, by constantly harrassing the SBST people to upgrade your pet service (anyone that is guilty), the starter might instead get pissed and purposely downgrade your service to make it worse for you.</p>
              <p>And to those who keep asking for new buses, there is not much point to it. The buses are not your property, it is only your means to move around. If you want a new bus so much, buy one from Mercedes, park it in your garage/HDB carpark/outside your door or whatever. Then you can stare at it daily, get a chaffeur to drive you around in your new bus, and enjoy the ride. The buses you have now on 163 (or any other service you are unhappy with) are SBST's property, they decide what to do with the bus, where to deploy, when to scrap them, not you.</p>

              <p>I think your comment here needs some improvement. Firstly, you need to refer to the Sgwiki Buses deployment page, ask around others, and not rely on solely your own eyes. </p>
              <p>Service 75 still has at least 4 Mercedes O405s being perm yeah, while majority being Citaros. Not all Citaros in its perm fleet. </p>
              <p>Service 109 still has 8335H 8617U 8620J 8622D 8888D these 5 K230UBs in its perm fleet. Plus a Volvo Mk3 850P as perm too. How can you anyhow whack it and say that "109 all Citaros"? It is evidently not.</p>
              <p>Service 241 has only a certain 7555X as a WRIGHT B9TL. 7470G 7482Y are ComfortDelgro B9TLs. Yes, there might be more Wrights now on 241 nowadays, but as far as anyone knows, the perm fleet is not all Wrights as you claim. Besides, 9334D &amp; 9496U are Volvo Olympians, not a Wright B9TL for goodness sake. So if you are saying the 241 DD fleet is all Wrights, is your statement valid? And there are other perm K230UBs on 241 also.</p>
              <p>Service 60 still has 9262C. And please, there are still 8093E 8095A 8096Y 8097U 8098S 8101R these 6 perm Scania K230UBs. Not all Wrights as you claim as well, even if you are talking about the DD fleet.</p>
              <p>And furthermore, why are you even bringing in Wrights into this discussion? I was talking about K230s &amp; Citaros, and you suddenly bring in Wrights and claim that this service and that "all Citaros" or "all Wrights", which are all proven to be wrong.</p>
              <p>Lastly, your account was only registered in Nov 2011 (which i assume is today) since your only single post so far is in this thread, was in response to a possible flaming post by me (which i have no intention to flame anyone, if you could hold your temper &amp; read each word carefully). <br>So what is the possibility of your account being a clone of someone else here, which i might have actually triggered his self-defence mechanism? I am only guessing, but the possibility is too high even to the others yo. <br>Alas, I joined from Apr 2005, has 400+ valid posts with only 1 account &amp; you with only 1 post so far in this account (which is this thread) and possibly registered only today. (possibly holding other accounts too since you know 75, 109, 60 &amp; 241 so well). So tell me, who is more likely the clone of someone else, and who has more credibility? I am not being egoistic here, i am just stating a plain fact.<br><br>So hold your temper, and don't smash your keyboard if you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
