Dress rims are now offered as option. Thats why you see the B9TL do not have dress rims. Mercs and MAN maybe gort . Scania think so too. Not sure about Volvo tho.<br><br>And i agree, VSO with dress rims looks nicer than those without dress rims, just like someone who tucks in uniform and one who doesn't.

Then why the problems u found out u dun want to write to SBST to complain about it? u only know how to complain here and point out all the mistake but not to write to SBST? If u r saying like that, u think the mechanics and drivers have so much time to sit at the rear sits to test which bus has hot heat? This is ridiculous. U r just making contradict remarks!

Go to an interview in an T-shirt or mismatched combination of clothing, what do your interviewer feel? Same, if slbp had Mercs as nice and clean looking as buses from other depots (maybe except the nicer ones like 450K), motorists, passengers, tourists would feel that the buses have been well kept. This is one reason why many of the members feel that SMRT buses are better (although the opposite is true)  because first impression is newer looking buses with EDS, look more modern. (they hide their UDs somewhere else)</div>

Even tho the rather old Hispano box Merc OAC is quite old and almost as old as those in spain, SG ones look nicer and modern. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
