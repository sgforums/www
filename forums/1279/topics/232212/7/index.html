Also got buses which have difficulties shifting gears like 3900J and 202K.<br><br>2) Eh which Mk2 doesn't slam door hard? Scania, Merc, whatever bus which use the old kind of doors will at some point in time just slam hard.<br><br>3) amdep has 490+ Mercs, not all Mercs are like that, you'd haven't took enough.(but I can only pick out a few like 450K from slbp which can perform well)<br><br>4) The loudest Mercs in SBST are from slbp, from exprience.<br><br>5) I did not compare bbdep with any other depots other than bndep, maybe you should try the bndep ones.<br><br>6) Ah? Why some LO3x on 179 got rubbish, got dirty windows outside. Ah and things like 9128H roars, so fix that.<br><br>7) slbp Mercs simply don't look as nice as amdep's, first impression counts.</div>

Not only like that, with the seats are mostly cracked! Taking about the cleaning, so does that justify the BC in HG are lazy and not doing any job to make it clean? Do u know? I once board VO3x on svc 87, the aircon outlet was full of dust! After I adjust it, my hands are all in black! I guess the rims dun really matters rite? Most of the B9TL rims are all dirty now!

It dun seems like the bus would collapse without it! Front seats? U mean the driver seat? where? I did not saw it leh. Personally I dun think that the Dress rims are important. I guess most of the passengers care more about seats, flooring and especially the aircon in the bus. Dress rims with or without also can go without it! I guess there are reasons why SL remove the dress rims. What the use of spending money of the dress rims? Maybe those HGDEP are the one which keeps wasting money and that contribute to the fare increase! Talking about the aircon outlet, I can say that SL ones are cleaner. At least u would not see dust stuck on the outlet where u r turning about eeryday when u r onboard!!</div>
