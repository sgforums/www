Go to an interview in an T-shirt or mismatched combination of clothing, what do your interviewer feel? Same, if slbp had Mercs as nice and clean looking as buses from other depots (maybe except the nicer ones like 450K), motorists, passengers, tourists would feel that the buses have been well kept. This is one reason why many of the members feel that SMRT buses are better (although the opposite is true)  because first impression is newer looking buses with EDS, look more modern.

I saw those on svc 242 are quite new leh. Today I saw SBS 9132U got new wheels. For SL, I think the exterior is ok.. Compared to BBDEP and BRBP.. SL had much cleaner exterior.

Rmbr the recent 960 rigid accident case?(cant rmbr its rego.) It langa with the concrete pillar and steel railing but sustain only minor damage and scratches.
