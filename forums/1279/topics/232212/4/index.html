The present buses with those A/Cs have been modified very very long ago already! I remember in 1998, 341S already had that type of A/C (but haven't make hole in interior yet).<br><br>I'm not sure when exactly it was modified though. Was it done before the buses even entered service?</div>

Consists of a toothed ring located at the axle ends or within the axle. The analogue Voltage o/p from these sensors is transmitted to an ECU located in the vehicle cabin.<br>ECU is fed on how fast each wheel is rotating. At the point when the wheel is about to lock up, the ECU outputs a signal to reduce braing force to the affected wheel. This is done by controlling the air through a modulator (for pneumatic brakes) or Brake fluid (DOT3,4,5.1) instead of air through a modulator (for hydraulic brakes).<br>Modulator valve is a solenoid controlled valve capable of dumping air/fluid being delivered to the brake chamber/caliper. This dumping of air to the slave pump (brake chamber/caliper) moemntary and is immediately followed by recharing the slave pump. The cycle of this dumping and feeding can occur many times within a second to give the wheel brake and release, brake and release effect known as ABS.<br><br>I have how the ABS valves look like those who want to know can PM me.</div>

Cause the first version Vogelsitze and the second version are different. Take the Habits first batch and second batch for example. Also, Vogelsitze the seats are not jointed in the middle. They are separate, which allows changing of covers of each seats individually. Am i right ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
