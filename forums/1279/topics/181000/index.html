This is the common problem facing from both SMRT and SBST . They should concentrate on reducing waiting . Are both companines short of buses ?<br><br>I think another issue for them is to replace the old lousy buses like SBS'T scanias and SMRT's nissan diesels . SBST's scanias are not so bad as the Nissan's but they are not comfortable for long distance routes, tried a few times and I avoid them especially the clear glass's scanias. There are two types right but same engine if I am not wrong ?<br><br>Nissan diesel is another story, the bus is super slow , lousy air con and suspension . I often take 178 and it seems they are getting more converted air con buses on the svc . These buses needs to be replaced .<br><br>Hopefully they purchase new low floor buses. I seen some poor old folks struggling to board the bus ( because of the steps ) . It's time for them to upgrade the fleet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This real time bus arrival information system is running hand in hand with the AVMS. Growth Venture (a subsidiary of Singapore Technologies) and LECIP Technologies were offered the tender to provde installation of the AVMS system in February this year. 4 temp staffs were employed by SBS Transit in Mid March 2006 to carry out AVMS readiness checks on all 2700 SBST buses, currently, Growth Venture is carrying out rectification works to AVMS systems with problems identified. The AVMS system is expected to be ready by May 2006.<br><br>The AVMS system, otherwise known as Automatic Vehicle Management System is a full fledge fleet management system which allows the SBST HQ to monitor bus deployment and unforeseen road conditions. When Bus Captains meets any emergencies or faces any troubles on the road, the AVMS systems doubles up as an Emergency Communication System for the BCs to directly communicate with the HQ. The AVMS system is running on GPRS technology instead of the latest 3G technology due to cost constraints.<br><br>The Real Time Bus Arrival Information System tender is set to be open after the AVMS system is ready for use. Currently, extensive usability test is carried out on service 88.<br><br>Hope this information is helpful =)</div>

Some other open-minded might want to know the timing. Its different for buses.
