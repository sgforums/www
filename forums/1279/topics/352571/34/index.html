              <p>Trivia</p>
              <p>A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> is a service that plies a road with a height restriction.</p>
              <p>B <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span></strong> is a service that makes a loop in the city.</p>
              <p>B <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span></strong> adopts a jump bus system and all of A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> and B's <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span></strong> buses originate from one depot/bus park.</p>
              <p>A, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> B, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span></strong> C, D and E all intercept on this road, but C and D do not call at the same bus stop at all along this road.</p>
              <p>C and D will meet again at a cross junction but C and D will turn right from opposite directions.</p>
              <p>D does not share ending point with anyone (A-L).</p>
              <p>E will cross intercept C at 2 road junctions before meeting at the road where A-E meet. E is also known to meet C at the opposite direction of E after the 2 cross-interceptions.</p>
              <p>E also plies an expressway.</p>
              <p>F intercepts B <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span></strong>, J and K all will meet up altogether at this road for only 1 stop.</p>
              <p>F, G and H will enter this road at the same and ply all the bus stop on this road before leaving this road at the same time.</p>
              <p>F is known not to meet any other service (A-L) thereafter.</p>
              <p>G and H share one ending point that all the other services (A-L) do not.</p>
              <p>H meets many services (A-L).</p>
              <p>I is a long loop service known to intercept J for 4 stops at the first 10 minutes of its journey.</p>
              <p>I and M is known to intercept H on both directions but H will only call together with I and M on 1 stop on 1 direction and none for the other.</p>
              <p>J will meet A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> when it turns right onto this road and separate when A turns right out of this road and J continues going straight. A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> and J do not call at any bus stop together.</p>
              <p>J and K's service numbers have 2 identical digits, one of which is the last one. example, sv143 and sv543.</p>
              <p>L meets all services except E.</p>
              <p>L is known to intercept D for at least 6 stops before splitting and meeting again for at least 6 stops.</p>
              <p>H, B and L are the only SBST Trunk known to ply this road along with M.</p>
              <p>M shares one ending point with L and the other with A and C.</p>
              <p>M will intercept with I for many stops at one point of time and 1 or 2 stops at the next time they meet.</p>

              <p>A to K are 11 basic services operated by either SBST or SMRT. A-G have DD while H-K do not.</p>
              <p>A has B9TLs. A goes to only one train station and goes by an industrial area. In additon A meets B and H at a road but B and H do not call at the same stop together.</p>
              <p>B has SLBP control. B has only one perm batch 1 KUB and several batch 2s.</p>
              <p>C ends at the same int/ter as B in town T1. C has the longest routing in town T2 which is the other end.</p>
              <p>D uses the same int/ter as A. There are two more A-D meetings, both near MRT tracks, however the two svcs do not call at the same stop except the int/ter. D also meets E at one of the two meetings.</p>
              <p>E goes from a depot to a terminal.</p>
              <p>F is a square number. F shares an int/ter with D. F will meet D again near M1 Station and duplicate until M2 station. They then split up and do not meet again.</p>
              <p>G is a prime number. It meets F for two stops in either direction in town T3. They also meet again in the central area of singapore.</p>
              <p>H goes between two terminals. From one end, after two left turns, H meets F. H uses and expressway and goes within walking distance from the other end, which is also served by E.</p>
              <p>I used to go to the city area but was shortened. Currently I makes a u turn and does not serve any NSL or EWL stations. I meets D at a junction.</p>
              <p>J does not meet any other services in this trivia. J runs almost identical to another service F+C-H however J uses a road with two stops, exclusive to J near one end and the two services use two parallel roads at another.</p>

              <p>G and H share one ending point that all the other services (A-L) do not.</p>
              <p>H meets many services (A-L).</p>
              <p>I is a long loop service known to intercept J for 4 stops at the first 10 minutes of its journey.</p>
              <p>I and M is known to intercept H on both directions but H will only call together with I and M on 1 stop on 1 direction and none for the other.</p>
              <p>J will meet A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> when it turns right onto this road and separate when A turns right out of this road and J continues going straight. A <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span></strong> and J do not call at any bus stop together.</p>
              <p>J and K's service numbers have 2 identical digits, one of which is the last one. example, sv143 and sv543.</p>
              <p>L meets all services except E.</p>
              <p>L is known to intercept D for at least 6 stops before splitting and meeting again for at least 6 stops.</p>
              <p>H, B and L are the only SBST Trunk known to ply this road along with M.</p>
              <p>M shares one ending point with L and the other with A and C.</p>
              <p>M will intercept with I for many stops at one point of time and 1 or 2 stops at the next time they meet.</p>
