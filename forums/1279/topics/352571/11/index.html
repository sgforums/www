                                      service. D is a service that terminate at the northwestern side of
                                      singapore. E terminates in the northeastern side of singapore. F
                                      terminates at the CBD area. G terminates at a terminal with just 1
                                      service. H terminates at the eastern side of singapore. I

                                      somewhere in the west. D &amp; F intersect/meets somewhere. E intersect/meets H
                                      somewhere and both meets each other until it reaches a certain place. F intersect/meet H at a road which goes past an entrance of a MRT station. G intersect/meets B &amp;
                                      C at the same place in the west. G and I intersect/meets somewhere near orchard area. name all
                                      the services. also name all the places/roads that the bus services

              <p>2a) by using D &amp; F (letters not in order, you can mix the 2
                                      letters around), you can subtract them to get another bus service
                                      number. does this bus service intersect/meet any bus services from
                                      A - I? where?</p>
              <p>2b) what bus service number is derived from A + C - I? what

              <p>questions:<br><br>1) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I are different kinds of bus service.</p>
              <p><strong>147 </strong>A terminates at the central/north-eastern part of singapore and goes past an industrial area. <strong>196</strong> B is a clementi service. <strong>61/93</strong> C is a eunos service. <strong>75/77 </strong>D is a service that terminate at the northwestern side of singapore. <strong>151 </strong>E terminates in the northeastern side of singapore. <strong>106</strong> F terminates at the CBD area. <strong>64 </strong>G terminates at a terminal with just 1 service. <strong>65</strong> H terminates at the eastern side of singapore. <strong>56/123/131/139/143/166/857/980  </strong>I terminates somewhere.</p>
              <p><strong>147 </strong>A intersects/meets <strong>196 </strong>B &amp; <strong>61/93</strong> C at different places (<strong>147</strong> A &amp; <strong>196 </strong>B intersect at <strong>Buona Vista </strong>somewhere and meets each other until <strong>SGH </strong>at cbd area, <strong>147 </strong>A &amp; <strong>61/93</strong> C intersect at <strong>Queensway/C'wealth Ave </strong>somewhere). <strong>196 </strong>B &amp; <strong>106</strong> F intersect/meets <strong>C'wealth Ave Blk 43 and C'wealth Ave West outside Clementi Temp Int </strong>somewhere in the west. <strong>75/77</strong> D &amp; <strong>106</strong> F intersect/meets at <strong>Holland/Napier Rd </strong>somewhere. <strong>151 </strong>E intersect/meets <strong>65</strong> H somewhere and both meets each other <strong>Woodsville Flyover </strong>until it reaches <strong>Macpherson/Aljunied Rd junction </strong>a certain place. <strong>106</strong> F intersect/meet <strong>65</strong> H at a road which goes past an entrance of a <strong>Orchard/Somerset/Dhoby Ghaut </strong>MRT station. <strong>64 </strong>G intersect/meets <strong>196</strong> B &amp; <strong>61/93</strong> C at the <strong>Queensway </strong>same place in the west. <strong>64 </strong>G and <strong>56/123/131/139/143/166/857/980 </strong>I intersect/meets somewhere near orchard area. name all the services. also name all the places/roads that the bus services intersect, meets at and terminates.</p>
              <p>2a) by using <strong>75</strong> D &amp; <strong>106</strong> F (letters not in order, you can mix the 2 letters around), you can subtract them to get another bus service <strong>31 </strong>number. does this bus service intersect/meet any bus services from A - I? where?<br><strong>147 A - S'goon/Bendemeer Rd<br>196 B - Marine Parade Rd/Bedok South Rd<br>61/93 C - Bendemeer Rd for 61, none for 93<br>75/77 D - None<br>151 E - Jln Toa Payoh<br>106 F - None<br>64 G - S'goon/Bendemeer Rd<br>65 H - S'goon/Bendemeer Rd, Tampines Ave 5<br>56/123/131/139/143/166/857/980 I - 139/143 at Toa Payoh Int, 857 at S'goon/Bendemeer Rd, rest none. </strong></p>
              <p>2b) what bus service number is derived from A + C - I? what service from B,D,E,F,G,H does this bus service intersect/meet (not including A, C &amp; I)?</p>

              <p>K is wrong. Its SWT 33A is in the evening and its reverse downroute is in the morning. 33A only 2 trips. This service has many SWT trips. Moreover 33 doesnt go North-East.</p>

              <p><br>Wrong. Though it was extended from Toa Payoh to Serangoon. Serangoon jump bus only got 82 100 101 as compared to 81 103 315 317, not counting 105 109 as its dual depot. In addition, I does jump bus itself. 158 doesn't.</p>

              <p>Hmm looks like I have gave G an isolated clue. If i add one more clue for G you guys would be able to guess some of the remaining ones cos G intersects a few of the remaining ones.</p>

              <p><br> 36 is not the only service that has a bus stop in a vehicle park.
              Vehicle park can stand for any kind of vehicles that may park in it
              as long as there's lots catered for it.</p>
              <p>G is 240 :)</p>
              <p>K is wrong. Its SWT 33A is in the evening and its reverse
              downroute is in the morning. 33A only 2 trips. This service has
              many SWT trips. Moreover 33 doesnt go North-East.</p>
              <p><br> Both are wrong though both originates from Clementi and both serve
              Dover estate before branching out. Moreover, 14 did not have
              the most perm models at one point. This service E i'm looking for
              had the most perm models recently and not currently.</p>
              <p><br> If H is 10 then what is E, I and J? Though 10 did serve Somapah
              before.</p>
              <p><br> Wrong. Though it was extended from Toa Payoh to Serangoon.
              Serangoon jump bus only got 82 100 101 as compared to 81 103 315
              317, not counting 105 109 as its dual depot. In addition, I does
              jump bus itself. 158 doesn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm looks like I have gave G an isolated clue. If i
              add one more clue for G you guys would be able to guess some of the
              remaining ones cos G intersects a few of the remaining ones.</p>

              <p><br>nope.. 156A operates in the morning and evening, while its downroute from Thomson Rd only operates in the evening. In addition, 156 does not have any buses that supplement other services.</p>
