              <p>My first trivia to be done in a proper fashion, don't rubbish me
              for this thx.</p>
              <p>____________________________________________________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are altogether 18 bus services(A to R) in this trivia,
              with a mix of SBST and SMRT Buses services. All services are
              technically trunk services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> is a relatively new
              service(under three years) and allows people from this small town
              Z<span style="color: #ff0000;">(Simei)</span> in the East a direct
              connection to the city. This town Z<span style="color: #ff0000;">(Simei)</span> has no feeder/townlink services
              going through it and does not have an Int/Ter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span> is a cross
              territorial trunk service that now operates from an Interchange in
              the East. During its time at this Interchange in the East, this
              service has been shortened twice to its current route. It operated
              to another Interchange in the East(which is now closed) before
              being moved to the current one more than 25 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> is a loop service
              which has high demand. However it has a full fleet of SDs due to
              height restriction at two roads along its route. Of which one of
              the two road it meets G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span>.
              This road has a hospital which is quite small but old. Thus
              G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> also has a height
              restriction imposed on it and does not have DDs too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> is a service which
              was once called the longest loop service in Singapore. Not any
              more. This service has been rerouted to this Interchange. A
              previous service operated from this Interchange to this terminal.
              After that service was terminated, D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> was amended to serve the Interchange.
              The other terminating point for D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> is the same terminal that the
              previous service used to terminate at. D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> also has a height restriction, thus
              no DDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> is a WAB service. It
              has consistent high loads throughout the week but makes a big round
              at its terminating point in the Central area(but outside of
              CBD).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>F is a service which just a few days ago received a very
              interesting cameo. It has a height restriction too, and is a "loop
              service", though it runs from an Interchange in the East to this
              Terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> is a long distance
              trunk service which has a height restriction, as mentioned above.
              It goes through many narrow roads(one laners) along its journey
              from East to West.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H<span style="color: #ff0000;">(42)</span> is a short distance
              trunk. This service is unique because there are no resting
              facilities for BCs at the start/terminating point. There is also
              something unique about the perm buses on this service. DDs cannot
              be used on this route at all. This service has a low demand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I<span style="color: #ff0000;">(58)</span> can also be
              considered a relatively new service. One of its terminating points
              is at an Interchange in the Central/North area of Singapore. This
              service used to have a lot of different bus types perm-ing on this
              route.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span> is a WAB service. One
              of its terminating points is at a Terminal. One of its perm B9TLs
              has a very horrible handbrake sound(akin to a gorrilla's explosive
              fart). This service has exceptionally high demand. It also passes
              by an Interchange in the North-east.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> is a service which
              go through hilly terrain but has perm B9TLs. Also high demand
              service, and terminates at a Terminal. There is exceptionally high
              demand when a University, two polytechnics and a few schools along
              this stretch of road have lessons. It has a Fast Forward service
              K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span><em>e</em> and
              K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> starts from this
              Interchange where J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span> has a
              stop outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>L<span style="color: #ff0000;">(153)</span> starts from the same
              Interchange as K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> and
              terminates at an Interchange which two other services A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> ply too...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> is a service that
              duplicates K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> for a very
              long distance. It faces high loading during school terms...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>N and O<span style="color: #ff0000;">(189)</span> are from the
              same Interchange. N loops at an MRT Stn and the Interchange near
              that station has service Q. N duplicates K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> and M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> for a few stops along a certain
              road. N also has high loadings during school term. O<span style="color: #ff0000;">(189)</span> loops at a Terminal which
              B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span>, G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span>, and K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> ply to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P is a service renowned for its extremely high loading and
              frequencies. This service duplicates D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> for a few stops along a few roads. It
              provides a quick link from the Central district to the North-west
              of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q<span style="color: #ff0000;">(196)</span> is a long distance
              trunk service from East to West. High loadings as it passes by
              numerous schools. It is also a WAB service. This service passes
              through the CBD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R is a service which goes to a very "ulu" part of Singapore. It
              only meets P for a few stops. However it has high loadings during
              Friday and Sunday nights.</p>

              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span>, E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> and I<span style="color: #ff0000;">(58)</span> terminate at the same
              Interchange.</p>
              <p>B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span>, F and J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span> terminate at the same
              Interchange.</p>
              <p>B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span>, G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span>, K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span>, and O<span style="color: #ff0000;">(189)</span> terminate at the same Terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> branches out from the Interchange in
              the same way but A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> goes
              straight while E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> turns
              right. C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and I branch out
              from the Interchange in the same direction but do not meet at bus
              stops as C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> turns left
              while I goes straight. C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet along a nearby
              Town from that Interchange. However C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> takes a much more direct(and thus
              faster) routing than E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>.
              There will be a bus stop X near a NKF/KDF place whereby
              A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span>, and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet. After that bus stop
              C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> will go straight, while
              A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> turn left. Before this bus stop
              however, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and
              E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet each other for 3
              bus stops(in each direction). A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span>, E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>, and this time with I will meet yet
              again for a few bus stops. This time, E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> will turn left, while A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and I will go straight. It is worthy
              to note that E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>, after
              turning left at bus stop X, continues down this road till the other
              end. And A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> will meet
              C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> for the last time along
              a road which A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> would not
              meet up with C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and P meet each other
              for a few stops in the CBD. D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> would turn left and meet
              A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and both would terminate
              at the same Terminal. P would turn right and continue its journey
              down to its terminating point in the North-western region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It can also be said that D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and Q meet and diverge from each
              other for a few times. Both are from the same Interchange.
              D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and Q come out from the
              Interchange in the same direction, diverge after a condo, meet
              after a school and diverge after another school. They then meet
              again along a road which is very famous due to an incident. They
              diverge for the last time after a stop along this also famous
              building/s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H<span style="color: #ff0000;">(42)</span> is a service that
              only meets services E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> and
              G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> in one direction for
              only one bus stop. After this it turns right to continue on its
              journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I<span style="color: #ff0000;">(58)</span> is a service that
              duplicates 59 for many bus stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span>, as said earlier, has
              good yields.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span>, L<span style="color: #ff0000;">(153)</span>, and M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> meet up at a bus stop on a road
              along an expressway. That is the only time all four services meet
              up together. M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> also stops
              along bus stops on a road along another expressway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R only meets up with one service, P. It then proceeds to west of
              this Town, and after passing through it, will come back again. It
              will stop outside and opp this famous mall in the Northwestern
              region.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">You are given 15 different SBS Transit basic bus services: A – O, Institutions P and Q, Terminating Point R, Institution S</span></span></p>
              <p>A has a Special1 schedule which will operate when Institution P is on holiday.</p>
              <p>B has added 3 buses to its overnight parking terminating point since January 2009. Both A and B meet at this MRT Station and does not meet each other anywhere near thereafter.</p>
              <p>C is a service that operates Special1 on a regular basis (more frequent than 4 times a year). It intersects A near an MRT station that is different from the previous paragraph.</p>
              <p>D operates Holiday1 twice a year. It passes by Institution Q and passes by A’s terminating point. It intersects B for 2 pairs of bus stops before terminating at R.</p>
              <p>E is a pan-island service. It serves Institution Q and goes past a place where you can find a Xin Wang Hong Kong Café. It shares the same terminating point with two of the other unknown services A-O.</p>
              <p>F went past four Carl’s Junior Outlets. Two of which had since closed down<strong>.</strong> It passes by a place where there’s a speed camera. It has added a split shift bus (es) recently.</p>
              <p>G goes to two polyclinics<strong>.</strong> It used to loop at the estate that one polyclinic is situated at. It shares a terminating point with A</p>
              <p>H is a service that once upon a time does not have supplementary buses in 2004. Currently, it has 4 supplementary buses serving 3 supplementary routes from one of its terminating point, making it the only service in Singapore to have buses leaving its parent service within a short period of time from one terminating point.</p>
              <p>I is a service used to have a supplementary bus that served a route that is not under its controlling depot. It was removed when a certain service was introduced. (You are not required to answer which service this is) Currently, it has 2 supplementary buses serving 2 different routes, one from each end of its terminating point. One of its supplementary services intersects B and D at the same place as mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>J has a P shift that operates at least four trips of a SWT after the evening peak. It currently does not have any supplementary buses. It shares one of its terminating points with A and I.</p>
              <p>K used to adopt a jump bus system but was removed recently due to certain confusions. It has since added split shift buses and introduced an additional supplementary trip on its supplementary service. It shares a terminating point with B</p>
              <p>L is a service that operates Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have 2 different supplementary buses to 1 supplementary service, at different times of the day. The supplementary service suffered a reduction in frequency after the supplementary buses were removed.</p>
              <p>M used to have a supplementary bus from another service on its SWT. It was removed when M’s schedule had a revamp. Due to this revamp, another supplementary bus that used to serve M was removed as well. Its SWT route was amended twice ever since it was extended to terminate at this place. It shares the same terminating point as G</p>
              <p>N operates Special1 schedule when Institution S is on holiday. It used to have supplementary buses from O before 2004. Thereafter, these supplementary buses were removed when O’s variant service was introduced.</p>
              <p>O used to be a real pan-island long route but one of its terminating points was amended twice to its current one. It has a variant service and used to do supplementary trips on N. Coincidentally, one of its terminating points is shared with 3 other services here.</p>

              <p>O used to be a real pan-island long route but one of its
