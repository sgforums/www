              <p>there are 18 bus services from A - R, 3 roads from S - U, 1
              expressway V, 1 terminal W.<br> <br> A is a service that starts/terminates, not a loop service, at
              eunos.<br> B is a 1 way service which operates only in the morning.<br> C is a service which operates another alternate service after
              evening on weekdays, afternoon on saturdays and whole day on
              sundays and PHs.<br> D is a service which also operates another alternate service
              similar to C.<br> E is a 1 way service that operates only during peak hours on
              weekdays and unknown for other days<br> F is a service that starts/terminates from jurong east<br> G is a service that doesn't terminate at a proper terminal and
              which the terminal has no resting place for BCs to rest before
              continuing their journey.<br> H is a service which terminates in a eastern interchange<br> I is a service which terminates somewhere near a cross-border
              place<br> J is a service which both interchanges it terminates at are
              air-conditioned<br> K is a service which terminates at a western terminal<br> L is a service which, like G, doesn't terminate at a proper
              terminal and which the terminal has no resting place for BCs to
              rest before continuing their journey.<br> M is a service which terminates at a north-eastern
              interchange.<br> N is a service which loops at a road quite near to a MRT
              station.<br> O is a service which starts/terminates at a CBD terminal<br> P is a service which terminates at a western interchange<br> Q is a service which terminates at a terminal that doesn't allow
              boarding and alighting.<br> R is a service which terminates at a north-western terminal<br> <br> S is a road that L pass by, which this is the only main road where
              there is 1 bus stop for L to meet other services. after this bus
              stop, L will only meet 1 bus service at a smaller road. this
              service that L meets terminates at an eastern interchange.<br> B and J pass by a road T, which B starts service from this
              particular road. however B and J will not meet each other at
              all.<br> C &amp; D pass by 2 roads U with their alternate services. however,
              C &amp; D pass by in opposite directions (1 direction each for C
              &amp; D for whole trip) and both services doesn't touch each
              other's direction, nor does it stop at each other's bus
              stops.<br> A &amp; R pass by a expressway V. however, A &amp; R will not meet
              each other at all at V though before entering V, A &amp; R meet up
              at this road at the west.<br> <br> A and H intersect each other for 5 bus stops in 2 roads together.
              in the other directions. they intersect for 4 bus stops in 3 roads
              together. 1 of the place where they intersect/separate is near an
              expressway.<br> A and F intersect each other at a bus stop on a road along an
              expressway. after that, A and F does not intersect each
              other.<br> A intersect Q for 2 bus stops at the same road. in other
              directions, A intersect Q for 3 bus stops, also at the same
              road.<br> C and P intersect each other for 5 bus stops in 2 different roads.
              however, when C is operating its alternate service, both service
              intersect each other for 7 bus stops in 4 different roads. in other
              directions, C and P intersect each other for 6 bus stops in 4
              different roads and 8 bus stops in 5 different roads when C
              operates its alternate service.<br> D and K intersect each other at 2 roads for 4 bus stops each and 3
              different roads for 3 bus stops together, which C, D, K and O
              intersects. for O, it also intersects K for 1 more bus stop at a
              road before both link up to the road which C, D, K and O
              intersects. in the other directions, C and K intersect for 4 bus
              stops at 3 roads together, D and K intersect for 9 bus stops in a
              few roads together before separating and intersecting at another
              road for 4 bus stops while O and K intersect for 5 bus stops at 3
              roads together. it is unknown of whether C,D and O does still
              intersect each other after they separate with K.<br> F, H and an unknown service terminates at the same
              interchange.<br> I and N starts/terminates at the same interchange. after I &amp; N
              departs from the interchange, I intersect N for 1 bus stop at a
              road. both of them intersect at the bus stop opposite this, except
              that they are going back to the same interchange.<br> 3 unknown services terminates at the same terminal W<br> E does not intersect any of the 17 unknown bus service, not do they
              terminate at the same interchanges/terminals as any of the 17
              unknown bus services.<br> G intersect C, D, O for 2 bus stops on 2 different roads. however,
              when G intersect them, C, D &amp; O would be travelling towards
              different directions for 1 of the bus stop; the other bus stop C, D
              &amp; O would be travelling toward the same place..<br> H &amp; J intersect with each other for 3 bus stops on 3 different
              roads before separating.<br> H &amp; M terminates at the same interchange. M does not intersect
              any of the other 17 services.<br> P &amp; R intersect each other for 8 bus stops in 3 different
              roads.<br> <br> what are the 18 bus services, the 4 roads and the terminal? give
              reasons for your answers. when needed, also show the other bus
              stops and roads which the different services intersect at, the
