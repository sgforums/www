              <p><br>36 is not the only service that has a bus stop in a vehicle park. Vehicle park can stand for any kind of vehicles that may park in it as long as there's lots catered for it.</p>
              <p>G is 240 :)</p>
              <p>K is wrong. Its SWT 33A is in the evening and its reverse downroute is in the morning. 33A only 2 trips. This service has many SWT trips. Moreover 33 doesnt go North-East.</p>
              <p><br>Both are wrong though both originates from Clementi and both serve Dover estate before branching out. Moreover, 14 did not have the most perm models at one point. This service E i'm looking for had the most perm models recently and not currently.</p>
              <p><br>If H is 10 then what is E, I and J? Though 10 did serve Somapah before.</p>
              <p><br>Wrong. Though it was extended from Toa Payoh to Serangoon. Serangoon jump bus only got 82 100 101 as compared to 81 103 315 317, not counting 105 109 as its dual depot. In addition, I does jump bus itself. 158 doesn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm looks like I have gave G an isolated clue. If i add one more clue for G you guys would be able to guess some of the remaining ones cos G intersects a few of the remaining ones.</p>

              D is 30. Estate in common with E is Taman Jurong.

              <p>I state before anyone started posting their answers. The only edit in the main question is the insertion of G's answer. I stated earlier that it has many SWT <strong>trips</strong>, not many suffixes. 158 only has 7 trips each for 158A and 158B. if you still feel K = 158, then answer the remaining clue that is pertaining to K <br><br>"2 buses from this service does supplementary trips on 2 seperate services. K meets A &amp; B at a road near an MRT station and a fire station. A &amp; B will go straight while K turns left after meeting. Though they meet at this road, K &amp; A/B do not call at any bus stops together."</p>

Of the 4 services, 3 will turn right <strong>(31, 32, 33)</strong> while the 4th one <strong>(30) </strong>turns left at this junction. <strong>(Old Airport Rd/Mountbatten Rd)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>32 </strong>A &amp; <strong>33 </strong>B are identical in their routes as they meet and run parallel 3 times, one of which is mentioned in the earlier paragraph. <strong>(New Upp Changi Rd-Sims Ave East/Changi Rd, Dunman/Tg Katong Rd-Hill St/North Bridge Rd/North Boat Quay, Tiong Bahru/Lower Delta Rd-Tiong Bahru/Alexandra Rd)</strong></p>

              <p><strong>98 </strong>F also serves the same estate as <strong>30</strong> D &amp; <strong>154</strong> E but originate from a different terminating point <strong>(Jurong East)</strong>.

              <p><strong>155</strong> H intersects <strong>154</strong> E for 5 pairs of bus stops in this estate <strong>(Macpherson)</strong>. <strong>155</strong> H also intersects <strong>135</strong> I and <strong>966</strong> J at 2 different places <strong>(135 at Siglap Rd/Macpherson Estate/Upp Aljunied Rd, 966 at Still Rd)</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>135</strong> I was extended to terminate at this place <strong>(Ang Mo Kio)</strong> that has many jump bus services <strong>(22, 24, 25, 73, 86, 130, 133, 135, 136)</strong>. It intersects <strong>155</strong> H at a road <strong>(Upp Aljunied Rd)</strong> that does not have DDs plying.</p>
              <p><strong>966</strong> J has a crossover from another service <strong>963</strong> in the morning. It runs parallel with <strong>59</strong> L for a portion of <strong>966</strong> J's express sector <strong>(PIE between Kallang Bahru and Eunos Flyover)</strong>. It doesn't call the same stops as <strong>59</strong> L though they share the same express sector. <strong>966</strong> J meets <strong>155</strong> H at a junction <strong>(Sims Ave/Jln Eunos)</strong> nearest to an <strong>Eunos</strong> MRT station. <strong>966</strong> J meets <strong>135</strong> I for 2 pairs of bus stops near a famous shopping centre <strong>(Parkway)</strong> that shares the same name of a healthcare company <strong>(Parkway Holdings)</strong>.</p>
