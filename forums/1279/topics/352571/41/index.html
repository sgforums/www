              <p>The following is an autobiography of service <strong>A</strong>.
              Identify A to H.</p>
              <p><em>I was born virtually an orphan - shortly after, my
              parents abandoned me while I was very young. (Event
              <strong>B</strong>) I was adopted and brought up by my foster
              parents, who treated me as very special and pampered me with a lot
              of goodies (<strong>C</strong>) which others did not have.
              Eventually, I managed to outgrow from having these.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>Upon reaching adulthood, I managed to have my first son
              (<strong>D</strong>). He shares one of the homes (Terminus
              <strong>E</strong>) as I do, and more than often when we both go
              out he tends to outrun me. Eventually, he decides to settle down,
              strike out on his own, and even has a new identity
              (<strong>F</strong>). I'm glad that I'm a grandfather now, as my
              first son has given birth to a grandson (<strong>G</strong>) not
              too long ago. Just as how his father was in his youth, our grandson
              loves running around, too!<br></em></p>
              <p><em>It may sound odd to you, but we also have a second son
              (<strong>H</strong>) now. He's not as prolific as our first son,
              but I know for sure he's very close to me. I may be an old man now,
              but my appearance has changed very little since the days of my
              youth.</em></p>

              <p>Nope! not 179.</p>
              <p>Clue for service A. Only 2 digit number. Have full fleet of a particular bus before and now have a full fleet of another particular bus.</p>
              <p>Service B is the older "Brother/Sister" to Service A. Now some of the buses have been transfer to another Service due to the Wheel Chair Accessibility.</p>
              <p>Service C is popular among bus fans who like to take photo at this particular place.</p>
              <p>The most busiest place in Singapore is located somewhere near the place where this place of worship have their masses at.</p>
