              <p><br>I believe if I state each unknown service all the other parts will fall in place nicely. You need these details to determine the same so what's the point in saying where they terminate or when was the amendment or extension or what was the former service etc.</p>

              <p>A to K are 11 basic services operated by either SBST or SMRT. A-G have DD while H-K do not.</p>
              <p>A has B9TLs. A goes to only one train station and goes by an industrial area. In additon A meets B and H at a road but B and H do not call at the same stop together.</p>
              <p>B has SLBP control. B has only one perm batch 1 KUB and several batch 2s.</p>
              <p>C ends at the same int/ter as B in town T1. C has the longest routing in town T2 which is the other end.</p>
              <p>D uses the same int/ter as A. There are two more A-D meetings, both near MRT tracks, however the two svcs do not call at the same stop except the int/ter. D also meets E at one of the two meetings.</p>
              <p>E goes from a depot to a terminal.</p>
              <p>F is a square number. F shares an int/ter with D. F will meet D again near M1 Station and duplicate until M2 station. They then split up and do not meet again.</p>
              <p>G is a prime number. It meets F for two stops in either direction in town T3. They also meet again in the central area of singapore.</p>
              <p>H goes between two terminals. From one end, after two left turns, H meets F. H uses and expressway and goes within walking distance from the other end, which is also served by E.</p>
              <p>I used to go to the city area but was shortened. Currently I makes a u turn and does not serve any NSL or EWL stations. I meets D at a junction.</p>
              <p>J does not meet any other services in this trivia. J runs almost identical to another service F+C-H however J uses a road with two stops, exclusive to J near one end and the two services use two parallel roads at another.</p>
              <p>K and E are the only two basic svcs at road R1. K is a loop service which makes a U turn. K shares one end with B.</p>
              <p>What are:</p>
              <p>svcs A B C D E F G H I J K?<br>Towns T1, T2, T3?<br>Stations M1, M2?<br>Road R1?</p>
