              <p>My first trivia to be done in a proper fashion, don't rubbish me for this thx.</p>
              <p>____________________________________________________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There
                                          are altogether 18 bus services(A to R) in this trivia, with a mix of
                                          SBST and SMRT Buses services. All services are technically trunk
                                          services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> is a relatively new service(under three
                                          years) and allows people from this small town Z<span style="color: #ff0000;">(Simei)</span> in the East a direct
                                          connection to the city. This town Z<span style="color: #ff0000;">(Simei)</span> has no feeder/townlink services
                                          going through it and does not have an Int/Ter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span> is a
                                          cross territorial trunk service that now operates from an Interchange
                                          in the East. During its time at this Interchange in the East, this
                                          service has been shortened twice to its current route. It operated to
                                          another Interchange in the East(which is now closed) before being moved
                                          to the current one more than 25 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> is a loop
                                          service which has high demand. However it has a full fleet of SDs due
                                          to height restriction at two roads along its route. Of which one of the
                                          two road it meets G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span>. This road has a hospital which is quite small but
                                          old. Thus G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> also has a height restriction imposed on it and does not
                                          have DDs too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> is a service which was once called the
                                          longest loop service in Singapore. Not any more. This service has been
                                          rerouted to this Interchange. A previous service operated from this
                                          Interchange to this terminal. After that service was terminated, D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> was
                                          amended to serve the Interchange. The other terminating point for D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> is
                                          the same terminal that the previous service used to terminate at. D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> also has a height restriction, thus no DDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> is a WAB
                                          service. It has consistent high loads throughout the week but makes a
                                          big round at its terminating point in the Central area(but outside of
                                          CBD).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>F<span style="color: #ff0000;">(29)</span> is a service which just a few days ago
                                          received a very interesting cameo. It has a height restriction too, and
                                          is a "loop service", though it runs from an Interchange in the East to
                                          this Terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> is a long distance trunk service
                                          which has a height restriction, as mentioned above. It goes through
                                          many narrow roads(one laners) along its journey from East to West.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H<span style="color: #ff0000;">(42)</span> is a short distance trunk. This service is unique because there are no
                                          resting facilities for BCs at the start/terminating point. There is
                                          also something unique about the perm buses on this service. DDs cannot
                                          be used on this route at all. This service has a low demand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I<span style="color: #ff0000;">(58)</span> can also be considered a relatively new service. One of its terminating
                                          points is at an Interchange in the Central/North area of Singapore.
                                          This service used to have a lot of different bus types perm-ing on this
                                          route.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span> is a WAB service. One of its terminating
                                          points is at a Terminal. One of its perm B9TLs has a very horrible
                                          handbrake sound(akin to a gorrilla's explosive fart). This service has
                                          exceptionally high demand. It also passes by an Interchange in the
                                          North-east.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> is a service which go through hilly
                                          terrain but has perm B9TLs. Also high demand service, and terminates at
                                          a Terminal. There is exceptionally high demand when a University, two
                                          polytechnics and a few schools along this stretch of road have lessons.
                                          It has a Fast Forward service K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span><em>e</em> and K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> starts from this Interchange where J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span> has a stop outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>L<span style="color: #ff0000;">(153)</span> starts from the same Interchange as K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> and terminates at an Interchange which two other services A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> ply too...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> is a service that duplicates K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> for a very long distance. It faces high loading during school terms...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>N<span style="color: #ff0000;">(184)</span> and O<span style="color: #ff0000;">(189)</span> do not come from the same Interchange. N<span style="color: #ff0000;">(184)</span> loops at an MRT Stn and the
                                          Interchange near that station has service Q<span style="color: #ff0000;">(196)</span>. N<span style="color: #ff0000;">(184)</span> duplicates K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> and M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> for a
                                          few stops along a certain road. N<span style="color: #ff0000;">(184)</span> also has high loadings during school
                                          term. O<span style="color: #ff0000;">(189)</span> loops at a Terminal which B<span style="color: #ff0000;">(10)</span>, G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span>, and K<span style="color: #ff0000;">(151)</span> ply to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P
                                          is a service renowned for its extremely high loading and frequencies.
                                          This service duplicates D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> for a few stops along a few roads. It
                                          provides a quick link from the Central district to the North-west of
                                          Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q<span style="color: #ff0000;">(196)</span> is a long distance trunk service from
                                          East to West. High loadings as it passes by numerous schools. It is
                                          also a WAB service. This service passes through the CBD.</p>

              <p>R
                                          is a service which goes to a very "ulu" part of Singapore. It only
                                          meets P for a few stops. However it has high loadings during Friday and
                                          Sunday nights.</p>

                                          straight while E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> turns right. C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and I branch out from the Interchange
                                          in the same direction but do not meet at bus stops as C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> turns left
                                          while I goes straight. C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet along a nearby Town from that
                                          Interchange. However C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> takes a much more direct(and thus faster)
                                          routing than E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>. There will be a bus stop X near a NKF/KDF place whereby
                                          A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span>, and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet.

Before this bus stop however, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> meet each other for 3
                                          bus stops(in each direction). A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span>, E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>, and this time with I will meet
                                          yet again for a few bus stops. This time, E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> will turn left, while A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>, C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> and I will go straight. It is worthy to note that E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span>, after turning left
                                          at bus stop X, continues down this road till the other end. And A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> will
                                          meet C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> for the last time along a road which A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> would not meet up with C<span style="color: #ff0000;">(15)</span> again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and P meet each other for a few stops in the
                                          CBD. D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> would turn left and meet A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span> and both would terminate at the same
                                          Terminal. P would turn right and continue its journey down to its
                                          terminating point in the North-western region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It can
                                          also be said that D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and Q<span style="color: #ff0000;">(196)</span> meet and diverge from each other for a few
                                          times. Both are from the same Interchange. D<span style="color: #ff0000;">(16)</span> and Q<span style="color: #ff0000;">(196)</span> come out from the
                                          Interchange in the same direction, diverge after a condo, meet after a
                                          school and diverge after another school. They then meet again along a
                                          road which is very famous due to an incident. They diverge for the last
                                          time after a stop along this also famous building/s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H<span style="color: #ff0000;">(42)</span> is a service that only meets services E<span style="color: #ff0000;">(21)</span> and G<span style="color: #ff0000;">(33)</span> in one direction for only
                                          one bus stop. After this it turns right to continue on its journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I<span style="color: #ff0000;">(58)</span> is a service that duplicates 59 for many bus stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J<span style="color: #ff0000;">(72)</span>, as said earlier, has good yields.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A<span style="color: #ff0000;">(5)</span>,

                                          is the only time all four services meet up together. M<span style="color: #ff0000;">(154)</span> also stops along
                                          bus stops on a road along another expressway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R meets up with one service, P. It then proceeds to west of this Town,
                                          and after passing through it, will come back again. It will stop
                                          outside and opp this famous mall in the Northwestern region.</p>

              <p>My first trivia to be done in a proper fashion, don't rubbish me for this thx.</p>
              <p>____________________________________________________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are altogether 18 bus services(A to R) in this trivia, with a mix of SBST and SMRT Buses services. All services are technically trunk services.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A is a relatively new service(under three years) and allows people from this small town Z in the East a direct connection to the city. This town Z has no feeder/townlink services going through it and does not have an Int/Ter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>B is a cross territorial trunk service that now operates from an Interchange in the East. During its time at this Interchange in the East, this service has been shortened twice to its current route. It operated to another Interchange in the East(which is now closed) before being moved to the current one more than 25 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C is a loop service which has high demand. However it has a full fleet of SDs due to height restriction at two roads along its route. Of which one of the two road it meets G. This road has a hospital which is quite small but old. Thus G also has a height restriction imposed on it and does not have DDs too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D is a service which was once called the longest loop service in Singapore. Not any more. This service has been rerouted to this Interchange. A previous service operated from this Interchange to this terminal. After that service was terminated, D was amended to serve the Interchange. The other terminating point for D is the same terminal that the previous service used to terminate at. D also has a height restriction, thus no DDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>E is a WAB service. It has consistent high loads throughout the week but makes a big round at its terminating point in the Central area(but outside of CBD).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>F is a service which just a few days ago received a very interesting cameo. It has a height restriction too, and is a "loop service", though it runs from an Interchange in the East to this Terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>G is a cross territorial trunk service which has a height restriction, as mentioned above. It goes through many narrow roads(one laners) along its journey from East to West.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>H is a short distance trunk. This service is unique because there are no resting facilities for BCs at the start/terminating point. There is also something unique about the perm buses on this service. DDs cannot be used on this route at all. This service has a low demand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can also be considered a relatively new service. One of its terminating points is at an Interchange in the Central/North area of Singapore. This service used to have a lot of different bus types perm-ing on this route.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J is a WAB service. One of its terminating points is at a Terminal. One of its perm B9TLs has a very horrible handbrake sound(akin to a gorrilla's explosive fart). This service has exceptionally high demand. It also passes by an Interchange in the North-east.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>K is a service which go through hilly terrain but has perm B9TLs. Also high demand service, and terminates at a Terminal. There is exceptionally high demand when a University, two polytechnics and a few schools along this stretch of road have lessons. It has a Fast Forward service K<em>e</em> and K starts from this Interchange where J has a stop outside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>L starts from the same Interchange as K and terminates at an Interchange which two other services A and D ply too...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M is a cross territorial service that duplicates K for a very long distance. It faces high loading during school terms...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>N and O are from the same Interchange. N loops at an MRT Stn and the Interchange near that station has service Q. N duplicates K and M for a few stops along a certain road. N also has high loadings during school term. O loops at a Terminal which B, G, and K ply to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P is a service renowned for its extremely high loading and frequencies. This service duplicates D for a few stops along a few roads. It provides a quick link from the Central district to the North-west of Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q is a cross territorial trunk service from East to West. High loadings as it passes by numerous schools. It is also a WAB service. This service passes through the CBD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R is a service which goes to a very "ulu" part of Singapore. It only meets P for a few stops. However it has high loadings during Friday and Sunday nights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>___________________</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A, C, E and I terminate at the same Interchange.</p>
              <p>B, F and J terminate at the same Interchange.</p>
              <p>B, G, K, and O terminate at the same Terminal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A and E branches out from the Interchange in the same way but A goes straight while E turns right. C and I branch out from the Interchange in the same direction but do not meet at bus stops as C turns left while I goes straight. C and E meet along a nearby Town from that Interchange. However C takes a much more direct(and thus faster) routing than E. There will be a bus stop X near a NKF/KDF place whereby A, C, and E meet. After that bus stop C will go straight, while A and E turn left. Before this bus stop however, C and E meet each other for 3 bus stops(in each direction). A, C, E, and this time with I will meet yet again for a few bus stops. This time, E will turn left, while A, C and I will go straight. It is worthy to note that C, after turning left at bus stop X, continues down this road till the other end. And A will meet C for the last time along a road which A would not meet up with C again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>D and R meet each other for a few stops in the CBD. D would turn left and meet A and both would terminate at the same Terminal. R would turn right and continue its journey down to its terminating point in the North-western region.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It can also be said that D and Q meet and diverge from each other for a few times. Both are from the same Interchange. D and Q come out from the Interchange in the same direction, diverge after a condo, meet after a school and diverge after another school. They then meet again along a road which is very famous due to an incident. They diverge for the last time after a stop along this also famous building/s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>F is a service that only meets services E and G in one direction for only one bus stop. After this it turns right to continue on its journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I is a service that duplicates 59 for many bus stops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>J, as said earlier, has good yields.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A, K, L, and M meet up at a bus stop on a road along an expressway. That is the only time all four services meet up together. M also stops along bus stops on a road along another expressway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>R only meets up with one service, P. It then proceeds to west of this Town, and after passing through it, will come back again. It will stop outside and opp this famous mall in the Northwestern region.</p>
