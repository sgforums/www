              <p>D is a service that starts out with C.</p>
              <p>Both of them intercepts each other for many bus stops from the start till they hit O, a medical institution, where they branch out on their own.</p>
              <p>However, D will intercept with C for 2 another bus stops again before going on and terminating at the same interchange as B, interchange P.</p>
              <p>E is a service that serves the west with the far west, adopting a jump bus system and only intercepting with F and G.</p>
              <p>F is a WAB service. F's majority control has a full ADD fleet on Weekdays. Road N is the only road where F, G, H and I will meet altogether.</p>
              <p>G is the only service that ends at interchange Q with buses from depot R and the other services A-L except G do not terminate At Q.</p>
              <p>H is a service that has renowned crossovers, it also intercepts I on three different roads, S, T and U. H is known to intercept many of the services from A-L. Both ending points of H is not shared with any other service A-L.</p>
              <p>I is a service that meets with all services A-L except E.</p>
              <p>J is a service in which the direction of its route is somewhat like H. Ending point V of service J is non-boarding and alighting.</p>
              <p>K has the same ending point as J for one end and with G and I for the other. It passes by service J's ending point, V, too. K will intercepts F for 1 stop on 1 direction and 3 stops for the other at this area.</p>
              <p>L is a loop service that intercepts K at Road W that doubledecker cannot ply through. It intercepts H, I and J for 1 stop at its looping point.</p>

              <p>A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K are distinct trunk services.</p>
              <p>A and B serve the same two int/ter. Both are on the EWL. Including the two ends, they meet at the same road(s) for five stretches and intersect once. A is not 137</p>
              <p>C and D meet each other when C is three stops from the int, for one stop only. C is a loop service and both of them use an expressway.</p>
              <p>E enters the expressway westbound at the same place as D and exits with C. C and E are the only two svcs at the first stop after the express sector. E will make a 180 degree turn to another road while C goes straight and meets with F after merging with other services. A, B and F all serve the same int/ter in the west. Interestingly, they meet at a bus stop a few stops away but all three use different routes with B having the longest route of the three.</p>
              <p>D,G,H,I,J all serve a road that connects to a road that connects to a road that connects to a cargo area. When I enters that road, it will turn off and only return a few stops after on that same road. F,G and J meet at an NEL station. H is a loop service that enters a restricted area and uses the same int as C. G and J will follow each other, first on three main roads, then two expressways and another road before splitting up and then rejoining at the abovementioned NEL station. J will continue to a shopping mall with a number.</p>
              <p>K and F meet twice, but both times they are in opposite directions. K serves a secondary school that one of the forum members goes to, and it passes a roundabout.</p>
              <p>what are the 11 services?</p>

              <p>I just made up a quiz. See if you can find out the answer. There is only one answer for all of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A,B,C,D,E,F and Q are services run by SBS Transit or SMRT. They are all different. A, B, C and D all meet in a terminal, not interchange, in the CBD. A meets C twice on the East-West Line, and C passes Downtown East. E, however, doesn't go ANYWHERE near the rest, very far away. It carries a demostrator. D heads to one end of Singapore, also carrying a demostrator. B passes one of F's terminals, which is also where Q terminates. B and Q terminate at the same place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HINTS: F has a demostrator. A and E are not by SBS Transit. Q is 80.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This quiz is extremely hard. Even Jayh couldn't solve it. </p>

              <p>I just made up a quiz. See if you can find out the answer. There is only one answer for all of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A,B,C,D,E,F and Q are services run by SBS Transit or SMRT Buses. They are all different. A, B, C and D all meet in a terminal, not interchange, in the CBD. A meets C twice on the East-West Line, and C passes Downtown East. E, however, doesn't go ANYWHERE near the rest, very far away. It carries a demostrator. D heads to one end of Singapore, also carrying a demostrator. B passes one of F's terminals, which is also where Q terminates. B and Q terminate at the same place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HINTS: F has a demostrator. A and E are not by SBS Transit. Q is 80.</p>
              <p>This quiz is extremely hard. Even Jayh couldn't solve it. </p>

              <p>Your E is very vague. All the following fit the criteria. TIB905Y's 941, SMB1H's 172, TIB838H's 172, TIB1024H's 913.</p>

              <p>A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K are distinct trunk services.</p>
              <p>A and B serve the same two int/ter. Both are on the EWL. Including the two ends, they meet at the same road(s) for five stretches and intersect once. A is not 137</p>
              <p>C and D meet each other when C is three stops from the int, for one stop only. C is a loop service and both of them use an expressway.</p>
              <p>E enters the expressway westbound at the same place as D and exits with C. C and E are the only two svcs at the first stop after the express sector. E will make a 180 degree turn to another road while C goes straight and meets with F after merging with other services. A, B and F all serve the same int/ter in the west. Interestingly, they meet at a bus stop a few stops away but all three use different routes with B having the longest route of the three.</p>
              <p>D,G,H,I,J all serve a road that connects to a road that connects to a road that connects to a cargo area. When I enters that road, it will turn off and only return a few stops after on that same road. F,G and J meet at an NEL station. H is a loop service that enters a restricted area and uses the same int as C. G and J will follow each other, first on three main roads, then two expressways and another road before splitting up and then rejoining at the abovementioned NEL station. J will continue to a shopping mall with a number.</p>
              <p>K and F meet twice, but both times they are in opposite directions. K serves a secondary school that one of the forum members goes to, and it passes a roundabout.</p>
              <p>what are the 11 services?</p>
