              <p>This answer is specific to SBST's KUB, not in general.</p>
              <p><strong>Easy Access</strong>. The KUB is a wheelchair accessible bus, the first single-deck in Singapore to do so. It has zero-step entrance and exit, making it easy for the eldery and passengers with other needs to board and alight from the bus more easily. An auto-kneeling function also allows the bus to lower itself when at stationary. The WAB function though has not been fully utilised, as not all routes by SBST are certified to be WAB yet.</p>
              <p><strong>Environmental Friendly.</strong> While not as much as SMRT's OC500LE, the KUB features 6-speed ZF transmission and consumes less fuel than buses of the previous generation. It meets the stringent emission standards of Euro IV as set out by the LTA, and in the later batch, surpassed it with the Euro EEV. Plug doors also save on the air-conditioning, which translates to less energy consumption.</p>
              <p><strong>Enhanced features.</strong> This time round, ABS is standard equipment on all KUBs. Seat-belt is located at center rear seat, though it is hardly utilised. It could do better though, such as seat-belts on PIW area as SMRT has done so. CCTV is also now standard, though installation is still ongoing. EDS makes for an easier job for drivers as it makes for placement of plastic signs to be obsolote, the first model to do so after Dennis Trident.</p>
