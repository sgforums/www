              <p>Mind boggling Trivia</p>
              <p>A is a loop service that makes a U turn at Road M.</p>
              <p>A intercepts B at every bus stop along Road M that B plies on.</p>
              <p>C is a service that intercepts B at two different points for 2 stops.</p>
              <p>D is a service that starts out with C.</p>
              <p>Both of them intercepts each other for many bus stops from the start till they hit O, a medical institution, where they branch out on their own.</p>
              <p>However, D will intercept with C for 2 another bus stops again before going on and terminating at the same interchange as B, interchange P.</p>
              <p>E is a service that serves the west with the far west, adopting a jump bus system and only intercepting with F and G.</p>
              <p>F is a WAB service. F's majority control has a full ADD fleet on Weekdays. Road N is the only road where F, G, H and I will meet altogether.</p>
              <p>G is the only service that ends at interchange Q with buses from depot R and the other services A-L except G do not terminate At Q.</p>
              <p>H is a service that has renowned crossovers, it also intercepts I on three different roads, S, T and U. H is known to intercept many of the services from A-L. Both ending points of H is not shared with any other service A-L.</p>
              <p>I is a service that meets with all services A-L except E.</p>
              <p>J is a service in which the direction of its route is somewhat like H. Ending point V of service J is non-boarding and alighting.</p>
              <p>K has the same ending point as J for one end and with G and I for the other. It passes by service J's ending point, V, too. K will intercepts F for 1 stop on 1 direction and 3 stops for the other at this area.</p>
              <p>L is a loop service that intercepts K at Road W that doubledecker cannot ply through. It intercepts H, I and J for 1 stop at its looping point.</p>
              <p>Find Services A-L, Roads M, N, S, T, U, W. Medical Insitution O, Interchange P, Q, Depot R, Ending Point V.</p>

              <p>Both of them intercepts each other for many bus stops from the start till they hit O, a medical institution, where they branch out on their own.</p>
              <p>However, D will intercept with C for 2 another bus stops again before going on and terminating at the same interchange as B, interchange P.</p>
              <p>E is a service that serves the west with the far west, adopting a jump bus system and only intercepting with F and G.</p>
              <p>F is a WAB service. F's majority control has a full ADD fleet on Weekdays. Road N is the only road where F, G, H and I will meet altogether.</p>

              <p>J is a service in which the direction of its route is somewhat like H. Ending point V of service J is non-boarding and alighting.</p>
              <p>K has the same ending point as J for one end and with G and I for the other. It passes by service J's ending point, V, too. K will intercepts F for 1 stop on 1 direction and 3 stops for the other at this area.</p>
              <p>L is a loop service that intercepts K at Road W that doubledecker cannot ply through. It intercepts H, I and J for 1 stop at its looping point.</p>

              <p><br>61 meets 12 at Bugis and at Outram Park<br>If F 163, then B is very odd.</p>
              <p>Your question sounds like B F and 80 meet at Sengkang/HarbourFront, while B and 80 terminate at the same place, though you didnt say if the terminating pt is repeated twice. In addition B goes to New Bridge Rd terminal. How is that possible?</p>
