              <p>I don't think so leh... Coz M is 3. And BusSpeeder says that 3 does not intersect any of the services there. And one of the services you mentioned must be terminating at CV Ter. 109, 59 intersects 3 somehow or another... Unless Sv. 2 is the CBD New Bridge Road Ter one...</p>

              <p>yes E is 981. E doesn't intersect any of the 17 bus services, nor does it terminate at any interchanges/terminals that any of the 17 bus services terminates at. E cannot be 902 because R is 963 and would mean E would terminate at the same place as R.</p>
