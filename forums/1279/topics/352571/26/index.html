              <p><br>well, i didn't said that everybody should do mine first and i agreed to what you said, so that means that i will wait. so what's with this arrogant comment?</p>
              <p>and yours is already answered, so here's mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W are 11 bus services.</p>
              <p>M and Q terminates at a terminal in the central/northeast region of Singapore. When Q starts its journey at that temrinal, it will pass by a Junior College, MRT Station , MRT Depot and a bus interchange. Then, it will turn into a road and duplicate M in the opposite direction although they start from the same terminal.</p>
              <p>Before reaching that particular road, M duplicates N and P for a bus stop along a road. Then, they will be seperated and eventually, they will meet each other again at a road.<br><br>The bus interchange that Q will pass by is the terminating point for N, P and U.<br><br>M will pass by another MRT Station after duplicating N and P for a bus stop and Q in the opposite direciton. V will also pass by that MRT Station, which means it will also duplicate M.<br><br>The MRT Station that M and V passes by is very near to a bus interchange. <span style="color: #ff0000;">That bus interchange is the terminating point for</span> O, <span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S.<br></span><br>When O ,<span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S starts its journey at bus interchange</span>, O and S will duplicate each other while R will go in another direction and duplicate M in the opposite direction. After duplicating for a few bus stops, S will turn left and R will turn right. S will duplicate M and V. R will duplicate M and V in the other direction and eventually meet with M(opposite direction) and Q(same direction) at road.

              <p><br> well, i didn't said that everybody should do mine first and i
              agreed to what you said, so that means that i will wait. so what's
              with this arrogant comment?</p>
              <p>and yours is already answered, so here's mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W are 11 bus services.</p>
              <p>M and Q terminates at a terminal in the central/northeast
              region of Singapore. When Q starts its journey at that
              temrinal, it will pass by a Junior College, MRT Station , MRT
              Depot and a bus interchange. Then, it will turn into a
              road and duplicate M in the opposite direction although they
              start from the same terminal.</p>
              <p>Before reaching that particular road, M duplicates N and P
              for a bus stop along a road. Then, they will be seperated and
              eventually, they will meet each other again at a road.<br> <br> The bus interchange that Q will pass by is the terminating
              point for N, P and U.<br> <br> M will pass by another MRT Station after duplicating N and P for a
              bus stop and Q in the opposite direciton. V will also
              pass by that MRT Station, which means it will also duplicate
              M.<br> <br> The MRT Station that M and V passes by is very near
              to a bus interchange. <span style="color: #ff0000;">That bus
              interchange is the terminating point for</span> O, <span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S.<br></span><br> When O ,<span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S starts its journey at

              will go in another direction and duplicate M in the opposite
              direction. After duplicating for a few bus stops, S will
              turn left and R will turn right. S will duplicate M and V. R will
              duplicate M and V in the other direction and eventually meet with
              M(opposite direction) and Q(same direction) at road.
              Then, it will duplicate Q for another few bus stops and eventually
              duplicate with V.</p>
              <p>R and W has the same terminating point.  </p>
              <p>After passing by the MRT Station, M and V will meet S. M and S
              will then turn left and V will turn right and eventually duplicate
              with O.<br> <br> W starts its journey at Hougang Interchange.<br> <br> T duplicates S for a bus stop in the opposite direction. T will
              turn right and meet M. Then. it will turn off and will eventually
              reach its terminating point. Outside the terminating point, there
              is a bus stop. R and U stops by there. Previously, V terminated at
              this bus interchange before getting extended to another bus

              <p><br>well, i didn't said that everybody should do mine first and i agreed to what you said, so that means that i will wait. so what's with this arrogant comment?</p>
              <p>and yours is already answered, so here's mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W are 11 bus services.</p>
              <p>M and Q terminates at a terminal in the central/northeast region of Singapore. When Q starts its journey at that temrinal, it will pass by a Junior College, MRT Station , MRT Depot and a bus interchange. Then, it will turn into a road and duplicate M in the opposite direction although they start from the same terminal.</p>
              <p>Before reaching that particular road, M duplicates N and P for a bus stop along a road. Then, they will be seperated and eventually, they will meet each other again at a road.<br><br>The bus interchange that Q will pass by is the terminating point for N, P and U.<br><br>M will pass by another MRT Station after duplicating N and P for a bus stop and Q in the opposite direciton. V will also pass by that MRT Station, which means it will also duplicate M.<br><br>The MRT Station that M and V passes by is very near to a bus interchange. <span style="color: #ff0000;">That bus interchange is the terminating point for</span> O, <span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S.<br></span><br>When O ,<span style="color: #ff0000;">R and S starts its journey at bus interchange</span>, O and S will duplicate each other while R will go in another direction and duplicate M in the opposite direction. After duplicating for a few bus stops, S will turn left and R will turn right. S will duplicate M and V. R will duplicate M and V in the other direction and eventually meet with M(opposite direction) and Q(same direction) at road. Then, it will duplicate Q for another few bus stops and eventually duplicate with V.</p>
              <p>R and W has the same terminating point.  </p>
              <p>After passing by the MRT Station, M and V will meet S. M and S will then turn left and V will turn right and eventually duplicate with O.<br><br>W starts its journey at Hougang Interchange.<br><br>T duplicates S for a bus stop in the opposite direction. T will turn right and meet M. Then. it will turn off and will eventually reach its terminating point. Outside the terminating point, there is a bus stop. R and U stops by there. Previously, V terminated at this bus interchange before getting extended to another bus interchange. Outside the bus interchange V terminated at, there is a bus stop. W stops by that bus stop.<br><br>U will not duplicate W but their routes are quite close to each other.</p>
              <p>R will meet S in the opposite direction after 10~20 fare stages from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bus interchange</span>.</p>
              <p>Find M-W. If you can find the bus interchanges/terminal, MRT depot, MRT stations and JC, good for you.<br><br>Hi-lighted in red are infos that are linked</p>

              <p>Some hints : <br><br>P is a 3-digit service. <br>All of the services pass by the central/northeast region of Singapore.</p>
