            <div class='col-md body'><p>The skills to driving a bus can be taught within a period of time but having a positive attitude is cultivated over longer periods of time. It all boils down to the character of the BC. I did encounter all those bad habits u mentioned over the years of bus commuting and it is inevitable that we will meet those type of drivers mentioned. As much as we desire to have a good commuting experience, sometimes it's hard to attain that ideality. </p></div>

              <p>Targeting the bad BCs will not solve the problem.</p>
              <p>This problem exist in all sectors of the economy i.e. all categories of workers in Singapore. This is due primarily to the education level of the workers. By education I mean academic and life sciences.</p>
              <p>A better educated workforce will generally mean a more professional worker.</p>
              <p>Why do you think the the BC drives with an earpiece? He is not aware of the implications. He would certainly have been told to be mindful of safety and to be alert. But it just do not register.</p>
              <p>The subjects of our education syllabus do not make a better person. That where all the problems regarding service standards originates. </p>

              <p>Targeting the bad BCs will not solve the problem.</p>
              <p>This problem exist in all sectors of the economy i.e. all categories of workers in Singapore. This is due primarily to the education level of the workers. By education I mean academic and life sciences.</p>
              <p>A better educated workforce will generally mean a more professional worker.</p>
              <p>Why do you think the the BC drives with an earpiece? He is not aware of the implications. He would certainly have been told to be mindful of safety and to be alert. But it just do not register.</p>
              <p>The subjects of our education syllabus do not make a better person. That where all the problems regarding service standards originates. </p>

              <p>I feel when it comes to social responsibility and behaviour, everyone plays an important role. As much as the education syllabus itself do not make a better person, having some education in school helps because teachers of today dun just pass on hardcore knowledge to the students, but also focus a lot on the character development of the students. This will go a long way when the student leaves school for work next time.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, in the context of BCs, the current batch feature lots of foreigners from China and M'sia. Most of them are into their primes as well. As for how well they are educated, that's not of utmost concern but perhaps they should be taught about the dos and don'ts in their job. Make it simple for them to understand so that they learn faster and adopt the good practices on the roads.</p>
              <p>As for the future local BCs, we know they are the products of a more streamlined education system laid up during their younger days and a better standard of living; hence we should be able to expect their level of proficiency, in areas of ethics and technical knowledge, to move a notch upwards.</p>
