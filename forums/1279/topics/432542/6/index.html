              <p>I still don't get the logic behind the deployment of DDs on 163. The DDs can be put to better use on services like 74, 147 etc which have seen too many SDs in recent years relative to their respective loadings (very high and quite high).</p>
              <p>Similarly 151 doesnt need the DDs if it can improve on its frequency...the same problem, with the same second-best solution. Perhaps there are logistical constraints involved that causes SBST to try to solve loading problems by fixing the symptoms rather than the root causes...or there are too few SDs to go around.</p>
              <p>In 151's case, they might want to look into the deployment timings. No point deploying a DD from Hougang Int at 7+am (no people), and then reaching 8+am at Bukit Timah (still no people due to down-route)...or deploying the DDs in the afternoons. The only time DDs do make sense is evening from Kent Ridge.</p>
              <p>In 163's case, no scenario I know of requires ANY DD.</p>

              <p>In Sv163's case, probably revenue did not justify increasing its fleet, and the double decker is sufficient just for that critical timing when many are alighting &amp; boarding at ST Electronics. BCs are harder to get these days, and running single-deck buses at higher frequency is becoming a challenge. Deploying just one split-shift DD on Sv163 is the best method I can think of.</p>
              <p>For Sv74 &amp; Sv151, the single deckers are probably regular shift buses sandwiched between double deckers. I know some might ask that the DD depart a few minutes later than regular headways to pick up the load, but the end result is usually increased dwell time at bus stops after a longer wait for passengers, and bunching with the SD behind.</p>

              <p>151 was once full SD fleet. SDs were good enough.</p>
              <p>And when they made the changes, in 151's case, it made little impact except giving the chance to put my bag on the adjacent sit and sleeping with the knowledge that its unlikely that people would want to sit next to me plenty of times.</p>
              <p>In 74's case, towards AMK from Hougang, the SD doesnt even need to reach Serangoon North to quit picking up pax, and as for Bukit Timah folks....., you had better prayed it was a DD that arrives at most 15min after the previous bus because it would be impossible to board even the DD otherwise.</p>
              <p>Nope. I still stand by my stand that 151 and 163 are examples of services that do not need DDs...while services like 74 languish. And 74 needs newer DDs....74 has been bypassed for fleet upgrade very often, which is curious since 74 ihas been really bringing in loads of dough for SBS for a very long time. Only recently did the VO2X go....only to be replaced by SDs. The VO3X...especially the batch 1's tend to stink and climbing the slopes at full load sounds extremely strenous to the ears. Small wonder 74's VO3X fleet has a relatively higher incidence of breakdowns.</p>

              <p>deploying DDs on 151 was a mistake.. <br>and it used to be a black sheep service,, ,80% fleet used mk2 WA NAC at a time..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>deploying them on 151A at 4pm is even worse.. think theres more mosquitoes than passengers..<br>and makes me think.. why isnt 151A scrapped yet?<br><br><br>74 frequency is also deteriorating.. been a long time i seen a 5min freq.. and the SDs isnt too popular<br>most 74 buses are old.. BCs are also bad tempered..<br>cant help la.. all these school buses... low revenue + high vandalism rate...cant blame SBS for deploying the matured buses on this long route</p>

              <p>I believe 151A can still be used for 151e's S shifts.</p>
              <p>But I believe they've been fearing the heavy demand NUS - Clementi Rd cannot cope?</p>
              <p>Double decks wise, the 80% 10 mins QoS for peak hr dun work for PM peak. Not only it's because run time is longer, the demand pattern is pretty diff.</p>
              <p>Might as well use ADD &amp; maintain 12 mins freq. Say for Sv 35, is there a need for 10 mins if we can go at 13 mins w/ ADDs?</p>

                  <p>actually for sv151, the DD's are always on the wrong side nowadays i feel. maybe it's the schedule. there is a critical half-hour period where people cannot board as early as YIH, RH and NUS High. it should still be there, just that the rest of the journey is coping fine. packed but people can still have space to board.</p>
                  <p>sv74 is an example of a service that is frequent enough during peak-within-peak hour that single deck buses can cope, if not another bus will be arriving within minutes. VO2x were replaced by single deck buses because a capacity of 100 on VO2x matches more closely to the capacity of 84 on the single deck. a fleet reduction might ensue if it were replaced by VO3x.</p>
                  <p>as for the AMK to s'goon north sector, you might wish to write in. i saw sv74 buses doing downroute from AMK MRT just for this issue.</p>
                  <p>in the future, we can expect to see more services getting SD conversion to DD on weekdays, and fleet upgrade will eventually come to sv74, maybe sooner than you will expect (:</p>
