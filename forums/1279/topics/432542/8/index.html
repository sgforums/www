              <p>If you're talking about the 1630 departure from Sengkang, arrival around 1730. I think its pretty okay frequency wise. This was observed about a week ago. About 8 minutes from front bus 969G. BC chionged all the way to TPY, upper deck about 10 people max only.</p>
              <p>But return trip to sengkang around 6 plus at ST electronics, confirm full pax all the way to the door. I think DD was called in for this reason.</p>

              <p>Actually i find there's something wrong with the timings for SBS9669M.</p>
              <p>The other time I took this bus from Sengkang Interchange.Â </p>
              <p>The bus came just less than 2 mins after the previous single deck 163 left the interchange.Â </p>
              <p>Ended up, this bus caught up with the single deck 163 at Fernvale Ave.Â </p>
              <p>After which, this 9669 began to drive damn damn damn slow such the distance between both buses became further and further.Â </p>
              <p>Not to mention, the whole double deck bus is almost empty, because most of the passengers boarded the single deck 163 just right in front.Â </p>
              <p>I thought this was just a 1 time incident so I didnt really take it to heart.Â </p>
              <p>The other day, I was waiting for a bus at a bus stop at Yio Chu Kang Road.</p>
              <p>I saw a single deck 163 at the opposite bus stop passing by</p>
              <p>less than 2 mins again, this same double deck came to the same bus stop.Â </p>
              <p>This time, this double deck is empty. (from what i see lah)</p>
              <p>So this gives rise to qns what's the objective of putting a double deck in 163 when the frequency is so short between this bus and the before in front and it does not really pick up any passengers?Â </p>
              <p>Hopefully the 2 incidents only happened once in a while.Â </p>
