No it doesnt<br>2. Yes but not to the extent of full passenger capacity.<br>3. No. If it does the frequency will be longer. SBST would rather deploy ADDs on other 'worthwhile' services.<br>4 and 5. I dont think especially at the Upp Aljunied Rd area.<br>6. No. And since its run by SBST it never will. 139 had LO 3x before.<br>7 and 8. I dont know.<br>9.  I dont think SBST will do that<br>10. Not really.. 231 also caters to student demand along its route.<br>11. is it? if that's the case it'll be withdrawn by the end of next year <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>12. I dont think TIBS will. Dont forget PTC's regulations of having FAC services in time to come. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>13. Maybe. I'm not sure about its demand up north. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>EDIT: I've replied the rest.</strong></div>
