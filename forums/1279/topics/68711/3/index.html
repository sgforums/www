Unless that bus has 2 shifts. If there are 2 shifts, i want the morning shift timesheet because i want the info of its crossover to 238 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Speaking of timesheets, service 26 revised its weekday timesheet WEF 9th Feb.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I may take the opp. But, bef the Open Hse last yr, it was still NAC even on Sat, Sun.<br><br>The matter is that of the e guide saying it is PAC. If it is PAC, there should be AC buses even during off peak daily, not just wkend. The problem has been for years already. So, anyway, the matter will be settled once SBS makes it NAC or put ASD during off peak. It is matter of promise, you say it is PAC, it should be PAC anytime of the day even if there is just 1 ASD.</div>
