              <p>Yeah....I still remember when the new-new Superbus appeared on 88.....I thought it was the one of the nicest thing I had ever seen.....the big <span style="color: #ff0000;">88 </span>desto and the Superbus logo on top. Man, I miss those days. In those days, the VO3X Batch III were really considered to be coolest DDs on the roads. And after putting up with BCs exasperatedly telling my mum they had not enough BCs to assign to 88 and were given NAC Scanias and 0405s, MKIV DMs, and new-new MKIV DM3500 (NO STRIDERS) and some MKIIIs, this was really god-send. </p>
              <p>Beginning days only the Batch III assigned...then Batch II progressively assigned.....ads then were very nice too. The Home United ad.....the Megan Classic ad....the Motorola ad etc etc. Soon after, LO3X entered the fleet. I don't recall 9614T being part of the fleet for the majority of the time, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't part of the fleet throughout the mid 2000s. Other Batch IIIs joined the growing DD fleet as well....like 9630, 9632, 9638, 9642.</p>
              <p>88 is still one of my favourite service....frequency is good, the buses maintained well, and its one of the faster trunk routes.</p>
              <p>Contrast that to 72 and you'll see why I stopped taking 72 after the mid 2000s. Poor night-time frequency, and slow driving simply makes my travel time longer than necessary. And for some reason, any bus that goes to 72 simply falls to pieces soon after.....I don't know why. Maybe cos Tampines Rd is a little dusty?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> My fave DD 9580J went to the dogs the moment it went to 72 from 88. </p>

              <p>Yeah....I still remember when the new-new Superbus appeared on
              88.....I thought it was the one of the nicest thing I had ever
              seen.....the big <span style="color: #ff0000;">88</span> desto and
              the Superbus logo on top. Man, I miss those days. In those days,
              the VO3X Batch III were really considered to be coolest DDs on the
              roads. And after putting up with BCs exasperatedly telling my mum
              they had not enough BCs to assign to 88 and were given NAC Scanias
              and 0405s, MKIV DMs, and new-new MKIV DM3500 (NO STRIDERS) and some
              MKIIIs, this was really god-send. </p>
              <p>Beginning days only the Batch III assigned...then Batch II
              progressively assigned.....ads then were very nice too. The Home
              United ad.....the Megan Classic ad....the Motorola ad etc etc. Soon
              after, LO3X entered the fleet. I don't recall 9614T being part of
              the fleet for the majority of the time, and I'm pretty sure it
              wasn't part of the fleet throughout the mid 2000s. Other Batch IIIs
              joined the growing DD fleet as well....like 9630, 9632, 9638,
              9642.</p>
              <p>88 is still one of my favourite service....frequency is good,
              the buses maintained well, and its one of the faster trunk
              routes.</p>
              <p>Contrast that to 72 and you'll see why I stopped taking 72 after
              the mid 2000s. Poor night-time frequency, and slow driving simply
              makes my travel time longer than necessary. And for some reason,
              any bus that goes to 72 simply falls to pieces soon after.....I
              don't know why. Maybe cos Tampines Rd is a little dusty?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> My fave DD 9580J went to the dogs the
              moment it went to 72 from 88. </p>

              <p>Once it went to 72..............the lock-up spoilt.....turning it into a squealing and roaring VO3X that barely moved.</p>

              <p>Really terrible is a terrible understatement.</p>

              <p>Its weekend frequency is also nonsense. And good luck to you if you had gone shopping till past dinner-time at Tampines and attempt to take 72 (I would take train to Pasir Ris and jalan-jalan at White Sands and take 88 instead...must be more productive!).</p>
