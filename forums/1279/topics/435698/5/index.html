              <p>In fact long distance travellers' travelling time and boarding
              chances are made erratic with the feedering legs.</p>
              <p>Say for Sv 30, say I'm waiting along Boon Lay Way I might not be
              able to board even if I'm heading to Pasir Panjang. For all we may
              know 80% alights inside Taman Jurong and the bus runs empty into
              Teban Gardens.</p>
              <p>Furthermore at the Int, you can't differentiate out the feeder
              and long distance commuter. Sekali that trip is entirely feedering
              passengers.</p>
              <p>Say for Sv 198, 6 mins freq would become irrelevant, as the
              actual freq is 9 mins to cater for the Jurong East demand.</p>
              <p>I'd taken 198, it takes 25 mins to get from Boon Lay into Jurong
              East. 25 mins could get me from Jurong East into NUS.</p>
                            </div>
                          </blockquote>So what do you suggest for Sv 30 and 198? operate as pure trunk services which is like straight out of boon lay to the next town bypassing jurong west/east ave 1 / taman jurong? Then people have to travel boon lay to take these 2 services then go to where they want. Or you want a parallel feeder and keep 30 and 198 route? If the parallel feeder option were to be taken, then the feeder can have 4-6min frequency, 198 at 12min frequency? <br>

              You differnetiate the fares like I've alrdy mentioned with feeding leg. Obviously you dun feel it because you dun use it. 
              
              That's why waiting for it is erratic, it has to cater for all sorts of passengers. Say I'm at Boon Lay Gdn, say I can't even board 2x 198 as it's too crowded though I'm heading beyond Jurong West. When 70% alights at Jurong West.
              
              That's the boarding chances improvement. Then why was there feeder svs for? 
              
              Sometimes I do see empty 198 heading to Bt Merah at 1945 at Jurong Town Hall n I believe freq is 9 - 12 mins.

              <p>161 has a lot of people boarding. True. But need so many buses?

              <p>that's why i one time noticed a gruop with TODDLER getting their faces slammed by the doors of 8702 on 147 in HG int. the BC didn't allow them to board even for the fact that they are oredi in front of the door liao, and drive off with less than FIVE people on board. what bitchy act. </p>
              <p>161 obviously need THAT much buses. but 74? that problem has to be solved as well. simple. deploy wrights lah! famous for old VO3x batch 1 anyway, 87 oso can get, why can't 74? when SBS register newer wrights can consider abt 74.</p>

              <p>Now, HK has the real problem(sorry must tell foreign stories again). i have always boarded tridents in HK b4, but alexander bodied. it was CHAOTIC. At one point, the WAB slots, the alleyways, the doors, the staircases, and even the TOP wasn't spared. i almost can't board the bus despite how i tried compressing my body. in the end the BC had no choice but to light up the"bus full"sign. that means that no one else will be allowed to board until the bus looks ok for boarding. and even that box-thingy(for the spare tyre i guess)above the left front wheel, between the two doors, had people SITTING on it. every spae was made use of. you can clearly see the bus doors being pushed out a little from the bus.</p>
              <p>then the alexander-bodied VSO. Same situation. but WORSE. Traffic jam lasted for an HOUR. you will never know how torturing it is. so be grateful that singapore still had that much people but more buses. or else...</p>

              <p>Well yeah. I also second that 88 is like sardine at Bishan and to a less extent....AMK, but only slightly. But 88 is also pretty consistent now unlike the mid 2000s, and its frequency is arguably acceptable for its loading. Around 10 min off-peak day, and 15 min off-peak night. 88 is also one of the trunk svcs where you are likely to see BCs speeding. Ok la. Improvement from last time. Even with the VO3X batch III new-new in 2000, loading was a huge problem and BCs had expressed exasperation driving on 88.</p>
              <p>147 at night is a pain to take. Frequency all over the place, and tend to be packed. Afternoon loading is sizeable. But trying to guess 147's general speed is like playing russian roulette. 50% fast, 50% slow.</p>
              <p>I still stand by my statement that 161 can do with 1 less DD...? Because now its frequency is really a little "too good". Gone were the days where I cursed and swore at the 30 min frequency, but replaced by the days where I cursed and swore at the 2-3 161s that arrive as I wait for 147/156. So perhaps emotions play a part in that.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>151 is plagued by its off-the-realities schedule. Case-in-point: Afternoon DD slots that I know of include leaving KRT at 1535 and 1635.......which are the quietest moments for NUS.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Having 151A and 151 leave unsynchronised is just as unhelpful, 151As have been seen bunched up completely empty with a fully-loaded 151 in the middle. And perhaps rather infuriating would be the down-routes......which would have been more helpful in solving loading problems at Bukit Timah if they were full-routes instead. And perhaps rather interestingly, VO3Xs have a tendency to be deployed by HGDEP only late at night for single trips for services like 151 and 163. Not quite sure why, but its definitely not with the crowd issue in mind.</p>
