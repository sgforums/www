              <p>Yeah....I still remember when the new-new Superbus appeared on
              88.....I thought it was the one of the nicest thing I had ever
              seen.....the big <span style="color: #ff0000;">88</span> desto and
              the Superbus logo on top. Man, I miss those days. In those days,
              the VO3X Batch III were really considered to be coolest DDs on the
              roads. And after putting up with BCs exasperatedly telling my mum
              they had not enough BCs to assign to 88 and were given NAC Scanias
              and 0405s, MKIV DMs, and new-new MKIV DM3500 (NO STRIDERS) and some
              MKIIIs, this was really god-send. </p>
              <p>Beginning days only the Batch III assigned...then Batch II
              progressively assigned.....ads then were very nice too. The Home
              United ad.....the Megan Classic ad....the Motorola ad etc etc. Soon
              after, LO3X entered the fleet. I don't recall 9614T being part of
              the fleet for the majority of the time, and I'm pretty sure it
              wasn't part of the fleet throughout the mid 2000s. Other Batch IIIs
              joined the growing DD fleet as well....like 9630, 9632, 9638,
              9642.</p>
              <p>88 is still one of my favourite service....frequency is good,
              the buses maintained well, and its one of the faster trunk
              routes.</p>
              <p>Contrast that to 72 and you'll see why I stopped taking 72 after
              the mid 2000s. Poor night-time frequency, and slow driving simply
              makes my travel time longer than necessary. And for some reason,
              any bus that goes to 72 simply falls to pieces soon after.....I
              don't know why. Maybe cos Tampines Rd is a little dusty?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> My fave DD 9580J went to the dogs the
              moment it went to 72 from 88. </p>

Have all citaros REMOVED from sv16 and put in ALL JB MKIIIs<br>2. upgrade 1st 2 buses of sv196e to DDs so that i would not get squashed<br>3. change sv36 fleet to partial Scanias[not Citaros] and MKIIIs<br>4. Remove the 4 Scanias from 147 n put one of them to 163 so that the 163 DD go to 147<br>5. CUT 113 fleet to 5 buses n improve freq for sv62 for OFF PEAK<br>6. 113 fleet to be downgraded to Scania batch 2 Euro IV to have more standing space so that there will be no more complaints/requests to upgrade 113 to DD fleet due to capacity issues.<br>That should be my wishlist...<br>Hope someone is listening...<br><br>ACx</p>

              <p>If your mum is really in wheelchair, my take is you wouldn't take the opportunity to demand for just Citaro as far as SD is concerned. Obviously there's an agenda. What's anything about KUB when they're the mass to provide WAB sv?</p>
              <p>As for new buses, what justice are you holding now? 34 use MKIII is upholding justice to justify that 36 must flatter tourist at all cost? Then 34 no need Citaro or whatever buses?</p>
              <p>The words is what your say one, but your alter it to make others look bad. Just like the feeder bus, anything but me until I dig if 913 does this and that. </p>
              <p>Just as ppl are bashing abt double standards, here we've people doing it as well. What's the point of flattering tourist when Citaro can't handle big peak hr load?</p>
