              <p>But if you ask me how practical the Citaro is for day-to-day rides, I think just about any SD in the SBST fleet seems more comfortable.</p>
              <p>The B10Ms also have narrow aisles like the Citaro, but far more seats and better aircon. And the B10M doesnt have the problem of hot rear.

              <p>At the moment if you ask me which is the most comfortable SD that would induce a nice 40 winks I would say: K230UB (the better maintained ones) without hesitation. I love its aircon and the leg-room.</p>

              If you don't like Citaro is fine, to call it rubbish , is totally out of order. You and SmB128 are irritants and the real garbages in this forum are you and him! Perfect match for each hour. I would rather take citaro over f lousy scania and make 3s day.
              
              Do the rest of us a favour! STFU of your constant bombasting of Citaro, because no one is interested to hear your whining !

              If you don't like Citaro is fine, to call it rubbish , is totally out of order. You and SmB128 are irritants and the real garbages in this forum are you and him! Perfect match for each hour. I would rather take citaro over f lousy scania and make 3s day.
              
              Do the rest of us a favour! STFU of your constant bombasting of Citaro, because no one is interested to hear your whining !

              <p>Nuff said.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it won't change many of our opinions that the Citaros are nice to look at but hardly nice in any other sense. For those who take long-haul bus rides like I do, the Citaro makes for a suffocating ride.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, they are just buses, as long as I can breathe, as long as the leg-room is good (if there's even a seat), as long as I dont have to resist the urge to scratch the insides of my ears, as long as my sleep is uninterrupted, any bus will do.</p>
              <p>Most excellent SD for sleeping is the K230UB, and as for DD, it will have to be the B10TL with its sleep-inducing constant radiator roar and nice suspension.</p>

              <p>fellow bus fans; why get so upset and even harbour hatred towards some buses and quarrel among ourselves? IMO, a true bus fan is one who simply loves buses and doesn't discriminate any of them. For me, I may be disappointed with some models but I still love them simply because they are still afterall buses! Isn't it the reason why we are all gathered here in this forum?</p>
              <p>By bearing unhappiness and hatred in your hearts only cause misery upon yourselves! Be gracious! And don't <em>"kan bu kai".</em></p>
