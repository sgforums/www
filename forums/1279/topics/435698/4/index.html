              <p>But it seems the pax boarding at Tampines is mainly short haul as in they will disperse along TP Ave 9 right? I doubt many will ride beyond Hougang and from Hougang Ave 9 onwards, it's occupancy is more or less like 58 on non peak, NYP rush hours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>My comment is more on reference to weekend ridership. Weekdays peak no need say. I also experience B9 with upstairs standees. </p>

              <p>Is it due to off peak fleet is only half its max no. at peak hours? Can they provide downroute or some 72A which operate in this format: YCK to HG Ave 3, turn about at Ave 7 there balik start at HG Ctrl Int. Cos the suay issue is the section between Hougang to Tampines Ave 10 is the ulu section like 174's Jurong Road and therefore on holistic view,  depot ain't willing to send so many out at off peak cos u have such a low demand sector (AMK ave 5 also quite lull at off peak) but ironically, this cross country "townlink" has established too critical links like HG ave 9 to HG mall, so it's headache ah</p>

              <p>Seriously they should go back to the old days of proper trunk - feeder concept though they're duplicating routes.</p>
              <p>Then impose penalty fares to shoo away those feeder commuters, priorities the boarding chances to the commuters who really need the bus.</p>
              <p>Say a feeder bus bet Boon Lay &amp; Jurong West St 42 to cushion 198's feedering load. Then 198's starting fare from BNL would be 81c (Into Jurong East) or +3.9km of distance fare for transferring commuters.</p>
              <p>Neither do you wish to have problem of 'too many choices' see any bus departs just board. </p>

              <p>but occationally i would be like you too. one of thm is when i go to arport and back to my sengkang home. sometimes, especialy when i came back from airport in the morning, i would take 86&lt;---&gt;858 becoz i knew i would get sardined on 27(there are less than 10 people on board 858) and the OCs are number one, as quie as air, number two, vibraton tone perfest and number three, the white colour is nice, which made my morning rides even more comfortable.</p>
              <p>But in majority, I take 27, probably becoz it has became a habit...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p><br>Unlikely</p>
              <p>In fact long distance travellers' travelling time and boarding chances are made erratic with the feedering legs.</p>
              <p>Say for Sv 30, say I'm waiting along Boon Lay Way I might not be able to board even if I'm heading to Pasir Panjang. For all we may know 80% alights inside Taman Jurong and the bus runs empty into Teban Gardens.</p>
              <p>Furthermore at the Int, you can't differentiate out the feeder and long distance commuter. Sekali that trip is entirely feedering passengers.</p>
              <p>Say for Sv 198, 6 mins freq would become irrelevant, as the actual freq is 9 mins to cater for the Jurong East demand.</p>
              <p>I'd taken 198, it takes 25 mins to get from Boon Lay into Jurong East. 25 mins could get me from Jurong East into NUS.</p>
