              <p>Charles, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, as in you and SMB128B but name calling is downright rude and totally uncalled for since both he/1 did not insult or name call you.<br>I condemn citaros coz i face them everyday on sv16, as i mentioned in this forum on other threads, i cant board the bus and have to wait for the next sv16 or the next till i can board.<br>If i can board, the so-called aircon in the bus is making me perspire?! so?! SBST's citaros are not modified for local conditions.<br>Unless you face this conditions daily, dun jump the game and start insulting, name calling everyone. <br>If you did read the earlier post with eyes open, the comparison was made with the reliable MK IIIs, the result was and is still RUBBISH.<br>Fyi, i have travelled to Europe countless times and have taken their CITAROs but i did not whine about them coz the local bus operators have done a good job of maintaining their buses so that it is comfortable to all passengers.<br><br>ACx</p>

              <p>Who cares abt more sitting? seats takes space. elderly gets seat happy? it's a matter of education for ppl to give up seats 2 elderly.</p>
              <p>i assume u don't frequently take 163 rite? so stop jumping to conclusions. KUB is STILL the best bus for 163, no matter what angle u look at it.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, which reminds me. Is 100% WAB fleet really the way to go?</p>
              <p>Take 147 for example, a K230UB or worse, a Citaro, is hardly suited for this route due to a disproportionately large number of elderly taking this service. </p>
              <p>Its fine for young folks like me to stand. But it would be hard on the elderly to expect the same. We need diversity in the bus requirements but LTA has set a blanket order which might not be the best solution.</p>
              <p>In the case of 147, this service needs full WAB DD fleet. Too many people, and plenty of PIWs and elderly taking this service. The occasional K230UB or B10M in its fleet like what I had today is not good enough. It might be fine for other services to have some SDs or non-WAB buses here and there (like 163) but as I have witnessed today, 147's SDs cannot handle the load. And there was PIW today again. If it had been a B10M, it would have been worse.</p>

              <p>Oh yes, which reminds me. Is 100% WAB fleet really the way to go?</p>
              <p>Take 147 for example, a K230UB or worse, a Citaro, is hardly suited for this route due to a disproportionately large number of elderly taking this service. </p>
              <p>Its fine for young folks like me to stand. But it would be hard on the elderly to expect the same. We need diversity in the bus requirements but LTA has set a blanket order which might not be the best solution.</p>
              <p>In the case of 147, this service needs full WAB DD fleet. Too many people, and plenty of PIWs and elderly taking this service. The occasional K230UB or B10M in its fleet like what I had today is not good enough. It might be fine for other services to have some SDs or non-WAB buses here and there (like 163) but as I have witnessed today, 147's SDs cannot handle the load. And there was PIW today again. If it had been a B10M, it would have been worse.</p>

              <p>good. u noe wat? replace B10M wif VSO. Problem solved.</p>
              <p>Wat i'm flamed at is not that 163 has B10Ms of course, I'M FLAMED AT THE FACT THAT 163 KEPT DOWNGRADED AND NOW ONLY LIKE HALF IS KUB WHEN 163'S RITERIA IS 70-80% !!!</p>

              <p>I can see why.</p>
              <p>Because despite living at Fernvale for 2 whole mths, I never saw a single PIW take 163. It made more sense to use the LRT.</p>
              <p>Beyond Sengkang, hardly anybody takes 163 except during peak hours from AMK Industrial Park. Even within Sengkang, a single B10M can pick everyone up. Please dont tell me everyone squeeze like sardines and stuff. I used to take 163 and compared to 74 where nobody gets to board only a few stops after HG Int at morning peak hour, 163 has it much better.</p>
              <p>SBST's deployments make sense. 147 has plenty of B9TLs, for the reasons I stated. 74 and 161 have plenty of VO3X due to high loading with a young demography.</p>
              <p>So obviously 163 gets all of that you are whining. In fact you should be thankful there's even 163 in Sengkang East because the LRT is a better alternative actually. </p>

              <p>i assume u don't frequently take 163 rite? so stop

              <p>u tell a SGrean to give up seat to elderly or person in need, see their reaction,<br>they will just act blur, look at all the reporting in newspaper of SGreans not giving up their seats to those in need or you do not read newspaper, or transport news at all<br>How many years of education have the local transport companies educate Sgreans to give up their seat and the result?! still status quo<br>If you actually think what you are writing, you would realise how silly your arguments are, an elderly would definitely want to seat and so does a normal Sgrean who paid for theor fare and wants to be seated.<br>Which of this SGrean trait do you not understand or you do not hold a pink IC in the 1st placeï¼Ÿï¼�<br>Please do not write as though you know sv163's boarding capacity for weekday, weekend from start to end of service coz i dun but i have knowledge of the loading capacity.<br>if you think Scania is the best for sv163, use your best command of English to DEMAND full scania fleet for sv163 then<br>Your insolence is pathetic...<br>If sv163's scheduled departure of 15-20 mins headway, do you think there still need DDs?!<br>Your comment of B10Ms to VSO shows your ignorance.<br>Just to educate you again , SBST fleet of B10M consists of MK IIIs, IVs, Striders, DM3500s not just MK IIIs.<br>If sv163 is downgraded as claimed by you, everyone will be taking Dennis Dart...lol<br>Doengrading of route is similar to how HK bus operators downgrade routes that have low capacity, and you still dare say you stay in HK for 6 years and claim you know it all...<br>As 2601D said, there are more HG DEP buses that need buses upgrade<br><br>ACx</p>

              <p>1) The fare system: It creates the need to implement short haul svs to provide competitive fares against other players i.e. light bus. Bus can be flooding the place during off peak hrs..</p>

              <p>But some things we can learn</p>
              <p>1) Semi express svs: One thing tat's +ve, but imagine trying to convert some med or long dist rts into semi express and create bus - bus overnight?</p>
              <p>2) Special early morning svs: For us, it can also mean providing such svs to Jurong. Of course one issue is where to throw the buses to after their special trips.</p>
              <p>That said, HK's bus ridership problem might be attributed to the following issues.</p>
              <p>1) MTR expansion: I believe when TKO &amp; MOS rail opened, KMB's business took a drastic hit. It killed off a lot of demand on the remaining Shatin - CBD svs.</p>
              <p>2) Route rationalisation: I believe the bus companies are facing a lot of problem whenever they try to amend bus routes.</p>
