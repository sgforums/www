              Seriously?! hmmm if i ve the Senior management email wic i would like to have, i can write...
              Hmmm must be buddy buddy with Mark Chua liao so that i can ask him to write in for me to:
              1. Have all citaros REMOVED from sv16 and put in ALL JB MKIIIs
              2. upgrade 1st 2 buses of sv196e to DDs so that i would not get squashed
              3. change sv36 fleet to partial Scanias[not Citaros] and MKIIIs
              4. Remove the 4 Scanias from 147 n put one of them to 163 so that the 163 DD go to 147
              5. CUT 113 fleet to 5 buses n improve freq for sv62 for OFF PEAK
              6. 113 fleet to be downgraded to Scania batch 2 Euro IV to have more standing space so that there will be no more complaints/requests to upgrade 113 to DD fleet due to capacity issues.
              That should be my wishlist...
              Hope someone is listening...

              do you know how many people are taking 113? 113 with 7 buses frequency already very cui. 5 buses , cant imagine.
              and btw, what do you mean by cutting fleet and there'll be no complaints? it should be adding more buses so that there will be no complaints..
              and btw, if you are not a frequent commuter of 113, dont suggest fleet cut. It is essential for people living in lorong ah soo area.

              <p>Kids. I dun wish to feed the trolls, but there's some facts that has to be mentioned.</p>
              <p>1) JB MKIII are due for retirement. like it or not, Citaro are the replacement buses. They've to appear somewhere.</p>
              <p>3) Airport Svs uses KUBs for a reason. As again, MKIII are due for retirement.</p>
              <p>4) 147 can still live with KUBs, in fact most of the time they're well dispatched to the slightly lower demand trips.</p>
              <p>5 &amp; 6) KUBs and typical SD's licensed capacity is abt 80. No difference. Simi squeeze more people?</p>
              <p>I'd rather SBS dispatch more buses to Svs like 72, 74</p>

              <p>They're not considered Island Svs, they're cross harbour svs. Who on earth would want to spend HK$20 to travel within Islands?</p>
