            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from CNA.<br><br>During last Sunday's mock terror attacks on MRT stations, transport companies provided shuttle services to ferry passengers affected by the disruption.<br><br>But transport operators say that in a real emergency, the buses may not be deployed so quickly, if at all.<br><br>SBS Transit, which runs the North East MRT Line, says a single bomb blast will warrant the shutdown of the entire train network.<br><br>SBS Transit's rail operations director, Alex Goei, said: "What has been agreed with the authorities is that we would close down the system and this is to prevent any further attacks and further injuries and deaths to commuters. Following which we would do a security sweep of all the stations.
