Driving is actually quite a boring and repetitive activity. Even more so if you drive a feeder service. In the case of Sv. 410, in one shift the driver sees the same place 12 times, every 40 minutes! So he will be damn bored and tired and will try to keep awake any way he can!</div>

Along Punggol Rd towards Punggol Rd End after TPE, i was sitting in front of Superbus at the upper floor. It stopped over for a while and i was puzzled so i went downstairs. The bus captain was puffing a smoke outside but when he saw me coming down, he *speechless* dropped his cigrattee down! He thought there were nobody in his Superbus! Hahaha laughing....<br><br>Another interesting incident?....hmm, i better not say here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
