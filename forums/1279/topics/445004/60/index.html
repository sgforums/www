              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I apologise for the previous posts I had made in SGForums last
                  Friday via this thread and the Suspected Redeployments thread,
                  which have led to the unhappiness of fellow forum members surfing
                  this forum on that same day. Therefore, I would like to take this
                  opportunity tonight to apologise to fellow forum members which I
                  had brought about any inconvenience to. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I am also apologetic
                  towards creating a clone account, SMB229T, out of anger</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I would also like to take this opportunity to
                  lay out my future plans for redeployment posting. I know I did
                  promised to stop posting redeployments in 2011 and again this
                  Friday, as mentioned by SGF user SBS8032G. Therefore, I would like
                  to make my final stand now: I will only post redeployments of SBS
                  Transit buses except from BNDEP from now if I spot the perm stix in
                  the bus. I will also post redeployments that are updated in SGWiki
                  but are not posted here to clarify whether it is true. I will
                  <strong>NOT</strong> touch SMRT bus deployments any longer, as per
                  recommended by SGF user TIB783G.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I would like to make special apologies to the following
                  SGF users:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>SBS 9631 X:</strong> I would like to apologise to you
                  for defaming you by saying that you can confirm all SBS Transit bus
                  deployments in "Suspected Redeployments" thread.</li>
              <li><strong>TIB783G:</strong> I would like to apologise to you for
                  defaming you by saying that you can confirm all SMRT bus
                  deployments in "Suspected Redeployments" thread and not heeding
                  your advice, but instead going a step further by creating a clone
                  account.</li>
              <li><strong>Gus. chong:</strong> I would like to apologise to you
                  for bringing about inconvenience to you by creating a clone account
                  here to create trouble.</li>
              <li><strong>SBS8032G:</strong> I would like to apologise to you for
                  breaking my promise that I will not post redeployments in this
                  thread from 20 December 2011, but continuing to post redeployments
                  from 21 December 2011. However, I would like to assure you that I
                  have made a new promise as explained in the second paragraph of
                  this post.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I will continue to post advertisement updates, cameos and
                  transport rides taken from now in the respective
                  threads. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>

              <p><br>So if he tells u,u will just believe it like a dog la??This alr clearly proves that u dont have a brain for yourself to use.Like this its very easy to cheat u one sia.Worse than a kid sia u.Ppl just tell u,then u immediately must come here and just post it like that ah without any confirmation or what??And it seems like u dont have eyes of your own as well.So what if he tells u??U can choose not to believe him and can w8 patiently until u spot the bus with your bloody own eyes if u have one then u can post it here rite.Like i said in my earlier post,u will get a jackpot/strike lottery if u post so much of redeployments here isit??U think that ppl will think that u r very smart if u post so much redployments here.But like i said earlier,if at least 1/2 of what u post is correct then nvm.But 3/4 of what u post is all absolute bullshit and false info.<br><br>And the worst part of it all is that u didnt even post 1st about who gave u the info that 631L went to TRG,but when TIB1051D proved your post wrong,u quickly jumped on the bandwagon and immediately pointed your finger at user SMB116K.So your bloody filthy mindset is if the redeployment turns out to be right,u will totally forget the person who gave u the info 1st and is to get the credit for yourself for posting the redeployment.But when that redeployment turns out to be horribly wrong,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">u immediately blame and sabotage the person for giving u the info.</span></strong>What kind of horrible mentality is this man??Even a kid wont behave as terribly as u.Kena caught only want to start pointing fingers and squealing out the names of everybody.So childish and disgusting.And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dont ever be so quick to blame the others when u r caught red handed la.Blame yourself for being such a stupid dumbass 1st.</span></strong></p>

              <p>i am quite sure that these 2 Wrights are perm because i saw it on the same slot for past few days, and since the debut of Wrights perm, others also spotted these 2 buses on 78. only this week onwards, i change my daily perm bus from SBS3061E (boarded from Clementi) to SBS3064Y (boarded from Jurong East), partly because i wanna see if these 2 Wrights are consistent on 78, and so far it proven to be true... at the same time, i saw SBS9397Y parking at Jurong East without fail this week.</p>
              <p>btw, i am a daily commuter of bus 78 cos my workplace is located at Penjuru area where it is only accessible by bus 78. thats why i can be pretty certain of the perm status.</p>

              <p><br> So if he tells u,u will just believe it like a dog la??This alr
              clearly proves that u dont have a brain for yourself to use.Like
              this its very easy to cheat u one sia.Worse than a kid sia u.Ppl
              just tell u,then u immediately must come here and just post it like
              that ah without any confirmation or what??And it seems like u dont
              have eyes of your own as well.So what if he tells u??U can choose
              not to believe him and can w8 patiently until u spot the bus with
              your bloody own eyes if u have one then u can post it here
              rite.Like i said in my earlier post,u will get a jackpot/strike
              lottery if u post so much of redeployments here isit??U think that
              ppl will think that u r very smart if u post so much redployments
              here.But like i said earlier,if at least 1/2 of what u post is
              correct then nvm.But 3/4 of what u post is all absolute bullshit
              and false info.<br> <br> And the worst part of it all is that u didnt even post 1st about
              who gave u the info that 631L went to TRG,but when TIB1051D proved
              your post wrong,u quickly jumped on the bandwagon and immediately
              pointed your finger at user SMB116K.So your bloody filthy mindset
              is if the redeployment turns out to be right,u will totally forget
              the person who gave u the info 1st and is to get the credit for
              yourself for posting the redeployment.But when that redeployment
              turns out to be horribly wrong,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">u immediately blame and sabotage the
              person for giving u the info.</span></strong>What kind of horrible
              mentality is this man??Even a kid wont behave as terribly as u.Kena
              caught only want to start pointing fingers and squealing out the
              names of everybody.So childish and disgusting.And
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dont ever be so
              quick to blame the others when u r caught red handed la.Blame
              yourself for being such a stupid dumbass 1st.</span></strong></p>
