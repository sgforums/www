              <p>Neway,Heard info Smrt will have a mass redeployment of buses and
              services in year end.Cant confirm though so don't shoot me.</p>
              <p>171 will be fully Amdep</p>
              <p>852 Kranji takes over from Woodlands.</p>
              <p>858 probably 3 duties to Amdep</p>
              <p>167 &amp; 857 full Amdep</p>
              <p>980 Amdep reduce 4 duties to Wldep</p>
              <p>169 Amdep reduce 5 duties to Wldep</p>
              <p>67 Amdep reduce 6 duties to Kjdep</p>
              <p>Bt Panjang service will be divided between the new Wld bus parks
              and Kjdep.</p>
              <p>882 handed over to Wldep.</p>
              <p>Probably a new short haul or express service from Sbw.</p>
              <p>961 Amdep reduce 5 duties to Wldep and 969 Amdep reduce 4 duties
              to Wldep.</p>
              <p>Marina Ctr service will be partial Amdep excluding 77.</p>
              <p>Heard there's plan for 77 to loop at Suntec.</p>
              <p>106 will be fully Kjdep and probably 190 back to minority
              Amdep.</p>

              <p>Whether or not they want to change the grouping really depends on the driver grouping  itself. For 852 if most out of the 16 drivers live in SE or near SE do you think they will go down to KJDEP and take their bus? Doesn't make sense right? If 171 were to go full AMDEP, Does it make sense for the 171 driver who lives in BPJ drives their bike all the way to AMDEP? If there is anything indeed to do with handing over of controls for different services, They would have to consider the welfare of the drivers.</p>

              <p>Ok fine I respect that. But if they want to change hands they will have alot to consider on. Not just the travelling time etc. I personally don't think they will shift around. It wastes time and they will have 'find a place that is agreeable' to change.</p>
              <p>To be honest, Depot changing is really tiring because you can't get all the drivers to agree on a same location to change their shift. Especially if some of them live very very far like AMK, Bishan etc.</p>

              <p>Yes. That is in the past. But now standards has changed. You can't expect the drivers of the past to agree to the changes of the present. Likewise the drivers of the present can't agree with the changes of the past. Yes I respect your view that KJ is nearer for 852 but times has changed. There are alot of things do consider on when it comes to 'changing hands' to a service.</p>
              <p>The 'KJ is nearer' theory doesn't work in this era. The depot who gave away 852 to WL in 2008 must have thought for a very long time before they hand 852 over.</p>

              <p>Yes. That is in the past. But now standards has changed. You
              can't expect the drivers of the past to agree to the changes of the
              present. Likewise the drivers of the present can't agree with the
              changes of the past. Yes I respect your view that KJ is nearer for
              852 but times has changed. There are alot of things do consider on
              when it comes to 'changing hands' to a service.</p>
              <p>The 'KJ is nearer' theory doesn't work in this era. The depot
              who gave away 852 to WL in 2008 must have thought for a very long
              time before they hand 852 over.</p>

              <p>Depot change doesn't concern much about drivers.Co will tell u whether u wanna follow that service or find another service that's all.Its more of depot space availability the feasible off service routes and infrastructure.If wanna follow drivers welfare then we would see 16 Ar/Bn 7 Bb/Bn 161 full Am as its much nearer to both side.You know what's d distance from Hgdep to Woodlands??Need I say more?</p>

              <p>It is rather unusual for 167 to go full AMDEP whereas 169 and 980 goes majority WLDEP.
