              <p>Don't compare me to SMB228X please. In what ways are my post ridiculous and chilldish? If everyone were to be like that they will have to check my posting records and as a result making troubles. So let's say if I'm telling you that your posts are ridiculous and childish and should I check your posting records like that?</p>
              <p><strong>Like someone here said, everyone had a chance to gain extra posts. Can't I do that as well just to express my feelings after receiving bad remarks (for example) from someone and thus resulting in everyone started taking advantage of my disadvantages, doing things that were hurting the whole forums (like creating clone accounts)? Just like what I'm posting is also a part of my feelings. Is no posting what I'm (or even the members of the forums) supposed to be doing in the first place?</strong></p>
              <p>Those people who were involved in connection with such a matter should really think again. I hope this message that passes around will make some people who don't understand something here to understand it.</p>

Frankly speaking, I feel a major difference between me and SMB228X cos personally I don't like him (this should goes to the same of most of the members here as well.) There's one sentence I'd heard before from someone in Chinese: 'è¯´è¯�ä¸�é•¿çœ¼ç�›', which means the one who talks did not understand who he is talking to. Not really that I want to say it, but they did not even understand who the opponent is (like mistaking identities) even before talking nonsense to that person who don't know what he is talking. By understanding this logic, I hope I could save much talking space and I hope this goes to the same as the others as well.</p>
