              <p>I don't take public transport which includes my company transport and never thought that it's a long term solution to commuting in Singapore because I do not like to be dictated on the time I travel. Most of my colleagues drive and we all enjoy it. I enjoy every moment in my G5-GT. My boss drives a 520i and he strictly prefers not to go public. My brethren in office drives his 147 and even though known for being delicate, he still prefers it. I have another colleague who used to drive a F355 and a vintage W124 have never considered taking the bus. Also another colleague who'd rather wait for her husband to come by in his S40 rather than to take the public transport. This is because if you can afford, why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ERP and maintenance costs to me is within the my financial boundaries. Petrol prices is within tolerance. All you need is better management. We have a government who can vacuum very well so no choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in exchange, I get unlimited movement. I am not bonded by location, distance nor timings. I can meet up my friend in our usual haunt in dempsey hill Ben&amp;Jerry in 30mins and still make it within reasonable means. I can go anywhere I want in the night, organize road trips to Penang and enjoy the drive up. Boy... driving in a convoy is very fun actually. You need to experience it before you can know it. When possible, I will go to the race track and enjoy speeding and cornering. I don't drink frequently. Even if I do, I will take a cab or there's a designated driver in our group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In regards to traffic jams, if I am jamed with a car, I will also get the same jams in the bus and worse still, stuck in a more slow moving vehicle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My car accelerates rather quickly, so the only thing I need to worry about is accidents and TP when I drive which is a compromise I am prepared to make. I have never a single day regretted going from public to personal transport. And I dread the moment I need to use the public transport even though I can survive with that too. If I feel like it, I will keep my car at home and ride my motorcycle instead. Never will I need to resort to public transport. It is only used as a final resort to travel but never should it be a priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, not everyone will enjoy sitting behind the wheel or the handlebar. Let everyone who has found his preferred mode of transport enjoy every single minute. Do not let inferiority complex be a reason why you should feel ashamed of taking the public transport for it is your money, your choice.</p>

              <p>A little OT but I wonder why the TS did not consider the option of 965 &gt; NEL (SKG - HBF) &gt; 61/93/100/963. I live in the North and this has proven that I can reach HBF in less than an hour, even inclusive of waiting times on few occasions.</p>

              <p>I did think of it before but after trying out a few other different options beforehand I had no more bandwidth to try new ways - was getting late to work too often and if the 965-NEL-61/93/100/963 way played me out I would be in more hot soup. Anyway I found a method which was efficient and would probably be the most efficient and i stuck to it - take 851/852/853 to Yio Chu Kang MRT bus stop and take service 573 direct to Alexandra road. Definitely less than 45 minutes because that 573 driver somehow always manages to negotiate the CTE jam very very efficiently. And I got to sit all the way!</p>
