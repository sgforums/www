              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there are pros and cons of taking buses and driving cars. Well, taking buses can be a bane if u are stuck in the bus-stop waiting for like over 20 minutes just to expect a fully packed bus and wait for another bus in no less than 15 minutes. Imagine experiencing that a few times during weekday morning rush can be very fustrating.</p>
              <p>Hence, people might consider driving instead. But, with the ERP charges in the morning and jams along expressways, alongside with high petrol charges and the fustration of finding a cheap parking lot along town, sometimes taking a bus might save a whole deal of money.</p>
              <p>So it depends on which occasion we are in to determine which mode of public transport suits us well. There is no perfect mode of transport. I suggest, for those who have cars, to plan their journey and check for any road blocks or diversions for their destinations in advance. If such situation arises, taking public transport will certainly save time and money.</p>

              <p>Yes I tried that many times before, but it is the least effective option.</p>
              <p>1. 855 waiting time is 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>2. 855 no seats by the time reach my bus stop (2nd bus stop after bus interchange), stand for one hour plus plus.</p>
              <p>3. Upp Thomson Road can get bad jams, 100% jam at Thomson Plaza area, and at Macritchie Viaduct.</p>
              <p>4. Farrer Road to Queensway prone to jams.</p>
              <p>5. 51, 93, 61 and 100 waiting time is about 15 minutes. These services all bunch together. When they come, they all come together, it is never a (15 divide by 4) mins wait.</p>
              <p>So by this way I can leave home at 7:30am and still be late for work at 9:30am and kena scolding from boss.</p>

              <p>Yes I tried that many times before, but it is the least effective option.</p>
              <p>1. 855 waiting time is 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>2. 855 no seats by the time reach my bus stop (2nd bus stop after bus interchange), stand for one hour plus plus.</p>
              <p>3. Upp Thomson Road can get bad jams, 100% jam at Thomson Plaza area, and at Macritchie Viaduct.</p>
              <p>4. Farrer Road to Queensway prone to jams.</p>
              <p>5. 51, 93, 61 and 100 waiting time is about 15 minutes. These services all bunch together. When they come, they all come together, it is never a (15 divide by 4) mins wait.</p>
              <p>So by this way I can leave home at 7:30am and still be late for work at 9:30am and kena scolding from boss.</p>

              she was already spitting at the bus stop while waiting for the bus)
              , then she sit on the Right side green seat , the 2 seat face each
              other one , throughout the journey she kept making the sound and
              kept spitting directly on the floor . barbaric ! , about 10 over
              times , by the time the bus reach bnl , there was a pile of phyleym

              <p>I don't take public transport which includes my company transport and never thought that it's a long term solution to commuting in Singapore because I do not like to be dictated on the time I travel. Most of my colleagues drive and we all enjoy it. I enjoy every moment in my G5-GT. My boss drives a 520i and he strictly prefers not to go public. My brethren in office drives his 147 and even though known for being delicate, he still prefers it. I have another colleague who used to drive a F355 and a vintage W124 have never considered taking the bus. Also another colleague who'd rather wait for her husband to come by in his S40 rather than to take the public transport. This is because if you can afford, why not?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ERP and maintenance costs to me is within the my financial boundaries. Petrol prices is within tolerance. All you need is better management. We have a government who can vacuum very well so no choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in exchange, I get unlimited movement. I am not bonded by location, distance nor timings. I can meet up my friend in our usual haunt in dempsey hill Ben&amp;Jerry in 30mins and still make it within reasonable means. I can go anywhere I want in the night, organize road trips to Penang and enjoy the drive up. Boy... driving in a convoy is very fun actually. You need to experience it before you can know it. When possible, I will go to the race track and enjoy speeding and cornering. I don't drink frequently. Even if I do, I will take a cab or there's a designated driver in our group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In regards to traffic jams, if I am jamed with a car, I will also get the same jams in the bus and worse still, stuck in a more slow moving vehicle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My car accelerates rather quickly, so the only thing I need to worry about is accidents and TP when I drive which is a compromise I am prepared to make. I have never a single day regretted going from public to personal transport. And I dread the moment I need to use the public transport even though I can survive with that too. If I feel like it, I will keep my car at home and ride my motorcycle instead. Never will I need to resort to public transport. It is only used as a final resort to travel but never should it be a priority.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course, not everyone will enjoy sitting behind the wheel or the handlebar. Let everyone who has found his preferred mode of transport enjoy every single minute. Do not let inferiority complex be a reason why you should feel ashamed of taking the public transport for it is your money, your choice.</p>
