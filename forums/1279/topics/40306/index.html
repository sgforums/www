            <div class='col-md body'>Hey pple. For this topic, we will look back to some services that have been integrated, withdrawn or introduced.<br><br>Backdated to 1993, Serangoon Bus Interchange has Svc 72 n Svc 312. If I am not wrong, Svc 312 travelled from S'goon Bus Interchange n looped at S'goon Ave 3. If I am not wrong, it was withdrawn at the middle of the yr 1993. Svc 72 was withdrawn at 1992, if I am not wrong. It served b/w Serangoon Int and Tanhong Rhu (loop). It was taken over by Svc 158. Svc 104 (S'goon - New Bridge Rd) was withdrawn by then.<br><br>On Yr 1998, Svc 72 was extended from its existing route (YCK to AMK Ave 5) to YCK to Tampines.<br><br>On 12/12/1999, Service 864, 865, and 866 were renumbered. Svc 864 was integrated with Svc 84 and renumbered as Svc 80. 865 and 866 were renumbered  as 85 and 86 respectively.<br><br>Any more additions? Juz add them in! =)<br></div>

It plys one-way from Bukit Merah to the airport in the morning peak and return one-way in the evening peak.

Svc 16E was renumbered svc 36 in Dec 1997. In Sep 1998, SBST amended the route of svc 36 to become the present route.<br></div>
