Also, the NiteOwl broshures are only left with 65M and 174M.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The guess is correct, 16M, 89M, 162M &amp; 181M didn't operate on the Good Friday holiday on 18 April. I think that SBST didn't withdrawn these services, SBST only make them operate on Christmas Day, New Year &amp; Chinese New Year. So, let us wait for the early morning of 25 December to see if SBST is telling the truth of them operating as festive seasons services.<br></div>

If service 1 terminates at Changi Village, does it follows the exact route of service 2 to Somapah? (If this is the case, then there's a long duplication of route)<br></div>
