The official address, the street directories all indicate that the buildings Panasonic and Fujitec are in Bedok South Ave 1. But the bus stops located just outside the compounds cannot possibly be in Bedok South Ave 1, insist the detractors Superbus and Tranquilice.<br><br>So I guess if one steps into those buildings, one is in Bedok South Ave 1, and if one steps out of the building, one is in Bedok South only. There must be an invisible demarcation separating Bedok South Ave 1 and Bedok South, and Fujitec and Panasonic are built on it. That appears to be the only logical explanation.<br><br>I cannot think of any alternative that is logical to say about the Lions Home located in Bedok South Ave. 2. According to Superbus, even though the address is Bedok South Ave 2, and SBST229 calls at the stop outside the Lions Home, SBST229 still does NOT go to Bedok South Ave 2. Instead, SBST229 only goes to the Lions Home, nevermind what the address is. Very logical.<br><br>So if anyone wishes to take a taxi/bus to the Lions Home, avoid telling the driver it is located at Bedok South Ave 2, despite that being its official address in the street directory. What is one to say then? Gawd knows, but if you wish not to piss off Superbus, you know what NOT to say.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

So please do take note of the limitations here.</div></blockquote>I really *do* dread confrontations. Your examples are valid- but they follow an old line of argument which I addressed earlier on 29 June at 9:11am. (You may wish to check that post.) This was what I said:<br><br>"Road/building names in Singapore often do not make any immediate sense to the onlooker for various (historical)reasons. Hence Holland Road is nowhere near/in the Netherlands, Tampines Home is in Thomson Road *and* West Coast Road, but not Tampines Road..and so on. "<br><br>Another contribution from Iveco on the same day pointed out more road name disparities:<br><br>"Tampines Rd links TAM/PSR with HGN via PLAB rear entrance. Jurong Rd used to extend up to Bt Timah. Woodlands Rd stretches from the Causeway down to BPJ area. Part of AMK Ave 3 belongs to S'goon town. Only a small portion of these roads belong to the area they are named after."<br><br>If you wish to ignore the official address of those buildings, or the street directory, or the fact that these places are close enough to Bedok Central that they fit on the same page of the map.....so be it. In this instance, it is not one of those 'is Changi Road necessarily in Changi' type of situation.<br><br>As for the "detractor" bit, I am not sure why it is offensive to you. It is not a bad word or a 4-letter crudity. (Perhaps you may wish to check the lexical meaning in a dictionary.) It is like addressing someone who teaches for a living, a 'Teacher', and then accused of name-calling and hateful. Huh? Where is the sense in that?<br><br>I was merely being factual by stating you detract the value of this "discussion". What sort of discussion can there be, if you unilaterally say your piece for the first time, conclude that it is the final word on the matter, and then take away the right of reply by attempting to 'close' it there and then?<br><br>By this, you imply that other people's opinions have little value, are worthless, and not worth reading. Hence, there is no point in 'discussing' it anymore- only 'case closed'.<br><br>So now you see why 'detractor' is appropriate in this context....and in any context, hardly a crude word. It is barely in the same league as other more colourful names I can think of.<br><br>But I digress really, and only wish to stick to bus related subjects.<br><br>Call this contentious stretch Bedok South (or Upper East Coast as Tranquilice says) or Ang Mo Kio Ave 17 or Pungol East Gardens.... whatever pleases you. My bottomline is that I used the same road name the street directory indicated. If you insist Fujitec and Panasonic are not on Bedok South Ave 1, despite all official indications, you will be pleased that I have taken note. Can't guarantee if the rest of Singapore agrees though.<br><br>With that, I conclude my opinion on this matter, and will henceforth hold my peace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
