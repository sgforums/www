              <li>1. 80km/h(Effecient??? Burn more fuel, higher fuel costs.)</li>
              <li>Speeding way above 60km/h. If get into an accident, high death and injuries rates.  Also very prone to overheating burnt bus. And I don't see them going above 65km/h most of the times, where they are already struggling on 65 to 70 km/h.</li>
              <li>As if like other buses cannot reach above 80km/h... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Just that they install speed limiters. Always going above 60km/h already broke the traffic law, by right vehicle should be impounded. </li>
              <p> </p>
              <li>2. Better acceleration(So as not to hold up buses behind)</li>
              <p>Better acceleration my foot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Many of them are struggling just to keep that kind of crazy accleration just to meet the tight schedules. That why so many of them are run down now, hard to maintain. Wrights, Citaros and O405s have even better and smoother acceleration than bendies. In fact, the bendies here are seriously overstrained just to keep in schedule. They are just not suitable for our operational needs. Many buses can have good acceleration, just that they are strictly enforced with speed limiters.</p>
              <li>3. No height constraints</li>
              <p>Not many routes have height constraints in Singapore and they can easily repaced by single deckers with good frequencies. At least more frequent buses than lousy frequencies just to fill up that bendy yet waste so much space on bus stops.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <li>4. Elderly-friendly</li>
              <p>Not all elderly likes to move all the way to the rear, most will prefer to sit in the front part.</p>
              <li>5. Useful on feeders</li>
              <p>A myth. Seriously double deckers can do the same job as well. From what I observed on 291 last week, people are also willingly to move uo as well, even it is just a feeder service. Goes the same for Bedok and Boon Lay feeders. It just takes time for people to adjust.</p>
              <li>6. Higher capacity if commuters move to the rear</li>
              <p>Problem is people don't like to move in the rear, BCs have to shout at people to move back. Same case of the double decker of telling people to move up. At least double decker is the lesser evil of the 2 which takes up much less space along the bus stop and do not delay other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">And it only takes less than 10 people more than a double decker yet take up so much road space. Somemore frequencies are improved and more bus services to ease loads, no need high capacity bendies that hog the roads. So use double deckers better.</p>
              <li>7. Faster boarding and alighting(So as to vacate the bus stop as quickly as possible)</li>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faster alighting, yes since it has a 3rd door. But if double deckers have 3rd doors as well, isn't it the same??? But double deckers are better with smaller road space it takes up.</p>
              <p>And how much faster it is??? At most 1 to 2 mins but delay other buses behind by up to 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Faster boarding definate a no. 8 mins to fill a double decker is better than 8 mins to fill a bendy because bendy blocks the path of other buses behind, while double decker don't block the path of other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>8. Takes up a lot of road space, in bus stops, bus interchanges, bus depots causing jams and queues and make the overall bus operations disruptive, messy and hard to organise. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png">Also costly because need more land space and bus companies have to buy more expensive land just to park more of such long buses. These money can be saved for more profits.</p>
              <p>9. Overheats easily. Yes and that is why so many are burnt down. Very disruptive to bus company because of their short of buses which are burnt down.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>10. Bad at reverse turns, sharp turns and 3-point turns, may jacknife(no prob with u turns) U-turns, and sharp bends sometimes can mount kerbs, especially dangerous for standees.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>11. High accident rates. Speeding, long bodies and higher chances in contact with other vehicles, swaying trailers on wet roads and rainy days. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>12. Cut into many lanes when overtaking or turning right. Delay other buses and vehicles benind. Worst is in a CBD jam, waste a lot of road space when it cuts off many lanes.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>13. Articulator is more complex to maintain and more costly to maintain as well, due to electronics and complex structures. Articulator rubber walls gets easily dirty and hard to clean and maintain. Hard to maintain overall as well. Look at how SMRT maintains most of them. They only be better during once in a blue moon refurnishments. SMRT can't be bother with them anyway.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>14. Not suitable for smaller bus interchanges and depots for the future. Somemore these buses will only make things worse when the government wants to add more buses for better frequencies and more bus services. Imagine all bendies, how long will the queues be and how much delays it can give. Totally not in line with what the LTA wants for efficient bus transport. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> In future, the population will be big, but our land space is so small. Of course, moving up is the better choice. Just like high rise HDB flats vs terranced houses.</p>
              <p>15. Many services, even with good frequencies, need high passengers loadings but yet cannot be deployed bacause limitations of parking spaces for limited number of bendies in depots and interchanges. These services loadings can be greatly improved if SMRT uses double deckers. This problem will be even worse when our population increases in future. SMRT should tackle this increasing loading problem using standard 12 m high capacity buses now or else in the future, their operations can't keep up with the increasing loadings but smaller interchanges and depots with fewer buses avaliable. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> They should ditch bendies.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>1. 80km/h(Effecient??? Burn more fuel, higher fuel costs.)</li>
              <li>Speeding way above 60km/h. If get into an accident, high death
                  and injuries rates.  Also very prone to overheating burnt bus.
                  And I don't see them going above 65km/h most of the times, where
                  they are already struggling on 65 to 70 km/h.</li>
              <li>As if like other buses cannot reach above 80km/h... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Just that they install speed limiters.
                  Always going above 60km/h already broke the traffic law, by right
                  vehicle should be impounded. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>2. Better acceleration(So as not to hold up buses behind)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Better acceleration my foot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Many of them are struggling just to
                  keep that kind of crazy accleration just to meet the tight
                  schedules. That why so many of them are run down now, hard to
                  maintain. Wrights, Citaros and O405s have even better and
                  smoother acceleration than bendies. In fact, the bendies here are
                  seriously overstrained just to keep in schedule. They are just not
                  suitable for our operational needs. Many buses can have good
                  acceleration, just that they are strictly enforced with speed
                  limiters.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>3. No height constraints</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not many routes have height constraints in Singapore and they
                  can easily repaced by single deckers with good frequencies. At
                  least more frequent buses than lousy frequencies just to fill up
                  that bendy yet waste so much space on bus stops.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <ul>
              <li>4. Elderly-friendly</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not all elderly likes to move all the way to the rear, most will
                  prefer to sit in the front part.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>5. Useful on feeders</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A myth. Seriously double deckers can do the same job as well.
                  From what I observed on 291 last week, people are also willingly to
                  move uo as well, even it is just a feeder service. Goes the same
                  for Bedok and Boon Lay feeders. It just takes time for people to
                  adjust.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>6. Higher capacity if commuters move to the rear</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Problem is people don't like to move in the rear, BCs have to
                  shout at people to move back. Same case of the double decker of
                  telling people to move up. At least double decker is the lesser
                  evil of the 2 which takes up much less space along the bus stop and
                  do not delay other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">And it only takes less than 10 people more than a
                  double decker yet take up so much road space. Somemore frequencies
                  are improved and more bus services to ease loads, no need high
                  capacity bendies that hog the roads. So use double deckers
                  better.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>7. Faster boarding and alighting(So as to vacate the bus stop
                  as quickly as possible)</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faster alighting, yes since it has a 3rd door. But if double
                  deckers have 3rd doors as well, isn't it the same??? But double
                  deckers are better with smaller road space it takes up.</p>
              <p>And how much faster it is??? At most 1 to 2 mins but delay other
                  buses behind by up to 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Faster boarding definate a no. 8 mins to fill a double decker is
                  better than 8 mins to fill a bendy because bendy blocks the path of
                  other buses behind, while double decker don't block the path of
                  other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>8. Takes up a lot of road space, in bus stops, bus interchanges,
                  bus depots causing jams and queues and make the overall bus
                  operations disruptive, messy and hard to organise. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png">Also costly because need more land space and
                  bus companies have to buy more expensive land just to park more of
                  such long buses. These money can be saved for more profits.</p>
              <p>9. Overheats easily. Yes and that is why so many are burnt down.
                  Very disruptive to bus company because of their short of buses
                  which are burnt down.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>10. Bad at reverse turns, sharp turns and 3-point turns, may
                  jacknife(no prob with u turns) U-turns, and sharp bends sometimes
                  can mount kerbs, especially dangerous for standees.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>11. High accident rates. Speeding, long bodies and higher
                  chances in contact with other vehicles, swaying trailers on wet
                  roads and rainy days. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>12. Cut into many lanes when overtaking or turning right. Delay
                  other buses and vehicles benind. Worst is in a CBD jam, waste a lot
                  of road space when it cuts off many lanes.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>13. Articulator is more complex to maintain and more costly to
                  maintain as well, due to electronics and complex structures.
                  Articulator rubber walls gets easily dirty and hard to clean and
                  maintain. Hard to maintain overall as well. Look at how SMRT
                  maintains most of them. They only be better during once in a blue
                  moon refurnishments. SMRT can't be bother with them
                  anyway.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>14. Not suitable for smaller bus interchanges and depots for the
                  future. Somemore these buses will only make things worse when the
                  government wants to add more buses for better frequencies and more
                  bus services. Imagine all bendies, how long will the queues be and
                  how much delays it can give. Totally not in line with what the LTA
                  wants for efficient bus transport. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> In future, the population will be big,
                  but our land space is so small. Of course, moving up is the better
                  choice. Just like high rise HDB flats vs terranced houses.</p>
              <p>15. Many services, even with good frequencies, need high
                  passengers loadings but yet cannot be deployed bacause limitations
                  of parking spaces for limited number of bendies in depots and
                  interchanges. These services loadings can be greatly improved if
                  SMRT uses double deckers. This problem will be even worse when our
                  population increases in future. SMRT should tackle this
                  increasing loading problem using standard 12 m high capacity
                  buses now or else in the future, their operations can't keep up
                  with the increasing loadings but smaller interchanges and depots
                  with fewer buses avaliable. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> They should ditch bendies.</p>

              <p>Well my friend.. <strong>I am not against bendies</strong>, but just want to point out that in your advantages <strong>only point 3 is valid</strong>: height restrictions.</p>
              <p>1,2,7 - makes no difference. Take a bendy on 854 and a DD on 25. They follow the same route for some 15kms. You will notice when one follows the other, there is no difference in time between the two type of buses. If you get off the bendy, you will see the 25 DD right behind and vice versa. It is a MYTH that bendies are faster.</p>
              <p>4 - why is DD bus not friendly for elders??? It does have a lower deck :)</p>
              <p>6 - DDs have higher capacity than bendy buses. On a 854 after 110 pax, no one can enter the Habit, on 25 DD - pax go upto 125 pax.</p>
              <p>5 - Useful on feeders. Another myth. See how well utilized the DDs are on 222, 291, 334. Anyway, I don't think you have gone to Woodlands to see the mess the number of bendies make at the interchange.</p>
              <p>Bendies should continue to operate on routes such as 67, 180, 960, 969 and feeder routes under SMRT but long-haul CBD routes, city routes and intra town routes should be operated using DDs.</p>
              <p>Buy 100 bendies, 300 DDs - should be good.</p>

              <p>The feeling of cruising along TPE without the engine on is like a motored speedboat moving with the waves without the engine on... Best ride ever!!! Although the bus was damn shaky then...</p>
