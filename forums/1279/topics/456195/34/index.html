              <ul>
              <li>1. 80km/h(Effecient??? Burn more fuel, higher fuel costs.)</li>
              <li>Speeding way above 60km/h. If get into an accident, high death
              and injuries rates.  Also very prone to overheating burnt bus.
              And I don't see them going above 65km/h most of the times, where
              they are already struggling on 65 to 70 km/h.</li>
              <li>As if like other buses cannot reach above 80km/h... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Just that they install speed limiters.
              Always going above 60km/h already broke the traffic law, by right
              vehicle should be impounded. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>2. Better acceleration(So as not to hold up buses behind)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Better acceleration my foot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Many of them are struggling just to
              keep that kind of crazy accleration just to meet the tight
              schedules. That why so many of them are run down now, hard to
              maintain. Wrights, Citaros and O405s have even better and
              smoother acceleration than bendies. In fact, the bendies here are
              seriously overstrained just to keep in schedule. They are just not
              suitable for our operational needs. Many buses can have good
              acceleration, just that they are strictly enforced with speed
              limiters.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>3. No height constraints</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not many routes have height constraints in Singapore and they
              can easily repaced by single deckers with good frequencies. At
              least more frequent buses than lousy frequencies just to fill up
              that bendy yet waste so much space on bus stops.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <ul>
              <li>4. Elderly-friendly</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Not all elderly likes to move all the way to the rear, most will
              prefer to sit in the front part.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>5. Useful on feeders</li>
              </ul>
              <p>A myth. Seriously double deckers can do the same job as well.
              From what I observed on 291 last week, people are also willingly to
              move uo as well, even it is just a feeder service. Goes the same
              for Bedok and Boon Lay feeders. It just takes time for people to
              adjust.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>6. Higher capacity if commuters move to the rear</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Problem is people don't like to move in the rear, BCs have to
              shout at people to move back. Same case of the double decker of
              telling people to move up. At least double decker is the lesser
              evil of the 2 which takes up much less space along the bus stop and
              do not delay other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png">And it only takes less than 10 people more than a
              double decker yet take up so much road space. Somemore frequencies
              are improved and more bus services to ease loads, no need high
              capacity bendies that hog the roads. So use double deckers
              better.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>7. Faster boarding and alighting(So as to vacate the bus stop
              as quickly as possible)</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Faster alighting, yes since it has a 3rd door. But if double
              deckers have 3rd doors as well, isn't it the same??? But double
              deckers are better with smaller road space it takes up.</p>
              <p>And how much faster it is??? At most 1 to 2 mins but delay other
              buses behind by up to 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Faster boarding definate a no. 8 mins to fill a double decker is
              better than 8 mins to fill a bendy because bendy blocks the path of
              other buses behind, while double decker don't block the path of
              other buses behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>8. Takes up a lot of road space, in bus stops, bus interchanges,
              bus depots causing jams and queues and make the overall bus
              operations disruptive, messy and hard to organise. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png">Also costly because need more land space and
              bus companies have to buy more expensive land just to park more of
              such long buses. These money can be saved for more profits.</p>
              <p>9. Overheats easily. Yes and that is why so many are burnt down.
              Very disruptive to bus company because of their short of buses
              which are burnt down.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>10. Bad at reverse turns, sharp turns and 3-point turns, may
              jacknife(no prob with u turns) U-turns, and sharp bends sometimes
              can mount kerbs, especially dangerous for standees.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>11. High accident rates. Speeding, long bodies and higher
              chances in contact with other vehicles, swaying trailers on wet
              roads and rainy days. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>12. Cut into many lanes when overtaking or turning right. Delay
              other buses and vehicles benind. Worst is in a CBD jam, waste a lot
              of road space when it cuts off many lanes.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>13. Articulator is more complex to maintain and more costly to
              maintain as well, due to electronics and complex structures.
              Articulator rubber walls gets easily dirty and hard to clean and
              maintain. Hard to maintain overall as well. Look at how SMRT
              maintains most of them. They only be better during once in a blue
              moon refurnishments. SMRT can't be bother with them
              anyway.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>14. Not suitable for smaller bus interchanges and depots for the
              future. Somemore these buses will only make things worse when the
              government wants to add more buses for better frequencies and more
              bus services. Imagine all bendies, how long will the queues be and
              how much delays it can give. Totally not in line with what the LTA
              wants for efficient bus transport. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> In future, the population will be big,
              but our land space is so small. Of course, moving up is the better
              choice. Just like high rise HDB flats vs terranced houses.</p>
              <p>15. Many services, even with good frequencies, need high
              passengers loadings but yet cannot be deployed bacause limitations
              of parking spaces for limited number of bendies in depots and
              interchanges. These services loadings can be greatly improved if
              SMRT uses double deckers. This problem will be even worse when our
              population increases in future. SMRT should tackle this
              increasing loading problem using standard 12 m high capacity
              buses now or else in the future, their operations can't keep up
              with the increasing loadings but smaller interchanges and depots
              with fewer buses avaliable. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> They should ditch bendies.</p>

              <p>So u saying bendies have no advantages against DDs?! I can name a list. DDs are good and all I know that, but bendies have its own advantages and all as well.Your post above just described bendies as nothing but a useless junk, when it is NOT </p>
              <p>If u can, go operate a bus company yourself, then you can see your favourite DDs everyday and dunnid to put up with bendies. But for now, SMRT is buying bendies, and I can tell bendies are to stay in Singapore in a certain amount. ;)  </p>

              <p>2. Accepting Facts- We already accepted the facts, so be kind to us and don't make it worse and don't keep repeating the same thing over and over again.</p>

              <p>Please always be gracious. Up till now, I have not been rude to anyone online or even resort to using vulgarities.
