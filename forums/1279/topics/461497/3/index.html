              <p>It depends on how many starters they intend to hand over. If they give 6 then 2 will start from AMDEP straight to BP. Like 1237K 768B 788T start at BB does on weekends. Weekdays not sure.</p>

              <p>So you think any Tom, Dick and Harry can be a CEO of a company? Seems like you are more eager to take on his position. </p>
              <p>Your statement depicts how you simply to brush aside problems, and challenge who deem fit to fill up any position high enough to solve the problem. So there are so many people complaining about SMRT, should every single one of them be the CEO of SMRT as well? I'm not like you eyeing to be a CEO position but I would like to provide whatever feedback to them on their old and mismanaged ways in the pasts and hope the new CEO will rid the old systems, practices, and management.</p>
              <p>I am still accessing Mr Desmond Kuek's committment in improving the company, and rid of the old and mismanaged practices of the old management. Being a CEO is not a kid's play, like what you think it is.</p>

              <p>So you think any Tom, Dick and Harry can be a CEO of a company? Seems like you are more eager to take on his position. </p>
              <p>Your statement depicts how you simply to brush aside problems, and challenge who deem fit to fill up any position high enough to solve the problem. So there are so many people complaining about SMRT, should every single one of them be the CEO of SMRT as well? I'm not like you eyeing to be a CEO position but I would like to provide whatever feedback to them on their old and mismanaged ways in the pasts and hope the new CEO will rid the old systems, practices, and management.</p>
              <p>I am still accessing Mr Desmond Kuek's committment in improving the company, and rid of the old and mismanaged practices of the old management. Being a CEO is not a kid's play, like what you think it is.</p>

              <p><br>Relax. I want to know how you came to a conclusion that their management is "mismanaged", you listed out what you think SMRT is supposedly doing wrong and seem to have given a solution, it was a compliment, not a sarcasm.<br><br>But that brings me to the point of how in depth does everyone really know about SMRT to say that their management is mis-managed, it could be the tip of an iceberg.</p>
