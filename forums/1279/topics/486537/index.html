              I'm visiting Singapore (coming over from the UK) for three days at the start of November and I'm begging for help in locating just eight Volvo Olympians which are the only ones I've not yet managed to travel on. As a result of asking about this a few months ago, checking some online photos and matching the time the photo was taken with the direction of travel and by working out the non WAB lines on the SBS Transit times for the WAB routes I have some info, if anyone can expand on this, confirm its still current info or fill in the gaps I would be really grateful!
              
              9365P - does the 98 but I think this actually does the short 98A workings in the afternoon as I couldn't find it on any of the non-WAB duties at Jurong East on my last trip.
              
              9460Y - works 30, I think it might do the non WAB 0744 Bedok-Boon Lay, 1001 Boon Lay-Bedok, split shift, 1607 Bedok-Boon Lay, 1817 Boon Lay-Bedok.
              
              9469Z - works 196, I think this might work the non WAB 0907 Bedok-Clementi, 1133 Clementi-Bedok but I don't know what it does before or after.
              
              9482J - works the 548 then the 13- I think this does the 0750 548 from AMK Avenue 5 to Fullerton, then onto the 13 at 1109 Yio Chu Kang-Upper East Coast, 1254 Upper East Coast-Yio Chu Kang, 1500 Yio Chu Kang-Upper East Coast, 1643 Upper East Coast-Yio Chu Kang.
              
              9487X - works the 125 but shouldn't be too hard to find, there are three non WAB duties and all appear to be split shift as there are no non-WAB departures between 1012 and 1457 from St Michaels.
              
              9524Y - works the 31 and I need help finding this, I have seen it parked in Tampines for a long period during the day so suspect it may be a split shift, any times for this appreciated as finding it on a long non WAB service will be hard. Previous reporter saw it at about 0715 heading along Marine Parade Rd going towards Toa Payoh.
              
              9550X works the 107 and I also need help finding this. Previous reporter suggested it does a run from Hougang around 0715, runs empty back and does another trip at 0915. I did see it at around 1800 heading along Beach Road heading to Hougang on my last trip.
              
              9579P works the 8 and it's newly redeployed onto the 8 so any info on sightings would be appreciated.
              
              Many thanks!

              Thanks for the info, that's quite encouraging about 9524, it does suggest that it runs a few trips on the 31 on the afternoon shift, I might be able to seek that out during the evening.
              
              Acx1688- I'm trying to work out a very basic rough plan based on what I know or what gets reported, if I get more info or learn of changes I will adjust the plan! On my full day in Singapore I will start from my hotel (in Little India) and start by checking the 125 for 9487 on the non WAB slots, then wait on Bendemeer Road at stop B09 to see if either 9524 or 9550 turn up. Then position myself to catch the bus working the 1133 from Clementi on the 196 as far as Nicholl Highway B05, walk around to Geylang Road B04 and get the 13 bus that left Upper East Coast at 1254, catch that to Yio Chu Kang and same bus back to Sims Ave by Paya Lebar MRT. Then walk across to Changi Road and get the 30 that left Bedok at 1607 and travel through to Jurong, Corporation Drive and wait there to see if 9365 appears on a 98, 98A or 98M. If all that works out it will be a miracle and I'd be left with just two to get on the second day when I have to get the flight back to HK at 1830.
