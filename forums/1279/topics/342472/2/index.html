                      Ok, the maps below are from Upper Bukit Timah Rd all the way connecting to Upper Jurong Rd (the junction of Jln Bahar/Jln Boon lay)<br><br><a href="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9919.jpg"><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9919.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br><br><a href="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9917.jpg"><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9917.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br><br><a href="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9913.jpg"><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9913.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br><br><a href="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9926.jpg"><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9926.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br><br><a href="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9925.jpg"><img src="http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll63/SBS8191E/IMG_9925.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a><br><br>Well, one thing I should emphasise on older Singapore Street Directories of the 1980s or even earlier than that, certain landmarks like churches (places of worship), cemeteries, community centres, markets were not listed on the sectional maps. Though the community centres and markets were listed on the indexes of the Street Directory, but the maps listed C.C. (for Community Centres) due to some space constraints. Some churches (or places of worship) were not even listed on the indexes and the map simply put "Church" on it. Another thing to point out is the old Bulim Chinese Cemetery, on the street directory itself, it was an un-named cemetery and basically it stated "Chinese Cemetery" on the map. However, if you check the bus routes of 174 &amp; 175 in the Bus Guide 1985, you would see one of the bus stop landmark "Os Bulim Cemetery" of the Jurong Rd column (i.e. after the "Aft Corporation Rd" landmark).<br><br>Speaking about the old Bulim Chinese Cemetery, as according to the map, it was linked with Hong Kah Drive, Jurong Rd Track 28, 30 &amp; 32 as well as Lorong Kabong, which is made up of the entire land, although its a short distance linked from other cemeteries located in Choa Chu Kang Rd. However, Bulim Chinese Cemetery can also be accessible through roads that serve Kg Tengah (which is Jln Berseri) and drive through Hong Kah Drive from Choa Chu Kang Rd as a shortcut.

              <p>Well, we had one on Jurong Rd. I was researching <strong>Clemeaceau Ave</strong> recently.</p>
              <p>This road ran from havelock Rd to Bukit Timah Rd. Very useful for a short cut from toa Payoh to Orchard rd or to new Brdige Rd .</p>
              <p>Sadly the CTE cut it into two and now there is this Clemeceau Ave North which does not link to the current Clemeaceau Ave. <br><br>SBS service 165 used to ply the entire stretch.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The very first version of 165 ran like this:-<br>165Â  SEMBAWANG HILLS EST - NEW BRIDGE RD - JURONG<br>type of svc - trunk, companion of svc 166<br><br>via SBW hills sest, Upp Thomson rd, Thomson rd, Newton rd, Clemeaceau Ave full length, Pulau saigon rd, havelock rd, NBR rd, Outram rd, tiong bahru rd, commonwelath ave , alexandra rd, Ayer rajah rd (Today AYE), Dover rd, clementi rd, Ayer rajah rd, upp ayer rajah rd and into Jurong Ind est.</p>
              <p>Later svc 165 was re aligned to run along lornie rd and farrer rd towards Jurong (it is todays 165) and this svc 164 took over the route covering up for the lost links of svc165. The service enver did make it that far to the west and ending in town. A service 176 then did the better job of linking Dover Rd to town than the long and windy 165. <br><br>And thats the story of Cleamceau ave and my search for a bus svc that ran full along this unqiue short cut road of the 1980s.<br><br>ZYX</p>

              <p>For unknown reasons, maybe to build the HDB flats, this extremely fast link to TPY was removed. A few bus services used to ply that route to TPY.</p>

              <p>PIE cut that link into half in the late 1970s, not CTE. It was called Kim Keat Link. Anybody noticed that the road name changed from Jalan Bahagia to Kim Keat Road along the curve outside Blk 52. Its because the junction to Kim Keat Link started from that curve.</p>

              <p><br>Another road cut nearby was Whompoa Drive to Towner Rd. Notice after the predestrain crossing at Whompoa Drive there's a funny turn where the taxi stand is?</p>
              <p>This road links to Towner Road across the CTE and ya the CTE cut it. If i'm not wrong Jln Keban Limau formed a junction with Jln Bahagia and that's probably the reason<br>(i) why the CTE (AYE) slip road to Balestier Rd outside ITE Balestier has a road name<br>(ii) why there's an odd Jln bahagia exit on CTE (SLE) with no corresponding entrance whatsoever.</p>
              <p>And seriously the CTE cuts alot of roads from AMK Ave 1 southbound.</p>

              When the Tuas Terminal at Pioneer Rd was cloased &amp; demolished, the route of 175 was shortened to operate at Bt Batok Int and it was withdrawn later, means that it was never shortened to loop at Upp Bukit Timah Rd or extended to Lim Chu Kang. At the same time, Prince Edward Rd Ter was also closed and thus services operating from Prince Edward Rd were re-routed and called from Shenton Way Ter<br><br>Service 175 was introduced a number of times.
