              <p>Hi, i'm new here, not sure if this topic is related to this forum, just trying my luck to seek for your help.</p>
              <p><br>i always wonder about where the first road of jurong, jurong road, starts and ends. when i took svc 174 once, it goes through a road beside PIE, between jurong west ave 2 and bukit batok road, that gave me the first impression of jurong road. later on, i found the stretch of road south to bukit batok nature park, between bb east ave 6 and upp bukit timah road, is called "old jurong road", near bukit timah fire station. surprisingly, there is a section of jurong road at the junction of jurong west ave 2 and corporation road, but it's been abandoned.</p>
              <p>So I think the old jurong road starts from bukit timah fire station and ends at the junction of jalan bahar/jalan boon lay/jurong west ave 2/jurong west ave 4. from jurong west ave 4, it's then upper jurong road, cutting over the stadium and jurong west st 93, connected to the upper jurong road now. jurong road follows jurong west ave 2, then PIE to bukit batok road, but i'm not sure how jurong road passes through bukit batok area, anyone knows about this? thanks in advance.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>The olden days of Jurong Rd was actually leads to the kampong areas of Jurong (i.e. from Bukit Timah to the Jurong Area), thereafter it continues to the Tuas area as Upp Jurong Rd. Noticeably the segments of Jurong Rd were shortened most probably the new developments of Bukit Batok &amp; Jurong HDB new towns and as well as the PIE. Upp Jurong Rd, on the other hand was cut short as well for the extension of PIE to Corporation Rd. And again in the 1990s, part of PIE ending at Corporation Rd was renamed as Jurong West Ave 2, as the PIE was proposed to extend to Tuas and at the same time, Jurong Rd (10-12ms area) was cut short again, a few villages and small industrial factories still existed along Jurong Rd. If you can recall services like 143, it terminates at the terminal facing the Jurong Rd 10 ms Market before it eventually extended to Penjuru Rd and for 174, it plys through certain stretch of Jurong Rd before reaching or leaving NTI Bus terminal (known as NTU now).</div>

              <p>From Bt Batok Flyover at Jurong Town Hall Rd, it goes straight to the area behind Blks 172 174 175 then heads North-Eastward to behind Blk 182 192 191, cuts thru Bt Batok Swimming Complex and then follow Bt Batok East Ave 6 to Old Jurong Rd. Of course along Bt Batok East Ave 6 there's a little deviation but nothing much.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder how SBS997A travels along Jurong Rd while it was a 174 permer..<br><br>In addition , Corporation Rd that leads to Jurong Rd was permanently closed to vehicular traffic. Before the permanent road closure, there were several heavy vehicle parked there illegally. Also along the Jurong Rd, there were some disused bus stops (served by 174 &amp; 175) after the shortening of Jurong Rd to make way for the PIE Extension to Tuas were abandoned for many years until they were being removed..</div>

                      areas of Jurong (i.e. from Bukit Timah to the Jurong Area),
                      thereafter it continues to the Tuas area as Upp Jurong Rd.
                      Noticeably the segments of Jurong Rd were shortened most probably
                      the new developments of Bukit Batok &amp; Jurong <span>HDB</span> new towns and as well as the <span>PIE</span>. Upp Jurong Rd, on the other hand was cut short as
                      well for the extension of <span>PIE</span> to Corporation
                      Rd. And again in the 1990s, part of <span>PIE</span> ending at Corporation Rd was renamed as Jurong West Ave 2, as the
                      <span>PIE</span> was proposed to extend to Tuas and at the
                      same time, Jurong Rd (10-12ms area) was cut short again, a few
                      villages and small industrial factories still existed along Jurong
                      Rd. If you can recall services like 143, it terminates at the
                      terminal facing the Jurong Rd 10 ms Market before it eventually
                      extended to Penjuru Rd and for 174, it plys through certain stretch
                      of Jurong Rd before reaching or leaving <span>NTI</span> Bus terminal (known as <span>NTU</span> now).</p>

              <p>the part of <span>PIE</span> ending at Corporation Rd was renamed as Jurong West Ave 2 till the Jln Bahar/Jln Boon Lay junction when Jurong West Ave 3, St 22/23/24/25 were constructed &amp; named, also 157 was amended to skip Boon Lay Ave.</p>
