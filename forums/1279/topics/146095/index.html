            <div class='col-md body'>Social responsibility or just poor business sense?<br><br>I've come to notice that most of these buses are empty and probably losing money. The Citybuzz buses are double decker, and one would be lucky to see an ang-moh, much less a local, sitting on the upper deck. The drivers also seem to be in a hurry, even taking the middle lane in Orchard Road. Looking at the relative success of the Hippo buses, Citybuzz just pales in comparison.<br><br>Chinatown buses, though quick and direct, are probably still losing money, as they reduced the frequency of the buses recently.<br><br>Perhaps the SBS wants to improve its image following its highly unpopular price hikes in 2003, but some of its new services just signals poor planning and business sense. The citybuzz buses probably never expected much traffic in the first place, but why implement them when there are so many modes of transport to get arnd the city. (esp your two feet)? More worryingly, ridiculous services like the Labrador Park bus were implemented when walking into the park is probably quicker and more aesthetically pleasing than waiting at the bus stop.<br><br>The SBS has indeed lived up to its promise that higher fares bring about a greater variety and a higher standard of service. Yet, it needs to seriously consider how it should go about doing so, to bring maximum benefit to botht the people and the company.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Remember sitting on the Citybuzz Sv C1 for bus ride and sit for the whole journey. Only five people took only and only take for a few bus stop which I know other bus service can travel to there not only citybuzz. Maybe they take as it is empty and so they can enjoy the spacious space and the air con too. I suggest that C1,C2 and C3 can merged into one service rather by spilting it.</div>
