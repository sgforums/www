(45c for Primary, Secondary, ITE, <strong>JC</strong>) adults pay a minimum fare of 64c already. and as what PTC claims, concession fares are cross-subsidised by full-paying adult fares. (maybe the fare of 45c are understated, and adult fares are overstated).<br><br>also, Citybuzz main target are tourists. and yes, its fares at $1 is admittedly cheap. the minimum cash fare for trunk services is now at 90c minimum, and on board crowded buses. still, the freq is also deteriorating<br><br>Chinatown Direct services are targetted at Senior Citizens, though children gets a special fare of $1.00 for an Express Service. Freq is at 30-35 mins, means you cant rely on them to get to other destinations if you are in a hurry.<br><br>Express Services (eg.sv506) are premium services also targetted at working adults. Students can hardly be seen taking them, and they may not have any reason to, as express services cross towns for long distances, and which students go to schools nearby their homes...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>of course, IMO, i dare say SBS does not really like concession holders as this means a decrease in fare revenue. one adult tap will yield 65c up to 156c. one child will only earns 45c.. of course the adult fare is preferred. and there is this pattern of BC disliking students and may give them "special treatment" i had seen it.. bahhhh.<br><br>still, many 45c passengers are picky when they uses BCP and prevent themselves from taking Express or MRT (cannot be used with BCP). so.. wheres the conflict? i guess the high fares are to deter certain groups of passengers from taking the services, which m not complaining as i excercise flexibility as an adult-paying passenger..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

(45c for Primary, Secondary, ITE, [b]JC</strong>) adults pay a minimum fare of 64c already. and as what PTC claims, concession fares are cross-subsidised by full-paying adult fares. (maybe the fare of 45c are understated, and adult fares are overstated).<br><br>also, Citybuzz main target are tourists. and yes, its fares at $1 is admittedly cheap. the minimum cash fare for trunk services is now at 90c minimum, and on board crowded buses. still, the freq is also deteriorating<br><br>Chinatown Direct services are targetted at Senior Citizens, though children gets a special fare of $1.00 for an Express Service. Freq is at 30-35 mins, means you cant rely on them to get to other destinations if you are in a hurry.<br><br>Express Services (eg.sv506) are premium services also targetted at working adults. Students can hardly be seen taking them, and they may not have any reason to, as express services cross towns for long distances, and which students go to schools nearby their homes...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>of course, IMO, i dare say SBS does not really like concession holders as this means a decrease in fare revenue. one adult tap will yield 65c up to 156c. one child will only earns 45c.. of course the adult fare is preferred. and there is this pattern of BC disliking students and may give them "special treatment" i had seen it.. bahhhh.<br><br>still, many 45c passengers are picky when they uses BCP and prevent themselves from taking Express or MRT (cannot be used with BCP). so.. wheres the conflict? i guess the high fares are to deter certain groups of passengers from taking the services, which m not complaining as i excercise flexibility as an adult-paying passenger..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> [/b]</blockquote>Express 506 has considerable amount(1-3) of students taking it in the early morning and afternoon, 3-5pm on each bus.</div>

Or maybe they are not rich and just rushing for times for something as not a lot of people willing to take Express Service so the bus can skip some bus stop and the journey is faster????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is that on services that yield less income, e.g. industrial services where adults pay 59c to $1 compared to 64c to $1.64 on trunk services, standards tend to be lower. We must be prepared to pay more, as SBS is now run like a business.</div>
