I disagree with this viewer's opinion. As a 193 cm person, I have no complaints about the bus's interior design. Legroom space is pretty ok for me and the height is reasonable. If you dont like this bus, don't take it , simple as that.<br><br>Anyway, 7410E was spotted on svc 2 this morning, which "champion" saw this bus on 51 ? Anyway 7447A is an additional B9TL bus for BN's svc 7.<br><br>As far as I know, svc 161 will not be a WAB svc until Woodlands have lifts installed. Until then, cameo B9TL buses will be on 161 frequently.<br></div>

This is especially noticeable during peak hours.<br>Although the new bus design is nicer on the exterior, it has totally failed in the interior. Let's start at the rear of the interior.<br><br>At the rear, there is room for only a single passenger to stand. When someone wants to alight and tries to move out from a back row seat, the standing passenger in the middle of the aisle has difficulty moving aside to make way.<br><br>The aisle in the middle of the bus is narrow too, and has space for only a single line of standing passengers. The old design could accommodate double standing lines.<br><br>The ceiling is also too low. Taller passengers cannot stand in the aisle in the middle of the bus.<br><br>At the rear of the bus, there are two seats on either side facing each other. The design of these seats is questionable too. Very few passengers take them. Often, the the whole bus is packed and these seats are left empty. They are a waste of space on board.<br><br>And the step up to the rear of the bus is too high, which makes it a safety hazard. This is bad for passengers, especially the elderly. I saw many of them having difficulty climbing up or down the step. Some did not notice it, or forgot it was there, and almost tripped.<br><br>Why design such a high step? Is it to discourage people from moving to the rear of the bus, or to discourage them from standing there?<br><br>Maybe because of all this, most passengers prefer to stand near the front exit, which is also the area for handicapped passengers. This area becomes packed as everyone squeezes in there and refuses to move to the rear.<br><br>Hence the new design is no improvement on the old one. In fact, it is worse.<br><br>Isn't the new design supposed to accommodate more passengers?<br><br>The driver likes to yell at passengers to move to the rear, but I guess he hardly looks at the rear himself. With so little space, how can passengers move to the rear? We commuters are really trying already.<br><br>I hope the next bus design will be better and able to accommodate more passengers in safety.<br>[/b]</blockquote>can give link?</div>
