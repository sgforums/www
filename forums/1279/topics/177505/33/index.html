            <div class='col-md body'>B9TLs on 147 are quite a let-down, because much of the route passes through congested areas, the bus kept switching between 2,3,4 gear and kept down-shifting everytime the BC steps the pedal harder. At first the ride was ok, but as the ride progressed, it just becomes irritating. It does not help that the B9TL has a powerful engine and everytime the bus accelerates it vibrates. Consequently the ride was jerky despite the BC's efforts to keep the ride steady. If you ask me, the ZF B9TLs should be deployed for svcs with smoother traffic, the Voith B9TLs may be better off for congested svcs.

As far as I can see, the turbo kick is so great, many BCs often release the pedal slightly after the lock-up engages.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey , is it true that the B9TLs that emit a wheeeeeerrrrrrrrrrooo sound is a ZFed one? Cuz i've heard this sound from the B9TLs deployed on 196 at bedok interchange, which i think sounds similar to SBS9888Y. Hmm i think that the side view of the B9TLs is extremely dazling, dont ye think? Green tinted glass?? I find that they are more dazling from the side than the Habits.</div>
