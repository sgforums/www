SBS Transit does away with such unnecessities for most of their buses, and the result is that they are able to purchase more buses at a fraction of the cost if they had brought in buses with EDS systems, which translates into more buses to use for completely new routes or for routes with higher demand (compare this with how A$$MRT rarely start completely new bus routes (their "new" routes are often the result of merging or seperating existing routes), while they struggle to cope with existing demand).<br><br>Besides, side EDS display less information than placards, while the front EDS often squeeze in too much unnecessary information, when all we need to know is the bus number. Also, older EDSes are not very visible at night.<br><br>Just to add: EDSes are also more likely to get spoilt, with dead pixels and problems like that. You should see the front EDS of one of the buses on route 963; there seems to be a problem with the dots flipping over or something.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eX.A.K.R.:</div><div class="quote_body">But remember that this is at the cost of having insufficient (and needlessly expensive) buses to go around. SBS Transit does away with such unnecessities for most of their buses, and the result is that they are able to purchase more buses at a fraction of the cost if they had brought in buses with EDS systems, which translates into more buses to use for completely new routes or for routes with higher demand (compare this with how A$$MRT rarely start completely new bus routes (their "new" routes are often the result of merging or seperating existing routes), while they struggle to cope with existing demand).<br><br>Besides, side EDS display less information than placards, while the front EDS often squeeze in too much unnecessary information, when all we need to know is the bus number. Also, older EDSes are not very visible at night.<br><br>Just to add: EDSes are also more likely to get spoilt, with dead pixels and problems like that. You should see the front EDS of one of the buses on route 963; there seems to be a problem with the dots flipping over or something.<br></div></blockquote>That is why commuters can get a fast ride on SMRT... the drivers are always rushing.... SBST buses are slow and are uncomfortable and usually have small legrooms...<br>At least for EDS, SMRT is always willing to fix and replace them....<br>unlike 9888Y....spoilt, then throw...<br><br>anyway, does anybody know how much the B9TL costs?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If what i speculate is in doubt, then how's it noone in SBST did any correction to the windscreen sticker on that B9TL to lay claim as 1st Euro-4 bus here instead of Euro-3 ?!??<br><br>Technical specifications themselves are based on certain very specific assumptions/conditions being met, otherwise even workshop technical specifications etc. need not be an accurate depiction of the actual product @ hand.
