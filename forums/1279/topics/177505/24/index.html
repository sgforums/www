Never mind, now I know how smart you are now! Why dont u scroll up to see the previous posts and see why i started commenting on your photographs?<br><br>Okay, seriously. If you really want to act childish or rebellous, please do so in front of the mirror. I find that not only that you are evading at the comments that are shot out to you, you try to act smart by asking simply intellectual questions. Well done!</div>

I had the chance to ride this bus last Sunday (SBS 7302J - the one with the commemorative livery), and I have to say, this is one beautiful bus. Acceleration and deceleration was smooth, and the air-conditioner is top-rated (very much like SBS 9889U's). The engine also sounded quieter and better, very unlike the Volvo Super Olympians (which was too loud and low-pitched, like some kind of a bull). The interior was also very well designed, striking a perfect balance between a modern design and a functional design. The colour scheme - with it's hues of yellows, greens, and gold - was much better than SBS 9889U's, whose hues of blue and purple, while sleek and cool-feeling, was rather overwhelming. I also like the new ez-link Card readers' colour scheme, with it's two tones of not-too-contrasting grays (p.s. I saw one such reader installed on a particular SMRT Mercedes MB O405 bus a few days ago, seemingly replacing an older spoilt one - seems like whoever are making them decided to use a new colour scheme). Leg and head room was great - my long legs had no problems on several seats I tried, and I can actually stand up straight - all 1.8 metres of me - on the upper deck! Not since childhood times had I managed to do this on a double-deck bus.<br><br>Exterior-wise, I find not too many problems with it. In fact, it looks very sleek and stylish, and the so-called "one-piece" windscreen manages to look like it's fabricated from a piece of glass, even though it's really three joined together. Viewed from a certain angle, these buses even exudes an air of nostalgia - they somehow look and feel like those "classic" style of buses from the 1950's and 1960's Singapore. Maybe it's the deeper-than-usual roofline at the front...<br><br>One gripe though - the upper deck front windscreen is just too dark, and distorts the outside world too much. I have never seen something like this before - and it's just headache-inducing. The upper deck front row seats are usually my favourite seats on double deck buses, but not this one.<br><br>Also, I don't know if this is a problem isolated to just the particular bus I took, but the exit door alarm sounded like a botched-up version of the ones we hear on the Super Olympians. Until I can take other such buses, I want to believe that this problem is isolated to this particular bus only.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now it's my review.<br>volvo b9tl<br>The chassis is good but the body work is like s**t. gotta hate the front part. Cannot see properly during night time. The windscreen should be flat and if you want curves put it at the side just like ALX and Volgren bodywork. Body llooks like a modified version of the Wright bodywork though. Seats are ok but the vandalism are not. Hmm back of the bus looks very nice but would look better if they place the single top left blinkers on both left and right. Interior is nice. Basically i hate the front and like the back lol. I wonder y sbst never put the ramps on the volgrens and tridents. They can convert the SLF into SLF-WAB buses wad?</div>
