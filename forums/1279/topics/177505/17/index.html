From 27 June 2006, 10 buses in the existing Service 21 fleet will come with wheelchair-friendly features such as a manually operated ramp for boarding and alighting, and a single wheelchair parking space.<br><br>LTA has required all new public buses registered in Singapore from 2006 to be wheelchair-accessible. These buses will be introduced progressively to replace the existing fleet of non-wheelchair-accessible buses. The decision to introduce wheelchair-accessible buses was made following a review by the Ministry of Transport and LTA, and is in line with the recommendation from the Committee on Ageing Issues. MOT has approved the funds for the incremental cost for the wheelchair-accessible buses at $6,000 per bus for 3,550 buses over the next 17 years.<br><br>Improvements at bus interchanges and bus stops<br><br>LTA has carried out localized modifications at the alighting and boarding berths of Pasir Ris Bus Interchange and St MichaelÂ’s Bus Terminal for the convenience of wheelchair users. Additional reinforced concrete slabs have been built to provide sufficient manoeuvre space for wheelchair users to board and alight, while an additional footpath has been built to allow wheelchair users to get to the boarding berth without going into the narrow queue rails.<br><br>LTA has also carried out a series of modifications worksks, such as the construction of ramps to replace steps, to ensure that the majority of the bus stops along the route of Service 21 are accessible to wheelchair users.<br><br>The improvements at bus interchanges and bus stops will be implemented progressively islandwide as LTA and the public transport operators introduce more WAB services.<br><br>Due to major site constraints, seven out of 126 bus stops along the route of Service 21 are not accessible to wheelchair users. They are:<br><br>B08 Balestier Road opposite Balestier Point<br><br>B06 Geylang Road opposite Mohd Salleh Mosque<br><br>B12 Geylang Road after Lorong 34 Geylang<br><br>B14 Geylang Road opposite Lorong 39 Geylang<br><br>B17 Balestier Road after Irrawaddy Road<br><br>B03 Kitchener Road before Tai Hoe Hotel<br><br>B04 Thomson Road outside Novena Station<br><br>These seven bus stops are adjacent to privately owned five-foot ways that are narrow and have steps, hence they are inaccessible to wheelchair users. Notices have been put up at each of these bus stops and on-board the WABs to inform wheelchair users of these inaccessible bus stops. LTA has also worked with the voluntary welfare organisations to disseminate this information to their members and associated organisations.<br><br>Wheelchair users can board or alight at one bus stop before or after these inaccessible bus stops. (Pleases note that bus stops B12 and B14, along Geylang Road, are consecutive inaccessible bus stops.)<br><br>LTA will work with the relevant authorities to look into ways to carry out modification works progressively at these inaccessible bus stops, so as to minimise the inconvenience to the wheelchair users.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wheelchair-friendly buses set to hit the roads </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : The Singapore Bus Service will begin its wheelchair accessible bus service on Tuesday.<br><br>Ten wheelchair-friendly buses will be hitting the roads; they will be the first of more than 3,500 the bus company is acquiring over the next 17 years.<br><br>The buses represent a huge milestone for the physically challenged, like 37-year-old Tam Ah Hock, who is president of the Handicaps Welfare Association.<br><br>Singapore's first wheelchair friendly buses -- on SBS service 21 -- will ply the Pasir Ris to St Michael's route daily.<br><br>To commemorate this occasion, all wheelchair-bound passengers will get to travel free till the end of July.<br><br>Service 21 was chosen for the launch after consultation with Voluntary Welfare Organisations and the Land Transport Authority.<br><br>The service runs past the Handicaps Welfare Association in Whampoa, and allows its members direct access to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and other medical facilities.<br><br>Passengers in wheelchairs will have a specially-designated area with a padded backrest, handrails and a button to signal their intention to alight.<br><br>Said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, "Getting onto a public bus is just step one. But the real objective is to make sure you go to work, get to school, enjoy recreational activities and even more important, to be together with your family. No point in having a family outing if you have to leave somebody behind."<br><br>The minister also asked the public to be understanding and gracious to people in wheelchairs and to make way for them.<br><br>Said Sherena Loh Shook Han, member of the Handicaps Welfare Association, "We do not mind being looked at for the fact that we're different; we're on a wheelchair. But the only thing is probably the people would be a bit more mindful if no unkind remarks are passed. Otherwise it would discourage the disabled person to come again."<br><br>As part of the public awareness for this new service, motorists are asked to steer clear of bus stops as the wheelchair-friendly buses need to stop close to the kerbs to deploy the ramp properly.<br><br>To ensure the safety and comfort of passengers in wheelchairs, the bus captains have been trained to operate the wheelchair ramp and take care of their ticketing needs, if asked to. - CNA<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/215762/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/215762/1/.html</a><br></div>
