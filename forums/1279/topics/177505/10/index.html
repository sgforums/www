Members are strictly screened and even monitored after joining. The moment tehe member creats trouble he will be booted out. The posts there do not have bickerings. Serious discussions only. And even in arguments, its done soundly. Thats why I like that forum so much as to try my best to restrict as much previledge to that forum as possible. Even the technical notes that are not classified I have during my courses conducted in HG also let the bus info hub forum members photo copy. The B9TL electrical diagram only give to the members of Bus info hub only. But I gave the B9TL test drive at SLBP today and my CNG tech guide to a couple of SGforums people also. Can ask around.</div></blockquote>1) Are they members of BIH Forum also?<br><br>I noe its some1 living in the west and studying in the west.</div>
