Do u mean those B9TL only overtake those buses during the last trips but kana overtake by other buses during other timing? Are you sure the MB 0405 are unable to overtake B9TL. Oh got, pls answer me why I always see the MB on Express 502 speeding here and there along PIE? Dun really believe that a single deck can't match wit a DD in terms of acceleration. Btw, u can see those MB 0405 from svc 154, svc 197 and especially 97E (ffw buses) overtake svc 198's B9TL along AYE. Most of the BC try to overtake the B9TL along JW st 51 cos they are really moving quite slow.</div>

Do u mean those B9TL only overtake those buses during the last trips but kana overtake by other buses during other timing? Are you sure the MB 0405 are unable to overtake B9TL. Oh got, pls answer me why I always see the MB on Express 502 speeding here and there along PIE? Dun really believe that a single deck can't match wit a DD in terms of acceleration. Btw, u can see those MB 0405 from svc 154, svc 197 and especially 97E (ffw buses) overtake svc 198's B9TL along AYE. Most of the BC try to overtake the B9TL along JW st 51 cos they are really moving quite slow.</div></blockquote>We'll never know whether the B9TLs or the MB O405s are faster unless we put them side by side and ask them to accelerate off together..but one thing's for sure..the MB has lotsa low-end torque..so acceleration actually not bad..may stand a chance against the B9TL..but again, the B9TLs have turbos which the MBs of SBST doesn't have..turbos boost power too..and the turbo on a B9TL kicks in quite early, so low-down torque also not bad..so it's still hard to get a winner..haha.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
