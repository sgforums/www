            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>For those who love taking the bus (bus fans and those who like to experience different backgrounds during their journey):</p>
              <p>Took TIB582U (WLDEP SP) on 858 (858PM02) from Yishun to Changi Airport yesterday. As the bus speeds from Yishun Ave 2 to Lentor Avenue, it mounts onto the slope to the SLE (Seletar Expressway). After a short period in the forests of Seletar, the bus finally turns onto the TPE (Tampines Expressway) and passes through the construction site of the new viaduct to connect the TPE to Seletar West Link in the future. </p>
              <p>The new viaduct will benefit drivers to use Yishun Ave 1 to get into the town (where there is a bridge with two opposite directions located between the garters on the sides of the road, which separates it from the wonderful scenic view of the Lower Seletar Reservoir) and also the Seletar industrial area. The industrial landscape and new girters between the two directions of the expressway makes the passengers think that they are in another country and travelling in a modern landscape, rather than the natural forests.</p>
              <p>After a few minutes, the bus goes onto yet another flyover and turns into a narrow section of the northern end of Jalan Kayu, where two different bus stops for two directions of bus services stop respectively. The bus stops at the first bus stop (in front), before turning onto the slope down back to the TPE. From that bus stop, the bus speeds at about 60km/h non-stop to Changi Airport.</p>
              <p>The bus passes through the area between Punggol and Sengkang, passing under the flyover at Punggol Road. There are plans to have new bus stops at the flyover, where the bus services (39, 161, 168 and 858) will stop at the bus stops, before continuing on their journeys on the TPE. After the flyover, the bus will go under the flyover for the KPE. </p>
              <p>After a short sprint through the forests and Tampines/Pasir Ris industrial area, the bus cruises on over the flyover, passing the unmistakable Tampines IKEA building, in blue with the company logo in yellow. The bus will pass by a few slip roads to Pasir Ris, before going under the Tampines Ave 12 flyover. With the slope for the traffic going to Tampines/Pasir Ris coated with new tarmac, it looks strange, as the slope curves at an angle before going up.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After the bus passes through the shallow trees hiding the estates on both sides of the expressway, it will pass over the Loyang Ave flyover. It helps to provide connection to Tampines Ave 7, Pasir Ris and Changi Village, a popular place for the locals to visit, which also houses the jetty to Pulau Ubin, a well-known survivng 'kampung', which has survived Singapore's urbanisation. The bus will then go on the downward slope to connect to the PIE (at Upper Changi East flyover), which indicates the end of the TPE.</span></p>
              <p>The bus passes through the Changi industrial area and passes by the boundaries of the airport. At the end of the expreesway, the bus takea the left fork at the end and goes onto Airport Boulevard, the end of the ECP. It will pass by some lonely bus stops for staff and between the two directions of the road lies a huge blossom of pink flowers, giving visitors the beauty of Changi Airport. The bus passes under some flyovers, before finally turning into the slip road to the T3 basement bus area.</p>
              <p>During the ride, the old bus did a good job in bringing the passengers from Yishun to Changi Airport in a very quick 20 - 25mins. Overall, the bus was not the main attraction here, but the different landscapes during that long ride was what satisfied the passengers. Sometimes, the ride makes you enjoy the bus! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p><strong>In this thread, you can describe your feelings of how you enjoyed your ride on the bus! Have fun!</strong></p>

              <p>LOL... I just find that most buses I take, the BCs can speed like mad, remember I rode one 961 bus (TIB533L), the BC speed like mad... Anyway, off-topic = SBS9642P (BRBP 157) BC today was listening to 93.3FM on the radio, in the cab! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"> Wonder if anyone has ever encountered a BC listening to the radio while driving... <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Took SBS9642P (BRBP 157) on 157 yesterday. I boarded the bus at Braddell Road and the first thing I realised was that the BC was listening to 93.3FM on the radio! Anyway, got on and went up to the upper deck.</p>
              <p>From Braddell Road, the bus turns left onto Thomson Road and travels underneath the viaduct connecting Upper Thomson Road to Lornie Road, opposite Macritchie Reservoir. After the bus stop, it travels up a curvy slope onto Lornie Road, joining the traffic from the viaduct. The quiet forests surround the traffic and makes the ride peaceful and brief, yet enjoyable, unlike Bukit Timah Road which is notorious for traffic jams. After the forests, the bus passes by a junction with Cluny Road and passes over Adam flyover. Then, the bus will stop after just passing by The Japanese Association. After leaving the stop, it goes to the left of the fork between Adam Road and Farrer flyover. I got off at the bus stop before the bus will turn onto Bukit Timah Road</p>
              <p>During this rather brief ride, I liked the quiet and peaceful ride onboard a faithful old DD, which has served SBS Transit for years. Don't forget the BC playing 93.3FM on the radio! I wonder if BC ever play the radio while driving nowadays... <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              <p>2004: NWFB 601 from Kwun Tong to North Point on a then relatively new Dennis Trident ALX500. Had fun standing right at the entrance (AM peak so bus packed like sardine) and was especially so when the bus made turns while I stood right next to the windscreen. Entering Lam Tin Bus Terminus (the driveway which required buses to turn several times) as well as entering (down slope) and exiting (270 degree loop) EHT was fun! The bus itself had a really silent gearbox, and very smooth ride indeed. Loved how NWFB furnished its Tridents, with purple flooring and blue handrails. The front was calmed with a gentle neon blue lighting. </p>
              <p>2010: CTB E22A from TLK to CLK on a Dennis Trident DM-bodied (Single door). Night ride and Lung Cheung Rd was deserted so the bus was furiously fast, literally sped through like a bullet. As a result, took only 40 minutes to reach airport! Stunning! The ride was great especially when the bus was speeding on the Tsing Ma Bridge. Smooth yet fast. Overtook some cars so estimated speed around 80+km/h. </p>
              <p>2011: SMRT 858 on SMB19H from CGA to Jln Kayu. Deserted bus so had a big airy space to myself. Gently cruising along the TPE with the morning sun is really just pure bliss ^^. Aircon was blasting, just great. Best ride so far in SG. </p>
              <p>2011: SMRT 965 on TIB459T from Admiralty to Sengkang. Beautiful synchronised engine sound throughout TPE ride. Exciting speed when exiting Sengkang, went over 60km/h! </p>
              <p>2013: KMB 296D on AVBE3 from Jordan to Sheung Tak. Again standing at the door. Very comfortable non-stop trip with fast acceleration and smooth cruising from East Kowloon corridor onwards! Quiet and fast ride! BC was very skilled, able to manage speed and deceleration properly, didn't lose my balance once! Especially when glomg down the slope after exiting TKO Tunnel. Well managed speed and made it down without any big deal. Direct and long express sectors from the city is the reason why people have a more confortale ride! Less falling, losing balance and stops, thus less people squeezing their way out! SG should learn from them, seriously! </p>
