When 2 similar service brunch up, a passenger may flag down the one behind, but a SMRT driver whos not stopping for anyone alighting waves away the customer and continuing his race, making the passenger having to run infront for the 1st bus. Also many SMRT drivers race and race, and even sometimes see long Q of buses at bus stop, skip the bus stop completely.. (example of  852 along YCK)<br><br>SBS side, well, all complain of road hogging, but many SBS drivers sometimes drive into the bus stop (although no one flag) and suddenly some one flag when the bus is in the bus stop.. so theres some good in it. If driver does not go into the bus stop, he at least take a quick glance for any sudden flag-downs..<br><br>SMRT drivers only interested in counting how many SBS buses they can overtake.. (experience along countless sv74 journeys along Bt Timah)</div>
