            <div class='col-md body'>Reason is Because for DD Bus, In the past before the NEL days, there was a VERY HIGH demand for 501/502.. thats why there was More DD Bus than SD bus on 502.. Another reason is.. Its called Express is because it USED to be a EXPRESS Service from Hougang Ctr Int.. BUt, as SengKang Town Starts to developed in a very quick pace and people living in SengKang complained that there wasnt any xpress service to the city. Thats why 501 and 502 was then extend to SengKang Int. Reason that the last Bus leaves at 10 plus is because in the night, people would normally go for train instead of Bus as they want to go home faster..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, looking at this case of 502, it's not unreasonable to use DDs and extend operation hours to end half to one hour later, given that resources are available. too bad i'm not SBSTransit staff. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's NOT even an Express service anymore. In my opinion, I think SBST should convert it into a regular trunk service, calling at all the stops on the way. Remember Express 521? I think 502 should undergo that kind of change too. Whatever the service number, it's fine with me.</div>
