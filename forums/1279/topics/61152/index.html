            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Overview </strong><br><br>1. The Public Transport Council (PTC) announced today the results of its annual audit on basic bus services operated by SBS Transit Limited (SBST) and Trans-Island Bus Services Limited (Tibs). For the first time, detailed audit results of selected bus services are also published.<br><br>2. The audit is to determine the bus operators' compliance with the 33 service standards set by the PTC. The findings were determined through on-site surveys by independent consultants commissioned by the PTC, information declared by the bus operators and data provided by relevant agencies (such as HDB and LTA). The on-site surveys covered 50% of the trunk and residential feeder bus services.<br><br>3. Similar to last year, this year's audit results show that the bus operators have generally complied with the 20 mandatory standards and majority of the 13 discretionary standards. For mandatory standards, both operators achieved an overall compliance level of at least 95%.<br><br><strong>Highlights of Audit Findings </strong><br><br>On the whole, the audit results show that the overall level of bus service was consistently high. The following findings are noteworthy:<br><br>All areas on the main island of Singapore were served by at least one bus service within 400 metres except in areas with very low demand, e.g., low-density private estates, underdeveloped areas;<br>All HDB neigbourhoods were connected directly to their respective bus interchange;<br><br>All HDB towns were connected directly to the Central Business District (CBD) and major activity centres;<br>All MRT stations were served by at least one bus service;<br>All feeder services in HDB towns started before 6 am and stopped after midnight;<br><br>All HDB towns served by the MRT had at least one feeder service departing from the interchange after the arrival of the last train;<br>All feeder services had an average scheduled headway of not more than 10 and 15 minutes during peak and off-peak periods, respectively;<br><br>More than 75 per cent of the trunk services had an average scheduled headway of not more than 10 minutes during the morning peak while more than 85 per cent of them had an average scheduled headway of not more than 15 minutes during off-peak periods;<br><br>and All infrequent services with scheduled headway more than 20 minutes had their timetable displayed at all bus stops along the routes.<br><br><span class="small">FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT THE <a href="http://www.ptc.gov.sg/nr10.htm" rel="nofollow">PTC WEBSITE</a>[/b]</span><br><br><span class="small">The above paragraphs are adopted from the PTC website.</span></div>
