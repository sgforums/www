              <p>2018 has come and this bus STILL couldn't feature a PIS and new doors. </p>

              <p>SMC Transit had the ability to provide automatic ramps, yet couldn't update its door design which has been in use since 15 years ago. Outdated, and more importantly, shown to be dangerously filmsy. </p>
              <p>LTA had it worse, to be oblivious, perhaps nonchalant even, to such a problem despite repeated chances to change the design.

              <p>Don't be deceived that innovation drives costs upwards. Costs are driven by the inadequate management of revenue and operation procedures. Such forms of innovation are not ground-breaking, they are CONVENTIONALLY AVAILABLE technologies that have long been adopted by many other countries, which means that these technologies are not patented or sparse in supply, assuming demand drives supply. As such, these technologies would not necessitate a huge surge in costs to acquire. </p>
              <p>Dont ger me wrong, the new design looks stunning and many other features are still added. However, I still hope this bus will lose out to the A95 and be rejected. That is, until LTA realises the great potential of this make and really fix the long revolving problems. </p>

              <p>This clearly shows the failure and inefficiency of the LTA in its schemes. More importantly, it reflects how things by LTA never lasts long, and the things LTA do never sustain.</p>
              <p>Regarding the doors it's either you are missing the point, or you are being plain snide with your sarcastic remarks. Either way, I'll take you on your best and reiterate once more: it's 2018, and any new makes of buses, particularly this BRAND NEW B8L, deserves some new door model. </p>
