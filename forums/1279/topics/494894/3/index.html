              <p>It was a mistake to buy 3-axle buses through, but nevermind 3-axle buses should be made optional. 2-axle buses as a non-aircon, is still a norm but with openable windows for ventilation like London and Hong Kong MTR's trains.</p>

              <p>There is nothing wrong with the Volvo D8K engine in a city bus context.  It is a perfectly suitable engine with more than enough nominal power and torque output, smooth and brisk power delivery under transient conditions, great fuel economy and low noise output.  Peak power and torque only tells you part of the story so until you understand the physics behind this, please refrain from making generalisations.  The 350 PS version of this engine is more than capable of powering a fully laden articulated bus in hilly topography with good driveability given appropriate axle gearing and engine/gearbox mapping.  Speaking from personal experience.</p>
