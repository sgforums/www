              <p><strong>I don't want to whack on this, but the clones have seriously been irritating us since February 2012. I also brought up this topic because of the sudden change in userID "Boeing 787 L0VUR's" typing style or whatsover.</strong></p>
              <p>From what I observed in SGF and Facebook, I can say that both Mark(BIS) and Rachel might actually be innocent.</p>
              <p>I suspect that this SMB228X guy might be one of those SPT kids or even people who know Mark and Rachel well. Because of something that probably happened in the past between this SMB228X and BIS, SMB228X is currently creating lots of clones and posting negative info to sabotage the Singapore Buses community.</p>
              <p>1. As you can see, SMB388S, which is one of 228's clones, is posting information about Buses[IN]gapore! in SGForums, but I think that he is trying to make Mark look stupid by so-called advertising him and accusing other users of being the mastermind.</p>
              <p>2. I also thought that this "Jason Lim WD" account is not created by Rachel, but rather 228 himself. There was also one incident where he used Gus.chong's name to create a clone and pushing the blame to him for being the mastermind. Similarly, we can assume that this person knows Rachel well, as 228 used Rachel's brother's name to create another clone.</p>
              <p>Jason Lim WD and Boeing 787 L0VUR are those that pretend to scold 388S and his gang, and also users like dan474, SMB66X and TIB868X which have done nothing wrong. I suspect that 228 might be doing this in order to conceal his identity and also somehow twist the facts around to confuse people about the events. There was even once that Jason Lim WD alerted FireIce to ban SMB228X, simply because they had to sacrifice one clone account in order to make people believe the fake story and to accuse Rachel.</p>
              <p>I can assume that Jason Lim WD is not Rachel, because SMB228X somehow changed his tactics by changing the typing style of Boeing 787 L0VUR to a one that is similar to Jason Lim WD's typing style (that is to scold 388S). Therefore, it can be assumed that SMB228X was the one who created the Jason Lim WD account using another person's name, since he knew what writing style to use.</p>
              <p>3. There was also a recent case of 228 sabotaging Singapore Buses Admin Asri(SMB92U) by accusing him of creating the clone accounts just because of what happened in the past.</p>
              <p>4. There was also an incident in the past where Jason Lim WD tried to defame our moderator ^tamago^ by saying that he did not moderate well and allowed the clones to continue causing unrest in SGF. There was also a very recent post by SMB388S, which is... "Fire the mod and allow BIS to take over the forum!". In this case, he is also humiliating Mark using the advertising tactic. It can also be assumed that 228 was one of the few people who knew about the incident about our moderator that happened about 3-4 years ago.</p>
              <p>5. Lastly, I think this 228 is trying to sabotage the whole Singapore Buses community by somehow "advertising" BIS in a negative way and also tried to defame other pages that he thought was inferior to BIS, such as Singapore Buses, also by posting the recent Singapore Buses case involving Asri in SGF. Yup, that's the screenshot that contained "COME I CLAP FOR YOU".</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Don't ask me anything about the past events, because I have no idea what exactly happened, but I do know that this 228 is using various tactics to mislead us and giving us the false information by cloning in SGF.</span></p>
