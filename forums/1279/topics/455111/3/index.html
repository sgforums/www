              <p>The KMB accident was poor speed control, same as the Scania accident at HMV..</p>
              <p>So if you want bus that can pick up fast, dun try in SG or HK... In case later flip or head tail on collision as you cannot brake in time...</p>

              <p>Dunno how to drive = think speeding and accleration is important..</p>
              <p>Know how to drive = priority of keeping everyone safe, keep proper lookout for hazard slow down if necessary...</p>

                              a nuisance as well. And they road hog too much, imagine a emergency

                              bus to cut lane before it can move forward??? If ambulance, I think
                              the casualty will have to wait long (or can wait) before

              <p>- Please think. Our roads, infrastructures, density living
                              cannot support such long buses in the long run. Yes, each kind of
                              buses, SDs, DDs and bendies will have their short comings. But we
                              must understand that our land and infrastructures are limited and
                              the population is still growing. We have to choose the better
                              options to solve the problem, not choosing something that gives
                              much more problems.</p>

              <p><br>You seems to be running away from the problem and the fact that bendies don't fit ur roads. Now the ministers have identified that long buses like bendy buses are deemed not suitable for our land scare space and thus identified this problem in their reports. </p>
              <p>LTA have also make this point clear that 12m buses are the way to go in future based on the designs of new bus interchanges and bus stops and not encouraging more long queues to defeat the efficiency of bus services if they have to add more buses on the roads in the next few years.</p>
              <p>Thus if you can't accept the fact that bendy buses are not suitable here, then don't hinder the authorities in their way to provide better and more efficient bus services by using only 12m buses in future. They had already recognised the problem, accepted the fact, and choose a better option of all 12m buses and move on to the future. But you don't.</p>

              <p><br> You seems to be running away from the problem and the fact that
                  bendies don't fit ur roads. Now the ministers have identified that
                  long buses like bendy buses are deemed not suitable for our land
                  scare space and thus identified this problem in their
                  reports. </p>
              <p>LTA have also make this point clear that 12m buses are the way
                  to go in future based on the designs of new bus interchanges and
                  bus stops and not encouraging more long queues to defeat the
                  efficiency of bus services if they have to add more buses on the
                  roads in the next few years.</p>
              <p>Thus if you can't accept the fact that bendy buses are not
                  suitable here, then don't hinder the authorities in their way to
                  provide better and more efficient bus services by using only 12m
                  buses in future. They had already recognised the problem, accepted
                  the fact, and choose a better option of all 12m buses and move on
                  to the future. But you don't.</p>

              <p>1. COI identifies bendies as a significant factor behind the poor response to the breakdowns.</p>
              <p>2. COI figures that SMRT never thought that the breakdowns would ever be this serious and therefore had little preparation and plans in the event.</p>
              <p>3. LTA was deemed to be less than strict with SMRT.</p>

              <p>With or without cars, you still fail to see that bendies are still a problem to other public buses and not just other vehicles. How about bus interchanges, bus depots, bus bays and only buses bus lanes where there are no other vehicles on the roads??? Lesser cars won't solve the problem anyway since in the first place bendies themselves are already creating problems for other buses in bus interchanges and bus stops.</p>
              <p>It is the design of the bus stops, bus interchanges and how efficient these infrastructures should work to provide a better bus service. LTA can create a bus only lane but bendy buses will still hog the road space of other buses and create long queues along bus lanes which LTA do not encourage at all. What is the point of running half empty bendy buses all the time which hogs the roads and cause more inefficiencies for the whole bus system???<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>And if lesser cars, means lesser roads, which means even more no bendies should be allowed but for more normal 12m buses for more bus services to cater for the increasing crowds. </p>
              <p>BCs are also getting fed up with these bendies hogging the space in bus interchanges, bus bays and bus lanes. Passengers are also fed up when their buses behind couldn't board because the bendy bus hog the whole bus stop and have to wait for it to leave before their bus goes in the bus bay/bus stop.</p>
              <p>They don't just jam CBD roads but also crowded suburban centrals. Go observe how bendies managed to create jams in bus interchanges in Yishun and Woodlands at different times and sent other BCs behind honking away while trying to move.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"></p>
              <p>Trailer trucks and bendies works differently even they take up a lot of space. Trailer trucks goes from point A to B non stop to deliver goods or park, that's all. And trailer trucks have other limitations on going on certain roads.</p>
              <p>Bendy buses are much different, they stop and go, stop and go at every bus stop and so their frequencies and chances of obstructing the traffic of other road users are much higher. And such obstructions causes the bendy buses to move more slowly, takes up more time of other buses and also waiting times for other passengers with all the jams and queues created in bus stops and bus interchanges.</p>

              <p>No, I'm not (running away from the facts), But you failed to realize this kind of situations are the same, with or without bendies. Find the reports for me, And as usual no proof no talk.</p>
              <p>Ok, fine, report then(about LTA saying 12M buses)? One thing I far as I am concerned, No evidence no talk, or a PR as proof.</p>

              <p>Report has already presented to you on the first page and you don't bother to read or just can't accept the fact.</p>
              <p><br>Have LTA tried without bendies on the roads yet??? And not yet and going to, so how do you know that the situation will be the same??? The most likely situation that it will be improved when there are no bendies on the roads in future. Before the bendy buses were even introduced and during MRT era, there wasn't so much problems like long bus queues and messy buses trying to cut each other lane.</p>
              <p>I agree that let SMRT to decide themselves but LTA should have already gave them a hint to switch to 12m double deckers in future under the tables, which SMRT will cooperate with them instead of making the worst mistake like TIBS getting bendies. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_down.png" alt="thumbs_down.png"> </p>
