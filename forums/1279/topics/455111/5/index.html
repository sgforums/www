              <p>You can't say that bendies are bad just because they cannot turn at AMK or Bishan... nor can u say that just because it affects bus bridging... whatever it takes, SMRT or even LTA should keep bendies and have WAB bendies for the INTRATOWN svc.

              <p><br>No.  Just stop buying bendies. They are not suitable for our roads. Not just bus bridging services, evgen normal services they already hog too much spaces along bus stops and bus lanes, bus interchanges and depots as well.</p>
              <p>Poor SMRT have to park some of their buses outside their depots just because of bendy buses. Ridiculars. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>Looking at the pages of the long discussions, I have to agree that bendy buses have to go soon to make way for a better public bus system in Singapore in future. Although I don't hate these buses, but the problems of everyday operations caused by these buses truthfully reflects on what some of the members have mentioned. If LTA stops the use of bendy buses in future, it certainly will help to solve many problems caused by bendy buses which makes the job easier for LTA to plan and schedule current and more new bus services in future. Thus removing bendies for the long run will be better option if LTA wants to improve bus services for the years to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, what's the point of debating pages and pages of what kind of buses SMRT should use in future? SMRTB should just wind up and concentrate fully on rail business. The bus operations should be given to SBST or another bus operator like KMB and cab operations to Transcab. And SMRT Corp should be delisted from SGX until they can improve their rail operations in a proper manner and bring in profits. The recent punishment for SMRT is too light for such continuous major disruptions for the MRT. They should heavily penalise the company due to its negligence over its maintainance and upgrading of its rail fleets and infrastructures all the years, by giving all free rides for a week, beacuse fines alone are practically useless.</p>
              <p>Buy double deckers, so what? Buy bendy buses, so what? They can't even give a basic proper maintainance of their bus fleets, which are dirty, run down and poor conditions as a whole. Bus services standards are poor, long and irregular frequencies, overcrowded buses, reckless drivings, etc. Given whatever kind of buses to this company, they just screw up everything. They hardly improve, despite so many years and can't be bother to till now. This kind of company should have gone long ago, as they are wasting commuters' and taxpayers' monies. The earlier they close down, the better for the commuters to have other choices of other better bus companies out there.</p>
              <p>Wastage of bandwith to discuss such things here, especially about SMRT.</p>

              <p>Ha, you are a bit too harsh on this. But you certainly made some points valid here.</p>
              <p>But then no need SMRT to close down. I think this is the best time that SMRT should improve their bus services, by: stop buying bendy buses and switch to double deckers. I firmly believe that switching to double deckers, SMRT bus operations will definately be much smoother and better than now, with lesser jams and queues and more space to park more buses, which in turn, better frequencies for their services. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, just let the bendy buses serve their 17 years lifespan till scrap and no more of these dreadful buses.</p>

With a DD, these 90 passengers can all be comfortably seated and there are still surplus of seating and standing place</p>

              <p>Rather than waste money to buy a expensive citaro to pack the
              passengers like sardin</p>
              <p>may as well go for a NAC DD, larger capacity and more passengers
              can sit comfortably at the top deck.</p>
              <p>NAC buses save energy and electricity also and don't pollute the
              atmosphere</p>
              <p>depends how you define comfort</p>
              <p>to me, comfort is not aircon...comfort is space...more sitting
              space more comfortable</p>
              <p>got aircon..but still have to squeeze squeeze in tight
              space..also no use...movement so restricted..passengers say "excuse
              me?! excuse me!", still have to make way for them if obstruct
              them..want to sneeze and yawn also paiseh...very
              uncomfortable...look at the morning crowd and you will
              understand...squeeze until kiss the front door</p>

              <p>You can't say that bendies are bad just because they cannot turn

              bridging... whatever it takes, SMRT or even LTA should keep bendies
              and have WAB bendies for the INTRATOWN svc. For 169 it would be
              either DD or 2-for-1 replacement.</p>

              <p>For once, I agree with you. Just because bendies can't turn at some parts of AMK and bishan doesn't mean they are bad. Feeders like 800 804 etc needs them, So does services which are in high demand like 106 and 190, just to name a few. For 969 they should make one of it full day whereas for 169 3 is enough.</p>
