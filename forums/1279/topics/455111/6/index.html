              <p>Rather than waste money to buy a expensive citaro to pack the passengers like sardin</p>
              <p>may as well go for a NAC DD, larger capacity and more passengers can sit comfortably at the top deck.</p>
              <p>NAC buses save energy and electricity also and don't pollute the atmosphere</p>
              <p>depends how you define comfort</p>
              <p>to me, comfort is not aircon...comfort is space...more sitting space more comfortable</p>
              <p>got aircon..but still have to squeeze squeeze in tight space..also no use...movement so restricted..passengers say "excuse me?! excuse me!", still have to make way for them if obstruct them..want to sneeze and yawn also paiseh...very uncomfortable...look at the morning crowd and you will understand...squeeze until kiss the front door</p>

              <p>Last time because of MRT, buses have to go air con. If not, at least 99% of Singaporeans will either complain or take MRT only. Then bus will lose business. That's why bus services have to change in the 1990s to have air con buses.</p>
              <p>Comfort is space, but how much space do we have now to be comfortable??? With the population keep on increasing every year, you see more and more traffic jams, more and more people taking buses and MRTs. More and more people squeezing into a bus than what is in the 1980s. So how to have more space if more people squeeze in the bus and you know how hot it can be when squeezing with so many people in a NAC bus??? Now is not about the bus designs but it is about how much more people are squeezing in a bus nowadays. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>Please go and take bus more often.</p>
              <p>I am also living in the era of non air con buses when young, taking all kinds of NAC buses before like Volvo B57, Mercedes Benz OF 1413 and OF1417, Leyland Victory, Albion Viking, Mercedes Benz O305, Leyland Atlanteans, etc, etc. I will surely miss the NAC as well when they are gone next year. But you have to know this, times have change. If buses don't improve, they will be neglected one day. Instead of giving such suggestions that will not change, go cherish the rides of the last 30 NAC VO 2xes instead. 10 months is very fast.</p>

              <p>NAC DD passenger capacity is only about 80 to 90 passengers and they are only 10.6m long. The one you mentioned above is ADD (Air Con Double Decker), which is 12m long and can carry up to 131 passengers.</p>

Feeders like 800 804 etc needs them, So does services which are in high demand like 106 and 190, just to name a few. For 969 they should make one of it full day whereas for 169 3 is enough.</p>

              <p><br>No.  Just stop buying bendies. They are not suitable for our roads. Not just bus bridging services, evgen normal services they already hog too much spaces along bus stops and bus lanes, bus interchanges and depots as well.</p>

              <p>Ha, you are a bit too harsh on this. But you certainly made some points valid here.</p>
              <p>But then no need SMRT to close down. I think this is the best time that SMRT should improve their bus services, by: stop buying bendy buses and switch to double deckers. I firmly believe that switching to double deckers, SMRT bus operations will definately be much smoother and better than now, with lesser jams and queues and more space to park more buses, which in turn, better frequencies for their services. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>
              <p>Meanwhile, just let the bendy buses serve their 17 years lifespan till scrap and no more of these dreadful buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The SMRT Ah Kong still want to destroy the bus services??? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p>Want to be different, then get Alexander Dennis Enviro 500 or Scania K320UDs with Gemilang body (like to SBST one), look so modern or even MAN.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT is considering converting their fleet to full single decker fleet to improve bus frequencies in future, as they want to fully utilise their resources and space in depots for more buses. So bendy bus will at most serve till their lifetime expiry and no more of bendy buses. Services like 67, 190 and 960 won't need bendy bus once DTL is up in a few years, so at most full single deckers fleet is sufficient. </p>

              <p>SMRT should just scrap all their bendies in 2 years time.Buy 300 DDs and 450 more SDs if they're serious about buses.Its just wasted to refurbish those old non WAB buses.O405s are ardy 17 years and the return of investment they ardy get eons ago.Why bother to refurbish those old buses when LTA implemented WAB?</p>

              <p><br>The last batch of bendy buses have 5 years to go. Scrap all of them now is quite a waste. Just scrap them batch by batch. If SMRT is really serious about double deckers, they should buy them by early next year to replace the batch 1 MK1 bendy buses. And scrap and replace progressively batch by batch.</p>

              <p>I just read the COI report.</p>
              <p>Given LTA way of doing things, they are already planning and hinting SMRT what to improve in future.</p>
              <p>However if SMRT is still persisitant in its own ways and old ways of management, and continues to use bendy buses, then so be it. It is a matter of time that more problems on its bus business will surface in future, which eventually at a state that will make SMRT have no choice but to give up its bus operations.</p>
              <p>The recent spite of rail breakdown incidents and countless of complains about SMRT buses and cabs have shown that the old mangement have totally failed to bring SMRT to provide a basic decent business for all these years and result cans of worms to be opened again and again. Unless SMRT do away the old style of mangement and thinking, else this company won't survive for long and better off close down.</p>

              <p><br>SMRT is considering converting their fleet to full single decker fleet to improve bus frequencies in future, as they want to fully utilise their resources and space in depots for more buses. So bendy bus will at most serve till their lifetime expiry and no more of bendy buses. Services like 67, 190 and 960 won't need bendy bus once DTL is up in a few years, so at most full single deckers fleet is sufficient. </p>
