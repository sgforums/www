              <p>But this is not what LTA wants, since they have identified the problem and they want to solve the problem, for the future, in line with the increasing population and limited land space and more bus services in future.

              <p>Type of buses used also determine the results of proper planning and scheduling of bus services to improve them. Too much queues and jams in bus interchanges and bus stops creates more inefficiencies for better bus services and bendy buses are the main culprits of such problems.</p>
              <p>You said they are constantly changing what kind of buses they use and this is exactly what they are doing. This is not 1996 anymore but 2012. They have to change the kind of buses used based on limited land space, increasing number of buses and efficiencies of the bus system. That's why they pharsed out midi buses because they are not efficient anymore to carry heavier loadings. Same goes to bendy buses, since they are not as efficient as 12m buses.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, Even with no bendies it doesn't make a difference. Jams will still happen, and people will still complain. They want solve problems, yes, and no, I'm not creating problems but I still maintain my stand that these buses doesn't pose enough hazard to deserve the boot out of our roads. Even though it might be a bit of fuss, but it isn't hazardous enough to be kicked out of our roads. I firmly believe our LTA is fair and square. So long it doesn't cause hazard to us as road users, They will be flexible and allow it on our roads. Having bendies or not, It doesn't make a difference. Jam-prone areas are simply unavoidable and it do happen in our everyday life.</p>
              <p>I still firmly believe these bendies are faultless. And no bus interchanges are queue-less and non-jam prone. These things do happen everyday, It doesn't matter whose fault it belongs to, No-one can expect the interchanges to be jam-free during peak hours.</p>
              <p>And finally, yes, But what I meant was 'they will remove a bendy for rigid' if they don't feel the demand there. And, Whether or not we will see bendies still remains to be seen.</p>

              <p>You still don't see the difference. As I have to say again, what you believe isn't what LTA wants.</p>
              <p>Just take a comparison between a busy bus interchanges like Boon Lay and Woodlands. Buses in Boon Lay bus interchange can move in and out freely without any jams or long buses blocking the ways and exits of other buses behind. However just look at buses in Woodlands interchange, long bus queues created because bendy buses takes up to much space in the berth, causing other buses to stuck inside the berth just because the trailer part blocks the path of the exiting bus. And thus BCs behind have to honk and honk and some overtake dangerously just to keep clear of these buses. And according to LTA, bendy buses have the highest accident rates as compared to SDs and DDs.</p>
              <p>Yes, jams in bus interchanges are inevitable in bus interchanges and bus stops. Thus the problem of bus jams and queues can be greatly reduced if there are no long bendy buses blocking the way, hogging the space and cause even longer queues and jams behind. If bendies can be removed to reduce jams greatly, it will certainly make bus scheduling much easier and efficient and reduce jams and queues greatly, even they can't be eliminated totally. And bus interchanges are getting smaller and more buses to be added in future, so it is simply impractical to waste the spaces to park these bendies instead where 12m buses can do the same job hogging lesser spaces. </p>
              <p>Your theory doesn't make the problem improves but continues to make it worse. It is like when a pipe burstes with a hole, you just plug it with a tape, instead of welding or changing a new pipe.</p>

              <p><br>You have already said that the problem exist in peak hours and thus LTA's purpose is to improve the efficiency of the bus system during peak hours. Removing bendies will really improve the jam and queue conditions during peak hours and that is one of the goals that LTA needs to do for the future to improve the bus services efficiency.</p>
              <p>And it is pointless to use bendies during off peak hours when most of them are half empty and yet takes up so much space in interchanges, depots and bus stops when these spaces can be used more efficiently for other uses like parking more buses for more services instead.

              <p>Your insistence of having bendies doesn't solve much problems, ut more like avoiding the problem and creating more problems. LTA is to solve the problems as the bus system as a whole, not to solve the problems for bendy buses. And if they are not suitable in terms of space and operational efficiency, they will have to go sooner or later.</p>

              <p>I still believe bendies should be deployed as full days if the demand is still there, Like 67,169,854,960,962 etc, They have full day bendies running around because the demand is there. Removing them would not work as I firmly believe not all like 962 are short distanced. Having bendies would be good over DDs which some roads does not fit. As for 67,854 and 960 they are unavoidable because these areas gets hot up during peak and it can't be helped. On other situations they are doing fine and won't cause any trouble.</p>
              <p>No, I don't think I'm running away from it, But I'd rather face it than to have it removed from our roads. Yes they will go, I believe these bendies, in one way or another do help with the loads.</p>

              <p>Just to say, for those interested in planning, dun just micro the things up, look at the broader perspective. The world dun just evolve around the bus stops w/ more alighting cos where these ppl board the bus in e first place?</p>

              <p>Looking at the pages of the long discussions, I have to agree that bendy buses have to go soon to make way for a better public bus system in Singapore in future. Although I don't hate these buses, but the problems of everyday operations caused by these buses truthfully reflects on what some of the members have mentioned. If LTA stops the use of bendy buses in future, it certainly will help to solve many problems caused by bendy buses which makes the job easier for LTA to plan and schedule current and more new bus services in future. Thus removing bendies for the long run will be better option if LTA wants to improve bus services for the years to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, what's the point of debating pages and pages of what kind of buses SMRT should use in future? SMRTB should just wind up and concentrate fully on rail business. The bus operations should be given to SBST or another bus operator like KMB and cab operations to Transcab. And SMRT Corp should be delisted from SGX until they can improve their rail operations in a proper manner and bring in profits. The recent punishment for SMRT is too light for such continuous major disruptions for the MRT. They should heavily penalise the company due to its negligence over its maintainance and upgrading of its rail fleets and infrastructures all the years, by giving all free rides for a week, beacuse fines alone are practically useless.</p>
              <p>Buy double deckers, so what? Buy bendy buses, so what? They can't even give a basic proper maintainance of their bus fleets, which are dirty, run down and poor conditions as a whole. Bus services standards are poor, long and irregular frequencies, overcrowded buses, reckless drivings, etc. Given whatever kind of buses to this company, they just screw up everything. They hardly improve, despite so many years and can't be bother to till now. This kind of company should have gone long ago, as they are wasting commuters' and taxpayers' monies. The earlier they close down, the better for the commuters to have other choices of other better bus companies out there.</p>
              <p>Wastage of bandwith to discuss such things here, especially about SMRT.</p>

              <p>Another hint,Why SMRT didn't wanna buy or even trial a WAB bendy
              although there are offers from both MAN &amp; MB?By right they
              should have at least quarter to meet WAB standards but chose to
              refurbish their old bendies.These are hint themselves are not
              interested in bendies too due to space problem at their depot.My
              SMRT friend was keen in trial a few DDs but still waiting for
              approval from SMRT Ah Kong cause Ah Kong want to be diff from
              SBST.I even suggest him the 3 door Lion City Dd but unfortunately
              it's not available for RHD.Who knows they be getting 2 axles DDs in
              future??</p>

              <p>Now now....why did you bother to bring that up to these people.....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>As for SMRT giving up its bus business, that is something that should be done.</p>
              <p>Not the least because control over buses AND rail clearly has led to serious conflicts of interest.</p>
              <p>Think left pocket, right pocket.</p>
              <p>Worst of all, if competition means being "different" to help consumer loyalty, I would rather we just have a single company.</p>

              <p>If so, SBS Transit should give up its NEL rail also?</p>

              <p>more Non aircon buses pls</p>
              <p>Like it or not, healthy senior folks believe that it's healthier to inhale natural air instead of articifial air (aircon)</p>
              <p>All those perfumes/deodorants in an enclosed and congested aircon environment is actually bad for health in the long run....if younger generations believe it....but i doubt so</p>
