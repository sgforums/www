We are flexible. Actually if you tell us the problem about services 8 and 90, we can't do much also as many of us seldom take service 90 and thus don't really know the situation. What I suggest is that you can contact SBST or PTC and leave them to deal with it.<br><br>Also, SBST may have their reasons for doing so, before that getting special concession from PTC.</div>
