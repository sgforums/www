              Currently, public buses to CGA got to clear total 3 security checkpoints, travel up and down several ramps to Terminal 3, then T1, then T2; hence a waste of time and resources. And the current PTB got height &amp; space restrictions that prevent double-deckers and bendies from being deployed, and most airport routes are in high usage.
              
              I envisage a new, single Changi Airport bus terminal to serve all 3 terminals (and even the future 4th terminal), preferably being built next to the current MRT station. This terminal may be above ground, similar to the coach pickup points used for Singapore Airshow shuttles. This bus terminal must be able to accomodate double-deckers and bendies; layout can be something similar to HK Airport's AIRBUS/Cityflyer terminal but on smaller scale. Passengers from any airport terminal can just use the skytrain to get to this bus terminal/ MRT station.
              
              I think travel is also more convenient this way and bus operations becomes more efficient. Also, the security checkpoint can be cut down from 3 to 1, hence saving manpower, costs and also the bus travelling time.

              As a user myself, I'd prefer to take a skytrain to a central location, then hop onto the public buses at a single bus-stop/terminal. Preferably the new stop being built next to MRT stn and skytrain stn. 
                  
              I think taking a skytrain from other terminals to this proposed single-stop would reduce travel time as compared to getting onto the bus at T3, then have to go through T1 and T2 before looping back.
              
              Furthermore, we may get to have double-deckers on eg svc 24 to the new terminal, hence reducing crowding and more chance for a seat. Wouldn't this option be better overall?
              
              Also, the new terminal can be air-conditioned like the new interchanges, hence avoid breathing the exhaust fumes from the buses while waiting. Also, passengers need not cross the driveway to get to the queueing areas like now, which can be a little dangerous (esp elderly and kids).

              <p>Hmm, but have you thought of the staff at changi airport? The services are actually mostly used by the staff, although to a certain extent by minority of visitors and the rest of the public. If a centralized terminal/stop is implemented, it means all the workers who work at the various terminals need extra time and effort to walk to the terminal/stop after work where now they could simply board the bus below the terminals.</p>
              <p>It may take a while longer for the bus from T3 to get to T2, but the time is about 10 mins. Taking a skytrain from T3 to T2 w/ waiting time can already take longer than that. Fastest way from T3 to T2 is to walk thru the path above the train station and is about 5 mins from T3 to T2 vice-versa. Frankly, i do not really like to make use of the skytrain unless theres a need, because the waiting time and journey between terminals can easily take 10 mins.</p>
              <p>Also, i believe there is now a factor of choice for commuter, compared to a centralized terminal/stop because if you would like to get a confirmed seat, simply board at T3, and if you are looking to get home fast, then board at T2. </p>

              all 3 terminals (and even the future 4th terminal), preferably
              being built next to the current <span>MRT</span> station.
              This terminal may be above ground, similar to the coach pickup
              points used for Singapore Airshow shuttles. <strong>This bus terminal must
              be able to accomodate double-deckers and bendies; layout can be
              something similar to HK Airport’s <span>AIRBUS</span>/Cityflyer terminal but on smaller scale.
              Passengers from any airport terminal can just use the skytrain to
              get to this bus terminal/ <span>MRT</span> station.</strong></p>
              <p>I think travel is also more convenient this way and bus
              operations becomes more efficient. Also, the security checkpoint
              can be cut down from 3 to 1, hence saving manpower, costs and also
              the bus travelling time.</p>

              <p>HK they have one damn big one quite small. SG we have two big one medium. How? <br>HK they walk out of the airport terminal to get to the bus terminal, SG we do underground, save trouble. <br>HK they got too many doubledecks, bo pian do open. SG too many single decks. Underground-wise, single decks better.</p>
              <p>I shot out three questions. conclusion: keep it this way.</p>
              <p>CGA staffs, Singaporeans, maybe some tourists if they know how to take bus, uses the bus terminal. You learnt about gravity right? It's better to walk downwards than talk upwards, upwards need more force.</p>
