              <p>151 doesn't need any more DDs. Here's why:</p>
              <p>Wed, I took 74 to meet a friend at serangoon north, and then proceeded to Bukit Timah to switch to 151 at 9+.</p>
              <p>True to form, there wasn't any need to wait for the 151 when we alighted, 2 buses came immediately.</p>
              <p>Observation 1: The 2nd bus was a DD. No big deal. Except its EMPTY.</p>
              <p>Observation 2: 'EMPTY' pretty much described the bus I took as well.</p>
              <p>My friend's look was priceless since she had been hearing horror stories about crowded buses.</p>
              <p>And again, true to form, only 2 stops later, our dear BC forgot about the bus-stopping AGAIN.</p>
              <p>Friggin bus stopped right in the middle of nowhere when the pax pressed the bell repeatedly and yelled. My friend's eyes bulged at that.</p>
              <p>I dunno about 151 in the early mornings, since I take 151 only from 8am onwards, but the above scene plays out everyday while the folks at HG are subject to long waiting times. In short, what 151 really needs more IMO, is better smoothing out of operations, NOT more DDs.</p>
              <p>And 151 BCs should wake up their idea with regards to the bus-stopping. Its very irritating and stressful for the pax to keep worrying about whether the bus will stop and for the rest of us who are subjected to e-braking.</p>

              <p>there's a DD that downroutes at 0937hrs every morning. its earlier trip departed hougang at 0725hrs. just nice hit the 9am crowd at NUS/NP.</p>

              <p>You would be thinking 9+AM would have less people. Yes and no. No, because of the uncooperative nature of 151 in the mornings as far as leaving HG is concerned.</p>
              <p>909E arrived 10 min later to pick us all up. Here's the all too familiar scene that should not be by the 4th bus-stop or so:</p>
              <p><img src="http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr311/SBS1908B/DSC00436.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>HG peeps are suffering needlessly because buses are doing downroutes, and IMO, too much of it.</p>
              <p>Why I say so?</p>
              <p><img src="http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr311/SBS1908B/DSC00445.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>Look at what happens when 151's DD leaves HG Int at 8AM sharp (peak hour and associated peak hour crowd, wait....where's the crowd?).</p>
              <p>And in case you were going to tell me, the BC would amble along and then the people would soon appear, yes and no again. No, again because the schedule is screwed-up.</p>
              <p>When 7383A did manage to pull a distance from the other full-route in front by quite a distance, this was negated instantly by 2679E making a U-turn at BTC and starting its down-route there.</p>
              <p>*facepalm*</p>
              <p>Which begs the question, why did the DD even start the route only 30 seconds after the previous full-route left?</p>

              <p><br>Actually, why I brought it up here, instead of to SBST, is because I have seen so many people complain from the scene, to the SBST hotline, and yet the same thing repeats again and again.</p>
              <p>And I am unsure what the loading for 151 is like in the early mornings before 8am. Because if its before 8am, I would have opted for 151e already.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as stated, its not whether there is DD or not. The problem lies with the resources being diverted to the downroutes and a consequent terrible frequency from HG.</p>
              <p>Its also not helpful when the BCs themselves sabo each other.</p>
              <p>A few days ago, my 151 started at 1045AM and reached Kent Ridge at 1150AM, which was a fantastically fast ride. BC wasn't really chionging. What happened was that the earlier full route 151 was taking its own sweet time and we managed to catch up with it at NUS.</p>
              <p>Considering the earlier one leaves HG at around 1030AM, this was no mean feat. But the BC who drove this bus was actually so slow at NUS that my BC honked at him. When that received no response, he let us all off before the hump before Central Library, and once he got rid of us, he pulled alongside the 151 in front and presumbly screwed him upside down for blocking the road.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, why I brought it up here, instead of to SBST, is because I have seen so many people complain from the scene, to the SBST hotline, and yet the same thing repeats again and again.</p>
              <p>And I am unsure what the loading for 151 is like in the early mornings before 8am. Because if its before 8am, I would have opted for 151e already.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as stated, its not whether there is DD or not. The problem lies with the resources being diverted to the downroutes and a consequent terrible frequency from HG.</p>
              <p>Its also not helpful when the BCs themselves sabo each other.</p>
              <p>A few days ago, my 151 started at 1045AM and reached Kent Ridge at 1150AM, which was a fantastically fast ride. BC wasn't really chionging. What happened was that the earlier full route 151 was taking its own sweet time and we managed to catch up with it at NUS.</p>
              <p>Considering the earlier one leaves HG at around 1030AM, this was no mean feat. But the BC who drove this bus was actually so slow at NUS that my BC honked at him. When that received no response, he let us all off before the hump before Central Library, and once he got rid of us, he pulled alongside the 151 in front and presumbly screwed him upside down for blocking the road.</p>

              <p>Then since you have all the pictorial proofs plus the timings, and descriptions of the crowd and irregularities, might as well email to them and show them the proof. Using hotline isn't particularly useful as there is nothing to show them as proof. Thus it is very hard for them to relate the incidents through phone and they may just take it as a minor complain.</p>
              <p>Maybe after looking at the empty double decker picture, they might think and review their resources allocation and timings.</p>
