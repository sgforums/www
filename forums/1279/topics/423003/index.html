              <p>This is HG Int on a typical morning at 0825. I was standing in line waiting for 151 as usual. Someone please justify how such a queue is even possible for this relatively low demand sector of the 151 route (relative to Toa Payoh - Ngee Ann Poly stretch)</p>
              <p>The only explanation was that the 151 frequency in the mornings is about 20 odd minutes.</p>
              <p>Next picture:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i495.photobucket.com/albums/rr311/SBS1908B/DSC00400.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>On board 918D at the 2nd stop. Bus was full by then and went on to skip the next few stops, much to the despair of those living in HG who badly needed the lift to work.</p>
              <p>And what happens when the bus reaches NUS? It arrived with 3 other 151s, all of which never started from HG. This is really nothing short of appalling IMO. One of them started from Macpherson area, while others probably started from Toa Payoh and Bukit Timah etc.</p>
              <p>BC slowed to crawl at Bukit Timah to reduce the bunching up, but that wasnt simply possible with all of that happening. So 151 has a strange paradox of chionging at off peak hour and crawling at peak hour, producing a variability in route time of 50 minutes to 2 hr 15 minutes (jam included).</p>
              <p>I might also add 151 has a horrible record of missing stops. Case in point: Today, this woman pressed the bell and stood at the exit. The bus slowed........................and went past the bus-stop. She screamed at the BC but he went on the next stop along the expressway, some distance away!</p>
              <p>This scene plays out about half my rides, I'm not exaggerating!</p>
              <p>In short: I really dunno what SBST is doing despite so many complaints about 151's frequency issues. Is it improving? It is. That much I acknowledge, but certain route sectors are clearly neglected.</p>

              <p><br>There <em>is</em> a downroute from before PIE. And in fact I'm not completely sure, but this particular one seems to start directly from HGDEP. On some days, despite the friggin 20+ min wait at HG Int, there will be a bunching up at Airport Rd. Conclusion drawn is very clear-cut that there is a downroute in that area.</p>
              <p>The next full route behind the 0825 one is another nightmare. I really regretted those 2 times when I still thought the bus would arrive at 0833 as I thought. The first time, I was late by 20 minutes because the bus left at 0850. The next incident lagi best. Should have known better. It did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> even arrive by 0855 and I gave up and took the train. And what traffic condition when we see at least 2 151s sitting in front of us on such occasions?</p>
              <p>Some pax took to calling SBST and complaining on the scene on the phone, but I suspect that making noise isn't going to be helpful because I have already seen 3 such occasions already.</p>
              <p>By default, 893R starts from BTC every morning after its 151e journey. That one is the most fixed by schedule. The rest vary considerably in bus and not so much in timing.</p>

              <p>Let me put it abt e VO2x capacity aft looking at 179A ops.</p>
              <p>PM peak no issue cos SBS has begun doing 179A downroutes from 27231. But AM peak is always a prob cos like mentioned wait till 150 ppl to dispatch tat VO2x.</p>
              <p>Usually in no time e 2nd 179A VO3x gotta be dispatched. Ends up e so called brunching appears, 4 179/ 179A at NTU Lib 1 bus stop 27211. Buses gets stucked cos usually the entrance door is packed w/ standee, everyone from upper deck gotta wait till lower deck pax alight before they could. It could take a good 3 - 4 mins for a 179 bus to clear 27211 though it's AM peak.</p>
              <p>4 is cos of tis: 179 bus alrdy in bay, comes 2x 179A, behind another 179.</p>

              <p>151 doesn't need any more DDs. Here's why:</p>
              <p>Wed, I took 74 to meet a friend at serangoon north, and then proceeded to Bukit Timah to switch to 151 at 9+.</p>
              <p>True to form, there wasn't any need to wait for the 151 when we alighted, 2 buses came immediately.</p>
              <p>Observation 1: The 2nd bus was a DD. No big deal. Except its EMPTY.</p>
              <p>Observation 2: 'EMPTY' pretty much described the bus I took as well.</p>
              <p>My friend's look was priceless since she had been hearing horror stories about crowded buses.</p>
              <p>And again, true to form, only 2 stops later, our dear BC forgot about the bus-stopping AGAIN.</p>
              <p>Friggin bus stopped right in the middle of nowhere when the pax pressed the bell repeatedly and yelled. My friend's eyes bulged at that.</p>
              <p>I dunno about 151 in the early mornings, since I take 151 only from 8am onwards, but the above scene plays out everyday while the folks at HG are subject to long waiting times. In short, what 151 really needs more IMO, is better smoothing out of operations, NOT more DDs.</p>
              <p>And 151 BCs should wake up their idea with regards to the bus-stopping. Its very irritating and stressful for the pax to keep worrying about whether the bus will stop and for the rest of us who are subjected to e-braking.</p>

              <p>SBST should either introduce premium 151 from HG Int using DD at 30 mins frequency maybe from 7am to 11am.... only stop at certain stops in HG....</p>

              <p>there is already 151e.. unless u propose increasing the operating hours for 151e and putting DD on it with slight route adjustment to skip more stops?</p>
