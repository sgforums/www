Its fine if its played softly. But if its played loudly like radio, it becomes very irritating, especially when you are trying to catch some sleep before and after work. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't blame the guy. Anger problem is common, depending on the situation that provokes us to react with aggression. In this case, EZlink is a personal item considered by many. So judging from his reaction, he's protective of his own items because they are something private. So letting an outsider tactlessly or brainlessly snatch away his own belonging of course can result in the arousal of aggression! Simple cause and effect psychology no one even knows.. now I'm telling you all lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On the other hand, the bus driver has lousy attitude. I once encountered such bus drivers. I think too many already and I've lost count of them. When I was a teenager, I use thread to break the driver's legs when I see him one more time. But now, I've toned down. All I did was ignore them. One would even come all the way to the back seat where I was sitting and talk to me. I was like wtf??? Can you please carry on your job well and drive? I continued ignoring him, and in the end he bo bian have to drive the bus and not waste other people's time.<br><br>Can't imagine paying so much and yet getting some bus drivers who are incompetent and yet so "garang".<br><br>Oh by the way, I've to add: Sometimes, we forgot exactly how much we have in our EZlink card so by giving it a try on the buses, (beep-beep) no go!!. Nvm, we then check our wallets. No coins or lose change. So what now? Chase us out of the bus while the rest are waiting in the queue? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So lau kui (lose face).<br><br>There ought to be a solution to test EZlink's left over amount at the bus stop so that people can pay up efficiently rather than having fights like this.</div>
