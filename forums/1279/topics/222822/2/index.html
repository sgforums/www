It's not just an idea anymore; get into trouble, as long as you have tons of money, you grab the best (but warped) lawyer you can find to get your own ass out of hot soup, then scoot off with the most minimal or even no punishment.<br><br>This brings to mind another accident I read about. Can't remember much, but it said that someone failed trying to appeal his sentence in court. Apparently, he ran over a rich man who was jaywalking, and just because that dead person (and their family) is rich, the person who ran over him (who is actually quite poor) has to pay extravagant sums of money to their family. Someone's literally paying the price of a wrong of another person, just because he has the money.<br><br>Our moral, justice, and other timeless ethical values have become warped with money, selfishness, greed, and materialism...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Infantile:</div><div class="quote_body">yup.. he's better.. he is my friend.. seriously.. screw the driver.. to think he still can apologize  and run away after that.. he was in ICU yesterday.. he can't even speak yesterday and he had to use alphabets to tell us.. and he had a liver operation last night.. today when i visit him.. he's slight better.. can talk already..<br>glad that he's better.. hope he come out soon..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>My prayers and hopes go out to your friend; tell him to be strong, tell him that every sensitive soul who reads and knows about this feels for him.</div>
