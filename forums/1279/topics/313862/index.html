              <p>Sometimes yes... But even if the driver never does that, and I know that that particular service (For example Service 960) has a very poor frequency, I will just go in through the middle door no matter what... Whatever the driver scold or told me, I will just express my unhappiness feeling that we will not want to wait any longer for the next bus, for that next bus will have the same cycle as well... I don't think the driver wants to call OCC or what, to delay other people's time just because of that. Everyone wants to go home don't they?! How will the driver feels when he/she puts himself/herself to our dear poor commuters' shoes?!</p>

              <p><br>Just last Monday, I encountered a similiar situation at night on SBS2795C of Service 27 which I just went in through the exit door without hestitation and dashed all the way to the front to tap my card at Tampines towards Hougang, with ample space for me to walk through from the exit to the entrance door area when the commuters DIDN'T WANT to MOVE to the REAR... And somehow my conversation with the BC later on in Chinese was as follow:</p>

              <p><br>But in the case of such poor frequency, and that their buses are always jam packed at the entrance door, and that driver really don't want to care so much about asking people to move to the back, it's really time for us to tweak our brains, be flexible and do something else... We cannot just let this cycle goes on and on, and have more commuters suffer just because of that..</p>
              <p>And talking about evade fares, this is what the bus companies deserve if they provide bus services with lousy frequency when the demand is high... They themselves as the 2 main public transport operators (especially SMRT Buses), should really wake up their ideas when they have caused a lot of inconvenience and unhappiness among their fellow commuters when they want to encourage people to take public transport... Be flexible with their ideas if their commuters don't want to do something about it, such as the simple courtesy of moving towards the rear of the bus especially when the bus is fully packed with commuters..</p>

              <p>Of course I will not do that on all buses that are like that.. I also don't want to make myself look bad in front of the people that I know in public... That's why for now I only do it on Service 960 because by the time it reached Whitley Rd bus stop, the front portion of the bus will be filled with Indians, and I do not know them! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Services such as 187, 963 and 966 when I took it to Republic Poly everyday, I try my very best not to do that...</p>

              <p>In Beijing here, though the frequency is much better than singapore for quite a large number of routes, packed bus still occur, sometimes because people do not want to move in too. Most buses in beijing have a conductor on board so they will shout and shout fiercely for people to move in. Although most buses do not allow boarding from the back  door, some people will just squeeze in from the backdoor. Some of their NON WAB buses have lesser seats than our scania k230s also. Evading fare is not really an issue here as some conductors dont care when the bus is crowded and there are hundreds of ways to cheat fare, ranging from an adult using a student concession card (paying SGD 4 cents per 12km or less trip) and not tapping their card when they board for certain service where the driver is at the front door and the conductor is at the back door controlling traffic, where the driver think you will buy the ticket from the conductor and the conductor is unsure if u have tapped your card (For real crowded cases like 190 960 case)</p>

              <p>Just to add on, an interesting fact about Beijing buses is that for most of the bendy/artic buses, u have to board from the middle door and the conductors are there to collect the fare. The front exit is only for alighting. For rigids, its just like sg, mostly no conductor and the driver is there to collect the fare.</p>
