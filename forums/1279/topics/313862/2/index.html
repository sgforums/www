              <p>Just to add on, an interesting fact about Beijing buses is that
                  for most of the bendy/artic buses, u have to board from the middle
                  door and the conductors are there to collect the fare. The front
                  exit is only for alighting. For rigids, its just like sg, mostly no
                  conductor and the driver is there to collect the fare.</p>

              <p><br>In Switzerland, most commuters carry a bus pass and they would board the bus through any doors. You don't even have to show your pass to the driver. But if you think you can enjoy free rides, then you're doing it at your own risk. Uniformed and plainclothes inspectors check the buses regularly and you will have to show your pass/ticket without demand. If you don't have one, you will be fined. There's no escape because up to 3 inspectors will board the bus at once.</p>

              <p>Once I was at the Central Bus Station "touring" inside a Citaro G after getting permission from the driver. I wonder if he's getting heat stroke from the summer heat or what. When it's time for him to leave, he just closed to door and prepare to go off. I'm still halfway in and ran forward to tell him I need to get off. If I was on backpack travelling, maybe I could get a free ride inside Lucerne. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
