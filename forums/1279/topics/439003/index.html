              <p>6 months ago my family bought a new Mercedes Benz from Cycle &amp; Carriage. All was fine until the engine suddenly stalled 3 weeks after the collection of the vehicle. Since then the car had repeatedly stalled at least once every week. Luckily the stalling did not happen on the expressway. I can't imagine if it stalls suddenly on the expressway. Despite several visits to the agent service center, the problems were not solved. C&amp;C had promised us they will do a detailed check if the stalling continues.</p>
              <p>This is the first time my family owned a Mercedes Benz and this happened. Think we got a lemon car.</p>

              <p>Just to share.... my family owned a brand new W211 in 2003/4. Gave us so much problems.. evap core spoilt, intake value cracked, engine stalled, sensor spoilt... Of the 2.5 years we had the car.. 6 mths was spent in the C&amp;C workshop. We asked for replacement was denied, the GM say their policy is only to replace parts when its spoilt and will replace for free during warranty.. he told me some of the flaws were unique to South East Asia.. (Uniquely Singapore?)</p>
              <p>Naturally I asked him what are my options if the problems continue after warranty.. he simply said 'I'm sorry' with a straight face. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So we quickly get rid of the car before the warranty expired. Luckily there was enough value left to buy a Japcar without us paying anything... and  Jap car no issues... </p>
              <p>Guess suay its just another 4-letter word.</p>

              <p><br>I think someone else has kicked up a fuss, and had his car changed.</p>
              <p>Most dealers have a lemon somewhere, waiting for the uninitiated to come along.</p>
              <p>TS, should check that this car is not re-allocated to them from that someone else. The dealers only need to change the trip meter and the whole car can look like new with just less than 5km milage on it.</p>
              <p>Kick up a fuss, and have the car replaced. It is not easy to fix a fault like this because the car is working fine, until....., then it works fine again.</p>
              <p>For this kind of new car it is certainly not worth it, for you will be driving with uncertainity in your heart. A second hand car with great discount, you put up with it, but not with a new prestigious car.</p>
