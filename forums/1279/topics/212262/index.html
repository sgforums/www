            <div class='col-md body'>If I don't remember wrongly, in 1990, when the N113CRBs were first delivered, a few in the range of SBS3688Y - SBS3698T (then NAC) served on 81. Used to board them to Tampines Interchange.<br><br>Then when demand got higher with development along the route, 81 switched to using the LAs with Walter Alexander-L and Metal Sections and after their withdrawal, Walter Alexander-R bodywork.<br><br>Of course, then came the inevitable tide of air-con buses and I think O405 OACs (Those with Sutrak A/Cs) served on 81 for a while.<br><br>And of course, the LO3x came along, the MKIIIs and then, the VO3x (batch 2), and now, the mix of VO3x, DM3500, Striders and VSOs.<br><br>Used to ride on SBS0591L to school most mornings for a year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just a little nostalgia about the service that's been passing by the front of my house for abt 16 years now.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Remembered once when the present JB MKIII, so interestingly called, on svc 189, and CAC MKIIs WA bodied struggling up Toh Tuck Rd on svc 77. Once, the MKII was about 5-10km/h and cars queueing up behind. Engine at high rev noise.<br>Now the CAC MKIIs should be on Clementi services like 285, while the JB MKIII should be where they are, svc 160/170, sometimes on Express 506 also. Nostalgic, hmm...<br>Seen the development of 189 over 97-present day, seen the now JB MKIII, Striders, VO2X, then SMRT took over, 0405, 0405G Citaro (988H), Hinos, 905Y, then DAFs, and finally back to 0405 and now, Habits 1162S and 1224Y.<br>Development of svc 189 is something which I will continue over the years, hopefully as long as 20 years (2018 ). Maybe, eh...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Urroh:</div><div class="quote_body">how does NZMB bodied OF1417 and Guy Victories look like? </div></blockquote>The Guy Victory Mk II were introduced from 1975-78. There were 145 buses altogether. 20 of which (1977-7<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> were bodied by BACo and the rest by Soon Chow. The Victory had a Leyland O.680 engine, the same one as the Atlanteans, and a Leyland Pneumocyclic 4-speed semi-automatic gearbox. They had an overall length of 12.1 metres while seating arrangements varied from 41, 49 or 51 seats. All of the buses were based at Toa Payoh Depot (now BRAM). Hence, they received regos beginning with SBS 6XXX, as 6 was the code for Toa Payoh Depot.<br><br>One of my favourite buses of all, the Victory was quick, powerful and robust but it lacked considerably as far as passenger comfort was concerned. I loved watching the driver flicking the gears with one hand and holding on to the wheel with the other. Most drivers would 'flatchange', ie. changing gears without pausing, causing to bus to jerk and rattle violently as it gains speed. A heavyweight supremo, it certainly was a class above the lightweights Albions and Mercedes buses of that time.<br><br>In the mid-1980s, while SBS was experimenting with a few air-conditioned bus models, there was a project to convert the existing buses to become air-conditioned. The Leyland Victory was chosen because of its robustness and its high power output meant that it could deal with the added weight of an air-conditioner at the rear. I don't know how many buses were converted but the buses received an all new bodywork, built by Soon Chow from a Duple coach design. They rolled out in March 1989 on service 76 and it was known that services 3 and 390 had also used them at some point in time. By this time also, the Guy Victory were slowly being phased out and eventually the remainders were left to work on the Toa Payoh feeder services. The Victory were completely withdrawn by the mid-1990s.<br><br>Here is a picture of SBS 6668K.<br><a href="http://suhirman.fotopic.net/p8700121.html" rel="nofollow">http://suhirman.fotopic.net/p8700121.html</a></div>
