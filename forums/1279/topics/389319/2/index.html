              <p>If you owe 55 cents, you should pay 55 cents. If you don't have 5 cents, then just put 60 cents. No way should you underpay; it's as simple as that. 5 cents may not be a lot, but you are still cheating the bus company by paying 50 cents only. Besides, you are not going to die by paying 5 cents extra.</p>

              <p>many BCs know, but are sick and tired of making a fuss out of these recidivous and incorrigible singaporean students who evade the few cents. they are instead focusing on trying to make up with their schedules. majority of fare evaders according to BCs which i converse with are students clearly under the age of 20.</p>
              <p>just talk about drink cup incident on Service 38, the punching incident on Service 139. it clearly shows the preposterous behaviour of young people these days, and moral education in schools seem to be a utter failure mainly because we are getting too soft on these young reprobates. they should hung upside down on a tree along orchard rd for 3 hours a day wearing a shirt with the words "I eat and drink on the bus". "I cheated 5 cents out of a bus fare", thats what i call real wake up call punishment.</p>
              <p>i'm not pinpointing you whom i quote but a selective but growing number of illbred immature bunch of youngsters these days.</p>
              <p>i've seen it countless times, when commuters brings a cup filled with sweet drinks onboard, the BC tells them not to drink onboard and to dispose it properly, sometime get tired of even bothering when they know the end result.</p>
              <p>i dare say 75% of the time its found on the floor of the bus cabin and sometimes the drink is spilled out all over the floor or chairs (fryderyk). then, commuters complain there are cockroaches and pests. aren't you the ultimate culprits at the start. SMRT's initiative to get out and catch these, helps to contribute a much more comfortable and hygienic ride. don't always look at the side where they only want money la though its quite evident but look at the positives they get out of fining these perpertrators.</p>
              <p>there was once i saw a lady eating cai peng on the B9TL, eat until the floor also eating. then just throw the styrofoam box with the plastic bag on the seat then everyone just look at it and avoid it. i feel the courtesy campaign needs to make a reappearance man.</p>
