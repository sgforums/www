              <p>I'm not trying to side, but, try to be nice anyway. You may not like the person, but I feel we should be as neutral as possible, and try not to, er, veil things. Yep, that's it. Try and be impartial, or just say things outright. Though I may contradict myself at one point, anyway.</p>

              <p>A short review.</p>
              <p>Took it with my classmate from Yishun on the 11am+ trip. Configuration of the bus is simlar to Batch 2 K230s, just that  it has 4 seats at the back compared to the usual 5. Seat belts installed for the middle 2 seats in th last row. It was quite cramp seating at the last row.</p>
              <p>Seat colour: Red for the needy, light brown for the standard seats. The light brown colour was very plain and dull. You can hear noise when people position themselves on the seats. Haha.</p>
              <p>No interior rego. Some squeaking sounds when rear door functions. Interior as usual, looks very home made from China, got those ventilation windows, etc.</p>
              <p>Destination and service number on rear EDS, and can even scroll. Format is the same as the front side EDS. Number on the right. Which meas you see the same thing for front, side and rear. Wierd.</p>
              <p>ZF gearbox for sure. Sounds like OC or some say 8030L.</p>
              <p>Luckily not too much announcements along te way. The bus was not very quiet imo. Bus jerks when stops. Loud handbrakes (reminds me of bbdep buses).</p>
              <p>Out of 10, I would probably give a 6. I didn't really enjoy the ride. Haha.</p>

              <p>Took the bus today full trip from Yishun to Bedok.Many bus fans
              were onboard.Aircon not that good.Could barely feel the aircon at
              the rear and not much was coming out from the aircon duct.The rear
              seats gave this very funny squeaking sound when u made a slight
              movement.As mentioned by the others,the rear door gave a weird
              squeaking sound be4 it opened.Many people were openly gawking at
              the bus as it passed by them.Many SBST trainee BCs who were outside
              HGDEP pointed eargerly at the bus as it passed by.When it reached
              Bedok Int,a lot of the public were quite fascinated by the bus and
              even took pics of the front of the bus.When they saw people taking
              pics of the bus,many people got interested and stopped to watch the
              fun also.<img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="">Those who took the pics were those old uncles and just
              when they were taking the pics,a bird flew and landed on the front
              top of the Yutong making things even more funnier.<img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt=""><img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="">Overall the bus was like a famous star today.</p>

              <p>Nevermind, you'll get your chance to ride it soon enough. You still have, what, until 2026 to catch it? Not that it will take you that long ^_^ Maybe the bus will cameo on a service near you!....wherever you may be.</p>
