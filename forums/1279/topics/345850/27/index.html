              <p>If so, they would even take a TAXI, and wun take our buses. SMRT buses are so "failure" with DAFs on 927(on my latest 927 ride) So crowded....</p>

              <p><br>You gotta be kidding me.</p>
              <p>You really gotta try our neighbour up north as far as public transport is concerned.</p>
              <p>The buses there, when I toured were not crowded. Why?</p>
              <p>Because the buses were unreliable!</p>
              <p>Isn't that worse?</p>
              <p>There will always be budget tourists like me who had to try to bridge cultural differences, haggle with the bus uncle over the destination, and get stuck at the bus stop at midnight before realising the last bus must have left at least half an hour early.</p>

              <p><br>Errr can u explain clearly which part of the bus makes it look like it has been designed for the funerals?I think i understand why u are saying like that.For most of the funerals,it is those private china make buses that get chartered.Judging on that,since this is also a china bus,that is why u are saying that this bus also looks like its been designed for the funerals.</p>
