              <p>Ok. Yes, the bus did not do the first round trip but it was back in service by late morning. It is still in service in the evening. Which means the timing was changed for some unforeseen reasons.</p>

              <p>You must understand that this is a complete bus from Yutong. Meaning that the whole bus uses Yutong's brand. This isn't bought from chassis, the whole bus is just made from Yutong from the factory and shipped to Singapore. Thus, most likely most stuff are by Yutong.</p>

              <p>The bus is note by SMRT , it's almost a complete bus being shipped from china ... unless the chassis and bodywork is being brought over to singapore seperately . look at the doors , door alarm system , air-con vents , one look you should be able know ... all buses have air-con ducts , but Buses in China doesn't have air-con ducts . for the door , the control in underneath the bus unlike the normal plug doors . if SMRT do a little bit of amendment . The bus is perfectly fine .</p>

              <p>Err... I have no issues with the A/C. The air-con system it is using is similar to that of what the MRT uses - vents that provide adequate air flow into the bus instead of air-con ducts. If you have not realised, often people like to choke the air-con ducts with pieces of paper or wrappers and then the air flow is completely blocked. So isn't it better to have those small vents along the entire bus than those ducts?</p>
              <p>I personally prefer a continuous air flow inside the bus rather than air-con ducts.</p>

              <p><br> The behind was totally shit lah.Nth was coming out and it was so
              hot at the rear.Like u said,when i got on the bus and was walking
              to the rear,the front was so cold and nice.And i thought that the
              aircon would be very nice at the rear also and it turned out to be
              wrong.Might as well they dont put the uselss aircon duct at the
              rear and leave it like the rest of the bus where they no aircon
              ducts.SMRT has made a mistake in this by not putting aircon ducts
              and instead just putting vents.It seriously sucks.They shld
              continue the old style by putting aircon ducts.When the aircon
              dosent come out properly like this from the vents,thats it.U have
              to bear with the heat depending on the distance u are
              travelling.The more far u are travelling,the worse it is.There's
              nth for u to shift to get aircon also.At least when there are
              aircon ducts,u can shift it to get aircon.<br> <br> Btw wat aircon model is this yutong using?</p>

              <p>I find your justifications very biased. This bus is not the only bus that suffer from the hot rear problem. If you want to compare new buses, Scania K230s are as bad, if not worse. I'm often totally encapsulated with the heat coming out from the rear.</p>
              <p>From what I noticed, since the VO3X batch 2, new bus airconditionings seem to be a little erratic or faulty during the first weeks of service. The aircon seems to be more of fan mode rather than the usual cold mode. VO3Xs, Striders, DM3500s and even the OCs have this problem when they first started off.</p>
              <p>Learn to adapt to the new design. When people can wow other designs of overseas buses, I believe we can all adapt to new designs just like the Habits.</p>

              <p>It is on 854. And i am MAD on tt yutong.....</p>
              <p>Hear out e story:</p>
              <p>I went to bdk, and according to ben ong's sms for timings to yutong( i sms-ed last night for timings :( ) and found an OC instead of yutong. I took tt OC, and all the way to YSN the buses going down to BDK was either Habits or Carocerras. The go to YSN i saw e Yutong infront of me. My aunt went to deposit money, then we go YSN Int again. Yutong MISSING!!! I ended up taking back that bus which is SMB49X back to Bedok. That driver sure dumb one. Got one passenger ask him got go geylang(doubt to look for something...) He say Eunos. The bus go hougang already then he asked again, with a reply of " Got 51 go geylang, i think so la" from the SL. den reach Eunos MRT already, he nvr remind the passenger to alight. He end up alighting at the junction( which is NOT a bus stop) and walk back. Dumb rite? Reach BDK already. I sian la, yutong sleeping at parking lot. I dun wan take tt bus liao.</p>
