I do not specifically mentioned the similarity of both forums lies on that 'component', ie car/bus registration nos.<br><br>Let's look back at the topic - "Crazy about buses". The author was some kinda appalled, I presumed, to know that there are a number of people whom he/she claimed go 'ga-ga' over buses. That is the exact reason why I posted "Did you ask the same thing over at the Cars Forums?". The question posed by the author was as if "Of all things you can regard as a hobby, why buses?".<br><br>Bus Hobby and Car Hobby have similarities. We talk about performance of a bus, so do cars. We talk about the specifications of a bus, so do cars. We talk about modifcations made to some buses, so do cars. In general, I do not see a hobby about buses have a huge difference as a hobby about cars. I hope I cleared the air on this issue.<br><br>However I may want to take this opportunity to voice my displeasure that some new forumnites who frequented the Buses Forums, have actually brought down the reputation of this very forum. These people gave the impression to others that our hobby seemed very very childish and unprofessional. If they are mature enough, like what they claimed, they should know who they are and stop what they are doing. As a pioneer member of this forum, I have seen the standards of this forum going from good to bad and instead of going the other way round, it became worse.<br><br>Maybe because of these reasons that the author came up with such a topic and why some people regard Buses as a hobby nothing compared to Cars.</div>
