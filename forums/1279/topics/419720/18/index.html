              I wish it can run like a normal corporation. Better for it to close down and lquidate earlier.

              That I agree with you. That is why Singaporeans are always screwed up again and again after elections.
              
              On another persepective, even if SBST ask for a fare increase, it is still justifiable. They bothered to buy more new buses for improving the WAB status and bus frequncies as a whole, they bothered to improve bus frequncies and implement a system that makes bus trips more predictable, they bothered to maintain their buses generally well and clean and comfortable, etc. As a bigger player in the market, it emerges as a better one that bothers to listen and improve most of the times. Unlike SMRT, always first to ask and implement fare increases, yet little effort in improving.
              
              If SMRT feels that there is no incentive in using bendy buses to optimise their operations, why continue to stick their head in the mud, where they can buy more double deckers which allow more people to board and yet takes up less road space?
              They just can't be bothered, they only care for themselves.

              Add on:
              
              Poorly maintained and dirty buses. Check.
              Can't be bothered attitude. Check.
              
              Since the first day in this forum 3 years back, I had already had enough for their nonsense since they took over TIBS and my repeated comments on this poorly managed company truthfully reflects how terrible this company is. 
              3 years down the till present, they became from bad to worst. If not for LTA to step in to implement fines, they will not improve their bus frequencies during peak hours. Other than that, noting much has improved for the past few years. Now resorting to increase fares higher to commuters to pay for their fines, which is because of their own repeated screw ups which they should instead be responsible for their own actions instead of pointing fingers and putting the blame at others.  
              
              Seriously it is time that SMRTB should close down. The sooner, the better. Hand over their bus operations to SBST better. It is torturing for commuters to waste their money and time travelling with this poorly managed bus company. They just can't be bothered to put in effort to improve, even after so many years, but always be the first to ask for and implement fare increase which they have nothing genuine to prove the increase, and market a pack of lies to put themselves in a good position.

              The cycle will forever be the same as long as this govt controls.
              Increase COE premiums to force people to take public transport and after that increase public transport fares again with the same old lame excuses.
              They only care about solving their own problems and make profits for themselves.

              <p><br>This..</p>
              <p>In fact, there's people who have benefitted from distance fare, though direct long dist travellers have to pay more. In fact, more worthy for ppl to take feeders if they're staying 3 bus stops away, but my advise is.... Walking is better</p>
              <p>Anyway, distance fare benefits those who have longer express sv duration hours also. Which SMRT is lacking of.</p>
