              <p>I took the bus on it's last trip for the A shift BC. I saw this hole on the floorboard that is above the engine compartment. I told the BC when it reached the last bus stop outside SLBP. I showed him the hole. There were 3 other BCs who went to attend to the incident. I did this is because of safety reasons. I dun wan anyone to get hurt. If you want evidence, come ask me and i'll show it to you.</p>

              You could have just said it was withdrawn due to a hole in the floorboard. But you had to add yourself in, because you have became bigger than the hole in the process of explaining.

              <p>Look. You have a serious problem is phrasing your sentences such that people perceive the wrong impression of you (If you really don't mean it). People are willing to give that chance, but what we see here is the lack of effort to catch it. Once the chance it's over, I am sorry but its really gone. Its hard for a second opportunity to appear.</p>
              <p>Anyway shall not continue here. If you are really concerned about your problem on how to change please PM me. If you want to try clearing your consience (whatever its spelled) PM me too. I shall see how can I help.</p>

              <p><br>Let me be more precise, this metal panel was banging the floorboard along Express Sector and if someone were to step on it, it would spell I-N-J-U-R-Y.  That metal panel flew off and there's this big hole. I did not have the evidence of that flying off the floorboard but i have evidence of it banging up and down. I won't show it now since i have time constraints and i am not giving an excuse.</p>

                  Let me be more precise, this metal panel was banging the floorboard
                  along Express Sector and if someone were to step on it, it would
                  spell I-N-J-U-R-Y.  That metal panel flew off and there's this
                  big hole. I did not have the evidence of that flying off the
                  floorboard but i have evidence of it banging up and down. I won't
                  show it now since i have time constraints and i am not giving an
