              <p>Â </p>
              <p>And to SBS 8030L,</p>
              <p>Pls, you're not talking sense in my opinion. You are just finding someone to blame for the misfortune. All i just did was to ensure safety of fellow bus passengers and here you go, scolding me for doing a good thing AGAIN! I do pity your BC friend but pls, as stated above pls be hopeful as the rumour may become true. Have patience.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You don't have the right to ban me from Express 502. It's a public serivce, not a private service just for you only.</p>

              <p>put the matter to an end? i know its everyone's intention to minimise flaming here but i'll rather he answer to the questions he avoided, inclusive of the recent case and also not to show out his "good deeds" here, maybe in private yes but not here trying to create a good impression when his reputation is already quite bad here. if his reputation here is good then that's another case. in this case he can just say the bus was put out of service because of an damaged floorboard, not saying that he told the BC driving that bus this and that since he should know he will arouse flaming for that.</p>
              <p>if he can do all these, he probably will be respected the same way we bus fans respect each other. i know some of you are just sacrificing the tolerance and hatred for peace here. if he can answer to all this and adapt to them, there won't be any tolerating and hating of one another, there won't be any of such "putting the matter to an end" cases and flaming will then really be reduced to the minimum.</p>

I just want to be myself and i tell you, no one has the right to stop me from being myself. You guys dun seem to practice freedom of speech, do you?
