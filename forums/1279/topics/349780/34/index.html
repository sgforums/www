              <p>It's not only YOU, in this world, you can't say that there's no one can stop you. If you really want to be like that, I won't stop you. My best suggestion is that, when police visit you for any event, just tell them that no one has the right to stop you.</p>
              <p>You need to practice self control. So what if you did something good, when you're already having a very low reputation, if you don't click to this forum and post, I don't think anyone would know it's actually because of you, the bus is taken out of service.</p>
              <p>These buses would probably cameo sv502 again, if they cameo on 502 again, you don't catch, if there's any event like bus breakdown and you're not present, I don't think anyone will blame you. </p>
              <p>Regarding your behaviour onboard, there's no need for me to repeat again, I've heard enough too. Why can't you get your peace that you wanted? Then, Why we don't get the behaviour that everyone is comfortable with from you? I'm sure this explains that many chances are given to you, but you took none seriously.</p>

              <p>no one can control? do you even realise the cause of the flaming wars towards you? is being yourself that what stands out from you towards all of us? most of us are being ourselves but why is it that you stand out being notorious here?</p>
              <p>if i flame you, am i showing my "true colours" as someone who likes to flame others? what kind of theory is that?</p>
              <p>with reference to what QX179R has said, by flaming, it goes to show the behaviour that a person show to others but if by flaming for a cause that determines the problem at hand, it doesn't.</p>
              <p>you want peace. everyone does. but you have avoided problems that were caused by you. there is a reason why there are bus fans who flamed you and tolerated you. there were remedies which would have worked and which now you can still use to rectify the problem, but you didn't use them. would you rather other bus fans continue avoiding, tolerating and hating you because of problems that remained unsolved or unanswered, or using the remedies and then let those who had avoided, tolerated and hated you start to accept you? i think that you should consider that first before replying.</p>

              <p>Ok peeps cool it.</p>
              <p>In a word of fairness, if there had been a safety concern, tts has the right to raise the matter up.</p>
              <p>But tts you should know that you don't need to publise what you had done.  You may have done a good need or you might have overreacted.  And even if you did do something good, do you need to go round telling the world that you ndid something good.  It's like giving ten dollars to charity and then telling people abt it, or helping an old lady cross the road and telling ppl abt it.  Whatever good that might have come out has soured because of the desire for one to be in the limelight.  You can do things and you don't need to hang a sign telling everyone you did something good.  Silent acts of kindness will not go unnoticed and unrewarded, just that the reward might be better karma.  And what you did well, I think you just want people to think of you differentlybut no, people just see you as an attention whore and that's the feeling i am getting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure you can go on being yourself.  No one is stopping you.  But don't expect everyone to tolerate you or acceot the way you are. </p>

              <p>Seriously you are a mangkok. Why of all times, you want to spoilt the gd things that are coming on our way? And what's more it's my favourite service.

Because of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU</span></strong>, my BC friend doing P shift cannot drive that MKIV DM and instead drives a DM3500. Because of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU</span></strong>, bus fans who wanted to camp for that MKIV DM instead got a fleets of leylands and DM3500. Because of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU,</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">you wasted many of the bus fans time including me camping for that bus. And</span> because of <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU,</span></strong> <span style="color: #000000;">two MKIV DM on Sv 502 were taken out and the BC have to waste their time to swap buses.

              <p><br>apparently got hole on floorboard TTS happens discovers it, tells the BC. probably other commuters can tell BC. but happened to be him. It's ok. If any other commuters reported and we know nothing about why this cameo pulled out we'd all be left puzzled and fustrated too. so at least we still knew why this bus pulled out.</p>
              <p>It wasn't because of him, the bus apparently have a problem. TTS didnt caused the apparent hole to appear either . Your whole post above like using him as a scapegoat because you guys missed a rare cameo on your favourite service. 8030L, you suggesting that rare cameos &gt; safety? i doubt so.</p>
              <p>we know SBS896H is a B10M and the engine compartment is in the middle, With an apparent flaw on the floorboard. better to be safe than sorry. The area is going to be walked over by many people. what if something happen during peak hour</p>
              <p>This whole flaming is ONLY because the way TTS phrased + "rep" here.  You gonna blame a commuter for reporting a potential problem with the bus? Gosh. The problem is the way TTS phrase. no wonder everything blow up because focus on TTS caused your probs. </p>
              <p>bla. spotted TIB965Z on 106 (KJ 77) yesterday.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like I'm trying to put this matter to an end has ended up in vain.<br><br>My advisory to TTS is that you should have make a complete story of the incident like the hole on the florboard etc, instead of just simply posting as it is. This makes some bus fans understand what are you trying to talk about and to prevent misleading of information if its going way out of hand. I recommend also you should post the pix of the damaged floorboard or similar occurences next time (eg. faulty bus fixtures), because if you don't have pix or a complete story, other bus fans may thought that its a rumour or thought that there's falsified information coming from you. By doing a "good deed" and posting it here, doesn't mean you can post that incident without pix or improper &amp; unsupportive evidence, which means that the complete assurance of trust will not be an absolute 100%.<br><br>TTS: If you have any questions regarding about this, you can PM me so that I can be able to solve the problem faster.</div>
