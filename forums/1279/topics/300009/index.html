            <div class='col-md body'>Saw that last night around 7:30 PM along Selegie Road !<br>Was walking opposite to the direction of the coming bus (Alexander double-deck body on either Leyland or Volvo Olympian 3-axle chassis on SBS route) when i sensed something not right as it was coming ~ 50 km/h &amp; i could see the tyres of the front &amp; mid axles judding out as if it was turning left BUT in actuality it was going straight, meaning the bus body was 'slanted' instead of being parallel to the direction of travel as is normally expected from any vehicle !<br><br>The danger i can imagine of that is the driver may over-estimate the clearance between his vehicle &amp; anything to the left of it, since from his view @ the front it seems to have plenty of space on the left side BUT by the time the back-side portion of his bus catches up with any slower moving object on it's left (say another vehicle or worse a cyclist or pedestrian) then the left side clearance of the bus becomes lesser by say 15 CM which may result in hitting anything slower than it on the left of the road !<br><br>I understand in this type of city-bus 3-axle chassis, the mid-axle is also a steering-axle (in addition to the front axle) but with angle of rotation confined to 10 to 20 degrees &amp; supposed to be operational below 20 km/h while @ higher road speeds the mid-axle wheels are 'locked' in position laterally to be in-line with the rear driven axle ?<br><br>So it appears on that bus the locking mechanism failed resulting in the bus being able to go much higher than 20 km/h with such undesirable 4-wheel steering effects ?!?<br><br>Wonder if that's the 1st such incident or any known cases elsewhere &amp; any accidents as such ? Whatever the case, high time they sent it for maintenance service !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Up to the time of your post, seems you're the only person who precisely get my point.<br><br>I don't think all the others before you really understood my observations despite that i went into quite some background details.<br><br>I wish to add that the road was normally dry, the bus didn't seem to be skidding (i.e. no screaming sounds from the tyres &amp; no skid marks) &amp; it was even trying to accelerate to maintain speed as it went pass me.<br><br>The funny thing is that i was looking @ a near VERTICAL standing double-decker BUT whose bodywork is slanted diagonally (from the point of view looking @ the front of the vehicle) in the LATERAL  plane &amp; the whole thing was moving forwards in a STRAIGHT path with the front &amp; middle tyres judding out as if it was going to turn left but it just went straight on !<br><br>Perhaps by now the picture becomes clearer ??<br><br>My own analysis of this observation would be that as the bus seem fully packed with people (sitting + standing) the bulk of the vehicle's weight was transferred to mainly the front &amp; middle axles &amp; the bus-chassis may not then be as 'straight' as it should be if the weight distribution was more even.<br>Therefore in this situation the chassis may have sagged down between the front &amp; mid axles thereby causing the 3rd (driven) axle wheels to become less in contact with the road i.e. less driving traction than normal which may explain why the driver was trying to accelerate just to maintain speed on that flat road. ADDED to this situation any possible FAILURE of the mid-axle lateral wheel lock which enabled the 4-wheel steering to be ON even when the road speed was higher than 20 km/h collectively resulted in the bus moving straight in the direction guided by the parallel aligned wheels in the front &amp; mid axles while momentarilly 'ignoring' the direction of the wheels in the 3rd driven axle since those have less weight acting on them to 'grip' the road then ?!<br><br>The fact that Selegie Road is straight before a SLIGHT BEND towards the LEFT after the traffic junction with Middle Road may explain why the steered wheels were oriented towards the left (instead of right) when i saw the bus coming straight on the later straight stretch of Selegie Road, where i made my observations while walking along that road.<br><br>Hopefully by now the picture is even clearer.

It kept going up and down for as long as the traffic light stayed red..making me so dizzy..It was at least 10 to 20 seconds before the rear axle stopped moving.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Too much air in the air bellows? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Sorry if my description wasn't clear. The O405 wasn't lopsided as would happen due to faulty suspension. From my point of view, on the DD and looking down at the O405, it actually looked as if it was going to turn right as it travelled straight.</div>
