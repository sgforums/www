            <div class='col-md body'>Looking only from that rear photo, i'll say it could be front tyre puncture &amp; / or right side suspension air imbalance i.e. either of both cases certainly justifies immediate maintenence attention &amp; the vehicle should NOT be used until serviced !<br><br>Bearing in mind air-suspension generally requires low maintenence &amp; the fact that O 405 has been in-use for 10+ years, it's only timely it be given it's due overhaul servicing ! I know M-B's do have very long service lives (20 years NOT uncommon due to their fundementally sound &amp; advanced engineering !) but that does NOT mean corners can be cut on maintenence !!<br><br>Problem with some operators i suspect is that they think since they already invested quite a sum on a 1st class vehicle, therefore they can just get by giving 2nd or 3rd class maintenence ?! Such thinking is basically wrong because 1st class vehicle only deserves 1st class maintenence, nothing less !<br><br>Also noteworthy (but less obvious to most people) is the state of maintenence given to vehicles in the SJE fleet. I believe their maintenence standard is worse than either SBS or SMRT-TIBS ! In the case of their SH 114, took them hell of a long time to reduce the excessive noise &amp; vibration @ idling due to the air-con compressor coming on, remaining unresolved is the jerky &amp; sometimes squeaking accelerator pedal linkage which in turn makes it difficult to drive smoothly etc. Also their SH 111 seems to be using non original i.e. perhaps counterfelt sub-standard exhaust silencers, making it noisier than the 'standard' levels ! Shame on them for tolerating such shoddy attitude towards maintenence ! They probably say it's due to their cost constrains etc. BUT the point remains those 2 examples i've mentioned above are among the upper class of bus-chassi (being air-suspended M-B V8's in the coach class !) therefore as matter of course DO deserve equally up-class maintenence standards in order to rightfully maintain their originally designed standards, which the commutor rightfully expects !<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chickenlittle2:</div><div class="quote_body">This was extracted from this forum, so this is the air leak suspension<br><br>btw, this bus shall be SBS3766E (AMDEP 24) although the rego is censored. </div></blockquote></div>

Usually it will result in uneven tire wear , which results in quicker tire change and leading to greater expenses . Tire wear , still don't change ?

            <div class='col-md body'>You can say i've seen the chassis, but with the bodywork on it. Having noted the 15078 cc capacity i know Daimler does not have that engine in any other configuration except V8. You see 4 valve covers over 2 opposing rows on the engine so you know 4x2 = 8 cylinders.<br><br>As for performance, i naturally won't expect any problems up here in this class. I do believe in the latest 2nd generation Travego 3-axle coach Daimler has developed this engine further by increasing it to ~ 16000 cc, change to 4-valve per cylinder, add charge-cooling &amp; additives to make it Euro-4 compliant yet still keeping output @ 476 BHP &amp; 2000++ Nm !!<br><br>However the M-B V8's used by SJE &amp; in Malaysia i think is the 'tamer' version because of it's earlier less developed design but it's nice to know Daimler hasn't abandoned bus V-engine production &amp; still offers the V8 as it's top end engine option. To me it's not merely the performance alone that makes me prefer the V8, but rather the 'overall' engine 'experience' expressed in terms of the superior refinement factor thru the generally low noise, vibration &amp; harshness levels over the performance spectrum of the engine. Because if you only want performance, nowadays i believe you already have the new generation MAN &amp; Scania in Malaysia with 4-valve/cylinder charge-cooled 12000 cc engines of only in-line 6 cylinders producing say up to 422 BHP, which is quite close to the new M-B V8's of 476 BHP. BUT the 'problem' i'll expect from these in-line 6 smaller cc engines is the lack of the feel of the above mentioned 'refinement class' which only tends to come from big cc V8 engines. Something like why they still make cars with V-12 engines when in-line 6 cylinder engines can be modified also to produce quite close performance levels but minus the classy 'refinement' factor which only the V-type engines can offer.<br><br>As for the M-B V8's in Malaysia, i believe Genting Resorts operates some departing from KL Sentral &amp; Pudu Raya many times daily. Unlike the newer charged-cooled small cc engines, the big cc V8's can make do with quite low RPM's yet still move smoothly, quietly with strong torque uphill without the absolute need to rev hard. Of course if they rev it hard then the potency increases without the need to 'struggle' unlike the smaller cc's.<br><br>Besides Genting Resorts other operators i know include Transtar, 5-Star, Sri Maju not forgetting an operator (name forgotten) who even changed the exhaust to AMG twin-type !! Nowadays i'll take it via Sri Maju for the KL-SGP trip &amp; of course via SJE if between JB-SGP. Those on Transtar seem noisier to me while those on Sri Maju are quieter even @ the extreme rear just next to the engine. I'll put it as due to different coachworks used by these different operators. But whatever the case, i always get this 'one up' sensation when aboard a V8 vehicle in that you know you're like 1 class up over the rest with only 6-cylinders ! That itself, to me, more than compensates for forgoing any of the questionable frills like massaging seats, individual videos etc. on the newer but only 'lowly' in-line 6-cylinder coaches.<br><br>If taking it within Singapore, i think the peak hour private bus service on 640 has at least 1 unit. Seen it along Selegie Road with passengers. They changed the M-B star to a gold plated version (perhaps to reflect the V8 status) using Kassbohrer Setra coach headlamps.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scania N113CRB luver:</div><div class="quote_body">You saw the chassis?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Think theres this bus at Genting too .
