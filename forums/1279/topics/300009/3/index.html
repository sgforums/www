            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hseochin:</div><div class="quote_body">You can say i've seen the chassis, but with the bodywork on it. Having noted the 15078 cc capacity i know Daimler does not have that engine in any other configuration except V8. You see 4 valve covers over 2 opposing rows on the engine so you know 4x2 = 8 cylinders.<br><br>As for performance, i naturally won't expect any problems up here in this class. I do believe in the latest 2nd generation Travego 3-axle coach Daimler has developed this engine further by increasing it to ~ 16000 cc, change to 4-valve per cylinder, add charge-cooling &amp; additives to make it Euro-4 compliant yet still keeping output @ 476 BHP &amp; 2000++ Nm !!<br><br>However the M-B V8's used by SJE &amp; in Malaysia i think is the 'tamer' version because of it's earlier less developed design but it's nice to know Daimler hasn't abandoned bus V-engine production &amp; still offers the V8 as it's top end engine option. To me it's not merely the performance alone that makes me prefer the V8, but rather the 'overall' engine 'experience' expressed in terms of the superior refinement factor thru the generally low noise, vibration &amp; harshness levels over the performance spectrum of the engine. Because if you only want performance, nowadays i believe you already have the new generation MAN &amp; Scania in Malaysia with 4-valve/cylinder charge-cooled 12000 cc engines of only in-line 6 cylinders producing say up to 422 BHP, which is quite close to the new M-B V8's of 476 BHP. BUT the 'problem' i'll expect from these in-line 6 smaller cc engines is the lack of the feel of the above mentioned 'refinement class' which only tends to come from big cc V8 engines. Something like why they still make cars with V-12 engines when in-line 6 cylinder engines can be modified also to produce quite close performance levels but minus the classy 'refinement' factor which only the V-type engines can offer.<br><br>As for the M-B V8's in Malaysia, i believe Genting Resorts operates some departing from KL Sentral &amp; Pudu Raya many times daily. Unlike the newer charged-cooled small cc engines, the big cc V8's can make do with quite low RPM's yet still move smoothly, quietly with strong torque uphill without the absolute need to rev hard. Of course if they rev it hard then the potency increases without the need to 'struggle' unlike the smaller cc's.<br><br>Besides Genting Resorts other operators i know include Transtar, 5-Star, Sri Maju not forgetting an operator (name forgotten) who even changed the exhaust to AMG twin-type !! Nowadays i'll take it via Sri Maju for the KL-SGP trip &amp; of course via SJE if between JB-SGP. Those on Transtar seem noisier to me while those on Sri Maju are quieter even @ the extreme rear just next to the engine. I'll put it as due to different coachworks used by these different operators. But whatever the case, i always get this 'one up' sensation when aboard a V8 vehicle in that you know you're like 1 class up over the rest with only 6-cylinders ! That itself, to me, more than compensates for forgoing any of the questionable frills like massaging seats, individual videos etc. on the newer but only 'lowly' in-line 6-cylinder coaches.<br><br>If taking it within Singapore, i think the peak hour private bus service on 640 has at least 1 unit. Seen it along Selegie Road with passengers. They changed the M-B star to a gold plated version (perhaps to reflect the V8 status) using Kassbohrer Setra coach headlamps.<br><br></div></blockquote>An engine with 15078 cc is definitely a V8 , well for the case of MB . The only engine that came close to this capacity and is not a V8 is Volvo's D16 , the engine used in the Volvo FH16 truck . It produces a whopping 660BHP maximum . Can't remember the torque tho .<br><br>Wow. If one of these companies actually zhng the bus , and installed twin turbo , think the bus will really zip thru the expressway like no other ! V-engines are one of the few engines that can be installed with twin turbo .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the Volvo's case, their 660 BHP output is compliant to which exhaust emission level ? I notice (with some exceptions) that for basically the same engine i.e. same cc &amp; aspiration mode, with earlier emission standards the output tends to be higher but with more stringent emissions, the output is lowered. M-B also has a top-end truck in the 600+ BHP class which i believe is also based on the same 16-litre V8 as their coach. MAN also has representation in this class.<br><br>Actually it shouldn't be too expensive &amp; not technically impossible to do an engine upgrade as the bus-chassis was originally available with basically the same engine but with naturally aspirated, turbocharged &amp; charged-cooled versions. Perhaps some operator in Malaysia can buy some such 2nd hand engines to retrofit ? In Malaysia things tend to be more 'flexible', so i believe that can be a reality.<br><br>I'll definitely want a trip on such an upgraded V8 coach.

Also, traction depends on the weight applied on the wheel, which in turn is dependent on the payload acting over the driven wheels, which in turn is somewhat dependent on the physical distribution (i.e. location) of the variable payloads (i.e. people/goods) on the vehicle.<br><br>Even the real experts need real accurate descriptions of the symptoms in order to give an answer which is specifically relevant rather than for some other general / common problems.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi Hseochin, do you know what are you talking in regards to the technical aspect? Because it doesn't make sense at all.<br><br>From what you're saying, you do not have any idea about the buses chassis technology.<br><br>You need to study how the chassis technology works before coming to comment further on this issue.<br><br>I'm sorry for sounding blunt.

Thank you, MS sensei.</div></blockquote>Don't call me sensei. The automotive technology is my ricebowl. Having spent years from workshop to management and now as a manufacturer level, I still have a lot to learn from my seniors. Technology is without depth. Because the moment you thought you know something, something new will come out of the blue one day and you need to upgrade yourself.<br><br>But you are right to say the above as in (1) and (2)<br>You are also right to say that this fault can happen to both 2 and 3 axled buses.<br><br>The bus with a healthy working air spring will be able to read the movement of load in the vehicle cabin. Then as the air spring of the same axle compresses more than the other, compressed air will be fed to the more compressed air spring to heighten up and allow the cabin to be levelled.<br><br>Bus weight has distribution has been a challenge to vehicle chassis builders. When vehicles are going through the process of developement, the weight distribution must be one of the top priorities to be tackled. A vehicle with poor weight distribution can lose control easily.<br><br>Also, you need to understand that vehicle cabin is suspended from the vehicle chassis. The weight distribution is governed by the effectiveness of the suspensions. And so, with pressurized air, the air springs (air bellows) suspends the vehicle cabin and the shock absorber dampens the oscilliation movement of the air springs to ensure comfort and road hugging capabilities.<br><br>Bus advanced suspensions systems can even read terrain condition &amp; driver's driving style to automatically mechatronically adjust the damping characteristics to optimize operational condition. The commands are received from accelerometers to the suspension ECU before returning to the shock absorbers for actual mechanical action. The speed of these adjustments can be as quick a fraction of a second. This system is also known as PDC (Pneumatic Damping Control)<br><br>A bus going straight with a diagionally oriented body is due to a worn torsion bar mounting bush. If the bus still can be movable, the bar should not break. If the bar breaks, the axle will immediately go disoriented. these kind of incidences are rare.<br>The axle is still considered to be in the 'forward' direction but has come disoriented from the vehicle chassis. But strictly speaking, the axle is in danger of breaking as differential units in the axle system will not be able to operate normally.<br>Steerable axles are equipped with tie roads and mounted to the double wishbone with a king pin. if the torsion bar of the steerable axle is loose, chances of a broken axle is even more imminent. This is due to the dynamic movement of the axle in view of the steering capability.</div>
