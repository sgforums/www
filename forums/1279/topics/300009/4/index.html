            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you for the manufacturer list for my reference. I'm sure their info would be useful for greater understanding on the technical-micro aspects of vehicle chassis technology.<br><br>Regards your comments on para. 2 &amp; 3 below of your post, you're suggesting that i'm technically ignorant &amp; just like to play with words as if like wanting to win some debating competition ??<br><br>About the lack of technical knowledge, FYI i graduated in mechanical engineering &amp; have worked for ~ 11 years in a private professional engineering consultancy practice before venturing into the offshore business arena, among my various interest areas which include Linux computing etc. Fact is i'm more a 'hard' than a 'soft' subject person i.e. more technical than artistic by nature. Of course when dealing with the nuts &amp; bolts aspects of buses, i'll tend to be more ignorant compared to someone like yourself who deals with it everyday &amp; hence you can understand &amp; describe better the technically finer points.<br><br>Also, to be very frank, such issue like pride do NOT even come into my mind whenever i post in any forum. When i post, i just want to communicate my points as effectively across as i can. If i sense (from the replies / comments i get under this topic e.g.) that the readers still cannot understand, overlook or simply ignore the essential messages i want to get across, that's when i'll try to 'add more words' but NOT tantamount to 'wriggling with words' to try to get people to understand the overall picture i want to show. Whether they agree / disagree with my picture is entirely up to them. I respect each individual's viewpoint whether or not i agree with them as long as they supply relevant supporting arguments instead of just seemingly evading my questions &amp; just presenting their comments, which therefore cannot satisfy my curiousity which is why i end up putting in more words to try to achieve the above.<br><br>Therefore, regarding the question in my previous post, can you give just a simple answer (MCQ style) no matter how irrelevant you consider it to be in the context of this topic ??<br><br>Q: The 3-axle Olympians here have 4-wheel steering (mid axle wheels only steerable with reduced range compared to front axle wheels) &amp; only the rear most axle is driven ?<br><br>Answer : 1) Yes  2) No  3) Not sure  4) Secret, so cannot tell<br><br>Just 1 more question : The Dennis Tridents here only have front axle 2-wheel steering, with only the mid axle driven &amp; the rear most axle just a trailing axle ??<br><br>Answer : 1) Yes  2) No  3) Not sure  4) Secret, so cannot tell<br><br>Your frank responces most appreciated !! Thanks.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MS:</div><div class="quote_body">haha... OKOK.<br>I don't like to be hailed as whatever expert or anything. In this line of engineering, technology is mutating everyday. What we know today may be obselete quickly. So I welcome everyone to bring up their views in the mode of discussion and everyone be open for discussion. In this way, everyone benefits from the exchange of knowledge. On top of that, I don't like the idea of because of who I am, my explanation is final. I also started off knowing nothing of automotive engineering many years ago. My learning path was plagued with thorns before I achieved what I have today. And even so, the path before me to seek for a better tomorrow is no easier .<br><br>Please allow me to recommend that you need to understand that you've portrayed an explicit lack of technical knowledge. And by commenting on the issues you're ignorant of, you've encouraged a perception of error for the rest to absorb.<br><br>Also, everyone makes mistakes. So do I. But it is about how we learn from our mistakes and not to wriggle with the words to sustain the pride which is the main contributing factor towards your ignorance.<br><br>If you're interested to know more about vehicle chassis technology, you may want to refer to the following manufacturers for help. These are currently some of the most popular and technologically leading brands in this aspect. They have contributed greatly towards the development of the global automotive engineering sector form Ferraris to Hinos.<br><br>- Lemforder<br>You can ask about undercarriages linkages, steering systems for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.<br><br>- ZF Parts<br>You can learn about steering systems for passenger cars.<br><br>- SACHS<br>The technological leading suspensions and drivetrain specialists.<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is true that the Leyland Olympians in SLWS have 2 steering axles with the front as a trailing steerable axle.<br><br>However I have not maintained the Dennis before so I cannot comment. I will need to go back to office to search the offical TecDoc for clues. eg. with or without tie rod end supplied as parts to determine whether it is a steerable axle or not.<br><br>You need to differenciate between the 3 types of axles:<br><br>Steering - Axles which incorporates the presence of tie rod assemblies. Could also be driven or non-driven (trailing)<br><br>Driven - axles with drive but no tie rod assemblies therefore unable to be steered. Driven axles still have a propeller shaft input into the differential axle.<br><br>Trailing - without tie-rod assemblies and without drive. Does not have propeller shaft input. Cannot even be considered as axle. At most a driven wheel assembly generally with the wheels and lower/upper army assembly leverage and suspensions system, brakes systems, wheel bearings.<br><br>I do not determine the bus is a steerable axle or driven axle etc by merely looking as a commuter on the ground. I need to go under the chassis and check for the presence of propeller shaft drive into the axle, axle design and presence of tie rods before I can make conclusions. If not, I will need to obtain the partnumber of the axle and check with TecDoc again. TecDoc is the internationally recognised automotive parts database which have been officially endorsed by manufacturers.<br><br>Dear all, you all may want to check up the following key words which can help to improve your knowledge towards automotive chassis technology.<br><br>- Tie Rod<br>- Propellor Shaft<br>- King Pin<br>- Double wishbone<br></div>

If it SP, they just say SP lor. So I dunno whether some pple here said the truth.<br><br>My friend's father who was a SLBP driver drove SBS 9095T (Afternoon shift) this week told me before that his fav bus to drive is mercz but for steering wheel wise would be VO2x. I asked him before regarding the LO3x steering wheel before, he say the steering wheel is tough but he says it is just whether u r used to it. He nv experienced any back paint but just few that it need a little more strength to turn but that would make him stay awake!<br><br>Btw, look at how he drive and turn the steering wheel. Give SLBP some more time, some steering wheels are fixed but not all yet. SLBP is now fixing &amp; tuning the engine. AMDEP have not done that.<br><br>SLBP only got SP mercz for their SD replacement. Do rmb some svc only can take in SD svc. Like I say, recently there are more SP buses for SLBP so refurbish would be faster lor.<br><br>I had tested most of rear seats on SLBP buses .  Besides the right side of the bus which heat radiates a lot there (Which is mercz problem long ago), there are no feeling of heat and the sides and center. Not to say that, about 1 mthago I board SBS 109Y. Wa.. Hot seats at the reat(Center).<br><br>I think your maintanance for AMDEP means more like refurbish for me. They like to refurbish buses but not solving the internal problem like suspension problem.<br><br>SLBP priorities maintainance steps. They are engine condition, suspension problem(Most important), Air Con, interior cleanliness of the bus. Others would be done later or even let other depot do the job.<br><br>You are right, it is not the depot problem but it is the manager problem that should see it or remind the driver to report if the bus got any problem. You see BNL drivers would report any fault or even when the aircon is not working and remove the bus from service immediately.</div>
