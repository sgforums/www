The fact that the East has 2/3s of the population means that they have to rely on mainly buses from the Eastern depots. Note, I dint say better maintenace found in just the East district, but in the Eastern depots (amdep, hgdep and bndep).<br><br>Technical parts wise, amdep is better than slbp. So what slbp OCC handles hgdep, we talking maintenance here, you talking operations...really you need to direct Chicken law clause no. 5 "Come straight to the point, be straightfoward" or something like that (only you would know) to yourself. I can say, at least bndep and bbdep maintains their buses better than slbp, I must say, after being served by TIBS and the Eastern depots and bbdep for so long, I'm a little bit unused to slbp's cost-efficient maintenance.</div>

AMDEP is outperforming in maintaining O405. SLBP O405s (In particular, Sv 52 buses) have irritating squeaky doors which means it lacks oiling. In contrast, AMDEP O405s have smooth doors that don't squeak.

I don't side amdep but their buses are generally well maintained and performs better. SBS9199C is one of the good LOs under amdep.

Many buses such as the LOs and Mercz, and also inludes bndep and hgdep buses still go to amdep for maintenance or even refurbish, I've seen SBS9012H (ex-SL 143) SBS9819Y (BN SP) and SBS546T (ex-HG 100) parking inside amdep with my own eyes, and there's also some others spotted inside (can't see rego).<br><br>You may say hgdep is under west district control, however, maintenance wise the eastern trio amdep bndep and hgdep buses still visit each other for maintenence. I only know that bndep did not take charge of changing the MK4 seats into yellow colour in 2006, the Mk4s were either sent to amdep or hgdep for seat cover changed. bndep does sent its B10Ms over to hgdep for maintenance.

I took the refurbished SBS9378C of S55 amdep when it just came out from lay-up status, passing by Victoria School. The students boarded and say, "wah! new bus wor!". Lolx. It depends how people look at refurbished buses, because the refurbished mercz didn't look much different.
