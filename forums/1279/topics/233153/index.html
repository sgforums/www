(Sometimes it's impossible to board 518 at Suntec.)<br><br>I tried 30e too. The amount of time saved is tiny because of the traffic jams along ECP during peak hours. I feel that 30e should skip the bus stop at Dunman Rd so that it can go directly from Geylang Rd to Guillemard Rd without making a big detour via Tanjong Katong Rd, Dunman Rd and Guillemard Camp Rd...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I took 174<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span> before from Orchard Road to Boon Lay, and the bus was quite badly held up by jams around the Bukit Timah area, and towards the end of the journey, the bus driver (a lady) told me that we should have reached the interchange by 7:00 PM (I took the 6:17 PM bus from Orchard Station) (earlier on, when I asked her when we will reach Boon Lay, she gave me a time of 7:10 PM as she factored in the delays, as I could later find out); we reached at about 7:08 PM. She went on to have s small rant about how this all cause much headaches and troubles for her, like having to queue at the depot, etc.<br><br>However, 174<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span> still did shave some time off my journey - I have tried using the normal 174 to get from Orchard to Boon Lay before too, and it took more than an hour to reach Boon Lay.</div>
