I am part of the Circle Line engineering team, infact, part of the team that is overlooking holland V.<br><br>1. Circle Line is totally undergrounsd with very thick walls. Why? Go figure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>2. Holland V. is very messy due to the fact we are all working in an extremely constraint space. Basically, we receive tons of complaints from expatriates and some MIW living there weekly. Its a nightmare for us enginners too.<br><br>Once, one of my supervisors had an ang-moh guy throwing down sandwich  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> (presume for breakfast?) at him while he was doing some soil boring. Look at it this way, we faced tons of pressure from everyone while we still have to deal with our work pressure.<br><br>One of my colleague planned the H.V traffic layout. Ok ok.. it sucks to most ppl, yet how much space can we play ard given we are building a station right beneath the junction? Frankly, the roads will move alot more as time goes by. Hope you guys will bear wit it, after all of ya will benefit from having a station there, including the biz there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>3. Serangoon station indeed has some soil settlement conditions but this is inevitable. We can only try our very best to estimate the soil condtions below so that we will knw wat to do. That's why soil boring comes in., to allow us to collect samples of soil below so we know what lies beneath... pity my supervisor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Tunneling is as much an art as well as science. Nobody knows the very next one metre in front of the tunnel boring machine would have large amount of water rushing in. When large amt of water rush in, ground above will slightly sink. In worst scenarios, the ground above create a large sinkhole or even collapse of tunnel walls below, causing deaths to the miners and engineers below. Tunneling needs abit of intution as well as science to anticipate what's in front, failure to resultng in disasters.<br><br>4. I am a Singaporean and very proud to be too. You guys should see the number of foreigners working here.. Engineers and const workers alike. Few Singaporeans will be able to accept working hours from 8am to 8pm, 6 days week, throwing in OTs without pay and hot dusty weather. Yet without us, how can the economy of Singapore be pushed on? it may not be as glamourous as entrepreneur, financial analyst, IB, life science researchers..<br><br>But do you guys knw what civil engineering stands for?? "civil" stand for civilisation. We create civilisation for human to progress. yeah.. its a sunset industry but hey.. who says we can't strike out in other countries?? Ok.. that ends for me now. if ya ppl have any queries, feel free to ak me. i will try to help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>

The service only duplicates CCL between Upp Paya Lebar and Bartley stations, and between HarbourFront and Alexandra stations. I hope it will not be withdrawn, the most it gets amend.<br><br>From Clementi, service 165 provides a direct link to Upp Thomson which is not served by CCL, and is faster than taking service 166.</div>
