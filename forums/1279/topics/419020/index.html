              <p>If the findings is true, it is probably because of too many complains about/regarding the engine braking effect of this earlier batches of kub (which can easily cause ppl to fall if they did not grab a pole)</p>
              <p>Havent been on a kub for quite some time so i wouldnt comment if it really is this effect.</p>

              <p><br>Its not neutral. Its just that the lock-up clutch disengages once the last gear it was at switches downwards.</p>
              <p>For the integrated gearbox retarder to work, the relevant gear must still be engaged.</p>
              <p>I think it has got to do with SBST doing away with the engine-braking once the bus's mainteinance was fully handed over from Scania.</p>
              <p>I think its a good thing. The engine braking is just irritating and under most road conditions, and given the bus goes around at speeds &lt;60km/h, there's really no need for it. It doesnt justify the added complexity in having to time the clutching in, and the wearing out of the clutch surface.</p>

              <p><br>Lock-up clutch works pretty much on the same principals.</p>
              <p>Its like a hybrid between auto and manual, combining the auto's convenience with the elimination of the power loss from the torque converter.</p>

              <p><br>I'm very tempted to call you "siao".</p>
              <p>You know how terrible the jerks are?</p>
              <p>Especially the transition from 5th to 4th.</p>
              <p>I don't exactly get how the ZF6 works, but 4th to 5th is a rather interesting transition. Shifting up doesnt seem to require any movement from the lock-up clutch, but shifting down induces a really violent jerk. Its like machiam the clutch clutches in too quickly.</p>
              <p>Good riddance to the engine-braking. And high-time too after all the negative feedback. In any case, with the exception of some SMRT buses, the vast majority of the ZF4/5s do not utilise engine-brake.</p>
              <p>If the KUBs are super lousy, then the B9TL is worse under the context you define.</p>

              but i find 8212D different from the rest of the modified ones. This bus has very rapid and smooth gear change and the accelaration is very powerful. braking performance is also smooth and excellent.
