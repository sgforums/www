              <p>During morning peak hours, additional SBST95 buses were seen starting from Buona Vista Terminal, North Buona Vista Road (MRT).</p>
              <p>The extra buses have skipped the bus stops at Holland Drive and Commonwealth Ave, for they exited from Buona Vista Terminal via the North Buona Vista Road exit (like SBST 32, 145).</p>
              <p>Many times I saw SBST95 buses with super high loads, and some with little passengers along North Buona Vista Road, I have pondered till I saw the extra SBST95 buses exited out from BV bus terminal and to North Buona Vista Road.</p>
              <p>I hope SBST would know that there are many students and workers waiting for SBST95 at bus stop along Commonwealth Ave too. Perhaps 1 or 2 of the extra SBST95 buses should exit to Holland Drive instead, to pick up the passengers waiting at Holland Drive and Commonwealth Ave bus stops.</p>

              <p>If the extra buses went the normal way out, then the buses would have been packed by the time they reach Buona Vista Station.
              <br><br>
              So by letting the regular buses do the required full trips, these extra buses can concentrate on the Buona Vista Station stop while improving turnaround time.

              <p>The is not the normal 95 you are talking about right? It is therefore normal to skip the bus stops before the bouna vista one. If not I tell you sure fully packed by the time it reaches bouna vista. Everyday I see 95 so damn packed... that is why I take 198.. but for arts students i understand you all need to die die take 95.</p>
              <p>Therefore several suggestions. Firstly, if you all wanna have more chances of boarding 95, you can always dont wait at bouna vista stop. Those taking MRT and alighting at bouna vista can instead walk to the earlier bus stop. The distance is the same and it is sheltered and so therefore there is no risk of getting caught in the rain or what.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if you die die wanna have a seat in the bus, go to the bus stop earlier than the one at bouna vista MRT, then cross the overhead bridge over to the bus stop opposite, take 95 from there and sure you will have seats, but the bus will need to make a loop and thus a longer ride.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, for students from arts, you can take MRT to clementi and take 96, I think 96 has a higher frequency as well.</p>
              <p>Fourthly, Science students can take 198 instead of 95, walking abit more does not kill you, it strengthens you instead. So why not take 198, some more its double decked and its always quite empty.</p>
              <p>Fifthly, request to SBS to have 95 changed to a double deck. However, because 95 only serves between kent ridge terminal and bouna vista/holland area, the SBS might not agree to it as it might cost them $$$. Also since demand for SBS is in higher demand only during peak hours and working days. Therefore, there is a high chance of them voiding such requests. However, if they can do it for 151, they can do it for 95, its up to them. For example 179 for NTU they are able to do it (but 179 the passengers for the service is almost about 3-4 times that of the passengers for 95).</p>

              <p>Great tip there! Though those who do not mind walking a wee bit further can always take #92, especially those staying at Ghim Moh, or #200. Drop off at Science Park near NUH and walk :P</p>
              <p>There are other services that pass by NUS, along AYE and West Coast Rd. <strong>I strongly suggest avoiding SBST95 because it's either too packed or the wait is too long during off-peak hrs.</strong> If you're close to / from Jurong East, take 183 (to Engin) or 97, 197 (opposite SRC field). 188 is good option too.</p>
              <p>If you're from BNV MRT and you don't mind an extra 19 cents travelling (69 cents for minimum fee MINUS 50 cents transfer rebate), take #196 to Clementi Road and stop at the stop beside the new University Town (now under construction). There, you have THREE options - 33,96,183.</p>
              <p>151 is double decker because it goes a loooong distance, up to Hougang, and it can be packed along Dunearn Rd / Bt Timah Rd too, during peak hours. I thought 151 was not double decker because of the super steep slope between YIH and Central Library.</p>
              <p>Or else, wait until Circle Line CC24 Kent Ridge to be done and save the hassle of taking a bus. Though you would have to walk some distance to take the internal shuttle bus (ISB).</p>

              <p><br>151 DD only operates during peak hours. From what i remember the first bus from HG used to be a DD but has been downgraded. taking sv95A to NUH from Buona Vista can combat abit of the demand issue; from there take the A shuttle to other parts of NUS.</p>

              <p><br>I am not requesting all the extra buses to ply from BV Terminal to Holland Drive and to Commonwealth Ave. I am suggesting perhaps out of the many extra trips, perhaps 1~2 trips should ply along Commonwealth Ave to pick up the students there. Because I have seen empty 95 buses (half filled) right after the MOE bus stop, and 1 or 2 super packed sbst95 buses too. The empty buses begin their trip right from North Buona Vista Road, whilst the super packed 95 buses have picked up the passengers at Commonwealth Ave. </p>

              <p>This is not a valid TIPS, if you alight at BV MRT, take sbst95 at busstop along North Buona Vista. DO not walk to Commonwealth Ave. Extra sbst95 buses (travel direct from North Buona Vista) do not ply to Commonwealth Ave, thus more chances having seats and standing space if you board your sbst95 at North Buona Vista Road instead.</p>
