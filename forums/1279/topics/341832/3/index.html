              <p>I think the Elbo bodyworks and internal furnishings are not
                  suitable for the Scania suspensions. To make the buses more lasting
                  probably require a rebodying. Otherwise you can see the aircon,
                  wall and ceiling panels coming loose all the time even after any
                  refurbishment. The aircon cant really be helped - unlike the Merc
                  CAC's, the Elbo's overhead ductings, panels and vents were never
                  meant to conduct processed air anyway. They were originally meant
                  to be NAC's all the way. If you increase the Aircon
                  power/output, all it does is to leak the
                  cool air out at the first non-airtight spot
                  along the conduit.</p>

              <p>SBS Transit's NAC buses (i.e. the Volvo B10M MKII, Mercedes MB O405, and Scania N113CRB) were also never meant to be air-conditioned buses.</p>
              <p>We all know what SBS Transit did to them to make sure they can be air-conditioned buses.</p>

              <p>It's whether SMRT wants to do it, or not. These buses should have about a decade until the end of their lifespan if left on the roads.</p>
              <p>And it's probably better than spending more money on new buses. Didn't they give this as an excuse to resist purchasing new MRT trains for their old lines initially, refurbishing the old ones instead? Why adopt a totally opposite direction for buses?</p>

              <p><br>You forget about economies of scale. The SBS Mercs and Scania NAC's as well as the B10M's number in the sheer hundreds and nearing a thousand. In whatever case the contractor would be able to give quotations that justify mass productions of the refurbishments. Now we are talking about only 15 units. Elbo bodyworks are not very common; the interior fittings as well as the wheel well skirtings were showing to be of inferior quality so I dont think SMRT would want to go back to them for refurbishments. The only other option would be getting third party contractors to do it but to custom design a refurbishment kit just for 15 units may not be worth the effort and money.</p>

              <p>As a company, such an early retirement would be of quite some loss... It is true that these buses are non-standard in the fleet, but they could be relegated to services that require lesser buses and have lesser passenger flow, then the buses and fleet could be adjusted...</p>

              <p>I dont know... but I guess things back then are not the same as things now. For a start I am not even sure if the 15 year limit for public buses applied back then. Yes, the Elbo 113's going would be some sort of a waste. But I guess it had been a weighted decision. I sure do not like Dennis Lances and in fact I would prefer a ride in an Elbo Scania over a Lance any day. But I think using similar reasonings the Lances will get to see their full 15/17 year cycle with a round of refurb perhaps if necessary.</p>

              <p><br>Rebodying the buses may be an option. But with the OCs coming in, it'll be easier to just replace then to actually rebody the Scanias. Don't think SMRT will rebody them (scrapping them for a flat fee can balance out with the OCs).</p>
              <p>As for your theory with refurbishing the trains by SMRT</p>
              <ul>
              <li>the trainsets can techincally last quite long even with daily usuage.</li>
              <li>They didn't have rebodying. The original body is just painted/stickered over with a new livery, and refurbished with a new interior.</li>
              <li>They don't have engine components and vibrations found in the Scanias Elbos, they run on motors.</li>

              <p>I dont know... but I guess things back then are not the same as
              things now. For a start I am not even sure if the 15 year limit for
              public buses applied back then. Yes, the Elbo 113's going would be
              some sort of a waste. But I guess it had been a weighted decision.
              I sure do not like Dennis Lances and in fact I would prefer a ride
              in an Elbo Scania over a Lance any day. But I think using similar
              reasonings the Lances will get to see their full 15/17 year cycle
              with a round of refurb perhaps if necessary.</p>

              <p>I think SMRT is speeding up the non-Mercedes buses like UD and ELBO is due to their bad conditions and the ability to meet the WAB requirement from LTA, which is 40% of the total fleet by 2010. If they have no intentions to expand the fleet for now, the only way to meet the quota is only by getting rid of the older buses.</p>
              <p>But I think the UMW Dennis Lances needs refurbishment more than any other buses, thanks to the all fabric interior.</p>

              <p>If SMRT is trying to achieve a 40% WAB fleet while trying to avoid a fleet expansion at all costs, then I can forsee a real disaster for everyone later on. And when I said everyone, I really mean everyone: SMRT's management will have to explain why they squandered away so much money on buying new buses to replace old buses that still have a considerable number of years within their statuory lifespan and could probably be fixed more cheaply, and why - if they were running out of depot space, were they not planning to get a new bus depot; commuters will continue having to put up with unaceptably- and unbearably-long waiting times for SMRT buses, and bus fans will grieve over the loss of several bus models and the further "Stalinisation" of the local bus fleet.</p>
              <p>Trust me, while I'm not sure where Saw Phaik Hwa is taking SMRT buses to, I'm pretty sure she only thought about herself and her bank account when she made the decisions, and no-one and nothing else.</p>
              <p>When this disaster happens, I bet she will have a lot of explaining to do, if she hasn't ran off with the money and left the carnage for someone else to take over, that is.</p>
