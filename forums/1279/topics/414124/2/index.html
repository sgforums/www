              <p>Ah, it has finally caught fire. Took this bus almost every other day for the past 4 years on Svc 69 and was wondering daily when the engine or gearbox might blow up. You know, the bus can't seem to shift gears at all until it reaches max rpm. Seriously, never seen another B10M rev that high. It's literally screaming before the gearbox shifts with a huge jerk. Once saw the Rev counter hit 2800RPM before shifting. Another fun fact about the bus: The interior smells like crayons somehow.</p>

              <p>Oops. Thank goodness I took it a few days ago, but it's gearbox seems to be fixed when I took it that day, no high revving like in SBS987D during last year(now fixed also). Anyway my fav type of bus is also strider, so I hope it can be repaired=(</p>

              <p>Firstly, when i boarded the bus, there is no aircon<br>2. The motors are on when its parking there<br>3. When the bus is overcrowded, its too stuffy<br>4. Due to the weather today</p>

              <p>Think that bus has some trouble, was there just now. There were two

              started the bus don't seem to be a regular bus driver but rather
               looks like a maintenace tech, he was wearing white while the other was

              <p>When he started the bus engine there was 
              this loud cracking popping sound being heard and in a split second there were flames coming out from the middle with burning diesel leaking out onto the 
              concrete bus bay. Some people who were waiting in the bus interchange 
              got panic and ran, the best is the two persons on board didn't even know that
               the bus was on fire until thick black smoke formed and a bus captain 
              ran out and frantically waved to get them off the bus while several bus 
              captain tried putting out the fire with fire extinguishers. There were

              <p>Buses uses compressed air for its brakes system, and therefore reving the engines is to build up air in the air tanks. </p>
