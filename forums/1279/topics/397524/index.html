              <p><b>Crush Hour</b></p>
              
              <p>It is more like c-rush hour for Mr Kenneth Ng five mornings a week.</p>
              
              <p>He takes service number 200 from Buona Vista MRT Station to his workplace, a multinational company, in South Buona Vista Road.</p>
              
              <p>Service 200, operated by SBS Transit, is the only one plying the estimated 2km road.</p>
              
              <p>South Buona Vista Road links North Buona Vista and Pasir Panjang roads.</p>
              
              <p>'You can't even get on the bus at the bus stop at the MRT station because it's already packed,' said the 34-year-old engineer.</p>
              
              <p>To beat the space jam, many commuters, including Mr Ng, actually walk to the bus stop before the one at the MRT station to get on the bus.</p>
              
              <p>South Buona Vista Road is home to many private apartments, landed property, technology and manufacturing centres and the National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI).</p>
              
              <p>Another grouse for Mr Ng is the wait of 'up to half an hour sometimes'.</p>
              
              <p>When The Sunday Times visited South Buona Vista Road on a recent evening, it was noted that service 200 buses arrived every 14 to 20 minutes.</p>
              
              <p>The NACLI runs courses which are attended by People's Association staff and grassroots leaders.</p>
              
              <p>A spokesman said the institute occasionally gets feedback from participants regarding the infrequent bus service. It has given feedback to the authorities.</p>
              
              <p>The Public Transport Council (PTC) told The Sunday Times that bus services are planned and scheduled by the bus operators, according to passenger demand.</p>
              
              <p>What the PTC does is to ensure that the operators meet service standards, it said.</p>
              
              <p>Is there a case for more buses to serve that particular route? Ms Tammy Tan, senior vice-president, corporate communications, at SBS Transit, said service 200 is one of its less popular routes.</p>
              
              <p>'It has an average daily ridership of only 2,300, compared to as many as 38,500 for other routes,' she said.</p>
              
              <p>Some people have resorted to taking taxis.</p>
              
              <p>Madam Rosmah Khamis, 45, a secretary who was visiting a mosque along the road, said: 'I'll just take a cab when I am here because it's faster.'</p>
              
              <p>Some residents have opted to cycle or walk, as in the case of Ms Lynn Foster, 28.</p>
              
              <p>'It's much faster; the bus takes forever to come and during peak periods, you can't even get on.'</p>
              
              <p>She said the non-peak frequency for this route is 15 to 17 minutes and that during morning peak hours, it is seven and 16 minutes.</p>
              
              <p>Ms Tan added that, 'based on our experience, buses are sometimes unboardable because passengers crowd the front, refusing to move to the rear. This is something we are trying to rectify through education'.</p>
              
              <p>She said that SBS Transit will continue to monitor travel patterns of its passengers and make service changes where necessary.</p>
