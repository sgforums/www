            <div class='col-md body'>What to do la? That's how they take buses during their time. Squeeze as long as can squeeze. Stand at the door and hang on to dear life. Old habits die hard, especially if you're over 40. The older you get, the harder it is to change. So for us youngsters, its better that we give in. No point arguing with them. Just tell yourself that you would never become like that auntie/uncle when you grow old and teach your children to be polite. Being angry and trying to get even doesn't help at all. If needed, just tell them in a polite manner. You will be surprised at how well it works. Never scold them. We have to give the elders due respect. Keep in mind that what goes around comes around and one fine day, you might be the auntie/uncle at the receiving end of a tongue lashing youngster.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I don't see the point of this thread at all. It *is* easy for a passenger in the bus to get frustrated why the auntie doesn't want to wait for the next bus and insist on squeezing because he is already in the bus. On the squeezer perspective, he/she might already missed the previous few buses cos its so full the doors can't open. Wait for next bus and end up missing some more buses? With operators (esp SMRTB) putting feeder services at 15mins frequency during peak hours, it isn't really a good option?<br><br>Yes, sometimes one doesn't know why the aunties keep squeezing although a second bus is approaching. But, nobody knows whether the approaching bus is full, or will it even stop at the bus stop. I have seen many cases where the second bus which is mostly empty stop just long enough to drop alighting pax and overtake the bus in front - even with the driver knowing that pax can't get on board the first.<br><br>Being almost late or already late, its just desperation trying to get on board the bus. And the problem is definitely not confined to just aunties, office workers, school children, uncles etc all squeeze (me included!). I agree, speaking to them nicely instead of glaring or speaking to them aggressively helps. Most of them are very nice and would sometimes tell u why they are so adamant on squeezing on board.</div>
