The economies of scale of profitting from a bus is at least 30% (that's what i deduce) of the capacity. With DDs running at least 80% pax load on the express sector, SBST would obviously profit more from these services due<br>1. lower fuel consumption<br>2. high pax load<br>3. pax paying fares with at least $1.28 (S168 last stop Woodlands to Jln Kayu - 17 FS)</div>
