However, whether they have enough buses to cover all the buses back at the depot is one problem.<br><br>As for 12m buses and single deck buses, it is easier to for the bus captain or service captain (Tibs) to be aware of the problem. However, for double decker buses and Bendy Buses, the problems often lie with the upper deck and the trailer where the driver seldom goes to.<br><br>Sometimes even for a normal bus, the driver seldom go to the back of the bus and most of the time the bus has it's engine off or the bus is stationary so it's almost impossible for them to note the problem.<br><br>To solve this problem, the best way is to feedback to the respective bus company and / or driver about the condition of the bus. You can also approach staffs of each bus company at respective interchanges. However, please note down the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">date, time, service number and the bus registration number</span></strong>. These are few important information for the company to call back the involved bus.</div>

The Lances' problem is more of the bodywork design (aircon ducting too high up).<br><br>(IMO) For TIBS, the warmest will be those CAC 0405s.

The loud howls on Strider B10Ms are due to the fanbelt, poor maintainance obviously. I agree their aircon is also very warm, but O405s take the cake!<br><br>Coldest a/c has to be Scania N113CRB.</div>

The back is warmer than the front probably because of the seating density, and the seating used.
