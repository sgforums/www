              <p>Instead, when it came to Saturday’s premiere of Showtime’s second All
               Access: Mayweather vs. Maidana episode—prior to its “Heavy Hitters” 
              fight broadcast from Carson, California—the best line of the night came 
              from, of all people, veteran family tree actor Marlon Wayans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mayweathervsmaidanaliveppv.com/">©(PPV)™MAYWEATHER VS MAIDANA LIVE STREAM ONLINE BOXING SHOWTIME ON 3 MAY,2014</a> </span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p>“What person that speaks Spanish are you going to beat up on this time?” Wayans said.</p>
              <p>Though it doesn’t give Maidana—the reigning WBA welterweight 
              champion—the credit he deserves for the status he’s earned, the query 
              from the A Haunted House 2 star does illustrate the basic storyline of 
              each of the docudrama’s three incarnations since Mayweather signed with 
              Showtime 14 month ago.</p>

              <p>And as it was for Mexican wannabes Robert Guerrero and Saul Alvarez 
              preceding him, the tale being spun for Money’s rugged Argentine is one 
              of a back-to-basics father wading into the pool owned by the flashy, 
              opulent and unapologetically brash five-division and pound-for-pound 
              kingpin.’I am a champion and I am ready to fight for my title,’ said 
              Maidana. ‘Most importantly, I am preparing to beat Mayweather. The last 
              thing that I’m worried about is my title. I want to just train and beat 
              Mayweather.</p>
              <p>‘This is the most important part of my career. The fight with Adrien 
              Broner gave me a lot of exposure, but this fight itself is the biggest 
              fight of my career and it would be a tremendous upset and that’s what 
              I’m training for, to upset the world and to do it for my country. It 
              would be huge for my country.’</p>
              <p>Going into the fight Maidana is regarded as a huge underdog, yet, 
              against Broner last December he was in the same position before his 
              brutal annihilation left the man tipped as the next star of boxing truly
               humbled.</p>
              <p>And again, the Santa Fe assassin insists his role as the dark horse only makes him more determined to succeed.</p>
              <p>‘It doesn’t bother me at all [what people say],’ he added. ‘What 
              motivates me is that if I win, I’m going to beat the best in the world 
              and that’s what motivates me. I’m going to go out to win it.</p>
              <p>‘If others haven’t been able to do it, I’m training to do it. I’m 
              training to be the first one to do it.’Where there are men in physical 
              conflict, there are always profiteers on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>Back in action for the first time since trouncing Mexican superstar 
              “Canelo” Alvarez, boxing’s pound-for-pound king, Floyd Mayweather Jr. 
              returns to the scene of the crime, MGM Grand Garden Arena, this Saturday
               night (May, 3, 2014) when he takes on Argentine bruiser Marcos Maidana,
               who last seen thumping “Money” understudy Adrien Broner.</p>
              <p>MMAmania will have LIVE coverage of “Mayweather vs. Maidana,” 
              starting with the Showtime pay-per-view (PPV) at 9 p.m. ET. As is 
              customary, the bookies have pulled out all the stops, providing a 
              plethora of options for the enterprising gambler.Mayweather, the sport’s
               undisputed pound-for-pound king got noticeably choked up while thanking
               many of the members of his team that aren’t household names and often 
              get overlooked.</p>
              <p>He quizzically asked the assembled media if anyone would be able to 
              solve the “Mayvinci” code in the ring, and pointed out that he’s gotten 
              used to hearing the litany of reasons why a certain fighter would be the
               one to beat him.</p>
              <p>Be it good power, good speed or a good jab, Mayweather pointed out that he’s beaten every single person placed in front of him.</p>
              <p>Earlier at the press conference, the pound-for-pound king announced a
               $15,000 dollar donation to the Susan G. Komen Foundation to assist 
              breast cancer survivors, and that he would be bringing 46 survivors of 
              breast cancer to the fight as his guests.</p>
