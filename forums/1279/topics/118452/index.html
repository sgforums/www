The rests are nonsense acts by drivers.<br><br>Svc 72 is not the only service with drivers of such actions, svc 157 is also another one.<br><br>Well, one possible reason for Svc 72 drivers for giving this type of driving attitude is that Svc 72 buses are too many, often arrive in 2 or 3 buses together, regardless peak or off peak hours.<br><br>As for Svc 157, 157 routes practically have no jams ( accept for Lornie Rd towards Bkt. Timah Rd in morning peak hours ), and also the traffic lights along Jurong East / West Ave 1. The rest of the route is congestion free for most of the time, svc 157 drivers drove slowly, so that they followed their assigned schedule and reach the int as planned.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SBS3624G,<br><br>Point no 5<br><br>You probably have not been on a bus where the driver is already late but still wait for the elders to sit before driving off. It should NEVER be classified as a tactic to waste time. In fact, it is this kind of acts that make a smooth journey. Wait till you become old, then see whether you will like it if the driver just move off and there you are, falling face flat onto the floor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, no, no, you guys have mistaken what I have meant. You guys have apparently failed to notice that I have gone to great lengths to emphasise that these drivers are kind souls, but they also make use of these incidents to waste time. I have never said that waiting for people is wrong, neither did I say that waiting for ah pek is wrong!<br><br>And you say only point 5 is true, say rather you are telling that to a person who takes 72 everyday at various times. You cannot say I am lying. I have seen too many of such cases. Take for example, I was taking yet another slow DD, 9199C. The bus stopped abruptly after crossing the traffic light when he saw the light turn yellow. Some guy behind me tcked damn loud and kicked my chair so hard I tumbled out of the seat! I tell you I am very fed up with such drivers bcos either me or my belongings become casualties.<br><br>And PJ_Quek, 72 seldom arrives 2 or 3 at a time, that was last time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> These days, the 72 frequency is 5min at peak hr and up to 15min on normal hrs.<br><br>Anyway, I hope I have not offended you guys, I am only trying to put my point through.</div>
