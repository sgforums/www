              <p>
              </p><p>i saw on TV news today with amusement that SMRT is going green with buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i did some small research and found that singapore did not revise our low engine emission standards since euro 2 (am i right on this point? im not quite sure)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>any bus depot we see in operation today is lined with engine soot. engine soot is a clear indication of poor engine combustion performance. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i will like to draw LTA/NEA to the attention,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) what is the side effect of long term human exposure/ingestion of engine soot?</p>
              <p>2) why are public transport engines emission standards so low? especially buses because ALL our bus depots are black lined with soot, it cannot be the work of only 1 broken bus missing maintenance.</p>
              <p>3) what measures are in place to ensure the public is not harmed by these poorly maintained vehicles?</p>
              <p>4) who are the balance and check bodies that will keep this in motion?</p>
              <p>5) which governmental check is in place to ensure that SMRT DO NOT acquire vehicles with lousy engines and who is the balance and check for that? THEY are indirectly spending public funds are they not?</p>
              <p>6) the interior condition of buses are lined with cobwebs and air vents lined with black soot, indication of lack of maintenance for at least 3 months.</p>
              <p>7) because this is something that affects millions locally, how can this be accountable to the public? and who is the balance and check entity to ring the bell and watch for public interests?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is my questions interesting? anyone care to plus minus add divide ... etc feel free</p>

              <p>Anyway, have you heard of annual inspection for vehicles by LTA, which checks for exhaust smoke amongst other things?</p>
              <p>The black stuffs accumulated in air-conditioning vents are not soot, but dust! That's the reason all air-conditioners (vehicle or building it's the same) come with a purifier to remove dust brought in from outside the bus to minimise the dust from finding its way to the air-con duct, hence ensuring that the vents do not turn dusty for 6 months to a year. For your information, soot will not find its way into the aircon duct through the engine compartment!</p>
              <p>It is a fact that diesel engines on a similar rating as a petrol-powered engine is less environmentally-friendly, and hence the diesel tax. However, it is impossible &amp; uneconomical to produce engines powerful enough to propel a bus by using petrol. I'm sure you're not insisting that transporting a busload of people by car is more environmentally friendly and efficient?</p>
