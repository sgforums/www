              <p>  More of sharing of experiences you had during bus accidents and bus breakdowns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Not from me but actually more from my father who told me this one years ago. Happened in Hougang quite some time ago when a SBS (then) Bus got into an accident with a schoolkid who was rushing past the traffic light when it was showing the red man. The SBS bus hit the boy head on and the boy was flung a few metres away from the bus and died instantly. Pretty scary though</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  As for bus breakdowns my first and only (lucky!) breakdown was with TIB1049L last year when the electronics of the bus suddenly failed and all the lights went off. SL restarted bus a few times but didn't work. The exit doors were half opened so when the SL announced the breakdown people just kicked on the plug doors to make them open while the SL headed to the back to open up the engine cover and place the triangle. Passengers were then transferred to TIB1106E of 913</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  So if you have any of such experiences (especially so for Accidents) why not share with us. Its pretty rare we have people who had actually been through a bus accident so just tell us how was the situation like that you have been through</p>

              <p>For me, i think almost all of you should have already know about the infamous 1st August TIB648P accident on 985.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, driver was speeding like around 60 km/h along Kallang Industrial Park area. Only 3 people was on the bus. Then, the driver tried to brake as there was a red light but a van was right infront of the bus. The driver braked but it was too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bus hit the van at around 20 km/h. Damage of the van was horrible but the bus suffered dents and a shattered windscreen. The van driver and the bus driver argued at who is to blame for the accident. A duo of SMRT Inspectors arrived by chance only 2 minutes after the incident occured as they were doing their regular ticket check on a Sv 853 UMW Lance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The inspectors looked for witnesses and they asked me for evidence. The driver alerted OCC beforehand about the incident. I was taken on board the bus for interogattion with the 2 SMRT Inspectors. I told them that the bus was at fault since it was a red light and the bus was trying to stop from 60 km/h. The bus was driven to the Geylang Lor 1 Terminal to contact the OCC by phone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was later decided to bring the bus back to depot for repairs. The bus was driven back to depot with the windscreen shattered and missing a side mirror. I continued on with my regular programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The bus was repaired within 2 weeks and is back on service. The driver is currently driving TIB677E on 985 perm A shift.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My experience wasn't an accident or a breakdown but a technical error on the bus itself.</p>
              <p>It was a few years back already....</p>
              <p>I was taking a MB O405 (WA) svc 97 to Selegie Road's Peace Centre for tuition. The bus had problems with the doors at the rear. Every time the bus driver pressed the door closing button, the doors would close but the "Door Closing" sign remains and a loud shriek that accompanies the sign persisted. As a result, the BC had to reopen the door and close it about 3-4 times at each bus-stop that the passenger alighted. Until the bus reaches AYE, after 3 to 4 times, the bus remained stubborn and the loud high-pitch sound persisted even when the BC reopened and closed the doors after 5 times. As a result, he had to leave his seat and manually close the door. As passengers, knowing that he had to drive and close the rear door after the passenger alight, we decided to exit from the front door since then.</p>

              <p>long time ago i took one VO3x batch 1 on 99 from school to home then breakdown before Hua Yi Sec, i looked outside window and saw green fluids flowing out from the bus, covering 2 lanes and the motorists had to splash over it. BC opened the rear engine cos overheated. all passengers had to alight but the card reader is not in breakdown mode, and my card value was deducted in normal. then took 98 to go home lol.</p>
              <p>i also remember another breakdown which happens at 9611D which also serving S99 that time. heng ah, the card reader was converted to breakdown mode, otherwise my card value would hve deducted in normal. Cause of breakdown is the engine overheated. i boarded 9237B to complete my journey which is the bus after 9611D. the breakdown occurs at Cooperation Rd.</p>

              <p>breakdown hex 003</p>
              <p>SBS600U on 163. Around May this year. Bus was on Upp Thomson Rd towards Sengkang when the engine began whining loudly. BC brought the bus to a stop at the next bus stop and the engine gave out smoke. Dad, mom and I were on the bus, transferred to a PVC seat Merc on 855 to go to Yio Chu Kang Rd.</p>
              <p>breakdown hex 004</p>
              <p><strong>SBS8031J on 17. </strong>31/10 2008, bus was travelling from Bedok Int back to Pasir Ris Int when it stopped at the traffic light at Simei Rd near the Simei St 3 junction. Engine suddenly stopped. BC could restart it, but gearbox jammed. Tried for a few mins, then declared breakdown and we remained on the bus until the next sv17 arrived. I was with my friends when it happened, the bus behind us was SBS8337C cameo from sv33.</p>

              <p>Near misses are always for me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) TIB1066L was the bus before mine. Took TIB878S and found TIB1066L broke down at the next bus stop. Was running for TIB1066L initially</p>
              <p>2) TIB1245L broke down at the next bus stop. Was on TIB878S which is again behind the bus which broke down</p>
              <p>3) TIB1181L last year. The bus apparently starts decelerating when it reaches a certain speed at the Aft 888 Plaza bus stop and the ride was slow. It made it till the interchange and I didn't know what happened after that. Eventually broke down a few days later</p>
              <p>4) TIB1139K broke down at the bus stop before my school. Apparently I didn't board it although it was the 1st sv 911 bus I saw at the interchange because I was waiting for TIB1225U, which was the bus behind. From what I heard it broke down due to Brake failure. That didn't end the bus from breaking down again this year; in fact the bus broke down 8 days later, 2 bus stops earlier at the same trip.</p>

              <p>Hey, me too..</p>
              <p>I remembered 1 time when I took a KUB on svc 130 &amp; the BC ALMOST hit the bicycle in front and horned loudly, sounds more like a train horn lol. The ppl in the bus was like traumatised (especially me!) coz i was msging my fren abt my trip when suddenly the bus braked hard and my phone flew to the other seat and fell to the floor (and of coz the phone batt and its cover fell off too)! I frantically searched the parts of my phone like hell coz the lights werent on.. That was like the most embarassing moment in the bus coz every1 was like looking at me..</p>

              <p>Here's one accident I can clearly remember. The most prominent, especially since the accident took place on the last day of CSS's revenue service on Friday, 27 April 2007.</p>
              <p>So it was about time for the last CSS bus to depart from Bedok Interchange (CSS 0195K). I was standing at the 608 berth waiting to see it depart.</p>
              <p>Timecheck: 1928 hrs. While I was waiting for that bus to leave, I suddenly heard a loud bang coming from behind me. I turned and I saw that there was an accident involving SBS 0420Y (26) and SBS 2803M (32). Both buses went back into the bus bay.</p>
              <p>On closer inspection, I immediately saw that the windscreen of SBS 0420Y was damaged. It's front cover had also disloged as well. I couldn't see what's at the back of SBS 2803M, though there seemed to be completely no damage to the bus (I saw this bus cameoing on Express 518 the next day). Some SLs and the transit security were seen hovering around SBS 0420Y and there were about two people taking photos of the damage.</p>
              <p>The passengers of Service 26 were transfered to the next available bus, SBS 0135X. I forgot what happened to the Service 32 passengers.</p>
