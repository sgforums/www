              <p>while i agree with that, i feel there is still a need to have some trade-off between WAB space and normal pax space. two PIW spaces on the bus might be good for, say, two friends, both PIW, travelling together (im not saying two PIW strangers trying to get on the same WAB bus, just two <span style="font-style: italic;">friends </span>together<span style="font-style: italic;">), </span>which has a<span style="font-style: italic;"> very </span>low chance of occuring, but having two such PIW spaces will cause inconvenience to the majority of the other people. i believe the most fair way would be to have a few buses with 2 spaces and some with just 1, but with those with 1 space in a higher proportion, this will convenience both PIWs and normal pax alike.</p>

              <p>definitely it would be very difficult for the BC to persuade people to get down the bus, especially everyone rushing home for dinner etc... I dare to say that I myself will have to consider the circumstance before i think whether to alight the bus to give way to the PIW. It's not the cost that matter coz I'm using BCP (not Bus Captian Pass <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">). But I want to say sth which is that I'm not disrespecting PIW or what... just that I might be in a rush of time. Don't forget, to allow PIW to enter the pass, the way from the rear exit to the PIW area has to be cleared. Maybe even 10 people have to exit. The BC will have a hard time.</p>

              <p>for this scenario, it should be a law saying that if a PIW wants to get on a WAB bus on a WAB service, those nearest the exit door MUST get off to wait for alternative bus services and failure to do so will be a criminal offence. The pax will also not be at a disadvantage with his ride cancelled and a choice of alternative bus svcs (although does not apply to every situtation; for example single-service areas). This results in a win-win situation for everyone</p>

              <p>true, there is time spent, but overall it still enables the PIW to fit on. we can split up the group of people into individuals to board different buses; we cant do that with PIWs. thats why such a strict rule is necessary.</p>

              <p>for this scenario, it should be a law saying that if a PIW wants
                  to get on a WAB bus on a WAB service, those nearest the exit door
                  MUST get off to wait for alternative bus services and failure to do
                  so will be a criminal offence. The pax will also not be at a
                  disadvantage with his ride cancelled and a choice of alternative
                  bus svcs (although does not apply to every situtation; for example
                  single-service areas). This results in a win-win situation for

              <p>I don't see the logic here. If the bus is already full, it's full. Even if the passenger is not PIW, he cannot board simply because he cannot squeeze in. Our buses are always on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
              <p>Most passengers fill up the area before the steps leading to the rear, while the rear is practically empty. If the bus is full because of this, then maybe BC can go to exit door and persuade people to move in before letting the PIW in.</p>

              <p>my perfect WAB bus<br><br>1) zero step to the rear<br><br>2) vertically placed air pressure and air systems at front. ave space but higher obstructions in front. . adding approx 4 seats on both sides. <br><br>3) PIW area shifted to left hand side. Standing area also on left area near to the door. (approx 4 seats added on other side). one PIW area with safety belt. <br><br>4) Sturdy seperation panel between backward facing seat on doorside. Seperate sitting pax and the PIW area.</p>
              <p>5) 3 fold up seats at PIW area. <br><br>If use Gemilang seating plan thats 29 add 8. 37 seating with 3 fold up for a total of 40 seating. close to the normal 42 seater coaches.</p>
              <p>6) use of above held plug door instead of bus height running pole to hold plug door. essentially this trasnforms the plug door into an air tight seal lug door, preserving air-con also. (For example check Citaro or ALD Enviro 200 dart doors)</p>
              <p>7) with zero step all the way means bus will need to use a vertically placed engine. either to left of bus or right. this means losing one or two rear seats . man lion's City got zero step all the way version anot?</p>
              <p>8) better placed wheelchair bell in a slight groove on a holding pole at standee area acustomed to PIW height. so that no one else cna touch the bell. b9TL wheelchair  bell is an good exmaple.</p>

              <p>your calculations have a bit of a flaw. Having a vertically placed engine, even though it may lose one or two rear seats, however being totally flat there is an added advantage of flexibility of adding maybe one more row, meaning there can be 4 extra seats in trade-off for the 1 or 2 lost, so the net change is still +2 or +3</p>
