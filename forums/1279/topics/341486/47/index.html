                  1st day he might also appears simple as tat.. i'm very sure close to 90% of the bus fans will take the yutong bus on the 1st day it arrive on the service, just like the same concept as other demos like SBS8030L (Volvo B7RLE)or SBS8031J (MAN bus), so to avoid this problem from happening, you should take the yutog bus at a later date or postpone to another date of ur choice.

                                      <p>"People are willing to give that chance, but what we see here is
                                      the lack of effort to catch it. Once the chance it's over, I am
                                      sorry but its really gone. Its hard for a second opportunity to
                                      appear."</p>
                                      <p>"It's not only YOU, in this world, you can't say that there's no
                                      one can stop you. If you really want to be like that, I won't stop
                                      you. My best suggestion is that, when police visit you for any
                                      event, just tell them that no one has the right to stop you.</p>
                                      <p>You need to practice self control."</p>
                                      <p>"there is a reason why there are bus fans who flamed you and
                                      tolerated you. there were remedies which would have worked and
                                      which now you can still use to rectify the problem, but you didn't
                                      use them."</p>
                                      <p>Well we did give him chances.</p>

                                      ohh.. i see. He makes empty promises. Each time he makes mistakes, he apologies publicly into this forum but a few weeks later he started again and the cycle repeats all over again. What do you expect? No trust towards the bus fans, No proper decorum/etiquette during any bus rides or spottings, be it new sMB1h OC or scania buses, and No sign of remorse when bus fans reprimanding him regardless of how many times and he's becoming ignorant frequently. The public has complained, the BC has complains as well, and remedial action might be taken some day, should the BC really complains to the HQs of the relevant public bus companies (be it SBS or SMRT). So I shall one day see his shameless stories on the BUSWAY Magazine published by SBS. This is the time for him to bear the consequences of what he had did so far.<br><br>There are many reasons as to why bus fans disliked him as a result, I will not mention in full details. I've seen all his troubles since last year. Yet he doesn't want to change his own ways (from what other bus fans had pointed out), although last year I kept mum on certain issues. Its not that I want to badmouth someone else, but he needs the change instead of blaming other parties for the course of his actions. People do take time to change themselves so that they can be improved, but if he go against it, more bus fans will like him less and loss of trust on him. Furthermore, I'm not gonna pursue further issues anymore cos there's gonna be a risk that this thread may closed and re-opened. This kind of people cannot be trusted by many local bus fans.<br><br>No point raising this issue again.. he's already down to the very low reputation and has to pay the price for it. You can just don't meet him after all. It's extremely annoying if other people worldwide were to bump on this thread.<br>
