              <p>Yep agreed.</p>
              <p>Can't wait to see the day when one bus fan in the future say "I wait at the bus stop for a service that has full K230UBs. The only difference in the buses i can see is aircon, almost same interior and probably different regos. Oh, and the amount of vibrations within the bus."</p>
              <p>But of course, we all had understood the simplicity of getting one bodywork for maintanience instead of different bodyworks.</p>
              <p>SMRT's OC Gemilang bodywork is still nicer looking with SMRT colours and the Capacity front that hasn't really grown on me yet. and besides, 66 units that's on the roads now within the whole of Singapore's total bus fleet still has the kicks (actually for now less than that because some buses are SP and TRG).</p>
              <p>Also, can't SBST somehow figure out a way to lessen the vibration? I described the bus as modern-ish to one of my bus fan buddy on MSN because the vibrations gives an impression that the bus was on the roads for a long time, and is bringing discomfort to passengers.</p>

              <p>Well, before you moan about it, remember how many Mercedes MB O405s SBS Transit (then SBS) bought in in the early 1990s; I'm sure bus fans then also moaned about the bus being everywhere. SBS then did try to soften the impact by having two different bodyworks for the bus though, and this is something I expect them to do to the Scania K230UBs today.</p>
              <p>Also, I don't think SBS Transit will be just buying K230UBs; I expect them to buy at least two or three more models of single-deck buses after the K230UB; I suspect that SBS Transit may be wanting to buy another demonstrator before making any further commitments, seeing that there's still one space left for the tiny registration range (8030 - 8033) that they had been using for their demonstrators.</p>
