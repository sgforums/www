              The 242 ADD will crossover to 179A/ 179 after 0745.
              
              All 179A duties will do 1 more S179 trip before swing [for the S Shifts]. That's where the 2 mins freq comes from.

              <p>The question is WHY. SBS has been really good in increasing capacity of buses in last few months. They have had multiple higher capacity increase for many services - s5, s43, s52, s55, s72, s76, s86, s88, s90, s94, s98, s109, s157, s163, s174, s225, s334.</p>

              <p>Maybe 74 is already maximised in the number of buses they can give and also the frequency. Just like the case of 190 that they can't really do anything about it? </p>

              <p>Much of 74's pax comes also from SIM, SP, NP, AMK, HG area.</p>
              <p>In fact the whole route less the one near buona vista is nearly full-house even for DD, much less SD, for most of the day and night.</p>
              <p>But quite frankly, 74 is still ok. At least if the SD skips stops, usually a DD comes within 10 min.</p>
              <p>The one that's NOT ok is 72. 15-20 min night frequency when so many people take this service from YCK, HG, Tamp is not ok. And not to mention the horrifically slow driving. Especially off-peak timing. It makes a journey from Tamp to HG at a leisurely 45min at times when car takes only 15min! A ride to Pasir Ris by train, followed by a switch to 88 takes 35min only by contrast.</p>
