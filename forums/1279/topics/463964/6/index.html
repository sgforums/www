              <p>Now you are speaking my language :)</p>
              <p>I know that the load between Sengkang and AMK is very heavy.
              That's why I am rooting for DD on this patch. I have witnessed 159
              buses at Hougang Ave 9 have no place for people to enter anymore,
              and it is the only bus serving Serangoon Ave 6, but passengers
              cannot enter. In the evening, same thing happens at Seagate, when
              passengers cannot board the SD.</p>
              <p>Hence, I feel there should be a 159M using DDs as a full day
              service and 159 can go to TPY with reduced frequency. Or have 159
              return from TPY via CTE instead of Lor Chuan. Everytime I see 159
              people just cramp into the bus. It really needs DDs.</p>
              <p>By the way 163 is a good alternative from Sengkang to TPY as
              well, or just take 50/159 to AMK or Bishan and change into
              connecting bus. Isn't it quicker than taking 159 that does Ave 1,
              Lor Chuan, Bradell to reach TPY.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>163 is NOT a good alt; horrid freq and long routes. Longer than 159. And as I said before, the uncles and aunties may not favour transferring to direct link. </p>
              <p>What I think is that 159 should loop at TPY and not enter TPY Int. That way freq improve, trip faster and more space for TPY Int. I also support the idea of skipping Lor Chuan, as that part is real redundant (duplicating 105 and MRT), thus allowing DDs to ply the route. </p>
              <p>159M IMHO is just waste of resources, road space and manpower (to manage that service) given the above is granted. </p>

              <p>Actually 163's route is only maybe 5 minutes longer than 159. I always take 163 direct from Sengkang to TPY too. hah</p>
              <p>And 163's frequency has improved alot already, what it needs to do is the frequency of non peak hours. The wait can be up to 25 mins which i think is ridiculous. During peak hours, you can easily board 163 within 10 minutes. </p>
              <p>For 159, i guess it's more like a connecting bus rather than a direct. yup as what busanalyser has mentioned, 50 to AMK then take train to TPY is already a much faster alternative from sengkang as compared to 159 and 163. </p>

              <p>I asked my neighbours who go to TPY too. They will mostly prefer 159 to 163. Freq is still 159 win. Actually 163 can be fast too, but only during evening off-peak, when traffic at YCK Road reduces. </p>
              <p>As I have repeated so frequently, uncles and aunties, such as my neighbour's grandmother, don't care about the length of 159 (as long as it's faster than 163) and they would rather a seat and a direct link bus. Thus taking 159 direct is what they would always do of course. </p>
              <p>I think it's the other way round bah. People on 163 tend to be the short-haul ones. Not much will take from Sengkang Int to TPY. On the other hand, 159 had one-third or even sometimes half the bus going to TPY &lt;---&gt; Sengkang Int. </p>

              <p>By doing so you are missing out on pax from TPY Interchange. I am sure someone would complain about that as well, as they would want a direct service from TPY Interchange to Sengkang Central and even if there is an alternate service like 163, they would want a shorter route.</p>

              <p>pls lah.. you been  observing the loading? seem like every service u go observe one trip and say must put DDs or what?  like that call observation? based on you so called observation, you DID NOT even know that there are downroutes for Sv72 in the afternoon?  have been looking at all your comments since you registered your account, you simply just whack whatever you like... only know how to propose to add DDs to this and that service.. but do not know the actual operation details at all...</p>

              <p>I asked my neighbours who go to TPY too. They will mostly prefer 159 to 163. Freq is still 159 win. Actually 163 can be fast too, but only during evening off-peak, when traffic at YCK Road reduces. </p>
              <p>As I have repeated so frequently, uncles and aunties, such as my neighbour's grandmother, don't care about the length of 159 (as long as it's faster than 163) and they would rather a seat and a direct link bus. Thus taking 159 direct is what they would always do of course. </p>
              <p>I think it's the other way round bah. People on 163 tend to be the short-haul ones. Not much will take from Sengkang Int to TPY. <strong>On the other hand, 159 had one-third or even sometimes half the bus going to TPY &lt;---&gt; Sengkang Int. </strong></p>

              <p>With your this post, I have serious doubts on how many times you have travelled from Sengkang to TPY. My cousin lives at Buangkok and I have taken 159 several times. What you have mentioned is so untrue.</p>
              <p>In the morning peak, the bus is already standing when I board at Buangkok Green, by Hougang Ave 9, people don't have place to enter. I have seen many times, people near Hougang 1 taking 72 behind and changing into 159 on AMK Ave 5 to AMK MRT. By the time, the bus reaches Nanyang, there are only 25 - 30 of the 70 - 75 pax at Seagate remaining.</p>
              <p>At AMK MRT, at least 15-20 pax get down, and another 5 enter. The bus normally leaves AMK MRT with not more than 20 pax. I have even observed this in the afternoon timing. When at AMK MRT, when people get down there are not more than 10-15 pax (not counting pax who enter), how does it be one-third or half pax going direct from Sengkang to TPY. If at all, it would be just 1 or 2 pax - you and your grandmother's friend.</p>
              <p>If you'll agree to spend 5 minutes more on 163 that has not-so-bad frequency as you claim, you will see that 159 route from AMK to TPY is quite useless and redundant and even time consuming.</p>

              <p><br>Agree. I thought this service would have got at least 2-3 DDs by now but maybe because half its route is similar to svc 76 from YCK to stop before Daikin (AMK Ave 3), SBST is not using DDs. That is the only rationale I can think.</p>

              <p>Please... many of you over here think that you'll own the forum and are so touchy about small things... IF someone uses a wrong reg number, you'll will start shouting at them... I don't care who favors me a not... I just do this as a hobby... have many other things to do... so can't take your reactions too seriously...</p>
              <p>Regarding credibility, you'll decide that as per your convenience... I have seen so many of your posts where you just write rubbish.. especially in the DDs for SMRT forum... just because you want to favor bendies... Anyway, IMO apart from 3-4 people here who are senior, no one has credibility and everyone gets flamed when their point of view is different.</p>
              <p>Again your point over 159 having one third or half people from Sengkang to TPY is rubbish because by the time the bus comes to AMKAve 1, there are only 15-20 pax remaining in the bus that gets more than 70 pax, and many of these are ones who have taken the bus at AMK MRT. And don't take this all too seriously, just because I want or a couple of people want 159 to be re-routed via CTE or have 159M, it is not going to happen. So enjoy your long ride from Sengkang to TPY.</p>
