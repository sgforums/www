              <p>No seriously.</p>
              <p>If the idea behind the duopoly was to benchmark operators against one another, then SMRT must be seriously deluded if they want to sink investments in more bendies when its clear that its not tenable.</p>
              <p>Like the fan-boys.</p>
              <p>To put more simply, if LTA wants to shake up the bus competition scene and implement some tendering process, then the bendies are just standing in the way when clearly the infrastructure doesnt support them.</p>

              <p>come to thinking TIBS should not even get bendies buses in the first place. But some of it bus route it ply high cannot for DD bus too bad. I am sure bendy bus can loop at toa payoh interchange. TPY not readly crowded. maybe sbst should withdraw 159 and extend 50 to TPY. </p>

              <p>There are too many constraints. If 159 to use bendies, transfer to SMRT or make SBST buy - both unlikely. Loading for 159 poor between TPY and AMK. Also many alternatives available. </p>
              <p>Easy option - deploy DDs and make 159 loop at AMK as 159M - this is more doable. </p>

              <p>I think in next set of non-BSEP Wright registration, more WAB DDs will be deployed on svc 70. I don't think SBS wants to introduce more SDs on its cash cow routes. But I agree for PIW passengers, it must be irritating to wait for WAB bus, but luckily alternatives like 43, 76 are available, which are almost full fleet WAB.</p>

So when i ask the drive he said the old leyland DD has broke down. But why SBST still use old bus when this peak hour timing when this time need a new DD bus? I can see many new DD on service 5 not really full during peak hour. And also yesterday afternoon 6 105 buses came at the same time aournd 5 plus to six in toa payoh. wait for one 59 take a long time alway pack to the door with SD bus. </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>59 is one of the most neglected services by SBST. It needs 50% DD fleet as well as fleet add to improve frequency.</p>

              too bad. I am sure bendy bus can loop at toa payoh interchange. TPY
              not readly crowded. maybe sbst should withdraw 159 and extend 50 to

              <p>159 is exclusive operator of SGN North Ave 6, and easiest solution for Sheng Siong ppl. Freq is WAY better than 163 and route-wise is faster than 88. Additionally, 88 doesn't reach Sengkang Ctrl, and MRT is not fast enough. </p>

              <p>No la... TPY interchange already crowded.... No space for bendy,

              <p>How many times have you taken 159? Do you even know the loading pattern? 159 almost gets empty at AMK Ave 5, and it still has seated capacity till AMK. The bus gets almost empty here, and then there are few people boarding / alighting. Again the load increases on Bradell road to TPY but that completely depends on which bus comes first. There are alternatives and many 28, 73, 105, 153, 155 to TPY from Bradell road or even Lor Chuan.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking AMK -TPY is under demand, but please spare a thought for long-haul passengers like me. We people depend 159 to get us to TPY at a time faster than any other alternatives to TPY from Sengkang. And demand at Hougang can get out of control most of the time too. Serving as the only way to get to the core to Sengkang Ctrl at HG Ave 9/ SGN North Ave 5/6, people tend to push their way into the tiny B10M/Citaros. Thus, given the worst conditions, by the time the bus reaches HG Ave 4 it will FLY STOP. </p>
              <p>Also, take a look at TPY (not interchange) from 3pm onwards. Dying load as all the uncles and aunties board the bus. I can see that 1/3 of the people in the bus stop all swamp to the bus. This is to Sengkang btw. </p>
              <p>One more. Take a look at the Sengkang side to TPY. Oh, all those people returning to HG. Don't know if it's coincidence or not, but I realised 4/5 of 159's buses are timed just nicely ahead of 161's buses. So what happens? The reason 161 still have load to HG during evening peak is because 159's tiny buses cannot fit in all the pax sometimes. During afternoon off peak if this happens, 161 won't have much load at all. </p>

              <p>Now you are speaking my language :)</p>
              <p>I know that the load between Sengkang and AMK is very heavy. That's why I am rooting for DD on this patch. I have witnessed 159 buses at Hougang Ave 9 have no place for people to enter anymore, and it is the only bus serving Serangoon Ave 6, but passengers cannot enter. In the evening, same thing happens at Seagate, when passengers cannot board the SD.</p>
              <p>Hence, I feel there should be a 159M using DDs as a full day service and 159 can go to TPY with reduced frequency. Or have 159 return from TPY via CTE instead of Lor Chuan. Everytime I see 159 people just cramp into the bus. It really needs DDs.</p>
              <p>By the way 163 is a good alternative from Sengkang to TPY as well, or just take 50/159 to AMK or Bishan and change into connecting bus. Isn't it quicker than taking 159 that does Ave 1, Lor Chuan, Bradell to reach TPY.</p>
