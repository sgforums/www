              <p>Well, although i stand on the same side as you with regards to smrtb giving up their operations, its for a slightly different reason. My reason being that it is simply unacceptable for a major rail company to own a bus operations with overlapping service areas anywhere in the world.</p>
              <p>I give a simple example. For e.g, from yishun, If the trains towards city are packed, there's always a slighly slower alternative (857). The concern here is that because smrt rather concentrate on making their trains pack more ppl, they neglate the buses. If 857 was operated by another company, it is very likely they may increase the frequency by adding more vehicles to snatch some of the load from the trains. But this does <strong>not</strong> happen when smrtb is in control because they can earn more from packing more people into trains!</p>
              <p>This is not the same with sbst, because their rail operations is only within the neast boundary, and does not extend island wide. Another example is that, even the MTRC bus services in N.T HK do not overlap with their train services, they merely assist to expand the train's reach to areas not within their stations.</p>
              <p>If this is not easy to understand, another way to put it is simply that areas such as yishun, sembawang, woodlands, bpj, cck, bb are all basically stuck in a monopoly, with smrt controlling almost all transportation options. This is very unacceptable imo.</p>

              <p>Also, it may be a simple solution, but as someone previously mentioned in this forum, its not easy to simply kickout or replace smrtb with a new company in a short period of time. Time is needed to train mechanics, and support staff. Time is also needed to setup depots. Inheriting the old company directly may also bring over the old practices, so this option should be considered carefully.</p>
              <p>Yes, i totally <strong>agree</strong> that if the public transport in that area is so effective, no one will want to drive, but this is in theory. In reality and as you've probably learnt in econs, people (demand) takes time to change, if u already owned a car, would you leave the car lying in the carpark just because the public transport is so efficient? (supply shot up, demand needs time to catch up) If you have driven to work and enjoyed the convienience, its not easy to adapt and change back to public transport as it appears in theory. In fact, if u drive to work everyday and everywhere you go, you might even forget the mrt system map. Its not even hard to find examples of this, try asking relatives or friends who drives everywhere they go.</p>
              <p>And lastly, regarding 966. It's true that with a terminating point (instead of a loop) there will be some improvements to the stability of the frequency. But remember that terminating points only acts as a buffer. Once this buffer is breached, its still possible to end up with haywire frequency. And, its not very fair to compare 36,161,168,502,518,857 to 966. They dont even run on the same expressway. As for 190, 190 only uses 10km of expressway, 966 uses nearly 24km to marine parade (of which nearly 17km of pie is prone to jam) and 190's freq is better. A service that might be used for comparison is 506 which uses 20km of pie. <strong>But</strong>, its not a looping service, so unless you are boarding from bedok reservoir onwards to UEC, you wont get affected. (of course this is subjected to the buffer time at terminal not being breached)</p>

              <p>SMRT has a bad reputation . There must be a good reason why...its as simple as that.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Its perception and practice and not plain theory that makes this impression and SMRT fails miserably in that.</p>
              <p>I dont think my friends would even dream of taking 965 again after I pointed out going that way to Sembawang would be faster than taking 161 to Woodlands and switching to NS line. Definitely not after waiting for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">35 min</span> on a crowded weekend. Nope. I dont care if the svc loops or what. If it sucks, it sucks. And 161 has <span style="color: #ff0000;">DD</span>s to boot. What has 965 have?</p>

              <p>SMRT has a bad reputation . There must be a good reason
                  why...its as simple as that.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Its perception and practice and not plain theory that makes this
                  impression and SMRT fails miserably in that.</p>
              <p>I dont think my friends would even dream of taking 965 again
                  after I pointed out going that way to Sembawang would be
                  faster than taking 161 to Woodlands and switching to NS line.
                  Definitely not after waiting for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">35 min</span> on a crowded weekend.
                  Nope. I dont care if the svc loops or what. If it sucks, it sucks.
                  And 161 has <span style="color: #ff0000;">DD</span>s to boot. What
                  has 965 have?</p>
              <p>And I'm NOT going to take 171 ever again if I can help it.
                  NEVER.</p>
              <p>In short, SMRT is a debacle. And 966 is just a reflection of
                  that compounded by traffic issues.</p>

              <p>That's right, but perception by the public only help to identify the problem, and does not give any solutions to it. 100 ppl rant about a svc, they may tell u its improved, but actually, how much of improvement does it really bring? </p>
              <p>I would also like to rant about my experiences with both sbst and smrt, 40 mins for 502 and faulty iris w/ ninja buses that do not appear. 30mins for 180 at bnl. But all this does not show the real problem within which i believe which is the lack of healthy competition.</p>
              <p>The problem is with smrt controlling nearly all public transportation options in certain areas of the island. To them, anyone leaving the area they will automatically get the business. There's no alternative at all. And since adding more bus trips from such areas will reduce their train pax, so they rather not do that which is probably why their services has been so lackluster.</p>
              <p>Those areas with smrt trains and sbst trunk services, you can see that ppl really consider taking the buses, because the services operated by sbst can be on par with the trains in terms of travel duration. But not the case in yishun, wdl, bb, cck, bpj yet.</p>
              <p>The solution, of course is the split up the rail and bus operations so that they give a <strong>real alternative</strong> to the commuters. Who would still take the trains if the bus services are just as good, and just as consistent. But this is up to the ptc and lta to act.</p>

              <p>And going back to a related topic, i think kmb's gBus makes more of a viable solution of a electric bus.</p>
              <p>It currently can go up to 5km (shld be able to be extended with more super capacitors) and charges in just 1 min. Although we dont have much routes with a distance of 5km, but this can see use in super short feeder routes like 806. Recharging can be done while layover at int since it takes only a minute.</p>

              <p>Well, i forgot to specify that its generally competition between rail and buses. A strong alternative to trains with buses will only do us good, and offload some demand on trains.</p>
              <p>I still dont see how smrt can do this without hurting their shareholders' interests however.</p>
              <p>But, if comparing smrt and sbst svcs that goes the same way, i would take smrt svcs too providing they come at about the same time. It just "feels" faster w/sl trying to go fast. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Actually I dunno why the new buses these days turn out to so chui after a few years.</p>
