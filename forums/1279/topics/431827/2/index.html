              <p>Same goes to MRT sv level like train door dwell time too tight etc.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chinese car giant BYD said SMRT has ordered 10 of its e-Bus electric vehicles while the first right-hand-drive units of its e6 battery-powered taxis will also be bound for the Singapore firm.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ms Nancy Mao, BYD's sales manager (overseas group), said the buses cost about US$650,000 (S$804,000) each - or about 70 per cent more than the average cost of a single-deck diesel-powered bus.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">The e6 is said to cost around US$40,000 each, or 20 per cent more than the equivalent taxi here.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ms Mao was speaking to delegates from the Land Transport Authority and Institution of Engineers Singapore, who visited the Chinese manufacturer's plant in Shenzhen earlier this week.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">It said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the firm - one of the world's biggest producers of electric and petrol-electric hybrids - to explore possibilities of establishing a joint venture to 'develop, distribute and sell electric vehicles' in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">SMRT's executive vice-president of commercial business and roads Teo Chew Hoon said: 'Exploring the use of electric vehicles in our fleet is one area which we are actively looking into. At this point in time, we are in the early stages of discussion with BYD.'</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Despite the higher initial purchase cost, electric buses and taxis are expected to offer operating savings.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Each public diesel bus consumes around $160 worth of fuel a day while electricity tariffs to charge each e-Bus are expected to be around $80 - a 50 per cent saving. Savings for taxis will be smaller, at between 20 and 30 per cent.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">BYD's Ms Mao said the company's first right-hand-drive electric buses - China is left-hand drive - will be rolled out from August.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">The first deliveries of the right-hand-drive e6 taxis will be made in June next year.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">BYD started in 1995 as a battery maker with 20 employees, serving mainly mobile-phone makers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">It now has 200,000 employees and is ranked as one of the biggest manufacturers of electric and hybrid vehicles, producing about half a million a year.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 12px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 11px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">It will deliver 200 e-Buses to the Shenzhen government next month and 600 by the end of the year.</span></p>

              <p>I doubt govt would ask SMRT to give up their bus ops consider their motto multi-modal transport company.Both SBST and SMRT got their rail and bus ops.The only best decision i can think is SMRT to handover Bukit Panjang,Choa Chu Kang,Bukit Batok and Kranji Depot to SBST.In return all Bt Merah Svc except svc 132 &amp; 153,Harbourfront svc except svc 80,195 from Marina Ctr,Buona Vista svc except svc 74 &amp; 185,Kent Ridge svc except 151 to SMRT.They can opt to take Ayer Rajah bus park or just built a depot near Pasir Panjang or Commonwealth there.At least majority of the bus svc there can use more rigids.</p>
              <p>So SBST from BBDEP control all Bt Batok svc except 852,Clementi and Ghim Moh as well as 160.Kranji bus park control CCK &amp; BPJ svc and 170.</p>
              <p>SMRT Ayer Rajah Depot can minor control svc like 167,851,65,93.RWS8 also near to the depot itself.</p>

              <p>If your friend living in Bukit Panjang rather drive to work than take a bus, that's not very unusual if he has a car.

              <p>The story would be different if he does not have a car, but cannot afford to buy one and drive it to work.

However they would really need to solve the congestion problem in public transport now.</p>
              <p>Also, what does 966 have to do with CBD? The most i have waited for 966 is 30mins at marine parade, but that's what you get for a service that runs on the expressway which is easily prone to jams which is <strong>ironically</strong> caused by people who rather drive to work than taking public transport.</p>
              <p>Instead of saying SBS and TIBS can do better, do you have any solutions in your mind to this problem? Why not make it a point to wake up earlier and take the premium services if you want to go to work on time and in comfort.</p>

              The solution is simple. Given all the Northwest services back to SBS and/or to another operator. Kick SMRTB out of the market.
              If the public transport system is that efficient in the area, then why would people still want to drive despite ERP and high parking charges? I believe congestion is not just the car problem but the relentless population boom here which makes transportation to another place more difficult because everyone wants to go everywhere in Singapore but yet because of this, the movement becomes clogged and slower because of the huge numbers of people trying to move one place to another at the same time, within the limited limits. If population is lower and better capacity infrastructures are being built, would Singaporeans be deprived of their own basic needs which have to be brainwashed by the government as kind of luxury? Who likes to crowd in a train everyday for their rest of their 50 years of working life after working 9 to 6 everyday? Like wise for HDB flats. If they can't keep up with the demand, then stop increasing the population and making profits out of HDB flats due to the situation of demand supress supply, and depriving the basic costs and purpose of a HDB flat.
               
              Lastly, running along expressways doesn't mean an excuse to provide poor services. Problem lies with the poor management of the bus operations. If it is said that jammed expressways always hinder bus operations, then why services like 36, 161, 168, 502, 518 and even 190, 857 still have better frequncies?
