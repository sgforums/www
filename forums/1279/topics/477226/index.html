              <p>I'm sorry, I was talking about the overall quality of China buses. I don't care if the bus is hybrid or not. And I'm talking about the China buses in overall should be better with long haul. Coz China buses perform better under high speed. Okay I buy your info, if it's hybrid then it shouldn't do long haul. </p>

              <p>You say that you were generalising, but you used "bus" which is singular.</p>
              <p>True. In English, for the same type of bus, "bus" could be plural. But you said "shit bus" and there are only 2 of them for reference's sake. How is this applicable to what you claim?</p>

              <p>True. In English, for the same type of bus, "bus" could be
              plural. But you said "shit bus" and there are only 2 of them for
              reference's sake. How is this applicable to what you claim?</p>

              <p>Bluff also must bluff more convincingly. </p>
              <p>That was nit-picking.</p>
              <p>The meat of my take is here:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You didnt give credit to those who
              at least tried to bring in something that <em>could be</em> a
              game-changer in the bus-fleet!</span></p>
              <p>All you do is call it "shit"!</p>
              <p>What is your problem?</p>
              <p>Of course you would be asking to be whacked.</p>
              <p>You talk about respect.</p>
              <p>Where is it for those who have been working hard FOR YOU in the

              <p>The reason I used "bus" is becoz I cannot ensure 8001 is still in SG, so I used it to refer to 8000 only.</p>
              <p>I mean, the trial has been a fail and it has been like a few years since SBST has brought it in. If not why is it lay-up for so long?</p>
              <p> Not to say the China buses are THAT bad, but is it suitable for the SG PT system? I doubt. </p>

              <p>Nobody said that SBST will expand the adoption of such buses.</p>
              <p>For more information, wait 10 years.</p>
              <p>Or *cough cough* ask insiders.</p>
              <p>You can do anything, just dont get caught right?</p>
              <p>WRONG.</p>
              <p>If you want to help, go sign the NDA and work with LTA, I am sure they will like to hear your opinions on these. </p>
              <p>If you need more convincing, think about the free public transport rides you get as a perk for working with LTA.</p>
              <p>Edit: What makes a trial successful btw? Did anybody here even stop to think? Was the trial in fact for SBST <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span>?</p>
              <p>When you answer these questions, maybe it will be that wee bit clearer.</p>
