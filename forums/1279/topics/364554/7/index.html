              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>I was a former bus driver.</p>
              <p>I used to have to drive fast, because I had no choice. I
              used to drive Service 174(some 14 years+ ago), and only
              have 105 minutes to travel from Boon Lay to New Bridge Road
              during peak hours.</p>
              <p>The traffic jam at Jalan Jurong Kechil between 8 to 9am was
              the worst. Then we had to drive up that steep slope which was
              beside Beauty World Centre. From Jalan Jurong Kechil to Dunean
              Road, usually took 20 minutes. I would have got only 50 minutes
              left, not forgetting the 2nd major jam at Farrer Road.</p>
              <p>If I don't speed, then I would be late and penalised.</p>
              <p>Heard that nowadays drivers won't be penalise for being late.
              How nice.</p>
              <p>Which service are you driving?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Not very long. Only 4 months because my Uni holidays had ended.</p>
              <p>The pay was ok, about $1250.00 not including OT.</p>
              <p>I was a standby crew for 3 services; 174, 190 and 66. I had driven Volvo B10M MK2, MK3, MK4 Euro 1, MB O405, Leyland Olympian DD, Volvo Olympian DD,</p>
              <p>I had a few boo boos. Once I drove the bus service 174 all the way from Boon Lay Interchange to Bukit Batok without updating the stages. Several passengers got fined by ticket inspector. But they all got their refunds back when the ticket inspector found it was my fault.</p>
              <p>There was an occasion when I was instructed to drive the bus (Leyland Olympian DD) to jrbp after finishing the last trip for 190. But I drove it to bbdep instead. The crew at jrbp couldn't find the bus the next day. By right, the crew at bbdep should have known that the bus was supposed to be in jrbp when they took out the ticketing console. But I was not the only one who made such mistakes, even experienced drivers too.</p>
              <p>There were several such incidents. Coincidentally, Leyland and MB were all sent to jrbp, while Volvos came to bbdep and arbp.</p>
              <p>I see that Volvo Olympian is also assigned to the jurong bus routes too.</p>
