I find that even without a concession, bus fares are very very cheap as opposed to Sydney and other parts of Australia.  In one day i can spend up to $25 AUD ($30 SGD) on bus fares alone (without a concession).  So consider yourselves very lucky that your transport has an integrated fare system, ad that it is subsidised by the government.<br></div>
