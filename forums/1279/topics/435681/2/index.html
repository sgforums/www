              <p>really, i don't know what's up wif those singapore LTA people. we should learn some things form hong kong. this is how they are different from us:</p>
              <p>1. HK tridents and B10TL are purchased earlier than s'pore did, but oredi have PIW feature. if SBS had taken the bother to purchase or change the tridents and B10TL wif PIW features, many svc would have became WAB svc long ago...</p>
              <p>2. HK determine WAB by STOPS, not SVC. As long as the bus is WAB and the stop is WAB- accessible, you can board ANY svc. that's why lke SMRT, they spread out all the WAB to different routes, batch by batch, so that there would be no one svc full WAB fleet while the other had zero WAB.</p>

              have became WAB svc long ago...</p>
              <p>2. HK determine WAB by STOPS, not SVC. As long as the bus is WAB
              and the stop is WAB- accessible, you can board ANY svc. that's why
              lke SMRT, they spread out all the WAB to different routes, batch by
              batch, so that there would be no one svc full WAB fleet while the
              other had zero WAB.</p>

              <p>pax won't know if the service they want to take has how many WAB buses that day. if they had to wait two hours for it PTOs are going to be arrowded. so at the initial stage of deployment this was not possible. now WAB declared services have a WAB maximum headway to ensure that their services are reliable for PIWs to wait. however i agree that SBST can get closer to this goal by declaring WAB quicker since a lot of services have received majority WAB fleet &amp; WAB fleet strength grows to 1,751 by end of this year.</p>

              <p>WAB isn't a requirement back then. Why spend more money on that??? I am more unhappy that they didn't buy more double deckers and expand the double decker fleet. Look at the overcrowdings now.</p>
              <p>SBST should really learn from Hong Kong to upgarade their fleet to 90% double deckers if the Singapore population is going to increase like these years. No point trying to predict and juggling the use of single deckers and double deckers because road conditions and crowd demand patterns are not always so predictable. And then overcrowding occurs in many single deckers and complains keep on throwing in. Full double decker fleet just can solve the problem.</p>

              <p>Ok la.</p>
              <p>I would give that SBST's current DD to SD still within arguably acceptable ratio. There are quite a number of services where better frequency would help much more than throwing in DDs.

              <p>SG can go with more double decks.</p>
              <p>In fact it helps to resolve manpower issues and seriously 12 mins freq and now you can have a little more direct buses plying the same road.</p>
              <p>6x 10 mins freq single decks deployed in 1 hr is still less than what 5x 11m ADDs can provide in terms of capacity. Granted.</p>
              <p>Then some buses can go w/ midis like 400, 403... No pt waste fuel and incurr cost on it when we hope more can be done on top of full day senior citizen concession. The poly concession issue has to be resolved.</p>
