The "alternatives" now provided are not like what the commuters expected, i.e. Reaching the same destination either by MRT or bus. The current "alternatives", seriously, is only more transfers, which means more revenue intake.<br><br>With the bus services gone (which can take passengers right to the door step of some places), taking MRT meant more money spent on transportation and more inconvenience (not only for regular commuters, how about senior citizens who can enjoy a ride to destination A, and how having to walk probably 5 to 10 mins or even more to the same destination?)<br><br>If more bus services are cut, I feel that the number of cars in Singapore will not reduce anytime soon, instead, rising like mercury.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends lah. Sv. 410 frequency is very horrible lately. SBST seem to be making the frequency of Sv. 53 and Sv. 56 longer, so more pax get on board and earn more per bus.</div>

Between 0656 to 0705 hr, one East bound train is equavilent to the arrival of 3 trains from the middle platform (from Woodlands). All the trains are packed like sardines. I hope SMRT would improve on that.<br><br>The frequency of sv 962 improved, but sv 859 has longer waiting time and one Bendy replaced by a 12m bus.</div>
