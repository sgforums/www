Sv. 74 frequency is very good already, its simply due to the adverse traffic conditions at Bt. Timah during peak hours. I once saw THREE Sv. 74 VO2X arriving together at HG going towards interchange, at 3pm during a holiday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Service 74 is fully aircon during the vacation (referring to the May - June and Nov - Dec period). During the Nov - Dec 03 period, I hardly see a NAC bus on the service.<br><br>This is because SBST does not have sufficient a/c buses (esp Superbuses) for service 74.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SBST 74 has very good frequency. At BV, one can see 1 or 2 Service 74 departs before Service 95 leave.<br><br>It could be just like TIBS 106, which I complaints of bad frequency. But other forumers think otherwise, and mentioned of adverse traffic conditions along Orchard Road.<br><br>So the above teaches us a very good lesson. When 2 or 3 or 4 or more of same services bumped into each other in a bus stop, shouldn't the one which has lagged, speed up, do not stop to pick up more passengers at each busstops (other when there are passengers alightings), till it had matched its schedule.<br><br>With such arrangement, passenger at downstream will not have to wait much longer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't get me wrong, I am just as frustrate when my bus does not turn up after 20 minutes.<br><br>However, my observation (last year) was that SBST74 indeed has pretty good frequency compare to many other services that ply along Commonwealth Ave West. Perhaps they had changed their schedule this semester.<br><br>Perhaps, they want you to travel by trains? And had cut down SBST 74 frequency.<br><br>At most only 2 TIBS 106 arrive at the same time at a bus stop, unlike SBST 74, it was not uncommon to have 3~4 to arrive at the same time. What does it show? SBST 74 has pretty high frequency.<br></div>
