This idea is not bad as this new extended service 45 doesn't really duplicate from AMK Ave 6 onwards to Upp East Coast. It provides a direct link from Yishun to AMK Ave 10. Provides a direct link from Yishun to Lor Ah Soo.<br>The only problem in my opinion is that it duplicates 851, 852 and 853 from AMK Ave 6 (Anderson Junior College) to Yishun which is about 7.5 stages.<br><br>2. By referring to The Street Directory by Mighty Minds, you need to travel Seletar Club Rd to link up to Yishun Ave 1. Besides, there is a gate between West Camp Rd and Seletar Club Rd at the northern junction of the circle roundabout. In addition, if 103/103W takes this route, it will skip Seletar Airport.<br>In my opinion, the major problem of idea No. 2 is the demand of the route. Judging from the timings and freq of 103W, the demand of commuters goign from Serangoon to Seletar Airport is not high in my opinion. Passengers going from Seletar Airport to Yishun can take 103W to Jalan Kayu and transfer to 858 or 39 instead.<br><br>From Yishun to Fernvale, 854 provides a direct link. 853 serves from Yishun to Serangoon Central. So, what is remaining is the YCK rd from Bowen to Serangoon Stadium.<br>As 103/103W is a SBST service, I don't think this service can go into Yishun Ave 4 or St 61 to serve Yishun residents. Thus, I feel that this idea is not really feastible to carry out.<br><br>3. I feel that this idea is gd as it provides a direct link from Yishun to AMK Ave 5 industrial areas, Hougang Ave 9 and Hougang Ctrl. The only problem which I think is the same as idea 1, duplication of 851, 852, 853 from Yishun to AMK Ave 6 Anderson Junior College. I feel that this idea 3 is better than idea 1 as it duplicates the least with SMRT Yishun trunk services. Demand for this service in my opinion will be rather healthy.<br><br>4. I dun think service 76 can be extended to Yishun as it will be too long for a loop service in terms of a trip from Yishun to Siglap Rd. The total fare stages for 76 then will be 49 + 15 = 64 stages. The extension of 135 to Yishun will heavily duplicate 853 if it is extended through AMK Ave 8, Ave 3, Ave 6 Lentor Ave and Yishun. Besides, 853 goes to Marine Parade in Sundays and Public Holidays using Amber Rd, Marine Parade Rd, Siglap Rd which 135 passes by them too.<br><br>Just a thought.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> On the whole, in my opinion, idea 3 is the best.</div>

I thought of that too, but Yishun roads are quite inflexible in the sense that firstly, Yishun Avenue 2 provides the most direct route to the central. Secondly, diverting to other routes might be sensitive as such diversions snatches the huge load away from SMRT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Turning left to YIS Ave 1 then to Sembawang Road, would compete with 169 and 171 for the load in the Military Campsites. Turning right to YIS Ave 1 then to St 81, Ave 4 or Ring Road would compete with the monopolies of SMRT Feeders (804, 806, 811, 812).<br><br>Then again, I heard that PTC is "opening up of feeder bus services in HDB towns for free competition." (http://www.ptc.gov.sg/services.asp). Maybe you're right in diverting some potential SBS routes.</div>
