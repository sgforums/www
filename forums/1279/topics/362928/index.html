              <p>I dunno but e interview seems funny and sometimes it's full of imagination.</p>
              <p>She says it's good for her co if everyone takes the MRT as it cuts down travelling time. But it would mean all the buses would be concentrated to feeder linkage to e MRT stations.</p>
              <p>She also said that the operators are looking at new bus routes that would improve their bottomline.Â so it's better when LTA takes over e planning</p>
              <p>At the same time, she mentioned that both transport operators have diff thinking onto operating their respective co.</p>

              <p>Then put trains with long-distance style seating, then charge double or even premium fares.</p>
              <p>If you really want imagination, then be prepared to invest into the system. Or better still, ask LTA to foot the bill for the new bypass tracks!</p>

              <p>Not everyone wants to be like squeezed sardines in a tin can. And sorry by looking at the Japanese rail sysyem, I feel it is really pathetic that everyone has to be pushed to be squeezed into the carrige, really no life. And being an inflexible and fixed kind of transport mode, in situations of overpopulation and power failure and not to mention unexpected stews of incidents that can happen anytime to disrupt rail services, rail system is not the long term solution for all transport problems.</p>
              <p>If one thinks that everyone likes to take rail, I think that it is a very simple minded and naive approach. For people who hate to take MRT, it is either buses for them else they will rather use their own transport. I am one of the example. I prefer personal comfort and flexibility rather than just rush your way without even know what is life. If one can argue buses are slower, why not take the own initiaive to plan your route ahead instead??? Plan early and be early. And being an overpopulated and going to be more populated nation in future, rail systems is not a solution to anything. And building one is not cheap and can't be done everywhere since many parts of the country is made up of soft soil composites and above ground structures gets heavier and heavier as the population grows. Operating is not cheap either.</p>
              <p>Well, for someone who have notÂ been squeezed like a sardine inÂ a tin can before, no wonder such people can haveÂ build such kinds of castles in the air.Â </p>
              <p>Just hope that one dayÂ one of theÂ MRT tunnel collaspes because of overpopulated structures above, then we would see what kind of chaos we have when the public transport system is just solely relying on one mode.</p>
              <p>For a company that doesn't know its customers needs but only know how to benefit itself, no wonder it is always in the red.</p>

              <p>Want to cut down travelling time? Want to earn more money?</p>
              <p>Simple. Introduce Japan-style limited stopping service :</p>
              <p>Semi : Boon Lay -&gt; Jurong East -&gt; Buona Vista -&gt; Outram Park all stops until Bugis -&gt; Paya Lebar -&gt; Tanah Merah -&gt; [Tampines -&gt; Pasir Ris] OR [Changi Airport]</p>
              <p>Express : Boon Lay -&gt; Interchange Stations Only + Tanjong Pagar -&gt; Pasir Ris</p>
              <p>Morning Express : Ang Mo Kio -&gt; Yishun -&gt; Woodlands -&gt; Choa Chu Kang -&gt; Jurong East -&gt; Same as Above</p>
              <p>Then put trains with long-distance style seating, then charge double or even premium fares.</p>
              <p>If you really want imagination, then be prepared to invest into the system. Or better still, ask LTA to foot the bill for the new bypass tracks!</p>

              <p>Tunnel collapse is a bit far-fetched, but they better jolly well make sure maintenance is done properly - In the UK, either trains <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/livetravelnews/realtime/by-date.aspx?offset=weekend">don't run during weekends</a> or they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayrigg_derailment">jump track killing people</a> because the tracks got broken after years of negelect.</p>
              <p>Regardless of what the CEO thinks, at end of the day people will hold the government responsible simply because SMRT is a GLC.</p>
