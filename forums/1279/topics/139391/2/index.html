The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is installing a new S$135 million Automated People Mover System to make transfers between the three terminals convenient and seamless.<br><br>The new Automated People Mover System will comprise of ten train services linking the three terminals through 6.5 kilometres of elevated train tracks. The new system will have a total of seven train stations: two stations in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 respectively and three stations in Terminal 3.<br><br>The new trains will come equipped with LCD screens in the cabins, giving flight information and other airport information. The cabins will also have more vertical stanchions and handholds, as well as designated areas for baggage trolleys, enhancing the convenience of users. There will also be plasma TV displays at the train stations to inform passengers of the arrival time of the next train.<br><br>"The new Automated People Mover System will provide users of Changi Airport with seamless connection to all Terminals, including the future of Terminal 3. The development of this new Automated People Mover System, an indispensable system to any major airport today, will most certainly be a challenging project to CAAS and our partner, Mitsubishi Consortium," said Mr Wong Woon Liong, Director-General CAAS.<br><br>Mitsubishi Consortium, comprising of Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, has been appointed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to supply the new Automated People Mover System at Changi Airport.<br><br>Work on the new Automated People Mover System will begin in December 2002 and is expected to be completed in 2006. Terminal 3 will have a handling capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, bringing the total handling capacity of Changi Airport to 64 million passengers per year.<br><br></blockquote>will this system replaced the skytrain?</div>
