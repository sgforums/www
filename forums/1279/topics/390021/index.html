              <p><br>LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- The logistics service provider Logwin is now strategically even better positioned in Dubai. Logwin has opened a new additional office in the Dubai Airport Free Zone Authority (DAFZA). The office is situated in the immediate vicinity of the airlines and is the company's second location in Dubai. The staff began operations on 20 January 2010, managed by Satish Kumar. The focus is the processing of air freight. <br><br>(Photo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/02/03/20100203472978.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/sa/2010/02/03/20100203472978.html</span></span></a> ) <br>(Logo: <a href="http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200805161604.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.prnasia.com/xprn/sa/200805161604.jpg</span></span></a> ) <br><br>In order to further improve the service for customers in Dubai, Logwin is not just employing experienced staff from its first location in the Al Musalla Tower at its new DAFZA office, but has taken on new staff, in particular in the area of sales. A total of 13 staff in the new office takes care of customers. "Opening the second office makes sense in order to further expedite the processing of global air freight transport while retaining the same high level of quality," says Hauke Mueller, Managing Director Region Europe Middle East at the Logwin business segment Air + Ocean. "This will allow us to significantly increase the number of processed shipments and improve our service to customers." <br><br>Around 300 companies currently have their main office in the DAFZA. Most of them are global players maintaining business connections around the world. Logwin customers from the technology and luxury goods industry as well as from the automotive sector are also based here. "Customer proximity is not just another phrase for us - it is something we practice," explains Hauke Mueller. "In Dubai, we have bucked the trend and succeeded in growing. With the new office we have created the conditions for continuing on this successful course." <br><br>Logwin airport address in Dubai: <br><br>Logwin Air &amp; Ocean Middle East LLC <br>LIU - I 08 <br>P.O.Box 119796 <br>Dubai Airport Free Zone <br>United Arab Emirates <br><br>Phone: +971 4-299 3555 <br>Fax: +971 4-299 3666 <br>Email: satish.kumar@logwin-logistics.com <br><br>Logwin headquarters address in Dubai: <br><br>Logwin Air &amp; Ocean Middle East LLC <br>P.O.Box 119796 <br>901, Al Musalla Tower <br>Khalid Bin Al Waleed Road <br>Dubai, United Arab Emirates <br><br>Phone: +971 4-397 9333 <br>Fax: +971 4-397 8822 <br>Email: sumesh.nair@logwin-logistics.com <br><br>About Logwin AG <br><br>As an external partner, Logwin AG, Grevenmacher (Luxembourg), develops a comprehensive range of logistics and service solutions for trade and industry.
