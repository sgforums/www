              <p>SBS 0334 M was coming out from the PIE at Jln Anak Bukit. Instead of turning left into Jln Anak Bukit, it turned right at Jln Anak Bukit and continued onto Upp Bt Timah Rd. I decided to help the driver once again by asking him to u-turn just before the Upp Jurong Rd junction and resume normal route from there. It was a super tight u-turn but the bus managed to go thru :)</p>

              SMRT bus drivers are mostly Malaysians and are not familiar with Singapore's roads.....
              
              I met twice.....
              
              One was on 171 when the female driver missed the Bukit Panjang exit while travelling towards Marina Centre, and she stopped in the middle of the expressway, almost attempting to reverse in the 80km expressway route to go back to the exit..... and den she decided to stop on the expressway, hoping that some angel would come and guide her back to the road.. thankfully got somebody guide her back using Dairy Farm exit, and she ended up skipping two bus stops!
              
              One was on 700A and it was on Christmas Day 2007 when the route was diverted. The uncle did not know how to drive back to Orchard from Havelock Road and drove all the way to Great World City and Tiong Bahru..... when he was approaching Tiong Bahru, he begun to fumble and drove very slowly. And he hit the curb of the road twice and the bus almost turn over....  Den he was waiting at the bus stop where there's 75 and 970, hoping that his colleague could guide him back. Worst thing was his colleague oso didnt noe and drove off. End up 2 passengers guide the driver back..... to Orchard and we took 20 mins extra to city.

              <p>BC driving 243G with correct 243G destos arrives at 243W boarding point. The passengers board without knowing. BC himself also dunno he arrive at wrong berth. After all the passengers boarded, then another BC pointed out to him he in the wrong berth!</p>
              <p>So he no choice but to drive 243W route instead. Then immediately, another 243W bus came, while 243G route long queue because no bus! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If the other BC hadn't pointed out to him, he would have taken the 243G route instead with 243W passengers!</p>

              <p>Have anyone experinced Night riders driving the wrong way instead?</p>
              <p>I once took NR1 back home from town.<br>(The driver was an indian and he really looked like those construction worker instead of a bus driver) Instead of turning left to Yishun Ave 2, the bus-stop infront of block 220, it travelled straight to Yishun Ring Road and dropped me opposite the columbarium and along the then renovating Peixin Primary School at 5 am.</p>
              <p>-______________________________________=.</p>
              <p>It was not an accidental incident to me because when he was suppose to change lane from the middle to the left, he done it slowly thus causing the taxi speeding towards that supposingly empty space that the NR1 was supposed to be at. Therefore, the driver had to drop me at that stop leaving me blurred as I alighted from the bus thinking that I saw the stops wrongly. </p>
