            <div class='col-md body'>okay guys, about my experience on service 9, i took it a long time ago. probably, in feb or mar. i believe that the software is more stable now. if u remember clearly, there were a lot of complains about the farestage-updating on service 9 in the straits times forum and the public questioned how farestage-updating is done for loop services. so, i guess the situation is well taken care of now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

With the reported 4.1 million transactions a day, a 99.9 per cent reliability rate still means that 4,100 transactions are incorrectly processed each day. I can only assume this means wrong deductions. That is equivalent to almost 1.5 million erroneous deductions a year, which is a lot of money.<br><br>I would also like to ask the LTA if the statistics on 'cases of wrong deductions' were taken from registered reports of such cases, that is, commuters filing a claim for a refund.<br><br>If so, I think it is grossly inaccurate because I am sure there are many, if not more, cases that are not reported.<br><br>If, however, the 'cases of wrong deductions' cited indeed came straight from the source system, I would like to ask the LTA what it would take for it to initiate an automatic refund to the affected stored-value cards. After all, at a very impressive failure rate of 0.006 per cent, we are dealing with only 250 transactions a day.<br><br>This is the responsible thing to do, and would mean a lot to commuters in the lower-income group, where every cent counts.<br><br>Joseph Wong Yong Lye<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by crazy monkey:<br>Ez-link: 4,100 incorrect transactions remain<br><br>IT IS indeed heartening to learn from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) that the ez-link system achieves a 99.9 per cent reliability rate and that 'cases of wrong deductions' have decreased from 0.27 per cent to just 0.006 per cent year on year ('Ez-link system highly reliable'; ST, Sept 24).<br><br>However, beyond these statistics, there are still some hard numbers to grapple with. With the reported 4.1 million transactions a day, a 99.9 per cent reliability rate still means that 4,100 transactions are incorrectly processed each day. I can only assume this means wrong deductions. That is equivalent to almost 1.5 million erroneous deductions a year, which is a lot of money.<br><br>I would also like to ask the LTA if the statistics on 'cases of wrong deductions' were taken from registered reports of such cases, that is, commuters filing a claim for a refund.<br><br>If so, I think it is grossly inaccurate because I am sure there are many, if not more, cases that are not reported.<br><br>If, however, the 'cases of wrong deductions' cited indeed came straight from the source system, I would like to ask the LTA what it would take for it to initiate an automatic refund to the affected stored-value cards. After all, at a very impressive failure rate of 0.006 per cent, we are dealing with only 250 transactions a day.<br><br>This is the responsible thing to do, and would mean a lot to commuters in the lower-income group, where every cent counts.<br><br>Joseph Wong Yong Lye<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>They still dun understand tat NOTHING IS PERFECT....yes 4100 is alot but 99.9% is oso alot....imagine how many commuters a day...human make mistakes....machines do too....the system have improved so much but ppl are still not quite statified...it is oso a responsibility for a commuter to check the card balance upon alighting to see if any error is made...if undercharged , good for him...if overcharged...very simple...go to any transitlink office!There are plenty...and can be acess after school or work...yes ppl say they still nid to pay the bus fare to get there...but if its on the way...i dun c a point of complaning....im sure u pass by a MRT station(most of them have transitlink office) or a bus interchange at least once in 3 days...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if fare cheats gets jail terms and fines, then commuters who are overcharged etc should be compensated for the trouble they go through if they are claiming the difference back eg. telephone fees and at least, 20 times the fare difference refunded.<br><br>taken from example of customs fining contraband goods 20 times entering SG..<br><br>apparently ez-link isnt a fine gentleman..<br><br>and yes, as said, i rather they use the farecard instead of wasting hundreds of millions on a software which is vulnerable to countless errors, and can potentially cripple the bus/mrt should a total breakdown on the system occurs one day..<br><br>a side note: with farecards, bus companies claimed they lost $10 million/year due to farecard cheats<br><br>with ez-link, they lost $9 million/year.. like tt with $400 million invested, they wont recoup the losses that fast</div>
