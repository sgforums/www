Svc 10 &amp; 196 also run parallel from Nicoll Hwy to Keppel Rd. Extending 10 to Jurong East may boost ridership, but the route may be too long.</div></blockquote>Do note that sv10 wic runs from Tampines to Kent Ridge via Shenton Way is the ONLY PUBLIC TPT from Upp East Coast/East Coast Area to Shenton Way.<br>sv196 duplicates part of sv10 only from Mountbatten Rd[near School for the Deaf]other than tt, it takes over the portion from Mountbatten Rd[Tanjong Katong Rd junction] to provide a FAST link to town via Nicoll Highway &amp; sv196 DOES NOT STOP along Keppel Rd! If u do take sv10 in the am, a BIG CROWD boards sv 10 at Kallang Airport area, tts y DDs are needed. Also note tt sv10 serves quite a number of schools along the route like Broadrick, TKGS,St Patrick's... so need not extend sv10 to Boon Lay or where so ever! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
