              <p><br>Agree on that. That time I witnessed a Jap family boarding 9190B on 133 and they had no coins, just a $10 note. BC asked father to go change coins... so paiseh for the man especially when he had to ask elderly for coins. Too bad I was at the interchange waiting for another bus, else I'd have helped him.</p>
              <p>P.S.: I knew he was Jap because he was talking to an old lady beside him when they were both waiting for 133. =D</p>

              <p><br>Actually, many many years before 1995, there were coin changing machines at every bus interchange. They were introduced in the mid 80s when all the bus services become One-Man-Operated and paying the exact fare was required. The machines were red and they were about the size of a vending machine. You put your note at the top and KA-CHING!, the loose coins will fall into a metal bowl below. Initially it accepted $1 or $5 notes. Later, $2 notes were also accepted and a slot was also added for $1 coins. With the introduction of the magnetic farecard in the 1990s, most people don't need to change coins anymore and the machines fade away.</p>

              <p>i saw in recent newspaper articles that the authorities are trying to implement a common cashcard that can be used for transport fares, food,  ERP, convenience stores, etc etc.</p>
              <p>By then, the STB, travel agencies, airports, checkpoints etc can publicise widely of this cashcard to create awareness for tourists and visitors. Top-up facilities should be made accessible islandwide. Bt then, money change machine would become redundant.</p>
