              <p>Hi drymilo, <br> Okay, I apologize for the misunderstood use of the word 'senseless' as 
              it is only 'senseless' in the context of better improvements to public 
              transport such as bus lanes, improve frequencies and better bicycling 
              experiences as means to lessen the national dependence on private car 
              and taxi modes of transport since these are understood to not only be 
              more dangerous and pollutive, but also more road space occupying- thus 
              reducing the efficiency to which road space and energy resources are 
              each being used.<br> <br> And as <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/give-way-buses-scheme%3D-senseless-draconian-public-policy-3948891.html#post70965614">anddrool had correctly mentioned (25-10-2012, 02:38 PM)</a> <em>"Its a chicken and egg problem. A cycle that is hard to crack."<br> </em><br> Isn't the current delay in bus trip durations due to congestion by cars 
              on roads an obvious consequence of an unsatisfactory public transport 
              system and by how much does giving buses some <strong>slight </strong>preference 
              in exiting bus bays against moving main road traffic (against the more 
              established major-minor road right of way rules) make adequate 
              improvements to the public transport experience? <br> <br> Aren't bus lanes, increased bus frequencies, better planned bus routes, 
              bus lanes where necessary and the use of bicycles for short journeys the
               optimal use of road thoroughfares in overpopulated Singapore? Why 
              should rude and angry car drivers continue to frighten off cyclists from
               roads in Singapore?<br> <br> In short, the 'give way to buses scheme' is only cosmetic improvement to
               the current public transport service standard in Singapore- perhaps 
              part of the Singapore government's excessive pandering to private car 
              owners who like to show off their gleaming new vehicles to the world to 
              see- but at a consequence of an increasing high local environmental 
              footprint and a stressed up and toxic and unhealthy society.<br> <br> The government of the day does not have the gumption to improve public 
              transportation and chooses only (inherently dangerous) cosmetic, lip 
              service improvements to the current public road transport scheme.<br> <br> Singaporeans are getting stressed by the day, either by inefficient and 
              sidelined public transport improvements and the lost freedom to cycle 
              short distances to save money and improve their health.<br> <br> The Prime Minister of Singapore has already admitted to his incompetence at regulating banks in Singapore, saying <em>"financial
               markets have variegated into all kinds of sophisticated activities, 
              products, derivatives, investment activities, trading - and the 
              (commercial banks) are also in these... It's very hard to draw a line"</em>; and continues to say: "<em>... if all the </em>banks
               threaten to die at the same time, governments cannot help but go and 
              rescue them" (as they did in 2008 and 2009)" [source: <strong>'Regulating tightly 'not always feasible''</strong>; <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.sg/content/pmosite/mediacentre/inthenews/primeminister/2012/October/regulating_tightlynotalwaysfeasible.html">ST,08Oct2012</a>, (<a href="http://www.sammyboy.com/showthread.php?131351-Bank-failure-in-Singapore-is-PM-Lee-is-sleeping-with-the-enemy&amp;p=1251663#post1251663">alt link</a>)].<br> <br> Evidently, the Prime Minister of Singapore is indeed, quite incompetent 
              about the regulation of banks in Singapore and if one reads the said 
              report correctly, places the reserves of Singapore at the feet of 
              bankers (in the form of bailouts as America did in 2008 and 2009), with 
              the simple excuse that<em> "that mishaps were in the nature of the capitalist system"</em>. [PS: The US govt borrowed/ printed <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Total_Wall_Street_Bailout_Cost">USD4.76Trillion (high water mark at USD13.87Trillion)</a> to bail out banks and companies affected by the Lehman crisis of 2008-9 ]<br> <br> Singapore, like the USA,  is an ultra capitalistic country and in my 
              mind, the Prime Minister too cannot prioritize the importance of cycling
               and public transportation over the growth of the private car 
              population; and ostensibly, neither is the safety of cyclist on 
              Singapore roads much of his concern.<br> <br> Singapore might have achieved first world status in terms of GDP, but in
               terms of having first class cycling and public road transport system 
              befitting a first world society, Singapore is nothing but a pipe dream 
              of recurrent mistakes.<br> <br> Reference(s):<br> - <strong>'I gave way to bus -- and got rammed from behind'</strong>- <em>"STOMPer

              always have multi-lanes everywhere, so somehow u gotta give way when the
               situation arise. it is still so in smaller lanes/avenues in a good 
              number of HDB estates. as u can see from <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pIxjBrW-NwQ/UId_KuytPzI/AAAAAAAAAnA/J1sPXDsD2kU/s1600/Give+Way+to+Bus+scheme+enforcement.jpg">the pic u posted in the 1st post</a>. <br> - so taking the whole issue out of context is not gonna prove ur point. 
              some places, esp built up places, couldnt have more road widening. u are
               not gonna tear down whole blocks of flats or shops are u? <br> - and all these got nothing to do with bikes. bikes are even less 
              efficient than buses. and like i said in the past, dun use angmohs for 
              examples. americans 8 cars/10 persons, all of EU and japan, 6 cars/10 
              persons. singapore, 1 car/10 persons. then they come and tell u about 
              greenie theories and environmental problems. lol, farking hypocrite i 
              say, and pretty dumb for ppl to buy that. go tell the angmohs to cut 
              down on car ownership and not us. </blockquote></div>
              <p>Hi ponpokku, nope, I've no objection to giving way, in fact I 
              often do, by sometimes traveling at or under the speed limit of the road
               along the left most lane and slowing down to let buses exit should they
               wish to (its safer to drive slower, and you can conduct conversations 
              (w passengers) whilst you do)(80kmh@ expressway is most fuel saving).<br> <br> The context of this argument is that transport, road use and citizen's 
              lives would be improved if the government were to favor cycling and 
              public transport use over the use of private cars.<br> <br> <strong>In the beginning</strong>, when traffic was negligible/ light, bus bays 
              never had to exist, since buses would just stop anywhere by the side of 
              the road and then move on; any other vehicles following would either 
              stop altogether, or else overtake by filtering into the opposite lane 
              (provided no oncoming traffic was seen).<br> <br> But times have moved on, bus frequencies have increased, as have their 
              loads and so has the population of private cars- exploded.<br> <br> Road widening would keep up with the traffic flow but as you have 
              mentioned, this is drastic suggestion would not be ideal in the light of
               high rise buildings recently built.<br> <br> You are however very wrong where the use of bikes concerned. Absent the 
              danger of riding bicycles on Singapore roads, cycling certainly provides
               an overall better commuter experience. According to the study <strong>'Relationship between physical activity and general mental health'</strong> [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743512003945">Preventive Medicine, 07Sept2012</a>]: <em>"The optimal threshold volume for mental health benefits was of<strong> 2.5 to  7.5 hours of weekly <span style="color: red;">physical activity</span></strong>.
               .... Individuals who engaged in the optimal  amount of physical 
              activity were more likely to have reported better mental health"</em>.<br> According to '<strong>Public transport in Singapore: Ride bicycle is faster</strong>' [<a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/current-affairs-lounge-17/public-transport-singapore-ride-bicycle-faster-3572846.html">HWZ,18Jan2012</a>][<a href="http://www.sammyboy.com/showthread.php?108536-Public-transport-in-Singapore-Ride-bicycle-is-faster">alt site</a>]:<em> "bus speeds have gone down from 19.1kmh in 2007 to 17.8kmh (latest)... 
              ... a 'more experienced' cyclist can maintain an average speed of <strong><span style="color: red;">25kph</span></strong> over a 'short-medium distance of 20-30miles' (32 - 48km)"</em>.<br> Given that on average, <strong>cycling is ~40% faster than taking a bus in Singapore</strong> [25kmh(cycle) vs 17.8kmh(bus)] (for the 'more experienced cyclist'), 
              and the fact that by virtue of it contributing excellently towards the 
              attainment of <em>"2.5 to  7.5 h of weekly physical activity"</em>- an so reducing the <a href="http://ifonlysingaporeans.blogspot.sg/2011/11/1-in-10-will-suffer-from-mental-illness.html">rates of mental illness prevalent in Singapore</a>, besides being 'environmentally friendly' I find it hard to understand how you may logically suggest that <em>"bikes are even less efficient than buses"</em>.<br> <br> According to <strong>'List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density'</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density">Wikipedia</a>], Singapore's population density is 7,363/sqkm, USA: 34/sqkm, Japan: 338/sqkm. Using your figures of <em>"americans 8 cars/10 persons, all of EU and japan, 6 cars/10 persons. singapore, 1 car/10 persons"</em>,
               the density of cars per sqkm in SG, USA, Japan would be in the ratios 
              of 736.3: 27.2: 202.8, of which one can easily see that the density of 
              cars in Singapore is at least 3 times its nearest rival- in a land where
               space is a scarcity, the use of private bicycles and public 
              transportation MUST be given significant priority.<br> <br> The best way for one bus to exit a bus bay during peak hours is the 
              obstruction to on coming traffic caused by the presence of another 
              seeking to enter the same bay; the best way to reduce motorcar traffic 
              on roads is to make cycling and bus rides an effective and efficient way
               to get around.<br> <strong><br> In the light of </strong>better planned bus routes, more frequent bus 
              services, the freedom to cycle, travel free, keep fit and improve the 
              overal state of health of the community, mental or otherwise; the 
              effectiveness and ease of enforcing restricted hour bus lane rules, the 
              'give way to buses scheme' (GWTBS) is a mere slip shod, lip-service 
              creation of a government which has lost its moral compass to govern; and
               in time, will soon lose its popular mandate too.<br> <br> Reference(s):<br> - <strong>'I gave way to bus -- and got rammed from behind'</strong>- <em>"STOMPer
