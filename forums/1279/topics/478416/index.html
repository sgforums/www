              <p>169 got weekday bendies... It's just that the bendies are all splits, so none or just one pathetic bendy would appear on 169 on weekends...</p>
              <p>972 just needs more buses, maybe 2-3 splits? Then, they can make use of <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">SMB3092A</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">SMB3093Y</span></strong>, which just jump around on 972 and other random services...</p>

              <p>There is a rationale behind it. 160, 170, 170X are all SD fleet and SMRT has that in abundance with the new MAN A22s. This can be traded for routes like 190, 854, 169 that really need high capacity buses and are not given to them because they don't have them.</p>

              <p>ONE svc also so jialat. How to entrust the cross-border industry to them?</p>
              <p>And your practical situations really proved very dangerous. What are you actually thinking? This cross-border thing is a matter of the PTO, and perhaps the nation's PT's reputation. In fact, it should be the OTHER way round. If you can't monitor and fair resources to the local svcs then have fun doing those out of Singapore. And I see the two svcs as equal levels, no this priority here this priority there. Besides, 170 plies the city too what, so doesn't that cross your statement?</p>
              <p>So shouldn't we give something lighter to start with? For eg 66? What I can tell you is SBST management for 66 is catastrophic, so maybe that pose has a less risky target for SMRT?</p>

              <p>Well do you think SMRT will care?</p>
              <p>Just look at 950. Just look. </p>
              <p>ONE svc also so jialat. How to entrust the cross-border industry
              to them?</p>
              <p>And your practical situations really proved very dangerous. What
              are you actually thinking? This cross-border thing is a matter of
              the PTO, and perhaps the nation's PT's reputation. In fact, it
              should be the OTHER way round. If you can't monitor and fair
              resources to the local svcs then have fun doing those out of
              Singapore. And I see the two svcs as equal levels, no this priority
              here this priority there. Besides, 170 plies the city too what, so
              doesn't that cross your statement?</p>
              <p>So shouldn't we give something lighter to start with? For eg 66?
              What I can tell you is SBST management for 66 is catastrophic, so
              maybe that pose has a less risky target for SMRT?</p>

              <p>Just look at 190. Do you care more about 190 or a cross border service? Which service by SMRT is exemplary? </p>
              <p>Also why is 66 catastrophic? Do you even know what that means?</p>
