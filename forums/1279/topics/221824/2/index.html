I was on a service 69 bus (Is it SBS 0594D or SBS 0851L?) heading to Bedok Bus Interchange. The auntie driver so slow that even SBS 0776X on service 18 overtook the bus and I almost could not catch my 225 bus on time!<br><br>But SBST states that BC's have to be on schedule.

"Warp Factor 9 fully engaged, prepare for maximum speed," the synthesized voice on the dashboard replied. "Shift bus to rightmost lane, boost to maximum speed," ordered Captain Kok. The bus then cut through four lanes, completely ignoring oncoming traffic that it managed to somehow avoid, and move into the rightmost lane, which was specially reserved for vehicles that have minimum speeds of 1238 KM/H*. "Bus fully in rightmost lane, maximum speed mode OK and ready for power input, all other systems OK," came the reply from the dashboard. "Full speed ahead!", yelled Captain Kok. The bus' engine emitted one last whine and it glowed a brilliant bright blue, and it shot off with a blasting sound at warp speeds along the expressway, engine glowing brightly, like a laser beam. All this while, the bus' passengers were looking on with awe - they never thought a bus could have hyperdrive technology installed. Within 10 seconds, the bus approached within 100 metres of it's intended exited. "Disengage hyperdrive, switch to Normal Drive," order the Captain. "Disengaging hyperdrive, engaging hyperdrive stop operation. Force field engaged to shield against G-forces." The bus then slowed down drastically and almost instantly, and the engine died down with a quick high-low pitch whine, the energy pods' and the engine's glow dying out. As that happened, a force field tried to shield the passengers from the G-forces, but a few still vomited their guts out right at that moment, unable to withstand the forces acting upon their body. "Normal Drive engaged," the dashboard announced. "Move bus to leftmost lane, prepare to exit expressway at exit 15** and switch to normal road operating mode," Captain Kok ordered. The bus then cut through three lanes towards the exit, somehow avoiding the oncoming traffic again. "Bus fully in leftmost lane, moving bus onto exit ramp. Normal road operating mode engaged. Passenger requested stop at next calling bus stop." the dashboard replied. Then, "Engines risk overheating from hyperdrive usage, please engage coolant system. " "Do it," was the reply from Captain Kok. The bus then slowed down further, as the coolant ran through the engines and energy pods, bringing the almost-literally burning engines to normal operating temperatures. The bus then drove off the exit ramp and continued along it's route normally."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yes, I watch too much science fiction  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .<br><br>*1238 KM/H is the speed of sound at sea level under normal conditions.<br>**Exit 15 on the CTE is where route 857 buses exit to Yio Chu Kang Road from the CTE when going to Yishun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>NOTICE!
