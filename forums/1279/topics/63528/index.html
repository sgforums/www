            <div class='col-md body'>Svc 107 did ply Upp Serangoon Rd, but i can explain why you don't seem to recall as so.<br><br>Before 1986 (and probably also 1987 but not 1988 ) motorists along Upp Serangoon Rd can only travel to Serangoon Gardens and Serangoon North via Braddell Rd and Lor Chuan, or via Yio Chu Kang Rd. This is because the current Serangoon Central area was not developed yet. In other words, Upp Serangoon Rd then still existed as it is now, spanning all the way to Punggol Rd, but there just wasn't Serangoon Ave 3, Serangoon Central and Boundary Rd to connect to Serangoon Gardens and Serangoon North from upp Serangoon Rd like we do now. So they have to use Braddell Rd or Yio Chu Kang Rd.<br><br>Svc 107 (and also Svcs 101 and 106) plied via Lor Chuan and Braddell Rd on its way from Serangoon Gardens to Upp Serangoon Rd and vice versa. Thus, the actual sector of Upp Serangoon Rd plied is only between Braddell Rd and MacPherson Rd/PIE, and then, i believe, was only cemeteries, a hospital (Youngberg Memorial Hospital), a few factories (Singapore National Printers etc) and a private estate. So, you may not have remembered as clearly, since there isn't a prominent landmark there.<br><br>Regarding Svc 156, i could not tell you the actual route as i do not have the info now. However, if u r interested, try visiting National Reference Library Singapore Resource Centre section at Central Library Level 3 and get a Bus Guide that is between 1979-83. It is at the very last shelf, call number is 388.3221.<br><br>As for Svc 136, the old route from Ang Mo Kio up to Upp Serangoon Rd (End) is unchanged since its introduction in the 1970s. It is probable the route of Svc 156 duplicates that of Svc 136. But the bus system then is different from now. Then, SBS tries to provide direct links whenever possible between places to make it fast, cheap and convenient, thus duplication is common. Now the MRT forms the backbone of the Singapore Public Transport system, and thus new ideas of transferring instead of direct links is introduced and duplication is now a taboo.<br><br>SERVICE 107 (Serangoon Gardens - Shenton Way (Loop)):<br>[1985] Serangoon Gardens Terminal, (Serangoon Gardens Way), Lor Chuan, Boundary Rd, Lor Chuan, Braddell Rd, (Upp Serangoon Rd, Bendemeer Rd, Lavender St, Crawford St), Beach Rd, Connaught Dr, Collyer Quay, Raffles Quay, Shenton Way, (Keppel Rd), Anson Rd, Robinson Rd, (Collyer Quay, Fullerton Rd), Empress Place, (St. Andrew's Rd), Beach Rd, Jln Sultan, (Victoria St, Lavender St, Serangoon Rd, Upp Serangoon Rd), Braddell Rd, Lor Chuan, Boundary Rd, Lor Chuan, (Serangoon Gardens Way) and Serangoon Gardens Terminal.<br>NOTE: () denotes non-stop sector.</div>

This is where buses which come out from Buona Vista Terminal pick up their passengers today. Ever noticed that its bus bay is extra long? Its due to the fact that it was once a terminus! So buses which ended at C'wealth Ave were not exactly extended to Buona Vista Terminal.<br><br>I realised there were a lack of proper terminals back then. Most services just end at the roadside.

            <div class='col-md body'>judging that Kallang Rd started at the bridge of Rochor River could it be part of current Crawford Lane? or on the land now occupied by SIR? i have no answers yet (there seems to be less street directories than bus guides in NRL..) but jus to set u n myself thinking.. n also thus it might not be somewhere around old Kallang Gas Works if the above is true..</div>
