            <div class='col-md body'>Wireless surfing is not exactly practical. Most of the time one would not have any time to do much surfing before the bus arrives. Yes, it is useful as a way to kill time, but 'killing time' is not reason enough to spend money on wireless systems. Leave this implementation to the restaurants and airports instead.<br><br>The other suggestion of snack stalls and newstands are feasible, although they apply more to bus-stops in busier areas.<br><br>For less busy areas, one of the things I think might be useful would be that fans be installed in the stops. Temperatures are high most of the time, and not to mention rising temperatures in the passengers who have waited for the past half-an-hour.<br><br>Comfortable seats, as someone else suggested, is something useful, too. The upgrading of the bus-stops some time ago did nothing to make seats more comfortable. Some bus-stops have metallic seats, and others even have those bench-like seats with no back-support (the metallic ones, at least, have the ad-boards as support). If I am not mistaken, the taller of the two metal seats has its bench tilted slightly, and if not for the grooves, people would have slided down, or have much pressure applied to their legs to prevent it.<br><br>And how about better rain-shelter? I know it isn't possible to block out rain completely, given that rain can be sprayed at an angle, but some bus-stops i have encountered even have rain water dripping through gaps in the joints between the covered walkway and the bus-stop. The drains that bridge the gaps between the roofs of the shelter and walkway don't seem to work all the time, even...<br><br>Just my views. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>WJTW<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A bus stop should display bus service info which is sadly lacking in Singapore, bus stop info is only available at major bus stops in the city and selected ones at suburbs, the most heartburn is that the last bus arrival time is not that accurate.<br>In HK, 95% of bus stops have the relevant info ie. bus fare, route destination. Even in the bus itself, (KMB Aircon buses in Gold Livery) for instance has bus stop arrival annoucement &amp; next bus stop Electronic Display Panel in Mandarin &amp; English in the buses, in addition to the route destination info displayed permanently in the buses.<br>Our SBS svc have the route leaflet available, but how often do you see them? they either not topped up by the BCs or dun even have the rack for it (some sv36 do not have racks)</div>
