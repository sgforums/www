              <p><br>That was 334 case before the capacity was beefed up. Now with 8 DDs and 1 SD, tell me this is the case. Observed 334 at Jurong. Long queue but when the DD comes 90-100 pax enter the bus and only 15-20 are remaining, not because they cannot squeeze in but they are aware that in a few mins another 334 DD will come where they will get place to sit.</p>
              <p>Anyway, people may leave 1 bus for a seat, never more than 1 and waiting time never more than 10-12 mins. This is the max.</p>

              <p>Not trying to defend SMRT or LTA here, but I don't think it's appropriate to say all of their BSEP enhancements on SMRT is ineffective just because of 190.</p>
              <p>The fact is, most of us knows putting SD BSEP buses on 190 is not going to do much. There's almost 30 bendies and 10 plus SD on 190, so why would adding 3 BSEP MAN to it give any visible effect?</p>
              <p>As the operator, they have to do something about it. Adding more BSEP buses will do moot, since it does not signficantly increase capacity. Adding existing bendies, well this is possible by reorg some of the other services, but this also causes problems on the road infra. As for adding new high capacity buses, do remember it takes time for buses to be build, it does not magically appear. I hope smrt has made the more appropiate decision to convert themselves into a mixed dd and bendy fleet but that is still yet to be determined.</p>
              <p>As the commuter, the gov't has pushed DBTF in order to reduce penalty on transfers to nil, so make use of it! Travel smart and use apps if you have a smartphone to find alternative routes. In that example, taking a bus down to raffles town club will most probably get the person a space on 190 or 700.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, we cannot expect the gov't to solve each and every single problem. Do your own part as a commuter to help yourself. The video is good to show exactly how bad the situation is, but it does nothing at all to help with the situation. Likewise, don't you think it's about time for you (BusAnalayzer) to promote yourself to BusConsultant and give suggestions to problems after analyzing?</p>

              <p>yes i am aware the line can go thrice the length of railing. when DD came, left 1/2 to 1 length of railing.</p>

              <p>But is only 190 operating inefficiently?</p>
              <p>What about sv 969? Have you seen the queues at Tampines Int? Even longer than the 334 queue. On top of it made it WAB, and hence bendy capacity will never increase on this route?</p>
              <p>What about 61/811/854/857/985? Daily problem on all these services. And these are just a few to mention. The Woodlands Industrial area is not even properly taken care of by SMRT like SBST does for JIS or where 78/79 plies.</p>

              <p>Me too 334 route. Sometimes 15min not a bus during peak when I was waiting for one 334. Sometimes SBST didn't deploy the right bus to cope the queue situation. Like u said, sometimes thrice the length of the railing(got one time queue about1-2m away from the back BC rest area, behind 197 queue berth) and deploy 5001 or Cameo SD.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, agreed. But at least the relief is, it is almost full fleet bendy. Though with bendy the bigger issue is people not moving to the end. And BC cannot shout and tell people at the rare to move behind.</p>

              <p>Actually 61 does not need to ply all the way to Eunos. SBST can take care of that sector and have routes in parallel.</p>
              <p>61 main loading comes along BBT to Clementi Road to Commonwealth and Alexandra Road. The route can be easily reduced to Bukit Merah Int via Henderson road or Harbourfront Int or even Shenton Way Terminal.</p>
              <p>This way frequency can be improved. 61 have hardly any high capacity buses anymore. During SBST days had so many DDs on it. Even frequency highly uncertain.</p>

              <p>Take 969 for an example, imo it has a fleet use+pax turnover issue because loadings are perfectly ok. Pax dont get off until 30mins later, and thus everyone wants to get a seat.

If you want to stand on 969 just queue at the side and you can board the next bus as standee.</p>
              <p>If the queue is there because they want to get a seat, i dont think that should be considered a problem so long as the standees can all board.</p>

              <p>Remember that part of the trunk routes operated by SMRT duplicates with their train services which in your example is both 857 and 985 to a certain extent. The passenger pools is partly shared with the trains, but since they can fully utilise the SD buses, why would they put higher capacity buses there? They would rather not be spending money by improving on services that they can cater to with trains. I.e. Fighting for the same revenue source within the company.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is why SMRT seem to sit back and just focus on their train operations now while SBST is doing alot to compete with pax that would normally take the trains.</p>
              <p>Of course they are taking action, but only on services that wont affect their train ops (969A and premium services anyone?). So much for a profit generating multi-modal transport company.</p>
              <p>One thing i hope not to see is SBST letting go of bus services along their DTL corridor, but as a public listed company, it still waits to be seen if their interest is on profits for shareholders or passengers.</p>

                          their train operations now while SBST is doing alot to compete with
                          pax that would normally take the trains.</p>
              <p>Of course they are taking action, but only on services that wont
                          affect their train ops (969A and premium services anyone?). So much
                          for a profit generating multi-modal transport company.</p>
              <p>One thing i hope not to see is SBST letting go of bus services
                          along their DTL corridor, but as a public listed company, it still
                          waits to be seen if their interest is on profits for shareholders
                          or passengers.</p>

              <p>That is a partial answer.</p>
              <p>Notice that in the video, the lady correctly pointed out that there was ample space at the rear and none of the drivers took any initiative.</p>
              <p>How does LTA and PTOs know whether the buses are overcrowded? Clue: It is not done by simply pressing the tally counter.</p>

              <p>N the drivers still purposely close the exit doors without checking? 14 buses in 100 mins. Is it enough? Average 7-8 mins frequency on a Friday night with some rigid as well ? I think sbstransit is having at least 4-5 mins frequency last time n with full fleet DD.  n maybe Tom night we will see mr Lui standing at that bus stop</p>
