              <p>It is really funny how you always compare 85 and 965. These two have completely different routes. The only common thing is that both of them ply Yishun Ave 2. Apart from that tell me one stop within Sengkang, these two have in common.</p>
              <p>965 definitely has more loading than 85. If 85 had 965's route and vice-versa, I bet it would have split shift high capacity buses.</p>

              <p>You don't comment on facts. Here they are: comment on the facts.</p>
              <p>My main pain point is: LTA launched BSEP more than a year ago. SMRT floated the tender for high capacity buses more than a year ago. SBST got DDs as part of BSEP. SMRT got just MANs. After all this, there is still no decision from SMRT management on high capacity buses. The population growth is one of the highest in SMRT area. There are so many routes that need capacity enhancement. Today they take off one bendy from 61/ 811 / 969 then add it to another service and show it as improvement. To make services WAB, services have to suffer with lesser high capacity buses.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Good move on 811A. This was needed. You know why suddenly SMRT is introducing all these 811A, 857A, 969A because first it has taken away bulk of the bendies from these services 811/969. 857 needs bendies but are not awarded. To ease the heavy loading, they have no option now but to keep introducing short working trips in the high loading areas. Overall, this is further going to affect the capacity and frequency in areas out of the short working route. This to many may be an improvement but it is just re-aligning of resources to overcome their shortcoming. I know you will argue that SBST has it too, and that's why I am explaining the scenario above to you that it is to cover the loss of high capacity buses.</p></div>

              <p>BSEP Morning and Evening Express seems to be a problem given that SMRT only obtains A22s for these services.</p>
              <p>could make these to accomodate only seating pax, however it could lead to a bigger problem.</p>

              <p>178's case the BSEP add was really redundant because most of the drivers reached 'very early' and it was enough for me to ride on other services.</p>
