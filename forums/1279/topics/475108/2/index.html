              <p>That is a partial answer.</p>
              <p>Notice that in the video, the lady correctly pointed out that
                  there was ample space at the rear and none of the drivers took any
                  initiative.</p>
              <p>How does LTA and PTOs know whether the buses are overcrowded?
                  Clue: It is not done by simply pressing the tally counter.</p>
              <p>Connect the dots and you will see why the improvements (if any)
                  were inadequate.</p>

              <p>I do understand that the IDFC is also responsible for keeping track of the current pax onboard the buses, the actions by drivers is just an additional way to highlight full buses.</p>
              <p>In that case, shouldnt LTA downrate the "max" capacity for bendies to accomodate for people not moving in?</p>
              <p>That should force SMRT to restrategize it's deployment of buses to cope with the more "accurate" capacity until the issue is resolved by training their drivers to get people to move in.</p>

              <p>Although I still dont really agree with you esp on services like 334, but lets agree to disagree. I would like to say something else that i feel is the root of the problem.</p>
              <p>The strange part, which since you have a MBA should be able to see thorugh this.</p>
              <p>I do full agree with you on services such as 857 and 985 needing more high capacity buses, but unfortunately they will never get them. Its not that SMRT cannot run a bus operations properly, but rather they are looking at this from a financial perspective.</p>
              <p>Remember that part of the trunk routes operated by SMRT duplicates with their train services which in your example is both 857 and 985 to a certain extent. The passenger pools is partly shared with the trains, but since they can fully utilise the SD buses, why would they put higher capacity buses there? They would rather not be spending money by improving on services that they can cater to with trains. I.e. Fighting for the same revenue source within the company.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is why SMRT seem to sit back and just focus on their train operations now while SBST is doing alot to compete with pax that would normally take the trains.</p>
              <p>Of course they are taking action, but only on services that wont affect their train ops (969A and premium services anyone?). So much for a profit generating multi-modal transport company.</p>
              <p>One thing i hope not to see is SBST letting go of bus services along their DTL corridor, but as a public listed company, it still waits to be seen if their interest is on profits for shareholders or passengers.</p>

              <p>Well you are right. I have a MBA and hence, most of my comments are taking the business perspective in mind. I don't see economic sense in just adding buses when you can do the same with plying higher capacity buses. You pay the BC more, you spend more on the fuel, ERP, maintenance, monitoring - everything right?</p>
              <p>Regarding 985, how does it parallel EWL/NSL? The route is completely different. Regarding 857, the same goes. It is a faster alternative via CTE to city and with the heavy crowds on NSL, SMRT should promote services like 857 even more. That means SBST should deploy only SDs on 107, 133, 147 as most of its route parallels the NEL. I don't get your logic here - so maybe we agree to disagree :)</p>
              <p>What upsets me is the time the management has taken to make a decision on high capacity buses - more than a year back the tender was floated. Nothing really has been done about it. As most other users here also have mentioned, they need to get DDs. As other users are saying, SMRT is completely relying on its improvements through BSEP. Now to me, it just seems that you are biased to not see where they are failing!?</p>

              <p>I think it is important to note that nearly all of the BSEP fleet additions by SMRT including the ones for 190 are split shifts... they should try to time their high capacity buses to arrive at certain major bus stops/bus interchanges better.... but most importantly, SMRT should wake up and smell the coffee, and get double deckers as soon as it can!</p>

              <p><br>Yes the rear of most buses standing has space. I had once asked a SL on bendy on 854 on HG Ave 3. The bendy was full with ample space at the rare. I spotted this and told the SL. He said that he can't shout in the other boggie of the bus (these were his words). And to think of it he is right, even if he yells from the front of the bus, hardly the people at the back will here it. At least for rigids and DDs they can do it and do it many times.</p>
              <p>And this has become an everyday thing for them, so I think they have even lost sensitivity around it.</p>

              <p><br>LTA does not shrug in taking bold decisions. I don't know why they are waiting on 190. They should at least try giving it back to SBST. They have the DDs to ply on it. BBDEP can do sv 190. It can transfer 170/170X to SMRT to make it equal and SMRT can happily deploy its rigids on it and no one will bother.</p>

              <p><br> Yes, agreed. But at least the relief is, it is almost full fleet

              <p>Yes, based on my observation you're right. But instead of deploying full bendy fleet in non-peak, they can bring rigids in at random invervals. Then deploy two bendies during peak our for each run. Once I see BC come via back door and say move back. Damn jialat. 300's fleet IS full bendy. Not almost. Those rigids you see are x-overs from 188. But something is bad, 300 sometimes during peak hours go downroute. This causes bus stops before Sunshine Place to be too crowded. That's why school-going kids like me have to take the bus before 6:40AM or be late for school.</p>

              <p>I do full agree with you on services such as 857 and 985 needing
              more high capacity buses, but unfortunately they will never get
              them. Its not that SMRT cannot run a bus operations properly, but
