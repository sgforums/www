              <p><br>But from where? I can understand their issue. The moment they deploy a bendy on 857, they will have to pull it out from another service and the problem will start with that service. Just adding BSEP buses is really not helping because as someone here only said "people decide when they want to take a bus and not the other way round." So in many cases you don't need a BSEP rigid add, you just need a higher capacity bus.</p>

              <p>As you suggested, this puts a question mark to the topic, at the same time, it does not state that BSEP has been completely ineffective for SMRT. Because if BSEP was not there, imagine services 190, 857, 966 without the BSEP adds.</p>

              <p>I hope LTA can tender the CBD/MRT-duplicate routes to a willing operator, who can then bring in DDs to the respective necessary services eg. 190, 857 and 700/A. Then SMRT can bring in only bendies to help its Intratowns, feeders and other necessary trunks eg. 67. </p>
              <p>But at the end of the day it is still depending on whether LTA wanna clear the boundaries or not. </p>

              <p>That's not true. If both the bendies and DD are from the same manufacturer and shares largely similar components (drivetrain, axle systems, etc) then it does not increase maintenance overheads, yet increasing the flexibility of using the more appropriate buses on each service.</p>
              <p>For example, if SBST went with Scania for KUDs then they share very similar components with its KUB. Similarly with SMRT, they could go all MAN and lower costs on keeping spares and training mechanics.</p>

              <p>I think our government has been smart enough to plan well. It has not developed Singapore in one go. If you see so much area was always guarded off and no development was allowed. This was better than mass developing the whole country like it has been done in many cities across the world.</p>
              <p>We still have chance for another few decades to grow if we develop smart. </p>
