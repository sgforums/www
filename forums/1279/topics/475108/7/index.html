              u sure less cars in future? look at the no. of condominiums and houses being built. if more and more people can afford the more than $1million hse; what is a $150k car to them? if PT service not going to improve, i dont know what will happen in future.

              <p>I don't know if you realise it or not, but when I post that statement I have added a hidden meaning inside. </p>
              <p>Just because of more cars in the road that's why LTA wanted to have less cars in order to have a better PT system. And so LTA is blaming the cars for making PT system bad. And they did not realise that it is their own problem, their mistake in not realising how Singapore needs more competition in PT in order for PT to really improve. And also it is because of the cars that LTA and SMRT keep on hesitating on bendies. So if LTA continues this then PT would not be truly improved and there would still be a lot of cars. And thus SMRT's full fleet bendies would never happen alr. But even if that happens its better than having all rigids...</p>

              <p>A friend told me that AM loads to CCK from Bukit Panjang road also can be quite bad on sv 190. Since majority attention is given to CBD related loads in AM, I think it also impacting the AM load towards CCK these days. 190 is one of the only services connecting BPJ Road to CCK MRT.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think 190 will lose much loading. It will still be crowded. Remember, today many people don't take 190 even if it is the best option for them because it is so crowded. Once people transfer to DTL, those who take NSL to Orchard, will shift to 190.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, 920 and 922 also don't have very good frequency still. Earlier, it was HORRIBLE. I remember when I would go to BPJ, you could imagine 920/922 to have China style crowd in it because of frequency. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Honestly speaking, 882/920/922 seriously have low demand. I don't really think it's because of the frequency. Even if it's due to the frequency, there would be feedback(s) sent to SMRT, or even Stomp post.</p>

              <p>I second that. </p>
              <p>Besides, Why waste resources on an unpopular service? I mean, yes you may say it won't kill to add a bus or two, it will benefit some people, but the thing is there are other services who deserve it more. Anyways it will be good if the commuters that really depend on these services can plan their journey, or SMRT can adjust the time slots to suit the commuters' travel patterns. </p>

              <p>You can also have a timetable placed at the bus stop, like 882. Sadly speaking, there's really low demand for 882 too. I have seen events where 882 is somewhat crowded, during the Lance era. But still, I find that 2 buses is somewhat enough.</p>

              <p>Yah it is enough. It's not logical to add so much buses to a low-demad service and say that this is what BSEP should do, to reduce waiting times what. </p>
              <p>I mean, how many people are gonna benefit?</p>
              <p>Reason why service 882 is so low demand is becoz its exclusive areas are the ulu ulu areas of Northern Singapore, where the camping sites are located. Thank god it's 2 buses alr. </p>
              <p>Having timetables at the bus stop is another good thing, it's more convenient to see and you can just glance once in a while if you do chance upon a suay situation when you really have to wait for that bus. They can paste it like the ff services, or HK style, where they have this "stem and leaf" method to show the timings. </p>
