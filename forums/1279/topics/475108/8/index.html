              <p><br>I think with a peak frequency of 3-4 mins, bunching is unavoidable by the time the bus gets to Scotts Road. Anyway, by then the buses are so housefull that people who leave 2 buses, might at least get a place in 3rd bus.</p>

              <p>SMRT really needs to get their sh*t together and buy a lot more buses than they have now and make maintainence much better to even stand a chance against SBST. Bus shortage seems to be the problem and not "too little trips". Unless they have a lot of buses, frequency can't improve as we cannot forsee bus breakdowns due to their lack of maintainence for buses as if you take out the spares, then the other service has a bus breakdown, what happens?</p>

              <p>I agree. It has way too many excess DD buses for now and still registering. LTA should try to get SMRT to operate a few by paying SBST a fee either by SMRT or LTA to operate on services that need high capacity buses until SMRT makes up its mind. This is also a part of BSEP.</p>

              <p>Actually, since SBS Transit may have an excess number of Double
              Decker buses, <strong>is it possible for SMRT to pay SBS Transit
              some money (rental) and use SBST DD buses on their
              services?</strong></p>

              competition, I feel that SBS Transit actually does it better than
              SMRT. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">By the way, in terms of number of
              rail lines, including LRT, SBS Transit now runs the same number of
              rail lines as SMRT. </span></p>

              <p>A simpler option is to merge the two operators. Optionally it could be a nationalisation or a bus only merger.</p>

              <p>There is an organisation of last resort. CEOs of both bus operators were once in that organisation.</p>
              <p>In practice private bus operators would fill this role in other developed cities; this can be seen in planned or unplanned rail replacements.</p>
