            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys<br><br>I have decided to make some changes as you can see , to improve the quality of the forum. As I don't have much time to moderate , I want to make life easier for all the moderators . The rules are simple but if there are any doubts and need clarification, please give me or any of the moderators a private message, thanks.<br><br>Rule 1 :<br><br>I have set up the new thread folders, please ensure that the topic is relevant to the topic of the thread. Anything that is irrevelvant will be edited by the moderators. This is important because I noticed a lot of threads, topics tend to go way out of the original topic. <span style="color: red;">Post where it is approriate, remember!</span><br><br>Rule 2:<br><br>No flamewar posts are allowed in this forum. To ensure a friendly enviroment, please do not haul war of words or vulgurities among each other. I take this very seriously and if there is anyone that breached this rule will be given two warnings. The 3rd warning will means goodbye to this forum. Rudeness and rebellious behaviour to the <span style="color: red;">moderators</span> and <span style="color: red;">fellow forum users</span> will not be tolerated. Debates and small arguments are allowed but please keep it under control and settle in a friendly manner. No childish remarks are allowed in this forum like " Volvo buses are lousy" and that's it. . Please rephrase it and back up your statement.<br><br>Rule 3:<br><br>This is for anyone that wishes to post photos in this forum. Please ensure that permission must be asked <span style="color: red;">(If the photo is not yours) </span>before you post in the forum.<br><br>This is how it should be done.<br>Example:<br><br><img src="http://charlesryan.blogs.friendster.com/photos/my_top_10_aviation_photos/n801nwb-thumb.JPG"><br><br>Photo taken by Charles Ryan Teo.<br><br>If you are not sure of this rule, please clarifiy with any of the moderators, thanks.<br><br>On behalf of the moderators, I would like to thank each and everyone of you for visiting this forum. Remember, without you, this forum won't exist. This rules may be strict to some of you but it's important to ensure the quality of the forum and let the forum grow even bigger.<br><br>Thank you for your support.<br><br></div>
