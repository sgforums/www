              <p>Don't test my patience. I'm telling you ONE LAST TIME. It's an OPEN FORUM. So you can whine about Merc for all I care. I've not been troubled so far by your comments UNTIL NOW. Nobody said you CANNOT comment about the Merc.</p>
              <p>Seriously this is one of the reasons why I choose to take a step back from SGF. Because of stupid retards like you. Cannot interpret what others say and choose to go by your own stupid way. I dare you NOW to go dig up my past posts and quote WHICH POST have I ever blasted you for making comments about Merc. I DARE YOU. Since you're so thinking you're SO RIGHT, then I shall give you a piece of my mind. So just because 9888Y says people are getting annoyed at you, does it mean <strong>EVERYONE</strong> is being frustrated? Because I wasn't. So STOP twisting facts.</p>
              <p>If like what 9888Y said that "people was getting annoyed over you", then you should go REFLECT upon what is making people THINK SO instead of being so stiff, so obstinate and so stubborn as to continue insisting you're CORRECT. I've always let you have your own say until when you used unintelligent responses to shoot me back. So yes, you just annoyed me. Pretty much.</p>
              <p>I'd rather spend less time talking to nonsencical people like you who cannot understand what others say. So I shan't go any further and waste my breath.</p>

              <p>Like you say,so far i haven't got anything to do with you.i admit that there are no posts in which we have ever argued.but the arguement was initially between me and 9888Y.so who ask you to be kaypoh and interfere in this matter?actually it is you who made this matter more worse.if you had not interfered in this,this matter wouldn't have came so far.and since when in any of my posts did i ever say that i think that i am SO RIGHT as u accuse me?u acted big just now right?so now its my turn to act big.I DARE YOU TO DIG ALL MY POSTS TO SEE IF I EVER SAID THAT I WAS THINKING THAT I WAS SO RIGHT.I DARE YOU NOW.so u think i will be so scared just because you type 'I DARE U' in caps?this is all nothing to me man.so you are trying to show me that you are very fierce by saying that you are going to show me a piece of your mind?do you think that i will be scared of your 'threat'?and if u want to stay away from sgforums,by all means go ahead.who needs retarded morons like you?do you think that you are very important to sgforums?do you think that without you,the whole sgbusforums will close down?please lah.dont act big here lah.actually to tell you the truth,i have never wanted to start a arguement with you in the first place.if you hadn't shot me so seriously just now,all this arguement now between you and me wouldn't have started.so think carefully before you post again.i dont want to argue with you anymore.</p>

              <p><br>Yup. I have also noticed that CSS194M had not been doing any services as well. Seems like some of the Nissan UDs had already been taken out from service though they were not officially laid up yet, except for service 178 which still have a few. Same for some of the Scania ELBOs on service 187 too which had apparantly disappeared.</p>

              <p>I like Merc as well, but does anyone get annoyed over me? I don't think so. Good and bad buses are sometimes judge by personal preferences, so what if people says that it's a lousy piece of crap? It's not necessary to be so agressive over this, so be it, if the person thinks that it's lousy, as long as the person didn't get overboard saying that particular merc is lousy when it can be considered good enough.</p>
              <p>How would you rate SBS88Z? Good or bad, some may say good, some may say lousy. I shall take SBS503S as example. Annoying loud whirring sound, good aircon, good acceleration, no much problem (can be said good enough). What do you think? Good or bad? Some rate it as lousy, because of the engine sound, which may be some faults technically. Some rate it as good because of good aircon and acceleration. Some are neutral about it.</p>
              <p>BCs and mech can comment on the buses too, they might say those "good buses" that you rate as lousy buses, maybe due to the performance? Problematic bus = mech's prob, they might need to do frequent touch ups and get irritated over this and rate it as lousy. Can become BC's prob too, when the bus breakdown or any technical faults that causes accidents.</p>
              <p>Don't need to be so aggressive over small matter like such. So what if one of the merc is lousy, can you do anything to it? Are you able to repair to make it good? You're unable to do it right? All you can do is complaining when nothing will be done, so, what for? Might as well save your time and energy, dun complain, no flame wars will be started and you won't get yourself into trouble.</p>
