              <p>This is why I sometimes thinking of using the forum less often like Kok Pern. Fancy argueing over a Merc and it has to blow up to this big and even to the extent of scolding people vulgarities. Scolding people vulgarities over a Merc??</p>
              <p>To Mercrox: Like I said to you before, don't EVER use gangsterism to deal with people. For all you might know, you might be sued or even get thrown into boys home for intimidation. You seriously really need to watch what you're saying.</p>
