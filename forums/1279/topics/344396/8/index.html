              <p>c'mon, if everyone were to keep a cool head and don't fucking make rude comments to each other then this wouldn't even happen in the first place.</p>
              <p>it seems that this argument's over a host of problems. but do we have to make and out and out attack on a person who's made a mistake?</p>
              <p>i won't comment on who's wrong and who's right in this argument simply because i won't be bothered to go read through all the pages to find out what sparked off a dispute.</p>
              <p>but please, keep all nasty comments to ourselves, and if someone tries to provoke another, please. ignore. of course, this is depending on the situation. perpetually annoying people deserve to, and will get flamed. but provided the flaming does not go on to include a person's family, calling the person names, etc.</p>

              <p><br>i guess then, it's because people refuse to listen to advice, that's why the flame wars don't go.</p>
              <p>it's not that the flame wars came back, it's because they never left in the first place.</p>
              <p>an all out attack on each other just makes each other get more and more pissed till someone will start a flame war.</p>
              <p>i believw we've told them countless times, the PM function is there for a reason, but people refuse to use the PM.</p>
              <p>i don't know, maybe they think the PM is a "gay" way to voice their unhappiness or they just wanna post it on the outside to garner attention to their cause...</p>
              <p>but surely. this shouldn't be happening in the bus community.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, let me clarify with you guys before it gets worsened...<br><br>FIrst is the use of vulgarities in this forum. I'm very sure you might get hurt or offended if someone harasses you vulgarities. This kind of behaviour is anti-social and you will regret it later. I don't think that you will like you being scolded vulgarities and hurling each other just because of some kind of disputes being publicised on the forums, and ended up being upset, frustrating or whatever negative feelings that you have when the vulgarities backfires on you.<br><br>Secondly, there are people who makes a small disputes to become a major problem in the forums which ended up in a heated discussion over one party to another (eg. One of the scenarios like Mercrox who dislike certain Mercs and show off his anger against it and later people like SBS9888Y and Oceane goes to the thread and posted to try him to stop but this has abused). This is the only solution that will make people to stop being involved in any flamings and not to let the controversy going and ended up the particular thread with 100 pages of nonsensical or off topic stuff. I and the other bus fans are very sure that if the person just continues the debate, you won't like it if people keep asking you to stop repeatedly. In fact, again, its getting too far apart and that does make no sense to the growth of the bus community here by posting irrevelant stuff at the forums. Do not abuse the friendliness of other bus fans by trying to bring trouble at anytime.<br><br>Lastly, I'm sure every bus fans are matured enough, and don't act like a childish person, be independent, always find solutions to stop the matter quickly and not to add fuel to the fire. It's very annoying for each thread, with all kind of unneccessary posts being posted just because to pin-point at one another because of some kind of disputed issues being discussed. This will carry on until someone has to stop and to resolve the matter as soon as possible, so that you won't get away with it. No point crying over spilt milk over such issues. It's as simple, bus is a bus, and that's it. Don't bring any buses you dislike over any threads, because each time you emphasise more on that, it will get even worsened.<br><br>Mercrox: Please read what I've just said and hope that you will understand. Should you have any queries, feel free to PM me to let the problem solve faster, instead of just continually flaming you back unneccessary (and it's very annoying to others). Take my advice at once: Try to relax and calm down and don't keep discussing all over it to avoid having the same cycle repeating.</div>

              <p>Ok, let me clarify with you guys before it gets worsened...<br><br>FIrst is the use of vulgarities in this forum. I'm very sure you might get hurt or offended if someone harasses you vulgarities. This kind of behaviour is anti-social and you will regret it later. I don't think that you will like you being scolded vulgarities and hurling each other just because of some kind of disputes being publicised on the forums, and ended up being upset, frustrating or whatever negative feelings that you have when the vulgarities backfires on you.<br><br>Secondly, there are people who makes a small disputes to become a major problem in the forums which ended up in a heated discussion over one party to another (eg. <strong>One of the scenarios like Mercrox</strong> <strong>who dislike certain Mercs and show off his anger against it and later people like SBS9888Y and Oceane goes to the thread and posted to try him to stop but this has abused</strong>). This is the only solution that will make people to stop being involved in any flamings and not to let the controversy going and ended up the particular thread with 100 pages of nonsensical or off topic stuff. I and the other bus fans are very sure that if the person just continues the debate, you won't like it if people keep asking you to stop repeatedly. In fact, again, its getting too far apart and that does make no sense to the growth of the bus community here by posting irrevelant stuff at the forums. Do not abuse the friendliness of other bus fans by trying to bring trouble at anytime.<br><br>Lastly, I'm sure every bus fans are matured enough, and don't act like a childish person, be independent, always find solutions to stop the matter quickly and not to add fuel to the fire. It's very annoying for each thread, with all kind of unneccessary posts being posted just because to pin-point at one another because of some kind of disputed issues being discussed. This will carry on until someone has to stop and to resolve the matter as soon as possible, so that you won't get away with it. No point crying over spilt milk over such issues. It's as simple, bus is a bus, and that's it. Don't bring any buses you dislike over any threads, because each time you emphasise more on that, it will get even worsened.<br><br>Mercrox: Please read what I've just said and hope that you will understand. Should you have any queries, feel free to PM me to let the problem solve faster, instead of just continually flaming you back unneccessary (and it's very annoying to others). Take my advice at once: Try to relax and calm down and don't keep discussing all over it to avoid having the same cycle repeating.</p>
