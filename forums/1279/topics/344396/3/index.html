              <p>Don't test my patience. I'm telling you ONE LAST TIME. It's an OPEN FORUM. So you can whine about Merc for all I care. I've not been troubled so far by your comments UNTIL NOW. Nobody said you CANNOT comment about the Merc.</p>
              <p>Seriously this is one of the reasons why I choose to take a step back from SGF. Because of stupid retards like you. Cannot interpret what others say and choose to go by your own stupid way. I dare you NOW to go dig up my past posts and quote WHICH POST have I ever blasted you for making comments about Merc. I DARE YOU. Since you're so thinking you're SO RIGHT, then I shall give you a piece of my mind. So just because 9888Y says people are getting annoyed at you, does it mean <strong>EVERYONE</strong> is being frustrated? Because I wasn't. So STOP twisting facts.</p>
              <p>If like what 9888Y said that "people was getting annoyed over you", then you should go REFLECT upon what is making people THINK SO instead of being so stiff, so obstinate and so stubborn as to continue insisting you're CORRECT. I've always let you have your own say until when you used unintelligent responses to shoot me back. So yes, you just annoyed me. Pretty much.</p>
              <p>I'd rather spend less time talking to nonsencical people like you who cannot understand what others say. So I shan't go any further and waste my breath.</p>

                  Well, I guess u wouldnt like it if this issue turns into a heated argument and ppl retaliates you back negatively. First thing u should have discussed the issue through private means (i.e. PM, MSN, etc.). Secondly, dun repeat the same thing becoz ppl may comment not the bus u hate but it will shoot back to u.. My recommendations is when ppl say u noisy or disturbing, better put it into a stop, if not you will worsened the situation. Be able to solve the problem faster and not add fuel into the fire. Dun keep retaliating back. DO take that in mind
