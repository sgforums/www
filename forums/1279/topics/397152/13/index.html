              <p>if you think 13-14 mins headway for full trips is not enough to cope, you are going against your proposal to reinstate 502A and have even fewer trips than <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">before</span> now.</p>
              <p>if you feel express services deserve an extra bus during evening peak out of goodwill, and then a basic service failed QoS because there are no more buses, nobody is going to pity the bus company. so it is silly to do that. a failed basic service has greater consequences.</p>
              <p>back to your observation, i was at MBS this evening and even though buses were reasonably packed (c'mon it's peak hour), everyone managed to board. but then we come back to expectations - if basic services are just as reasonably packed (and not exceeding 95 percent), what do express services deserve anything extra? it is only an express routing, there's no guaranteed seats which are classified under premium.</p>

              <p><br>There are 11 downroutes from the Delfi @ Orchard from 7.50pm in the evening till the end of operations, and that is not enough?</p>
              <p>The round trip buses even bunched with downroute buses. At around 9pm I think there were 4 buses within close range of each other near Marina Bay, 9014C 9016Y 5150T and 3914U (in order).</p>
              <p>And I think you need to appreciate the fact that SLBP despatched all 4 5N crossovers proper yesterday, if not frequencies would be worse. I think if you had to take 518 from town at 6pm/7pm you'd be cursing and swearing. The scheduled headway was about 1 hour and they reduced it to 40 + 40 after pulling 1 bus forward by 20 mins. Reason? BN didn't despatch proper the first 3 4N crossovers and only inserted them as downroutes somewere near Marina Bay. So all those in Orchard areas all suffer.</p>
