              <p>i don't know what you mean. i only know you just want your far east plaza to pioneer link back, and am not contended with providing "just a feedback".</p>
              <p>you mean SBST can amend or withdraw routes as and when it wish to? or do you believe you can represent your Pioneer constituency better than your MP can? or don't you think he needs to talk to Hong Kah's MP to see if he's okay with his residents waiting so long for sv 502 bus to come?</p>
              <p>i will only entertain you as far as this point. the discussion is obviously not getting anywhere if you take insights of bus operations as mockery. service_238 has already given his piece of valuable info, but looks like everyone else has a greater use for it.</p>

              <p>If I were you I'd go make 502 frequency 1 hour, since the new changes to 502 is not being appreciated so might as well downgrade it further (remove all DDs!)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Obviously your knowledge and skills in this area is being underestimated when you have a stupid person with no brains and only know how to talk nonsense with no concrete evidence whatsoever. Talk big, but don't dare to act. Act as if this person know everything; bus fans here all are more clever, mature, knowledgeable and flexible than that person. Maybe this person doesn't even deserve this service to town. People know how to take advice and appreciate the knowledge that people provide but this person can't. What a societal scumbag.</p>

              <p>I am frequent traveller for this service. I had someone feeding the information required. Everytime pushes things to MP, is that what SBS Transit does these days? Going to an extra mile? PM had been actively pushing these to all service sector these few years.</p>
              <p>Before the removal, I had taken more than 4 times a week on the first trip of express 502A. The bus I took was SBS 9016Y. Indeed it is not pack but the loading is still ok but not low.</p>

Seriously, people like you have caused a topic to go very out of point. Would you just appect that every depot/bus park has their own stength and weakness? Is your english that bad until you don't understand what are people talking? Seriously looking at your reply, i'm having the doubt if you are still a teenager or just a plain immature adult. I'm not interested to start a flame war with you anyways but seriously, THIS HAS TO STOP, SOMEHOW!  It's rather fustrating to see one thread after one thread where chicken little2 is arguing with other bus fans which i find not needed here. Want to argue? Debate about your Disagreements, THE PM IS THERE FOR A PURPOSE! sheesh!</p></div>

              <p>chickenlittle, if you really want your suggestions to be carried out, make sure you have supports. one person's opinion is not the deciding factor for amendments. Route planners do surveys, even on their own. They will not show "I am a route planner" on their forehead.</p>

              <p>if you think 13-14 mins headway for full trips is not enough to cope, you are going against your proposal to reinstate 502A and have even fewer trips than <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">before</span> now.</p>
              <p>if you feel express services deserve an extra bus during evening peak out of goodwill, and then a basic service failed QoS because there are no more buses, nobody is going to pity the bus company. so it is silly to do that. a failed basic service has greater consequences.</p>
              <p>back to your observation, i was at MBS this evening and even though buses were reasonably packed (c'mon it's peak hour), everyone managed to board. but then we come back to expectations - if basic services are just as reasonably packed (and not exceeding 95 percent), what do express services deserve anything extra? it is only an express routing, there's no guaranteed seats which are classified under premium.</p>
