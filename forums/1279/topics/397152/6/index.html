              <p>most of the pax are not on that side of the road. PTC won't approve. not forgetting a double loop in e marina area just to serve suntec along temasek blvd/ave.</p>
              <p>well, what if people start complaining long waiting times in the evening peak for any kind of relavent sv502 variant that brings them home? after all, people can't be late for work, whereas fewer people have to meet a timeline for going home lest they get fired from home.</p>
              <p>of course, as a resident of Pioneer, you can seek your MP or SLBP friend's help to feedback, they might consider it seriously. but i can foresee headway nearing 40mins after the last 502A/502B has left, versus a maximum headway of 20mins after 7.45pm and 13-14mins before.</p>

              <p>If you see the new route, passengers taking from scotts road is also badly affected.</p>
              <p>I believe to ask them to stop using Boon Lay way will solve the root of the problem during the evening slot. From the past experience, most of the 502B and 502 were late because of using that route. If it takes more than 95 mins to complete the journey from the city to Pioneer, I will think the express buses is not be meeting their basic requirement.</p>
              <p>I dun see a need of bringing out a MP or my friend in the discussion. I believe the HQ should be doing this job. Nevertheless, let's monitor the travelling time for svc 502 during the peak hrs to pioneer.</p>

              <p>that sentence is selfish. how about those working in suntec? you mean they shld be treated equally too?</p>
              <p>if you feel journey time is a priority over a direct journey, why not take the train? nobody is stopping you, you know.</p>
              <p>HQ? good. write in to CRC. they'll handle it. of cos, if such grassroot representative as a MP agrees with you this time round and will speak for you, i'm sure HQ will do something for you. they're one of the people who will be consulted when there are route changes after all.</p>

              <p>I think Express Routes earn more than Trunk Routes...and Trunk routes will fall into PTC's stricter QoS guidelines - which may prove to be more trouble than help. Considering that 502 is still pretty profitable (or so I think), there isn't a need for them to convert it :P.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another note, I feel that 133M should be extended to Chinatown instead of terminating at Shenton Way :) - and it could be given a new number too in that sense...unless "M" variant routes don't fall under Basic Service QoS but are considered additional supplementary trips?</p>

              <p>that sentence is selfish. how about those working in suntec? you mean they shld be treated equally too?</p>
              <p>if you feel journey time is a priority over a direct journey, why not take the train? nobody is stopping you, you know.</p>
              <p>HQ? good. write in to CRC. they'll handle it. of cos, if such grassroot representative as a MP agrees with you this time round and will speak for you, i'm sure HQ will do something for you. they're one of the people who will be consulted when there are route changes after all.</p>

              <p>you're being selfish here. why must people from far east plaza take the shortest route home, if they're already taking the shortest route there? why for the sake of these people do you propose that people from suntec cross the road to the other side of SICEC to wait for the bus? why should we increase the mileage when the other way works fine?</p>
              <p>do you consider how long scheduled headways are running the variant routes? if there are enough buses then why are the headways so long after the last 502A/B trips? that's even before we talk about operated headways. if you think in the current regime of QoS that direct AND fast journey times is still a priority, tell me why evening premium trips were rejected outright by PTC. good times are over.</p>
              <p>pray tell, what is LTA &amp; PTC for? you think route amendments can be carried out independent of PTC? if your MP does not write to you personally to inform you of the upcoming changes to the bus routes in your area does not mean he is not in the loop.</p>
