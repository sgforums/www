              I had always heard from LTA and SBS that they will minimize the

              <p>Seriously, not enough bus than additional bus should be
              deployed. This is when there are demand. <br>
              why evening premium trips were rejected outright by PTC? Private
              operators are operating them in the evening. Compare the price and
              the places they go. One going from CBD to estate and another
              from shopping district + office building to estate.</p>
              <p>The final decision still lies on LTA and PTC and SBS.</p>

              <p>that's because there are passengers who will benefit from this, but others are affected because they've been enjoying a privilege at the expense of others.</p>
              <p>do you really think loading is that important on an express service? this is not your grandfather's bus company. every bus added is a cost, and this is most justified when added to a basic bus service to aid in its loading. an express bus can be loaded 110% and PTC won't fine a single cent.</p>
              <p>the reason is private operators? if a bus is a bus, why ain't PTO's allowed to operate? you have no idea how bus operations work. even someone more senior like ZYX2005, service_238, TIB1232Z and SBS7485P (to name a few) will know why you can't pluck buses out to run premium during the PM peak like you do with AM peak.</p>
              <p>final decision with LTA? then your MP is a figurehead? you have not known how many amendments were vetoed by grassroots, some as far as after the notices went up on the bus stop poles, like sv 115.</p>

              <p>Is rather difficult to determine who been enjoying a privilege at the expense of others.</p>
              <p>I think I am speaking as a customer point of view rather than bus operations.  It's all about cost saving rather at the expense of the passengers rather than cannot do. This is not only said by me but also the people working in SBS Transit. Business models need to be improved. Never fine means can do watever they want? You are like telling me SBS Transit need to learn things in a hard way.</p>
