              <p>But to them seemsÂ $$ matters 1st. Remember how ugly was it esp when Evergreen left for Johor? "We dun compete w/ price". See wat happened ltr. Earn less dun want, lose everything later kpkb. Tat time PSA's boss was Dr YNH, a former defence mini star.</p>

              <p>U're simply trying to play 'I'm e boss' here. SBS has to serve everyone and mind u, u obviously never been thru e days SBS was frantically trying to serve everyone in the 1970s era w/ New Town boom.</p>
              <p>U say serve Orchard, dare to complain abt C'wealth Ave West close one eye abt Orchard Blvd and PIE evening jam. Over there, u can't complain abt e traffic light timing cycle? Only blame buses.</p>
              <p>Let me tell u, lots of places jam is because of traffic light scheme nothing else.</p>
              <p>Dun use Boon Lay Way.. OK, straight go to PIE. Return leg how? No right turn to Toh Guan Rd/ HDB area and making uÂ - turn not easy for bus.</p>
              <p>As for C'wealth Ave West, it's a trade off as after tat it's a breeze along Ulu Pandan &amp; Holland Rd. Look at e overall benefit vs a small stretch <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>you're being selfish here. why must people from far east plaza take the shortest route home, if they're already taking the shortest route there? why for the sake of these people do you propose that people from suntec cross the road to the other side of SICEC to wait for the bus? why should we increase the mileage when the other way works fine?</p>
              <p>do you consider how long scheduled headways are running the variant routes? if there are enough buses then why are the headways so long after the last 502A/B trips? that's even before we talk about operated headways. if you think in the current regime of QoS that direct AND fast journey times is still a priority, tell me why evening premium trips were rejected outright by PTC. good times are over.</p>
              <p>pray tell, what is LTA &amp; PTC for? you think route amendments can be carried out independent of PTC? if your MP does not write to you personally to inform you of the upcoming changes to the bus routes in your area does not mean he is not in the loop.</p>

              <p>U say serve Orchard, dare to complain abt C'wealth Ave West close one eye abt Orchard Blvd and PIE evening jam. Over there, u can't complain abt e traffic light timing cycle? Only blame buses.</p>

              <p>Dun use Boon Lay Way.. OK, straight go to PIE. Return leg how? No right turn to Toh Guan Rd/ HDB area and making uÂ - turn not easy for bus.</p>
              <p>As for C'wealth Ave West, it's a trade off as after tat it's a breeze along Ulu Pandan &amp; Holland Rd. Look at e overall benefit vs a small stretch <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>True, jam is because of the traffic light scheme. So pls stop plying route having many traffic light. I share an example to you, when express 502 is in the express sector to orchard right?
