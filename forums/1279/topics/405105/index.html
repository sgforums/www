If this bus is supposed to be active under normal conditions, anyone might be able to provide some timing points, assuming it's assigned to the same piece of work / schedule everyday on route 855?

Aside from those two buses mentioned in my previous questions, I am interested in SBS9889U, SBS1688K and SBS8030L as well. I know they are assigned to route 166, 163 and 174 respectively.

              <p>1) if SMB136C doesn't pop out on any 2 consecutive days, means the SLs assigned to the bus are on Rest/Off. other than that the bus should come out as per normal on AM/PM duties.</p>
              <p>2) SBS7888K...this bus could be hard to say though...as SV 133 is doing jumpbus. it could come out on an A shift, but could just jump to and S/E and suddenly goes missing halfway.according to my guesses, this bus might not come out today.</p>
              <p>3) SBS9889U is usually a splitter, while SBS1688K is definitely a splitter. SBS8030L usually runs on full day duties. they shouldn't really be hard to find, unless they are due for maintenance.</p>

              to this vehicle, that this bus is always on "shift 902" these
              days............is it possible that someone might be able to
              discuss more details about this "shift 902", which I assume it's
              the regular assignment for this bus?<br> <br> 3.) Aside from those two buses mentioned in my previous questions,
              I am interested in SBS9889U, SBS1688K and SBS8030L as well. I know
              they are assigned to route 166, 163 and 174 respectively. After
              all, are they hard to find? Timing points will be
              appreciated.........although, this list belongs to my "secondary
              priorities". If I find them, awesome........if I don't, not a huge
              deal. =)</div>
              <div>Thank you very much</div>

              <p>Usually, u just have to camp for these buses..... Patience is all u need.... And, it seems like Citaro is "resting". Like what willis_chong said.......</p>
              <p>For SBS7888K, usually it would appear on 133..... If not, 133M... For the timings, I'm not so sure.... But, I think the 1st trip that it would make is 133, timing is around 0710 hours[I'm not so sure about this].</p>
              <p>SBS9899U, SBS1688K and SBS8030L are easy catches. Just need the Patience to "Camp" for these buses......</p>
