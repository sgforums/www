The O 306 used in Indonesia also emits a similar sound but slightly less noisy due to its smaller cc engine.<br><br>In fact right now in SGP, you can still find some Hino &amp; Scania with exhaust brakes in-use. The sound during braking can also be quite noisy but less noisy compared to the OF 1417, which i attribute as due to the smaller cc of the Hino with it &amp; charge-cooled engine in the case of Scania with it, like 1 unit used by SJE.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yup, that's what I was referring to.. those 80's OF1417s on SBS sv 171 and sv 24 back then. The 'roaring' sound that I meant was the low pitch loud engine sound when the bus slows down or braking. I'm sure some of the forummers here who grew up in the 80's are aware of that sound <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Yup, you got the description right abt the sound.<br><br>Erm..  What are exhaust brakes? Not sure la  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>The Scania u mentioned is Scania CRB? Or CRL? As for Hino, is it SMRT Hino Volgren? I didn't notice the exhaust brake sound of the 2 buses.<br><br>Thanks Mr Hseochin  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>
