            <div class='col-md body'>As mentioned by you, the HI's bodywork used on their MAN 18.250 has the last seat row raised the highest, unlike on the O 405 where the level is roughly same as the row before it. But i notice besides the different seat heights, the floor on the 18.250 is spilt-level with the higher level protruding ~ 1 m from the rear before quite a steep drop to the sloping floor below.<br><br>Therefore, upon further thoughts in view of the more updated info @ the MAN website on the 18.280 &amp; the above observations, i'll now put it that both the 18.280 &amp; 18.250 use a similar citybus chassi &amp; dashboard but with the 18.250 using the older 12-litre engine but vertically mounted instead of horizontally as on the O 405 &amp; SL 252.<br><br>My feedback on my earlier posts did not take notice of the high spilt-level floor near the extreme rear. If there's no such spilt-floor there then with only the raised last seat row, then maybe the engine used could be the smaller 7-litre instead with vertical mounting.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by hseochin:<br>Upon checking the engineering drawing @ their website, i notice they now use the same citybus dashboard which was used on the SL252 (similar as on O 405) on the 18.280 as well !<br><br>But i sense something's not quite 'right' in that they pass off the 18.280 shown in the website photo as 'chassis' only because the bodywork certainly does appear to me to be of 'sufficient' quality in design &amp; finish to pass off as original MAN citybus body instead !?! The 'themes' in the styling is certainly consistent with MAN integrally constructed CBU OEM bodywork which 'flows smoothly' from their bus to coach to truck product lines, i observe. Most unlikely therefore they should say it's 'chassi' only as such ? Maybe the body shown only used as 'model' for illustration purposes ?? As such i find it somewhat confusing because looking @ the complete bus purely on looks it would likely be though to be a SL252 or SL262 instead ?!?<br><br>In conclusion, i'll say that what's currently shown @ the MAN website is probably only their current product line-up for the Malaysian market i.e. they don't show the older models like those SL252 used by Intrakota &amp; these are the ones my 'engine perception' instincts (based on perceived levels of 'soildness' &amp; 'sound power') tells me that the 12-litre was ever used on their citybus model like the SL252 &amp; in view of the larger physical dimensions of a 12-litre (compared to say a much smaller 7-litre unit) it's most certain in the SL252 that the 12-litre engine was horizontally mounted like on O 405. If it's a coach body then maybe they'll consider vertical mounting as well in view of the lesser need to ensure a low floor level compared to in the case for a citybus body.<br><br>I note there's no 18.250 mentioned @ the MAN website, so that'll mean one can't be too sure yet that the engine on the 18.250 is vertically mounted ??<br>Why i don't think the engine is vertical is because in order for it to be vertically mounted onto a citybus body (with the emphasis on as low as possible as floor height) the engine would have to a 'small' cc engine (like 7-litre instead of a much bigger 12-litre unit) so that the longitudinal protrusion is not too 'long' that they need to raise the rear section of the body too high &amp; long. If the 18.250 uses the 7-litre engine then possible it's vertically mounted since the protrusion into the body is minimal. BUT having actually 'heard' the 18.250 on my rides taken, the sound characteristics simply tell me the engine used cannot be as small as 7-litre, which means to me the next larger known engine they use is the older noisier 12-litre unit, which for citybus body mounting would most certainly have to be horizontally mounted.<br><br>So, you could be right that the 18.250 has vertically mounted engine but i think the best way to be sure is to flip open the bonnet to find out...but for the reasons mentioned above, i'm still doubtful.<br><br>As for the MAN models used in HI's fleet, assuming they use only the current models available on CW2, i then expect it to be 18.313 instead of 18.280, as earlier though, unless MAN offers 2 versions of the 18.280 i.e. citybus &amp; coach versions ?? But if it's the 18.313 the engine doesn't sound like a MAN 12-litre engine to me, more like a 7-litre instead ?!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The picture of the bus on the 18.280 HOCLR page is actually an SL252 with HICOM bodywork. There was another page (closed) in the HICOM website which showcases the SL252 (with the same picture) and I remember it stated its engine capacity at roughly 7 litres with 250 hp. I'm pretty sure the 18.280 (on the webpage) and the 18.250 (HI's bus) is the same but with different engines only.<br>Suhirman "The Bus Guide"<br></div>

Different manifolds, components, engine management system, and muffler systems (to meet emissions standards) make it sound different.

            <div class='col-md body'>The engine block may be the same, which won't be surprising to me in view of the almost identical cc rating !<br><br>But, in the context of what you wrote, you said MAN uses OM 447 hLA in Euro-3 form on the MAN 18.250 ?? So that'll mean to me that OM 447 hLA (in it's 'standard' configuration or feature set etc.) is used in entirety on the MAN, which i sense cannot be too likely @ all. More likely M-B &amp; MAN may share the same engine block BUT the final feature set comprising of the hardware &amp; software aspects of the engine system &amp; peripheral device connections would tend to be different, to cater to the different design priorties &amp; preferences of each marque, thereby resulting in overall different engines from the packaging &amp; perhaps even marketing point of view.<br><br>The later versions of the O 405 (like those used by TransitLink &amp; SMRT-TIBS)<br>do sound different from the earlier versions used by SBST, with the exception perhaps of 1 unit (SBS 161) on SBST's fleet. The later versions of the O 405 G used here are expected to be Euro-2 complaint with charge-cooling i.e. OM 447 hLA, instead of the OM 447 hA &amp; OM 447 h among the [rigid] O 405 fleet in earlier versions here. Of course different exhaust perpheral fixtures can produce very different 'notes' from the engine ! Not only on buses, but also on trucks, cars &amp; motorcycles as well.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">hseochin,<br><br>It is the same engine!!!
