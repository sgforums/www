So that'll mean to me that OM 447 hLA (in it's 'standard' configuration or feature set etc.) is used in entirety on the MAN, which i sense cannot be too likely @ all. More likely M-B &amp; MAN may share the same engine block BUT the final feature set comprising of the hardware &amp; software aspects of the engine system &amp; peripheral device connections would tend to be different, to cater to the different design priorties &amp; preferences of each marque, thereby resulting in overall different engines from the packaging &amp; perhaps even marketing point of view.<br><br>The later versions of the O 405 (like those used by TransitLink &amp; SMRT-TIBS)<br>do sound different from the earlier versions used by SBST, with the exception perhaps of 1 unit (SBS 161) on SBST's fleet. The later versions of the O 405 G used here are expected to be Euro-2 complaint with charge-cooling i.e. OM 447 hLA, instead of the OM 447 hA &amp; OM 447 h among the [rigid] O 405 fleet in earlier versions here. Of course different exhaust perpheral fixtures can produce very different 'notes' from the engine ! Not only on buses, but also on trucks, cars &amp; motorcycles as well.<br><br></div></blockquote>SBS161 has the muffler system similar to the 3rd gen O.405s (ie SMRT O.405s and TransitLink O.405s).   The turbo versions of the O.405 sound like a quiet O.405G.  From 1998/99 all O.405s came standard with turbocharged engines (which leads me to believe that the vehicles which have Volgren bodies may have had the chassis stored for some time, because they are new in around 2000, and do not have a turbocharged engine).<br><br>As for the Euro III OM447hA, as I said, the block itself is standard OM447hA, but the MAN componentry and EMS are different, hence it does not sound like an O.405.  However, it has its own MAN designation (which I do not recall off the top of my head).</div>

The CW1 buses either Euro-1 or Euro-2 the most.<br><br>Also, when one says 'OM447hA', that refers to an M-B engine just as when one says 'D8766' etc. that refers to a MAN engine. To achieve Euro-3 level, OM447hLA is the more likely version than OM447hA only owing to charge-cooling used BUT my senses still tell me no Euro-3 for OM447hLA even since they have Euro-3 for OM457hLA, which i believe uses the same block as the 447's.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Windy_hates_B10TLs:</div><div class="quote_body">SBS161 has the muffler system similar to the 3rd gen O.405s (ie SMRT O.405s and TransitLink O.405s).

MAN is certainly not exactly 'cheap' when in the company of say Japanese/Korean/Russian marques. Being a quality German marque (2nd to M-B i'll consider) MAN prices therefore would not be as cheap as these others e.g.<br><br>MAN's popularity in Malaysia i'll attribute it to intensive marketing efforts there since from 10 years ago. Mercedes-Benz has always been &amp; remains popular there too, though in recent years due to the lack of newer models introduced there sales volume may have dropped somewhat as the M-B bus-chassi sold there mostly the older OH series &amp; only quite recently was the new O 500 models sold there &amp; now their popularity there is picking up due to encouraging response to their new generation models.<br><br>I don't find all Malaysian bus/coach operators to be the 'cheapskate' sort whereby only 'cheap' than they buy. Some are still like that but i notice quite a few others are nowadays willing to pay more for a quality marque (like the public bus &amp; many private coach operators in Singapore) so ensuring that the quality marques like MAN, Scania, M-B (even with their higher end V8 models) getting sales in Malaysia.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iveco:</div><div class="quote_body">So did I.

Then i'll say look into how they make the chassi in the 1st place. If they use a modular concept where they 'split' the chassi into say 5 modules or sub-sections (like what M-B does with their new O 500 models) they might be able to combine the required modules to make a non-standard articulated chassi for you ??<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by carbikebus:</div><div class="quote_body">Okie Thanks,Let's say if i'm a customer and i want to purchase a customised articulate Scania OmniLine buses(which they don't have)is it possible?</div></blockquote></div>
