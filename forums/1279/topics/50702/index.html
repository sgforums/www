            <div class='col-md body'>Well , it has been about 2 weeks since the opening of NEL .  The bus services load factor has dropped a little bit esp on routes that is directly competiting with the NEL like bus 85 . Despite the opening of the MRT ,  I must admit the load factor of 85 is doing not bad  and i think the SBST did the right thing by increasing the time waiting for the bus and perhaps send extras VO buses to other services .  How do you guys find the new routes those sbs services has been admended just  a day after NEL opening ?  Any need for more improvements ?
