            <div class='col-md body'>In all honesty, I think this topics of these nature would invite silly, ridiculous, irrational, illogical and unnecessary comments.  I don't see any purpose in even having such a poll.<br><br>Well, there's a possibility that the Volvo Mk4 will cameo on services like 22, 25, 55, 56, 70, 76, 133, 136...these buses currently operate DDs...hence they probably have the destos to use on the Volvo MK4 SDs...as for other svcs like 24, 53, 54, 57, 73, 130, 135, 138, 139, 145, 159 etc i dun tink they have the rectangular destos.  It would not be cost effective to make one rectulagar desto so that Volvo buses could cameo on the above mentioned services.  But I won't discount the idea totally that Volvo SDs cameos may appear on those svc w/o DD...can use the normal square one...but it would look weird of course.  I think the total no of Volvo SDs in AMDEP should be around 30 to 40.  And the MK4 DM3500 are fine on 162.  I don't see a need for them to leave unless some DDs can go onto 162.<br><br>I think HGDEP has rectangular destos for all its services..including 315 even though it has no perm MK4.</div>

But there is still a lot of NAC buses in Hougang Depot so maybe they have shortage of FAC to deploy so they use the NAC to replace it??? 82 actually can stop at Kovan Hub as not a lot of people go to Serangoon Int and most of the time empty. Some more there is 81 and 101 too go to Serangoon Int together, duplicating each other from Upp Serangoon Rd to the Int</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>talking bout sv82, and eventually 103, these 2 services has low ridership, and are victims of NEL rationalisation.<br><br>maybe you all may think why sengkang services, or sv158/ 100 dont get NAc.. becos.. well.. they may be "more respected". why else will 82 n 103 gets crappy mk2s while other HG depot services gets mk3 and above? (such as 371, 372, 317,315).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) There are far too many polls going around this forums now.  There are 2 to 4 polls going on right now.<br><br>2) Polls don't serve the purpose of constructive discussion.<br><br>3) What kind of purpose do such polls have?  There's absolutely no purpose in them.<br><br>4) Such polls would make this place a laughing stock of sorts (especially with some of the content written)...and it would cast bad light on the truly decent and sensible bus fans out there.<br><br>5) I replied in this particular poll because I think certain polls are getting ridiculous.  This poll is totally childish.  You are using this poll to express your opinion, wish and fantasy that the Volvo buses in AMK/BRAM be spread out or the unhappiness of seeing Mercedes buses on these services.  In other words, this poll is to pursue your own personal agenda nothing more.<br><br>6) I request that moderators shut this poll.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Airbus330Captain:</div><div class="quote_body">Thank you for your opinion but I am sure there are others that will disagree with you.
