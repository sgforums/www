              <p>9417Z used to be BN 65, but has been stuck in AMDEP for many years already..now AM 25 btw. <br><br>The thing is, West district depots (HGDEP / BBDEP / ARBP / SLBP) they usually swap buses among themselves, ditto for the East district depots (AMDEP/ BRBP / BNDEP). Very seldom in recent years have they did cross-district swaps..the last i remembered was 8242S which went over to AM 130 from HGDEP, that was a cross-district swap from West (HG) to East district (AMDEP). <br>The influx of Mk4 DM3500s &amp; Striders from BNDEP to BBDEP for the JB-cross-border fleet renewal years ago was another case, since they had the need to do so to replace the outgoing JB Mk3s. But other than those 2 cases, I don't remember any cross-district swaps lately..<br><br>It's not that the cross-district swaps won't happen, they do happen but in recent years it's very rare. Unless there is an urgent need for buses from other depots for a particular purpose (like Mk4s from all the diff depots to BBDEP for Sv 160 &amp; 170 fleet renewal), the East-district buses are more likely to stay in the East district depots no matter how they swap. <br><br>And looking at the still-significant amount of SP VO3xs BBDEP &amp; HGDEP still have now, and their amount of SP Wrights, I won't bet against more VO3xs from these 2 depots going over to SLBP. SLBP already laid-up quite a significant number of LO3xs &amp; VO2xs..so I guess they won't have any severe shortage of buses anytime soon given the number of SPs SLBP now have to go around. So I think the cross-district swap for LO3xs replacement might not happen..but within the West district itself, yes very likely unless they decide to let all the JIS go WAB suddenly with new Wrights.</p>

              <p>Yeah, it could do with more DDs in my opinion. Just hope that not all of them go to CGV only in the morning..the load to Serangoon is quite jialat in the morning at times. But that load for 109 varies depending on when the earlier Sv 53 Citaros &amp; Sv 81 KUBs arrive at Pasir Ris..that's why at times it seems like 109 no demand in AM Peak to Serangoon. </p>
              <p>8888D either met with an accident or something really serious happened. Totally MIA for nearly 2 months already...not sure if anyone saw it on cameo though.</p>

              <p>doing same slot consistently for this two weeks, driven by the same lady BC... although did not manage to find any perm sticker on driver cabin.. i think this slot belong to the 45A slot as well, as the timing match exactly for the downroute that start from lor ah soon at 0822am...  i think this is a fleet add and there are reshuffle of buses as well. From e-timetable, there seem to be 14 buses....</p>
              <p>today spotted 7400J  (with EDS showing off service) travelling along AMK Ave 5 towards AMDEP at around 9am . 7400J was just in front of 3136Z. and 7400J went via sv45 route and stop outside AMDEP and pick up one guy and then went off towards YCK road.. BC did not go into AMDEP and scan..  if 7400J is doing 9643L slot, then the timing should be much much earlier... so maybe 7400J brokedown earlier?</p>

              personally think 8812Y is still with sv45. I saw it last week doing
              its own slot in the evening ard 5 near Amk ave 10.</p>

              <p>doing same slot consistently for this two weeks, driven by the
              same lady BC... although did not manage to find any perm sticker on
              driver cabin.. i think this slot belong to the 45A slot as well, as
              the timing match exactly for the downroute that start from lor ah
              soon at 0822am...  i think this is a fleet add and there are
              reshuffle of buses as well. From e-timetable, there seem to be 14
              buses....</p>
              <p>today spotted 7400J  (with EDS showing off service)
              travelling along AMK Ave 5 towards AMDEP at around 9am . 7400J was
              just in front of 3136Z. and 7400J went via sv45 route and stop
              outside AMDEP and pick up one guy and then went off towards YCK
              road.. BC did not go into AMDEP and scan..  if 7400J is doing
              9643L slot, then the timing should be much much earlier... so maybe
              7400J brokedown earlier?</p>
