              <p>Look at AMDEP - Where are they going to dig the bendies from? The YI feeders badly needs them, The rest have 'just enough' for their own use, How do you expect the YI feeders to dig from other services (on weekdays), eg digging 975U from 854 to replace 1075K on 812? Then what bus is 854 going to use? </p>

              <p>It seems to me that the OVNP buses do have a fixed system in their deployment style. So don't assume that if any of the buses that went missing and got replaced by another bus doesn't mean it is perm, Unless that bus is seen cameoing around and never return back to its own service. So this would keep things easier.</p>
              <p>For AMDEP/GYBP 969's case, If TIB811J is missing (not there yet) and there is a fixed bus doing on 811J's block, Wait and see if it comes back after refurbishment. </p>
              <p>AMDEP/SEBP 882, It is obvious that TIB784D is down for refurbishment. And if 784D doesn't come back after it is refurbishment, Then we can consider 157S perm.</p>
              <p>So if 820H is down for refurbishment (not there yet) and there is a fixed bus, Wait and see if it comes back after refurbishment.</p>
              <p>AMDEP/YIBP 855: TIB814B- If the replacement bus is fixed, refer to my last line for the above 2.</p>
              <p>TIB795Y (KJ/BB 173) TIB797S (WL/BP 75) as above.</p>
              <p>Note for 811J 814B 820H it is not their turn yet, But just a note from observations.</p>
