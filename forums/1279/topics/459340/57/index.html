              <p>Why you say so that 8630E is perm already on 518? I have my
              doubts about that, not saying that it's not possible, so just want
              to verify when did you spot it exactly? Not spotted 8630E today,
              8316M on 518 instead. 8248B not on the usual timings I spotted on
              518 as well. 8316M was in PSR yesterday too. </p>
              <p>I would gladly appreciate it if people could post when they
              spotted a particular suspected permer on the service in question,
              instead of posting out of the blue that its perm somewhere. It only
              makes others doubt the reliability. Cheers.</p>
              <p>Like user '6305H' posts about spotting 8709M lately on 36, and
              the cameo lists by various people have also shown that 8641Z been
              running since June that period. But now you tell me 8630E is perm
              518 out of the blue? If you say it's on since last week, 8667A was
              on 518 too since last week yeah.</p>

              <p>Can confirm that 8709M is perm sv36. It did 36B a few times and I see it very often on sv36.</p>

              <p>Given that 2 cross-over, Service 53 operates at a 10 min
              frequency even SBS6010H is operating on Sv 53B and 6011E 6036J on
              410W. The 1st 6pm+ slot will always be 40 - 50+ pax when it departs
              Bishan Int, the bus operating on that slot is SBS6055D. The next
              will be SBS8164J, with 50 - 60+ pax, it will depart at 6:23 sharp.
              The next is 6:33, but will depart at approx 6:31 instead, which is
              6012C. That bus will hit over 70 pax and the loading will drop
              before NEX. At nex, only max of 10 people board the as there is a
              53B infront of it already. Btw, i observed the paxp during PM
               peak and even with citaros, it's still crazy for 410W. Before
              6035/6036 depart, a KUB will go, full house. 50 - 60 pax cannot
              board. Next, 6035 or 6036 will depart, becoming full house again,
              leaving 60 - 70 pax behind. After either 6035 or 6036 depart, the
              next 410W bus will be 6011E, 1 minute after 6035/6036 leave bishan

              <p>It's quite rare to see a Sv53 bus bunch up from PSR Dr 12 - CGA during PM peaks. If it's from CGA - Pasir Ris Drive 1, then it's common to see that. Not to mention during 9pm+ at PTB3 after the crossover, about 80 pax will be waiting at PTB3 53 berth. 6014Y will come first. The bus leaves with approx 60 pax, then 6035L will come. I know you're gonna say 'how come SBS6035L so fast can come to CGA?' The reason is that day is when 6036J does the crossover instead. Because 6035/6036 crossover to 410W in alternate days. Back to topic, after 6035L leaves fullhouse, alot of people will bunch up again. 2 minutes later, 8885L will arrive and zao with 70+ pax. Yea, you can say it's crazy. The 6012C slot@6:33pm is quite crazy yesterday. Full house and 20 people need to go down the bus.</p>

              <p>That's from Bishan Int right? Just checking in case I got lost
              in the amount of words, paiseh. From CGA, even with the supposed
              10-min or less freq, it's still quite crazy onboard a Sv 53 Citaro.
              It's not that bad if they bunched (which occurs quite frequently
              during PM Peak at PSR-CGA area) or 2 KUBs come together, but if
              there's only 1 standalone Sv 53 bus coming, it's crazy to try get
              onboard. </p>
              <p>Btw, can you double-check if 5060U still does the AM Peak x-over
              to Sv 53 from 410? Or if any Sv 410 bus does 53 during PM Peak?
              Seen 5060U a couple of times in the evening on Sv 53, but not sure
              if it was just a full-day cameo on 53 for those days or a x-over
              from 410 to 53 just for PM peak.</p>

              <p>Btw, can you comfirm if the 55 x-over to 410W still exists? I've never seen any of the 55 perm buses x-over to 410W anymore.</p>

              <p>It's quite rare to see a Sv53 bus bunch up from PSR Dr 12 - CGA
              during PM peaks. If it's from CGA - Pasir Ris Drive 1, then it's
              common to see that. Not to mention during 9pm+ at PTB3 after the
              crossover, about 80 pax will be waiting at PTB3 53 berth. 6014Y
              will come first. The bus leaves with approx 60 pax, then 6035L will
              come. I know you're gonna say 'how come SBS6035L so fast can come
              to CGA?' The reason is that day is when 6036J does the crossover
              instead. Because 6035/6036 crossover to 410W in alternate days.
              Back to topic, after 6035L leaves fullhouse, alot of people will
              bunch up again. 2 minutes later, 8885L will arrive and zao with 70+
              pax. Yea, you can say it's crazy. The 6012C slot@6:33pm is quite
              crazy yesterday. Full house and 20 people need to go down the
              bus.</p>

              <p>Wait uh, I want to check the timings you spot for PM Peak from Dr 12 to CGA? Cause somehow when I take the Sv 53 from 5+pm, it's always bunched up. But usually its Citaro-KUB together. Means I'm not discounting the fact that the KUB BC probably lambat + Citaro BC floored. Very rare 2 Citaros together in that direction, although yeah from CGA to Bishan like you said, it happens like almost everytime.</p>

              <p>Yesterday 9637E did sv13 in the evening. Maybe on 70 for 1 trip earlier I think. Usually the buses at yck swap with another at the term in the evenings. There isnt a fixed deployment for 70M I've noticed.</p>
              <p>Like how I just saw 8869J on sv13 today. They dont do not more than 1 trip, because after that they might return to their perm service or rest for the day at the depot.</p>
