              thought - If the buses get stuck in the Causeway/cross border jam,
              the comfort/atmosphere in the bus when in the jam (known sometimes
              to last up to a long period of time) could determine if passengers
              will want to stay on the bus or walk to the checkpoint - and
              eventually ridership on the service.<br> <br> By deploying the latest MAN NL323F A22 to likely compliment (or
              replace) the Mercedes Benz OC500LEs, it's a pretty good
              move.</span></p>

              <p>Actually you can walk along the causeway I think...but that's for the past(Not sure about now). I've seen many gave up on queuing 170/160 and ended up walking from Wdl CIQ to JB CIQ. In the past, waiting for 170 can be long. </p>
              <p>There's also a gate there. But I don't think there would be anyone interested to walk in now, given the fact that 160/170/950 can reach the JB fast and the frequency is still acceptable(on average). </p>

              <p>Anyway, most of 950 passengers are really lazy. They aren't much carrying any heavy backpacks nor holding any "barangs", regardless towards JB or towards Wdl Int. Probably out of 10 people, only 2-4 people are carrying for most of the time.</p>

              <p>To be honest horh~ walking in to JB is seriously dangerous (: Tried walking in once last time, can see many people simply just cut across the road at JB Ckpt. Somemore, with all the Malaysian Trucks/Buses fuels, the air is simply "tak boleh tahan" one~ </p>

              <p>After attempting to take 950 from Malaysia back to SG and
              failing to do so, ending up on 170 instead, I can only say that 950
              is one seriously f*cked up service that is never there when you
              need it.</p>
              <p>Really what is the point of 950 when 160, 170 do a better job at
              clearing the crowd and then I can always take 911, 178 etc if I
              want to go to WRI?<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>The same story for NR6 and SBST 6N, after experiencing so much
              crappy service from the former that got even WORSE, I figured this
              was another hopeless service and I'll be happier taking cab if
              there's people splitting the cost, or taking 6N on festive
              seasons.</p>
              <p>How many complaints have there been on nightriders going wrong
              way?</p>
              <p>Go figure.</p>
              <p>Desmond Kwek was right in saying the entire management of SMRT
              either was non-existent or just f*cked up. And the attitude goes
              all the way down to the SLs.</p>
              <p>I took 854 a couple of weeks ago at night and despite people
              flagging for the bus at least 3 stops, the BC never bothered even
              to slow down and stop!</p>
              <p>Seriously wtf is wrong with this company?</p>

              <p>I second to that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I took 950 last year on the Saturday before Christmas. I was queuing up at Woodlands Checkpoint waiting for the bus to bring me to the Malaysian Customs. As it was very crowded, I only managed to get on the 3rd bus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From my berth, I can really see the difference in SBS Transit and SMRT in terms of their service standard. For 950, the wait can go up to 20 mins in between buses. There is just 1 SMRT staff manning the berth and his or her duty is to just take down the plate numbers of the buses that just pass by.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In contrast, SBS Transit is much more organised. They drive the bus into the berth and align the exit door to it. The Bus Captain then opens both the front and exit doors for passengers to board, unlike SMRT, where the Service Leader aligns the entrance door to the berth and there is only 1 door for passengers to board from. There are 3 SBS Transit staff stationed at the berth. 1 will take down the plate number of the buses that pass by, 1 will stand by the entrance door and the last one by the exit door. When the bus is packed to the brim, the two staff at the doors will hit the body of the bus, signalling to the bus driver to close the door and to move off. The whole boarding process took less than a minute. SMRT's took 3 mins or so, with the Service Leader shouting for passengers to move to the rear very rudely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously SMRT, wake up your idea! </p>

              eh...
              
              As far as I know, not many backpack travellers do take 950, as compared to 170... for some reason...
              
              In reality, most people would just walk out via WTCP to Woodlands Centre... not many ppl take 170 or 950 for 1 or 2 bus stop..
              
              I think many ppl can't even figure out how come 856 can be so crowded bet WRI &amp; WTCP bus stop in the evening... many ppl just decide to take 856, walk in and queue for whatever bus that's available...
              
              950 will fly stop at Marsiling, can forget abt flagging for 950...
