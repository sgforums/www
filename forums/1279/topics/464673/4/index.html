              <p>After attempting to take 950 from Malaysia back to SG and failing to do so, ending up on 170 instead, I can only say that 950 is one seriously f*cked up service that is never there when you need it.</p>
              <p>Really what is the point of 950 when 160, 170 do a better job at clearing the crowd and then I can always take 911, 178 etc if I want to go to WRI?<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>The same story for NR6 and SBST 6N, after experiencing so much crappy service from the former that got even WORSE, I figured this was another hopeless service and I'll be happier taking cab if there's people splitting the cost, or taking 6N on festive seasons.</p>
              <p>How many complaints have there been on nightriders going wrong way?</p>
              <p>Go figure.</p>
              <p>Desmond Kwek was right in saying the entire management of SMRT either was non-existent or just f*cked up. And the attitude goes all the way down to the SLs.</p>
              <p>I took 854 a couple of weeks ago at night and despite people flagging for the bus at least 3 stops, the BC never bothered even to slow down and stop!</p>
              <p>Seriously wtf is wrong with this company?</p>

              <p>data indicates that contrary to some speculation, SMRTB routes
              do not bleed as much as SBST in overall terms.</p>
              <p>which is curious. apparently SBST services do not earn as much
              in per bus distance (km) terms as we often imagined.</p>
              <p>It really is the cost in per bus terms that was staggering for
              SMRT, and I would think one major reason is really how SMRT BCs
              love to floor the pedal.</p>
              <p>Another source revealed that educating Chinese truck drivers in
              Guangzhou on fuel efficiency tactics (ie not flooring the pedal
              unnecessarily) saved companies as much as 30% in fuel cost.</p>

              <p>After attempting to take 950 from Malaysia back to SG and
              failing to do so, ending up on 170 instead, I can only say that 950
              is one seriously f*cked up service that is never there when you
              need it.</p>
              <p>Really what is the point of 950 when 160, 170 do a better job at
              clearing the crowd and then I can always take 911, 178 etc if I
              want to go to WRI?<img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>The same story for NR6 and SBST 6N, after experiencing so much
              crappy service from the former that got even WORSE, I figured this
              was another hopeless service and I'll be happier taking cab if
              there's people splitting the cost, or taking 6N on festive
              seasons.</p>
              <p>How many complaints have there been on nightriders going wrong
              way?</p>
              <p>Go figure.</p>
              <p>Desmond Kwek was right in saying the entire management of SMRT
              either was non-existent or just f*cked up. And the attitude goes
              all the way down to the SLs.</p>
              <p>I took 854 a couple of weeks ago at night and despite people
              flagging for the bus at least 3 stops, the BC never bothered even
              to slow down and stop!</p>
              <p>Seriously wtf is wrong with this company?</p>

              <p>as above, people are really very lazy to walk out to the WTCP bus stop... but i still find 950's frequency more consistent than 160/170. outbound at WDL checkpoint, normally 1 950 = 4 160/170(X). </p>
              <p>IMO i rather stand on 950 then on 160/170. those DM3500 ceiling is low and it feels extremely cramped, and the boarding is very messy.</p>

              <p>maybe they should make use of the u-turn in JB. Dont need renumber as 950A. I see some 170 buses u-turn at JB CIQ.</p>

              <p>then is it the refurbishment of older buses + overhaul and
              maintenance that causes SMRTB to bleed more money in total more

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">SBST did far more refurbishment than SMRT in fact.</span></p>
              <p>Even if SBST did not do as complete a refurbishment back in the recent years for their Volvos, they have far more buses to re-seat, put some nice new AC fabric covers etc.</p>
              <p>Not to mention that there are less visible overhauls. Compare the engines of SBST buses against SMRT ones and I would hazard a guess that it is not only because SBST mainteinance seems more consistent but the engines and gearboxes are overhauled more often. Nobody has yet to dig up NEL's mainteinance schedule against EWL and NSL, but the latter 2 have been cited as sorely lacking in crucial mainteinance.</p>
              <p>No matter how they did so much nice refurbishment on the L113s, the fact remained that the bus engine sounded horrible and smoke was actually entering the bus interior. And I was referring to my ride on 673, supposed to be part of the newest batch of L113s. </p>
              <p>I used to think the B10Ms had pretty horrible grinding sounds when they moved and the gearbox gear clanging and meshing were very terrible.</p>
              <p>Then to my dismay the SMRT 0405s have so much more of these problems now.</p>

              you sure or not..
              
              once it reaches the viaduct, the lorry would turn in... left only 2 lanes for bus &amp; cars to use together...
              
              it's only SG bound that ICA can open up the right lane of JB bound into SG bound for lorry [weekday, sat] and buses to use...
              
              so 2 lane to JB, 4 lanes to SG...
