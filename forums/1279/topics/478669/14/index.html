              <p>Could be both party.... Theory is theory, and my theory goes:</p>
              <p>First thing first, driver might have confirmed old man not crossing right before the yellow box, so while checking on the right mirror, old man thought bus would stop before yellow box thus crossed... Both could be at the wrong judgement at the same time and ended up no one see the old man crossing and BAM!!! <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Even the passengers also dunno what the bus hit until BC and pax got down the bus and saw the gruesome scene... </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">34km/h would have been taken from the telematic device since they go for an accurate speed ending with a "4" instead of rounding up to 40km/h or 35 km/h when no one knows the exact speed, but telematic tells the controller the actual speed...</span></p>

              <p>Ended up being hit in the middle of the windscreen means BC totally didn't see him coming when her sight had likely been diverted to something, say checking of mirrors which drivers should normally do before and after pulling out from the bus stop...</p>
              <p>With the speed of 34km/h after pulling out of the busstop, the bus was certaingly still accelerating without anyone catching the attention of the old man crossing... If this is true, it can thus be the case of his body behind the bus...</p>
              <p>Also, taken into consideration that the old man was crossing with his walkingstick, means he can only cross at slow speed which high chances are he would have thought the bus would stop before the yellow box, but as the driver sight was diverted to something else, bus was coming straight at him, he had not enough time to get back to the kerb, which would imply how the crash happened right in the middle of the windscreen...</p>
              <p>If we were to visualise from the back of the old man corssing with the walking stick, was he crossing in a 90 degree angle perpendicular to the road surface or was he crossing in an actue angle perpendicular to the road surface? <br>Because in an acute angle against the windscreen + the speed of the bus, the victim suffers more impact than at 90 degree...</p>

              <p>Ended up being hit in the middle of the windscreen means BC
                              totally didn't see him coming when her sight had likely been
                              diverted to something, say checking of mirrors which drivers should
                              normally do before and after pulling out from the bus stop...</p>
              <p>With the speed of 34km/h after pulling out of the busstop, the
                              bus was certaingly still accelerating without anyone catching the
                              attention of the old man crossing... If this is true, it can thus
                              be the case of his body behind the bus...</p>
              <p>Also, taken into consideration that the old man was crossing
                              with his walkingstick, means he can only cross at slow speed which
                              high chances are he would have thought the bus would stop before
                              the yellow box, but as the driver sight was diverted to something
                              else, bus was coming straight at him, he had not enough time to get
                              back to the kerb, which would imply how the crash happened right in
                              the middle of the windscreen...</p>
              <p>If we were to visualise from the back of the old man corssing
                              with the walking stick, was he crossing in a 90 degree angle
                              perpendicular to the road surface or was he crossing in an actue
                              angle perpendicular to the road surface?<br> Because in an acute angle against the windscreen + the speed of the
                              bus, the victim suffers more impact than at 90 degree...</p>

              <p>Yes, I was going to point out this. It was a head-on collision, not a sideswipe. To be hit the the middle of the windscreen with such impact, it will be very difficult for the driver to absolve herself of any blame (especially if she claimed she did not see the old man) and get off the hook even if the old man was also negligent.</p>
              <p>Compare that to the position and magnitude of damage to the windscreen of the SBS Transit bus at the Bendemeer Road fatal accident.</p>
              <p>I was not expecting SMRT Buses to put their telemetrics system to full use so quickly, but this is going to prove immensely useful in their investigation.</p>
