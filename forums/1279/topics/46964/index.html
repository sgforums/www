            <div class='col-md body'>I hope SBST can operate a daily service to East Coast Park. Even if they do not operate on normal days, they should operate one service (e.g. svc 401) daily during school holidays (June and December) as many people (esp students) will go there to enjoy themselves.

What u guys think?</div></blockquote>In my opinion, it is not possible. Currently, service 401 operates only on Sundays and Public Holidays at a frequency of 30 to 40 minutes, which means the load and demand are low. There will be losses if the company let service 401 operates on other days. The only most possible to happen is to let the service operates on Saturdays too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah , I agree that there is no need of 401 service in weekdays because for people who wants to go to ECP on weekdays they can drop at parkway or any part of marine parade and walk using the underpass .</div>

But in the Marine Parade housing estate, the signs are just beside the underpass, which made it difficult for people to locate them.<br><br>One hour frequency? That's too long.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my suggestion.<br><br>If SBST thinks that operating a full-sized bus is a loss-making for them, why not introducing a fleet of small 20-seater buses (eg Toyota Rosa) for this service only. I don't think it will be loss-making if they utilise these vehicles for Svc 401. To break even, maybe they can charge a flat fare of $1.<br><br>Another area under-served by public transport is the Pusara Abadi at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery off Lim Chu Kang Road. Many people, and I emphasize <strong>MANY</strong> people I came across at the cemetery complained about the lack of a bus service serving that area. (I'm talking about the new Muslim Cemetery north of the Chinese Cemetery) Although passengers can take Service 405, the service only operates on certain days. And the nearest available service is svc 175, which is a good 1 km walk from the nearest stop. SBST or TIBS can start a shuttle service to this area, using the same 20-seater buses by charging a flat fare of $1. I can guarantee there will be people using this much-needed service. Most of the passengers want this service to serve on weekends.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards,</div>
