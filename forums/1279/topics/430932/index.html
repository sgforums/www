              <h1 class="storyheadline">MP Lim Biow Chuan exposes bus standards online
              							
              			<br><br></h1>
              <p>FACEBOOK is fast becoming the direct platform for Singapore 
              politicians to broadcast their messages directly. More so, after the 
              recent General Election.</p>
              <p>And the efforts from the politicians themselves and the interest from netizens shows no signs of abating.</p>
              <p>As traditional media often comes with space constraints in 
              newspapers, or time constraints on television or radio, the social 
              nature of Facebook has allowed more awareness of issues at the ground 
              level to be shared with the public, especially if they may not be big 
              enough to overshadow other competing news.</p>
              <p>Member of Parliament (MP) for Mountbatten - Lim Biow Chuan -
               did his own spot checks on the ground after complaints about the 
              regularity of some bus services during the election campaign period.</p>
              <p>He posted this on May 16 on his Facebook page at 4.48pm 
              then: 'I received complaints about the regularity of some bus services 
              during the campaign period. This morning, I waited at the bus stop from 
              8am to 9am with LTA (Land Transport Authority) officer to do an audit 
              and was horrified at the result. Will be writing to PTC (Public 
              Transport Council) and LTA to lodge a formal complaint about the service
               standards of the bus services.'</p>
              <p>On Thursday at 2.30pm, he posted this next update on his 
              investigations: 'Was at bus stop next to Block 56 Cassia Crescent this 
              morning for 2nd informal audit. Results are slightly better although 
              there is room for improvement. For service 70, a total of 8 buses came 
              within a period of 50 mins. Service 197 need to improve. Will feedback 
              to PTC for their follow up with SBS. Then monitor to see whether there 
              are improvements.'</p>
              <p>Earlier in the week, MP for Sembawang GRC (Admiralty) - 
              Vikram Nair - posted a YouTube video of himself drinking tap water 
              during a house visit to prove that the water in Blk 686B Woodlands Drive
               73 is safe for consumption.</p>
              <p>This was to reassure residents' concerns after the body of a
               dead domestic worker was earlier found in the block's water tank on May
               16.</p>
              <p><strong>Reactions from Facebook users on MP Lim Biow Chuan's page:</strong></p>
              <p>'Sir really appreciate your ground work. You didn't allow the LTA officer or your grassroots smoke you.' - <strong>Ong Delion</strong></p>
              <p>'Glad you came down to see things first hand! Great job, sir!' - <strong>Brenda Chia</strong></p>
              <p>'Mr Lim, thank you for your personal investigation. Service 
              158 is a good example. I am seeing a very positive commitment to improve
               the issues. If I can add, Facebook can be a good channel not to get a 
              watered-down feedback. Of course some posting are not constructive, 
              however like a Malay saying goes, if there's no wind the leaves will not
               ruffle.' - <strong>Jumali Sayuti</strong></p>
              <p>'Dear Sir, fyi, there are many other services which you will
               'be horrified' with. Nothing beats seeing it for yrselves isn't it???? 
              Really thumbs up for such efforts taken. Maybe you can consider checking
               out just how crowded our trains are also, especially the peak period.' -
               <strong>Jennifer Lee</strong></p>
              <p>'Good job. It's nice that you communicate what you are 
              doing. Do continue. Hope you won't get the brush off from PTC/LTA. Hope 
              they won't offer the traditional solution of tweaking the routes and 
              increasing services as the solution will only...be stop-gap measures 
              that do not address the root of the problem... and please tell them you 
              won't accept them to put up more ERP gantries in your area just to 
              'solve' the problem.' - <strong>Serene Chew</strong></p>

              <p>I myself wrote suggestions onto the bus and MRT services. I myself know esp over the MRT, it takes 2 yrs to procure any MRT train which ought to have been done earlier.</p>
              <p>If you complain abt MPs off the ground, then have you bothered to write anything abt it yet?</p>
              <p>I feel for it because everyone is going to school to work at the same time. It isn't just YOU ALONE going to work at tat point of time.</p>

              <p>He's a MP of mountbatten. His interest to taking care of the interests of his residents in the area. Its naturally alright for him to just sit at the bus stop and feel what his residents is feeling waiting for the bus to come, issnt it? Why would u want him to go up the train and buses, because thats the job of lta, ptc and the transport minister!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If writing to the authority help to solve your problem, you should see the new MRT and bus now and service improvement, but, are they anywhere to be to be seen ?</p>
              <p>My point on he getting on the bus is experience the squeeze and talk to the commuters if he really want to know what is the problem.</p>
              <p>Since he is doing a spot check, why not find out more to solve more issues ?</p>

              <p>SBST has improved their services alot as compared to SMRT. They had introduced DDs to 95, and there are short trip services to 200 and 95 during morning peak hours. On the other hand, SMRT frequencies to 970 was terrible, despite being the only bus service that linked Commowealth MRT and Holland Road. Moreover we now seeing more non-bendies plying on SMRT106. Seeing those DDs plying on SBST174, 7 would only make me fumes.</p>
