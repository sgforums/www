For six fortnights, 30 $100 AKIRA product vouchers will also be given to commuters who have accumulated the highest Transit Points every fortnight. In addition, a bonus prize worth $2,000 from AKIRA will be given to the commuter who accumulates the highest Transit points over the entire promotion period.<br><br>Mr Woon Chio Chong, Executive Vice President (Bus Operations) said, Â“We hope this initiative will encourage even more people to use our service 160 and 170 to Johor Bahru. We are happy also to be able to partner AKIRA for this promotion.

            <div class='col-md body'>What's the chances of winning any prize ?<br>I see this promotion as SBS becoming 'uncomfortable' with the quite direct competition with Handal Indah &amp; SJE that they have to resort to such tactics to try to sustain customers !<br><br>Which isn't surprising to me since among these 3 operators, the SBS 160 &amp; 170 uses the oldest &amp; lousiest buses in the entire fleet assigned to these routes !!<br>To win their prize one has to put up with the relatively inferior uncomfortable rides in these junky Volvo B10M's with junky Alexander or Duple Metsec bodies,<br>what for ?!<br><br>Instead i'll most gladly pay $ 2.4 &amp; go for the 'utimate class' travel experience<br>among Singapore public transport vehicles in the Mercedes-Benz OH 1627 L via SJE ! In properly maintained &amp; specified form, this twin exhaust pipe V8 bus-chassis is simply top of the class as far as passenger comfort is concerned ! As smooth &amp; slient as riding the E 220 taxi even when crusing approx. 100 Km/h<br>in top gear with air-con compressor OFF ! After having taken this model, all the other currently locally available M-B, Volvo, MAN, Scanias etc. become 'insignificant' !<br><br>What i hope SBS should offer instead (of such contests) is to upgrade their fleet of buses serving these routes to better &amp; newer ones instead !<br>I don't think people in JB would be jealous &amp; want to steal or damage your better buses if its deployed there as JB nowadays isn't all that backward anymore ! I was pleasantly surprised to note Handal Indah uses brand new Mercedes-Benz (suspect is IBC 1725) chassi serving routes within JB ! TransitLink there also have been using M-B O 405 (more advanced charge-cooled version which are also newer than most in the SBS M-B fleet) for several years already !<br><br>As long as SBS continues to deploy these junky Volvo's in the 160 &amp; 170 routes, that's good reason for me to avoid patronising them, especially for roughly the same fares, one gets to travel in superior class of buses from the other 2 operators !!</div>
