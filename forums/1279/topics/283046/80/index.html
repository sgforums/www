But this is what I suspect.<br><br>9012H and 9015A should do E shift, since in the past 7236S and 7238L did E shift. For some reason, SLBP still allocates the 2 255 x-overs as the lowest 2 regoes in the fleet.<br>The next 3 regoes - 9016Y, 9021G, 9031C should do A/P shift.<br><br>The other buses on S shift should all be 6 LO3x + 9363U &amp; 9365P. All these 8 S shift buses should do x-over to 242.<br><br>If 9363U and 9365P hasn't come into the picture yet and all 8 S shifts are now LO3x, about 2 weeks later, 2 LO3x will be replaced by 9363U and 9365P. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

For some reason, SLBP still allocates the 2 255 x-overs as the lowest 2 regoes in the fleet.<br>The next 3 regoes - 9016Y, 9021G, 9031C should do A/P shift.<br><br>The other buses on S shift should all be 6 LO3x + 9363U &amp; 9365P. All these 8 S shift buses should do x-over to 242.<br><br>If 9363U and 9365P hasn't come into the picture yet and all 8 S shifts are now LO3x, about 2 weeks later, 2 LO3x will be replaced by 9363U and 9365P. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote> 9031C on 143 today...</div>
