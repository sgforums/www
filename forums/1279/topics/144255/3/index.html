What u are trying to imply...since A has intro 4 new svc therefore B should also intro new svc too...wat kinda logic is this...u can't intro new svc just for the sake of introducing...they have to consider their resources and whether there's a demand for the route...subsequently...their plans have to be approved by the LTA...<br><br>Next time remember, do not include the names of the other parties when u post any reply u get online.  And do yourself and the companies a favour...stop sending this kinda funny requests/questions to bus companies.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by muziq bus:</div><div class="quote_body">ok, i dunno where to put this...<br>so i juz put here....no war please<br><br>i enquired on whether SMRT will introduce new services... i told dem sbst intro 4 services diz month and i asked whether yew tee n bt panjang will get new svc...this is da reply...<br><br>Thank you for your email.<br><br>We wish to assure you that we have been monitoring the service requirements of our commuters in the towns that we serve.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't deny that my comments may stir controversy or unhappiness from people like you muziq bus as well as others.  If you wish you argue over what I've said, I have nothing to say.  What I speak is the truth.  It's really harmless.  It escalates into an argument when you try to defend your actions.<br><br>I understand that Bukit Panjang and Yew Tee may not have enough bus services.  However, bus companies also need to consider whether they have enough resources to introduce new buses, whether there's ridership and a market for that new service.  They will need to go through the LTA for approval too.  It is not a race between bus companies to see who introduce more new bus services.<br><br>By the way, telling Company A about what Company B is doing when Company A is aware of is pretty extra on your part.  Come on, what is that you wish to achieve?  If you think is the way of pressurising them to introduce new bus services, that is so childish.  Sending this kind of mails would irritate them, because there's nothing constructive in them.  It's as good as this - Since A is doing this, there you must do this.  Why don't I see you doing that.  As I said above, it's not about competing to see who introduce more bus services.  To be more constructive, why don't you suggest to them where to introduce new routes to.  Or if you wish, you can take to task with the MPs of the respective new towns into talking to bus company.<br><br>Why don't you go reflect on what I've said and see if it makes some sense, and see if you can be more constructive next time?<br><br>And yes, it's not very nice to put the person's name and exact title from the response in the public.
