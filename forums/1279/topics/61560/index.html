But see it from another point of view. The diversion is inevitable, as we know that it is to facilitate the construction of the new CIQ Building/Causeway Bridge.<br><br>We would think that the JB authorities would just ask SBST to divert its Service 170 via the coastal road and Jalan Lingkaran Dalam before terminating at Larkin. But instead, it allowed SBST to terminate Service 170 at 2 locations; Larkin Terminal &amp; Kota Raya Terminal.<br><br>To me, that is a nice 'gesture' by the JB authorities. If they would do it in a 'harsh' way, they would just ask SBST to divert Service 170 without allowing it to have any stops along the way or another terminating point, so passengers could take CW1 instead.<br><br>Cheers and warm regards</div>

Couldn't blame them though as the buses will wait to be full before moving off, hence maximizing revenue. One thing I like about Causeway Link is that they provide coin exchange at Kranji. A good move to swing passengers their way. People tend to board the first bus they see and there is always a CW1 bus waiting at Kranji.<br><br>Handal Indah have already prepared for the express service, CW2. There is already a berth for it at Larkin and Kota Raya while the buses are ready to be deployed. I think it is still waiting for the Singapore authorities to give the go ahead.<br><br></div>
