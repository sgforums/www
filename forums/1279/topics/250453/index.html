Which profit oriented industry don't want to make a neat pile of bonus. Including hospitals and public transport industries. Public Transport industry is the only I have seen whereby the govenment even comes in to control the profits. It is like putting a ceiling to the growth of a child rendering it unable to grow healthily. I recall receiving an email from Ong BL before saying about half the income of the company goes to the salaries of the company. Taking note that the rest goes to the operating costs which are not cheap. Fuel alone is enough to exhaust. The best up to date pathetic 2.5 months bonus aka 71days (which only top 10% can get) is often unknown to the public. I went for other interviews and there was even one wealthy company laughed at the pathetic 2.5mths. I realised thats the best you can go after decades in the market?<br><br>SMRT also part of the industry will not be able to escape this problem. And it's a great thing that they are still reaping profits. When you're in a business, income will be the priority. You need to balance the service &amp; income. If the service is greatly enhanced with the efforts put in, will there be an increase in income? Sad to say, no matter how much people deny, this is the way of the business. And the day will come for many of you to understand when you start working in the management level of a company.</div>
