            <div class='col-md body'>1. I think we are better off if our bus svcs are nationalised. Aft all, we are too small to have any more competitions (SMRT looks bad in the bus fights.). And please do not compare Spore with HK, the guy said dun know got 3 or 4 companies.<br><br>2. Well, I do not think the mkIIIs are slow, if they want to be fast, true, though, they are sluggish. Neither are they stuffy as their aircons have been refitted. Though they are musty and dull inside. In fact I find the body quite attractive as opposed to the forehead of the mkIV striders. Anti-mkIII people, dun kill me, I am just expressing my views.....</div>

The City area buses are at a frequency of 1-7 mins but off areas are at 40-45 mins. Anyway, HK has 2 times more ppl than us. In fact, the bus fares are ex, he is just trying to critiscise our bus svs... From Kwloon to HK cost S$4.50 when lunch cost abt S$6.00. You can take 2 bus rides for 1 lunch meal here, so what logic is there?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. I think the public transport scene in Singapore is stabilising. The system was already working fine. 2 bus operators and 1 train operator is enough. But they want competition and we saw a second train operator. Things got a bit awry. In the end, we lost TIBS, which was incorporated by SMRT, to strike a balance and return to having 2 main operators.<br><br>2. The B10M MkIII are sluggish off the mark due to its Voith gearbox. With a Voith gearbox, the B10M will generally rev up to 1500 rpm, hold it there for a second before shifting into the next gear. Since the engine cap is only 9.6L, this will take a while compared to, say a Scania N113. A ZF, by comparison, shifts at 1200 rpm. However, by the time it reaches the final gear, a Voith will have a higher speed than a ZF. In general, Voiths are more suitable for open roads while ZF are more suitable for stop-go operations.<br><br>I agree that how fast a bus goes relies on the driver and his schedule. If they're behind time they'll drive like crazy. If they're ahead, they'll cruise leisurely.</div>
