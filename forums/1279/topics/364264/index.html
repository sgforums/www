              <p>I m just psst with some foreigners, yesterday I was in the bus 857 with my wife from Suntec.</p>
              <p>A group of foreigners from India, i think they were from the PC show about 5 of them,males, were in the bus, talking loudly and behaving like monkeys in heat-i think thats quite tolerable for me and others in the bus but the worse part is that they were blocking the bus exit and the back of the bus were some space where they can move and they were not automatic also blocking people from moving to the back, even when some girls and aunties getting down the bus, they didnt give them space making them squeezed their way down the bus.</p>
              <p>when my turn came to alight, my wife told them to excuse but they ignored (if I m alone, I like any other male will push thru my way). then i told them nicely that theres space at the back to move and dont block the way.</p>
              <p>but they argued back at me as if they were in the right to stay put, I was psst and told them its a common sense and stop acting like an idiot to block people.</p>
              <p>well, I was talking to monkeys and I felt like wacking them but of course I was in control, so I offered them to come down with me so that I can teach them a lesson, at the point I was ready to give them a good beating, although its 5monkeys vs me alone. anyway they didnt take my offer.</p>
              <p>I had seen several times that these type of foreigners who just indirectly bullying young shy girls on the bus by not giving them way and even try to have some cheap thrills contact, in previous times I had taught some of them some lessons, so if any of you people who reading this wanna be the monkeys-beware!! me or Singaporeans will not hesitate to teach you. please dont make us like another australian violence on indian students.</p>
              <p>(sorry for any offensive words but I know not all indians or foreigners are like that)</p>
