            <div class='col-md body'>So the old old buses have those metal plates to the right of the entrance right? Then you also have those plastic put-from-inside types that came in, what? 95? 96.<br><br>Does anyone remember - in those days where SBS proclaimed their buses "AIRCON" in that blue sign, did that sign by the door also have the word "AIRCON" on it? Or was it only the service plate number on top of the bus that had that blue thing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember from my hazy memory (I was young then) that in the past, if it were a NAC bus, it will be white and green for the side desto. for the feeders that have green/white systems eg 231, the 231W will be completely white. just like what you see nowadays.<br><br>if it is a aircon bus, the top part is dark blue with the words printed in white. the bottom part color i cannot remember already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>at one point, sbs(t) (cant remember is it before or after the rebranding to sbst) changed all its plates to shades of red, even for the buses with the green/white system. they just paint a light red to signify the green plate.</div>
