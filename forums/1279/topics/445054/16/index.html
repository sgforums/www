              <p>Are you telling me that a bus in the bus park/depot sleeping can suddenly move itself and buang everything? Too fantasy minded la dey...no matter how sucky the situation is, how poorly the driving skills are, I'm trusting that the drivers will never let the bus automatically move on it's own.</p>
