              The worst thing being bus drivers some aren't good in defensive driving...
              
              1) Some examples... Bendy buses force their way to exit the Raffles Town Club bus stop even when traffic from Stevens Rd are proceeding... Traffic is so heavy, and worst thing being bendy buses... so long... ppl need to avoid knocking the rear end, can ppl brake in time...
              
              To the pt so daring, flash headlight on front SBST bus that didn't move off cos it was simply not safe... 
              
              SMRT... Never train bus driver how to keep safe... Love langa... 
              
              2) Road got puddle of water before the bus stop, still dun want to slow down... rely on the braking in spite of the big puddle of water... skid how?
              
              3) Driving 12m O405 or 17.5 O405G??? Filter lane until so tight on high speed PIE... Somemore that farking O405G speeding at 80km/hr... side swipe at this kind of speed???
              
              Dunno how to drive or train ppl w/ bendy bus, then dun buy MAN A24... simple as that...
              
              Raffles Town Club that bus stop sooner or later SMRT langa area.. anyhow force their way out...

              <p>CHANGING bus designs to create extra standing room may be more 
              effective than campaigns urging passengers to move to the back of the 
              vehicle, experts claim.</p>
              <p>Transport analysts said that by fixing design flaws in the current 
              fleets, passengers will be more willing to move further inside and make 
              room for others.</p>
              <p>It comes after the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that it would 
              put stickers in 550 buses over the next five years to tackle ungracious 
              behaviour.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>

              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              Dr Lee Der Horng, a transport researcher at 
              the National University of Singapore, said passengers tend to want to 
              stay near the exits, especially during peak hours.
              <p>Experts also suggested moving the exit door to the rear, putting all 
              seats at the front so the back only has standing room and using foldable
               seats to free up space.</p>
              <p>Transport economist Michael Li, of Nanyang Business School, estimated
               that by making some of the changes, the average journey can be cut by 
              at least 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Passengers told The Straits Times they are not willing to move to the
               back due to the narrow aisles and uncomfortable sloping floor. Most bus
               users said they usually move to the centre where there is more standing
               room.</p>
              <p>"The problem is not with commuters but with the bus design... there's
               not much space at the back and it's also inconvenient for those seated 
              at the back to come out," said human resources executive Joanne Soh, 42.</p>
              <p>Madam Joyce Chia, 51, said that even though she is willing, "I have 
              to squeeze through... They roll their eyes and do not budge."</p>
              <p>Bus operators SMRT and SBS Transit say their newer buses, with low floors, are catered to the elderly and wheelchair-bound.</p>
              <p>But one drawback is that the engine is located at the back, which 
              raises the floorboard at the rear. Also, said SBS Transit spokesman 
              Tammy Tan, exit doors cannot be placed at the back as steps would then 
              be required, which would present a problem for the growing number of 
              elderly passengers.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan said standing capacity in its buses is up from about 40 to 55,
               while single-decker buses added to the fleet last year are low- floor 
              with no steps in the aisle.</p>
              <p>SMRT also said standing room in its buses has increased, with its latest vehicles taking 52 standing passengers and 38 seated.</p>
              <p>The LTA began its sticker trial last Sunday, with four messages on 16
               buses on routes 50 and 513. One sticker reads: "You're such a darling! 
              Wiggle in a teensie weensie bit more, OK?"</p>
              <p>Public Transport Council chairman Gerard Ee said the stickers are a 
              good idea, but operators should consider new bus designs. "Every idea 
              can and should be explored, but there are always trade-offs. Do we 
              create more standing space at the expense of seats for increasingly 
              elderly passengers?"</p>
              <p>Dr Siok Tambyah, a marketing lecturer at NUS, said: "Campaigns will 
              have to go hand in hand with a design change to send a more effective 
              message."</p>
              <p>Said full-time national serviceman David Chen, 20: "Campaigns have 
              their benefits, but they are not as effective as having the bus driver 
              shout out."</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually horh, if the operators(SBST/SMRT) would to drill, "patience and check", this 2 words, into each and individual drivers' head, I believe the passengers would move back. </p>
              <p>What's the reason then? Drivers often tend to check, but miss out certain passengers alighting and often closed the door, creating a fear for the passengers whom failed to alight, and the driver simply move on to the next stop. Also, certain buses have bells that only sounded once before the door opens~ Unlike those Habits(an example), I've seen passengers spamming the bell chime to catch the attention of the drivers, if they failed to alight. </p>
              <p>Yes you might say people should press and move towards the door earlier, but not everyone is born to do that~~ SD still not bad, the worst case is from the DDs/Bendy. If the driver failed to check carefully, either the passengers would have to shout loudly or simply start spamming bells and shout together~ </p>

              <p>This article is contributed by the STOMP Team.</p>
              <p>A taekwondo coach from Korea has earned plaudits from Singaporeans and netizens alike for giving his slippers up to an elderly woman who was barefooted on a local bus during his visit to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Choi Dae Ho, a member of the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) Peace Corps had stooped down and offered the old lady his slippers, before bending down to put them on for her.</p>
              <p>A photo of the incident was taken by another WTF Peace Corps member and subsequently posted on the Singapore Taekwondo Federation website.
              According to the site, Dae Ho had been on a trip to Sentosa during his break from teaching the Singapore National Squad.</p>

              <p>Woah..why not blame BIS for teaching these kids badly? If they have behaved correctly, why or who will wanna stomp them(Even)? <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Go gather much reliable info before you start pin-pointing btw~~ These can be from one-sided story, and kids can make up stories, just like how BIS can make up a "long" story for just 1 stupid cameo.</p>

              <p>Firstly, do you think it's alright to chat with the driver? Plus, someone is sitting on the floor when there's seats beside. Isn't that creating a nuisance? Somemore why must you talk to the driver? Are your talking even those normal chit-chats or bus-related stuff? </p>
              <p>I don't even think the driver would want to start talking(starting a convo) if you never say anything(or reply her continuously)</p>

              <p>i'm very disgusted by you, putting screenshots of private conversations on public domain? did you just realise you violated other's privacy by putting up screenshots of private email convos without their permission? name-shaming in public domain?</p>
              <p>come on, talk lawyers and suing and now you're just digging a grave for yourself by doing this.</p>
