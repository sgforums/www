              <p>Firstly, do you think it's alright to chat with the driver?
              Plus, someone is sitting on the floor when there's seats beside.
              Isn't that creating a nuisance? Somemore why must you talk to the
              driver? Are your talking even those normal chit-chats or
              bus-related stuff? </p>
              <p>I don't even think the driver would want to start
              talking(starting a convo) if you never say anything(or reply her

              <p>You seriously another idiot whom simply loves to pin-point, no wonder the war don't stop because of the non-stop "shooting" to one another. Please lah..this is a HOBBY, not PARLIAMENT issues where there's opposition and propositions. Even there's a need for "Parliament" issue(s), there's no need to go beyond words and emocons. </p>
              <p>Anyway, it seems that many people are doing it nowadays? Don't forget what you are doing now can project to the next generations. It also makes me wonder what's there to talk about to drivers seriously...when there's google/yahoo/msn. Even the aunties nowaday are clever than us already, they know when is the right time to talk(to drivers) and when isn't.</p>
