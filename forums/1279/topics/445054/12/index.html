              <p>My kids? What my kids? Hahahahahahahaha</p>
              <p>Still trying to bring up an incident that happened a year ago... Dude what have you achieved in your life. You claim to be documenting singapore public transport history no one opposes to that but then I don't see how flame wars contribute any part to Singapore public transport history,</p>
              <p>and like I said, disrespect me and defame me all I want but you very well never think of bringing my own parents into this argument. No ones been talking about YOUR upbringing. No ones been talking about YOUR parents. And now you decide to bring my family into the argument then you talk about us being disrespectful.</p>
              <p>Disrespectful, yeah right, when you haven't had enough talking about us so called kids, you even try to criticise our own parents and family. I can accept criticism on myself, but you've not even seen any of my family before, and you go yelling your head off on public media on how my parents failed to bring me up; karma will bite back at you... Tell me more about what my family has done to you.</p>
              <p>i have been keeping my cool all this while trying to talk like how I'd talk to a 24 year old. I have the option to just lose it and spout vulgarities and hokkien body parts and all the nonsense. But oh pleeeeease, I'm not going to bring myself down to your level. I've heard too much about how people win arguments. Thank you very much and have a nice day,</p>
