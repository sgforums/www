              <p><strong>Jurong Region Line</strong></p>

                              <p>someone should really measure the gap between Pioneer Primary School and blk 863/864, using measuring tape, ultrasonic, or whatever other measurement method. As a former student of Pioneer Primary School and someone who has been in the area for around twenty years, I think there is space to build a pair of monorail viaduct there, while maintain a certain distance from the HDB flats.</p>
              <p>Well, if Jurong Region Line is a monorail line, there is very likely going to be another new line in the West, besides Cross Island Line, which could at least be medium capacity. I guess the so-called "Holland Line" will run all the way to Jurong West, since it's going to help relieve loading off East West Line.</p>
                              <p>Once again, I am writing here because I have been expelled from the skyscrapercity forum. If there is any SSC member reading this, I hope he can raise this point at that thread on Jurong Region Line. Thanks.</p>

                              <p>by the way, does pang soon tan happen to be someone at SSC? if so, maybe this explains... </p>
                          <p>that admin at SSC is so confident that Jurong Region Line is a MRT... low capacity MRT... and the people there just blindly follow him... if Jurong Region Line turns out to be a LRT, I really want to see the reaction at SSC... haha.</p>

              <p>Well, if Jurong Region Line is a monorail line, there is very

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Do note that Pioneer Secondary and Boon Lay Secondary will be merged from January 2017 and its location of merged school is </span><span style="line-height: 20.927px;">Boon Lay Secondary.</span></p>

              <p>So that means the primary school location most probably be moved to the former site of the secondary school, giving enough room for the line.</p>

                  no need to keep it confidential until they make official
                  announcement about it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, their plan of Jurong Innovation District at Bulim/Wenya
                  looks interesting. It looks like there will be some retail and
                  lifestyle hub coming up there. The possible Jurong Region Line
                  depot at Bulim/Wenya may be similar to Ten Mile Junction - only
                  bigger, duh.</p>

                                                          <p>Well, now that the Jurong Region Line has been "revealed" in the video of Jurong Innovation District, I guess they will announce the JRL alignment and stations soon. The announcement may be brought forward due to the by-election at Bukit Batok SMC.</p><p>While the Jurong Region Line alignment and stations are announced, they may also announce another new MRT line: the so-called "Holland Line". This "Holland Line" may serve Bukit Batok town, but it can interchange at either Bukit Batok station (Bukit Batok SMC and Hong Kah North SMC) or Bukit Gombak station (Hong Kah North SMC and Chua Chu Kang GRC). If Bukit Batok SMC wants the "Holland Line" at their doorstep, they know what to do.</p>

              <p>I am sorry, but I would like to clarify something.</p>
                  <p>In Sengkang/Punggol, the HDB flats are at least around 25 metres away from the LRT viaduct, and the schools are at least around 20 metres away. The LRT viaduct is around 5.4 metres (6m) wide. In all, there needs to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least 51 metres of gap</span> available to even build a viaduct for LRT trains.</p>
                  <p>the speculation is that Jurong Region Line is likely to use LRT viaduct and trains, with the capacity of a MRT.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Indeed,<strong> the gap between Pioneer Primary School building and blk 863/864 is not wide enough to accommodate even a viaduct for LRT trains</strong>. It is only 21 metres at narrowest.</p>
                  <p>but, even some of the buildings along Jurong West Street 82, 75 and 64 are less than 50 metres apart.</p>
                  <p>whatever the type of viaduct used, it is definitely smaller than the type used on Sengkang-Punggol LRT... I think even smaller than the ones used for sentosa express which are also around 5.4m (6m).</p>
                  <p>still got what other elevated viaduct that can build within 5m of space while considering privacy distance from flats and schools? hmm....</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>unless, the Jurong Region Line is underground.</p>
                  <p>however, the moderator y2koh, his friend circleline4 and his fellow friends at the other forum keep insisting that the line is elevated. I really wonder what viaduct option is available for spaces that are only up to 50 metres wide.</p>
                  <p>it would be good if someone can enlighten me on that. thanks. :)</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>if it is elevated, I can only imagine a LRT viaduct with privacy screens on both sides, throughout the section at Jurong West Street 82, 75 and 64. This may reduce the minimum distance required away from HDB flats and schools, and make it possible for LRT viaducts to be built along those roads.</p>
                  <p><img src="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/images/smilies/previous.gif" alt="" width="45" height="15"> This means there's very likely <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">no station</span></strong> along Jurong West Street 82, 75 and 64 (except at Boon Lay MRT Station)... which also means there maybe no "Gek Poh" station. :(</p>
