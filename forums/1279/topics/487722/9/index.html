              <p>obviously, yesterday's stunt was done against me, otherwise other threads would also be locked and have their "predecessor thread" renamed.</p>
                              
                          <p>It's also obvious that there is a group of participants here who has "insider's information", based on the posts and the timing of posts. (still say no gang...)</p>

              <p>obviously, yesterday's stunt was done against me, otherwise
                  other threads would also be locked and have their "predecessor
                  thread" renamed.</p>
              <p>It's also obvious that there is a group of participants here who
                  has "insider's information", based on the posts and the timing of
                  posts. (still say no gang...)</p>
              <p>I doubt the intention is really to not have so many threads, or
                  encourage all threads to have two thousand posts, but let's see
                  about it.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I do not know why I am black-listed here, when I only
                  participate in forums once in a while; I do not think it is fair to
                  me. It's sad that even some participants think that I am a troll,
                  or assume that I do not know anything.</p>

              <p>Hi mr gekpohboy, it is obvious you think too much. Just let nature take its own course and restrict your comments to only topics related to buses. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Anyway, if you were here since 2014, you would realise that three changes here were initiated by me, when I was "pervertedboy", "jurongresident" and "jurongwestresident" ("<a href="/forums/1279/topics/476842"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus contracts model</span></a>", "<a href="/forums/1279/topics/485752"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">press release</span></a>" and "<a href="/forums/1279/topics/487769"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bus interchange</span></a>"), before they were re-created by other participants.</p>
                      <p>I am happy to be able to encourage change in SGforums.</p>
                      <p>Really, I think I have stayed here long enough.</p>
                      <p>In the working world, everyone is encouraged to change company after two to three years, so that they can constantly upgrade themselves. (This is a common regret among the Seniors, who spend their entire adult life in one company.) Maybe it is time for me to leave.</p>
                      <p>Thank you SGforums (and Skyscrapercity and SGtrains) for the three years I spend here. I have gained many valuable knowledge about buses and trains.
