If charged and convicted of drink driving, he could be fined between $1,000 and $5,000, or jailed six months and banned from driving for at least a year.<br><br>SBS Transit spokesperson Tammy Tan said the company is "appalled" by the incident and added: "We take a very serious view of this and have decided to sack the bus captain as a warning to other bus captains."<br><br>SBS Transit currently operates 2,800 of the 3,500 public buses here.<br><br>The damaged lamp-post was later replaced.<br><br>In the first quarter of this year, 920 people were arrested for drink-driving, 22 per cent more than the same period last year.<br><br>In the high profile drink-driving case involving actor Christopher Lee, who was released from jail recently, High Court Judge Lee Seiu Kin called drink driving a "social menace".<br><br>Justice Lee said he wanted to send a "sobering chill down the spines" of potential drink drivers last month when he extended Lee's original jail term of a month by another two weeks. He also said the tendency of the courts to merely impose fines for first-time offenders ought to stop. - TODAY</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bus: <strong>SBS 3619Y</strong> (No aircon on this bus)<br>Service: 292 (Cameo)<br>Date: 13 July 2007<br>Time: 1350hrs at time of witness<br>Location: Tampines Avenue 5<br>Summary of accident/breakdown: Engine overheat<br>Details:<br>1. SBS 3619Y was cameoing on feeder service 292. Before the bus could move off after the traffic light at the cross junction (Tampines Avenue 4 and 5), the engine died. All passengers, including the BC, alighted from the bus.<br>2. The back engine cover was open. While I was on another bus at 1400hrs, the BC was seen wrestling over the engine, possibly trying to ward off the heat and smoke from the engine.<br>3. As the bus stopped right at the left side of the road, drivers driving on the left side of the road had to divert to another lane. Traffic came to a crawl, but not very serious.<br>4. SBS 3618A was suspected to have replaced SBS 3619Y.</div>
