By the way, the road up ahead (at the junction of Millenia Insitiute) one GT plate pick up overturned around 1800hrs when I passed by on service 174, SBS227P. Police was on scene. Maybe the bus got diverted because of that, end up U turning but cannot get out. Buses always seem to meet such problems.<br>And SBS2704R (SL 66) broke down outside BB Int, spotted around 1810hrs, BC playing with HP at bus stop.</div>
