            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is very hard to comment on threads like this. Firstly, there is no proper or correct info to make the judgement on which service is profitable. Secondly, since the judgement is based mainly on personal opinion, it is completely biased with no backup of evidence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its very hard to quantify these kind of things. some svcs may have super high demand during certain times of the day; at other times it may be very low. besides, how does one justify profitable? costs incurred include the driver's salary, diesel, maintenance cost, cost of other stuff eg paper for tickets, bus guides,cost of handling and dealing with coins, depreciation costs etc etc. more ppl taking the bus does not equal profitable, take svc 74 for example. many ppl? yes. but many of them are using concession passes, whch are subsidized by other full paying commuters. no offence intended, but i think the word "profitable" is not quite appropriate; maybe "highest demand/passenger loads" may be more suitable.</div>
