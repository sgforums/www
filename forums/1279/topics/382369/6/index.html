              <p>So far, I have not been questioned, but I'm sure my day will come soon.</p>
              <p>But I rarely take photos of buses. However, my experience in taking bus photos has its ups and downs.</p>
              <p>After I snap a picture, I tend to thank the BC by raising my right hand up, to acknowledge him that I'm taking a pic of him. In some cases, they tend to stop at the Bus Stop for quite a while for me to take a nice picture. Of cause, I appreciate his kindness by waving to him again. Some BC also tend to pose for the picture. I remember a few months back, this friendly Chinese BC, pose for me so that I could take a picture. He's a nice guy. </p>
              <p>However, I got some stares from some BC when I take a photo of the bus. Some would ignore me, but some we continue to stare at me. But never have I been questioned by BC onto why I was taking a picture of the bus.</p>
              <p>I know, it will come soon..(the questioning)</p>

              <p><br>OT...but subs call on us also. Most often its the LA class, but I've seen the Virginia class one at least once.</p>
              <p>Sadly never seen a Ohio one before, that's supposedly another monster as far as subs are concerned.</p>
              <p>HMS Trafalgar was probably the only foreign non-US sub I've seen.</p>
              <p>US Carrier Task Force normally includes the USNS supply ships, Oliver Hazard Perry frigates, Arleigh Burke destroyers and the Ticonderoga cruisers. The Aegis system mounted on the Ticonderoga is seriously monstrous in proportions, if you look at the profile of the superstructure, you'll realise the bridge is nearly 2 storeys high, and the 2 storeys below it is one half of the Aegis radar. The other half is at the aft part. The weight of the system alone supposedly causes much hull fatigue. If you include the fact that it embarks 2 helicopters and can carry 166 SSMs, you can start to imagine how big the cruiser is. Sadly I didn't get a chance to see the insides before, but some of my kakis had a chance to see the insides, apparently its a mini-city with ATMs for foreign currencies included.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
