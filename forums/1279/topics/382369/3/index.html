              <p>As for what people like hack care us, i would like to come into
              this conclusion. Go up to the authorities lorh. They think we are
              terrorists, we go up to the authorities, ask them help us
              advertise. We are bus fans, not terrorists. But we have the freedom
              to take pictures anywhere we want actually, but Singapore too
              strict already, the authorities the brain stuff too much rubbish
              le, din notice that there's a group of bus fans in Singapore. As
              for TWS's case, they have no rights to call the police coz that's
              not a protected area.</p>

              <p>Only LTA can change things if they are actually interested in nuturing a community of transportation fans/spotting.</p>
              <p>The day Sep 11 happened, the day the official "Friends of PTO" aspect is dead. With the added aspect of STOMP, PTOs has all the more reason not to trust us.</p>
              <p>In their mind, there is no reliable method of telling a spotter and a terrorist apart. If something ever happens on our soil, you can be sure that photography of transport anywhere would be hard-banned.</p>

              <p>9818A : That one is really suey xiao. Pretended to act blur and
              would not take any explanation. "<em>Bus fan? What bus fan?
              Interested in buses? You're *must* be a terrorist right?</em>"</p>
              <p>I believe even if I asked in advance, he would have chosen to
              probe further and the same would have still happened. It happened
              to be that 1% nasty one of the whole BC/SL population. You won't
              know one until you actually bump into one.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>If you had asked, he would have probed further and probably said that he does not want his bus to be photographed. You could have just followed his instruction and try again another day. I don't think there would have been such a commotion at all. End of story.</p>
              <p>By taking the photograph without asking or at least notifying him, he has totally no idea of your intentions. This makes him feel threatened by your presence and he will naturally not accept or be suspicious of any explanation that you offer. Why? You can say that he feels that he has something to hide, but it's human nature to turn defensive when you do something that is least expected!</p>
              <p>I have been taking photos for 4, coming to 5 years and I have NEVER had any problems with bus captains. I've not been hauled by by transit security or the police or any government official so far and I hope it remains the case.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's just my fortune that I have never met any nasty ones, but still, I think it's very much how people carry themselves nowadays when they go out and take photographs, from behaving suspiciously at bus interchanges to running around with scant regard to traffic. All these actions only make people express unnecessary concern and cause so many misunderstandings.</p>

              <p>That's why I say u guys got to be careful. Really, try nt to take pic outside the interchange. I understand nothing is wrong but it would really cause alot of misunderstanding. Especially the BNL exit,  where traffic is so busy,</p>
              <p>I personally suggest to take pic like 100m away frm the terminals/depots/interchange.</p>

              <p>All I can say is to use some basic common sense and to use your noodle if you want to take photographs.

              <p>What do you think they will think when they see some goondu with a bigass DSLR taking photos of...... <em>buses</em>? Or taking photos of the layout of the interchange? Only a small proportion of people share your enthusiasm for bus photography; everyone else would think that you're either plain nuts, or a terrorist doing recce. Remember how some terrorists did recce work at Yishun MRT?</p>
              <p>Same goes for being on the bus. Ask the bus captain first; if he says no, then no means <em>no</em>. Just shut up and suck thumb. Know your place; the bus captain is the master of the bus and all those who are on it, and not you.</p>
              <p>And yeah, like Bear said, please employ basic safety procedures while taking photos. You do <em>not</em> want to appear on The New Paper under the headline 'Young Man Gets Crushed By Double-Decker Because of Enthusiasm for Buses.'</p>

              <p>Hello. Your post is critically offensive to us.</p>
              <p>Please post with the right attitude and tone, your post is just gonna start an argument its not giving a constructive opinion or comment to learn from. You don't like what we do, shut up and move out. If uncle bear saw the incident he should go and approach the person and not come here and rant. For all you know the person may not be a bus enthusiast who surfs SGF with the other bus forums elsewhere.</p>
              <p>We know what is traffic safety. Although some people in this community may be a little extreme, insulting them is not the way to do it. Everyone in life has something they like to do, they spend time and effort on it due to showing interest in it. What you like, may not be of others. Here is to discuss our likings for buses, if you dont have that, you dont have to be here to give your useless selfish thoughts. Go to speaker's corner where you can entertain the mosquitoes and the birds.</p>
              <p>I know you don't really freaking care, you think we're a bunch of loonies and that you're here just to be an insult, to be unreasonable annoying and totally of no purpose but to putting others down to gain some self satisfaction, how critically insecure.</p>
              <p>I do have a heart to tell you what I feel. Kindly move along if you got nothing constructive and affirming to say, by that I meant words put in a proper gentlemanly tone and words that have the desire to help. Otherwise, you just deserve to be ignored.</p>

              <p>In fact most of the time when I encounter such incidents I just ignore. I don't feel the need to respond to these despos that want to be awarded the medal for some public spiritness thing, so yup, ignoring them is much better than being confronted by them; some of them have absolutely nothing to do other than try to be a ficticious superhero and save the world.</p>
              <p>And to the rest that are taking the chance to pass on some stupid negative comments about buses as a hobby, just get lost - this thread is meant for people to share their experiences and not hear some bullcrap story from people that are too free and have nothing better else to do. It's not as if we done some mighty criminal act in the world that requires your two dollars worth of bullshit, so save that.</p>

              you dont have that, you dont have to be here to give your useless
              selfish thoughts. Go to speaker's corner where you can entertain

              <p>Yes yes. We do ask permission from Bus Captains before snapping interior shots of buses. We do not take photos inside bus interchanges as it is said by Interchange personnel to be a security threat to do so, thus, there isnt really any authority to seek permission from. Snapping pictures on normal roads, we cant expect the driver to stop in the middle of the road for us to ask permission. I, myself, will not do such things if a person in authority does not allow it, in fact I will apologise and walk off, neither will I rant here, unless the person is being unreasonable. </p>
              <p>Sometimes, drivers do not understand why they are being photographed, they misunderstood it as company personnel catching them for doing something wrong (they feel that way cause of the way their management handles them), which in return, some turn hostile but after some explaining, the misunderstanding clears.</p>
              <p>Also, to add on, the very fact Aviation Enthusiasts worldwide clearly take pictures at and around Changi Airport and airports around the world openly with the biggest most bizarre cameras that look like weapons, wouldnt they be called crazy too?</p>
              <p>The very fact is Bus Enthusiasts are at least in the tens of thousands worldwide, only that they are not so commonly found in Singapore which has around a few hundred only. There are people I know of who are interested in ships, cranes and even containers, honestly containers is a little extreme. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p>Was waiting to snap 670Z on 169 along WDL Ave 9. Suddenly a car pulled up to me (I was standing at the median) and stopped <strong>in the middle of the road</strong>. Driver then rolled down his window and asked what I was doing. I gave him his answer, but at the same time I felt like calling the police to summon this stupid driver for unnecessary obstruction on the road. Why couldn't he just concentrate on driving?</p>
              <p>In any case, if you do see drivers taking out their handphones to snap a photo of you while in motion, and you do have a photo of that, feel free to mail it to the relevant authorities for inappropriate conduct while driving. They are not supposed to be using their phones while in motion - I don't understand why they can't just drive their bloody bus along.</p>
              <p>A few months ago I was stopped by a security guard while snapping photos and he claimed that I needed to have a permit for photography as "photography in public places is prohibited". (I quote exactly what he said - till this day I still remember it clearly because it was the most absurd and ridiculous piece of bullshit from the mouth of a security guard)</p>
              <p>So you can see, Singaporeans are too afraid of bus photographers. I mean, it's ok to have some public mindedness, but not overdo it! If we don't look like terrorists to them, why should they bother. =/ They feel that we pose some superficial threat to them - is there?</p>

              <p>most of my (few) photo-taking experiences were either neutral or positive. 119 bc's usually recognise me because of my frequent presence on the buses, and will slow down while turning out of sengkang interchange for me to take a shot. of course, this is provided that no other buses are behind.</p>

              <p>Okay.... so now we are on the same wavelength?</p>
              <p>I am just super bemused at how some posters seem to think that
              you can just suka suka take photos and then get all indignant when they
              are told off.</p>
              <p>To use an analogy, I'm driving a car, and I stop at
              a junction. Then some car enthusiast just suka-suka steps up and takes
              a photo of me driving it just because he likes the model of my car. Get
              my drift? My privacy is not being respected. Now just replace 'car' with 'bus', and the idea is there.</p>
              <p>At the very least, ask permission from the bus captain, even for
              external shots. At least wave at him a little bit and gesture to him
              that you want to take a photo of his bus. If he shakes his head, so be it. If the bus is moving, then okay, you don't have to ask him. But if a bus inspector comes up to you and asks you what you are doing, then please show respect to him.</p>
              <p>Never mind about the aviation nuts. Just be a responsible bus nut, that's all I'm saying.</p>

              <p>The very fact is Bus Enthusiasts are at least in the tens of thousands worldwide, only that they are not so commonly found in Singapore which has around a few hundred only. There are people I know of who are interested in <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ships</span></strong>, cranes and even containers, honestly containers is a little extreme. <img src="http://buses.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Seen one small group of them.. belonged to some group called Military Nuts or something. These guys are into the engineering and the mechanism of military weapons in Armed Forces around the world. A sub-group are interested in ships. They can spend the entire 2 visiting days (total 14 hours) of IMDEX Asia to take a look at all 40+ warships at the berths at Changi.</p>
