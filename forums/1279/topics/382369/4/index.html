              <p>I would take this kind of hybrid buses as a stepping stone to
              something more green, perhaps a full electric or alternative source
              energy powered vehicle.</p>
              <p>Yes, there are plenty of materials wasted and destroyed,
              emissions made in the production of the vehicle. Heck, even the bus
              bodywork is made from limited materials mined from the earth. Given
              the current situation however, there seems to be little alternative
              to this.</p>
              <p>I would take Japan as an example here, they manufacture the
              batteries and produce the hybrid buses and vehicles. Industries
              have caps on emissions as well, not only the vehicles, hence the
              government there implemented laws to restrict industrial emissions,
              all the way from manufacturing to the end user. Recycling to them
              is almost a compulsory thing as well. A complete package of
              restriction is necessary to ensure that the end product is more
              efficient in inflicting less harm on the environment than a
              conventional method made product. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hd-videoconverter.com/mts-video-converter-how-to-convert-mts-files.html">MTS Video Converter</a></p>
              <p>However if you are presenting the point that 'we're still not
              doing enough for the environment', I would like to hear from you;
              what kind of bus or vehicle would be the ultimate green vehicle? Do
              not take this as a challenge; I just want to hear from your
              point.</p>
