              <p>While taking photos of buses, whether SBST or SMRT, on service, off service or training, are there any special or "special" occasions which made that shot/event memorable or unforgettable?</p>
              <p>I'm sure most of you (and me) bus shutterbugs have seen a fare share of BC's, training instructors or any other staff/passenger on board presenting you with different reactions, whether on the face, on the hands, or even the fingers, right?</p>
              <p>Now this thread is more for those bus-snappers sharing their experience/stories about these stuff. I shall start with mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've started bus photography since Nov last year. I've seen BC's who stop longer at bus-stops for me to get a better shot, slow down on the roads safely if there is no bus-stop for our benefit (thanks!) and even BC's that pose or wave after I snap. So far I've not gotten the finger before, but have been hit with high beam and got horned at. The most common ones would be the BC's ignoring me, continue driving as if I was invisible (that's normal). After this personal experience which happened to me this morning, I somehow felt like 'WTH!?'</p>
              <p>I was outside HGDEP (along HG Ave 3) this morning snapping some training buses (esp 210L) and I snapped this particular trainer and student's SBS499X along the straight road along Ave 3 before turning into Defu and it didn't pass the red light so I decided to go snap the rear. Suddenly, the instructor got down the bus and shouted "OI!" and "HARLOW!" in a rude and offensive manner. The lights went green and he took out his cellphone, boarded the bus, and started snapping pictures of me. (zzz) The second time, he came out of HGDEP along Defu, and as usual, started snapping me. I then used sign language, trying to say "what do you want?" the driver (student) then started laughing. The third time while I gave up waiting for 210L, 499X came back and the darn instructor continued snapping pictures of me standing at the junction waiting for the green light to cross the road. Now this is ridiculous.</p>
              <p>That's my most bizarre experience and I've sent a letter to SBST. Wonder what's with these people. Share your's here too about how serious is it, did you send letter to SBST or not etc.! (:</p>

              <p>While taking photos of buses, whether SBST or SMRT, on service, off service or training, are there any special or "special" occasions which made that shot/event memorable or unforgettable?</p>
              <p>I'm sure most of you (and me) bus shutterbugs have seen a fare share of BC's, training instructors or any other staff/passenger on board presenting you with different reactions, whether on the face, on the hands, or even the fingers, right?</p>
              <p>Now this thread is more for those bus-snappers sharing their experience/stories about these stuff. I shall start with mine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've started bus photography since Nov last year. I've seen BC's who stop longer at bus-stops for me to get a better shot, slow down on the roads safely if there is no bus-stop for our benefit (thanks!) and even BC's that pose or wave after I snap. So far I've not gotten the finger before, but have been hit with high beam and got horned at. The most common ones would be the BC's ignoring me, continue driving as if I was invisible (that's normal). After this personal experience which happened to me this morning, I somehow felt like 'WTH!?'</p>
              <p>I was outside HGDEP (along HG Ave 3) this morning snapping some training buses (esp 210L) and I snapped this particular trainer and student's SBS499X along the straight road along Ave 3 before turning into Defu and it didn't pass the red light so I decided to go snap the rear. Suddenly, the instructor got down the bus and shouted "OI!" and "HARLOW!" in a rude and offensive manner. The lights went green and he took out his cellphone, boarded the bus, and started snapping pictures of me. (zzz) The second time, he came out of HGDEP along Defu, and as usual, started snapping me. I then used sign language, trying to say "what do you want?" the driver (student) then started laughing. The third time while I gave up waiting for 210L, 499X came back and the darn instructor continued snapping pictures of me standing at the junction waiting for the green light to cross the road. Now this is ridiculous.</p>
              <p>That's my most bizarre experience and I've sent a letter to SBST. Wonder what's with these people. Share your's here too about how serious is it, did you send letter to SBST or not etc.! (:</p>

              <p>Sometimes I get the same results as you from drivers and instructors. But there are some instructors that see me snapping their buses, yet they ignore me and just continue the work they are doing. But there are some drivers who don't like to have their buses to be snapped. So all I do is to either walk away or just snap other buses that I see.</p>

              <p><br>I was trying to snap a few photos of the shuttle buses when the officer, without my knowledge, went to call in the police. The officer did nothing else; the two policemen took action. I handed them over my IC (which I just received at that time) and then I was forced to wait for about 20 minutes. Once everything was over, the policemen told me that they would "follow-up".</p>
              <p>Actually no "follow-up" action was done in the next two weeks since that day.</p>
              <p>Such cases and similar ones highlight the severity of the limitations bus photographers in Singapore have. While other bus enthusiasts from other countries get to enjoy privelleges such as taking photos of buses in terminals and interchanges, we Singapore bus enthusiasts ultimately do not have them. Worse, with the public's mindset of us being 'terrorists', having the freedom to take photos of buses is much limited.</p>

              <p>I must say that there are some people who don't understand what our hobby is about and won't do any harm. There are some people who think that our hobby is an act of terrorism which I don't agree about. What I can say to those people out there is that we are doing this as a past time, not something that has harm.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Nowadays, they used "security of local transport system" as an excuse after a bus and trains got bomb in UK. You know, the video that replayed X number of times at MRT station. Therefore, it is best to avoid taking photos at bus terminal, interchange or MRT/LRT station. I label them as hot spot or sensitive places. I prefer tourist area like Orchard, much more freedom. Talking about that, I had an interesting and funny incident. I shot Sv 14 Strider at Orchard. When I got back at Clementi, I was at the bus stop in front/beside Clementi interchange waiting for Sv 106 to Bkt Batok. Guess what ? I bumped into the bus driver of that Sv 14 Strider ! He recognised me and ask me why I am taking photo of his bus, ask me if I am from the press, SBSTransit, LTA etc I replied him, Uncle, don't worry, I just take for self keep sake, hobby not from any Govt organisation. He like ok ok then took Sv 105 and left. LOL</p></div>

              <p>Was waiting to snap 670Z on 169 along WDL Ave 9. Suddenly a car pulled up to me (I was standing at the median) and stopped <strong>in the middle of the road</strong>. Driver then rolled down his window and asked what I was doing. I gave him his answer, but at the same time I felt like calling the police to summon this stupid driver for unnecessary obstruction on the road. Why couldn't he just concentrate on driving?</p>
              <p>In any case, if you do see drivers taking out their handphones to snap a photo of you while in motion, and you do have a photo of that, feel free to mail it to the relevant authorities for inappropriate conduct while driving. They are not supposed to be using their phones while in motion - I don't understand why they can't just drive their bloody bus along.</p>
              <p>A few months ago I was stopped by a security guard while snapping photos and he claimed that I needed to have a permit for photography as "photography in public places is prohibited". (I quote exactly what he said - till this day I still remember it clearly because it was the most absurd and ridiculous piece of bullshit from the mouth of a security guard)</p>
              <p>So you can see, Singaporeans are too afraid of bus photographers. I mean, it's ok to have some public mindedness, but not overdo it! If we don't look like terrorists to them, why should they bother. =/ They feel that we pose some superficial threat to them - is there?</p>
