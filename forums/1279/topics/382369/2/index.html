              <p>i was alerted of this topic by someone..</p>
              <p>anyone of you idiots was that asshole who almost got killed in front of the church opposite the Cathay?</p>
              <p>you fricken idiot.. you pranced onto the road oblivious of oncoming vehicles, endangering everyone around you..</p>
              <p>a car had to swerve hard to miss turning you into a smear on the road while you snapped away at a bus happily..</p>
              <p>everyone at the bus stop and around were glaring at your stupidity and almost destroying a good car and traumatising a driver with your insanity and almost your pointless death...</p>
              <p>now, if you want to take a good picture without traumatising everyone, and causing a road hazard, we don't give a shit whether you live or die.. but die somewhere else... do not give grief to others..</p>
              <p>go buy a 400mm or more lens on your stupid DSLR and take the goddamned picture from somewhere else...</p>
              <p>please.. if you have to die to profess your unnatural obsession for a bigass box on wheels, try not to let your stupidity and insanity and lust for public transportation inflict misery on others.. goodness knows you're already embarassing yourself and therefore your relatives as it is without your cause of death on the death cert as "<em>ran over by vehicle when he dashed into the middle of the road to take a picture of a bus</em>"</p>

              <p>While I'm considered an enthusiast myself, I can't understand the obsession of certain individuals towards bus photography, especially when locations, services, makes and models are repeated over and over.</p>

              <p><br>yes i agree. that was way too hardcore and has no sense of safety for himself. imo, would you sacrifice your life to get a shot of a rare/significant cameo and get killed halfway and in the end, unable to post it OR miss the chance to shoot or maybe board it and maybe get a ticket and hopes that it happens again next time?</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking I'm quite irritated by folks that only talk photos everywhere they go, the moment they have a chance to do so or etc. It gets on my nerves naturally as the whole thing on buses don't just revolve about a camera and photographs! And so, I cannot find a reason to explain their bizzare behaviour. I hope they can find something else to do with relation to buses and gain more exposure on a larger variety of bus-related issues instead of talking photographs every single time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
