              <p>Just another of my ideas...</p>
              <p>Heres what can I think of:</p>
              <p>Drivers:</p>
              <p>1#: The one who is always soaking wet from driving</p>
              <p>#2: The old one who is actually really good</p>
              <p>#3: The one who shows off his skills (especially young ones)</p>
              <p>#4: The one who tries to make driving pleasant but not appreciated by passengers</p>
              <p>#5: The one who thinks driving is a competition between others</p>
              <p>#6: The one who just wants to keep driving and end up sleeping</p>
              <p>#7: The one who dosent know where he is going or even where is he now (Very rare)</p>
              <p>#8: The normal one</p>
              <p>#9: The one who bursts all the time</p>
              <p>#10: The one who suddenly screams out of nowhere</p>
              <p>I come up with passengers soon</p>
              <p>Meanwhile what are others out there?</p>

              <p>Haha if you drive the O405G the same way as a A24, of course the O405G will look very scary. O405G is 17 years ago technology, that model dont even have ABS iirc. The MAN technology on the A24 makes it a lot more stable even if the driver is violent. Is just like the Volvo Olympian Vs Volvo B9TL also.</p>

              <p>With based on mileage and frequency contracting,It's wiser to be late 1-3 mins for every bus stops for 1st &amp; last bus.LTA will fine you minimum of $96 for failing the 1st and last bus.</p>

              <p>Because he know O405G don't have telematic system thus SMRT can't access to his driving behaviour,Same goes for SBST BCs driving MK IVs,VOs and VSOs</p>

              <p>All, I see more and more bus drivers driving so slow which is as
              good as crawling just to ensure they keep to time schedules. I find
              this nonsensical. They want to ensure some passengers are able to
              board the buses but let’s be practical. Even if they miss the bus,
              there is always another bus coming up in less than 10 minutes.
              There is no need to purposely do until this extent and let many
              others on board the current bus wait aimlessly for few minutes.
              Just let it be natural and no need for this sort of crawling and
              worse, bus stopping there for few minutes with no people in sight.
              Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Totally agree with this... its just downright frustrating having your journey time increase because of buses that move at a snail's pace all thanks to some stupid LTA rule... Honestly what much of a difference does it make waiting a few minutes longer for a bus as compared to bus arriving early yet drive at 25-30km/h max speed and/or stopping at empty bus stops? Had really bad experiences with slow driving buses in the past, was even late for an appointment because of this... </p>
