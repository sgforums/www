            <div class='col-md body'>i have some comments on svc 966.<br><br>1) don't understand why boarding towards woodlands can only be done at the bus stop opposite parkway parade. many people would not wish to climb the overhead bridge and chase after the bus, especially when they're carrying many things or when it's raining. most people would rather board at the bus stop outside the post office where it's more convenient.<br><br>2) buses usually stop after the exit from the parkway parade carpark or after the roundabout at marine parade road and wait for a few minutes before changing the EDS/preparing for the return trip. it's very dangerous if you are familiar with the road conditions there. cant they just make it a loop service like 858 without changing the direction/fare stages? hell, 858 has a longer route but the driver doesn't wait/change the route direction at terminal 2.<br><br>any comments?</div>
