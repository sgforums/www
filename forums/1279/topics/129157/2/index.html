A business is required to make a profit in order to sustain itself.  If I don't make a profit, then there is no money for me to buy food and thus live long enough to write the next book!<br>Unfortunately,  the unit ptice for printing is a more than the $20 you mention!</div>

This store sold the Singapore Buses Handbook by Danny C.Y. Chan at one time. The last time I went there, there is a small collection of Hong Kong Buses Yearbook. Perhaps they would be interested to stock this book?</div>
