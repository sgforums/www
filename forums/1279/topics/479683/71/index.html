              <p><strong>Note: The following was done on 31 Dec 2015 (New Year's
              Eve).</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New year eve loading on 109 SD (SBS8620J)<br> I happened to be at Serangoon Int and observed long queues for 109,
              so I decided to board. Bus behind is 15 mins.<br> (Technically it's not PM peak)</p>
              <p>(16:53) Serangoon Int - 70 (2 pax chose not to board)<br> Serangoon Ave 2 - [-3] 67<br> (17:00) Boundary Rd - [-16+4] 55, [-1] 54<br> (17:03) Yio Chu Kang Link - [+1] 55<br> (17:03) Yio Chu Kang Rd - 55, 55, [+1] 56, [-2+5] 59, [+7] 66<br> (17:13) Hougang Ave 9 - [-29+3] 40, [-14+2] 28, [-10] 18<br> (17:17) Hougang Ave 4 - [-3+1] 16, [-2] 14<br> (17:20) Buangkok Green - [-3+2] 13, 13<br> (17:22) Sengkang East Rd - 13, [-2] 11, [-1+2] 12, [-1+1] 12, [+2]
              14<br> (17:30) TPE - 14<br> (17:36) Pasir Ris Dr 12 - [-2+3] 15<br> (17:37) Pasir Ris Dr 1 - [-1+2] 16, 16, 16, [+1] 17, [-1] 16, 16,
              [+3] 19 (Pasir Ris MRT, 17:41 - I alighted here)</p>
              <p>- Surprising to see so many pax alighting at Boundary Rd<br> - Most pax alight at Hougang Ave 9, maybe because of CCL they
              alight at Serangoon and take 109 (instead of 72/116 at Hougang). Or
              they were shopping at NEX<br> - Make sense for DDs as they travel quite long to Hougang Ave
              9<br> - Somehow there were pax boarding at Yio Chu Kang Rd... Guess
              they're going to Hougang 1 mall</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You took the bus on a day when most people take 1/2 day or do not go to work, yet the loading is quite good. This is typical PM loading from S'goon Interchange before 109A kicks in. From 430pm to about 6pm, you have long queues and the KUBs/Citaros are not able to tank the load.</p>
              <p>Every bus gets approx. 70 pax and most alight along HG Ave 9. Few alight at Boundary road and this should not be a surprise because there are huge HDBs there and people can alight and walk straight home rather than crossing road with 22/53/315/317. Having said this, if queue on 109 is long many do take 315/317 from interchange to Boundary road as well.</p>
              <p>Regarding those boarding at YCK road, this is normal. Especially the stop after AMK Ave 3, you have a good 15-20 people who board, and these are mostly transfer pax from other services. 109 alighting along YCK road is almost 0 or those who board at Boundary road as people prefer the more direct option of 43/43M/70. </p>

              <p>I would say 16 buses is good enough, but need 8 DDs, 8 SDs. Need 2 extra DDs to take care of the Serangoon-HG Ave 9 loading, as all the DDs are timed bet 4.30-5.45pm from Changi Village to Serangoon. The first DD starts from Serangoon only around 6pm. </p>

              <p>Also note work has started. Last week was between Christmas and NY and many people take holiday to finish off their leave or leave work early to shop etc.</p>
              <p>From this week onwards, we should measure the true loading on 47, 117, 118, 979 and 983. Cheers! :)</p>

              <p>- Only have one thing to say: URGENT NEED FOT PEAK PERIOD SPUR TO SENGKANG AND HOUGANG. The number says it all; need me repeat? Clearly some arrogant user here insists he knows it all and denounces it as being "pampering", further flagging the majority as minority. The world doesnt only turn around your dear little town; there are more people staying elsewhere.</p>

              <p>- Extremely disappointing travel time. 40 mins to Khatib, an hour to Sembawang. BC macam driving golf cart. C'mon, its been two weeks, how long will it take to learn the route! Given how many stops were skipped the ride to Khatib should have been 20 mins or, at max, 25 mins. Cannot imagine the time needed when the new flats kick in at Punggol, Canberra and Ave 1! Fellow friends, do not be fooled by the express sector. The speed is crazy slow. For a svc to be EXPRESS the speed has to be too. We are talking about wide, empty roads here btw. Only then will ppl want to take this in/out of Punggol.</p>
              <p>- This svc do not deserve DDs at the Canberra sector. Rather this svc needs FLEET ADD as ppl tend to choose the much more frequent 169 over 117. Only with competitive freq can this svc snatch pax in the northern end. </p>

              <p>- Only have one thing to say: URGENT NEED FOT PEAK PERIOD SPUR
              TO SENGKANG AND HOUGANG. The number says it all; need me repeat?
              Clearly some arrogant user here insists he knows it all and
              denounces it as being "pampering", further flagging the majority as
              minority. The world doesnt only turn around your dear little town;
              there are more people staying elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, that person who says pampering is me! Your figures given show no need for urgent need to sengkang and Hougang. There is sbs 27 and Sbs 89 to transfer to. There is no such thing as my dear little town. If LTA sees the need to, they will introduce a total new service for Sengkang in future which I believe will come soon. There is no need to resort to such petty ways of talking which is clearly in your mind. There is totally no need to have offsprings of sbs 118. New services should be the way to connect sengkang west especially. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>- Extremely disappointing travel time. 40 mins to Khatib, an
                                  hour to Sembawang. BC macam driving golf cart. C'mon, its been two
                                  weeks, how long will it take to learn the route! Given how many
                                  stops were skipped the ride to Khatib should have been 20 mins or,
                                  at max, 25 mins. Cannot imagine the time needed when the new flats
                                  kick in at Punggol, Canberra and Ave 1! Fellow friends, do not be
                                  fooled by the express sector. The speed is crazy slow. For a svc to
                                  be EXPRESS the speed has to be too. We are talking about wide,
                                  empty roads here btw. Only then will ppl want to take this in/out
                                  of Punggol.</p>
              <p>- This svc do not deserve DDs at the Canberra sector. Rather
                                  this svc needs FLEET ADD as ppl tend to choose the much more
                                  frequent 169 over 117. Only with competitive freq can this svc
                                  snatch pax in the northern end. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I am not self-delusional. Time will tell if a new service is needed. I am not conservative. For me, if a route has super high demand and requires a new service, so be it. Introduce a new service. No need for whatever spur or offsprings of a current service. Moreover, the route is to a different destination so it should not be M or P or whatever letter. Should be totally new number. But currently, it is still too early to judge. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, Spurs and offsprings should be used if they are parts of the original route. However in this case, it is to a new destination completely. Routes are different and should definitely use new numbers. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, Spurs and offsprings should be used if they are
              parts of the original route. However in this case, it is to a new
              destination completely. Routes are different and should definitely
              use new numbers. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I understood you travelled frequently either for work or leisure. I understood other countries have such cases. However what I meant is local singapore context. There will be many people who get confused by same number going to different places. Older residents sometimes are unable to differentiate with an extra letter behind the same number. </p>
              <p>Towns by towns will be beefed up with new services. CCK, punggol, yishun are beefed up. Sengkang west will be one of the next few. Interchange is currently being expanded. Authorities are looking into it one by one. Everybody turn especially new towns will come. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>How much does the students actually pay for their bus fares only? $0.36? $0.56? Some even travel on concession fares of $27.50/month for bus concession pass while we adults pay $0.79 to $2++ and yet we do not complain much. </p>
              <p>Like you said, they are students. Students would plan their travel time and check the sgbuses app for the bus freq as they are tech-savvy. If the frequency of sv 118 is too long, im pretty sure there's Sv 27 and Sv 168 to tampines as well. Better frequency? The demand now does not prove otherwise. I'm pretty sure that LTA and SBS Transit will increase the frequency and pump in buses when the timing is ripe. Right now, just let it be. It's like Sv 45 in the past few years. [Look at Sv 45 now? DDs and high freq during peak hours.]</p>
              <p>Sv 118 might be another Sv 72 in the near future to have 11 buses serving the high demand sectors while might be temasek polytechnic to jalan kayu stretch(hopefully), and high freq during school dismissal periods. Sv 72 is different because it also caters to industrial folks along amk ave 5 and tampines while most folks taking 118 are students.</p>
              <p>Nowadays bus services run on 10-15mins freq ppl also complain.. in the past buses come within 15 minutes we cheo high high liao.. I think the old folks taking sv 115 should complain because it is meant to create convenience for old folks along hougang ave 3 and the frequency is 15-20mins. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, that person who says pampering is me! Your
              figures given show no need for urgent need to sengkang and Hougang.
              There is sbs 27 and Sbs 89 to transfer to. There is no such thing
              as my dear little town. If LTA sees the need to, they will
              introduce a total new service for Sengkang in future which I
              believe will come soon. There is no need to resort to such petty
              ways of talking which is clearly in your mind. There is totally no
              need to have offsprings of sbs 118. New services should be the way
              to connect sengkang west especially. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I think you read the wrong post. Better freq for 117, not 118. This is due to the inherent nature of pax pool in the North, where they look out for the more frequent buses to board. If 117 remain at its current freq it isnt gonna get optimistic loading in the North. </p>
              <p>For 118, I was pushing for a spur seeing how majority of pax alight to head down to Sengkang South, and it will do them good to have a peak-period trip down without transferring. </p>
