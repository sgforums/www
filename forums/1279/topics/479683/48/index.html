              <p>I think the new ITH will be like Joo Koon type,9 service max but i was hoping that LTA plan at least 25 parking lots.Good if svc 8 &amp; 18 to start there alongside 4 new service for a start.Can use 68 &amp; 71 numbers too.Bidadari &amp; Tengah new town also coming in future.Bidadari can use 14x series while Tengah probably need new numberings or can continue using 20x series after Kent Ridge.Upp East Coast Expansion and Changi Business Park can use 44,46,47 alongside a new service,Most probably 42 &amp; 48 might start from either of these terminals.</p>

              <p>Yes ofcourse there will be new services. That's why Tampines North Interchange is being built. I also suspect some Tampines interchange services to be extended to Tampines North.</p>
              <p>27/72/168 already have huge loading. By then you can expect a route complementing 27 and feeder to Tampines MRT.</p>

              <p>Definitely not. The peak has already passed when you take bus at 19.35 from Clarke Quay. 851 buses leaving BMR Interchange between 17.00 and 18.30 hours are packed on its route, especially the 17.45-19.00 slot at Bugis/Little India side. That's where the high capacity buses are needed and are not enough. </p>

              <p>Few months back there was rumor that DDs will be deployed on 265 and 268... also 269 and 138... but none of these 4 services got DDs...</p>
              <p>wonder why!!! AMDEP deployers quite resistant to give feeders DDs unlike other depots. It really does not make sense given the number of SD buses they have added to 261, 265, 269... if few DDs would have been added job would have been done. </p>

              <p>Please don't be surprised by what I'm gonna post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On Friday, 3rd July 2015, I was at Yio Chu Kang Rd (first stop after YCK Link towards AMK/Hougang) from 1745 hrs to around 1800 hrs. I took note of loading on some buses, although I didn't take note of the time:</p>
              <p>43M DD: upper deck full, lower deck at least 12 standees</p>
              <p>43 DD: average 5-8 standees on lower deck, upper deck full (even when only 2 mins after 43M)</p>
              <p>147 DD: average 7-10 standees on lower deck, upper deck full</p>
              <p>103: average 1-2 standees</p>
              <p>109 SD: average 5-10 standees (some buses are quite packed)</p>
              <p>116: 80% seated (exclusive of the bus I took, which is elaborated below)</p>
              <p>156: average 2-5 standees (some buses are quite packed)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then I took 116 to Hougang Ctrl Int, which reached AMK Ave 3 at 1805 hrs. General loading:</p>
              <p>Before Serangoon North: 3-5 standees, seats full</p>
              <p>Serangoon North: first stop 80% alighted, 6-7 boarded, 15-20 pax onboard; second bus stop few alighted/boarded</p>
              <p>Hougang 1 Mall: around 15 pax alighted, 5 boarded, less than 10 pax onboard</p>
              <p>After Hougang 1 Mall: 1-2 pax alight at every bus stop, 0 pax when reaching interchange</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Loading of 116 buses in opposite direction along the way:</p>
              <p>Before AMK Ave 3: opposite bus 5-10 standees</p>
              <p>Before Hougang Ave 1: opposite bus 6-7 pax onboard</p>
              <p>Before Hougang Ctrl Int: opposite bus 3-5 standees</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Miscellaneous:</p>
              <p>- At 1824 hrs, 324 reached interchange with at least 10 standees</p>
              <p>- At 1827, 116 departed interchange with 4 standees</p>
              <p>- At 1837, 324 departed fully seated</p>
              <p>- At 1840, 116 departed with 39 pax</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can say 116 is at least not a waste of resources... Loading is growing and is better than 20 pax last time. And who says Serangoon North residents are not taking 116?</p>
              <p>IMO, loading pattern on 116 during PM is: Serangoon -&gt; Serangoon North, Hougang -&gt; Hougang Ave 4/9, Serangoon North -&gt; Serangoon</p>
              <p>Svc 324's loading is also growing... I was totally surprised when I saw the bus with 10 standees. Both 116 and 324 can also form long queues at HCI already (not mentioning those who sit on the stairs nearby waiting for buses). Maybe it's because their berths are closer to MRT Exit A.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>- Very interesting observation along Airport Rd and MacPherson Rd:</p>
              <p>1) Before Aljunied Rd, every stop had 10+ pax boarding, and few pax are waiting for other services</p>
              <p>2) The first stop after Aljunied Rd, 14 pax alighted</p>
              <p>3) For the rest of MacPherson Rd, every stop had 40+ pax waiting, but few took 151</p>
              <p>My guess is that many of these ppl working at MacPherson Rd/Airport Rd area are heading towards Serangoon Rd/Little India etc... Hence so many pax waiting for/transferring to svc 61/64/65/66. Those at Airport Rd/before Aljunied Rd have no choice but to wait for any service there and transfer to 61/64/65/66.</p>
              <p>These days a lot of people in this forum are speculating svc 65/66 etc will be amended or withdrawn due to DTL or whatever... Even if these services are amended, the link between MacPherson Rd and Serangoon Rd/Bendemeer Rd needs to be maintained. Maybe 66 can be amended via MacPherson Rd, Airport Rd, Eunor Link to Bedok Reservoir Rd to reduce duplication with DTL and provide a more direct service for Airport Rd workers.</p>
              <p>(Just my two cents worth)</p>

              <p>&gt;&gt; Checking Transport.sg app, next 156 bus was 12 mins later... and previous 156 bus was also with gap of 12 mins... no traffic encountered anywhere along its route... that's why looks like buses were evely spaced.</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; I think between Sengkang and YCK road due to 43/43M enhanced capacity, loading on 156 has dropped (earlier I remember bus would be packed to door in this sector)</p>
