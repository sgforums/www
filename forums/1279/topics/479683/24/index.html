              <p>* saw While at BPJ ring road, crossing over to 187 that 3503 already makes it return trip to Orchard. Spotted just before entering PIE @ 18.10 hours. This means all 3 buses go to do 19+ hours peak trip again from Orchard to BPJ. </p>
              <p>* the bus I took was not the hottest peak hour! yet had close to 70 pax, 90% long distance travelers! affirming the need for more DDs on 972.</p>

              <p><strong>Jurong East Interchange loading analysis on 143/143M, 51, 79 @18.34 to 19.15</strong></p>
              <p>After a successful joyriding experience on 972, I took 187 from BPJ road to  Jurong central and changed to 98 to go to interchange. </p>
              <p><strong>Sv 51</strong></p>
              <p>18.34 - 7359R - 56p</p>

              <p>19.16 - CDGE - 49p</p>
              <p>* frequency around 15 mins. All back to back DDs. I would say if Sv 51 leaves interchange with 50+ pax easily it will get 20 more pax at Jurong st 13 and Jurong central stops. Seemed like these were dedicated Pandan residents given there was a 143/143M every 04-05 mins.</p>

              <p>* Disastrous loading from JE during PM peak. Guess since 143/143M stop is different from 79 and now 143/143M is more frequent, there are not many takers for 79 from JE in PM. Am of course there will be huge crowds towards  Penjuru and Jurong Port.</p>

              <p>* Teban sector seems too spoiled with too many BSEP buses and high frequency, where during PM peak many buses going with less than 20-25 pax loading. </p>
              <p>* with introduction of 143M, Sv 79 now going virtually empty with DDs having less than 20 pax while leaving interchange. 3 months back around same time, Sv 79 would leave interchange with 40-45 pax and Sv 144 with a range of 60-80 pax. </p>

              <p>19.10 - 3147S - 112p (still 10-15p in queue)</p>
              <p>* 334 loading continue to be super high. Observed 5 back to back DDs with 100+ pax loading just leaving interchange. This means people along Jurong Central stop must be finding difficult to board on some buses.</p>
              <p>* frequency during observed duration seemed around 07-09 mins. </p>
              <p>* Didn't spot the KUB on 334 - looks like time has come for 334 to become full fleet dd.</p>
              <p>* 334 needs a BSEP WEG add. Maybe one of the buses from 143M can be transferred. </p>
              <p>* Even after introduction of Sv 49, loads continue to be supremely high. Shows that if Sv 49 was not there, situation would not be manageable anymore.</p>

              <p>No please. No more P services. Just need more S-shift DDs on 334. 334 off-peak loading also not bad. You see 40-50 pax on bus - very rare to find on most other services.</p>

              <p>I think timing of DDs very off... but good thing is DDs do 4.50-5.30pm stretch on Orchard and again 7.15 to 8.00pm stretch I think, considering time of return trips.</p>
              <p>So me thinks LTA/SMRT is trying to maximize use of ADLs on 972 since they dont have many more to give right now.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2601D, I did not know govt jobs are mostly contract basis now. But who in his right sense of mind will give up his permanent job in private sector now to go for a contract job? For perm jobs now, even if retrenched, he or she will get a tidy payout. For contract job, no guarantee and no sense of security. Even if deep interest may not be worth taking the risk when one has a family to feed. Cheers.</p>

              <p><strong>Frustrating experience while monitoring loading levels for sv 243G, 243W</strong></p>
              <p>* Some aunties so irritating - DD standing with 40 pax and 3 aunties stop in queue and do not board. Ppl behind feel bus full as they cannot see due to wall at the interchange. DD leaves with 44 pax on board. Huge queue of around 30 pax. </p>
              <p>* This happened multiple times on both 243G and 243W, that when bus had 30 pax on board, some people would not board. In some cases, people would squeeze from the queue and board bus, in other cases people would not realize bus not full, and wait in queue like fools.</p>
              <p><strong>243G</strong></p>
              <p>17.35 - 45p - DD</p>
              <p>17.37 - 27p - SD</p>
              <p>17.44 - 63p - SD </p>
              <p>17.47 - 62p - DD </p>
              <p>17.52 - 74p - SD (very funny.. this time around ppl push and squeeze, push and squeeze - 10 more ppl in queue)</p>
              <p>17.58 - 57p - SD</p>
              <p>18.03 - 69p - SD (long queue)</p>
              <p>18.06 - 50p - DD (some 30ppl still in queue)</p>
              <p>18.12 - 78p - DD</p>
              <p>* On average bus every 05 mins. V good frequency.  </p>
              <p><strong>243W</strong></p>
              <p>17.34 - 22p - SD</p>
              <p>17.39 - 58p - DD</p>
              <p>17.42 - 42p - SD</p>
              <p>17.50 - 72p - SD</p>
              <p>17.54 - 43p - SD (ppl in queue do not want to board... too spoilt)</p>
              <p>17.56 - 52p - DD </p>
              <p>18.00 - 44p - DD (3 woman stop... such long queue of 30 pax still there)</p>
              <p>18.05 - 75 - DD</p>
              <p>18.09 - 29 - SD (some 15-20 ppl still in queue... what are they thinking?? bus has only 29 pax.. some ppl can still get place to sit... frustrating!!)</p>
              <p>* Frequency of 04 mins, even better than 243G </p>
              <p>* From loading observation, it felt like even if 243W was full fleet SD, it would be able to manage loading unlike 243G that had each bus around 60+ pax</p>
              <p>* I believe 243W has more AM load, 243G more PM load.</p>
              <p>* <strong>Need ground staff to make sure ppl don't abuse resources and unecessarily make long queues. This in business terms is called inflated "unreal" demand.</strong></p>
              <p>* The basic interchange infrastructure is bad with cement walls... should have glass instead.. ppl cannot see how full the bus is... and innocent ones have to wait.. for mistake of few stupids.</p>

              <p><strong>sv 241 has unique PM loading</strong></p>
              <p>Loading observation on sv 241<strong> </strong>3644Z @ 18.15 from Boon Lay Interchange</p>
              <p>* I observed there was a 241 DD every 03-04 minutes and yet the queues at BNL were very long</p>
              <p>* After survey of 243G/W, decided to take 241.</p>
              <p>Boon Lay Interchange - 78 pax</p>
              <p>Boon Lay St 63 - 87 (0/9)... surprisingly no one alighted</p>
              <p><span style="white-space:pre"> </span>      96 (-3/12)... only 3 alighted but 12 boarded</p>
              <p>Pioneer MRT 112 (-9/25)... many pax left over... in 03 mins... 2 sv 241 DDs came back to back that cleared the entire stop</p>
              <p>** The reason I highlight the above two is that it is normal to have many pax boarding at MRT, but I was surprised that for a service with 3 mins DD frequency, there was still 9 and 12 pax boarding at these two stops</p>
              <p>** Around 66 of the 78 pax that boarded at Boon Lay went beyond Pioneer MRT... I believe PM ppl prefer to alight from MRT at Boon Lay so that they get place to sit... but yet the crowds at Pioneer MRT also quite huge</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes most likely must be NUS, NTU, SMU and I am from there. Yes I am very interested but too bad when I see the contract basis, I hesitated. Haha. Cheers. </p>
