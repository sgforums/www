              <p>sv 65 has bi-directional loading. From what I know you will see high loading from SAFRA/Kaki Bukit and UBI industrial areas towards Little India. Maybe on Mon-Thu, loading between Little India and Orchard at that time not as good as on Fridays.</p>
              <p>sv 65 also has excellent weekend loading because of Orchard / Little India. But come 2017, this will be history.</p>

              <p>You maybe right, but I still feel the Sengkang MP does have a lot more pull than other MPs. How else can we explain DDs on 85, 102, 119 when loading hardly ever crosses 50-55 pax. </p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fleet for CGA Services</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>24 </strong>- Current fleet is doing okay. Many parallel services there to share loading, and most with high capacity buses. Huge parallelism in route with sv 22, sv 28, sv 2 along its route. Sometimes you will see bus crowded at Bedok MRT only to realize people alighted 2 stops later. So even if DDs were possible for this service, max needed few good to have DDs. So no bendy required.</p>
              <p><strong>27</strong> - Current fleet is doing okay. No problem with boarding bus due to high frequency. Issue is comfort level is poor as people have to stand long distance all the way through TPE. If proposed NEL/CBP service is launched, loading on sv 27 will get managed. Moreover new service will have majority high capacity fleet. So no bendy required.</p>
              <p><strong>34</strong> - sv 34 loading is more of concern than sv 27. It acts as intra town and quick connect to Punggol from Tampines. Comfort level is poor + sometimes pax need to wait for next bus. If proposed NEL/CBP service is launched, loading may get shifted and issue can be quickly resolved. So no bendy required.</p>
              <p><strong>36</strong> - Even after adding buses and 36B, sv 36 loading to Orchard in AM and from Suntec in PM is very high. Buses are over crowded. Problem for sv 36/48 is not Tanjong Katong road south, but on the return to MArine Parade, the sleep slope from Rochor to join ECP. Apparently, DDs cannot do the steep slope, not sure if bendies can manage. Even if bendies can, not sure LTA will be happy to introduce bendies in Orchard area. Only fix is if sv 36 is allowed to travel express along sv 518 via Marina Bay Sands to join ECP. Travel time will increase by 03-04 minutes, but maybe more comfort to people.</p>
              <p><strong>53</strong> - After 25 buses and no bus doing 53A/B anymore after 53M launch, I think sv 53 is doing quite okay. No need for additional bus or HC bus at the moment. It is just good to have. No bendy required.</p>
              <p><strong>858</strong> - This service required majority fleet or full fleet bendy. The long distance that it travels MANA22s cannot tank the load. Extremely important for LTA/SMRT to concentrate 858 with maximum bendies. </p>
              <p>So in my evaluation, SBST does not need bendies (except sv 36 but may not be possible due to Orchard area). SMRT is the one that needs at least 20 A24s deployed on sv 858. </p>

              <p><strong>24</strong> - Current fleet is doing okay. Many parallel services there to share loading, and most with high capacity buses. Huge parallelism in route with sv 22, sv 28, sv 2 along its route. Sometimes you will see bus crowded at Bedok MRT only to realize people alighted 2 stops later.

Issue is comfort level is poor as people have to stand long distance all the way through TPE. If proposed NEL/CBP service is launched, loading on sv 27 will get managed. Moreover new service will have majority high capacity fleet. So no bendy required.</p>
              <p><strong>34</strong> - sv 34 loading is more of concern than sv 27. It acts as intra town and quick connect to Punggol from Tampines. Comfort level is poor + sometimes pax need to wait for next bus. If proposed NEL/CBP service is launched, loading may get shifted and issue can be quickly resolved. So no bendy required.</p>

              <p><strong>858</strong> - This service required majority fleet or full fleet bendy. The long distance that it travels MANA22s cannot tank the load. Extremely important for LTA/SMRT to concentrate 858 with maximum bendies. </p>
              <p>So in my evaluation, SBST does not need bendies (except sv 36 but may not be possible due to Orchard area). SMRT is the one that needs at least 20 A24s deployed on sv 858. </p>

              <p><br>Take note that a lot of workers at CGA take services like 27/34/53 and their peak hours is different from that of main working crowds. This is when you see up to half the queue unable to board 34/53. (27 still fine at CGA due to its good frequency)</p>
              <p>I have always seen huge crowds on svc 53 at the airport. Sometimes there are even more passengers onboard than 858, and every single bus has people standing. Of course it may not always be high capacity loading, but it does warrant a few high capacity buses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the Punggol-CBP service, I don't feel that it will totally ease the load on 27/34. It is very unlikely that its route will be the same as 27/34; after all, not everyone is going to Tampines MRT.</p>

              <p>Sorry... it didn't come out right... i meant to say many people use 34 as intra-town service... just look 30 people alight on 3 stops of ave 5 after mrt... most people from cga already alighted at ave 7 (20/26)... also if you see on my journey to cga... peak loading in tampines town went to 50+ but around 30+ alighted in tampines itself with 18 going forward to CGA...</p>
