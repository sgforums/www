              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, of course need to include 109. If going by your theory, sbs 39, sbs 168, smrt 858, smrt 969 all no need already since all go up and down too. Then also no need for the rest of the services to stop at TPE stop too. Since all the bus services which stop at the bus stops need to increase everybody travelling time by 2 to 5 min. Let's get ready to ask LTA demolish the bus stops! Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi mr busAnalayser, I never miss any. As per passenger practice,
              they will always take the first bus which comes to their
              destination. Providing multiple bus services is not a new issue. I
              know sbs 27 is crowded. But still, there will still be spaces at
              times of the day for people to board. </p>
              <p>Sbs 88 to pasir ris drive 3 upper portion. Nothing funny.
              Considered new link. The purpose is not to have so many people
              alighting at these stops at pasir ris drive 3. One of the most
              important objectives of building bus stops at TPE is to further
              improve the bus situations for Punggol and sengkang residents. This
              is to convenience residents there. They understand that not all
              services can go inside and loop at Punggol and sengkang. So it is
              much more practical to get services to bypass these 2 estates and
              give a bus stop on the outskirts. This should be a win-win
              situation right?</p>
              <p>Naturally, bus routes which go along the TPE bus stop must stop
              at it, right? You cannot possibly plan sbs 27 and sbs 88 to skip
              them. Later some other people want sbs 858 not to stop. Then others
              want sbs 39 not to stop, saying very crowded. Another guy wants
              smrt 969 not to stop, saving Punggol guys can take sbs 34 to
              tampines and sengkang guys can take sbs 27. Then another guy says
              sbs 89 is very crowded at peak hours in morning. They want faster
              journey to loyang industrial estate. In the end, each and every
              person do not want their bus service to stop. May as well cancel
              off the project. This should really not be the way. Cheers</p>

              <p>I have no problem with Sv 27 stopping there... Just that there will be no place for people to board, and you will see more complaints than benefit.. If SBST/LTA launch DDs on Sv 27 A just like you now have Sv 143M overlaying on same route, then it will take care of the loading problem. This plea has fallen on deaf years for many years now.</p>
              <p>if you don't do that, then in PM peak for sake of Punggol residents, you will inconvenience Sebgkang/Hougang residents, who won't be able to board Sv 27 before TPE stops. Those wanting to get down at Punggol TPE stop will still have 168 option that can accommodate more pax given it is full fleet dd. Do you see the issue or not?</p>

              <p>Yes they do that. Make all buses call along the stops on the road.. But it may not be the best practice always.. Each situation is different and needs to be evaluated.. Especially when we know some routes are over crowded and have bunching /schedule problems, don't add to it.. You know Sv 27 already has horrible loading/scheduling problems.</p>
              <p>solution: add Sv 27M on full day basis with dd buses.</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, thanks for agreeing sbs 27 should stop at TPE bus stop. In any way, there are always more complaints than compliments from the public. </p>
              <p>For the next point, I beg to differ. Sbs 27 is not only a service meant for hougang/buangkok/sengkang residents. Since it passes by TPE, it rightly will fetch a portion of people from Punggol. If Punggol people can get onto the crowded buses at TPE stop, then good. If they cannot get onto it, then wait for the next bus or other alternative bus services. Why will it be that bad to inconvenience hougang/sengkang residents? Sengkang residents will still benefit on the other side of TPE through shorter walking distance to their houses. Please always bear in mind that sbs 27 does not belong to the prerogative of hougang/buangkok/sengkang residents only. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes I agree loading patterns will change. At first moment, I think the crowds along Punggol road 1st stop before TPE and after TPE will drop. Sbs 83 loading will drop slightly as some people will take sbs 3 and sbs 34 to the new stop to change to other buses. Currently Punggol residents take sbs 83 to Punggol road blk 190C stop or walk over to blk 298A to change buses. I foresee sbs 161 loading towards woodlands will also drop as it will be complemented by sbs 168, smrt 858 and smrt 969 slightly. Even sbs 85 and smrt 965 loading will be affected as the journey to yishun is covered by smrt 969. Sbs 34 loading will drop as smrt 858 brings people directly to Changi airport after TPE stop. Sbs 27 loading may or may not drop slightly and we shall see later. There will be many new links created. Examples are links to seletar camp, sembawang mrt and many more! Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, of course need to include 109. If going by your
              theory, sbs 39, sbs 168, smrt 858, smrt 969 all no need already
              since all go up and down too. Then also no need for the rest of the
              services to stop at TPE stop too. Since all the bus services which
              stop at the bus stops need to increase everybody travelling time by
              2 to 5 min. Let's get ready to ask LTA demolish the bus stops!
              Cheers</p>

              <p>No as in, 109 need to go up, down and instantly up again!!</p>
              <p>I mean, you never notice the route of 109?!</p>
              <p>Let me tell you a fact hor, that the LTA never knew. Some people preferred 109 to get to Sengkang from Pasir Ris due to its less winding road. But now? It has to be caught on a jam and has to wait for another traffic light! Less people would patronise 109! Other svcs like 27 or 89 is okay as they are taking the immediate slip road to continue, but 109 has to go back down again and get up again! This is different from svcs like 168 or 858 as they only will go up again somewhere else, here 109 is serving a bus stop of the exact same neighbourhood it will serve AGAIN!</p>
              <p>Makes no sense to me. </p>
