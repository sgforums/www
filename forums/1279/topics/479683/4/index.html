              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, no need extend. The route is just appropriate. Journey time is also appropriate. If you extend, Punggol drive residents will lose their one and only doorstep bus service sbs 50. It will affect many HDB blocks there. Furthermore, tampines have so many bus services and it serves not much of a purpose anymore. Furthermore, tampines east and west mrt are currently being built. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Cbb bro, whenever u say extend x service or introduce service from Boon Lay to Pasir Ris, you never give reasons behind how this will help people. Sometimes it feels like because you are a bus fan, you just want new services and extensions. Important to explain why you need. For instance, why extend 50 to Tampines... ??</p>

                  st 51. Before that it is only 3-4 pax boarding and alighting.</p>
              <p>** Once again proved loop from HG Ave 2 to HG Interchange is
                  redundant and useless.. only 2 pax were on board, and 7 boarded
                  from HG Ave 2 towards interchange, easily something that can be
                  taken care by DDs on 132</p>
              <p>** Residents along HG Ave 2 prefer to use Kovan for MRT and

                  Int specifically.</p>
              <p>** <strong>Recommendation:</strong> 325 should be extended to
                  Hougang St 21 Terminal instead of terminating back at HG

              <p>I think 72 or 101 hasnt called at the bus stop yet hence the loading. I have not seen a single full to the brim 325 when i last moved out from hougang.</p>

              <p>101 does not call at bus stop near mall at HG St 51 on its return to HG Interchange, hence maybe lot of loading on this one stop.</p>
              <p>Bus was not full to brim. Only 2-3 stops around 60 pax loading and then drop again.</p>

              <p>I feel 6 buses for 325 is more than enough. Why go to the extent of 9 buses?</p>
              <p>There is no need to extend 325's routing. Just cut short. To hougang green people prefer 101 &gt; 325 cause of 325's huge loop (20mins) just to get there. 101 takes only 8-10mins</p>
              <p>Follow 27/161's route to hougang ave 10/ave 6 &gt; hougang st 51 &gt; buangkok green.</p>
              <p>Can use 4-5 buses for this route. I have seen 325's bcs driving slowly because their runtime is too loose. I have seen only 15-20 pax at HG MRT bus stop during evening peak towards hg st 51. No more than that. AM peak wise depends. If BC runtime loose, drive slowly, more people cluster at the bus stop, the maximum loading for 325 is only 50-60. On normal days either fully seated citaro or strider with 2-3 standees.</p>
              <p>101 AM peak wise the peeps on hougang st 51 side wouldnt utilise this svc cause of it's 3 point turn at buangkok link then it will take up an extra 10mins hence they will take 325. Ironic thing is both feeder buses to nearest mrt commuters need to endure an extra 10mins ride towards mrt and from mrt station. </p>
              <p>Some people like to take 72 at buangkok green/ yck road area towards hougang ave 9 or hougang ctrl. Why not? Better than taking 325 to hougang 1 then loop here loop there. 72 is much faster and direct. Thats why you see 72 jampacked from this area towards hougang central during AM peak.</p>
              <p>If you extend 325 to hougang st 21, it will pass by kovan station. Wouldnt this add onto the bus services that duplicates upp serangoon stretch to hougang? Wouldnt it make this extension redundant as well?</p>

              <p><br>Are you surprised? ;) 860 was introduced more than a year ago with full coverage of Yishun Ring road and access to both Khatib and Yishun MRT. Ofcourse 860 loading is very good. It would be a very good candidate to receive DDs in future. It should have received bendies but because it is BSEP it is just doing MANs right now.</p>

              <p>PM loading on 101 definitely more because it reaches HG St 51 faster and has same stops as 325. So definitely people prefer 101 to 325. During rains, you can easily say that 101 eats majority 325 loading. 100+ pax at HG MRT stop during PM peak.</p>
              <p>325's routing is faulty. People at HG St 91/93 also dont like to take it because of long route. Those along st 91 rather walk to Ave 9 and take 72 and those along st 93, take 43 from Buangkok to Serangoon. Much better choice!</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Our flat is located between two stations, Kovan and Serangoon. We don't live next to an MRT station and it is not a short walk. So we are at the mercy of the 113 bus service. We used to have a service called 321 which was quite frequent. But then our interchange got removed and they replaced 321 with a very infrequent 113.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Very often, we wait between 15 to 20 minutes for one to come along. In that time, we can take the train from our Kovan station to Harbourfront.</p>

It's like home is so near, yet so far.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">I think it is time to teach her how to ride a bicycle, carefully, to the train station and save some time and money. And stop her from swearing.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">You know how you tell the feeder bus system has reached the tipping point of annoyance? Your wife asks you if there is a bicycle she can ride to the train station while wearing a skirt.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Our flat is located between two stations, Kovan and Serangoon. We
              don't live next to an MRT station and it is not a short walk. So we
              are at the mercy of the 113 bus service. We used to have a service
              called 321 which was quite frequent. But then our interchange got
              removed and they replaced 321 with a very infrequent 113.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">Very often, we wait between 15 to 20 minutes for one to come along.
              In that time, we can take the train from our Kovan station to
              Harbourfront.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">So what if you have the fastest train service in the world, but the
              WAIT for your feeder bus, the last bit of your journey, is longer
              than the train ride itself? It's like home is so near, yet so
              far.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">I think it is time to teach her how to ride a bicycle, carefully,
              to the train station and save some time and money. And stop her
              from swearing.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">You know how you tell the feeder bus system has reached the tipping
              point of annoyance? Your wife asks you if there is a bicycle she
              can ride to the train station while wearing a skirt.</p>

              <p>53? yes. 45? Nope i dont think so. 45 comes at an interval of 15-20mins during PM peak. No 45B.</p>
