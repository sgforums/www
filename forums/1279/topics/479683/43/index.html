              <p>If this was recorded today at 7:50am, it is obvious the loading
              was low. On a Sunday morning, many people are still sleeping.</p>
              <p>For the most accurate recordings, the best time to record
              loadings of buses is during peak hours, between Monday and
              Thursday. That is usually when buses experience the highest
              loadings and usually, the recordings best represent travel patterns
              and which bus stops are the most utilised.</p>

              <p>During weekday peak hours, loading at Punggol East will obviously be low because nobody is going to visit the malls there.. And residents in Punggol East already have sv 3, 50, 83, 85 and LRT so there's no need for sv 386 (except those closer to bus stops along Edgedale Plains, but sv 386 is still too windy). But on weekends you may see Waterway residents going to Punggol East to go shopping etc... Just some predictions</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, not everybody requests can be satisfied. The extension to Punggol east was 1) at the request of residents further inside to connect to restaurant/shops at plaza and east along tebing lane(Riveria LRT) where there are many F &amp; B. and 2) at the request of punggol central elderly residents to connect to their own children who bought those newer blocks near the waterway. So the extension helps serve dual purposes. However the loading is expected to be minimal for these purposes. Cheers. </p>

              <p>So 9DDs(or 8?) and 1xover right?</p>
              <p>-Xover should be an SD</p>
              <p>- 1x trip weekday </p>

              <p>I think 334 should have fleet of 10 DDs. Add one BSEP DD. No SDs please!! There is always leftover queue in PM for 334. Each bus leaves interchange with 90+ pax. But that is okay coz next bus comes in 5-6 mins. </p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Let me explain the way I do loading analysis</span></p>
              <p>- I post loading observation only on services I take during peak hours (both AM and PM peak)... <em>this is so that I understand the peak hour load... bus upgrades/additions are made keeping peak load in mind, and not weekend/off-peak loading</em></p>
              <p>- I will most of the times post loading of a route that I cover at least 80% of the route... <em>if I just do one part of the route... it may not be a good indicator as the bus might get full later.. and the DD deployed at that timing might be for the part of the route you do not take... its not productive to then assume that DD was not worth it on that timing.. just like we observed recently someone posted 187 DD loading only between Lakeside and Jurong East Ave 1... when the loading can be pretty high between Bukit Batok to Bukit Panjang that was not captured</em></p>

              <p>My previous observation (I don't know if I have posted) is the same. The bus can receive more than 60 pax from LP37 and LP49...</p>
              <p>I guess the reason why people do not alight at Kent Ridge is:</p>
              <p>- The bus stop opposite Kent Ridge MRT exit B is inconvenient. From there, if you want to take CCL, you have to either walk to Exit A along Lower Kent Ridge Rd, or walk to a pedestrian crossing at the junction (which is far), cross the road and walk back to Exit B, enter, then either walk through the entire station to go down to platform via the only escalators/stairs near Exit A, or use the tiny little lift at the other end of the concourse nearer to Exit B (which can be very very crowded during peak hours). You can see how lousy it is.</p>
              <p>- They can take EWL at Buona Vista but cannot do so at Kent Ridge. Even if they're taking CCL, they can still board at Buona Vista instead of Kent Ridge, and additional traveling time on sv 200 is insignificant (unless there's traffic jam). For the direction towards Bishan/Dhoby Ghaut, it doesn't make much difference; for the direction towards HarbourFront, the demand is not so high.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, some areas inside rivervale drive and rivervale crescent are not covered by LRT. Furthermore, sbs 371 is more convenient to them. They have guaranteed seats. Much better to jostle with huge crowds at sengkang LRT platforms for those places where both LRT and Sbs 371 serve. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

At Toh Guan Rd, 2 DDs bunched together with one fully seated (with some standees), and the other one 75% seated; some time later another Citaro passed by quite packed (Surprisingly, after this Citaro exited Tog Guan Rd East, there are still at least 20 pax waiting at the bus stops there - were they unable to board or are they still unaware of sv 41's route?)</div>

This may not be so high but I think it's good enough, given that it provides unique links and benefit the residents in many ways</div>

By the way, sv 189 has very low loading from Clementi MRT to Clementi Ave 1 during evening peak, only 11 pax onboard a bendy after Clementi MRT</div>
