              <p>103 will have a good loading. Givent that it calls at stops right outside MRT... you can expect people to opt for 103 than 806 to travel to Yishun ave 11.. It is a trade-off between waiting for bus v/s walking time to temp interchange. </p>
              <p>If 103 comes first for sure, people will want to board it if they are taking MRT... if transferring to other bus then depending on which sv will prefer 103 or 806.</p>
              <p>Not that 806 loading will drop because with new stop along st 31 and more occupancy on ave 6 and ring road flats, even 03 min frequency on 806 is not enough many times.</p>

              <p>Observed 161 has more than 80 pax on some buses.. but it also because bus gets delayed within WRI itself with the bendies waiting at stops... other buses at the stop.. this causes 161 to come to stop late... and gets packed... next bus in 03 mins.. gets around 40 pax... this is weekday loading I am talking about.</p>
              <p>On an average... 161 number of buses good enough... unless LTA wants loading per bus to be lower... on average 60 pax per bus leaving WRI... 168 is higher with on average 70 pax per bus leaving WRI. </p>

              Sorry for spamming, but I'm just going to post a series of random loading analysis I did during my joyride today. It's public holiday off-peak so they are low and may not reflect the true loading during peak hours, but at least they can show the loading pattern at least during weekends and PH.
              
              Loading on svc 34 (SBS6239R) from Changi Airport PTB2 at 10.44am, on 1st June 2015 (Public Holiday)
              Changi Airport PTB2 - 27
              Airport Blvd - 27, (-1) 26
              Tampines Ave 7 - (-7+3) 22, (-1+3) 24
              Tampines Ave 2 - (-14+3) 13, (-1+5) 17, (-2+3) 18, (-5+4) 17 
              Tampines Ave 5 - (+6) 23, (+5) 28, (-1+5) 32, (+1) 33, (+8) 41
              Tampines Ave 10 - (-2) 39, 39, (-1) 38, 38, (-16+13) 35
              TPE - (-8+2) 29
              Punggol Rd - (-4) 25, 25
              Punggol Ctrl - (-1+1) 25
              Punggol Temp Int - (-25) 0
              
              - Most pax at the airport alight at Tampines Ave 7 and 2, indicating very few people take 34 to Tampines West and Punggol; many of these people alighted in Tampines East seem to be airport staff so they may have chosen Tampines as a nearby residential town
              - Contrary to my observation last time (when a lot of pax used 34 as an Townlink service between Ave 5 and Ave 2), this time the loading is clear cut: Airport -&gt; Tampines East, Tampines -&gt; IKEA, Tampines -&gt; Punggol, IKEA -&gt; Punggol
              - On the other hand, the bus stop at the very west of Tampines Ave 5 (between Ave 8 and Ave 10) is ready (but shielded), and the road expansion is also completed, so what are they waiting for?
              
              Loading on svc 386 at 11.45am
              Punggol Temp Int - 1
              Punggol Ctrl - 1, (-1) 0
              Edgefield Plains - 0 (386 on the opposite side had 10-15 pax), 0

              <p>Sorry for spamming, but I’m just going to post a series of
              random loading analysis I did during my joyride today. It’s public
              holiday off-peak so they are low and may not reflect the true
              loading during peak hours, but at least they can show the loading
              pattern at least during weekends and PH.</p>

              <p>- Most pax at the airport alight at Tampines Ave 7 and 2,
              indicating very few people take 34 to Tampines West and Punggol;
              many of these people alighted in Tampines East seem to be airport
              staff so they may have chosen Tampines as a nearby residential
              town<br> - Contrary to my observation last time (when a lot of pax used 34
              as an Townlink service between Ave 5 and Ave 2), this time the
              loading is clear cut: Airport <del>&gt; Tampines East, Tampines
              -&gt; <span>IKEA</span>, Tampines -&gt; Punggol,
              <span>IKEA</span> -&gt; Punggol<br></del> On the other
              hand, the bus stop at the very west of Tampines Ave 5 (between Ave
              8 and Ave 10) is ready (but shielded), and the road expansion is
              also completed, so what are they waiting for?</p>

              <p>Wow... that's a lot of traveling you did in one day... good stamina... would have been more useful if you did peak hour weekday loading analysis... loading on 386 makes me laugh especially between Waterway and Punggol East... I had same observation... that full loop from Waterway to Punggol East had only 4 pax.</p>
