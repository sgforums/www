              <p>bro i beg to differ on your statement especially during evening peak hours from 6pm to 8pm. All the seats are chopped by the people who boarded at PS bus stop. Very hardly you will find any seat even at the YMCA bus stop with the MAN Lion buses. That's why you see a lot of smart people choose to board at PS Bus stop for Sv972.</p>

              <p>Sv 700 don't need so many DDs... 6 DDs, 12 SDs is good enough. Agree with other two.</p>

              <p>But now days 700 has become more of service for Petir residents as BPJ ring residents use 972 (who would earlier use LRT/920/922 and change to 700). BPJ road have option bet 190 and 700. Seen 700 loading suffer... Not as high as used to be.</p>

              <p>The load prob come from bt panjang road blk 604 bus stop, where commuters got the choice of 190 and 700 headings to orchard. If 700 go back to the new interchange, think 190 will suffer again, 700 load may drop. May drop, dont shoot me.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, not many will choose 972 at that bus stop cos merry go around in bt panjang b4 heading BKE N PIE. Save money n time, only ppl living inside will take 972. Interesting to see ppl running up n down that bus stops (opp blk 183 and bus stop at blk 604) catching 922 n 972 due to LTA solid planning.</p>

              <p>Not assuming. It's real observation. Have seen even SDs during peak hours easily managing loads... This wasn't the case a year back.. Also 700 had 15 buses 2.5 years back.. Since then it got BSEP/non-BSEP fleet add. You need to also consider back then 972 didn't have DDs, was a new service. 190 fleet also didn't have DDs. Situation has improved a lot and I think where it is relevant, we need to applaud LTA for good efforts on this sector. </p>

              <p>One reason would be that most people realize it is the last stop before 972 loops around to head back to BPJ and that it'll be empty as everyone heading towards town from BPJ would've probably alighted which means there will be so many empty seats available if you board from plaza sing.</p>

              yes. clearly, many of us here agree that even if all the 201 ADL are deployed, there is still not enough ADDs. so best is SMRT should quickly order production batches of the A95. in this way, 2 different manufacturers release new buses in batches would help double-up the time to intro more ADDs on the roads.

              <p>Just to your point, I feel it is impossible for SMRT to win the tender given services lik 78, 79, 143, 183, 285, 334 just cannot survive without DDs and if you total these DDs + the other BBT services under package, SMRT will fall short big time.</p>

              <p>I guess everyone seemed to have forgotten that under the new tendering system, the PTO does not need to own those asset. So in actual fact, there is no pressure on SMRT to procure new fleet to secure the tenders that are up for grabs.</p>
