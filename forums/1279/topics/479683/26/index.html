              I havent see any trunk svc that got 78 paxs from Int..Usually 2 bus stops.
              SMRT commuters are smart..if they see a SD half only would board and half take SBST svc along e way..But if they see high cap buses they will surely board it!

              <p>That's not true. 334 almost every bus gets 90+ pax from interchange. 72 for AM peak between 08 and 09am gets 80+ pax on almost every bus. Same is the case for all JIS services AM peak and sv like 198 in PM peak at Boon Lay. 78 during AM at JE also 80+ pax every bus. The list can go on... but yes I did not expect 106 to get so many pax at interchange itself.</p>

              <p>Many buses were stuck in the peak hour jam this evening due to 13-vehicle pile-up accident @ PIE near TPY, major jam stretched from TPY to Bt. Batok and so on... Only 1 lane passable...</p>
              <p>One of my friend onboard a DD was stucked in the jam for more than an hr... Just for 1 hr, the DD only moved from BKE-to-PIE Exit to Lornie along PIE while heading towards TPY direction... </p>
              <p>966 frequency stretched up to more than 40 mins...</p>

              <p>So I tell BA that I am checking 222/222P loadings at Chai Chee PM peak towards Bedok for this week. While I am supposed to submit it on Friday, I decide to post the findings of the first two days first (I am on OT today and didn't took 222/222P)</p>
              <p>Mon: WEG 222 comes first at 1822 at Ping Yi bus stop, about 30+ pax board it. After Technopark and Blk 26, lower deck was mostly full with standees, while I did not check upper deck. 222P was nowhere to be seen, probably left before 222</p>
              <p>Tues: 222P comes first at 1818 at Ping Yi bus stop, about 30 - 35+ pax board it. 5 stayed behind, probably for 222. At Bedok MRT, bus terminates with about 45 - 55 pax (nearly fully seated coach + about 7 standees). WEG 222 was right behind with about 40+ pax.</p>
              <p>Wed: Didn't took the bus</p>
              <p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>* Heavy loading for sv 101 at stop outside HG Interchange continues. Also saw many people alight at HG Ave 8, <strong>who also have the option of sv 161 but still prefer to choose 101??</strong></p>
              <p>* One of the other reasons for popularity of sv 101 is that there were 45 pax who were still there in the bus who had boarded before HG MRT stop... since 101 is one of the only services that goes on Upper Serangoon rd beyond interchange from hg ave 8, I guess it is very popular</p>
              <p>* I anticipate 1 more DD slot in near future... and with more flats along Buangkok Link either  101M will be introduced or more DDs in future to this service.</p>

              <p>188/963/190/960 other services that have needed more high capacity buses for very long time but have not got any.</p>

              <p>On top of it services like 167/980 can also do well with 2-3 peak hour DDs as these buses in the peak direction also crowded. With TSL this will go though.</p>

              alternatives</p>
              <p>966 always been issue.. only service connecting far west to the
              east... popular during peak hours.</p>
              <p>Even 985 barely surviving with rigids during peak. You should
              see PM peak at Boon Keng MRT... bus already gets packed to door
              between 6pm and 7pm... where place for anyone else to board on
              further stops???</p>
              <p>188/963/190/960 other services that have needed more high
              capacity buses for very long time but have not got any.</p>
              <p>Same goes for 851/854/857.</p>
              <p>On top of it services like 167/980 can also do well with 2-3
              peak hour DDs as these buses in the peak direction also crowded.
              With TSL this will go though.</p>
              <p>So yes... people in SMRT areas have suffered a lot but
              thankfully good days are here!!</p>

              <p>Haha...Took 3512E 969 at around 7pm towards Tampines, bus seems to have good demand there, EVEN though the front bus was a bendy(1134Z). It bunch with 1134Z along Gambas. </p>
              <p>The problem with 969 commuters is that they do not want to stand :/</p>
              <p>985 should get some bendy as a temporary perm first while the production ADL replaces the retiring bendy.</p>

              <p>Imagine traveling on a rigid on 969. In peak hours, you will have 60-65 pax board at Tampines Interchange. 30-35 pax have to stand all the way upto Khatib, where some people will alight. Of course, there will be many who will wait for another 969 so that they get place to sit.</p>
              <p>Others who are getting late, will still take it and stick it out, complaining, fuming about SMRTs 969 when they see 168/161 zooming with all people getting a seat. </p>
              <p>Hence, from SMRT side, it needs to upgrade both its bendy and rigid slots to DDs. </p>
              <p><strong>985 is another service that is long overdue for high capacity buses.</strong> Surely, people will use MRT than stand all the way along PIE to get back home. </p>

              <p>No one will take 39 from Tampines to Yishun. All Yishun bound commuters board either at Loyang or along Pasir Ris Dr 1. Others simply will choose 969 or take 168 and transfer to 39/858 at Jalan Kayu.</p>
              <p>Hence, even if 39 in future is modified to terminate at CBP or UEC, it will not hurt commuters. </p>
