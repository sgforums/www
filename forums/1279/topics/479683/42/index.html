              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Not true. Take 315 you
                  will know. The loading is for Serangoon North Ave 1 and for Chomp
                  Chomp. There are huge number of HDBs along North Ave 1 and some of
                  them are far from YCK road. These are the people who take 315 not
                  because it is a feeder but because it is the only convenient
                  option. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">That's why my
                  recommendation was 116 should do Serangoon North Ave 1 as well and
                  that will improve its loading by a great extent and all these 4
                  additional BSEP on 315 would not have been needed. This is a major
                  mistake that LTA did in 116's route planning.</p>

              <p>tbh 116 should be renamed Svc 71 then extend to Ang Mo Kio - Hougang. Would be a great relief to Sv 73 also.</p>

              <p>Actually SBST can hand 317 to SMRT then run it as busplus like Svc 825. SBST has already handed most of their premium svcs to private operators already. Not many ppl go beyond Serangoon Gdns for 317. With some rich ppl parking their car illegally, it makes it difficult for a 12m bus to manoeuvre.. Like the recent Sv 140 and Sv 158 case.</p>
              <p>How come no 315P? </p>

              <li>all of 187 original loading "recycles" by the time the bus is

              <p>meanwhile, 180 loading is even lower. it is only high during
              certain periods. one reason is because there is only a few groups
              of people using it. in the late morning, sometimes a bendy on 180
              can be relatively empty with only a few people.</p>

              <p>My suggestion is when you do loading analysis to try and take at least 75-80% of the route to know why a high capacity bus is deployed. 180 has crazy loading during peak hours. It also depends on where you see.</p>

              <p>now have one at the front and one at the middle, so if want install third door, it's at the back.</p>
              <p>the concern is really how much the capacity will be affected should we have a third door. apparently, third door also comes with second staircase...</p>
              <p>apparently three door two staircase dd is still rare in the world... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Routemaster">but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">based on the new london routemaster</span></strong></a>, prescribed capacity is only 80. which means maximum (95%) it can carry only 76... the length is 11.23m, but really, 77cm does not make any difference, right?</p>
              <p>say it is 12m and it carries 76 people.. "density" would be 6.33/m. that would be the same as two Single Deck buses coupled together... might as well couple two Single Deck buses, right? somemore two SDs would have four doors, one more door for alighting.. also better, right?<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>so maybe having three doors and two staircase is not a good idea after all....</p>
              <p>even if only three doors, ... okay... maybe if only have the three doors, no second staircase, then only will it be better than the current DD...</p>

              <p>If this was recorded today at 7:50am, it is obvious the loading was low. On a Sunday morning, many people are still sleeping.</p>
              <p>For the most accurate recordings, the best time to record loadings of buses is during peak hours, between Monday and Thursday. That is usually when buses experience the highest loadings and usually, the recordings best represent travel patterns and which bus stops are the most utilised.</p>
