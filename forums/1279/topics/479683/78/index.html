              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the number of people from edgefield plains end to Punggol field (Punggol plaza) drops already. This is somehow affected because 'xi duo fu'-owned by koufu, giant (24 hrs) have opened at edgefield plains. Another crowd puller, singapore pools has also opened inside giant express! So residents have sort of stopped going to Punggol plaza as coffeeshop, supermarket and singapore pools have all opened at Blk 671 edgefield plains. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi Mr. SBS6750E,</p>
              <p>Guess that's pretty normal since the Lavender - Orchard stretch is duplicated by bus 7 that has much better frequency than 175 (8-13mins vs ~15-25mins). The loading for 175 is better during peak periods when workers leave the Kallang Bahru Industrial Estate for town area, but I guess the frequency is the biggest turn off and people will choose to take MRT to get to Bugis/Orchard areas from Kallang/Lavender instead of waiting up to 20 mins for 175. </p>
              <p>Has anyone observed the loadings of 175 from Town - Clementi area before instead? Since its the only route linking Depot Road to Town area, is there better loading along that stretch? Cheers!</p>

              <p>- As expected, didn't see crash loading on any services as it's already past peak hour. But 83 in both directions, 3 and 34 towards Tampines still have good loading.</p>
              <p>- Note how Premium 593 (to CBP) have such high loading (with pax standing) despite the presence of 118 at Punggol. Guess it still takes some time for them to change their travelling patterns?</p>

              <p>Hi Mr. SBS6465E,</p>
              <p>Understand your frustration with the lack of bus services in
              Frankel area as I often frequent there too. However I often head to
              the end nearer to east coast road where it's still walkable to more
              services such as 10,12 etc. However, I feel that it's pretty
              difficult to plan routes serving the entire Frankel estate (other
              than tweaking bus 42, which is hard due to the fact that many more
              inaccessible areas will be affected). I feel that it's probably due
              to the assumption that people staying along Frankel will commute
              via car/taxi as the pathetic frequency of 32 (could wait up to
              25mins if suay) can frustrate people hugely.</p>
              <p>Also, proposing an alternative route (say from Eunos) will not
              be really viable either since you'll only get the link FROM
              kembangan and not TO kembangan from frankel.  </p>
              <p>I guess the only way to get about the poor transport links about
              the estate would be to appeal for an improved frequency for 32 (say
              during peak timings), I believe for 40 as well, in order to cater
              to the needs for commuters who still ply via public transport. Just
              sharing my two cents worth. Cheers!</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Shoot to LTA before. They don't want to enhance 32 because of low ridership. Understandable, seeing as 32 is duplicated by other services throughout its route, with the exception of the Frankel sector. Sadly, we are the sacrificial cows. That is why I've been proposing a new service between Eunos, Marine Parade &amp; Kembangan, that would provide 2-way connection to Kembangan MRT, plus new links for Kembangan estate to Marine Parade which is extremely difficult to get to via bus now. </p>
              <p>10, 12 &amp; 14 can go to town and points along UEC/Tanah Merah, not much use other than that. Can take quite a while to get into town due to traffic - approx. 45 mins including walk out to bus stop. Despite having to change trains in some instances, MRT is still quicker. Plus it serves more points around the island. </p>
              <p>As promised, did loading schedule for 42. AM Peak so far.</p>
              <p>22/02/16 (0814 departure, previous bus 0802) </p>
              <p>Siglap Dr - 22pax. (+3), 25 pax. (+7)</p>
              <p>Frankel Av - 32 pax (-1, +2), 33 pax (0), 33 pax (0)</p>
              <p>Jln Kembangan - 33 pax.</p>
              <p>So Frankel estate total contribution - 12/33. </p>
              <p>I can bet you PM will have much fewer pax going from station. </p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, sbs 117 and sbs 118 are not long distance route bus services to begin with. Moreover, there is nothing wrong to introduce sbs 324 and 386. They have already informed initially that new towns and those new roads with new HDBs will get bulk of the BSEP introduction for new services. 324 and 386 are practically running on new roads. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Hi mr busanalyser, objective is totally different. Sbs 324 main purpose is to connect those roads with new HDB estates in outskirts of Hougang and condos in upper serangoon road to Hougang Mrt. Timing of bus service sbs 324 is as late as 12.30am after midnight primarily to serve residents. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Sbs 102 main objective is to provide another bus service for residents of sengkang west to link up to sengkang and buangkok mrt. Another main purpose is to extend to seletar aerospace park in future once it is getting more developed. The timing is only up to 11.30pm. </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">And of course, if you keep linking loadings to new bus services (which is fine to me), you will start to face dilemma along the way. Cheers. Thanks.</span></p>
