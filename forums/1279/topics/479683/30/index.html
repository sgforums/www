              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">* Service can be potentially extended to Punggol Interchange given parallelism with sv 856.

              <p>Observations:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">* 334 outbound journey still has super high loading... but you can see that most JE boarding pax already alighted along JE and JW Ave 1... and there were few more who boarded along these for st 42.. </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">Safe to assume that sv 49 is taking most of the MRT crowd now for st 42? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">* Inward journey loading was quite poor at around 30 pax, peaking at 37 pax... </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">Could it be that the DD that went 8 mins before might have bunched with this with a gap of say 2-3 mins... or maybe the loading on return leg is not high as typical for most feeder services</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">* I feel LTA should give a BSEP addition (B9TL) to sv 334 considering that even after sv 49 introduction, loads continue to be super high... </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">From SBST side, should definitely convert the lone KUB to DD as well... since the loading demands it... full fleet DD feeder service. </span></p>

              <p>Compassalve Rd -- 45 (0/5)* <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>I alighted here. </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">IMO, 965 is generating excellent revenue for SMRT considering it has a high number of pax taking it, and loading/unloading is quite high throughout. If you see the average until I alighted, the lowest number of pax was <strong>38</strong> pax just before Sengkang Interchange, but on average had 50+ pax between Yishun/Woodlands sector &amp; 40+ pax between Lentor &amp; Sengkang sector.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Note: This observation was in opposite direction of peak rush. I believe the 17.45-19.15 hours from Sengkang to Woodlands would be having packed buses reaching 70pax, and maybe the 2 BSEP DDs that may replace the BSEP MANs can be timed to do this timing from Sengkang.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Nevertheless loading pretty impressive throughout, and BC also drove bus very well and fast, stopping appropriately &amp; courteously for passengers along the way. </span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">123/123M just doing fine. There is heavy loading between Tiong Bahru and Bukit Purmei but well supplemented with full day 123M. No need for DDs or additional buses. 123 loading between Tiong Bahru and Queensway quite okay (30-45 pax most times, hardly exceeds this but can also be in mid 20s on many buses). </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">You know the tendency.. if bus is late.. everyone cram into first bus even if next bus right behind.. during PM peak these days you have 123/123M every 05-07 mins at Tiong Bahru MRT... and everyone can get bus unlike before 123M was introduced.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Also extension of 123/123M to Harbourfront has prompted many ppl to shop at Vivocity and not just TB Plaza. All those who would go to Tiong Bahru to take Green line to change to Purple or Yellow line, now directly take bus to Harbourfront. This has also changed the loading dynamics quite a bit. </p>

              <p>I am surprised PTO reply to you is insufficient service. It is the low hanging branches along Tehlok Blangah/Depot road because of which 195 cannot have DDs, otherwise this service would have got DDs long time back.</p>
              <p>121 was introduced to alleviate the loads on 195 and I would say it has helped to some extent, coz you can see 121 getting 50-60 pax during peak hours, which is very good for new service.</p>
              <p>During PM, it is a bit of challenge, coz you need to take 121 from stop along TB Plaza. Considering 195 comes more often, more ppl flock to 195 stop instead of 121 stop.</p>
              <p>The entire Tehlok Blangah/Henderson stretch has some of the high loading services lik 145/176/195/131/57 that cannot get DDs due to the trees there. Considering how much issue LTA is having to trim down trees along Bukit Timah stretch to make way for DDs on 67/960, I doubt they will get into the marathon exercise in Tehlok Blangah estate. People here have to live without DDs.</p>
              <p>On a positive note, if you see the number of new routes/extensions in this area are quire remarkable compared to other areas.</p>
              <p>123M introduced</p>
              <p>123 extended</p>
              <p>124 extended</p>
              <p>120 introduced</p>
              <p>121 introduced</p>
              <p>Very few estates have got so much bus enhancement. That is their way of compensating for lack of DDs. </p>

              <p>I see, I see, I hardly take a bus from Tamp Int during PM peak
              nowadays. I know 969 normally have high loads, but I didn't expect
              that many buses within a short span of time. Guess I learn
              something today.</p>

              <p>It is normal. If u think 969 is like dat. U shld really go to town and have a taste of 190, In 10 mins only 5-7 buses can appear at one go, 3-4 buses will be fully packed to the door. the last few bus will be crowded</p>

              <p>But if you observe at Tampines interchange, you don't see a 969 scheduled every 03-04 mins. The 969 berth also has other services. Normally, 969 buses depart every 05-07 mins during PM peak.</p>
              <p>What BIAT observed is a bus every 02 mins which I don't think is very normal. The earlier buses could have arrived late to Tampines, so they all left interchange within 02-03 mins of each other.</p>
              <p>On 190, I agree you can see a bus every 02-03 mins... but that ios scheduled.</p>

              <p>Haiya 3-4 or 5-7 mins, dont need to be so calculative or precise lah, as long as there is bus come fast then just board it lah. </p>
              <p>If come after 3 mins then good for u and myself lor. At least i can get a seat on a bus and sleep off my trip home. </p>
              <p>When people tired from school or work, nobody cares about to observe and count the minutes of buses frequency. Even i dont do that, if my 858 comes 5 mins after i missed the bus, then its good for me ah although it is not normal.</p>
