              <p>According to me, these 2 services should definitely not call at this bus stop.</p>
              <p>If 168 is calling, it covers 27 route till Tampines Ave 5, those going to CGA have a faster option with 858. 27 is already bursting and LTA has not taken any steps to put DDs on its SWT as well. I don't understand why LTA/SBST has an issue with putting DDs on SWT of 27, when it can put DDs on SWT of 13A.</p>
              <p>88 also is totally packed. There is an option of people to use many other services to Pasir Ris or Punggol road.</p>

              <p>Yes. 88 should skip. </p>
              <p>27 should skip too. </p>
              <p>On the contrary I think 969 would stop there. Same goes for 858. 969 stop there obvious is to snatch business from 27.</p>
              <p>Remember, to these companies, profit comes first. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, please do not link loading with bus routes to stop at TPE bus stop. They are two different matters altogether. Sbs 88 creates direct link for Punggol residents to pasir ris drive 3 upper portion. Sbs 27 creates direct link to tampines ave 9. The same goes true for reverse direction for sengkang residents. Sbs 27 and sbs 88 are loaded but at certain times of the day, they still have enough spaces for people to board. Anyway we shall know the answers very soon!</p>

              I'm quite concerned if the buses are going to get stuck in the traffic bottleneck as the new bus-stops are located along the expressway slip roads which tend to be clogged up badly. also more and more residential units at SK &amp; PGL are going to be completed over the next few years and will worsen the situation. i dont think the expanded slip roads are able to take the traffic volume.

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, please do not link loading with bus routes to stop at TPE bus stop. They are two different matters altogether. Sbs 88 creates direct link for Punggol residents to pasir ris drive 3 upper portion. Sbs 27 creates direct link to tampines ave 9. The same goes true for reverse direction for sengkang residents. Sbs 27 and sbs 88 are loaded but at certain times of the day, they still have enough spaces for people to board. Anyway we shall know the answers very soon!</p>

              <p><br>Yes, but I would not increase the stopping time on these two services. Sv 27 cannot take more pax. There is sv 168 to Tampines Ave 9 with DDs. Did you miss that? On the other hand to Sengkang, there is sv 89, did you miss that as well? Now you want to provide multiple options also for that one stop?</p>
              <p>Sv 88 to Pasir Ris Dr 3.. this is funny because residential to residential.. why would there be many people alighting at these stops? If they want to transfer they can do it at first stop after TPE or Punggol Rd to many other services.</p>
              <p>Anyway, again a case of poor planning, if you just blindly make all services call at a stop. What LTA will do is add 1 BSEP bus on 27 and 88. Then it thinks its job is done. That's not how planning is done.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busAnalayser, I never miss any. As per passenger practice, they will always take the first bus which comes to their destination. Providing multiple bus services is not a new issue. I know sbs 27 is crowded. But still, there will still be spaces at times of the day for people to board. </p>
              <p>Sbs 88 to pasir ris drive 3 upper portion. Nothing funny. Considered new link. The purpose is not to have so many people alighting at these stops at pasir ris drive 3. One of the most important objectives of building bus stops at TPE is to further improve the bus situations for Punggol and sengkang residents. This is to convenience residents there. They understand that not all services can go inside and loop at Punggol and sengkang. So it is much more practical to get services to bypass these 2 estates and give a bus stop on the outskirts. This should be a win-win situation right?</p>
              <p>Naturally, bus routes which go along the TPE bus stop must stop at it, right? You cannot possibly plan sbs 27 and sbs 88 to skip them. Later some other people want sbs 858 not to stop. Then others want sbs 39 not to stop, saying very crowded. Another guy wants smrt 969 not to stop, saving Punggol guys can take sbs 34 to tampines and sengkang guys can take sbs 27. Then another guy says sbs 89 is very crowded at peak hours in morning. They want faster journey to loyang industrial estate. In the end, each and every person do not want their bus service to stop. May as well cancel off the project. This should really not be the way.

              <p>Hi mr sbs 3688Y, I think will not in the long run. Firstly, the roads are expanded when they add the bus stops. Secondly, most of the cars will use the direct flyover. Only cars turning into sengkang and Punggol will use the slip roads. Thirdly, we do not expect huge crowds of people at the TPE stops. Even though there are more residential units coming up, some of the passengers may have taken bus services originating from roads inside sengkang and Punggol. They do not have to depend on the bus services at TPE bus stops all the time. For those residents living just besides or within waking distance of the TPE stops and having no cars of their own, congrats to them. It will be like an MRT to them! Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes the bus stop is very long. There are about 10 glass panels to put all the bus information. They are divided into 5 different sections of 2 panels each. So you really can expect all the bus services plying there to stop. Most bus stops in other areas have just 2 glass panels. So you can roughly imagine for those who never really see the bus stops.
