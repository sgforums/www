              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, it is not only loading that counts for a bus service especially BSEP. Sometimes extension is done to facilitate many other reasons and direct connection. I saw many children boarding sbs 386 at bus stop outside Blk 162B Punggol central taking 1 bus stop to horizon primary school at 7 to 7.30am every weekday. Sometimes I saw crowds of 10 taking sbs 386 at edgefield plains to Punggol plaza bus stop. At times, I saw 2 adults taking few bags of groceries boarding sbs 386 at plaza stop and alighting at Punggol drive oasis bus stop. I also saw some working class adults boarding bus at Horizon primary school bus stop towards mrt in the morning. It is perceived as more convenient as the stop is just outside the flats. Take note that not all will want to walk to oasis LRT or kadaloor LRT as their flats are in middle. Yes the loading for the extension is not much. But it does serve the purpose well for this extension. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I do know that there are few people who do use the service. I also spotted some 7 people board at Edgefield Plains to get down at Punggol Plaza. But to be honest the rational for extension of 386 IMO is different.</p>
              <p>If having door step stop is what it is then the end flats on Edgefield and Edgedale plains should have had a service long back, as the walk to LRT is quite far.</p>
              <p>LTA had promised a new service in Punggol. There was a strong rumor of a Punggol / Tampines service back then. Somehow the plans fell through maybe bcoz of limited slots at Tampines Int. As a quick fix, IMO 386 was extended. I feel 386 route might get amended at a later date to serve Waterway flats at Edgedale plains end when they will be ready in Q2 2016. Once that happens 386 loading will sore.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalayser, it won't be extended. Another new feeder service will have to come in. If you extend sbs 386 again for edgedale plains near waterway flats to go direct to mrt/bus interchange, then the bus stop outside Greendale primary school will be invalidated. There will be no bus service at this stop. Maybe even the two stops at horizon primary school and opposite horizon primary school will also have no bus. It is very unlikely that LTA will build 3 bus stops for sbs 386 and then remove the bus service and leave the 3 bus stops 'a white elephant'. </p>
              <p>Moreover, LTA mindset is if once a bus service is amended, it will definitely introduce another service for an alternative method if it takes away that bus service for that route. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Firstly, 386 extension is not a replacement for 164. 386 was extended before 164 rumour came in. It was just when 164 failed to introduce then LTA decided to use 386 as a 'new' service.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I believe 386 extension is not only to provide doorstep service for Edgedale Plains. It should be for Waterway residents to go to Punggol East Plaza. Maybe there eere complaints from residents or MP pressure.</p>

              <p>Only 1/3 DDs is on a good slot.. the one you took is the one I see coming back to Lor 1 around 7.15pm I guess. This one usually leaves Lor 1 around 4.30pm and next trip is around 7.30pm.</p>
              <p>SMRT/LTA did the same when 972 was launched with 3 DDs out of its fleet of 15 DDs back then... First bus did Orchard loop around 5pm with all 3 DDs deployed back to back... By 530pm all 3 DDs have already crossed Orchard (not its peak time)... but then they come back again around 730pm and 930pm to do their next trips... So basically LTA/SMRT just maximised the DDs that were deployed... though they didn't really do the 5.30-7pm super peak time. All DD deployment was outside of the peak hours. </p>
              <p>I see it is the same case with 985 currently bcoz there are 2 DDs that leave CCK around 5.30pm and 6pm, while I thought it would have made sense to make these 3 depart from Lor 1 between 5.30 and 6.30pm. </p>

              <p>I caught the 6p.m. trip from CCK yesterday... I remember that the 2 ex-BSEP SDs used to leave Lor 1 Ter at around 5 - 5.30p.m. (back to back), but it seems that after they upgraded to DDs, they changed the timings of the BSEP slots. I suspect that the buses leaving Lor 1 Ter at around 5 - 5.30p.m. are now regular SDs... Wonder why they changed the timings after upgrading to DDs?</p>

              <p>I think 961 is doing okay... The route is so long that by the time it starts in peak, it is already off-peak during its journey... 961 also has many other options along its way, so IMO fleet is doing okay.</p>
              <p>972 is doing perfect with 24 DDs... operating at frequency of 04-05 mins... if there is no bunching, each bus easily gets 60-70 pax... can expect this only to increase with the new flats in Senja/Segar opened this quarter.</p>
              <p>190 needs to cut 2 buses... which should be SDs.. around 10-12 SDs are spammed on sv 190... totally uneccessary... frequency right now is operating at 03-04 mins... managing loading very well... will say DDs take around 80-90 pax peak on each bus... a tad higher than 190</p>
              <p>700 can lose its 2 bendies... totally not  required... loading on 700 still better during AM but PM has lost loading considerably... Most buses have around 50-60 peak loading. </p>
              <p>985 should be a fleet of 6 DDs, 10 SDs... and for GOD sake deploy the DDs at the right time, which SMRT is not doing right now.</p>
