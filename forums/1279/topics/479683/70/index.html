              <p>Different areas have peak loading at different times.</p>
              <p>BPJ/CCK area it would be from 7-8.15am. Evening high peak is from 6pm to 7.30pm but if you observe from 530pm-6pm and 7.30-7.45pm also you should get pretty decent loads in BPJ/CCK area for feeders/short trunks. Before and after that loading drops sharply. </p>

              <p>972 is operating 28 buses with 1 A22 as back up.</p>
              <p>I feel fleet may stabilize around 27 DDs even after DTL2, as if you see major loading for 972 comes from Senja/Segar/Fajar... </p>
              <p>Why would anyone in their right mind do LRT/920/922 --&gt; DTL 2 --&gt; NSL to get to Scotts/Orchard when they can simply do 972. More economical, less hassle, faster. </p>
              <p>The services that have to be modified is sv 67. It won't need as many buses in the DTL2 sector, and smart would be to split it into two services so that the Little India - Tampines section can still have high capacity buses. </p>
              <p>Look at the number of rigids on 983 as well. They for sure will have to upgrade 983 to full DD fleet sooner or later.</p>

              <p>Heh.  Trust me, I know Victorians and how well they love visiting the school in the holidays.  If you go down to the campus on holiday weekdays looking for Victorians, how shall I put it? ... “no need to camp”. Hehe.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I realised my analysis forgot to count St Pat's.  So along the route, we have Tao Nan (future), KC (or is it called something else nowadays), St Pat's, VS and VJC... Mid Jan is good time to monitor loading.</p>

              <p>I feel fleet may stabilize around 27 DDs even after DTL2, as if
              you see major loading for 972 comes from
              Senja/Segar/Fajar... </p>
              <p>Why would anyone in their right mind do LRT/920/922 --&gt; DTL 2
              --&gt; NSL to get to Scotts/Orchard when they can simply do 972.
              More economical, less hassle, faster. </p>
              <p>The services that have to be modified is sv 67. It won't need as
              many buses in the DTL2 sector, and smart would be to split it into
              two services so that the Little India - Tampines section can still
              have high capacity buses. </p>
              <p>Look at the number of rigids on 983 as well. They for sure will
              have to upgrade 983 to full DD fleet sooner or later.</p>

              <p>Loading on 979 (SMB3141S)</p>
              <p>Missed the best timing as I was doing some observations at Bukit Panjang...<br>(Bus that terminated at Bukit Panjang at 7.44am had around 30 pax alighting)</p>
              <p><br>(7:44) Petir Rd - 0<br>(7:45) Jelebu Rd - [+1] 1<br>(7:49) Woodlands Rd - 1, [+3] 4 <br>(opposite 979 had 2 standing, opposite 170 KUB had ~10 standing, opposite 170 Citaro had 5~8 empty seats; 3 mins later, opposite 961 had 5 standing)<br>(7:58) Choa Chu Kang Dr - 4  (opposite 979 had 15~20 standing)<br>(7:58) Choa Chu Kang North 5 - 4<br>(8:00) Choa Chu Kang St 52 - [+17] 21, [+2] 23<br>(8:02) Choa Chu Kang Dr - [-21+2] 4 (Yew Tee MRT)<br>(8:04) Choa Chu Kang North 7 - [+1] 5<br>(8:05) Choa Chu Kang Cres - [+5] 10, [-3+8] 15, [+6] 21 (302 in front), [-1+1] 21<br>(8:07) Choa Chu Kang North 7 - 21<br>(8:10) Choa Chu Kang Dr - [-12+1] 10 (Yew Tee MRT; 302 in front had ~20 pax alighting; 70-80 pax waiting outside MRT entrance)<br>(8:14) Choa Chu Kang St 52 - [-1+2] 11 (opposite 979 had 20-30 pax), 11<br>(8:16) Choa Chu Kang North 5 - [-1+1] 11 (jam, almost bunched with another 979 in front; that bus had no standees)<br>(8:20) Choa Chu Kang Dr - [+1] 12 <br>I alighted here.</p>
              <p>- All 979 buses are rigids unless otherwise stated. Didn't see any HC buses on that day<br>- 979's loading in CCK Cres largely depends on whether 302 has called or not... But still have dedicated pax towards Bukit Panjang.</p>
              <p>(After I alighted, I crossed the road and took 307 to Yew Tee MRT. Of course it was very late but the bus did get 10 pax standing before reaching Yew Tee MRT. Not sure if earlier loading would be high enough to warrant bendies.)</p>

              <p>- Surprising to see so many pax alighting at Boundary Rd<br>- Most pax alight at Hougang Ave 9, maybe because of CCL they alight at Serangoon and take 109 (instead of 72/116 at Hougang).

              <p>PM peak is after 5:30pm, i think they change plans abit. Concession people have 7 hours grace period before adult fares apply (for those concession fare expiring in December 31)</p>
