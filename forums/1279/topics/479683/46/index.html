              <p>Where do you board 850E? This was a loading analysis I did two
              months back. Maybe some pattern has changed since then but since I
              have it on my ipad, i'll share it here.</p>
              <p>Ave 11 - 19 pax</p>
              <p>Ave 6 - 28, 34, 41</p>
              <p>Ring Road - 51, 60, 70 (stop before ave 11. I got down here as I
              had to go for my breakfast meeting in Yishun) </p>
              <p>So 3rd stop on Ring road bus already had 70 pax. If MANA22, no
              chance anyone can board... but for E500 pax on remaining stops
              should have been able to board, unless yours is last stop before
              express to city. </p>

              <p>386 loading v interesting... 0 pax (so you don't count yourself right!?!) </p>
              <p>By the way, 324 has similar loadings.. leaves interchange with 13-15 pax during PM peak for some buses. I wonder what it must be in afternoon and post 8pm. Ever see empty buses on 324.</p>

              <p>Yes you are right. More so after Yishun temp interchange coz it is far from MRT. So definitely people prefer 860 to Khatib now. Hence, those 13 buses and 860A. 806 anyway was bursting beyond its means as well. So now gets more relief in its loading. 803 also doing quite okay. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Haha. News have come out that sbs 85 will be getting double decker buses. Yeah 1 more Punggol service to have DDs. This must be mainly due to increasing population in sengkang west area which heightened the need for DDs. In a way, it helps to alleviate the fact that sengkang west has too few bus services. Sbs 85 has finally seen its heydays that there are not enough loading. By the way, when is sbs 3 turn to have DDs? Cheers.</p></div>

              <p>Hi mr array88, yes this is true. </p>
              <p>Sbs 85 loading is mainly due to few factors.</p>
              <p>---lower frequency than other services thus accumulated many people on 1 bus.</p>
              <p>---peak hour especially high crowds.</p>
              <p>---crowds from Punggol east/Sengkang east/sengkang west</p>
              <p>---blooming number of HDB flats in sengkang west area</p>
              <p>---only 1 bus service at sengkang west way (sbs 85) not counting other nearby roads</p>
              <p>---fastest way from sengkang east/west area to khatib/yishun. </p>
              <p>---at present, LTA still not introducing new bus services to sengkang west way, thinking changing some single deck to double deck for SBS 85 will help.</p>
              <p>---foresee new service will go to sengkang west very soon. </p>
              <p>Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>17.48 - sv 43M - SD - counted 64 pax and then few could not
              board</p>
              <p>17.50 - sv 70 - SD</p>
              <p>17.53 - sv 70 - DD</p>

              <p>17.58 - sv 70 - SD</p>
              <p>** If you see almost every bus is a SD during this time... and
              every bus almost was full packed to door (PTD)</p>
              <p>** The downroute DDs on sv 70 had some bad luck where they came
              always immediately after another 70</p>
              <p>** Almost all buses on sv 70 coming from Shenton Way were
              SDs</p>
              <p>-- My calculation is that post 6pm... most of the DDs will kick
              in on sv 43 and sv 70</p>

              <p>Bro... observation is accurate on that particular day.. as I am looking at the loading at the bus stop... cannot take down the rego number for each bus... but made a note to take down the rego number for downroutes on sv 70.</p>
