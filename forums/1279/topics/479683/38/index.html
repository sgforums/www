              <p>Hi mr array88, this type of conversation will have no final conclusion. One man's meat may be another guy's poison. The authorities will have the final say as they got the records collected from the ezylink data of commuters. When they have the service running and not made any amendments, they have reasons to justify. What we commuters see may only be certain loadings at certain timings and be half the picture only.Â </p>
              <p>When they do planning, they see the whole town and its connection as a whole. No authorities in the world will like to lose $ on a regular basis if a service is running low on commuters day in and day out. When they have such a service, they will look at its threshold limit for basic level of subsistence. Eventually, they will even see if some other bus services will be able to cover up for the 'so called money losing service'. If there is a need to provide that service based on connectivity issues, they will have already done their homework to cover up for this loss. Cheers.</p>

              <p>IÂ happened to beÂ at Anson Rd/Robinson Rd from 6.15pm to 7pm yesterday (4 Mar).</p>
              <p>Some observations: (might not be always true)</p>
              <p>- Premium services generally have good loadings -- that means, regardless of the size of the bus, most premium buses would be almost fully seated by the time they reach the last bus stop along Robinson Rd (opp AIA Twr). (Note: in the following paragraphs, I'll refer to this bus stop as "at Robinson Rd", as most of my observations are from here.)</p>
              <p>On the contrary, City Direct services have poorer loadings and buses are usually onlyÂ half seatedÂ at the same bus stop.</p>
              <p>(Besides the fact that City Direct services are generally quite new, I think this kind of situation is also because of private operators... These services would have done so much better if they are converted to express services run by the PTOs.)</p>
              <p>- Sv 128's loading seems to have increased slightly compared to last year. The second 128 bus was fully seated at Robinson Rd, and of course it will pick up some more pax ain Orchard... Last timeÂ the busesÂ used to be almost empty.</p>
              <p>- Sv 196e actually has good loading... Generally the Citaros will be at least fully seated at Robinson Rd. For yesterday, the third bus, which was a KUB cameoed on 196e, was almost packed to the door and people had difficulty boarding the bus (although it was late by 8 mins)</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I did observe some other services and took photos, but I couldn't quite remember the observation... If you have interest in loadings of certain services, you may ask here and I'll try to recall. Also I'm planning to visit there again a few weeks later, so I may check the requested servicesÂ more thoroughly.</p>

              <p>I typed a long essay just now but it was lost due to a technical
              error... Anyway, my points are:</p>
              <p>1. Sv 18's loading was not bad before Bedok Int opened because
              of the bus stop at Bedok town centre. Also many people take 18 from
              Ave 2 towards Tampines during PM.</p>
              <p>2. IMO there have to be some services which may not have good
              loadings but provide unique links/connections.</p>
              <p>3. IMO, not all feeders or services functioning like feeders are
              suitable for DDs: it all depends on the habits of the
              commuters.</p>

              <p>i live along sv 18 route and i have my own thought.</p>
              <p>i wud say sv 18 load depend a lot on if bus come bef or not. sv 18 frequency very bad. only uniqye part is ave 2 in bedok where it is only trunk. rest route full copy of other service.</p>
              <p>got service 8 till safra with better frequency and got sv 168 from safra to bedok. got sv 59 and 28 cover big part of route also.Â </p>
              <p>i not say sv 18 be remove but i want sv 18 to do bedok reservoir view. bto flat there no bus and walk long distance. i got friend who always complain.Â </p>
              <p>i also agree that bus is empty most bet bedok and safra. get more peop from safra nd tamp cc to tamp. also again depend on sv 8 and 38 call time.Â </p>
              <p>can do much better with sv 18 route - u no think so?</p>

              <p>Actually, I think that 18 has better loading prior to its amendment to Nth Ave 2. The stop that 18 skips now currently is the stop that students from Yu Neng, Red Swastika and Bedok Green alight from. So by skipping this stop, ALL the loading ends up being taken by 28.</p>
              <p>Anyone observe school timing loading on this service before?</p>

              <p>yes we are very liberal on our resources. nothing really is a waste here since we have ample of resources. hence, everything seems okay and fine.</p>
              <p>my observation on 116 is quite similar, sometimes a little better than your 17 pax peak loading. The ones I have taken do peak at 23-24 pax along YCK road or HG Ave 9 (if 72 has not called). But yes 17 pax or 24 pax is not really a waste because we have ample of resources to throw around.Â </p>
