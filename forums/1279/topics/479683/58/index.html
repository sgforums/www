              <p>Can kill 173 already. Split it up, with the current 173 going to Bt Panjang after Hume Ave, and a new short trunk from Bt Batok making a loop around Hume Ave / Upp Bt Timah Rd / Hillview Rd.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbs6750E, yes I agree. I am inside the bus on SBS 83 on most evenings. Observed huge crowds even until 8.45pm on weekdays. This is one crucial bus which goes inside Punggol and many people alight at the stops along Punggol field Blk 196A, Blk 173B, Punggol plaza bus stop. As of present, current fleet can still handle demand. No DD is required because it is a short service mainly. People used this bus service for very few stops. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>As for 102 the demand now can say like 324. As for DDs, Ppl dont
              move upstairs and only alight after a few stops. 102's demand i can
              say its only on weekends like sv 84</p>

              <p>Isn't it too early to comment on 102's loading? Also it has not even done one weekend properly to compare it to sv 84 of all... </p>

              <p>sv 83 is operating at around 10-12 mins frequency. If the bus is late to loop @ Sengkang possible to have higher loading bcoz still many people in Punggol area depend on Compass Point and amenities around Sengkang MRT / Kopitiam to get things done. But overall loading has dropped IMO b/w Sengkang and Punggol town.</p>

              <p>Observation of services at <strong>Whitley towards PIE (Toa Payoh direction) from 18.00 - 19.00 hours</strong></p>
              <p>105 - spotted 3 SDs all had some standees (around 45-50 pax on board)</p>
              <p>132 - spotted 4 DDs (2 of which had may be 70-80 pax, one was in the range of 50-60 pax and 4th one that came at 2 minute interval from previous one had around 15-20 pax on board)</p>
              <p>151 - spotted 3 SDs all with few standees (around 40 pax on board)</p>
              <p>153 - buses were quite packed and had many people who alighted at Whitley to transfer to 190/972 (2 DDs seemed to have around 70/80 pax and SD had around 50/60 pax as per my observation)</p>
              <p>154 - mostly SDs came (opp direction were DDs).. most had standing but manageable is what I would say (range of 50-55 pax)</p>
              <p>156 - only two bus came in 1 hour observaton duration and that too had no standees (around 30 pax on board)</p>
              <p>186 - spotted 1 DD and 2 SDs... all 3 buses must have had around 20 pax on board</p>
              <p>** Overall, all buses leading to Toa Payoh direction had modest loading and no issues with loading. 153 to me was surprising that it seemed to have the highest loading among all services that called during that time followed with 132 and 154.</p>

              <p>190 - buses came at an interval of 03-05 minutes (16 buses) with many DDs bunching as well. In the duration I observed, no SD came but I saw 4 SDs in the opposite direction towards NBR. I would say at least 2 DDs were packed to door, where as all others could be in the range of 80-100 pax. 1 bendy that came during the period also was packed to door but had DD right behind that took the pax. So overall 190 is doing great with a high frequency and people are able to board well now. Take note that apart from the frequency, there was not one bus that left Whitley stop without standees.</p>
              <p>700 - spotted 3 SDs in the duration of 1 hour compared to around 16 buses on sv 190. Surprisingly, the buses came to Whitley stop with maybe 40-50 pax on board only. So SDs managed the loading very well. Definitely 972 has tanked its loading. So it is mainly the Petir road residents who take 700 these days. Absolutely manageable with SDs</p>
              <p>960 - spotted only 5 buses in 1 hour duration... that to me seemed very less.. also to note, not even 1 of them was a DD... the 5 buses were 3 bendies and 2 SDs... and all 5 of them had standees but none of them were packed to door. Most buses in opposite direction were DDs towards Marina Center.. I was confused. So are the DDs deployed for Woodlands Road industrial estate towards BPJ to cater to the high loading there? Or maybe it is just the hour I observed didn't have DDs towards WRI... maybe has before 6pm and after 7pm. Also frequency seemed lower than expected but overall no complain because buses were not overly packed. I think also to do with 190/972 alternatives</p>
              <p>972 - spotted around 11 DDs... buses came at frequency of 02-07 mins... Every time the Steven road signal turned green... either a 972 came or 190 or both... 972 loading is lesser than 190 as expected but has on average 60 pax loading.. Most buses were around the range of 55-60 pax loading, there were few that came in after 07 mins that were packed but none packed-to-door. Clearly when you stand at Whitley, you notice that even if 190 or 700 calls, passengers wait for 972 as direct option. Didn't see that with 700 and 960. </p>
              <p>** Overall such a huge improvement to BPJ services. I just can't imagine how the loading was managed before DDs came on 190 and 972... Well done on this sector to manage the loading :)</p>

              <div>-------------------------------------------</div>
              <div>Some other observations at Jln Kayu for 4.50pm to 5.40pm:<br>- Some people are already starting to use 102 to Jln Kayu circus to transfer to other services. I stayed at Jln Kayu for a while, and saw someone alighting from 102 and running towards the eastbound bus stop to catch a 168 bus there towards Bedok. Later saw another person alighting from 102 with a suitcase, and I suspect she's transfering to 858 towards CGA<br>- There are many joyriders on 102...<br>- There are still a lot of people (&gt;15 per bus) taking 103 from SAP to Jln Kayu for transfers, but most are walking towards the eastbound bus stop, while those who remained at northbound stop took either 168 or 86. Guess those heading towards Yishun are already using 103. Surprisingly, a lot of pax board southbound 103 at Jln Kayu, too. <br>- Contrary to some people's belief, there are people transfering to 858 to CGA. Although not a lot.<br>- Seems that 39's loading in both directions still doesn't warrant DDs at least during my period of observation, although some buses have quite a lot of standees. 2 DDs spotted in both directions also had less than 30 pax. Maybe it's too early, though. (During this time period, loading towards Yishun &gt; towards Tampines)<br>- Although 102's sequence was DD-SD-DD-SD... on the first day of introduction, that's not the case today. Spotted 3 SDs after the DD that I took, after which it was a DD.</div>
              <div>- Towards the end of my observations, some buses on southbound 103 can have 50-55 pax or even be almost packed to the door before calling at Jln Kayu bus stop.</div>
              <div>------------------------------------------</div>
              <div>Loading on svc 103 at 5.44pm<br>Jln Kayu - [-1+3?] 10<br>Piccadilly - 10<br>Seletar Aerospace Dr - [+3] 13, [+1] 14, [+6] 20, [+1] 21<br>West Camp Rd - 21, 21, [+12] <strong>33, 33<br></strong>Yishun Ave 1 - <strong>33<br></strong>Yishun Ave 11 - [-12+1] 22, 22<br>Yishun Ctrl - 22, [-6+4] 20 (812 in front; one person wanted to take 812 but chose 103 instead after short conversation with 812 BC)<br>(Two 860 buses bunched up when turning into Yishun Ave 2, with one having 3 standees and one with less than 10 pax onboard)<br>Yishun Ave 2 - 20, [-16] 4 (Yishun MRT)<br>Yishun Temp Int - [-4] 0</div>
              <div>- Generally, the number of pax waiting for 103 towards both directions are comparable (a little bit more towards Serangoon). However frequency of 103 towards Serangoon seems to be inconsistent - maybe this is why I saw packed-to-the-door buses at Jln Kayu<br>- I guess loading in SAP is more evenly distributed in both directions, with 20-25 pax in both directions instead of 40-50 pax all towards Serangoon previously. That may be why it seems that loading "has not picked up"<br>- There are a lot of private buses running around in SAP. Expect loading to increase further when more people switch to public transport<br>- Contrary to expectations (before introduction of 103), most people from YCK Rd still take 854 instead of 103, as shown by less than 10 pax onboard before reaching Jln Kayu roundabout<br>- 806 loading from Yishun to Yishun Ave 11 is still higher than 103... Spotted 103 in opposite direction with 25 pax onboard, and two 806 bunched at the back with one of them 40-45 pax and the other 15-20 pax</div>
              <div>-----------------------------------------------</div>

              <p>@array88 - appreciate if you could post different route loading as separate posts, easier to reply. </p>
              <p>- the time you observed before peak hours is hard to judge whether bus needs high capacity or not as most services during this time have very low loading.</p>
              <p>- 113 loading is typically this way even during peak hours, where the sector from Kovan to Hougang will not see more than 20 pax. It is also the reason why 113 operates with such poor frequency, especially when 113A operates, frequency b.w Kovan and Hougang is bet 20-25 mins per bus</p>
              <p>- The HDB block at Upper Serangoon Crescent is huge apparently. There is also a new one on Upper Serangoon road, equally big just opened up. This will see 102 loading rise in future. 102 too early to do loading check. Maybe 1 month is a good time. also the service was only introduced to public 5 days before launch</p>
              <p>- Natural to have higher loading on 806 to 103... you have 4 806 bendies that will come before one 103</p>

              <p>On 171 - def Yishun to Shenton does not need DDs during peak. Opp direction, 2 DDs is fine if timed correctly. Moreover 171 needs DDs more for AM peak than PM peak.</p>
              <p>169 - It is doing very well with DDs even with my observation. <strong>TIB429E</strong> though keeps complaining about DDs being misfit on 169, which really is not the case.</p>
