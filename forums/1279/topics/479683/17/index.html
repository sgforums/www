There were only 2 Sv 113 buses serving hougang area. This svc could use an additional BSEP bus or even two. 7 buses really not enough for this service. Especially after 7PM, Even at 2100hrs, Sv 113 can be still packed.</p>
              <p>Sv 119 can reduce 1 DD slot to SD slot. No pax bothered to move upstairs.</p>

              <p>Maybe 325 can cut short instead of looping here and there? It is quite ridiculous for a 10min ride to hougang green to become a 20-25min ride. </p>

              <p>Definitely not... 119 goes straight down on upper serangoon rd, 113 will do ave 6, 10, 2 and only then turn to upper serangoon rd... How in the world it is faster??? Don't be so biased to lose all your credibility.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS5010P, i beg to differ. If both buses come at same time, sbs 119 should reach kovan mrt (upper serangoon road) faster. Why you say sbs 113 faster??? Busanalyser is correct. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi both, this is my personal opinion. Many ppl still prefer to take 113 frm ave 8 to kovan station. There are 2 bus stops along hg ave 8 for sv 113. It really depends on which bus comes first. I have seen 113 and 119 reaching kovan station at the same time. You see, my friend lives near ave 6 so transferring to Sv 119 at Punggol park might be a hassle. Why transfer when you have a direct doorstep svc? It depends on personal opinion, really. As for me i dont like transfers. If you dont believe me you can ask the commuters commuting to kovan via hg ave 8.  Sv 113 during off peak is quite fast. From ave 8 to kovan in 10mins.  Even Google Maps and gothere.sg recommends taking sv 113 to kovan from hougang ave 8.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>This case's like sv 62 vs sv 113 from lorong ah soo to hougang. You may think 62 is faster. But nope. Both are the same. Sometimes sv 113 can be faster than sv 62. Sv 113 is always behind sv 62 bunching at hougang. Sometimes sv 62 behind sv 113.  It depends on the human/road traffic, really..</p>

              ave 8 for sv 113. It really depends on which bus comes first. I
              have seen 113 and 119 reaching kovan station at the same time. You
              see, my friend lives near ave 6 so transferring to Sv 119 at
              Punggol park might be a hassle. Why transfer when you have a direct
              doorstep svc? It depends on personal opinion, really. As for me i
              dont like transfers. If you dont believe me you can ask the
              commuters commuting to kovan via hg ave 8.  Sv 113 during off
              peak is quite fast. From ave 8 to kovan in 10mins.  Even
              Google Maps and gothere.sg recommends taking sv 113 to kovan from
              hougang ave 8.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p>This case's like sv 62 vs sv 113 from lorong ah soo to hougang.
              You may think 62 is faster. But nope. Both are the same. Sometimes
              sv 113 can be faster than sv 62. Sv 113 is always behind sv 62
              bunching at hougang. Sometimes sv 62 behind sv 113.  It
              depends on the human/road traffic, really..</p>

              <p>Hi both, this is my personal opinion. Many ppl still prefer to

              <p>Hi mr SBS5010P, now i understand. Have you said your friend lived nearer to ave 6 earlier, then it will be no misunderstanding. So it boils down to a doorstep service (sbs 113) and a walking distance service (sbs 119). Route from hougang ave 6/8 junction to kovan mrt via upper serangoon road is about 500 metres shorter than route via hougang ave 8,10, 2. So logically speaking, sbs 119 should be slightly faster. But with other factors like walking from exact block to bus stop coming into the equation, your friend may be right in choosing sbs 113 which to him is considered faster. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busAnalayser, sbs 119 frequency is neither great. So it is understandable why they will just gladly wait for sbs 113. Furthermore, doorstep is the key. Most people are very practical by nature. They will just wait a while more and will not mind the few minutes if they have the bus by their doorstep. If time is a concern, they will take cab already.

              <p><br>And for the record, sv 119 frequency is much better than sv 113 during am/pm peak hours... sv 113 buses also go to sv 113A and hence 5010P is right that during peak hours in the hougang stretch, the frequency can be 20-25 minutes, but again, there is really not much loading.</p>
              <p>Around 10-15 pax is what sv 113 gets in Hougang area.</p>

              <p>Most commuters are very practical.. Some still take 51 from JE
              to HG even though CCL is much much faster. They are not like us
              where they know which bus to take and which way is
              faster. </p>

              <p>Some ppl don't like 2 transfers via CCL (especially when the linkway between NEL and CCL Serangoon Stations is so long). And when they see "51 Jurong East" at Jurong East Temp Int they may just board it rather than searching for alternative routes towards HG.</p>
              <p>That's why they have to put the "Please use NEL for a shorter journey to DBG" sign at HarbourFront MRT, because some ppl may just go to CCL when they see "(8) to Dhoby Ghaut".  (a bit OT)</p>
