              <p>** Extremely shocking. All buses got &lt;20 pax. I always
              thought 257 had better loading to st 61/62. Also it looks like 243W
              loading also is more after st 62. If it was at st 62, then people
              could have taken 257 also or maybe were stuck in 243W queue. No
              idea but loading seems really bad on 257 between Boon Lay and
              Pioneer.</p>

              <p><strong>972 deserves the 27 DDs and 190 needs more
              DDs.</strong></p>
              <p>Here is the observation from Thu 05/Nov from Whitley road bus
              stop. The way I analyzed is using the app after the bus has left
              Whitley road bus stop. </p>

              <p>18.55 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>
              <p>18.58 - 190 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.01 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.01 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.05 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.07 - 190 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.07 - 190 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.11 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.11 - 972 - DD (red)</p>
              <p>19.11 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.12 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.17 - 190 - DD (red)</p>
              <p>19.17 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.19 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.23 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.25 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.25 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.29 - 190 - DD (red)</p>
              <p>* In a span of 45 mins, following is the observation:</p>
              <p>(190) - (12 buses) - (frequency 03-04 mins) - (7 DDs, 1 BD, 4
              SDs) - (6R, 6Y, 0G)</p>
              <p>(700) - (04 buses) - (frequency 10 mins) - (4 SDs) - (0R, 4Y,
              0G)</p>
              <p>(972) - (08 buses) - (frequency 05-06 mins) - (8 DDs) - (1R, 6Y,
              1G)</p>
              <p>* If you see apart from 1 bus on 972 no other bus had green
              after departing Whitley road bus stop. Also note the fantastic
              frequency. There is a service every 01-02 mins to BPJ town from
              Whitley, and the observations does not include 960. </p>
              <p>* No wonder LTA added another 3 DDs to 972 </p>
              <p>* Now SMRT needs to convert SD-&gt;DD because clearly every SD
              is packed to door. </p>
              <p>* What also amuses me is that people know there will be a bus
              behind, mostly a DD and still are ready to cramp into a SD</p>
              <p>* When 2 buses arrive, people distribute evenly among 2 buses to
              board. In one instance for 972 the latter bus got so full because a
              lot of people alighted from 153/154 and ran to 972 to board. So bus
              in back did not have any more space. </p>
              <p>* Also note, my observation may be at the most prime time; at
              other times buses may not have such high loading.</p>
              <p>* sv 700 had lot of space on every bus. I think loading would be
              around 45-55 pax. Clearly, 972 has taken away 700's loading.</p>

              <p>yes... but the problem is that 972 buses does not do downroute during PM peak... so all 27 buses will be almost empty when travelling to town...you can see 6-7 972 travelling to town in space of 20 mins(almost all are empty)  would rather half of them do downroute directly from dhoby ghaut.... thus cutting some travelling time and enable more trips...</p>

              <p>This I agree. They should operate 14 buses on 972 and 11 buses on 972A. This way can cut 2 buses due to downroute. </p>
              <p>In PM also do same.. have 11 buses start from YMCA and have 14 buses do the full route.</p>
              <p>I don't think LTA really cares about profit right now. Hence, 27 buses have been deployed on 972 to cater to the peak direction loading.</p>
              <p>700 on the other hand did not have many people boarding, though there was a 700 after 10 mins and that too all SDs in the time span I observed. Each bus had enough space compared to all DDs on 190/972 that had at least 80 pax, some even +100</p>

              <p>- Very little boarding / alighting activities at Orchard, I guess because of 190</p>

              (jam)</p>
              <p>Newton Rd - [-22+2] 19 (Newton MRT, most people walked to MRT
              entrance), [-1] 18, [-2+1] 17</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>- Although main loading comes from Pending and Petir, still
              slightly less than half of the pax board from Bukit Panjang Rd</p>
              <p>- Seems that 700's main purpose is for those going to Newton MRT
              now (maybe they transfer from there to CBD?); the remaining pax are
              going to Shenton Way</p>
              <p>- Very little boarding / alighting activities at Orchard, I
              guess because of 190</p>

              <p>If you see my observation for PM, 700 does not get more than 50-55 pax at Whitley while 190/972 go packed houses. Clearly loading has been taken away by 972. With DTL2 coming in, can expect loading to chip off more as those going to Newton will have DTL2. I doubt 972 loading will be affected much as it is very fast for ring road residents to city. They don't need to take feeder to MRT, walk, change etc.</p>

              <p>Can you indicate if bus is SD or DD? </p>
              <p>Overall BSEP has really improved feeders to a huge extent, that now most feeders do not have super high loading as it is spread across multiple buses. Surprised to see your sv 222 loading. Expected a lot more at that hour... Again maybe because of 4 buses added (guess that's lot)... and + you have 222P :)</p>

              <p>Haven't verified morning peak bcoz far from home but PM for sure.. has got massive load of 60-90 pax on each bus. Since the peak period for AM is shorter, can estimate that buses may already come packed from Senja/Segar. </p>
              <p>Most times that's why 972 comes in pairs of two to relieve the load at Fajar HDBs.</p>
              <p>We have to note that Senja has 4 new HDB complexes, Segar has 2 + condos, Fajar has 1 big HDB opened... all in the last 1-2 years... So the loading is going to be quite massive. </p>
              <p>Once DTL2 opens... we can expect 920/922 to be packed as well.. need to see if SMRT/LTA deploys bendies on 920/922 next year. 972 will ofcourse help relieve load on Senja/Segar sectors.</p>

              <p>Here is my analysis: coincidentally it is around the same time period</p>
              <p>18.52 - 225G - 38 pax - SD</p>
              <p><strong>18.54 - 60 - 42 pax - DD</strong></p>
              <p>18.59 - 225G - 64 pax - DD</p>
              <p>19.01 - 225G - 26 pax - DD <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>what the F... why would they send 2 DDs back to back</em></span></p>
              <p><strong>19.02 - 60 - 32 pax - DD</strong></p>
              <p>19.03 - 225G - 17 pax - SD</p>
              <p>19.09 - 225G - 76 pax - SD <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>this is one of the first time I have seen KUB fit in so many. People just cramped in, and even though there was bus right behind, people were pushing. Reckless behavior. this should have been DD slot. </em></span></p>
              <p>19.11 - 225G - 55 pax - SD </p>
              <p>19.18 - 225G - 47 pax - SD</p>
              <p><strong>19.20 - 60 - 76 pax - DD</strong></p>
              <p>19.22 - 225G - 41 pax - DD</p>
              <p>19.23 - 225G - 25 pax - DD <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>again the same pair of DDs came back to back, when just 1 DD could have done the job. Such a waste. And what an illogical deployment. If you have a fleet of 6 buses with 2 DDs in it for a feeder, it just does not make sense to have the DDs back to back.</em></span></p>
              <p>Compared to my previous observation of 225G in April 2015, the loading has reduced or rather spread across more trips/buses. Not a single 225G trip had DD worthy loading contrary to how it was before the BSEP add. For some feeders, the BSEP add is a luxury and excess capacity IMO. </p>

              <p>I personally do feel sv 99 might have a decent loading b/w Joo Koon and Jurong West Town. Also those along st 91/93 may prefer sv 99 to Joo Koon as it might take approximately same amount of time to Joo Koon as to Pioneer MRT (may be a little more to Joo Koon, but then you are guaranteed a seat of choice).</p>
              <p>Will do a tour one month down the line to check loading.</p>

              <p>Before I start with the loading. I walked back from HG Polyclinic to Interchange. I took the rightmost footpath that takes you to interchange via berth of sv 324 and sv 116. </p>
              <p>Few services observed at HCI</p>
              <p>18.24 - 324 - 11 pax</p>
              <p>18.26 - 116 - 23 pax</p>
              <p>18.27 - 102 - saw it pass by, no standees, maybe 20 pax, KUB</p>
              <p>18.33 - 324 - 12 pax</p>
              <p>I left at 18.34 to take 102 which is at other side of interchange. While leaving, 116 queue had 7 pax standing, and next bus was at 18.39 </p>
              <p>18.36 - 161 - 18 pax (DD ofcourse)</p>
              <p>18.37 - 89 - 21 pax (DD)</p>
              <p>18.39 - 102 - 18 pax (DD CDGE)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Loading on 324 wasn't impressive, rather not on any service that I saw leaving HCI though arguably 89, 161 have other loading high points unlike 116, 324 where HCI should give peak loading at that time for the bus.</span></p>
