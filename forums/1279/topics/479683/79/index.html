              busanalyser, objective is totally different. Sbs 324 main purpose
              is to connect those roads with new HDB estates in outskirts of
              Hougang and condos in upper serangoon road to Hougang Mrt. Timing
              of bus service sbs 324 is as late as 12.30am after midnight
              primarily to serve residents. </span></p>

              main objective is to provide another bus service for residents of
              sengkang west to link up to sengkang and buangkok mrt. Another main
              purpose is to extend to seletar aerospace park in future once it is
              getting more developed. The timing is only up to
              11.30pm. </span></p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I think it through but your logic is not too correct. You want sbs 102 extend until 12.30am to cover for sbs 324. But isn't that waste of resources for the extended timing which is contradictory to what you always advocate to save resources? Note sbs 102 needs run full route and back too instead of a much shorter journey. </p>
              <p>We must also think why it was made like this.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">There is also a difference between feeder and trunk service category. In future, feeder must be max 10 min frequency and trunk service will be max 15 min category under LTA rules. This will make a major difference already. Routes such as bringing residents to nearest MRT like sbs 324 is considered feeder to them. So it must be done below 10 min. After it is changed to a so-called sub-con system, sub-con performance will come in. Tender price is fixed. So bus companies will not look at loading. More important is LTA criteria of maintaining fruitful connection for feeder and trunk services. In this case, the logic of sbs 102 (trunk) and sbs 324 (feeder) will come in.  Cheers. Thanks. </span></p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2652G, faster clear quota? No la. The quota is just an imaginary number. Previously, it was 40. Revised to 80 a few years later. They will just watch out the progress and introduced new bus routes for those new towns and those badly connected areas. The BSEP scheme is just to deploy out the buses. Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>Interesting logic.</p>
              <p>So for one hour at midnight when the frequency is low and you anyway don't need much resources/buses, you would rather have another service run full day??? LOL</p>
              <p>Also don't the Sengkang West and Buangkok residents for whom 102 works as a trunk deserve a service until late night??? </p>
              <p>Since you ignored my earlier question, let me answer for you. For short route, fare doesn't make a difference. </p>
              <p>It was LTA's wrong planning and mistake at that point in time. Cannot take it down immediately, but maybe few years down the line will take it out just like they did for 275 feeder, and instead introduce a M service with 1 bus operating during peak loading hour.</p>

              <p>Interesting logic.</p>
              <p>So for one hour at midnight when the frequency is low and you
                      anyway don't need much resources/buses, you would rather have
                      another service run full day??? LOL</p>
              <p>Also don't the Sengkang West and Buangkok residents for whom 102
                      works as a trunk deserve a service until late night??? </p>
              <p>Since you ignored my earlier question, let me answer for you.
                      For short route, fare doesn't make a difference. </p>
              <p>It was LTA's wrong planning and mistake at that point in time.
                      Cannot take it down immediately, but maybe few years down the line
                      will take it out just like they did for 275 feeder, and instead
                      introduce a M service with 1 bus operating during peak loading
                      hour.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, there is no need to get so worked up la. In this forum, it is merely chit chai. Everybody talks in a certain manner. To you it is wrong planning, to them it is not. Just different perspectives at looking at issues. There is no winners or losers in this forum. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Bus 187 loading observations from 12:30pm to 1:25pm at Blk 347 bus stop:</p>
              <p>The average headway is about 06 to 10mins towards BNL where each MAN A22 gets about 40-45 pax on average with some seats empty. According to the LTA app, each 187 bus loading is yellow (indicating standing available, with the exception of 3559X), 187 loading seems decent and MAN A22 is sufficient for the loading at this timing towards BNL.</p>
              <p>The opposite direction 187 have about 40-50pax each from 1pm onwards, due to the loading for after school hours, all the buses heading towards WDL are all A22s, I did not spot any bendies.</p>
              <p>I boarded 3559X at 1:26pm and at the next bus stop (Jurong Polyclinic), quite a number of students boarded the bus. By the time it reaches the end of the Avenue 1 stretch (before turning to Lakeside MRT), the upper deck have about 10-12 people from 25-30 at the Jurong Polyclinic stop.</p>
              <p>What really surprised me is that most of remaining passangers on the upper deck alighted at BNL, as I always thought 157/198 is the preferred choice from Ave 1 to BNL due to better frequencies and having more HC buses as the route length is about the same.</p>
              <p>187's AM off peak loading seems decent for the BNL to Ave 1 stretch with its current frequency though I feel that it might be better if they could convert some of the A22 slots to bendy slots (Conversion is 2 A22 to 1 Bendy, alternate about 2 A22s to 1 bendy or DD)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From Avenue 1, personally, I would prefer to take 198 or 157 to BNL as both services operates a number of DDs which gives me a better chance to get a seat (usually I'll take 198), as compared to 187 which operates on mostly A22.</p>

              I agree merging 102 and 324 would make sense. Upper Serangoon Cres residents like that will have direct connection to North Vista and Palmview schools.
              If last bus end at 0030, last 4 trips can renumber as 102A(end at Seletar Camp)
              Deploy the 324 buses to 102 can already.

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Not getting worked up la. You are spot on that we all are here to share our opinion, feedback and perspective. Hence, you should accept others opinions instead of always saying this cannot be done and that. You are well aware how many people you have gotten into fight over here because you reject others' opinions by stating a very rigid stance. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">You did the same saying M routes always need to start from the starting point of a service. Then services like 53M were introduced. There are no losers/winners here. Let's accept others opinions. My suggestion on 102/324 has been supported by many other users on this forum, so many others agree.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">We should discuss things logically and not because LTA may not agree with our suggestions.</p>

              <p>I feel that 334 can add 1 more AP shift on weekends as the bus is often very crowded both to and from JE Interchange. The double deckers are well utilized on the route though I feel that it could be better if they add 1 more DD to boost frequency on weekends as the buses can get 80-110 pax departing from JE Int during afternoons and nighttime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>241 is also another feeder service where the upper deck is often packed despite being a short route, especially during evening peak where the loading is both from BNL and Pioneer MRT, running at an average 03-05min headway. During AM off peak on weekdays (more specifically, the after school hours), double deckers can have great loading which justifies the utilization of double deckers on 241.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on the loading, my suggestion is to operate SWT 241B with 2 buses on weekdays PM peak for Pioneer MRT to Blk 953 (similar to SWT 241A but operates in evening peak and instead of from St 91 to Pioneer MRT) </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">or do downroutes from Pioneer MRT towards St 91 </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">as 241 bunching at Pioneer MRT in both directions is extremely common where one bus tends to not have much loading while the other one have an almost full upper deck.</span></p>

              <p>I feel that 334 can add 1 more AP shift on weekends as the bus
              is often very crowded both to and from JE Interchange. The double
              deckers are well utilized on the route though I feel that it could
              be better if they add 1 more DD to boost frequency on weekends as
              the buses can get 80-110 pax departing from JE Int during
              afternoons and nighttime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>241 is also another feeder service where the upper deck is often
              packed despite being a short route, especially during evening peak
              where the loading is both from BNL and Pioneer MRT, running at an
              average 03-05min headway. During AM off peak on weekdays (more
              specifically, the after school hours), double deckers can have
              great loading which justifies the utilization of double deckers on
              241.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on the loading, my
              suggestion is to operate SWT 241B with 2 buses on weekdays PM peak
              for Pioneer MRT to Blk 953 (similar to SWT 241A but operates in
              evening peak and instead of from St 91 to Pioneer
              MRT) </span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;">or do
              downroutes from Pioneer MRT towards St 91 </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">as 241 bunching at Pioneer MRT in both
              directions is extremely common where one bus tends to not have much
              loading while the other one have an almost full upper
              deck.</span></p>

              <p>Bro both 334 and 241 have enough buses to take care of the load. 334 is now operating at 05-07 mins peak frequency, all DDs. All SDs converted to DD + 2 DD fleet add. Okay for now. Not all buses get 100 pax. If bus in front is delayed, then yes. Most buses leave JE with 80-90 pax which is comfortable for DD, given many alight along Boon Lay Way too.</p>
              <p>For 241, a lot of crossover buses kick in from 179. Again peak is taken well care of. + have 99 as alternative to st 93 residents from Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>Agree both are one of the highest loading feeders.</p>
