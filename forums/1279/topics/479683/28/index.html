              <p>Tampines is not an issue cause i ever saw <span>SBST</span> ever test a DD from the school(Opp blk 241/240)
              there..<strong>Pasir Ris narrow roads is the cause hence you see why
              358/359 nvr get DDs</strong></p>

              <p>No bro - its not the same reason for 359.</p>
              <p>359 plies larger roads.. there is no problem for DDs.. </p>
              <p>The reason there are no DDs on 359 is that on the west leg you have sv 88/58 covering all the stops.. People have 88/58 at good frequency as well and will take whichever bus comes first.. 359 does not hence have DD worthy loading in west leg.</p>
              <p>For east leg, again people from Dr 1 wil not take it coz it will take more time to reach MRT. People from inner streets mostly opt for 359 - hence again loading is high but only for certain times, and hence 359P is introduced here. </p>
              <p>358 - It has same reasoning as 359 for west loop. Also shares loading w/ 403 on Elias. No DD worthy loading. East loop, it has very few stops that do not amount to DD worthy loading. </p>
              <p>Unlike 291, where it is the only service connecting 90% of its route, 358/359 is opposite. Hence, no DDs. </p>

              <p>Your observation is quite correct but 183 deployment is tricky.</p>
              <p>4 DDs are reserved out of 12 to do 183B for Toh Guan Industrial belt.. if you observe during AM peak between 07.30am and 08.30am at JE Interchange, you will see each bus getting 80-90+ pax at first stop. Many buses during this time even get 110 pax and still pax remain in queue. Hence, apart from 183B, the 183 DDs are also timed such that they leave Jurong MRT between 07.30 and 08.15am.. only then you start seeing SDs on 183. </p>
              <p>This means the first round of DDs you observe are between 06.30 and 07.30am as they have to come back to JE Interchange in time to do the 07.30 to 08.30am slot. Hence, you see SDs coming at Science Park between 07.30 and 08.15am with occassional DDs. </p>
              <p>Now, if you say 183 needs more SD --&gt; DD conversion, I will not see you as someone who asks the same for 113 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> as we are talking about everyday legitimate high loading... bus after bus.</p>

              963 in fact need 12 DDs.Its one of the cash cow service..SMRT jeopardise the operation hours with the introduction of 963R during weekends/PHs.
              In fact 1 E500 from 966 can goes to 966..966 doesnt need too many DDs due to its massive number of buses for a expressway loop service.Svc that really need DDs for now is 169,172,187,189,851,854,857,960.969 also need another 8 DDs.

              <p>Your observation is quite correct but 183 deployment is
              tricky.</p>
              <p>4 DDs are reserved out of 12 to do 183B for Toh Guan Industrial
              belt.. if you observe during AM peak between 07.30am and 08.30am at
              JE Interchange, you will see each bus getting 80-90+ pax at first
              stop. Many buses during this time even get 110 pax and still pax
              remain in queue. Hence, apart from 183B, the 183 DDs are also timed
              such that they leave Jurong MRT between 07.30 and 08.15am.. only
              then you start seeing SDs on 183. </p>
              <p>This means the first round of DDs you observe are between 06.30
              and 07.30am as they have to come back to JE Interchange in time to
              do the 07.30 to 08.30am slot. Hence, you see SDs coming at Science
              Park between 07.30 and 08.15am with occassional DDs. </p>
              <p>Now, if you say 183 needs more SD --&gt; DD conversion, I will
              not see you as someone who asks the same for 113 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> as we are talking about everyday legitimate
              high loading... bus after bus.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>No, the fleet is okay for now, proper number of SDs and DDs deployed. The problem is too many split DDs, which makes bunching rife during peak hours. 183 also suffers from poor frequency in the off-peak hours (9a.m. to PM peak), thanks to the low number of A/P buses. So it is a matter of converting more split DDs to A/P DDs. Because pathetically, only 1 A/P bus is a <strong>DD</strong> (SBS7701R). </p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, sbs 324 loading is very poor during peak hours. About 3 to 5 people. Same as sbs 386 which had school children to push up the loading sometimes. On off peak hours, practically 0-2. Most of the times, the buses are totally empty. Haha.  </p>

              <p>324 max loading I have spotted is 12 pax... but again we have to consider the flats at Upper Serangoon View / Crescent are not operational.. very few units open to public... hence, the loading will uptake only in 2015.</p>
              <p>But very bad routing. This should have rather been a trunk route from Hougang via Upper Serangoon to Buangkok/Anchorvale/Fernvale area. This was a big lost opportunity in route planning. Same mistake like 116.</p>

                      loading/unloading... lot of chances of spot/crash loading if bus is
                      few mins behind schedule.</p>

              <p>* Upper deck was well utilized.. saw many ppl take bus from

                      upper deck</p>

              <p>As a resident along the estates in Boon Lay Ave, I would like to share my experiences of heading to Boon Lay Int from home.</p>
              <p>For my own habit, I usually choose 174/198 rather than 240 because the bus stop for 174/198 is nearer to my flat. (I live at the flats near the intersection of Boon Lay Ave &amp; Boon Lay Pl, near Boon Lay CC rather than Blk 17x/18x)</p>
              <p>The probable reason why people choose 240 is because:</p>
              <p>1) 174 is already packed with the crowd from Bukit Batok alone and usually reaches Blk 213 (the first stop along Boon Lay Ave) packed to the door. By the time the bus reaches the Blk 185 stop, it would be too full to the extent that pax cannot board. It is even worse if the bus that arrived is a single-deck.</p>
              <p>2) 198 also has its heavy demand from Jurong West/Jurong East. Even though it has double-deck buses and has better frequency than 198, it is just as packed as 174 even if a double-deck bus arrives. There was once when I took SBS3138T, the upper deck was full and I had to go downstairs, but the space downstairs was already taken up. Therefore, I end up standing on the stairwell until Boon Lay Int.</p>
              <p>3) 240 is packed as well in the morning in all fairness. As I rarely take 240 to Boon Lay Int in the morning (I take to Lakeside MRT more often as a habit), I cannot comment much on this.</p>
              <p>Probably the pax along Boon Lay Ave are fed up and decides to take 240 instead because of 174/198's crowds. Maybe I can observe again and get back to you.</p>

              <p>Thanks.. And yes pls observe and report back. In my previous PM observations, have seen around 25-30 pax alight at Boon Lay ave and in am/PM, many pax board 240 at Boon Lay ave towards Boon Lay int. </p>
              <p>Also my trip was a little late as I had work in Boon Lay at 9am. So I did a round trip before that. I think most office crowd might have gone, hence loading peaked only at 75 pax that too before lakeside. Earlier trips loafing would be higher IMO. </p>
