              <p>Yes if 4 buses bunch up, definitely the last 2 would have empty loads. Even off peak, Sv 190 frequency is quite high. If there is even 5 minutes caught up in a traffic jam, can get the first bus to get delayed with two buses tailing it. Happens with Sv 27 also all the time because of high frequency. Hence 190 need DDs off peak too with 7-8 minutes frequency in off-peak. It will manage load + reduce bunching issues.</p>

              <p>Yes if 4 buses bunch up, definitely the last 2 would have empty
              loads. Even off peak, Sv 190 frequency is quite high. If there is
              even 5 minutes caught up in a traffic jam, can get the first bus to
              get delayed with two buses tailing it. Happens with Sv 27 also all
              the time because of high frequency. Hence 190 need DDs off peak too
              with 7-8 minutes frequency in off-peak. It will manage load +
              reduce bunching issues.</p>

              <p>Off peak have to reduce the bus coz i dont see the point having bus bunching during these time, if the first bus is very crowded then can understand bus bunching. 190 case even off peak first bus not crowded like to the door but still 2nd,3rd,4th bus can bunch up. </p>
              <p>Its either too much bus deployed on the wrong time or SL just want a longer rest at the terminal thus play around with schedule</p>
              <p>27 off peak also loading is high so i can understand the bus bunching</p>

              <p>I guess this is because the demand for these City Direct services are low, hence to remain profitable/reduce losses, the operator has to increase the fares. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>
              <p>Personally, I have tried out City Direct 651 before.<span style="line-height: 1.231;">That time I purposely went to Marina Bay area just to ride this bus service home. The bus was quite empty - even after it goes onto the expressway - with only a handful of seats taken. Quite clearly, despite the great awareness of this service, the demand for it is quite low. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>Secondly, I noticed something rather disturbing about City Direct 651 when I went to try out the service: the bus driver did not follow the route prescribed by LTA! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">From the AYE, the bus was supposed to exit at Pioneer Road North, then head north to Boon Lay Way and turn to Jurong West Street 61. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Instead, the driver exited at Jalan Boon Lay and the bus was stucked in a traffic jam for a while, before it finally turned to Boon Lay Way (Jurong Point) and headed straight to Jurong West Street 61. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>In short, the demand for City Direct service 651 is low and the service standard is rather bad (because the driver did not follow prescribed route along the express sector).

              taken. Quite clearly, despite the great awareness of this service,
              the demand for it is quite low. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>Secondly, I noticed something rather disturbing about City
              Direct 651 when I went to try out the service: the bus driver did
              not follow the route prescribed by LTA! <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">From the AYE, the bus was supposed to exit at
              Pioneer Road North, then head north to Boon Lay Way and turn to
              Jurong West Street 61. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Instead, the driver exited at Jalan Boon Lay
              and the bus was stucked in a traffic jam for a while, before it
              finally turned to Boon Lay Way (Jurong Point) and headed straight
              to Jurong West Street 61. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="icon_mad.gif"></p>
              <p>In short, the demand for City Direct service 651 is low and the
              service standard is rather bad (because the driver did not follow
              prescribed route along the express sector). This may be the reason
              why only a handful of people want to take City Direct service 651,
              which leads to the operator having to raise the bus
              fare. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="icon_neutral.gif"></p>
              <p>The fare increase will only further reduce the number of people
              taking City Direct service 651, which will eventually lead to the
              withdrawal of this service. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>Possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of City Direct
              service 651 (without having to increase bus fare):</p>
              <ul>
              <li>use a smaller bus - with smaller capacity - to reduce
              costs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> I am sure by now (after 7 full
              months) the operator is able to deduce the average number of people
              using City Direct service 651 and decide if it would be more
              sustainable to use a smaller capacity bus.</li>
              <li>extend the route to serve more areas in the Central Business
              District. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Instead of turning south towards Gardens
              By the Bay, the service could turn north into Chinatown area or
              east into esplanade area. Clearly, this would increase the demand
              for City Direct service 651.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>in the first place, get your facts right. the fare increase is due to the overall increase in transport fare from 6th APRIL... not due to CDG happy happy go increase the price of these Citydirect service.. other city direct should have also increase their fares, but whether they do any press release, we do not know...</p>
              <p>and for evening peak service, the demand is usually lesser as knock time are different and ppl might be going elsewhere for dinner/shopping etc..... u can see from the facts that SBST does not even operate their premium service in evening peak.... even sv531/850E/951E also have less trips in evening peak.... just dun think so much....</p>

              <p>So will opening up existing public bus routes to private bus
              operators in 2016 be good? I doubt so, when they (private bus
              companies) can't even manage a peak hour service

              <p>it wont be so easy. as some other ppl think.... when private operators came in, what they want will be profit instead. right now, it is so difficult to increase fares, and bus operations arent making money, so why should the private operators came in? they would rather go do some shuttle services/charter services and earn much more on per trip basis , rather have to tie in so much resources and adhere to so much rules and regulations..</p>

              <p>Yes both 850E and 951E good candidates for dd. Loading on 982E not picked up as much though. Is it because it does not do Dhoby ghaut? </p>
