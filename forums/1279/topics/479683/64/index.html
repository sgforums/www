              <p>Did you take note of loadings on 38? My hypothesis is that people may prefer 38 as a more direct service from Bedok to Bedok South... But yeah it's possible that they prefer to go to Tanah Merah and transfer to 12/38 (I have seen huge crowds there before).</p>

              <p><br>I believe 228's duplication with 66 is deliberate to supplement 66 which has no DDs (except on weekends) and sometimes has not-so-good frequency. Also 228 provides connection from the looping point to facilities at Bedok North Ave 3, although its loading may not be so great.</p>

              <p>The timing was a bit early IMO... Last time when I went to Hougang, 116 would have at lease &gt;40 pax loading at 8pm and 324 would have &gt;25. Guess the peak loadings would come between 7pm and 7.30pm.</p>
              <p>Also take note that many pax waiting for these services would not join the queue but rather sit at somewhere nearby, until the bus comes.</p>

              <p>I am not disputing that there maybe some buses with &lt;30 pax loading.Just stating real time count on the buses, whether in queue or sitting. IMO 6.20-6.40pm is also quite in the thick of PM peak. And I usually expect between 6-7.30pm buses should have good loading, if not at these timings, then when!?! Just a 30 minute window for PM peak - not sure I agree.</p>

              <p>It only took 15-20 mins between NEX and Hougang. If someone had to transfer, would still need 5 min transfer time + 6 min train ride + walk to 101 bus stop. Overall, I think people might have done their calculation, and seen that it is worth taking bus at NEX instead. Assured seat/boarding especially considering that majority fleet is SD with only 2 DDs.</p>

              <p>Let's continue the discussion on 258 loading here.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jurongresident:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>You sure it is very low? At minimum, it at least has around three passengers from Jurong West Street 81, 75 and 64.</p>
              <p>Actually, after taking bus service 258 for around ten times now, I understand why it is categorised as a Jurong-Industrial Bus Service. As mentioned, it could be that they have data from long ago suggesting that a lot of people take bus from Jurong West (Pioneer and Gek Poh) to the industrial areas, that's why they created this bus service 258 and categorise it as a Jurong-Industrial bus service.</p>
              <p>The primary objectives of bus service 258 are probably to connect the residential area with the industrial area, and to complement bus services 181 and 243G during peak hours. The bus connection to Pioneer MRT Station is probably the secondary objective.</p>
              <p>Well, I feel that bus service 258 has the same kind of loading pattern as a typical JIS. Like the other JISes, loading is (very) high during weekday peak hours and low during other hours. I would not say it is very low, because at least it can fetch around three people during other hours, at you-know-where (street 81, 75 and 64).</p>
              <p>I have been on at least one JIS before. It is 251. That time I went to Shipyard area to take picture. 251 also during other hours have only around three people on the bus. I think sometimes there are even no passenger, during other hours. The only time when it has high loading, it has very high loading, and it is during weekday peak hours. I think likewise for 252, 254, 255 and 257.</p>
              <p>If want to criticise bus service 258, we should criticise the frequency. It is a JIS, yet the frequency during peak hours is not like the other JISes. During peak hours the frequency is around ten minutes. æœ‰æ²¡æœ‰æ�žé”™? :(</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>There is a difference between 258 and other JIS. Hence its frequency is reasonable if it's just for point-to-point connection from Jurong West towards Joo Koon. However, I do agree that an improved frequency would encourage more people to take 258 to Pioneer MRT.</p>
