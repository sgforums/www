              <p>Bro both 334 and 241 have enough buses to take care of the load.
              334 is now operating at 05-07 mins peak frequency, all DDs. All SDs
              converted to DD + 2 DD fleet add. Okay for now. Not all buses get
              100 pax. If bus in front is delayed, then yes. Most buses leave JE
              with 80-90 pax which is comfortable for DD, given many alight along
              Boon Lay Way too.</p>
              <p>For 241, a lot of crossover buses kick in from 179. Again peak
              is taken well care of. + have 99 as alternative to st 93 residents
              from Joo Koon.</p>
              <p>Agree both are one of the highest loading feeders.</p>

              <p>334 frequency on weekends I feel it can operate 1 more AP shift as mentioned on my previous post as the headway is 08-10mins frequency for almost the entire day. For weekdays, 334 is operating at great frequency as you stated and I agree there is no need for a weekday fleet add, in my previous post, I'm referring to a fleet add for weekends.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #00ff00;">The view at Yishun Dam is AWESOME!!!</span></p>

              <p>Punggol Way -- 24 (-5/0), 17 (-7/0)</p>
              <p>Punggol Central -- 17 (0/0)</p>
              <p>* Peak loading = 34 pax was to Yishun MRT, eating into sv 169 loading</p>
              <p>* Yishun Ave 1, Seletar Aerospace still under construction. Hence, loading continues to be poor.</p>
              <p>* Most people are long distance travellers.</p>
              <p>* Upper deck had 80% of pax throughout route, while lower deck had around 5-8 pax through the route</p>
              <p>* Beautiful views enroute 117</p>
              <p>* 805/117 launched too early looks like as flats still far away from completion and occupancy</p>
              <p>* 117 in future will have very high loading given there are monster HDB hubs coming up in Canberra, Yishun Ave 1, Punggol West</p>
              <p>* Frequency of 117 = 13-15 mins. Only 1 bus resting space at PGL Interchange. Next 117 bus comes and stands behind parking lot of 117 forcing it to get out. </p>
              <p>* Observed packed 103 buses in opposite direction towards Yishun (#2 of them).</p>

              <p><strong>From 6.30pm to 7.30pm observations at Punggol Interchange.</strong></p>
              <p>* Not one bus goes packed from Punggol Interchange unlike other interchanges</p>
              <p>* Every bus on 382G/W gets less than 10 pax (understandable because only 1-2 buildings in the west estate where 382G/W exclusively plies have flats opened for occupancy). The loading on 382W was 08, 05, 08, 04 pax while on 382G was 07, 00, 02 and 03 pax during the time I observed.</p>
              <p>* Among 3/83/85 people take whichever come first. People also run for 136/386 from 3/83 queue when they see those buses arrive (these are for first two stops of Punggol Central I guess)</p>
              <p>* On average 3 always follows 83. 83 takes around 40-50 pax, 3 takes 10-20 pax. </p>
              <p>* Counted 4 buses on 386 with the following loading (39, 38, 41, 37). Pretty consistent for each bus, lower than my last observation last week of 45 pax from int. In fact, 83 &amp; 386 are the only 2 services that have a queue formed at interchange. 83 because it arrives 2 mins before sv 3. If sv 3 arrived before 83, you know the queue for sv 3 would be long.</p>
              <p>* Observed 2 buses on 119 leaving interchange with 3 and 2 pax. I was shocked to see this because I though 119 would get good number of pax to Punggol Field given the huge number of HDBs / condos there + 382G also got &lt;5 pax on every bus.</p>
              <p>* Observed 2 DDs on 117 leaving interchange with 17 &amp; 21 pax.</p>

              <p>- Expected more students at this time... But maybe DTL has taken away its loading (same as the case for many other services)<br>- Bukit Timah students do take 852 all the way to YCK/Yishun</p>

              <p>- Loading does seem to have dropped, as previously DDs at 10.10pm on Sundays would be packed to the door<br>- However, could also be that it's not peak hours for weekend nights yet (most of the pax on this bus are still Singaporeans)<br>- Also did not observe many foreign workers on DTL towards BPJ during this time period, so I don't think it's the case of pax switching to DTL<br>- Note that people don't really use bus services along Bukit Timah corridor to connect to DTL stations from their houses. Most of the times buses just skip the bus stops at MRT stations. (However those living in condos/private housing do take DTL)</p>

              <p>Is this done on weekends? Usually during peak hours you would see good loading on 26, 31, 985...</p>
              <p>Again, it's time to extend 141 to Eunos to ease the load on 21. Way much better than using a half-empty Eunos interchange to house 76 and 150.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Lot of people boarded at Ferrar MRT for Balestier (noticed that 130 is the only service that covers entire stretch, alternative is 21 that does a long loop)</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* More DDs may be required on 130 given the loading and also unique nature of its route, considering it is only service going from Bugis to Kitchener and from Ferrar to Balestier. Also only service from Balestier to Thomson and in Sing Ming Industrial area</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* I think by the time 130 came to Sing Ming Industrial area, the peak loading time had passed; I believe loading will be higher between 530-645pm in this area</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* 130 buses in opposite direction did not have much loading (high loading mostly seems uni-directional).</p>

              <p>145 should def get more DDs.</p>
              <p>The thing with 145 is that when only SDs were allowed, there was massive fleet add to manage the crowd. Especially for Lavendar-Balestier, it is the only service and likewise for Balestier - TPY (139 is only a part). </p>
              <p>So I hope as loading increases on 145, they do not add SDs, but instead do SD-&gt;DD conversion. Also note, 145 has bi-directional loading so will be great to have more DDs.</p>
              <p>Also see my loading assessment on 130. I think 130 should get few more DDs as well.</p>

              <p>Freq of Punggol LRT serving the west loop is bad because there are only 1 - 2 trains running.. Off peak only one train running. This is also due to the nature of plying one direction and skipping three stations which are punggol point, sam kee etc.</p>
