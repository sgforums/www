              <p>Weekends mah,thus you see 84 almost full..Their peak loadings is
              from Friday evening,Saturdays,Sundays and PHs..Can get an average
              of 35-45 pax per bus..Normal days just 20-25 odd pax the most.</p>

              <p>No wonder sbs transit increases the frequency for sbs 84 from 24 min a bus to 10 min a bus by adding 1 more bus to sbs 84 fleet. Currently sbs 84 fleet has 2 buses. Today 5.25pm, the loading for sbs 84 is 45 people boarding at bus interchange. At sheng siong bus stop, another 7 people boarded. The bus is so packed and this is the first time I saw more people on sbs 84 than the usually crowded sbs 83. All the people on board sbs 84 are heading towards Punggol settlement (a huge cluster of restaurants at Punggol end). Super crowded at weekends ever since Punggol settlement opened. Cheers.</p>

              <p>* Lot of boarding/alighting and many short distance pax. Very few long distance pax.</p>
              <p>* Main <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000;">loading comes to complement sv 131</span></span> between Thomson and Rangoon. Ever remember days when sv 131 would be packed-to-door in this sector. If not 141, I am sure 131M would have been introduced (I know that 131M now exists as substitute for 275) </p>
              <p>* Provides <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #008000;">unique</span></span> connection to Lor 1 Toa Payoh. Especially saw many alighting at Philips. Lazy people boarding bus even at Orleander Towers to Toa Payoh (one stop before termination)</p>
              <p>* This service could easily have been merged with sv 140 to terminate at Lor 1 Geylang (just that on leg to Toa Payoh, it would have to do one loop around Boon Keng) </p>
              <p>* Observed this service since many feel it is a poorly planned service. But I feel it is still more unique and better than other services like 116 and 120.</p>

              <p>Problem with 72 is it is very heavily utilised in every sector.. 72 is a very well planned bus route and a major cash cow for sbs transit. YCK sector is the worst. Esp when ITE/NYP sch dismissal you would never get on a bus 72 if u dont queue up at the interchange. Good thing it has very good frequency however it's runtime needs to be tighter.</p>

              I spent some time observing sv 35 at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal from 16:35 to 17:56 today. From what I can see, there are usually 15-20 pax at TMFT taking sv 35 towards Bedok per bus in average. However, the frequency of sv 35 is inconsistent (probably due to traffic jams along Tanah Merah Coast Rd), hence some buses have 30 pax boarding and some have 3. Noticed that many of these commuters walk to TMFT from somewhere else (probably Tanah Merah Coast Rd). Buses towards Alps Ave have about 10 pax alighting at TMFT. As for Alps Ave side, not many pax towards Bedok: generally 5-10 pax onboard when the buses were reaching TMFT. (However, don't forget the time of my observation: I believe many ppl are still working). There are confusions about the red/white plates of sv 35: many tried to board 35 towards Alps Ave (especially travellers just arrived at TMFT), but those who seem to take 35 fr.uently already know which one to board. 
              After this, I boarded SBS6503C towards Bedok Int. Bus left TMFT fully seated and reached Xilin Ave at 6pm. Loadings along Xilin Ave: +19, +19, +6 (5 pax left behind because the Citaro was full). All except 15-20 pax alighted at Tanah Merah MRT while 10+ pax boarded the bus here towards Bedok.

              <p>Good observation and thanks for posting. Interesting to see that the service has still not gained popularity with those working at Alps avenue. By 5.30pm, many ppl leave work at Alps. Maybe because shuttle is still on and people have paid for it? Once shuttle gets discontinued, people will have to move to sv 35. </p>
              <p>My earlier observation was same. Lot of pax board at Xilin ave coz of industrial estate. Maybe once Alps pax increase, people along Xilin will find even more difficulty to board. Time to extend sv 20 to UEC via Tanah Merah MRT? </p>
              <p>This way people at CBP also will get two options: Tanah Merah and Simei, easing the loading on sv 20 itself.</p>

              <p>Every morning i see 85 half filled or with few standees during AM and PM peak. I have never seen 85 full before.. Maybe is because 39 is duplicating 85 from Yishun to Jln Kayu sector and 85 dosent stop at jalan kayu? Correct me if im wrong because most of the time i take/see 85, it has only 40pax most of the time</p>

              <p>That is my observation as well. It's not a well planned route. For Sengkang residents, 965 to Yishun is faster. For Punggol residents, x-over at TPE bus stop on sv 39 is faster. sv 85 must have really lost pax after opening of TPE bus stop b'coz I was observing even buses passing by in opposite direction were half seated to empty. </p>
              <p>965 on the other hand has had quite a surge in loading and is doing quite well. </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, 4th statement is not valid. For Punggol residents, those staying near MRT will take sbs 82 to Punggol road (3 stops away) and cross overhead pass to take smrt 965 to yishun. For those residents living at end of Punggol central near Punggol east, it is comparable to take sbs 85 direct from Punggol central. Time taken will be just few minutes more than taking sbs 83 to Punggol road to transfer to smrt 965. It will be wiser to take sbs 85 because you are guaranteed of a seat and there is no need to cross bridge to take smrt 965 at Punggol road. </p>
              <p>Nobody in his right sense of mind at Punggol will want to transfer bus to the TPE stop then walk across the super long winded bridge to the other side and wait for sbs 39 to go yishun if he has sbs 85 at his doorstep. For those who just stayed next to the TPE stop, they will walk over to take sbs 39 (because they no need transfer a bus and they do not have sbs 85). </p>
              <p>So I say the stop at TPE did not affect sbs 85 loading as it has always been this poor. The frequency is also this bad thus I have made it clear that sbs 85 cannot be fully trusted for loading for Punggol central. Sbs 85 loading is consistently poor throughout the whole week for years and Punggol residents have already acknowledged that it is much worse than sbs 3 and 83. That is also why I have voiced out earlier and insisted sbs 83 direction cannot be reversed to start at sengkang and loop at Punggol. Or else Punggol central residents will have to rely on sbs 3 only (plus half of sbs 83 and half of sbs 85 since they are hit with external factors). Cheers.</p>

              <p>Okay. Point granted. Then it means there aren't enough people who travel between Punggol and Yishun bcoz as per my observation, during peak hour there was almost no one who took it from Punggol to Yishun and the little bit loading that came was between Sengkang west and east town.</p>
              <p>No wonder frequency will continue to be poor as the route is poorly planned and there is very little demand. Also, sv 85 did take a lot of time within Sengkang till it finally reached TPE. If it was me, I would be better off to take sv 83 and crossover to take sv 965. </p>

              <p>Things may be better but it can be possible, to extend from
              Yishun to Sembawang. No matter what I think can but judging at the
              state, it will affect the loading, and more commuters will be
              worried. That is to say, extend 103.</p>

              <p>Dont think 103 can be touched. It's current route would be very popular once Seletar Airport completes renovation and when the public has access to the airport in the near future.</p>

              <p>I think he means extend via Seletar, Yishun Ave 1 to terminate at Yishun or Sembawang. That route makes lot of sense, as would give Ring road, interior Yishun residents direct connection, as well as connect Seletar airport to Yishun. </p>
              <p>But with 103 extension to Yishun (if it happens, and I recommend it does), they need to do something to sv 85 to make it more worth its while. </p>

              <p>* I expected the loading to be higher, given that Upper Serangoon flats are now complete</p>

              <p>* sv 324 frequency seems very good, because when bus was at HG Ave 7/8 junction, another 324 passed in opposite direction (totally empty as expected as it was towards Upper Serangoon Crescent)</p>
              <p>* Anyone observed bus with good loading on sv 324?</p>
