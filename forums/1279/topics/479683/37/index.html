              <p>I went to Bedok interchange to specially check on 225G loading and click pictures. This is maybe the 6th time I observe that buses on 225G (DDs) leave the interchange with almost full upper deck.</p>
              <p>Please see above 2 pictures as pictures don't lie. I think this should put an end to people saying DDs on 225 are useless. I have said this before and say it now. Please go and observe yourself how well the DDs are getting used during peak hours, and how one DD clears the queue while SDs have pax left over. </p>
              <p>Observed 4 DDs at 18.25 (3721J) = <strong>96 pax</strong>, 18.40 (3682M) = <strong>101 pax</strong>, 18.55 (3721J) = <strong>86 pax</strong>, 19.06 (3682M) = <strong>105 pax.</strong></p>
              <p>As you can see the 4 trips I observed in peak hour time between 18.20 and 19.10, on an <strong>average got 95 pax on bus. </strong></p>
              <p>I think its high time we stop complaining about upper decks not being used. If it can do so well on the shortest feeder in Singapore, I am sure it will do well on others as well. No wonder 225W got a BSEP DD add. I could not observe 225W but only can say queues were pretty long for 225W as well. </p>
              <p>On the contrary two sv 18 buses I saw while entering and leaving interchange, both left Bedok interchange with 02 and 08 pax respectively. What a waste of resource!</p>

              <p>I typed a long essay just now but it was lost due to a technical error... Anyway, my points are:</p>
              <p>1. Sv 18's loading was not bad before Bedok Int opened because of the bus stop at Bedok town centre. Also many people take 18 from Ave 2 towards Tampines during PM.</p>
              <p>2. IMO there have to be some services which may not have good loadings but provide unique links/connections.</p>
              <p>3. IMO, not all feeders or services functioning like feeders are suitable for DDs: it all depends on the habits of the commuters.</p>

              <p>I know that... my point was to illustrate full upper deck and carrying 90+ pax... as many of you including you said 225 should not have DDs... This is just to say if you see loading.. and how it clears the loads... it definitely justifies DDs.. If only SDs you will see very long queues... and people will complain.</p>
