              <p>Is good lah I guess the service is like that. Maybe you can do a loading for Svc 169. The loading is damn good for the service during PM peak hours.</p>
              <p>I alighted from this bus at Northpoint. The load from Woodlands Int also promising one. I guess people prefer to take this bus rather than 858/964 to Ave 9.. IMO, need to do something for these services also.</p>

              <p>Since lot of dicussion on <strong>sv 171</strong>, here is the loading at 07.50am from Yishun Interchange</p>
              <p>Yishun Interchange -- 44</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 5 -- 50 (0/6), 55 (-5/10)</p>
              <p>Sembawang Rd -- 54 (-9/8)</p>
              <p><em>I got a call.. so could not do the loading calculation from here on but here are observations.</em></p>
              <p>** Bus had around 55-60 pax all through to BPJ</p>
              <p>** Lot of people boarded 171 along Pending/Petir road... the bus seemed packed to door before hitting Upper Bukit Timah road (don't know exact count but I am sure it had 65+ pax for sure)</p>
              <p>** Never thought 171 was one of those services with such high loading. If you see from Sembawang road to BPJ, it takes quite some time and people go standing all the way</p>
              <p>** So add 171 as another poorly managed service that was deprived high capacity buses even though its route justifies it. Imagine the number of people who would not take it because they don't know if they will get a place in the bus and have to go standing so long (we are not talking of a service where people board/alight every stop creating space for people to find seats along the route). This is a service like 161/168 where if no DD, people have to stand for long time.</p>

              <p>165's demands are more at the start of both of its terminating points, which 132 doesnt cover, and frequency of 116 does not cover as well. At clementi, it's berth placement meant that only 165 was available to them if there are travelling to the first few stops after Clementi. </p>
              <p>other than that, with the frequency it has, SDs are more than sufficient as there are so many other alternatives like:</p>

              <p>156 loading for Bukit Timah - Clementi stratch is even more
              dramatic... Just yesterday, I was one of the only 3 passengers
              onboard 156 from Bukit Timah to Holland Rd. And its frequency is

              <p>Clementi to Sixth Ave still got few pax (only route but again mostly people with cars live in Sixth Ave, so bus is never that full)... the loading has quite dropped between Boundary road and Sengkang... I attribute it to 109 and 43/43M both having better frequency / high capacity buses.</p>

              <p>You do have a point on 171 providing link between Bt Timah Rd &amp; Orchard, it does seem to be more direct than 174.

              <p><br>No I'm not joking. It's (almost) confirmed that there will be no paid link between DTL Newton and NSL Newton. </p>
              <p>1. If you go to LTA website and check the MRT map, you'll see that the station codes for Newton (NS21 and DT11) have some space inbetween and are connected by two black lines, unlike other interchange stations. The only 2 other stations like this are Bukit Panjang and Tampines, the latter almost confirmed to have no paid link. For Bukit Panjang, the current link seems to be an unpaid link also.</p>
              <p>2. Check out these posts in SkyscraperCity forum.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, if there's really no paid link at Newton, I would still prefer 171 from Bukit Timah to Orchard, instead of taking bus, crossing an overhead bridge, taking DTL (which may be flooded with crowds from Bukit Panjang), exiting the faregates at DTL Newton, entering NSL Newton, and taking NSL for 1 stop to Orchard.</p>

              <p>Hmmm.. Timing wise a bit off. Should start around 7pm. Whereas, loading wise, you should start from Blk 624 Bus Stop. Loading is much more. I think even some took 850E if 860 isn't arriving.</p>

              <p>Not sure bro if timing is off... because it was consistently same range from 6.00pm to 6.30pm which is PM peak... if you observed 804/806 etc their queues are long from 5.45pm itself.</p>
              <p>And you see the frequency. Bus every 03 mins... It could be that Blk 624 onwards loading is more but the particular bus I took had the following loading.</p>
              <p>21, 21, 21 (no pax boarded), Ring road -- 39 (0/18), 44 (-2/7)... I alighted here and walked back to Khatib MRT.</p>

              <p>201's loading is very good between Clementi and Kent Ridge (but could be due to poor frequency). That's not the case for the Clementi - Pandan Gdns stratch.

              <p>I'm not sure if the situation is better during AM peak (hopefully there will be people taking 201 to Clementi). But it's really annoying for me to keep seeing full DDs on 201 become empty at Clementi MRT.</p>
              <p>Maybe it would be even better to retain the old 189 route, and introduce a new service from Clementi Int to Clementi Ave 1, Clementi MRT, Pandan Gdns and back to Clementi Int, following 307 style.</p>

              <p>The thought of having Teban/Pandan and Penjuru road connecting to Clementi is good, but Teban/Pandan have been pampered with many services, the last being 143M before 201 was introduced. So I guess except those who work at Clementi itself, there is no incentive to alight from MRT at Clementi and take 201. Rather do the 4 min journey to Jurong East and take 51/79/143/143M.</p>

              <p>Since lot of dicussion on <strong>sv 171</strong>, here is the
                  loading at 07.50am from Yishun Interchange</p>
              <p>Yishun Interchange -- 44</p>
              <p>Yishun Ave 5 -- 50 (0/6), 55 (-5/10)</p>
              <p>Sembawang Rd -- 54 (-9/8)</p>
              <p><em>I got a call.. so could not do the loading calculation from
                  here on but here are observations.</em></p>
              <p>** Bus had around 55-60 pax all through to BPJ</p>
              <p>** Lot of people boarded 171 along Pending/Petir road... the bus
                  seemed packed to door before hitting Upper Bukit Timah road (don't
                  know exact count but I am sure it had 65+ pax for sure)</p>
              <p>** Never thought 171 was one of those services with such high
                  loading. If you see from Sembawang road to BPJ, it takes quite some
                  time and people go standing all the way</p>
              <p>** So add 171 as another poorly managed service that was
                  deprived high capacity buses even though its route justifies it.
                  Imagine the number of people who would not take it because they
                  don't know if they will get a place in the bus and have to go
                  standing so long (we are not talking of a service where people
                  board/alight every stop creating space for people to find seats
                  along the route). This is a service like 161/168 where if no DD,
                  people have to stand for long time.</p>

              <p>So we see the Yishun - Bt Panjang, Yishun - Bt Timah and Bt Panjang - Bt Timah demands all crowding into 171 because there are no better alternatives?</p>
              <p>One possible solution would be to divert 700 via Eng Neo Ave / Dunearn Rd to alleviate the load, seeing there's alternatives 190/972 to Whitley / Orchard.</p>
              <p>But things would definitely change after DTL2 opens. By then it may be suitable to cut the service after Botanic Gardens. It has many buses to back the remainder of its route up along Dunearn Rd.</p>
              <p>In short, wait after DTL2 opens, then we could do some re-evaluation.</p>

              <p>I was using the updated SBS Transit iris app (with info of availability of seats/standing), at around 6.40pm, and was quite surprised to see a lot of buses on 116 and some on 120 indicated as "standing available". Even 324 has no seats when reaching Upp Serangoon View.</p>
              <p>Many other services just show seating available for the most of their journey, so I wonder how did 116 and 120 show so much improvement...</p>

              <p>Any SD service with 30 pax on board will show "standing available" that does not mean the service has high loading... </p>
