              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by array88:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I wonder, are Ngee Ann and SIM students (together with other pax
              at Clementi Rd) really satisfied with buses to Clementi MRT? Or is
              the demand to Dover MRT actually higher?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, at 5.30pm or so, I was on 154 at Clementi Rd towards
              Clementi MRT. There was a 184 bendy in front so the 154 DD that I
              was taking did not receive that much loading at Ngee Ann / SIM
              (although it did get full upper deck in the end). What's the most
              surprising is that, a 74 DD was following my 154, and at almost
              every stop, it received a HUGE amount of pax.</p>
              <p>Like at Ngee Ann and SIM, 5-10 pax each took 154 while 50-60 pax
              took 74... There were people who deliberately waited for 74, and
              there were also people who was originally ready to board 154, but
              switch to 74 after seeing it. And this is when a 184 bendy had
              already called at the stops &lt;1min ago.</p>
              <p>In the end (at somewhere after Holland Rd), the 74 DD skipped
              one bus stop and overtook 154, even when there were 10+ pax waiting
              at the bus stop. Guess it's because the 74 was already packed to
              the door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question is, is the demand over there more towards
              Clementi MRT or Dover MRT? Maybe many people actually want to go
              to/from Dover MRT, but are forced to use Clementi MRT (especially
              in AM) because of <span style="color: #ff0000;">poor frequency on 74</span>, versus 3 services with good
              frequency and capacity from Clementi.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>74 by no means has poor frequency, but yes when you have a 52, 154, 184... people are okay to travel one more stop and alight at Clementi instead... makes a difference of 03 minutes only. </p>
              <p>In PM definitely if sv 74 comes and has space, people will prefer 74 to Dover than Clementi given that the traffic towards Clementi in PM can be quite high. But also note 74 buses come almost empty to Ngee Ann... so it is almost like a SWT starting from Ngee Ann/SIM. </p>

              <p>18.49 - 51p (DD)</p>
              <p>* The frequency on 243W is way too awesome. There was a bus consistently every 02-04 mins. Maximum waiting time for the peak hour that I observed was 04 mins only.</p>
              <p>Number of buses in loading range: </p>
              <p>+70 = 01</p>
              <p>60 - 70 = 01</p>
              <p>50 - 60 = 04</p>
              <p>30 - 50 = 03</p>
              <p>&lt; 30 = 02</p>
              <p>Total buses observed = 11</p>
              <p>** This kind of shows that now with so many buses added, if 243W is full fleet SD... it will still be able to cater to the load. To add to it, 258 will also be introduced.</p>

              <p>** Extremely shocking. All buses got &lt;20 pax. I always thought 257 had better loading to st 61/62. Also it looks like 243W loading also is more after st 62. If it was at st 62, then people could have taken 257 also or maybe were stuck in 243W queue. No idea but loading seems really bad on 257 between Boon Lay and Pioneer.</p>

              <p>I wonder, are Ngee Ann and SIM students (together with other pax
              at Clementi Rd) really satisfied with buses to Clementi MRT? Or is
              the demand to Dover MRT actually higher?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, at 5.30pm or so, I was on 154 at Clementi Rd towards
              Clementi MRT. There was a 184 bendy in front so the 154 DD that I
              was taking did not receive that much loading at Ngee Ann / SIM
              (although it did get full upper deck in the end). What's the most
              surprising is that, a 74 DD was following my 154, and at almost
              every stop, it received a HUGE amount of pax.</p>
              <p>Like at Ngee Ann and SIM, 5-10 pax each took 154 while 50-60 pax
              took 74... There were people who deliberately waited for 74, and
              there were also people who was originally ready to board 154, but
              switch to 74 after seeing it. And this is when a 184 bendy had
              already called at the stops &lt;1min ago.</p>
              <p>In the end (at somewhere after Holland Rd), the 74 DD skipped
              one bus stop and overtook 154, even when there were 10+ pax waiting
              at the bus stop. Guess it's because the 74 was already packed to
              the door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question is, is the demand over there more towards
              Clementi MRT or Dover MRT? Maybe many people actually want to go
              to/from Dover MRT, but are forced to use Clementi MRT (especially
              in AM) because of poor frequency on 74, versus 3 services with good
              frequency and capacity from Clementi.</p>

              <p>I seldom see NP/SIM Students alighting at Dover to squeeze with SP students. Maybe they are travelling towards Buona Vista(not MRT but those stops inbetween).</p>
              <p>Secondly..<br>Base on what I've seen..NP/SIM students would take 184 to and from Clementi MRT. </p>

              <p>If 961 main loading is between Chinatown and Bukit Merah, then it does not warrant DDs... as you have 147 with a very good frequency to cover this stretch. On the return leg you also have 197 as well. </p>

              <p><br>Well.... There was once I took 74 from Dover to Bukit Timah during PM peak. An SD came and more than 100 pax were trying to board... Obviously people couldn't board and I had to wait for the next DD which also got full upper decker. The bus became empty at SIM.</p>
              <p>There are also a few cases where I wait for buses at Clementi Rd towards Bukit Timah, and from my experience, 74 is always harder to board than 154.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p><br> Well.... There was once I took 74 from Dover to Bukit Timah during
                  PM peak. An SD came and more than 100 pax were trying to board...
                  Obviously people couldn't board and I had to wait for the next DD
                  which also got full upper decker. The bus became empty at SIM.</p>
              <p>There are also a few cases where I wait for buses at Clementi Rd
                  towards Bukit Timah, and from my experience, 74 is always harder to
                  board than 154.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yup, several occasion a Strider/DM3500 (at that time) came and not many are able to board. That is why the DDs/another SD are either the downroute from SIM/NP bus stop after the first bus left or bunching happens. That's how Svc 74 is unique for the students along this sector.</p>
              <p>As for 154, if there is no buses (74/151) at the bus stop, students who are heading to Bukit Timah Rd just board the 154 and alight at Bef Rifle Range Rd bus stop. This is where the load gets heavy.</p>
              <p>Thus, you can conclude that Svc 74 is a cash-cow service for SBS Transit though by MRT is faster but Svc 74 imo is a legend.</p>

              <p>oh. i wud have thought 6-7pm would be high load also. if that case then bus should start evening shift one hr late and continue for 7-8pm peak time. so then bus can reduce already. even 291, 293 case same. now bus leave int with 40-55 peop even dd. so many bus. and bet 4-5pm bus depart with 20-25 peop. bet 5-6pm bet 30-50 peop. 6-7pm is 40-55 peop. 7-8pm is also 40-50 peop.</p>

              <p>Agree. Last time when I took 181 at 8pm it was still packed to the door (SD) with 20-30 pax in queue... I think peak for feeder services starts later than trunk services as people will need to travel from CBD etc to the respective bus interchanges/MRT first.</p>

              <p>By the way 181 loading between 6-7pm also has every bus getting 80-100 pax... Since it is not qualified as a feeder.. LTA hasn't randomly added buses... This is in the same time period when I observed 243W... and you see the loading. </p>
              <p>Remember that PM peak for feeders is longer... Starts at 5.45pm and extends upto 8pm... depending on where people's work place is... </p>

              <p><strong>972 deserves the 27 DDs and 190 needs more DDs.</strong></p>
              <p>Here is the observation from Thu 05/Nov from Whitley road bus stop. The way I analyzed is using the app after the bus has left Whitley road bus stop. </p>
              <p>18.44 - 190 - DD (yellow)</p>

              <p>19.11 - 972 - DD (red)</p>
              <p>19.11 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.12 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>

              <p>19.17 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.19 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.23 - 700 - SD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.25 - 972 - DD (yellow)</p>
              <p>19.25 - 190 - SD (red)</p>
              <p>19.29 - 190 - DD (red)</p>
              <p>* In a span of 45 mins, following is the observation:</p>
              <p>(190) - (12 buses) - (frequency 03-04 mins) - (7 DDs, 1 BD, 4 SDs) - (6R, 6Y, 0G)</p>
              <p>(700) - (04 buses) - (frequency 10 mins) - (4 SDs) - (0R, 4Y, 0G)</p>
              <p>(972) - (08 buses) - (frequency 05-06 mins) - (8 DDs) - (1R, 6Y, 1G)</p>
              <p>* If you see apart from 1 bus on 972 no other bus had green after departing Whitley road bus stop. Also note the fantastic frequency. There is a service every 01-02 mins to BPJ town from Whitley, and the observations does not include 960. </p>
              <p>* No wonder LTA added another 3 DDs to 972 </p>
              <p>* Now SMRT needs to convert SD-&gt;DD because clearly every SD is packed to door. </p>
              <p>* What also amuses me is that people know there will be a bus behind, mostly a DD and still are ready to cramp into a SD</p>
              <p>* When 2 buses arrive, people distribute evenly among 2 buses to board. In one instance for 972 the latter bus got so full because a lot of people alighted from 153/154 and ran to 972 to board. So bus in back did not have any more space. </p>
              <p>* Also note, my observation may be at the most prime time; at other times buses may not have such high loading.</p>
              <p>* sv 700 had lot of space on every bus. I think loading would be around 45-55 pax. Clearly, 972 has taken away 700's loading.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>In my opinion, this is how I think the loading would be like on bus service 258:</p>
                          <p>For the section between Pioneer MRT Station and Joo Koon Bus Interchange, it is likely that throughout the day, the loading is very low - usually zero, sometimes a handful.</p>
                          <p>For the section between Pioneer MRT Station and Jurong West Street 82, there should be around forty people taking it during peak hours. During non-peak hours, this number may be as low as... less than five. The connection of 258 to Pioneer MRT Station may encourage some of the people to change to take 258.</p>
                          <ul>
                          <li> Assuming only street 81 and 71 people use this connection, there should be around 5 people from Street 71 and 81 making the switch from 243 (if frequency is around six minutes) to 258.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                          <li>The connection of 258 to Pioneer MRT Station would encourage many people at street 81 and 71 who take 179 or 241 to change to take 258, thanks to the unreliability of 179 and the difficulty to board 241 at Pioneer Road North. Looking at how the people who take 179 at street 81 to get to Pioneer MRT Station can actually fill up a double decker bus, there should be at least half a single decker bus size of people making the change to take 258; around 30 people from Street 81. </li>
                          </ul>
                          <div>For the section between Jurong West Street 82 and Boon Lay Bus Interchange, there will always be at least around five to ten people taking it.</div>
                          <ul>
                          <li> As the people there will take whichever bus (181, 243W, 258) that comes first, a double-decker bus on 258 should be around 50% occupied during peak hours, when it goes to Boon Lay Bus Interchange. </li>
                          </ul>
                          <ul>
                          <li>When 258 returns to Joo Koon, the loading between Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Jurong West Street 82 may be up to half a single decker (thirty) during regular hours, and around single decker (seventy) during peak hours. 258 may take away around half of 243G loading. </li>
                          </ul>
                          <div>Overall, bus service 258 should be able to make enough revenue to recover the costs.</div>
