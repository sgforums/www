              <p>I'm quite surprised to see loading on 20 pick up so quickly at Tampines Ave 5 during AM... Which means they're likely transfer pax from 34 etc. And it's crazy to have 58 pax even before it hits Simei MRT... Last time when I did loading analysis on 20, only 30-40 pax left after Simei MRT towards Tampines.</p>
              <p>Svc 20 should definitely be getting more DDs.... Quite ironic that many DD services (including some services with almost full fleet DD) do not have DD loading (especially during off-peak), but some services with really high loading end up getting less DDs. Especially new services and those services that only become DD-friendly recently, like 66, 145 etc.</p>

              <p>At 10.10pm, I took a 66 DD at Botanic Gardens MRT towards Jurong East. Upper deck was full of Indian workers. Lower deck not really packed to the door, but still quite crowded with standees. (I had to alight opposite NJC so couldn't see where the crowds were heading to)</p>
              <p>Wonder how 66 coped with such loading before it got DDs.</p>
              <p>A 67 DD just called at Botanic Gardens MRT 3 minutes before this 66 DD, so 66's role is not just to compliment 67. Which means that 66 may still have high loadings even after DTL opens.</p>

              <p>seems like the bus was late as ptbm spotted another sv 20 bus in 2 minutes after alighting, but I do agree sv 20 should get more DDs instead of fleet add. But then again, waiting for CBP terminal to open as I believe once CBP opens, there might be direct bus link to Tanah Merah, that might take off load from sv 20. For now, more DDs pls!</p>

              <p>I cannot upload the photos here... So just describe in words
              first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 10.10pm, I took a 66 DD at Botanic Gardens MRT towards Jurong
              East. Upper deck was full of Indian workers. Lower deck not really
              packed to the door, but still quite crowded with standees. (I had
              to alight opposite NJC so couldn't see where the crowds were
              heading to)</p>
              <p>Wonder how 66 coped with such loading before it got DDs.</p>
              <p>A 67 DD just called at Botanic Gardens MRT 3 minutes before this
              66 DD, so 66's role is not just to compliment 67. Which means that
              66 may still have high loadings even after DTL opens.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Svc 66 afaik, most Indian Workers prefer to take bus to Jurong East then transfer to MRT. Even like in Yishun, 857 is the most popular service for the Indian workers as compared to Svc 851. This is just my opinion coz I always see them taking 857 more towards Serangoon Rd.</p>

              <p>143M is one of the "wasted resources" service. I have mentioned this many times previously and for good reason.</p>
              <p>Teban Gardens is way too spoilt with too many services now and the one that comes first gets the loading, and there will always be another bus following that will go all the way empty to interchange.</p>
              <p>Teban Gardens: 143, 143M, 79 + 201 (might have a different catchment though during AM, some might take it to Clementi than JE)</p>
              <p>Pandan Gardens: 51, 143, 143M, 201</p>
              <p>Most of the above are 90% times a DD... In fact it is interesting to see that when 143M trails a 143 from Pandan to JE, it won't have more than 10-15 pax throughout as the 143 in front takes all the load. The 10-15 pax would be the ones who missed the bus by a whisker.</p>
              <p>Likewise 79 comes empty from Buroh during AM, and now goes all the way empty to interchange. Earlier 79 would get critical mass at Teban Gardens, so had good bi-directional loading in Teban/Jurong east area.</p>

              <p>No buddy... not at all... I wouldn't say 201 is a waste</p>
              <p>- loading is decent, in fact great between Clementi and Kent Ridge, and not poor between Clementi and Teban</p>
              <p>- provides new connections and alternative to 154 for AYE/Clementi as well as for Teban/Pandan to transfer to other services along AYE</p>
              <p>- those going to Clementi don't need to go back to JE and take MRT. Direct</p>
              <p>143M is a waste because</p>
              <p>- The combination of 51, 78, 79, 143 were able to manage the load very well between Teban/Pandan to JE</p>
              <p>- 143M is just added capacity that is taking away loading from other services. As I mentioned if 143M comes first, it will go full to the interchange. If it comes after 79/143, it will go empty all the way back. Many times you will see 143, 143M, 79 all one after another.</p>
              <p>- 79 did job of 143M with mostly DDs... as it comes empty from Buroh so a good 60-70 pax would board in Teban to JE if 143 not ahead. Now 143M is also added. </p>

              <div>- 201 has its unique loadings now instead of just stealing pax from 79/143 in Teban - even when there's 79 in front, it still picked up 15 pax from Teban Gardens</div>

              <p>I wonder, are Ngee Ann and SIM students (together with other pax at Clementi Rd) really satisfied with buses to Clementi MRT? Or is the demand to Dover MRT actually higher?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, at 5.30pm or so, I was on 154 at Clementi Rd towards Clementi MRT. There was a 184 bendy in front so the 154 DD that I was taking did not receive that much loading at Ngee Ann / SIM (although it did get full upper deck in the end). What's the most surprising is that, a 74 DD was following my 154, and at almost every stop, it received a HUGE amount of pax.</p>
              <p>Like at Ngee Ann and SIM, 5-10 pax each took 154 while 50-60 pax took 74... There were people who deliberately waited for 74, and there were also people who was originally ready to board 154, but switch to 74 after seeing it. And this is when a 184 bendy had already called at the stops &lt;1min ago.</p>
              <p>In the end (at somewhere after Holland Rd), the 74 DD skipped one bus stop and overtook 154, even when there were 10+ pax waiting at the bus stop. Guess it's because the 74 was already packed to the door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the question is, is the demand over there more towards Clementi MRT or Dover MRT? Maybe many people actually want to go to/from Dover MRT, but are forced to use Clementi MRT (especially in AM) because of poor frequency on 74, versus 3 services with good frequency and capacity from Clementi.</p>

              <p>Most people going to NP or SIM would prefer to take  bus at Clementi MRT Station instead of Dover MRT Station. The reason is because it is faster to get on a bus.</p>
                                      <p>I observe a few times that a large crowd at Clementi MRT Station bus stop is dispersed after around three buses come and go, within ten minutes.</p>
                                      <p>Whereas for the return part, I do know of people who take 154 all the way to Boon Lay, although they could take the MRT halfway, as they want to see the expensive cars at the show-room somewhere at Teban Gardens area, to remind themselves to study hard, so that next time can make big money, buy luxury car, buy condo., etcetera.</p>
                                      <p>On a serious note, I got read before complaints about the heavy traffic jam at Clementi Road in the evening (around 6pm) towards the MRT tracks, about people being stuck in the road for a very long time. Meanwhile, Jalan Jurong Kechil and Bukit Batok that side  (where 174 and 157 are) also have traffic congestion problem at that same time.</p>
                                      <p>Bus lanes is an obvious solution. Other than that, it is to take in the reverse direction to Bukit Panjang, etcetera., where the traffic is more smooth. </p>
