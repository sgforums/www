              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, for the return journey, I do not foresee many people from Punggol alighting at TPE stop on sengkang side. Why? It is not a direct service as it is only a so called supplementary service to a minor section of the residents living next to TPE. Most people will prefer sbs 34 which goes inside Punggol. So it is not perceived as a major threat to sbs 27 and all those who are going to sengkang and hougang from CGA. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, I know 109 journey well as I often take it. I agree this is a fast way from loyang to sengkang. Sbs 89 also goes from loyang to sengkang but it leaves at a slip road earlier. Sbs 109 leaves at the next slip road towards sengkang hawker centre along sengkang east road. But then not much difference except for 3 mins more. The convenience brought upon to other sections of sengkang residents will be much more felt for sbs 109 to stop there. In your so called same neighbourhood, there are people living at other blocks next to TPE. Those new blocks at the edge of TPE, those currently built BTO blocks next to the temple and coffeehouse and the rental blocks and those flats inside rivervale crescent are within walking distance will benefit. Currently they do not benefit. So why not? Remember they should not be deprived of this service. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes I agree loading patterns will change. At
              first moment, I think the crowds along Punggol road 1st stop before
              TPE and after TPE will drop. Sbs 83 loading will drop slightly as
              some people will take sbs 3 and sbs 34 to the new stop to change to
              other buses. Currently Punggol residents take sbs 83 to Punggol
              road blk 190C stop or walk over to blk 298A to change buses. I
              foresee sbs 161 loading towards woodlands will also drop as it will
              be complemented by sbs 168, smrt 858 and smrt 969 slightly. Even
              sbs 85 and smrt 965 loading will be affected as the journey to
              yishun is covered by smrt 969. Sbs 34 loading will drop as smrt 858
              brings people directly to Changi airport after TPE stop. Sbs 27
              loading may or may not drop slightly and we shall see later. There
              will be many new links created. Examples are links to seletar camp,
              sembawang mrt and many more! Cheers.</p>

              <p>You know you have almost said all bus service loading will drop except SMRT services 858/969. And to an extent I agree. Will 969 and 858 be able to manage extra load?? It is already utilized to its capacity. This means there will be need for significant addition of buses.. Hopefully more high cap buses on 969.  I feel 161 loading will still stay as it is quick option to WDL unless people move to 168.. </p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, with the upcoming implementation of the new bus stop at TPE, the pros will surely outweigh the cons. It is naturally good for the loading pattern to slightly alter and also this will help to take away a bit traffic from the crowded Punggol road (blk 190C and blk 298A stops). Of course depending on exact locations of their flats, most will flock to sbs 161 to woodlands and a few will go to sbs 168 to woodlands. Actually by having one more stop at each side of the TPE, the impact on the bus routes will not be extremely great. Of course, after 3 months of implementation, there will be a routine change in loading and it will be great to see how it pans out later on. As such, new routes may still go to sengkang and Punggol not because of the sudden change in loading due to the bus stops but more because of increasing population in the 2 estates. With more flats, naturally more new bus services will come. So it will be good to make a distinction between 'loading change due to TPE stops' and 'increased loading due to more flats and people'. However sometimes they overlap and cannot be clearly demarcated out. Cheers</p>

              <p>109 SDs during peak will get packed to the door, even after reaching Sengkang. And may I ask how many DDs are actually running on 109? Proportionately the SDs would be more... </p>
              <p>On the other hand, 89 has much more DDs than SDs during peak. In fact, you wont even find any SDs during peak on some weekday evenings on 89! As for the DDs most of the time the standees won't even fill up half the lower deck. All seats taken though. </p>
              <p>Now in terms of ROUTE. Which makes more sense: coming up, stopping at stop and then resume as per normal or come up, stop, wait for jam and traffic light, go down, and UP AGAIN?! I could NOT think of a single route that would ultimately make 109 worth the stop. All I think it does is destroy one of the main advantages of 109. </p>

              reaching Sengkang. And may I ask how many DDs are actually running
              on 109? Proportionately the SDs would be more... </p>
              <p>On the other hand, 89 has much more DDs than SDs during peak. In
              fact, you wont even find any SDs during peak on some weekday
              evenings on 89! As for the DDs most of the time the standees won't
              even fill up half the lower deck. All seats taken though. </p>
              <p>Now in terms of ROUTE. Which makes more sense: coming up,
              stopping at stop and then resume as per normal or come up, stop,
              wait for jam and traffic light, go down, and UP AGAIN?! I could NOT
              think of a single route that would ultimately make 109 worth the
              stop. All I think it does is destroy one of the main advantages of
              109. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, sbs 89 has more double deckers because it is a loop service and crowds are expected to be more. Sbs 109 is fixed at 2 sides so uses single deck. With surge in crowds lately, double deckers are used. </p>
              <p>Sbs 109 still retains the main advantage even after it stops at TPE stop. Why? The whole sector is still express except for this stop. Other services also stop here but most have to stop at all stops on their normal routes while sbs 109 is still express for quite a distance. It still wins in terms of bus journey timing. Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi mr BusAnalyser, I think the main reason is they know that sbs
              27 has one of the highest frequencies. I have also told SMB128B
              before. This should be the main factor why they decide sbs 27 to
              remain its current way. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Agreed Sv 27 has a great frequency but you have to also identify with the woes of the people.</p>
              <p>1. Sv 27 bunches more than it does not. 2-3 buses together is common. Especially at Tampinee Reg Library towards Hougang, you will see 3 buses in PM turning in from tam ave 4. As you are aware, people all flog into the first bus. This way first two buses get 70 pax, next buses that come go empty. Very common. You realize people go standing, sticking to each other for 20-25 mins of their journey. Can be avoided by putting lesser buses no roads and having DDs leaving from Tampines interchange instead on 27M.</p>
              <p>2. CGA does not need 3-4 minute frequency. The loading there is pretty low. Hence, 27 can have frequency of 8-10 mins to CGA and 27M can have frequency of 6-8 mins from Tampines Interchange with DDs. </p>
              <p>Lta should seriously consider this, and this decision will very well be welcome by people. </p>

              <p>Sbs 109 has to wait for traffic light at junction. Right. After few mins, it will still move pasr traffic light and goes express again before turning left to sengkang east road. This express portion makes up time lost for the traffic light, correct? </p>

              <p>No need to doubt my credibility as a whole. Sbs 109 will benefit many sengkang residents living near the TPE. To them, convenience will be much more important than my credibility.

              <p>Hi mr sbs 3688Y, I think will not in the long run. Firstly, the
              roads are expanded when they add the bus stops. Secondly, most of
              the cars will use the direct flyover. Only cars turning into
              sengkang and Punggol will use the slip roads. Thirdly, we do not
              expect huge crowds of people at the TPE stops. Even though there
              are more residential units coming up, some of the passengers may
              have taken bus services originating from roads inside sengkang and
              Punggol. They do not have to depend on the bus services at TPE bus
              stops all the time. For those residents living just besides or
              within waking distance of the TPE stops and having no cars of their
              own, congrats to them. It will be like an MRT to them! Cheers</p>
                            </div>
              
              hi Mr dupdup77, how come the new bus-stops are built along the slip roads instead of next to TPE; why not follow the AYE bus-stops? for buses travelling up the slip road towards Yishun direction, these buses got to cut from leftmost lanes to rightmost lanes to get into TPE; while vehicles from TPE will compete to cut into the leftmost lane to Sengkang East Rd. also; travelling up &amp; down the slip roads incur additional travel time.

                  its terrible that the authorities are not trying to create a DD friendly and also aircon bus terminal at CGA. now most buses are suffering from loss of productivity as they csnt deploy ADDs. when the new bus-stops along TPE Punggol opens, sv858 loading is going to get worse. and we still got another Terminal 4 coming up soon.

              <p>Hi mr SBS3688Y, i believe i do not know the actual reasons. I analyse the road situations around that area and came to conclude that when they build the TPE, there is no intention of building bus stops. Only when population increases, then they decide to build. However, the exact locations of the stops were perceived that it must maximise to the convenience of most passengers and surrounding residents. As with current location near to slip roads, they decide to even incorporate current overhead bridges and extend them out.</p>
              <p>For buses to travel from leftmost to rightmost lanes, i believe not all the services are affected. Only a few! They are left with not much of a choice other than to manuover on the road which they should have some luxury of time.</p>
              <p>For vehicles competing to cut into sengkang east road, they are already doing it now. Not much related. Moreover, sbs 109 is the only service that goes by this road after finishing TPE.</p>
              <p>Yes travelling up and down slip roads incurs additional time. That is one of the cons. In any way, this happens to the buses. Cars are not affected. </p>

              <p>I'm surprised that it is on a slope... Will it cause problems for traffic exiting at the slip road?</p>
