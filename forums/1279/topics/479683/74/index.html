              <p><br> DTL2's frequency keeps changing.... During the free rides period it
              was running at a steady 3 mins frequency. A few days
              after free rides ended frequency became 4 mins. But just this
              morning (7am+) frequency was 2-3 mins in both directions and was
              quite consistent. Is it because there's a school holiday schedule
              or something?</p>
              <p>Regarding its loading, maybe it's due to DTL's frequency. Guess
              LTA/SBST realised the mistake of using 3-car trains for
              DTL and hence bought excess trains, and thus 2 mins
              frequency to mitigate the expected huge crowds. If DTL
              was to run at NEL's frequency or even CCL's frequency, we may see
              trains packed to the door.</p>
              <p>(Also take note that DTL's loading seems to be better in the
              city, between various interchanges, rather than between Bukit
              Panjang and the city.)</p>

              <p>It's mainly condos and landed properties all the way along the roads of (Upp) Bt Timah Rd and Dunearn Rd, except some HDB estates at Bt Panjang &amp; Beauty World, and schools at TKK &amp; Stevens. Of course we don't get as much demand as NEL.</p>
              <p>Though when DTL3 opens, that could be another story.</p>

              <p>For those boarding at Tanah Merah MRT towards Marine Parade, although the crowds are quite messive, they would still take 31/48 if there's no 47... Plus many 48 buses will be empty when arriving at Tanah Merah. Maybe 47 there is good to relieve loads on 31/48, although I wouldn't say it's that necessary.</p>

              <p>Do you think it could be because till now people were relying on private operator buses to ferry them to Tanah Merah just like for Alps Ave before extension of sv 35. It could be that these people have bought a one year pass already. Just speculating, not sure. Wiill be great if someone has more info.</p>

              <p>Was this bus a DD or SD? It seems like 69 pax peak is not bad for a bus that is not even one month old. I can only expect loading to increase from changi business park. </p>

              <p><br>For 28, actually many pax alight at first stop at Bedok North Ave 3. Some alight at later parts of Ave 3 but I'm not sure how many will really travel all the way to Tampines. There's 67 from Bedok MRT to Ave 3, plus many other services from Bedok Int, so I guess it's fine.</p>
              <p>Agree that 28 has massive crowds between Tampines and Bedok. But now for Tampines Ave 9 / St 45 you also have 293 that come at 3 min frequency plus 293P (especially during PM peak). AM peak may be the problem because those at St 45 closer to Ave 9 will choose 28 instead of 293.</p>
              <p>So I think current fleet can more or less manage, although having fleet adds may be useful.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* The loading is for everyone to see. I don't think 256 is as useless as everyone have remarked because it does have DD worthy between Pioneer and Pioneer Road North (though also has 193/251 plying the same route) but 256 gives direct Pioneer MRT connectivity.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Do we even need 256 to be there between Pioneer and Boon Lay? It operates with almost 0 pax to &lt;10 pax (those who can also take 243G/W). Also st 61 is like a ghost bus stop with no one boarding/alighting, guess because Pioneer MRT is so close.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* 256 can be routed as Joo Koon &lt;&gt; Pioneer MRT service. This way it can be more efficient and not get stuck in the long queue of buses entering Boon Lay.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Observed frequency is around 14-16 mins per bus. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Peak loading 1st trip: 37, 2nd trip: 68 (44 upper deck, 24 lower deck), 3rd trip: 32</p>

              see. I don't think 256 is as useless as everyone have remarked
              because it does have DD worthy between Pioneer and Pioneer Road
              North (though also has 193/251 plying the same route) but 256 gives
              direct Pioneer MRT connectivity.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Do we even need 256 to be there
              between Pioneer and Boon Lay? It operates with almost 0 pax to
              &lt;10 pax (those who can also take 243G/W). Also st 61 is like a
              ghost bus stop with no one boarding/alighting, guess because
              Pioneer MRT is so close.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* 256 can be routed as Joo Koon
              &lt;&gt; Pioneer MRT service. This way it can be more efficient and
              not get stuck in the long queue of buses entering Boon Lay.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Observed frequency is around
              14-16 mins per bus. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">* Peak loading 1st trip: 37, 2nd
              trip: 68 (44 upper deck, 24 lower deck), 3rd trip: 32</p>

              <p>Better to downgrade to SD? It does seem SD is enough for the route during peak hours. Let alone off-peak hours.</p>

              <p>My proposal is to make it Joo Koon Interchange &lt;&gt; Pioneer MRT (loop). There is 68 pax boarding on way to Pioneer MRT. That does qualify to get DD. Fleet size is only 5 buses operating at 14-16 mins frequency. If someone is not able to board, have to wait another 15 mins, so from that point of view, I am okay with DDs deployed, but the stretch between Pioneer and Boon Lay seems waste of fuel and resource. Can just have 4 DDs do Joo Koon &lt;&gt; Pioneer. </p>

              <p>Freq of buses plying industrial estates always sucks. Yes 975 does need more buses. Maybe can downroute from depot instead of bukit panjang as bukit panjang area always jam, delaying 975</p>

              <p><br> So half the pax boarding at CBP alight at Tanah Merah... The other

              <p>For those boarding at Tanah Merah MRT towards Marine Parade,
              although the crowds are quite messive, they would still take 31/48
              if there's no 47... Plus many 48 buses will be empty when arriving
              at Tanah Merah. Maybe 47 there is good to relieve loads on 31/48,
              although I wouldn't say it's that necessary.</p>

              <p>Absolutely, I took 47 from before Tanah Merah MRT at about 6.05pm. 47, 38 &amp; 12 arrived at the same time. 47 was last. Counted about 5 people boarding the bus. Most of the demand is actually NOT to MP but really between CBP, TNM and Bedok South. Of course, this is contingent upon it arriving without any competition at TNM. </p>

              Loading on 189, during morning peak @ Clementi MRT to Nan Hua high school:
              
              always very full, students always stranded, left with only other svcs to take, some buses are extreemly overpacked, some not so cause they dw to move to the rear. Today there was some improvement, DDs were deployed instead of usual SDs. Students waiting at Blk 317 or before, can't board cause bus from bbt load is packed to door. DD takes about 5-6mins to unload all pax at school. To be honest, DD or BD doesn't really matter, what matters is bringing people to school ON time. 
              
              Obs today saw many people taking bus 183, 106. 
              Pretty much every 189 gets overloaded. 
              
              perhaps they can get DDs to downrt from 1 stop before Clementi station or operate 106A to Nan Hua high or make 106A change eds to 189 @ Clementi station?

              <p>Service 43 is getting worse this year compared to 2015. SDs on 43M will arrive packed to the door, then one minute later, DDs on 43 will appear. This is even worse than bunching of 43 and 43M with one SD and one DD! There is no bus that departs Punggol at 6.35 am, or 3 minutes before or after, on both 43 and 43M. Something has to be done about the crowd of students at 6.50 am at Sengkang and Punggol. Many students were left stranded at Buangkok Green because of this pig-brained deployment of SBS6500K 2 minutes before SBS3105M. The previous bus before these two is SBS3458U and SBS3003Z, that bunch very often and leave 15-17 minutes before either SBS6500K or SBS3105M.</p>
              <p>SBS6500K also gets huge school crowds in the afternoon. It's time that LTA does something about this and upgrade SBS6500K.</p>
