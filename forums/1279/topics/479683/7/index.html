              <p>6:30 to 7:25 no high loading to upper Paya Lebar - please!! Yes,
                  agreed high loading towards Kovan MRT in am and after 6pm towards
                  Lor ah Soo.. But really the loading can be managed by SDs..
                  Witnessed so many times,.. Or like said before just use 2 returning
                  DDs to HG interchange to do 1-2 rounds of 113A before heading off

              <p>Yes there are a huge demand of students boarding 113 towards hougang ave 1 and lor ah soo. After that, if 62 havent arrive at the bus stops along lorong ah soo, pax commuting to upper paya lebar/ tai seng would take 113 to upp paya lebar road and xfer to 22,24,70,76 and 80. AM peak mostly students would flood 62 and 113 from hougang  side to hougang ave 1. Students boarding 113 at hougang st 21 cant board thanks to ppl who boarded at kovan and hougang side. And the next bus is like 15mins and another one is full. If you notice, quite a number of yuying sec students would walk from kovan station if they cant board 113.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, this could be attributed to the fact that sbs 62 journey from Punggol to geylang lor 1 and back is easily 2 hours. The routes along sbs 62 can easily pick up many loadings along the way. They pass by many different parts of the HDB estates, giving it enough passengers even if other bus services went past them. So I think the bus drivers prefer to drive at the recommended speed and give other services take some of the loadings. Cheers.</p>

              <p>62 loading very high AM from Punggol to Geylang and similarly PM from Geylang to Punggol. Opposite direction loading is quite poor. Hence, this service still has a high number of 7 SDs and is one of the few service that even after BSEP has not got capacity upgrade or addition.</p>
              <p>But 62 SDs should be timed for off-peak direction. Many times SDs are in the peak direction around 6pm towards Punggol, which does not make sense as bus gets super crowded becoming late and DD behind then takes lesser pax. Also forces pax to then take other bus and transfer. Should be avoided.</p>

              <p>I think 136's dd same situation as 119.</p>
              <p>I joyrided 136's VSO ytd morning from Punggol INT and there were less than 30 pax from punggol to kovan station. After kovan station, the dd was left with 4-6pax all the way to ang mo kio int (my friend who boarded Sv 136 along upper serangoon road told me that.) The ironic thing is not many people moved up to the upper deck.</p>
              <p>If the dd is there for students which only 1-2 buses are packed then i think 136A (terminating at kovan station or opp hougang plaza will do).</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, i alighted at kovan station and observed 3 Sv 113s towards upper paya lebar. (6.45am - 7.25am). Two buses were fully packed with students to the door while the 3rd bus, that reached around 7.25am was fully seated. I feel that 113A can follow 159A/B's style in the morning should operate from kovan station - yuying sec school (terminate here) and 113B Upper paya lebar road - Kovan Station (terminate here). Can add 1 more bus or crossover buses from 115/325. Maybe 115 bc can do 1 trip of 113A then start trip from hougang st 21. Kovan station &gt; Hougang Ave 1(Terminate here) &gt; Hougang St 22 &gt; Hougang Ave 3 &gt; Tampines Road &gt; Hougang St 21. </p>
              <p>3-4 113s (Including 113A) on the other side were fully packed to kovan station and the bus was left with only 10-20 pax after calling at kovan station. If 62 has called before 113 along Lorong Ah Soo/Hougang Ave 1, i think only 10pax at most after kovan station. I dont really know the demand for AM peak from hougang side to kovan station but i would go and observe it someday.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, I don't agree with sbs 136 terminating at kovan station or opposite hougang mrt area (take note hougang plaza is no longer there and the site is being taken over by midtown residences). Firstly, if sbs 136 terminates at kovan station, then there will be no major differences between sbs 82, sbs 119, sbs 136 all originating from Punggol, save for some minor routes difference. Secondly, I observe crowds along upper serangoon road taking sbs 136 to serangoon garden way. The linkage between Punggol, sengkang, hougang, to serangoon gardens (chomp chomp area) must be maintained as it serves a vital loading. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I always find how every time u justify high loading on 113 while all others who take it don't find the same exaggerated loading as you mention. And then you go to say how other services don't need DDs. Last time you pointed 101 doesn't need DDs. Please take the service peak time few times and you will know 101 DDs already have 70+ pax on st 51 am peak send 70+ pax at HG MRT PM peak.</p>

              <p>I think 136's dd same situation as 119.</p>
              <p>I joyrided 136's VSO ytd morning from Punggol INT and there were
              less than 30 pax from punggol to kovan station. After kovan
              station, the dd was left with 4-6pax all the way to ang mo kio int
              (my friend who boarded Sv 136 along upper serangoon road told me
              that.) The ironic thing is not many people moved up to the upper
              deck.</p>
              <p>If the dd is there for students which only 1-2 buses are packed
              then i think 136A (terminating at kovan station or opp hougang
              plaza will do).</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, i alighted at kovan station and observed 3 Sv 113s
              towards upper paya lebar. (6.45am - 7.25am). Two buses were fully
              packed with students to the door while the 3rd bus, that reached
              around 7.25am was fully seated. I feel that 113A can follow
              159A/B's style in the morning should operate from kovan station -
              yuying sec school (terminate here) and 113B Upper paya lebar road -
              Kovan Station (terminate here). Can add 1 more bus or crossover
              buses from 115/325. Maybe 115 bc can do 1 trip of 113A then start
              trip from hougang st 21. Kovan station &gt; Hougang Ave 1(Terminate
              here) &gt; Hougang St 22 &gt; Hougang Ave 3 &gt; Tampines Road &gt;
              Hougang St 21. </p>
              <p>3-4 113s (Including 113A) on the other side were fully packed to
              kovan station and the bus was left with only 10-20 pax after
              calling at kovan station. If 62 has called before 113 along Lorong
              Ah Soo/Hougang Ave 1, i think only 10pax at most after kovan
              station. I dont really know the demand for AM peak from hougang
              side to kovan station but i would go and observe it someday.</p>

              <p>Also for record, I have taken 136 DDs twice before to analyze. I didn't find a huge crowd but around Sengkang it did have 70/75 pax. Rest of the route loading was between 45/55 pax. So either there was a 136 just ahead or again it is an exaggerated situation. 136 has only 2 trips in am with crossover, not also perm DDs - so let them be. If 113 really needed DDs - LTA / SBST would have given them DDs or fleet add longggg back. So please stop posting about 113 henceforth.</p>

              <p>Hi mr sbst191, I don't agree with sbs 136 terminating at kovan
              station or opposite hougang mrt area (take note hougang plaza is no
              longer there and the site is being taken over by midtown
              residences). Firstly, if sbs 136 terminates at kovan station, then
              there will be no major differences between sbs 82, sbs 119, sbs 136
              all originating from Punggol, save for some minor routes
              difference. Secondly, I observe crowds along upper serangoon road
              taking sbs 136 to serangoon garden way. The linkage between
              Punggol, sengkang, hougang, to serangoon gardens (chomp chomp area)
              must be maintained as it serves a vital loading. Thanks. </p>

              would be good, rather than sharing resources. </p>
              <p>Maybe SBS926E from 115 can do 113A 1 round before going back
              depot?</p>

              <p>My dear... There are only 2 trips during the whole day when DDs run on Sv 136. I can tell you these are timed for all schools around Sengkang. You can already see 70+ pax on 136 towards Sengkang from Punggol after which loading drops. Post Kovan agreed loAding is low. </p>

              <p>I am not against crossover for 113 - instead I have kept saying that you can also have crossover DDs from 107/153/89 that come back to HG and can do crossover trip on 113A just like 139A style before going back to depot.</p>
