              <p>40's loading will be similar. Main source will be between Bedok
              to Katong part of East Coast Rd. Siglap Rd loading will mostly come
              from Flamingo Valley. May have loading from Global Indian
              International Sch at that time as well. </p>
              <p>For 32 you missed loading for St Stephen's Sch at La Salle St
              (along Frankel Av). </p>
              <p>And yes, Frankel largely landed-property. I agree having only 1
              service is justifiable. But we cannot have routes for the sake of
              having them. 32 is quite useless because it doesn't connect
              Kembangan MRT. Only good for going Katong and does not connect
              amenities on Marine Parade. Very few residents from Frankel will go
              Bedok. Siglap Rd at least has 401 on weekends. </p>
              <p>If you have time, go try 42 from Opposite Kembangan Stn during
              evening peak hour. Most demand will be to Opera Estate. Very few
              going to Siglap Rd or Siglap Dr. Compare to morning which will have
              higher demand between Siglap Dr to Kembangan because 42 is only
              one-way to Kembangan MRT. You will also see a lot more pax going
              into Kembangan Estate because got a lot of condo plus
              HDB. </p>
              <p>32 should just ply Telok Kurau. Katong-Bedok still intact where
              most demand is. Then new service from Kembangan to Marine Parade
              via Frankel. Frankel Av still got only 1 service but at least more
              useful than 32, plus sure got demand from Kembangan to Marine
              Parade. </p>

              <p>Going to Kembangan, most people will take 42, as it is more direct and frequent. On the way back, 32 does not serve Kembangan, and 42 can take up to 13-15 mins plus waiting time even longer. 42 will go Opera first via Sims Av East, used to ply Frankel 2-ways before Siglap Dr become 1 way. Yes, can walk from Kembangan MRT to Frankel Av bus stop (Aft Frankel Terr). Must cross road 3 times, def not 5 mins. 32 freq also very poor, 16-18 mins evening peak D1. </p>
              <p>The most logical connection to for fast connection on public transport to the city is via MRT. Whether someone has a car is irrelevant. Like that, Frankel no need bus. Bukit Timah also no need MRT station. </p>

              <p>Don't expect high loading on 42 pls. It will be seated loading. Opera Estate will be like Serangoon Gardens, a lot of terrace houses. </p>
              <p>You will notice much higher loading at Lengkong 3/4 due to HDBs &amp; condo. That side will have standees. </p>
              <p>Also note, 42 has very erratic frequency. It can range from 7-20 mins. I suggest you check the timetable for departures from Kembangan Stn. If less than 10 mins between buses, surely very poor loading. If 15-20 mins interval, you will definitely get better loading. Dont' worry, timetable is very accurate for such a short route like 42. </p>
              <p>1845 &amp; 1855 hrs departure from Kembangan Stn is quite packed. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">For 40 you will see similar loading patterns to 32, maybe higher loading because it is more frequent. </span></p>

              <p>Loading is very bad in part also because 42 goes in and out of Fidelio St, you should have observed this when you took the bus, that going from Siglap Dr to Kembangan MRT is MUCH shorter than coming from Kembangan.

In fact, it is unusual that Flamingo Valley got most of the loading, because most people prefer the more direct 40 from Bedok Int. </p>
              <p>BUT, if you have read my postings, you wouldn't be talking over my head about loadings. I have never argued for a new service because 42 is facing capacity issues. That will NEVER happen. I am focused on CONNECTIVITY. In this case, providing a reliable form of link TO &amp; FROM Kembangan MRT. For most residents, 42 only provides a one-way connection TO Kembangan MRT. Even though commuters can take the bus FROM Kembangan MRT all the way to Siglap Dr/Frankel Av, I don't know if you would've noticed that it is an EXTREMELY LONG-WINDED WAY of doing so. Maybe you were TOO FOCUSED on loadings. I will demonstrate this by showing that demand TO Kembangan MRT from Fidelio/Frankel is always HIGHER than demand FROM Kembanagan MRT to Fidelio/Frankel, by recording the loadings for both sectors on Monday. </p>
              <p>Go que for taxis at Kembangan MRT, you will find that most residents are taking taxis to Siglap/Frankel estates. </p>
              <p>The best is if 42 can ply Frankel Av on both sides, then go up Siglap Dr &gt; Siglap Rd&gt; Fidelio St, and then loop back. But this cannot be done because Siglap Dr is one-way. So, you cannot amend 42, period. </p>

              <p>Hi Mr. SBS6465E,</p>
              <p>Understand your frustration with the lack of bus services in Frankel area as I often frequent there too. However I often head to the end nearer to east coast road where it's still walkable to more services such as 10,12 etc. However, I feel that it's pretty difficult to plan routes serving the entire Frankel estate (other than tweaking bus 42, which is hard due to the fact that many more inaccessible areas will be affected). I feel that it's probably due to the assumption that people staying along Frankel will commute via car/taxi as the pathetic frequency of 32 (could wait up to 25mins if suay) can frustrate people hugely.</p>
              <p>Also, proposing an alternative route (say from Eunos) will not be really viable either since you'll only get the link FROM kembangan and not TO kembangan from frankel.  </p>
              <p>I guess the only way to get about the poor transport links about the estate would be to appeal for an improved frequency for 32 (say during peak timings), I believe for 40 as well, in order to cater to the needs for commuters who still ply via public transport. Just sharing my two cents worth. Cheers!</p>

              <p>From my observation, 258 loading from Gek Poh to Boon Lay is dependent on which bus comes first: 181, 243W or 258 as I spotted SBS3T on 181 at the junction before the Blk 762 bus stop while I was on 3487K. In the case where 181 came first, 258 would not have much loading towards Boon Lay as most likely it would just pick up any passanger that missed the previous bus.</p>

              was on 3487K. In the case where 181 came first, 258 would not have
              much loading towards Boon Lay as most likely it would just pick up
              any passanger that missed the previous bus.</p>

              <p>Demand on 258 has been lower than expected. The St 81/82 - Boon Lay loading depends very much on whether 243 has called the stop or not. Given 243 has peak frequency of 03-04 mins, it is likely that there will always be a 243 in front of a 258.</p>
              <p>The Pioneer MRT - st 81/82 loading has failed to pick up. Most loading still comes from Joo Koon only during industrial hours to Jurong West Town. </p>

              <p>Personally, I also felt that 258's loading is quite disappointing as I thought 258 will take off some loading from 243 where commuters board from Pioneer to St 81 instead of from Boon Lay to St 81.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I feel that 258 can downgrade the DDs to a full SD fleet while adding 1-2 SDs to boost frequency as 258 loading from St 81 to Boon Lay is dependent on whether there is a 243 (or 181 starting from Gek Poh) in front of it.</span></p>
              <p>Though 258 have decent loading during PM peak for the Joo Koon - Pioneer MRT stretch as the Jurong Camp bus stop have quite good loading, but it also depends if 192 or 258 comes first as both ply the same route to Pioneer.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Usually, the bottom deck is packed but the upper deck is not well utilised as most people alight at Pioneer MRT.</span></p>
              <p>I have also observed that 192 gets more loading at Jurong Camp bus stop compared to 258 as 192 takes the "direct" route to Boon Lay Interchange for passangers transferring to the other buses at the interchange.</p>

              <p>* Surprised to see such poor loading between Punggol and
                      Sengkang towns</p>
              <p>* Loading mainly for 83 comes for 3 stops along Punggol Central
                      like a feeder bus</p>
              <p>* Opposite direction spotted 2 buses towards Punggol both empty.
                      One at Compassalve St had less than 20 pax on board also.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, this is the reason why sbs 83 must start from Punggol interchange to loop at sengkang instead of reversing to start from Sengkang interchange. Finally, all should realize Sbs 83 is very crucial in serving huge sectors of residents along Punggol central. Cheers. Thanks. </p>
