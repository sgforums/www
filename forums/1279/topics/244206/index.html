Henceforth, all adjustments will be from October,' the PTC spokesman added.<br><br>As for the 1.8 per cent cap this year, it is based on a formula that takes into account current economic conditions, average wage increases as well as productivity gains of the public transport companies. It also allows fares to be lowered when the economy is in deep recession.<br><br>Both operators declined to say if they will ask for a fare increase, but it remains to be seen whether the planned two-percentage-point rise in goods and services tax (GST) in July will influence the decision.<br><br>A two-point rise in GST to 7 per cent translates to about $22 million in additional cost to the two operators.<br><br>Singapore introduced GST in 1994, starting with a 3 per cent levy. It was raised to 4 per cent in 2003, and 5 per cent in 2004.<br><br>Although GST was never passed on directly to public transport commuters, it is computed indirectly in the fare adjustment formula, which takes inflation - represented by the Consumer Price Index - into consideration.<br><br>SMRT spokesman Goh Chee Kong said: 'The fare adjustment formula takes care of wage increases, Consumer Price Index and productivity. So any increase in GST will be accounted for in the Consumer Price Index.'<br><br>In the past two years, the operators cited higher oil prices as the main justification for a fare rise.<br><br>A senior transport analyst said GST had never been fully passed on to commuters, but added that 'the formula will prevail because we are not in a deflationary economy'.</div>
