            <div class='col-md body'>Usually, SBS would buy a similar bus to replace the outgoing bus. For example, the B10M was a replacement for the B57 while the O405 were for the OF1413/1417. I feel that the B9TL was the long overdue replacement for the 200 LO 2X. It makes a bit of sense as SBS purchased 50 B10TL and this is followed by the initial order of 150 B9TL. I feel we will see the arrival of a new stepless entry SD in the future for the B10M Mk-II. A Volvo model (again) is expected of course, but, who knows, we might also see one from another manufacturer.</div>

Its just that the time hasn't come for the SD yet. The last withdrawal were for the LO2X, so here are their replacements. Next up, we will likely see new SD for the Mk II, N113 and O405 over the next 3-5 years. Patience please.<br><br>1688 and 2888 were trial buses. Its good to try out something new (in this case, stepless buses) before deciding to push forward and buy in bulk. Some trial buses had proven their worth while many others had failed.

If they had really bought that bus, we would have heard news about a SD WABs. And if you think that the thread is NOT a rumor but a Fact, Why dont YOU show me dsome concrete prove that it is a Fact and that SBST is buying that particular model ? My dear boy, theres alot stuffs that you dont know. I would prefer that you go open up your history textbook, revise on them before you come in here again.</div>
