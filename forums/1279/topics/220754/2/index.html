Its just that the time hasn't come for the SD yet. The last withdrawal were for the LO2X, so here are their replacements. Next up, we will likely see new SD for the Mk II, N113 and O405 over the next 3-5 years. Patience please.<br><br>1688 and 2888 were trial buses. Its good to try out something new (in this case, stepless buses) before deciding to push forward and buy in bulk. Some trial buses had proven their worth while many others had failed. SBST has already bought more B10BLE. The Gassies, remember? I won't be surprised if SBST introduce a WAB SD after the B9TL. </div></blockquote>Since the Aussies are great fans of the L94UB, maybe SBST can sell off their only one.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If they had ordered new buses, we would be seeing them by on the roads by NOW !<br><br>Secondly, i did NOT said that you was stressing that there were new buses bought.

You need a dictionary to help you check up the word Fantasy and rumor ??<br><br>Lastly.. Did i EVER said that i was only interested in bus rides, bus cameos and route amendment ? DID I SAY THAT ?
