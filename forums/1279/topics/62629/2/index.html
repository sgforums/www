            <div class='col-md body'>well.. i'm definitely sure it's from Ang Mo Kio Int and it loops at Chin Swee Rd, probably serving Chinatown area.. it is described in a booklet that introduces new services running from the new Ang Mo Kio Bus Int that is located opposite Ang Mo Kio MRT Station.. but it's in 1983, which is 20 years ago.. my poor memory suggests it's a 1X8 (138 or 168?).. i was thinking if it could it be the predecessor of SBST 168 that from what we know once plied between Ang Mo Kio and Orchard Rd as it could go to Chin Swee Rd via Clemenceau Ave?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was also trying to find out the service in Chin Swee Rd but to no avail. but anyway i've jus uncovered an old Singapore City map of 1989 with the bus numbers that ply which road listed on the map. It is not comprehensive, but i try to make out what is shown, and hope someone out there actually knows the route. I don't have time to read up on the previous threads on any of these services until perhaps later in the day, but i'll jus state them down anyway. These are my findings (it's late in the night and i'm tired, so i won't really elaborate, jus listing):<br><br>* Chin Swee Rd had no bus services listed on the map.<br><br>* It appears that service 2 used to ply beyond New Bridge Rd from the eastern area towards the west beyond Commonwealth via Jalan Bt Merah and Queensway.<br><br>* It appears that there was a fully air-conditioned service 3 that used to ply from the eastern area towards the west beyond Commonwealth via Geylang, Kallang Rd, North Bridge Rd/Victoria St, Chinatown, Kampong Bahru Rd, Jalan Bt Merah and Queensway.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 28 that operates from New Bridge Rd Ter to some area in the east, via Eu Tong Sen St/South Bridge Rd, Hill St, Victoria St/North Bridge Rd, Kallang Rd, Sims Ave/Geylang Rd, and continue towards the east.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 41 that operates from Bukit Merah Int to some area in the east, probably Bedok, via Jalan Bt Merah, Kampong Bahru Rd, Tiong Bahru Rd, Outram Rd, Eu Tong Sen St/South Bridge Rd, Hill St, Victoria St/North Bridge Rd, Kallang Rd, Sims Ave/Geylang Rd, Mountbatten Rd, and continue towards the east.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 50 that operates from Bukit Merah Int to some area in the east, via Jalan Bt Merah, Kampong Bahru Rd, Tiong Bahru Rd, Outram Rd, Cantonment Rd, Anson Rd/Shenton Way, Robinson Rd/Raffles Quay, Collyer Quay, St. Andrew's Rd/Connaught Dr, Beach Rd, Crawford St, Kallang Rd, Sims Ave/Geylang Rd, and continue towards the east.<br><br>* It appears that services 61, 64 and 154 used to terminate at MacPherson Estate Terminal at Circuit Rd.<br><br>* It appears that service 71 from Old Yio Chu Kang Rd Terminal terminates at Geylang Lor 1 Terminal.<br><br>* It appears that service 72 used to ply Tanjong Rhu before SBST 158 took over.<br><br>* It appears that service 91 terminates at Geylang Lor 1 Terminal.<br><br>* It appears that service 103 used to ply beyond New Bridge Rd from the north-eastern area towards the west beyond Commonwealth via Outram Rd, Tiong Bahru Rd, Alexandra Rd and Commonwealth Ave.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 118 that operates from the north-eastern area to Tomlinson Rd, and from what i know, is the first air-con bus service in Singapore (SBST always have the ad on their LCD TVs in the NEL trains, "warm response to a cool ride", when they show the milestones they've been through)<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 124 used to ply Stevens Rd.<br><br>* It appears that service 167 used to terminate at World Trade Centre Terminal via Cantonment Rd, Kampong Bahru Rd and Telok Blangah Rd. Now it terminates at Bt Merah Int.<br><br>* Service 171 used to terminate at Queen St Terminal from Yishun during the SBS days (i remember clearly that now).<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 173 that operates from New Bridge Rd Ter to somewhere?<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 179 that operates from New Bridge Rd Ter to some area in the west, probably Jalan Anak Bt or Bt Panjang, via Chinatown, Stamford Rd/Bras Basah Rd, Orchard Rd/Orchard Boulevard, Scotts Rd, Bt Timah Rd/Dunearn Rd, and continue towards Jalan Anak Bt direction.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 180 that operates from World Trade Centre Ter to some area in the west, probably Jalan Anak Bt or Bt Panjang, via Keppel Rd, Shenton Way, Upp Cross St, Clemenceau Ave, Selegie Rd/Bencoolen St, Bt Timah Rd/Dunearn Rd and continue towards Jalan Anak Bt direction.<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 184 that operates from Bt Merah Int Ter to somewhere via Kampong Bahru Rd?<br><br>* It appears that there was a service 189 that used to ply from Marina Centre Terminal towards the west beyond Commonwealth via Shenton Way, Cantonment Rd, Neil Rd, Kampong Bahru Rd, Jalan Bt Merah and Queensway.<br><br>* It appears that service 198 used to terminate at Sims Drive Terminal, travelling past Aljuned Rd and Jalan Besar, operating to probably Boon Lay.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i went around the house searching but to no avail.. but i think it shld be service 168 which went from Ang Mo Kio to Chin Swee Rd and Chinatown via Orchard Rd before either EWL network rationalisation or the building of CTE tunnels along Chin Swee Rd put an end to it..<br><br>i went to take a look at my 1988 edition of the Singapore Street Directory and was amazed to find the page about bus services to major places of interests..!=)</div>

Forgot the date already.<br><br>Also Sv. 57 Bishan - Sector A.</div>
