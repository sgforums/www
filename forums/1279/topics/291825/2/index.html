            <div class='col-md body'>The reason are simple.To have more SL travel and experience other Interchanges and to save diesel.Nowadays SL are required to switch off the AC during Off Service.<br><br>One more funny thing for AMDEP SLs on these services.<br>61 have to go to BBT Int to apply leave.<br>169,965 &amp; 969 to WLD Int.<br>67 have to go CCK Int.<br>Last time got 3 Service Management Group(Route Group for SBST),Now left 2,Must change CEO to a man.<br>I dun think Geylang Lor 1 will be the bus park for these services.Only 2 Nissan and 14 Bus Plus buses are allowed to park there.Come to think of it 7 buses to WLDEP,4 AMDEP buses for 961 and probably 3 for 985,Not much difference.Apart from 853,854,855,804,806,811,812 and a few 859 buses park at Yishun,I think theres still space for the 12m to squeeze in.SMRT depots are like sardine.<br></div>
