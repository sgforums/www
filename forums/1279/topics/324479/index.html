              <p>1st Question : Do u think there are enough buses in SLBP to be deployed on 251 ? <br>2nd Question : Even if there are enough buses to bump up the freq. Are there enough BCs ?</p>

              <p>Think about it...</p>
              <p>p.s. 251 is consider very good. As compared to some Industrial Services up north with 2 perm bus only.</p>
