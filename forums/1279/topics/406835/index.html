              <p>Additional safety feature required. Awning not retracted, bus cannot move.</p>
              <p>Should be a feature whether raining or not, so that BC is not given any discretion in light rain. Might as well provide shade from the sun too</p>
              <p>Bus must run along side bus stop at a fixed gap, too wide or too near will not do.</p>
              <p>Bus must queue to properly dock at the bus stop, which means only max two buses at large bus stops and one at smaller bus stops.</p>
              <p>Bus laid up, because of awning mechanical failure, with all other aspects of the bus in good working order.</p>
              <p>People complain, with shelter still get wet, or haven't boarderd bus yet BC retracted awning, or have holes.</p>
              <p>Want red  or yellow covering. Red for importance, yellow for royalty, or with advertisements.  </p>
              <p>It is a good idea, like TV Mobile, but not practical.</p>
              <p>One more very very important detail, cannot miss out, has any other country done it. Incase does not work out, can say other countries also do it. </p>

              <p>Never think this was helpful at all.</p>
              <p>I would rather increase the height of the bus stop(for doubledeck buses) and the amount of the shelter let out on the busbay(which makes more sense than retractable shelters) than to put retractable shelters on the buses. If it's on the bus stop it's ok, but not on the bus. More mantainance needed.</p>

              <p>Never think this was helpful at all.</p>
              <p>I would rather increase the height of the bus stop(for doubledeck buses) and the amount of the shelter let out on the busbay(which makes more sense than retractable shelters) than to put retractable shelters on the buses. If it's on the bus stop it's ok, but not on the bus. More mantainance needed.</p>

              <p><br>What about designing a tunnel-like bus stop? Passengers can board and alight with the minimal chance of getting wet unless the road gets flooded. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi Bus-Enthusiasts! :D</p>
              <p>I'm a student doing a project which targets at improving the quality of buses. My friend recommended me this site and told me to come here to look for people's feedback and advice so your input would be of great help to me and my group! (:</p>
              <p>Basically, our main idea is to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSTALL A RETRACTABLE SHELTER</span></strong> at the <strong>ENTRANCE</strong> and <strong>EXIT</strong> of the public buses.</p>
              <p>The retractable shelters will resemble like those at coffee shops, maybe just different designs.</p>
              <p>The main purpose of this shelter is to prevent people from <strong>GETTING WET</strong> during the rainy days when they board and alight the bus. Further more, people do not need to open their umbrellas when they enter the bus and make the floor wet and dirty.</p>
              <p>What do you all think?</p>
              <p>Any FEEDBACKS or SUGGESTIONS on this idea? Plus do you all think there will be any LIMITATIONS? I'll need all the help I can get.</p>
              <p>Thanks! :D</p>
              </div>

              <p>Do consider factors like if the bus stop "roof" are too low. :D</p>
              <p>You would like to consider as Ngweitong suggested, an water sensor, and also, interlocks with the buses' doors. You have to have some measures to ensure the shelters do not extend into the waiting passengers in the busstops, and cut-offs so that they do not extend if the buses open the doors whilst parked in a depot, or places with clearence problems</p>
              <p>Would the buses, for example, be able to run with this height added with the installation of this, if the services run on routes with height restrictions like low bridges?</p>
              <p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>Think about it, even if this shelter thing is implemented...</p>
              <p>How efficient would it be ? <br>- Additional time would now be needed because of the retracting of the shelters. <br>- Additional cost to the PTOs (end up whos going to pay for it?). <br>- Spending thousands of dollars to build a shelter on the bus (not forgetting the valuable time loss) just because ppl cant endure that 0.5sec of rain. Does it worth it ?</p>
              <p>Instead of spending so much money on this shelter thing, you might as well channel this money to upgrade the transport infrastructure ?</p>
