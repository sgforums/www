              <p>I am surprised that this matter has blown up and gone up in flames by the TS... I know it might be tough to tolerate such behaviour online, but I can't believe that it has gone to such an extent. Seeing all the insults just tells me that history is repeating itself again... (Thus, I am not surprised either.)</p>
              <p>I understand how such online behaviour may upset others, but it shouldn't go this far to cyber-bullying... Tbh, I had more trouble with those trying to sabotage this forum, though I had to tolerate much from Gohqianyan and Path Light (no offense).</p>
              <p>I second both AJQZC and jurongresident's posts. Instead of telling him off with such words, we should help him so that he can contribute greatly to this forum. I've been through bullying for a long time and it really hurts with the bullies calling you names and imitating you on purpose. Till this day, I get nasty remarks in school. It took me a long time to overcome this hurt and now I try to ignore them.</p>
              <p>I believe Gohqianyan and Path Light are not the same person. To me, it is obvious in their posts. I hope that this matter shall not be dealt to the extent that this forum becomes divided.</p>

              <p>Hi mr 23ispolo, I did offer him many counters that what he should or should not do when replying to his various topics without any offensive words (you can double check my posts). However he persisted with his ways. </p>
              <p>I believe all of us are actually kind-hearted by nature. Some may write in other ways as they are frustrated by continuous non-stop floodings. </p>
              <p>There is a limit to what all of us netizens can do. The people who should be responsible are his parents who need to monitor his online behaviour. Definitely not us. His parents must take into account what he is doing and how to react. What do you all think? Cheers. Thanks. </p>

              <p>I feel that Path Light/Gohqianyan832 (whether the same person or not) are just trolling in the forum intentionally despite countless advises from the users here. Just stop feeding the trolls and move on. If they genuinely didn't know certain facts and opinions of other users such as not suggesting the reinstatement of shortened bus services, suggesting the introduction of long-distance bus services or posting of common 2-bus bunching occurrences, they would have understood these instructions/rules the first time any user tells them to refrain from posting such stuff and not repeat them continuously.</p>
              <p>If SGF allows the banning of accounts, it would definitely be better to ban them.</p>

              <p>I am surprised that this matter has blown up and gone up in
              flames by the TS... I know it might be tough to tolerate such
              behaviour online, but I can't believe that it has gone to such an
              extent. Seeing all the insults just tells me that history is

              <p>I understand how such online behaviour may upset others, but it
              shouldn't go this far to cyber-bullying... Tbh, I had more trouble

              <p>I second both AJQZC and jurongresident's posts. Instead of
              telling him off with such words, we should help him so that he can
              contribute greatly to this forum. I've been through bullying for a
              long time and it really hurts with the bullies calling you names
              and imitating you on purpose. Till this day, I get nasty remarks in
              school. It took me a long time to overcome this hurt and now I try
              to ignore them.</p>
              <p>I believe Gohqianyan and Path Light are not the same person. To
              me, it is obvious in their posts. I hope that this matter shall not
              be dealt to the extent that this forum becomes divided.</p>

              <p>There is no need to be... I was just helping you as I try to prevent bullying here. But then again, please take note that I am also a user here, so I cannot stand it if you keep harping on the same topic again... While we may be stuck in the past where bus services were better, let's move on and see the future with new possibilities. 'Anticipate change and stay relevant'.</p>
