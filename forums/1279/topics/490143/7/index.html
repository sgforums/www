              <p>The gist is, most of the time we just want to discuss or find out about some details on routes, deployments, loading etc. It's meant to be a platform of communications of ideas and feedback. Not just for comments and suggestions.</p>
              <p>Besides, it's always better if you know someone who's familiar with some area (could be deployments, could be loading in certain towns, etc), and can ask for feasibility feedback from him before you actually submit your suggestion to LTA / MP, isn't it?</p>

              <p>Indeed, who doesn't <em>not</em> want to stay?</p>
              <p>But like I've said earlier, there is a problem right now, it's persisting for quite some time already, and it's affecting the way in which we can contribute useful posts.</p>
              <p>If the admins can't, or are unwilling to help, we'll have to take the matter in our own hands.</p>

              <p>It is already obvious from what I saw that it isn't just a simple case of spamming; but instead hurling of insults from both parties. I should have realised over the span of last five years when I was active, there have always been some spies trying to strike this area and targetting at more mature audiences...</p>
              <p>Facebook are meant for younger kids like them, regardless of whether they are autistic or not, but from what I know there are also a few others who are autistic in this community, yet they have never resorted to such actions on all three platforms of bus discussions. I would not be bothered with what occurred over there. However, <span style="line-height: 1.231;">this place are meant for more senior bus fans (I would use a real-life example of how different styles of Hokkien songs cater to different age groups of fans, where traditional ones cater to age groups of above 35-40 years and more popular ones cater to teenagers like 20 years of age, but there are also exceptions), it's fine if a few younger ones may want to simply come here and understand more, but lately things have been going out of control.</span></p>
              <p>I am extremely disgusted, not particularly on the spamming matter, but also like nonsensical creation of threads which nobody is interested in, and notwithstanding our interests, still continued to go on posting. I would rather this forum being kept to a certain group of people like the more experienced ones, those kids should have just stayed in their Facebook groups as they may have much more friends whom they have known in real life.</p>
              <p>For five years, I have experienced the ups and downs here, either being a person who have done wrong things in the past for a period of time, or witnessing how the forum is getting ruined by spams; sometimes the content or the rate of spams actually undermined our patience; at least the ones in 2012/2013 are even better than what I faced in 2014/2015. Spams on up to date content sounds much better than nonsensical and overdue stuff; and the motives behind are obvious; it is to just chase people out for revenge.</p>
              <p>If we can prevent the other party who sought to destroy the peace in these forums, I do not see why we cannot do it this time round; the moderator has his restrictions and limitations in an attempt to clear up this mess; and the administrators may not be active, but do not let them overtake your power. After all, we are going on well right here while the Facebook team are also leading a separate way (with a few members as 'righteous' spies). This is after all when we have different ideas, but we still have to respect each other in the first place.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
