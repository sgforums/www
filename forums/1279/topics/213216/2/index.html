From what i know , some B9TLs have ZF 6HP502 6-speed while others have Voith DIWA 864.3 4 speed .

I can't ever recall a bus that is so overloaded that the axles break and the tyres burst.  Furthermore, count the number of people in the bus, you will not get more than 20% overload.<br><br>Remember way back when TIBS first bought in the bendy bus, and Temasek Polytechnic tried to squeezed in as many people as possible?  It was on 3rd July 1998, and they managed to push 438 people into the box bendy bus (TIB 849 to TIB 904 series).<br><br>From what I know, the buses are designed based on a certain capacity, plus some overburden on ths bus.  The axles won;t break into 2.  Even harder for the tyres to burst, unless they have been weared down to a thin thread.<br><br>FYI, the rated laden weight of bus + fuel + 124 passengers + 1 driver is 23420Kg.

I know that if you put a torch on an axle , it can take you 15min to cut it. It is so tough, but that's for truck axle, bus one i dont know.

Only two axles are needed to support the back of the bus whereas 6 tyres are required to support the weight. Frankly speaking, i think a bendy bus is about 25% lighter than a DD. DDs are heavier because of the extra weight needed to prevent the bus from toppling over, whereas a bendy bus doesn't require this, but an experienced bus driver is recommended because backing up a bendy bus is lyk backing a semi-trailer, extremely tricky! I've seen one at Harbourfront for 963. The BC had to reverse the bus 3 times to align the bus properly and the trailer section keeps pushing into one direction! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

He does not need to go foward again if his bus bends if he uses this method. Just reverse slowly and make fine turning to change the direction of the back part of the bus.<br>Like that trailer truck drivers more experience because he can reverse his truck with trailer in a straight line and very far.<br></div>
