Not many such buses exist, because while they have very large capacities (larger than many bendy buses and definitely larger than any double-decker), however, they combine every disadvantage of both double-deckers and bendies (hog road space, height restrictions, etc.). Not only that, but thanks to their size, they usually need really large and powerful engines (read: noisy engines) and some kind of special systems on board to prevent all kinds of stability problems (both double-decks and bendies themselves already have centre-of-gravity and longitudinal stability problems, respectively). Most buses of this type are unsuccessful, and the model shown in the video, the Neoplan N138 JumboCrusier (actually a coach), had only 10 of it built (although an 11th similar model was also built).<br><br>Sources:<br>http://jumbocruiser.mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_bus</div>

If the driver drives the bus up a steep hill (i.e. 179), you will hear everything clearly. When the driver accelerates, you hear the engine growing louder, then you will hear the ZF gearbox start to whine. Then the engine volume will drop when it engages the lock-up, while the ZF whining pitch continues to increase, then both gearbox and engine will drop together when it shifts into 2nd gear! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by autumncs:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually many years ago Hong Kong considered ordering Neoplan JumboCrusiers because the population density in HK is very high and HK needs buses with high capacity to cope with the transportation of people. But the JumboCrusier has many problems (as indicated above) and Neoplan recommended the Megashuttle, a 15m 4-axle double-decker... (Neoplan even sent a Megashuttle to HK for trial run!) However, bus companies in HK found the 15m Megashuttle too long, and it was not suitable for the narrow HK streets (plus all the bends and sharp turns and steep slopes...)... In the end, the bus companies in HK ordered the 12m Centroliner from Neoplan. But now, bus companies realise that Neoplan Centroliners are not as reliable as the other models (such as Volvo Olympian and Dennis Trident). Centroliners tend to break down more often and they are more difficult to maintain... (After all, HK bus mechanics are used to British buses - Leyland, Volvo, Dennis, etc. To them, Neoplan is totally new and different.)<br><br>If you visit HK, you'll notice that most of the buses in HK are double-decker. (In fact HK has the highest number of air-con DD in the world. Haha.) Articulated buses are not used in HK because of the demanding road conditions... Also, the traffic jams in HK are terrible and articulated buses will make things worse as they occupy more road spaces. Singapore is lucky to have road conditions suitable for articulated buses (wider, straighter roads). In fact, some of my HK relatives are excited to see articulated buses here in Singapore, because they never see one in HK before! LOL...</div></blockquote>Get your Facts right.. It was due to the fact that the government had a law which prevents them to have Articulated buses in HK.</div>
