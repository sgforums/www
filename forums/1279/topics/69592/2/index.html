Circuit Link didn't exist until 1986, methinks. There was a road named Lor Bengkok which connected Circuit Rd to Paya Lebar Rd (but not anymore). Buses passing through MacPherson Estate didn't use this road. Instead, they entered and exited at Aljunied Rd via Merpati Rd and Mattar Rd respectively.

It went via Nicoll Highway, Mountbatten Rd, Fort Rd and ECP before exiting at Bedok South Ave 1. It didn't pass through Marina Centre in 1985 because there wasn't a Marina Centre in 1985. The route was amended to pass through Marina Centre in 1987.<br><br>In 1985, it didn't exit at Keppel Rd but at Prince Edward Rd. Why?

It was likely that the section between Nicoll Highway and Fort Rd was deleted and the route was amended via Raffles Blvd to get to the ECP. In this case, Marina Centre was the last stop before heading back to Bedok. Hence, the Bedok - Marina Centre desto.</div>
