Sv 107 have also quite a number of DD even though they don't use all together and sometimes uses SP buses. I also like their bus fleet as they are special like SBS 9657Y can make full sound which is very nice to hear. The bus won't be crowded during the non-peak hours and it would be totally empty sometimes which you could relax and enjoy the ride. The BC of Sv 107 drive the bus very fast but some drive really slow and the frequency waiting differ from 7(peak)-18(non-peak) mins and got one time I waited the bus for 25 mins which I was frustrated and want to fall alseep.</div>

'At least we got the guts...' What are you trying to prove?  Bus fans are rebellious?  Bus fans are unreasonable.  What will other ppl think of us?  You are tarnishing our reputation  Think before you reply next time.  It takes one rotten apple to make the other apples rotten.  It takes one small hole to sink a boat.<br><br>No one is stopping you from loving buses.  Only you yourself can.

Share it with us at here. For me I like SBS 9657Y the most as I frequently take this bus as I go out. It sometimes can go full sound, driving at a high speed, air-con full blast(but sometimes not cold). The bus that I hate is none for now as I like all the bus deployed on Sv 107</div>
