              <p>Have you feedback this to you MP? If not please go down to Blk 117 and find him on Monday evenings.</p>
              <p>That aside, why should 113 get DDs? Its a feeder service (don't talk about fare structure all those, look at the route and tell me who takes long distances, but wait, the route doesn't leave Hougang at all) and as with feeder services, people take short distances and are unlikely to move upstairs, after so many years (like 10 years) without a DD serving on 113/321. (you think people will be accustomed to a DD that quickly?).</p>
              <p>Adding more buses will be a better idea, assuming it helps with the frequency. Commuters are happier seeing buses come every 5 mins even if its a SD than 10 mins with a DD. Look at 238, 241 and 291, they come very quickly, sometimes the next bus is already behind at the interchange, and the fact 241 and 291 uses DDs shows that the demand for these two feeders are much more than 113.</p>
              <p>And a suggestion: Since 113 serves almost exclusively in Aljunied GRC (minus one stop in AMK GRC and one stop in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), why not ask PA take over since they like to take over things in Aljunied.</p>

              <p>Have you feedback this to you MP? If not please go down to Blk
              117 and find him on Monday evenings.</p>
              <p>That aside, why should 113 get DDs? Its a feeder service (don't
              talk about fare structure all those, look at the route and tell me
              who takes long distances, but wait, the route doesn't leave Hougang
              at all) and as with feeder services, people take short distances
              and are unlikely to move upstairs, after so many years (like 10
              years) without a DD serving on 113/321. (you think people will be
              accustomed to a DD that quickly?).</p>
              <p>Adding more buses will be a better idea, assuming it helps with
              the frequency. Commuters are happier seeing buses come every 5 mins
              even if its a SD than 10 mins with a DD. Look at 238, 241 and 291,
              they come very quickly, sometimes the next bus is already behind at
              the interchange, and the fact 241 and 291 uses DDs shows that the
              demand for these two feeders are much more than 113.</p>
              <p>And a suggestion: Since 113 serves almost exclusively in
              Aljunied GRC (minus one stop in AMK GRC and one stop in Pasir
              Ris-Punggol GRC), why not ask PA take over since they like to take
              over things in Aljunied.</p>
