              as the title says.
              -NOTICE-
              I am not trolling or whining,
              Service 113 has been packed for the past few years,
              if you guys know matthew bustrain busboy Or SBS5013G,
              ask him about the situation on svc 113.
              He's also a regular commuter of svc 113, same as me.
              
              Being the rep of residents in the 2 neighbourhoods of kovan,paya lebar and hougang,
              i would like to ask for assistance in the feedback of more buses/dds on 113, same like 163. 163 has gotten dds due to feedbacks through the senior management line,
              if anyone of you, could help, can you guys help to snap photos when 113 is packed, or help to feedback to SBS Transit, that service 113 has not been improved from 2004.
              
              if you think i'm talking crap or wasting bandwith, try taking 113 during the peak hours yourself, and reply back here.
              MORNING PEAK HOUR - bus still can tahan
              EVENING PEAK HOUR - FULL/Packed (bunching of 113/113A)
              
              Yours sincerely, 
              SBS5010P

                  13 Jan 2011     
                  
                      Dear Mr ,
                  Request for double decker bus to be deployed for service 113  
                    
                  We refer to your correspondence to us on the above, which we received via the Aljunied Town Council on 3 January, 2011.
                  
                  As conveyed by my colleague Lorelie in her reply to you, Service 113 is scheduled at an average headway of 12 minutes during the morning peak period, with 7 single decks in its fleet. Based on our checks conducted recently, the average capacity utilisation of this service is 31% between 0730hrs and 0800hrs, and 68% between 1745hrs and 1815 hrs.
                  
                  Hence, we regret we are unable to support your request.
                  
                  As a responsible public transport operator, we seek to keep our fares affordable, and hence, we seek your gracious understanding that we have to ensure that capacity is in tandem with demand. 
                  
                  That said, we wish to assure you we are monitoring this service closely, and that we will seek the co-operation of our on-board passengers to move to the rear of he bus to make more space for our other customers like yourself to board.
                  
                  We thank you for writing in to us to highlight this issue.
                  
                  
                  Yours sincerely

              <p>SBST already reply you that the capacity is more than enough.. They can collect all the passengers data. They jolly well know how many passengers are boarding Sv113... Dun understand why there are so many threads about Sv113 and WAB in HG/SK..</p>
              <p>like that, i also need to go to request WRIGHTS on Sv138/265/268/269.... go and see Sv268 buses during peak hours... should deploy Wrights. Go and see Sv269 buses that depart AMK Int from 6pm onwards till 11 pm... Need to request for Wrights as well.. Wait a minute, Sv265 also got lots of crowd coming from/going to Ave 10/ST 51.. Need Wrights as well...</p>
              <p>and Sv138 is also very crowded with frequency of 20 mins. Should not left the tourists squeeze in the buses and stand all the way to Zoo. must left good impression. PUT WRIGHTS on SV138......I demand SBST put Wrights on these services....</p>
