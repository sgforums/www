The other portions, like the 153, 107 berth to the 51, 151 berth and the alighting berths to the 74, 147 berths are new and are part of the NEL contract.

It applies to many eateries in Singapore. Look at Geylang, for example... of course don't think the other way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
