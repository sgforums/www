              <p><br>If you have been a bus captain for SBST long enough, you might know that there was a series of numerous bus accidents by SBS buses in the 1990s. The accidents happened very frequently, at least one per month, be it major or minor. I guess is this series of incidents that made SBS tuned up its bus fleet for safety reasons. That time they even engaged techinicians from Mercedes Benz, Scnia and Volvo to check on the condition of all the bus fleets. So that's probably one of the reason why SBS bus trips are slower since then.</p>
              <p>However I do agree SBST buses are slower generally, which means a longer schedule time for each trip. Advantage: Bus captains will drive at a speed that is safer, and on the other hand, they do not have to worry or stressed out when driving on tight schdules, and less fatigue and stress for them. Bus company can also ensure buses arrive on time for certain locations with better frequencies, as promised by the bus operator. Disadvantage: Buses may have to slow down due to ahead of schedules or drive very fast because of lag on schedule.</p>
              <p>Double_decker, as a staff of SBST, maybe you can feedback this to SBST in the public's point of view that bus trips are too slow for most commuters. To make bus commuting more attractive, you can suggest to them that the travel time for each trip can be cut by at first 5 mins for every trip and do a progressive time cuttings as time passes through trial and error. However this might not be easy as it involves a lot of re planning and maybe even might be at a disadvantage for bus captains. But for long run service improvements, I think it's worth the try.</p>
              <p>However this problem will be more prevalent in future due to 10 min frequency ruling, as timings have to followed tightly to prevent bunching. So most likely slower trips. If I am LTA, I would rather offer a 15 min time interval, a seamless guided bus system and at least 80% double decker fleet to cater the needs of commuters during peak hours. Longer frequency yes, but more punctual trips (using guided bus system), and comfortable trips (more seats avaliable for double deckers).</p>

              <p>somehow i gotta agree to this. because there's a 'risk' present along Dunearn Rd, but nowadays we seldom see that area jammed. Another place is Lornie Rd. Used to jam like crazy last time, nowadays not that much, so there's a chance 74 is faster than 74e.</p>
              <p>Last time, 74 in AM peak comfirm lambat, at least 5 to 10 minutes, worse case scenario can go up to 20+minutes. Nowadays, not wierd to see them early... Imo, the 74 runtime can be revised slightly... and that the ffw is allowed to change their route according to traffic conditions, but it seems like when PIE has a major jam, they still go accordingly... they should either make use of the service by Onemotoring and LTA to view the traffic cameras before deciding which route to go, or when the 1st bus encounter any jam, report back to the OCC...</p>
              <p>If PIE were to jam and Lornie Rd and Bukit Timah Rd are clear, they should just express that stretch of route...</p>
              <p>but on the light note, i still support the 74e route.. haha.. been collecting the tickets for the different regos.. still rmb the days of 1943Z, 1959D and 1965K, and now 2717D, 2721R and 2723K...</p>

              <p><br>198 also. I failed to miss SBS1941D (6.22am) slot. As my 'school bus' from Jurong East Avenue 1 to BNL. The BC tended to drive in a slow acceleration. However, it started to chiong after Boon Lay Avenue. At the end, it reached BNL at around 6.45am everyday. Normally, service 198 can reach BNL within (or less than) 18 minutes.</p>
              <p>It was before B9 was introduced on 198. Same thing goes to SBS7332Y too when it took over 6.22am's slot.</p>
              <p>But I think it has something to do with timings.</p>

              <p><br>Actually if u are talking about lorries and other buses overtaking it on the expressways, then i would say it's pretty normal. All buses are supposed to travel at not more than 60km/h on expressways. Those lorries and other buses might be speeding.</p>
              <p>Slow most likely means it's travelling at below 35km/h on normal roads, or the top gear not even reached for the whole journey.</p>
