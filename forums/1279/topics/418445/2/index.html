              <p>That is your own opinion.</p>
              <p>So haven't those who preferred SBST had enough of those flammings and childish insults of how lousy is SBS and the relentless trashing of their KUBs and their old buses, etc from those childish SMRT fan boys? Just a few recent posts and a thread is enough to show here. Does this "SBST copycat SMRT buying Citaros" sound familiar to you? Other than me, does these people also trying to take up all these nonsense? So you think that these flammings are just one sided?</p>
              <p>And how these SMRT fans maintain? One SMRT fan boy can even go to the extremes to create a thread that openly post up names and disgrace a few bus fans here and spammings countless accounts and countless threads and posts just to pull people over to the other forum just because these people don't agree with him and he cannot accept their criticisms. So who is worse? Is this an acceptable behaviour here?</p>
              <p>And stop labeling me a Anti-SMRT fan or Pro-SBS fan. I dislike SMRT doesn't mean that I like SBST and pro SBS. I just preferred the way that they are maintaining their service standards much better but that doesn't mean that I think that they are the best. I have many to say as I know people who know people working in both companies but I am not saying more here because all these are company business and not supposed to be openly discussed here.</p>
              <p>You all want to create that kind of labeling, dividing, discriminating and dividing, then that is your way how your group behaves. Don't drag me into the picture. I just post my opinions here, take it or leave it. You all want to divide among yourselves, be it, senior vs junior, AMK Depot vs SL Depot, Professional photographers vs newbies, Pro SBS and Pro SMRT, etc, then you all go ahead. I don't belong to any group and neither am I joining any. You all want to quarrel and divide among all these things then go ahead, don't drag me in. I had talked to some of the more experienced bus fans in person and online and they are already so damn fed up and upset about all these quarrels and dividings here. There is even a very good person who was so upset, based on what I have seen on his online posts, that it is badly affecting him.</p>
              <p>So you all want to create that kind of divide, quarrel, fight, split up, hurling childish posts and insults, then you all continue. I am just posting my opinions here in the forum, on what I agree and observed, and that's all.</p>

              <p>So be it,I never post also got flame war.Its fine if you dislike certain company but to a limit.Neverless i aint pro smrt nor anti sbst.Its just i dun feel right someone criticise so badly and openly in bus forum somemore.Then what about true blue SMRT bus fan?Cant they post anything fearing of someone will start a flame war needlessly?If this Vicamour dislike SMRT i could understand but not to the extend of his post saying the company should close shop and concentrate on rail business instead.That's beyond our control man,LTA got good judgement.For eons i see the double standards here left untouched.Wanna criticise then do both companies as both got weakness and strength.If the mods here think i'm the troublemaker here just by hearing one side story then ban me,I dun give a hoot about it.</p>

              <p>So haven't those who preferred SBST had enough of those

              relentless trashing of their KUBs and their old buses, etc from
              those childish SMRT fan boys? Just a few recent posts and a thread
              is enough to show here. Does this "SBST copycat SMRT buying
              Citaros" sound familiar to you? Other than me, does these people
              also trying to take up all these nonsense? So you think that these
              flammings are just one sided?</p>
              <p>And how these SMRT fans maintain? One SMRT fan boy can even
              go to the extremes to create a thread that openly post up names and
              disgrace a few bus fans here and spammings countless accounts and
              countless threads and posts just to pull people over to the other
              forum just because these people don't agree with him and he cannot
              accept their criticisms. So who is worse? Is this an acceptable
              behaviour here?</p>
              <p>And stop labeling me a Anti-SMRT fan or Pro-SBS fan. I dislike
              SMRT doesn't mean that I like SBST and pro SBS. I just
              preferred the way that they are maintaining their service standards
              much better but that doesn't mean that I think that they are the

              <p>Well you know what? You're just wasting your time coming here to post all these things. So what if you don't like SMRT? That's your loss. Not ours. No one is going to force you to like SMRT. Yeah, each company have their pros and cons. You like it or not, just live with it. Yeah, SBST SLBP buses are not well maintained and SBST AMDEP/BRBP is so what? SLBP has it share of good buses (referring to the Sunlongs and probably some other types) and BRBP/AMDEP does too.  You like or not also, you have to live with them. No matter what, you still have to commute on them, eventually. Even SMRT also face this kind of problems. We can just go and give feedbacks to the relevant companies and just hope that they'll do something. It's way better than just sitting and criticizing on the computer.</p>
              <p>SBST copycat SMRT by buying citaros? So what? Look at the MB O405, different chassis but different bodywork. SBST has WA/DM and SMRT has Hipsano. Just hope that you know, it would be different. If it's the same also, you eventually have to get used to it. </p>
              <p>Then see the KUB, 1100, don't you think it's too much? They've could just gotten SD buses from different brand. Probably about 400 Scanias, 400 Mercedes Benz and 300 Volvos? At least bring in variety of buses into our roads instead of "massage chair buses". SMRT, eventhough it's not buying alot of buses now, at least it's putting demostrators on the roads, much more better than 1100 Scanias. Think about it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There may be divided loyalties here, but let it be. You can do your part by shining away from the crowd and be that "different one". It's no fun going by the books all the time, you gotta shine out somehow. At least you're being original, not some poser. Let them argue all they want, we can try to stop them. But the end of the day, they are just bringing down their name, not yours. <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>So, you have nothing to worry about. Let there be 2 forums. At least we know that SGF is the original one. Not the other one. It's simple, not happy. Just leave. No point staying and making people like you when they don't. I may sound harsh here but i hope you get my point, somehow. </p>
              <p>I understand that you hate being labelled, but who does? Let them label you all they want. See how long can it go. I can assure you it won't be long enough before they are being labelled themselves. </p>
              <p>And whoever the person who just wants bendie buses to be banned in Singapore, just think as though you're banning Double Deck buses in Singapore. In fact, those bendies and double decks distinguish the both companies, by showing what that particular company has to offer to the public. Those buses are already trying their best to get people moving. It's better than having rigid single deck buses fighting for its life especially during peak hours. People want to get from Point A to Point B and back to Point A efficiently, unless of course they have all the time in the world to waste time and wait and wait and wait and eventually rot at the bus stop. </p>

              <p>Seriously for this point, most of you people still don't get it. What is there to distinguish? If bendy buses are not suited for our roads, then so be it. Look for an alternative that is more viable in the long term. I don't need a double decker to tell me that it is SBST and a bendy bus to tell me it is SMRT. This is plain ridiculars.</p>
              <p>Just look at the situation now, they are many complains about bendy buses, taking up space, road hogging, etc. And they are taking up so much space in bus interchanges and depots. Looking the design of our bus stops, bus bays are narrow and short, bus shelters are mostly have a limited size. And the future design of new bus interchanges, they are getting smaller in area. Such long buses aren't ideal for our busy roads, then what for having so much of them on the roads and jam up and create long queues which LTA disliked in this aspect on buses? In the end, it is like making buses disadvantaged at this point of view with such problems.Then how, LTA support more MRTs and then cut down on buses because of this? Sorry but I don't want a situation like this in future.</p>
              <p>If Hong Kong bus companies can together buy double deckers, even using the same brand and bodyworks, then why does Singapore bus companies have to divide and distinguish using different models and in the end, limit themselves with certain choices only and let commuters squeeze and squeeze in more single deckers? This kind of dumb negative competition just make commuters suffer.</p>
              <p>If LTA is limiting or banning bendy buses, then SMRT choose double deckers. No one says that SBST can only exclusively get double deckers. In the end, SMRT services can at least accomodate more passengers with more double deckers, instead of having capacity problems with limited number of bendies. And please to SBST, get more double deckers, a lot of commuters are unhappy with all the WAB single deckers with lesser seats.</p>

              <p><br>I do think that there is too much for 1100 but what can you do? LTA did a very bad timing on the purchasing of WAB buses, which results in SBST being desperate in need for new fleet of WAB buses, because they have so many old buses on hand that needs to be replaced asap due to rulings and rulings and rulings. The pricing offered was right then and the dire of need was already there, won't the fleet purchaser got other choices?</p>
              <p>At least SBST did a lot to improve these buses, batch by batch, more seats, quieter engines, less vibration, EEV versions are so much better than the EURO IV versions.  And they are also improving the quality of the EURO IVs after complains and feedbacks. What more do you want? I don't really like the EURO IVs anyway, and I hope SBST can replace them after 12 years.</p>
              <p>Complain some more, then why not you join SBST as the fleet purchaser, and then help and replace all the KUBs instead?</p>

              <p>comparing the size of the two companies you will realise that the diseconomies of scale are far greater for SBST than SMRT. that is simply why SMRT can afford to buy small amounts of each bus type or be more ambitious in trying out demonstrators. whereas for SBST it would be far more economically viable to purchase a large fleet otherwise they would not be making a financially sound decision. </p>
              <p>i am sure that both SBST and SMRT would have made detailed evaluation into the different makes that were offered to them before committing into a purchase. as profit making entities, bottom line is of far more importance to them. i have said this before, if bus X and bus Y (assuming both are comparable European makes for instance) can fulfil the same primary objective ie. fetching passengers from point A to point B, but if bus X is far cheaper or if the price between both manufacturers are similar, but Y's dealership offers a far better aftersales package, which would I choose?</p>
              <p>fleet planners are not driven by their whims and fancy, they are driven by dollars and sense. so how can you say that SMRT putting out demos are far better than SBST? SBST did put out its fair share of demos back in 2008 as well, in case you forget. basically your whole comparison is between apples and oranges.</p>
