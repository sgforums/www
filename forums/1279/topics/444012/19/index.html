              <p>I think sv92 might not be able to use citaros due to the steep

              recently a kub running on it and it runs around holland v
              area..perhaps possible. Sv93 could do with citaros too and AR could
              use some of its striders n dm3500s on other AR services. Same for

              <p>Agree. Another example of this would be sv33 on BN side. I dont know whether is it a packed service along its route during peak but seems like BN is moving its striders and some kubs to other services or spare. I think it could cope during non-peak even in areas like victoria st etc. Sv 354 using citaros may be a good idea but BN only saves 2 Kubs..lets say full fleet citaro.</p>
              <p>Btw do you know the missing bus on sv32 for BN side? I saw 2626H once and ytd 2791M on it.  Also sv40 seems to use 922R ytd and 881A today. 881A might be spare soon. Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>33's fleet is sometimes quite packed during peak hour cause there's Chinatown &amp; Bugis. Crush loading usually happens there from what I can see (esp Bugis, almost 7 days a week always packed). Think 33's fleet is due to mileage and lesser extent to capacity though, the 4 perm Citaros now aren't gonna increase capacity much anyway.<br><br>42's fleet like unstable seh. Everyday different buses as far as I can tell from the cameo posts of everyone.</p>
              <p>Anyway, 354 at most only 1 Citaro now. The other slot just done by random KUBs, don't know where 8419A MIA to. Not even on cameo that guy.</p>
              <p>Think BNDEP is like playing mahjong now, trying to figure out which Mk4/KUB to kope out from the diff services. Just look at how they kick 922R 937Z 8332R 8335H 8416H 8532E out of their perm service and you get what I mean.</p>

                  from what I can see (esp Bugis, almost 7 days a week always
                  packed). Think 33's fleet is due to mileage and lesser extent to
                  capacity though, the 4 perm Citaros now aren't gonna increase
                  capacity much anyway.<br> <br> 42's fleet like unstable seh. Everyday different buses as far as I
                  can tell from the cameo posts of everyone.</p>
              <p>Anyway, 354 at most only 1 Citaro now. The other slot just done
                  by random KUBs, don't know where 8419A MIA to. Not even on cameo
                  that guy.</p>
              <p>Think BNDEP is like playing mahjong now, trying to figure out
                  which Mk4/KUB to kope out from the diff services. Just look at how
                  they kick 922R 937Z 8332R 8335H 8416H 8532E out of their perm
                  service and you get what I mean.</p>

              <p>That should be the only problem for BN and it needs more wrights for services like sv5 etc. Unlike HG, it almost has enough citaros to replace its MK III fleet and giving wrights and citaros and turning striders and batch 1/2 VOs to spare or other services.</p>
              <p>Sv42 hasnt found a bus that suits it I guess. The last mk III to cameo on it was 778R. Likely a DM. Will try to observe it for the next few months. It's a good thing AM gave back some DMs back to BN. That bus is still good with punching noise from its transmission. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>About what time of the day do you see 5006C on sv36? I do know I
              saw it once at ard 4 plus at suntec area. I'll try to observe it
              cause its around where I'm normally at. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>It would be better for 5006C to perm sv36 cause it has more
              seats in front. Dont know why the euro Ivs have so many areas
              bounded by poles in front. Not too good if 8169X is going to be
              perm sv36..cant utilize much of the space for the suntec crowd in
              the evening.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>I see 5006C usually on Fridays and over the weekend that stretch though. That's why I can't confirm if it's perm or sth, but it's good if you could help me check cause both 5006C &amp; 8169X have been MIA in cameoing lately to me.<br><br>But yeah, I also think the Euro V would be a better bet too cause of the more lethargic / slower-accelerating gearbox (depends on how you see it) compared to the Euro IV. I mean, that is one of the reasons why 36 gave away 8306S 8326J 8327G 8330X that bunch to their respective perm services now cause the Euro IV tended to be less smooth at the limit on the expressway sector from CGA to Marine Parade (vice versa).</p>

              <p>Yeah that's true. I mean like even the few BRBP SP Striders they have, more often than not I see them cameo on Sv 60 more times in a month than they did on other services. <br><br>Perhaps a lack of new Wrights + Citaros (this one is substantial, the last batch of new Citaros AM/BR got was 6077R 6081C that bunch, exception of that 6109H which came from Training), while they continued to register and allocate another 100+ more Citaros till the 618x series now already.</p>
