              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Actually this does not happn for the first time. I did remember
              in March when SBS8503P has been missing from Svc 54 for 2 to 3
              months and random KUBs (mostly Euro V) are replacing its shift. The
              first week when this bus is is missing it's always SBS5100M which
              is replacing its time slot, and I almost thought it's perm 54.
              After which, random AMDEP SP buses such as SBS8832P and sometimes
              other perm 54 KUBs constantly replaces its shift everyday till the
              day when SBS8503P returned.</p>
              <p>I guess this may apply to SBS8538P, whereby for this case
              SBS8483M replaces SBS8538P's shift and random KUBs keep on
              replacing SBS8483M's shift. The replacement KUB is usually a Euro V
              bus rather than a Euro IV bus and this may last for quite some time
              but not too long, hopefully SBS8538P will be back in 2 or 3 months
              time, if that is what I predicted happened.</p>

              <p>I see I see. I've no idea why would they switch another Euro IV KUB on Sv 53 for 8538P though, the only reason would have been mileage. </p>
