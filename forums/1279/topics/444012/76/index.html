              <p>Give this bus some time ba. Just recently took this bus and is still sounds ok. Because the a/c vents are the old type, cant expect the vents can turn any way like the eye ball ones. Therefore it seems not cold.</p>
              <p>Slowly most of the sv159 strider buses are going for repainting and some cosmetic touch up. 2608K just came back with a fresh new paint and red ducts. This bus is still on sv159 today. Impossible to be de-reg with any offical news.</p>

              <p>Woah damn. I always thought 3131L was a fleet add. Cause when it came in, IIRC 8205A was still stuck on Sv 12, though like you said some permers swapped timings. Plus 8205A went to Sv 39 only after the timetable revision for Sv 39, which is about a month+ after 3131L came in.</p>
              <p>So the period in between after 3131L came in, I don't think 8205A did much cameoing though other than on Sv 12. Weird. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Just to check again, the fleet add for 538's 2nd trip, the fleet add is one of the 2 Batch 1s? (9345Y / 9317D)?</p>

              <p>Anyway, not sure if anyone has noticed in the latest SBST release, there was a line near the bottom, that said the bus services improved under the quarter of Oct - Dec 2012 (not BSEP). In it, there was Sv 19..which leads me to this:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suspect:</span><br><strong>SBS3167J</strong><br>(BN SP) - (BN 19)<br><br>I'm suspecting this because for the past 2 weeks+, for weekdays, if 3167J is in Tampines, it's usually on Sv 19 at least for Peak. And the weird thing is, 3015P is also on Sv 19 on the same days. That means there's 2 Wright slots on Sv 19 for weekdays for the past 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>I tried to find any DDs missing, but none are consistently missing though. Ditto for KUBs. So Sv 19 might have gotten a fleet add, with 3167J going in. I will observe more again to confirm. </p>

              <p>Woah damn. I always thought 3131L was a fleet add. Cause when it
              came in, IIRC 8205A was still stuck on Sv 12, though like you said
              some permers swapped timings. Plus 8205A went to Sv 39 only after
              the timetable revision for Sv 39, which is about a month+ after
              3131L came in.</p>
              <p>So the period in between after 3131L came in, I don't think
              8205A did much cameoing though other than on Sv 12.
              Weird. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>Just to check again, the fleet add for 538's 2nd trip, the fleet
              add is one of the 2 Batch 1s? (9345Y / 9317D)?</p>

              <p>8205 was running around bedok and tampines route group services while spare. i go to the east less often now but i still see that bus running around on routes that go to where i go.</p>
              <p>yes the fleet add was when 9317 9345 came in... that one dates back many months ago. also round the time 7433 replaced some other non-WAB bus.</p>
