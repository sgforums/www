              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, going by what you say, the same goes for Sbs
              transit, smrt, Go Ahead Singapore. They did nothing to maintain the
              required frequency for their bus services due to the massive jam
              along TPE experienced in the evenings during weekdays, causing
              their frequency to derail from the stated frequencies. </p>
              <p>So LTA, please do not award all packages to Sbs transit, smrt
              and go ahead Singapore. </p>
              <p>Crazy right? What sort of reasoning is this to say the traffic
              conditions cannot count in?</p>
              <p>What about Go Ahead Singapore service 386 which also keeps
              underperforming even after several complaints? 386 is also caused
              by traffic jams around Punggol area (particularly Punggol field
              stretch). Even 3/83 also affected due to the need to pass by the
              Punggol field stretch leading to the other exit along Punggol field
              to TPE/KPE. So why isn’t Go Ahead Singapore being
              penalized? </p>
              <p>Morale of the story is to give and take sometimes. No need to be
              so insistent on fault of company.</p>

              <p>You damn sure they didn't? When I took svc 3 most of its buses were on time even during peak. Definitely not as bad as most of SBST's svcs, leave alone the disaster on 24. </p>
              <p>GAS is one of the better ones out there alr in terms of maintaining stable freq. I will concede the 386 scenario if it is true but when you come down here at Changi, svc 2 never deviates too far from a freq of max 15 mins. </p>
              <p>If anything, you should check out the vast difference in svcs like 15 and 34 after GAS took over from SBST. SBST used to UNDEROPERATE 15 stretching its freq to 20 mins on Saturdays, despite it being a much needed connection for many residents in Joo Chiat and Tamp west. 34 used to be a bloody bunching svc, now GAS has improved it, though not by very much uh I'll admit </p>
              <p>Sure enough, I can cut some slack on SBST, maybe they did try to improve the timings with fleet adds on many svcs. But what's the use if they continue to stretch out the freq? Worse still, LTA knowing that timings can be so messed up, couldn't be bothered to help out with the troubled SBST? Maybe adjust the timetable timings, esp with the intro of DDU? Or allow SBST more autonomy over the deployment?</p>

              <p>Indirectly its run by LTA hahaha...Operator propose LTA approves..But again i prefer either a French or German operator over Aussie Tower Transit.UK Go-Ahead seem improved despite the svc 386 saga.They did trial B9TL at edgefield/edgedale plains but the narrow u turn is just too risky.Peak hour jams add more salt to the wound.I personally have drive 386 couple of times.</p>

              <p>The fundamental problem lies with the route design. They used to
              be designed for maximum catchment at the expense of traveller's
              time but this does not meet the needs of travellers who are
              increasingly time poor.</p>
              <p>In such cases, a mere change of operator does not solve the
              problem.</p>
              <p>New limited stop services 12e and 147e is a good start, but a
              revamp of the entire route network is sorely needed. The planners
              know how to create decent express rail replacement routes, but
              something seems to be holding them back from extending it beyond
              MRT/LRT replacement periods.</p>
