Just like the bus drivers are told to purposely slow down by the operators if there is a similar bus service no in front just to maintain headway. In the end, the bus behind purposely travels so slow intentionally and for the next few minutes, there are no passengers waiting to board it as well. A big farcical wayang without any objectives. Wayang for the sake of wayang. Only disadvantage is people on board gets delayed for another few minutes to destinations. Cheers. Thanks.</p>
                                                                                        </div>

                                                                          <p>BCM is about getting the best people to manage bus services.</p> 
                                      
                                      <p>In future, buses may become driverless, but we still need people to maintain the equipment and communicate with customers.</p>
                                  
                                  <p>More importantly, we need BCM to match our bus services at market rate, so that it is comparable to other cities like London, New York and Australia.</p>
                                                                          <p>We need competition to ensure that we always get the best quality products and services.</p>
                                                                        <p>From the customer perspective, this may not seem much because everything is business as usual, and nothing much changes except for the visuals and addition of new bus services.</p>
                                                                          <p>But for Singapore to continue to have frequent and reliable public transport, competition is key. For buses, we have BCM. For trains, we have NRFF (New Rail Financing Framework). All these is to ensure that Singapore continues to have good quality public transport and that the economy continues to thrive forever and ever.</p>

                      <p>On the administrative side, the solution is to re-register the paperwork, from the incumbents to LTA.</p>
                      <p>Though complicated, itâ€™s only a one-off process, which should not restrict the BCM contracts of concern to the incumbents whose cross boarder bus routes are in there.</p>
                      <p>Anyway, if the paperwork is going to take a long time, the Bukit Merah package would not be the first negotiated contract to be tendered out, but instead implemented only a few years later to allow time for the paperwork to be done.</p>
                      <p>But since the Bukit Merah bus package can commence this year, I would assume that the paperwork should be done by then, if not already done.</p>
                      <p>So, no, I donâ€™t think there is a need for the cross boarder bus routes to remain with the incumbent.</p>

              <p>BCM system works best in major cities with a high population density, most notably capital cities. Technically, it could be implemented without too much difficulty in the Klang Valley.</p>
              <p>London and Perth have a long history of BCM being practised. The authorities there were smarter as they realised that allowing individual operators legal ownership of the means of production wasn't sustainable in the long run. As we have seen, IntraKota and Cityliner in Kuala Lumpur were having severe financial woes and had to seek government intervention, which prompted the restructuring of the whole public transit network in the Klang Valley.</p>
              <p>That being said, having a monopoly operator breeds complacency in the long run, and here is where competitive tendering comes in. Ideally, no single contractor should control more than 50% of the market, because they don't deserve to. Transperth's "50% of total service mileage" rule exists for a good reason. </p>
              <p>On that note, SBST having bagged Seletar and Bukit Merah should therefore be ruled ineligible to defend Hougang.</p>

              from getting the remaining 1 contract. This was what happened in
              2000, when SMRT was barred from getting the North East Line as the

              <p>I know that you're pro-SBST but again Bt Merah concern is the two cross-border SVC and nothing else.Seletar is because of the lowest price they've spoilt the market.I don't see SBST has the quality over others it's just that they are the senior here and they run bus business longer than the others.TTS and GAS training school is more quality based then them.</p>
