              <p>The fact that SBST is UNDEROPERATING the service (And many
              others I daresay) proves that it as an operator lacks the adequate
              qualities required to provide services for the residents under the
              package for the next 5 years. </p>
              <p>The fact that it knows that the government backs it up, given
              its huge stakes in CDG under TH, makes it complacent and
              comfortable in its own position, therefore is indifferent to the
              problem and can't be any less bothered to do something about
              it.</p>

              <p>I am sorry to read about SMB128Bâ€™s encounter with bus service 24. I feel that it would be better if SMB128B forward the feedback to LTA as not everyone in this forum takes bus service 24 and is able to help SMB128B with his concern about bus service 24.</p>
              <p>If thereâ€™s any misunderstanding, may I apologize. I was just trying to help my fellow forum participant get his message across to the relevant authority, so that appropriate measures can be taken to address the issue.</p>

              <p>Just address me as I am and there is no need to coward your responses. </p>
              <p>"Where traffic tends to be uncertain" is not an excuse for prolonged and REPEATED delays in the journey. When the problem becomes long term it becomes a normality and it is then the operator's or LTA's responsibility to remedy the problem. Either they adjust the DDU timings, to tighten timings at jam free areas and loosen timings at jammed areas, or they pump in downroutes past jammed areas. If need be, LTA may intervene in trimming, splitting, or converting these often outdated trunk routes to increase reliability.</p>
              <p>I think it is people like you in the administration that are leading to such a lack in efficacy to solve the problem. If you only observe all timings from the interchange of bloody course all the buses will be on time la! So buses only travel from one interchange to another? Everyone only takes the bus to and from the end points? Your choice to shove the problem aside just reflects the irresponsible and nonchalant attitude some people have in the office, hence I need not even justify myself that such a "phenomenon" actually exists. </p>
              <p>I think you are completely right that we must be objective. I hereby present to you not my own emotions, but my experiences as a typical commuter. I also do find fault with other operators. However, I think it's only fair I bring the 24 issue to the table right now (when this problem actually existed since ages ago) given the winning of the bid by SBST, and the fact that DESPITE PROMISES BY THE CONTRACT SBST still failed to deliver, shows not only how undeserving SBST is of Seletar, but also how full of shit LTA is in all its "rules" on the  winning operator. Selective enforcement?</p>

              <p>Hi mr SMB128B, going by what you say, the same goes for Sbs transit, smrt, Go Ahead Singapore. They did nothing to maintain the required frequency for their bus services due to the massive jam along TPE experienced in the evenings during weekdays, causing their frequency to derail from the stated frequencies. </p>
              <p>So LTA, please do not award all packages to Sbs transit, smrt and go ahead Singapore. </p>
              <p>Crazy right? What sort of reasoning is this to say the traffic conditions cannot count in?</p>
              <p>What about Go Ahead Singapore service 386 which also keeps underperforming even after several complaints? 386 is also caused by traffic jams around Punggol area (particularly Punggol field stretch). Even 3/83 also affected due to the need to pass by the Punggol field stretch leading to the other exit along Punggol field to TPE/KPE. So why isn’t Go Ahead Singapore being penalized? </p>
              <p>Morale of the story is to give and take sometimes. No need to be so insistent on fault of company.</p>
              <p>Cheers. Thanks.</p>
