              <p>Was expecting 851e to pop up anytime soon, kinda expected it tbh given how 851 was the most probable candidate to to have a limitied stop variant.</p>
              <p>I don't think 851's loading will take a huge dip as it is well utilized between Bukit Merah and Chinatown and also between Bishan and CBD where 851e will not cover. However, I still think 851e is a good move as it can compensate for the lack of high-capacity buses on 851 since post-transition to SBST...</p>

              <p>I agree. Temasek will not let SMRT Buses fail. Buses is the one

              Shouldn't be an issue for SMRT to retain the current 3 packages, as
              well as going on to win 1 or 2 more. Majority would still most

              <p>A large portion of 851's demand is due to pax transferring to CCL via marymount mrt. During AM peak, fully packed A22s towards BM are only fully seated (or with a few standees) after mrm mrt bus stop.</p>
              <p>Most people travelling from yis to the city rather take mrt/850E/857 as those are definitely faster. 851e could be aimed that relieving the load of those (esp NSL) rather than mainly 851 itself</p>
