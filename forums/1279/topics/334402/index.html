              <p>Well... such incident also happened on me once.</p>
              <p>After hearing the news that SMRT was employing a few hundred Chinese nationals to spruce up the bus frequencies,  I was relieved and at the same time worried. Relieved that we might not need to wait for sun to set before the next bus arrives. Worried that they might be reckless or inattentive. However, I chose to ignore the latter, hoping that they would change our conventional mindset about them once they arrive to Singapore to undergo a strict yet extensive and holistic training.</p>
              <p>Boy.. I was so wrong about that ....</p>
              <p>I was at the bus-stop opp Jurong East regional library when I saw Service 178, driven by a Chinese national, approaching. Curious to see how the Chinese driver conducts himself, I boarded the bus (as the bus also goes to my destination) and realized that the bus-driver was talking non-stop to his friend sitting right behind him, in an undeniable 'China' accent. As a result, although I pressed the bell early enough for him to stop the bus in time, he continued his bus journey and stopped only when he saw some people flagging for the bus.</p>
              <p>I was flabbergasted and considering that it's my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first time </span>boarding a bus driven by a Chinese national, that's certainly not a good impression he has left on me. Luckily, although he stopped 2 bus-stops ahead of my original alighting stop, the distance wasn't too far and I managed to walk back. It's a pity that I didn't take note of the bus number plate 'cos at that moment, I was overwhelmed with shock. Such an incident has never happened on me before and my first encounter with a Chinese driver turns out to be a nightmare already.....</p>
              <p>I guess all passengers, including myself, who had their alighting stops skipped, would raise doubts about their effectiveness and efficiency. Hence, I feel it's important that the main operators (SMRT and SBST) strike a balance between securing a sizeable manpower to improve its bus frequency and maintaining its quality of service. Looks like both operators have stg to work on to gain back the public's confidence by leaps and bounds.</p>

              <p>I don't know why.
