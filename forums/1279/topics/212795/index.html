But i do have some opposite views. If an elderly board the bus, i will automatically give up my seat. Even if i'm tired (Yawn).<br><br>But if the bus brake hard, the elderly will lose their balance then fall and injure themselves. I'm pretty much concerned with this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing to do with money, age or whatever. Its just if u are polite enough to give ur seat to elderly, if u dont, you jolly well do NOT expect other people to give u a seat when u are in ur 60's and 70's. Coz u didnt give others one when u are young and abled body.</div>

I see some schools student glued to the GREEN seats somemore. Somemore from BETTER schools than me (don't guess which school I am from <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). Most easily seen on a service which turn and turn and turn in the Tampines area before reaching the int. They always think that there is ghost at the back of the bus and there is gold near the exit door too.<br><br>No offence to anyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
