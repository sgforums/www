I think these groups of ppl deserve to sit on the green seats. However, hao xin bu yi ding hui you hao bao. This can be illustrated with the quote below.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jaydunkfull:</div><div class="quote_body">i didnt know the green seats were for the elderly...but what about those sbs bus where the seats are black with some colored stripes on them. there arent any seats that are supposedly for the elderly are there?<br>and another thing. actually things are not as they look like. even though we often see students or adults sitting while there are old folks standing, it doesnt mean that the former is selfish or inconsiderate. ive encountered many situations where i did give up my seat to the old folk standing but he/she refused and told me to sit down while they choose to continue standing. ive seen quite a number of old folks rejecting seats from others who offer as well. so what the public see is the old folks standing while the young is sitting but how many know the actual story? see, we're always jumping to conclusions. so whenever i encounter such awkwardness where i know there must be people commenting on how selfish i am, not giving up my seat, when i had and was rejected, i just tell myself that at least the person up there knows what is going on and so i shouldnt worry to much since i know that is what is should do. the feeling's not good though.</div></blockquote>There is one day when I was boarding bus 960 to woodlands from Bugis. I saw a man with walking stick boarding the bus which is quite packed with ppl. Out of compassion together with my courage, I give up my seat and use hand signals to indicate that the seat is specially for him. However, he said no need and told me to sit down. In the end, some other guy took the seat. The feeling is rather wierd and not gd though. Perhaps Singapore still do not have the culture of giving up seats to people and thus the "wierd" feeling in me arises. Pardon me for saying that. Although I know that many ppl are actually kind and compassionate and courageous enough to give up the seats, the social stigma attached to these actions are there.</div>

Some elderly are still headstrong at their age ( mostly because of their dignity), so you cant do anything much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe some old folks really don't deserve to be given a seat. Here are a few examples I have encountered:<br><br>- Old woman, nothing to carry: (translated from Hokkien) "Boy ah... The seat hot-hot one why you give me sit..? You want me to die is it..?" But she still sat down. I dropped and took an alternative bus service at the next stop.<br><br>- This is physical. Me and a few friends were queuing for a bus at a major neighourhood interchange between central Singapore and the north when 2 old ladies shoved, i repeat, shoved my friend out of the queue and stood in line. The other passengers just watched on. We were in school uniform so we didn't kick up a fuss.<br><br>- MRT. City Hall. Old man, well-dressed, Rolex or Rolek i dunno but he just barged into the train before passengers could even get out of their seats to alight. Was behind him with 20-odd other passengers.<br><br>So sometimes old folks have rights but they abuse them. I still give up my seat but I see their actions from the time they board first.</div>
