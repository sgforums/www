              <p>But hey let's given them some credit for SEA's first Euro V bus.</p>
              <p>And btw, replacing these buses needs time. They will definitely be replaced as time goes by. UDs are going. So you can strike that off your list. Be patient and see what SMRT will be doing, since they have plans to bring in more buses.</p>
              <p>Before you blame SMRT, you have to blame TIBS for buying those buses.</p>

              <p><br>Dennis Lance is still alright but it depends on how the technician handle or maintain the condition of the buses as some of the UK Dennis Lance cannot make it(eg the axle create lots of noises when passing through of humps, breaking and many more). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><br><br>But try taking TIB1008E(took it on Sv 985, the axle did not make any noise and the acceleration and speeding was smooth), I think it is the best among the UK fleet for now (not sure for TIB1002X as the last time I took it was good also)<br><br>For MY side, it also depend on the technician and how the BCs operate those buses <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Seriously, i hope you do give them a chance please. What you (you shld know yourself) just did is like stangling a choking person to death. At least they are doing smth right? Its much better than letting their bus continue to rot.</p>
              <p>At least now they have refurbished their buses, with new seats and interior parts replacement. Now the OC500LE (or O500LE) is coming up. At least i feel much better than last time. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p> It was LTA who forced SMRT with all this drastic changes. Imagine if the rules were still relax as before, do you think SMRT would have make this changes? With the new rules in place, SMRT's position is vulnerable now. They know that if they don't do anything, their control of the buses will be in jeopardy now that the goverment allows the 3rd bus company to join in the monopoly.</p>

              <p>Even with the new rules, it doesnt state that the new buses must be Euro V or from Mercedes Benz. Hence why did SMRT buy MB buses in the end? I'm not sure about SBST tho, but i knew that SMRT did a survey with their SLs about what bus brand is their ideal bus brand. MB got the win.<br><br>Anw, my answer would be 2 &amp; 3 <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>
