            <div class='col-md body'>I love my town. Its at the west of the west. No other town is to the west of it. For over 15 years, I've watched it grew from a small corner in the middle of nowhere into a bustling and hectic town of today. Most natable was on 1 July 1990, when Boon Lay Bus Interchange and MRT Station was officially opened and marked the completion of the MRT system. My neighbourhood was served by up to 4 services at one time; 99, 175, 188 &amp; 242. 175 &amp; 188 were long gone. 99 have been the longest in service. It was the first and the sole survivor since I moved. I love my 99. Sometimes reliable, sometimes not but it always gets me there. I depend on it to get to primary school, to secondary school, to polytechnic and now to work. I take it almost everyday and have grown very attached to it, no mater what kind of bus it uses. It has grown from using single-decks to double decks and Superbuses, from non-a/c to partial a/c and now full a/c. From Atlanteans to Olympians, from B57 to B10M. I can go on and on. I hope 99 will continue in Jurong West for more years to come, serving its residents dutifully just like it did for the past 15 years.</div>

Excellent buses (but sadly no Tridents but got every other normal kind of SBS bus except Mk2 &amp; VO 2x) and excellent services.

            <div class='col-md body'>The name "Choa Chu Kang" is derived from the word "kang chu". In the late eighteenth century or the early nineteenth century, the Sultan of Johor allowed the Chinese immigrants to plant "ganmi" and pepper along the river bank. These immigrants were called "Kangchu"-the word "kang" means river and "chu" is the clan name of the first headman in charge of the plantations in the area.<br><br>Well, I maybe a new resident @ CCK, but I know a lot.I've been living in CCK for 6 years. The day I moved in was just a few weeks after the handover of services 300,302,307,172.<br><br>My house is like the most perfect place you can find. A bus stop opposite my block, a stadium opposite my house &amp; also sheltered linkway.It's quite lively too. There have not been much changes in the buses lately.The only major thing about buses is the 307 issue.<br><br>307 was cut short back in 2000. Teck Whye residents got angry and complained to the MPs and also Tibs. In 2001, 307 was partly restored. In 2002, Tibs decided to restore the old route. May be a good thing to Teck Whye residents but not good to me! Because of that, 307 doesn't have bendys!<br><br>Amazingly, CCK transformed from a quiet neighbourhood in 1995 to a bustling town come 1999. Thanks to the construction of Lot 1 Shoppers Mall, the civic centre and the extension of CCK int. CCK int looks very different from what it was back then.<br><br>If you people are looking for a house in a lively but peaceful district, I'll recommend CCK, especially the Yew Tee Area. The houses isn't very small and also served by a good transportation network. btw, it is the only neighbourhood to have an expressway semi-underground in the middle of CCK.<br><br>Choa Chu Kang- The heavenly nest in the West...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bukit Batok<br><br>Literally meant "Coughing Hill". Quite a number of tourists will mix this town name with something else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... no offense. Btw, the pioneer svc of Bukit Batok still around today is svc 173. From Princess Elizabeth Ter - Prince Edward, it slowly shortened to become Bt Batok - Clementi. There used to have a svc 366 linking between Bt Batok Ter to BBDEP then in 1984/5. Missed the good old days of SBS, with 189 covering some of 366's route. Btw, during the 1990s, quite a number of murder cases over there which seemed too horrible to go there... anyway, that's just an incomplete info on Bt Batok.... to be continued..</div>
