The new services lately hasn't duplicate the train lines, even to the same destination will take much longer compared to direct train services. Hence I believe even with a bus-train model running parallel, the train lines will still have their fair share of commuters which allow them to profit.<br><br>Even if the bus-train system really comes into practise, the bus operator will still face the same old problem of "minimizing duplication of resources", even though it might be slightly relaxed. If anyone think that they will just let buses wreck havoc on train services, think again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell you, that Ms Saw Phaik Hwa can keep up with that attitude of hers. Sooner or later she's going to find trouble at her doorstep; when that time comes, she will never be able to clean it off her hands.<br><br>I can very safely tell you that almost everybody who relies on SMRT treat her as Public Enemy Number One. I mean, what kind of... faeces has SMRT gorged into our mouths? Lack of bus routes, old buses (Nissans...), cockroach-infested buses (I once opened the ventilation flap on one of the Malaysian Lances, and two cockroaches fell onto me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ), treating the bus business as a money-making joke, lengthening the frequency of MRT trains, modifying and cutting back bus routes without any regard, not introducing many new bus routes (Let's see what SMRT gave us between now and 2005: 922, 882, 902, 900A, 985W, 854E, 963E, Teacher's Estate, and what else? And for SBS Transit... let's see... 5, 185, 175, 43, 45, 48, 109, 52, 57, 58, 59, 85, 116 (although it was withdrawn - crazy stupid route  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ), 402, 408, 409, 10e, 14e, 196e, 174e, 97e, 151e, 74e, 1N, 2N, 3N, 4N, 5N, 6N, 7N, 8N, ... all right, I lost count (and I didn't even start with the shortworking trips!)), severe corner cutting, etc...<br><br>However, I'm not for an all-out mega-merger, but rather, I would like to see something like this:<br><br>Have the rail division of SMRT go to SBS Transit; SBS Transit's rail division will be renamed SMRT, but will be under ComfortDelGro. SMRT's bus and taxi division will go back to being a independent unit, and will go back to be known as Trans Island ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ). At the same time, allow a few more bus companies to come out; fund them if necessary. Scrap the territory system, and allow buses of any company to operate from anywhere. In this system, you would effectively have a main company running trains and buses, with smaller bus companies competing with it's bus division - which I feel is OK for competition.</div>
