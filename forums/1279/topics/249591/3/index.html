            <div class='col-md body'>Well I dont know if we should blame SMRT for the standards they give vis-a-vis SBST.<br><br>No comments for the MRT where its rather straight forward - longer frequency = more pax per train = more profits per train = more trains in depot = save on driver costs. Apparently they find keeping the train in the depot and cutting the driver more profitable than putting more trains to induce commuters to take the train.<br><br>SMRT currently faces problems in its bus side (cant be bothered if there's any in the MRT Taxis side). First of all the driver's basic pay is lower than SBST. So more prospective employees would join SBST instead. This causes a shortage of manpower to drive the buses.<br><br>Secondly, due to manpower shortage means some buses may not run certain trips, especially in the morning when drivers report to work.<br><br>Thirdly, ALSO due to manpower shortage and little buses means tight running time for the services. Means drivers running like crazy and facing fatigue everyday. Imagine 61 67 858 965 966.<br><br>They got a small bus fleet and a smaller spare bus fleet. With them not buying new buses for the past few years means no new services anytime soon unless they take the Nissans from 608 and put them on some new route. Means no direct connections to Kranji Camp la, Bt Panjang to Sengkang la...<br><br>As for SBST to sell bendies if they take over SMRTB, compare the cost of selling them (as well as the no of years left running here) VS the cost of buying new buses and take which one is more profitable.<br><br>As for Dart on 922, B9 on 960, VO on 188.... firstly you need to train the drivers to drive them. For the moment if they merge the bus ops the BCs will stick to their buses and gradually they will learn other models. This is of course if Depot Transfer occurs.<br><br>Improvements to be made? yah SMRT has a LONG way to improve... improve your staff costs first and recruit more drivers first. Then we talk about service availability, then talk about running time, then talk about better service.<br><br>For your info, due to the delay of the opening of NEL, SBST has asked for compensation of the LTA for a sum of $50k / $500k (Refer to Extraordinary Items in the Income Statement FY03).</div>
