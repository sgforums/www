            <div class='col-md body'>$MRT should take this as a wake up call not to fool around with their buses and trains anymore and think only about money, and start improving their services. And no, that doesn't mean stupid gimmicks - it means three very basic things:<br><br>Â• proper maintenance of their buses, trains, and MRT tracks - do you know how many times I encountered slowed-down trains recently because of this? I used to be able to count it in one hand; now I need two, and maybe my feet. And their buses - I really want to puke when I see the condition of some of their buses, and it's not just the Nissans - which, I believe, could be in a much better condition.)<br>Â• better coverage of bus routes - I can tell you, the way $MRT route bus routes in Choa Chu Kang, Sembawang, Bukit Panjang, most parts of Wodlands, and the Yishun East area, it seems like they are making a joke out of everybody who lives , study, or work there. I recently had to go to Kranji Camp III - I will never forget that tiring walk thanks to (the lack of) $MRT's services.<br>Â• better service frequency - I don't want to wait for 9 minutes for a train, nor do I ever want to see &gt;15 minute-frequency ever for the MRT, nor do I want similar frequencies on heavy-demand, inter-town, and town-city bus routes, <span style="font-style: italic;">arigato</span>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since they always talk about the territory things, why not they take over the bus services which go through a strech of SBST territory. Like Svc 854 (Then will be seeing "854 AMDEP, 854 BNDEP" on deployment page). Then if SMRT no matter what want to keep the high demand services like 190, maybe SBST can take over some services and let SMRT "save" their buses. All B9TLs are not fully deployed on bus services, they could use maybe some older buses when B9TLs deployed on the "original" SBST svcs.<br><br>Heard that 902 got very high demand during peak hours, if taken over, DDs will sure be deployed!<br><br>Imagine: Mk3 on 950, Johor to Singapore public buses are all SBST(Excluding CW svc, SJE (something like this)).</div>
