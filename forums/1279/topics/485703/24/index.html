              <p>It is a 38x series DD - It is from SBST... not LTA or BSEP...

              <p>It also tried DDs on 228 but realized did not need.</p>
              <p>It is LTA BSEP who is stubborn who has put DDs on 119 and does
              not bother to take them out and give to other service instead. Have

              <p>But it still would be accepted into sg. Don't forget the longest bus we have operated is 14.5m although its no longer in operation. Like u said just not all routes could use it.</p>

              The purpose of TEL is not to connect Woodnds and the east. You will have future North Coast Line to do that (if the branch of CRL to Punggol is extended).

              A bit too late to post this... Yesterday I was at TPE bus stop (towards SLE) from 6pm to 6.15pm.
              Observations:
              - More people are using the bus stop compared to Sunday. There were about 20-30 pax in average waiting at the SLE-bound bus stop, but the Changi-bound bus stop only had less than 10 pax. For services towards Sengkang (27, 88 &amp; 89), usually 5-10 pax would alight at the bus stop, while almost nobody alighted from sv 3 &amp; 34. 
              - At the bus stop towards SLE, there were slightly more people waiting for services towards Punggol (bus stop 1a) than Sengkang (1b). For the bus stop towards Changi, almost all people were waiting for services towards Tampines (1a) and I saw nobody at bus stop 1b towards Pasir Ris. There were times when sv 27/88 pass by the bus stop without stopping.
              - There were some staff (probably from LTA) at the SLE-bound bus stop guiding passengers and giving out 'flyers' showing the map of the bus stop.

              Most of its route are super express,And express doesnt need the under 10mins requirement for peak periods too..If its 15-20 mins per bus then consider yourself lucky..Complain also no use its express service..
