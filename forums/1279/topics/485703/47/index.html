              <p>i think the reason why PPSS are not high in demand because a lot

              <p>I think by now most people should be aware of it. LTA has done lot of public image building by advertising PPSS. Also at interchanges/bus-stops you have PPSS bus details. Moreover at some places, you have ground staff forcing u to enter PPSS bus even if you don't want to.</p>
              <p>PPSS has been introduced for a year now, so I don't think it is much of an awareness problem given these are feeder services. for ex: If you are living at Chai Chee, you will inevitably see a 222P everyday when you head out. Same for 268P, 240P, 291P etc. As there are not so many buses plying inner roads for ppl to miss out on the P variant.</p>
              <p>Just that PTO service frequency is not bad for feeders and ppl don't mind waiting for a 291 DD rather than taking the PPSS variant. </p>

              <p>I agree that awareness could still be a problem BUT it is also reluctance on part of commuters to board the P variant (even those who are aware). I mean for someone taking the bus on daily or weekly basis, wouldn't he/she know where 903P would ply? If they are concerned about additional fees, would someone not ask and clarify? </p>

              <p>Again.. this is case of reluctance that ppl want to board the PTO bus... who would not know that 903P will go to WRI.. ofcourse and I sincerely hope ppl have that much common sense.</p>
              <p>I have seen this even on 268P. People just refuse to board the bus. 4-6 pax board at AMK. After 2-3 mins you have sv 76 come, you will see 30-40 pax board the bus. 268P has been in operation for very long time now.</p>

              <p>And IIRC, they either converted / moved 6305H to an A/P slot. I see that bus even at noon nowadays. 6305H came in back then as a peak-hour-only add though IIRC.</p>

              <p>903P is surviving so far so good~~ if only they installed bus stopping bell to speed up the journey..otherwise very jialat.</p>
              <p>Many Private operators failed to install bus stopping bell on their buses as the coach isn't designed to have that. This is one area where LTA didn't look into to improve it. Haven't checkout SMRT's BusPlus 285P and 265P..but hopefully they have bus stopping bell installed since their old Toyota have them..</p>
