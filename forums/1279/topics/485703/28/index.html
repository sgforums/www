              <p>I know you want 243 to be routed to Pioneer but reality is that this is not going to happen and there is NO need.</p>
              <p>i will tell you why</p>
              <p>1. You have 192/193 connecting  Jurong West ave 4 to Pioneer (guess what - ppl prefer to take bus to Boon Lay instead of Pioneer)</p>
              <p>2. You have 185 from  Jurong West Ave 5 to Pioneer (guess what - you will not see many pax take 185 to Pioneer but rather take 242/181 to Boon Lay)</p>
              <p>3. St 61 will be deleted where 243 is the only service and there are a good 20-25 pax alighting at this stop when u take 243W in PM. </p>
              <p>4. Pioneer MRT is not the preferred option for many ppl.. As ppl like to go to Boon Lay as it has many options apart from MRT. </p>

              <p>Hi Mr BusAnalayzer, I am sorry but I have to correct your first sentence. Well, yes, when Pioneer MRT Station opened, I really wanted some form of bus connection to my house from Pioneer MRT Station, as with everyone else when there is a new MRT Station (or Bus Interchange) opening near their house.</p>
              <p>However, after observing the bus services for a while, I realised that it is better to not re-route 243 to Pioneer MRT Station, because this would only increase the length and lengthen travelling times, and would especially implicate people staying at Jurong West Avenue 5 and Street 81 whom may want to go to Jurong Point (or Boon Lay Bus Interchange) or go home from there.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, there has to be some kind of service enhancement at Jurong West Street 75/64 side, some time in the future (eg. if either 192 or 193, or both, is removed from Jurong West Street 64/75 and Avenue 4) when all services types (eg. Short Working Trips) and capacity enhancement has been exhausted on 243 and 181, yet there is still a shortage of bus services experienced.  </p>
              <p>One option is to create a new bus route and have new bus services there from Boon Lay Bus Interchange, while the other option is to re-route 242 to Pioneer MRT Station. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">As mentioned at </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=35">page 35</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> and </span><a style="line-height: 1.231;" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=36">page 36</a><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> of 'Route Suggestions (Part 5)', re-routing 242 would enable people to take 242 from another place (Pioneer MRT Station, apart from Boon Lay Bus Interchange) and reduce the loading on 242 at every section of the route.</span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, that is in the future (at least when Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens) and even so, 243 should not be the one that is re-routed to Pioneer MRT Station, unless this is the best option.</p>
              <p>In fact, rather than extending it to Pioneer MRT Station, I would prefer 243 to ply directly to Jurong West Street 81 from Jurong West Street 61, skipping Jurong West Avenue 4 and 5, and Pioneer Road North. However, this would result in a loss of bus connection between Jurong West Street 81 and Pioneer Road North - especially to people staying nearer to Pioneer Secondary School - unless there is a new bus service (route) that duplicates the Jurong West Street 81-Pioneer Road North section, then only can we afford to make 243 skip Pioneer Road North and ply directly to Jurong West Street 61 from Jurong West Street 81.</p>

              <p>The Peak Period Bus Services initiative was launched on 14 April this year, <a href="http://www.publictransport.sg/content/dam/publictransport/pdf/peak_period_service/Peak_Period_Short_Services_Poster.pdf">"where private bus operators are tapped to run shorter bus services to complement the existing feeder services to help alleviate crowding and reduce waiting time during peak hours."</a></p>
              <p>However, there is poor response on such services because <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/stomper-surprised-to-be-picked-up-by-private-bus-with-real-bus-numbers-and-routes">people are not comfortable with taking private buses on public bus services</a>. As such, the Peak Period Bus Services does not seem to be an effective initiative to enhance bus services.</p>
              <p>I am just wondering. Rather than having the Peak Period Bus Services of (only) Feeder Bus Services and getting private bus operators to run them, would it be more effective to have Short Working Trips of all types (Regardless of Feeder or Trunk) of normal Bus Services and get the public bus operators (SBS Transit and SMRT) to run them?</p>
              <p>If the concern is on limited resources, we can have the Short Working Trips run by a public bus operator that is different than the public bus operator running the normal Bus Services. For instance, we can get SMRT to run a Short Working Trip of 240 (a SBS Transit bus service) and get SBS Transit to run a Short Working Trip of 307 (a SMRT bus service).</p>

              option is to re-route 242 to Pioneer MRT Station. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">As mentioned at</span> <a style="line-height: 1.231;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=35">page 35</a> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">and</span> <a style="line-height: 1.231;" rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1279/topics/477158?page=36">page
              36</a> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">of 'Route Suggestions
              (Part 5)', re-routing 242 would enable people to take 242 from
              another place (Pioneer MRT Station, apart from Boon Lay Bus
              Interchange) and reduce the loading on 242 at every section of the
              route.</span></p>
              <p>Nonetheless, that is in the future (at least when Joo Koon Bus
              Interchange opens) and even so, 243 should not be the one that is
              re-routed to Pioneer MRT Station, unless this is the best
              option.</p>
              <p>In fact, rather than extending it to Pioneer MRT Station, I
              would prefer 243 to ply directly to Jurong West Street 81 from
              Jurong West Street 61, skipping Jurong West Avenue 4 and 5, and
              Pioneer Road North. However, this would result in a loss of bus
              connection between Jurong West Street 81 and Pioneer Road North -
              especially to people staying nearer to Pioneer Secondary School -
              unless there is a new bus service (route) that duplicates the
              Jurong West Street 81-Pioneer Road North section, then only can we
              afford to make 243 skip Pioneer Road North and ply directly to
              Jurong West Street 61 from Jurong West Street 81.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So we agree re-routing 243 will not be possible. Also, if you see this estate - it is completely mature with NO new housing estate coming up along route 243 or Jurong West Ave 4/5. So more or less the number of ppl is not going to increase in a huge way in coming years, compared to areas like Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, CCK, Yishun, Sengkang, Punggol.</p>
              <p>So I don't think there will be a new service introduced to connect st 81/85 to Pioneer MRT. And one out of 192/193 will still stay, so both Jurong West Ave 4 and 5 will be connected to Pioneer MRT even in future.</p>
              <p>I hope this explains the rationale.</p>

              <p>Recommend LTA to introduce 2 more timings for sv 851E and 951E in PM with these timings:</p>

              <p>Deploy 4 rigids on both services. I am sure each of these buses will start getting more pax.</p>

              In fact make it this way
              850E Am peak 7 trips(3 DDs/4 SDs) Pm peak 4 trips(1 DD/3 SDs)
              868 Am peak 3 trips Pm peak 2 trips with all SDs
