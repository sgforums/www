              <p>LTA needs to do much more for sv 850E/951E for PM peak. I think should deploy 4 buses on each with interval of 15 mins. All 4 can be MAN buses. Need to start encouraging ppl to take bus on way back also.</p>
              <p>I already see on both sv 850E and sv 951E that at Dhoby Ghaut bus has got a good 50-55 pax. If add more buses, might see more people convert from MRT --&gt; Bus especially those for whom it is point to point service.</p>

              <p>Spotted both <strong>SBS6522Y</strong> and <strong>SBS6523U </strong>on Sv 359 today. </p>
              <p>Which brings me to this guess: Is it possible if they actually dumped 2x BSEP add for Sv 359 this time round for the 13 additional trips? Because if anyone took a look at the freq during Peak Hours now, it's drastically improved. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Shortest 4 mins max 7 mins freq during 5pm-7pm sector is way faster than what I had recalled previously. And because the e-tt shows round trips from PSR Int (ie West Loop first before continuing on East loop), I actually think about 7x round trips per day for each bus is plausible if both are S-shift adds (assuming both are fleet adds to Sv 359). Hmm.</p>

              faster than what I had recalled previously. And because the e-tt
              shows round trips from PSR Int (ie West Loop first before
              continuing on East loop), I actually think about 7x round trips per
              day for each bus is plausible if both are S-shift adds (assuming
              both are fleet adds to Sv 359). Hmm.</p>
              <p>Opinions?</p>

              <p>Yes. I believe sv 359 has got 2 BSEP fleet add. It is also BSEP feeder trend if you notice. In last few rounds, gave 2 buses at one time to sv 315, 410, 243, 291, 261, 269 etc. </p>

              <p>But if Sv 359 has 2 BSEP adds this time, that would mean:<br><br>1) Sv 359P has been failing too badly that they have to add 2 BSEP adds to the main Sv 359 svc?<br><br>2) Sv 358's load drastically pales in comparison to Sv 359.

And Sv 359P has 45-seater buses, while Sv 358P only has minibuses. Drastically different.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'll observe again to see if both buses are still on Sv 359 over the next few days.</p>

              <p>No, reason is commuters themselves don't want to take the P variants and are happy with the PTO feeder services. Since you live in Tampines, you will know that very few ppl voluntarily take the P variant. The queue hardly moves. Hence, LTA had to add BSEP buses to 291/293. Same story now with 359.</p>

              <p>IMO, the P variant has failed to attract commuters almost on all services. The only better fared ones are 222P and 912P that too bcoz 222 has not got any improvement for years and 912P west loop there has been so much rise in loading coz of new condos but still only 912 plying without more bendy buses added. </p>
              <p>240P and 268P are faring the worst IMO. </p>

              <p>Agree, there are still passengers who go onboard the bus and ask whether if PPSS charges the same fares and does it go to the interchange. Also most of the elderly would not bother boarding coaches as it is not easy for them to get on and off.</p>
              <p>Here is what I would suggest to help improve the PPSS services:<br>1. LTA should specify only city buses and intercity buses as part of the requirement.<br>2. An electronic display to display the route details and number (or a standard sized destination plate) should be installed/placed on the bus so that commuters would not miss the PPSS buses (currently not many people flag down the bus throughout the route).<br>3. A notice pasted at the interchanges, bus stops, residential blocks and the PPSS bus itself to indicate to the commuters that the fare charged is the same as the normal feeder service (one of the main reasons why commuters avoid PPSS buses is because that they are not sure of the fares).<br>4. For PPSS that only run part of the feeder route, a notice familiar to the commuters in that area should be pasted to indicate that the bus does not cover the full journey (an example is the 'T' plate for 291P, 293P like what MyBus did for 359P).<br>5. Adjust the timetable to ensure that the PTO and PPSS bus does not bunch up while departing, for example the frequency can be varied instead of a fixed frequency (a common complaint from drivers is that since the timings and frequency for the PPSS buses is already fixed by LTA, there are instances where the bus departs at the same time or very close after the PTO's bus, and then leaving quite a bad frequency for the next bus).<br>6. Transitlink app could include bus arrival timings for PPSS services, so that commuters can choose to wait for the PPSS bus if it is arriving soon.</p>
