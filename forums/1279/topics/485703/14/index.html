              <p>They divide the long stop into two sections, bus stop 1a and bus stop 1b. The numbers at bus stop 1a are 27, 34, 168, 858 and 969. </p>
              <p>The numbers at bus stop 1b are 3, 39, 88, 89, 89e and 109.</p>
              <p>However, they have not peeled off the bus stickers for 168, 39 and 109. This means they may implement them later at stages.</p>
              <p>So to all those earlier doubters that say they will select certain bus services not to play there due to crowdiness or other factors, they should be proven wrong now. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr azharjj, i think the greatest impact will be smrt 858 and 969. 858-1 stop to changi airport and 969-1 stop to tampines mrt/int. 858 and 969 bring us to sembawang, yishun, woodlands on the other side.</p>
              <p>Foresee some load drop in sbs 27 and 34 though may not be very significant.</p>
              <p>Foresee some further increase in load in sbs 3 which will be heavily taxed as sbs 3 goes around punggol 1 whole loop to bring people out to TPE stop to transfer. After that, loading will drop slightly because people will take sbs 88 to pasir ris int via the faster pasir ris drive 3 instead of sbs 3. </p>
              <p>Of course, i foresee some other loading patterns to change which i shall not elaborate due to lengthy essays which others may not like. Thanks. </p>
              <p>Cheers to all who live in this part of the island! Finally we have an alavanche of bus services providing many alternatives. This is only seen in those centralised areas previously.</p>

              <p>I would say that 28's windy part would be Tampines estate, that's why many people will take the trunk service from Tampines Int to get back home... Also for the Toa Payoh to Paya Lebar part, you have 8 from Toa Payoh going to Macpherson, then you can just change to 28 or another bus from there... Also note that 28 goes by Braddell Road and Bartley Road, this sector does bring passengers to Paya Lebar directly (unlike 155). I have ever lived near Braddell Road (Bishan) and I remember taking 28 from there to Paya Lebar MRT (when Eunos Road 8 was still used for the bus stop bside Singapore Post). I also took 155 once during that time and it was too long... Okay, that's it for 28.</p>
              <p>To be honest, I don't think 51 is that windy... It is a direct route from Hougang Ctrl to Hougang Ave 3/Eunos MRT. The only areas that waste time are Geylang Road, North Bridge Road/Victoria Street (and the loop around Queenway). Otherwise, I find that 51 is direct and not windy... Sure, the travelling time is too long, so I hope 51 can be amended to go express on some secotrs to reduce the travelling time and improve the frequency... </p>

              <p>Hi mr azharjj, i think the greatest impact will be smrt 858 and
              969. 858-1 stop to changi airport and 969-1 stop to tampines
              mrt/int. 858 and 969 bring us to sembawang, yishun, woodlands on
              the other side.</p>
              <p>Foresee some load drop in sbs 27 and 34 though may not be very
              significant.</p>
              <p>Foresee some further increase in load in sbs 3 which will be
              heavily taxed as sbs 3 goes around punggol 1 whole loop to bring
              people out to TPE stop to transfer. After that, loading will drop
              slightly because people will take sbs 88 to pasir ris int via the
              faster pasir ris drive 3 instead of sbs 3. </p>
              <p>Of course, i foresee some other loading patterns to change which
              i shall not elaborate due to lengthy essays which others may not
              like. Thanks. </p>
              <p>Cheers to all who live in this part of the island! Finally we
              have an alavanche of bus services providing many alternatives. This
              is only seen in those centralised areas previously.</p>

              <p>A late reply to your off-topic question: It can be considered one of the first 'M' services (not counting the former Nite Owl services which were labelled with 'M' as well), 8 alternative SBST bus services/short trips deemed to be more like alternatives were re-labelled with 'M' in January 2008. (e.g. the former 98A which plied between Jurong East and Jln Ahmad Ibrahim is re-labelled as 98M then).</p>
