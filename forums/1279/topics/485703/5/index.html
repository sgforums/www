              <p><br>Problem is none of these changes can easily happen as you do not have very good exit to Woodlands Road from Yew tee. Even via Sungei Kadut, the routing is complicated and off-peak no demand. This is my analysis why none of the Woodland bound trunk services or CCK trunks do not ply Yew Tee.</p>
              <p>Though my suggestion is a trunk can start from CCK interchange (considering there is no space for interchange/terminal around Yew Tee MRT). After it starts from  CCK Interchange, trunk can travel via CCK Dr, CCK North 5, CCK North 6 and come down via CCK Way and continue towards Bukit Panjang or Bukit Batok.</p>
              <p>I would suggest route such as 171 can be diverted to CCK via proposed route as anyway with opening of DTL, this route will become redundant BPJ onwards. OR can introduce a new route but I feel Yew Tee residents deserve a trunk service.</p>

              <p>Brickland Road is experiencing a similar situation as well (only one bus stop either side). Major southbound trunk routes are routed through Teck Whye, which is a more mature estate.</p>

              Bt Batok just need one feeder and a svc to northeast..852 can extend to Tengah in future..
              CCK need a bus terminal near Yew Tee..And of course a couple of svc.
              BPJ new Int hopefully can accomodate another 2 svc.
              Woodlands North should have 4 trunk and 2 feeders for a start.
              Yishun new Int should have another trunk to West.
              Sembawang need a feeder and its good to have 171 starts there and cut short to Bt Batok.
              
              Actually no need Kranji since Bulim will be handed to them..What they need a new bigger Amdep and a bus park along Western corridors preferably near Labrador..
