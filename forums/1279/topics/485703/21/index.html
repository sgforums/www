              <p>I suggest they have the "city direct" on weekends too. </p>
              <p>Ease loading on MRT and also provide much better alternative.
              Also further encourages <span style="line-height: 1.231;">weekend shoppers in the non-MRT areas to give
              up cars.</span></p>
              <p>And thus the puzzling question: Why are the Cityshopper routes
              axed? Too expensive?</p>

              <p>Agreed... they should have city direct 850E and 951E with a little route modified.. instead of going Shenton should loop around Thomson... can also run full day unlike weekdays coz many ppl like to throng to Orchard area... Additional buses can be added as any way fleet is less for most buses on sundays/ph.</p>

              <p>Hi mr carbikebus, frankly speaking of course I will like these 2 routes. But I don't see it coming, even in the future. The routes will be very lengthy and they do not fit in their plans of 'mrt first, bus second.' Punggol being situated at 1 end still does not have direct bus service to town or CBD.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, circle line benefits many NE residents immensely more than others. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">In a few years time, the downtown line will benefit many in the northeast too since there is little India interchange for us to hop on to. This should eliminate those super long distance bus services which we all want them to introduce. Cheers.</span></p>

              <p>MRT FIRST?! I gotta laugh man. </p>
              <p>Even in HK you alr have many ppl voicing against the idea alr.
              In what state of mind are you thinking that 3,4 car trains running

              <p>I mean, surely you couldnt be thinking that car owners lust for
              a crammed, 20+ stop journey with countless transfers more than cars
              when going from east to west?!</p>
              <p>I tell you firsthand, I gave up faith in the country's MRT
              system when they announced the TEL plan. With such a long network
              and serving so densely populated areas with such a long line and
              all it gets are... 4-car trains.</p>
              <p>I really dont see how ppl will really think the MRT is a
              pleasure to utilise with all these medium-capacity lines popping up
              everywhere. The CCL is already struggling under optimum capacity
              along the Thomson to Paya Lebar stretch, yet LTA REFUSE to learn
              its lesson and continue to spam the island with these lines! Even
              at places without support of existing trunk lines eg. Marine Parade
              and Bukit Panjang!</p>
              <p>I hope the CRL will prove me wrong. But until then I strongly
              support long-haul express buses and I think SG is not yet quite
              ready to make MRT "first". </p>

              <p>DTL has to use 3-car trains because it has to use the provisions at Bayfront (cross-platform transfer with CCL) and Chinatown (DTL platforms were designed together with NEL). That's why LTA has ordered a great number of trains for DTL to ensure its frequency.</p>
              <p>CRL will use at least 6-car trains according to the documents, and 8-car trains are possible.</p>

              <p>Yes... LTA needs to introduce going forward 2 types of routes</p>
              <p>1. Feeder services for new housing hubs that do not have connectivity to at least one MRT (very much needed like sv 386 or sv 4 - not feeder but similar principle)</p>
              <p>2. Services like 50 and 972...that connects many estates and are long distance... </p>
              <p>3. No routes like 51 and 61 that are super long. Routes should be between 15 and 25 kms with exception of those that ply long distance on expressway then 30 kms is okay</p>
              <p>4. Please stop introducing more services lik 116, 120, 49... all these are okay in their own right but should have been longer... 49 should ideally have looped somewhere around Jurong West Ave 4/5 or Boon Lay (without terminating at interchange), 116 should def have been longer (this service has such poor loading), 120 also should have been longer (Bukit Merah via Tehlok Blangah going further). </p>

              <p>They should still have short service eg. 38, 69, for short distance pax. </p>
              <p>Only with short service can you then make more long trunks express. </p>
              <p>Honestly I really dont know what is holding LTA back from introducing express long trunks. If it is problems of cost then charge express svcs fees lah, this is no longer the 80's where ppl are so stingy about their spending on public transport. After all, time is money. If it is problems of loading support I dont see the problem either as the fact that a service is express will alr have attracted many to use the service, and as long as it is direct and pass by town centres... Example is one of my favourite routes in HK, NWFB 798... Plying minimal residential areas with 70% of its journey on expressway, yet forming extremely long queues during peak and especially weekends. </p>

              its lesson and continue to spam the island with these lines! Even
              at places without support of existing trunk lines eg. Marine Parade
              and Bukit Panjang!</p>
              <p>I hope the CRL will prove me wrong. But until then I strongly
              support long-haul express buses and I think SG is not yet quite
              ready to make MRT "first". </p>

              <p>But can't simply look at the number of train cars. I'd rather have 4 cars at 2mins interval than 6 cars at 3min or even 8 cars at 4mins. A compromise has to be made somewhere. Afterall it is a medium density line (If you don't understand the concept, look at U-bahn services in Germany).</p>
              <p>What I really don't like as well is the high density of stops. It is as if you are planning a new bus route that stops every 800m instead of 400m, except that it is on a track and in tunnels. Makes it suffer all the disadvantages of buses (many stops), trains (long dwell times, high building cost - probably 20 to 30bil this time for the whole TEL) and making it really not comparable with the comfort and speed of cars.</p>
              <p>They just don't seem to be looking towards making something that car users will want to utilise, but rather to just force them use public transport by lowering the COE quota/quantity.</p>

              <p>Someway I feel DTL west is better planned than TSL.</p>
              <p>TSL you have Bright Hill and Upper Thomson so close.. Again you have Napier, Orchard Boulevard and Orchard - three stops so close by... even by bus it is like 5 stops between Napier and Orchard... dunno what they are thinking while planning so many stations..</p>
              <p>You just kill the speed and the bus network around as well.</p>
