              <p>These HDBs are around 800m-1km away from Oasis... depending on HDB location... they ofcourse need a service.</p>
              <p>Plus sv 386 will get extended in future along Waterway ... if you saw new HDB announcement.. yet more projects announced along Waterway near Punggol east. </p>

              <p>I dont agree with your statement for sv 386.. you need to see the purpose of this service... it is for new Waterway HDB residents that have no LRT/bus service... Also you should see like Keat Hong... Waterway is the next huge development.</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, yes it is a bit redundant. Sbs 136 also serves
              Punggol central. As seen from my other post, sbs 386 makes
              residents along edgefield plains walk much lesser. It also helps
              alleviate crowded sbs 3 and 83 and 85 from Punggol mrt to the east
              end of Punggol central, bringing it to the level of yr 2010 when
              spectra is not there yet. Nowadays spectra bus stop is quite heavy
              passenger load. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, before you say I am highly mistaken in bold, I think you are the one who is highly mistaken. Go to the actual place and check it out first, ok? Sbs 386 will turn left to edgefield plains. There will be a pair of new bus stops right there near to spectra which I think you conveniently left out or you are not aware of. The pair of new bus stops 65381 and 65389 will serve Punggol spectra residents as well as the 2 huge rented blocks and the church. Take note Punggol spectra residents are a mere 100 to 150 metres away from edgefield plains. So your rationale is wrong and my reasoning is right. It will offload some of those who take sbs 3/83/85 and let those who take sbs 3/83/85 to the fourth Punggol central bus stop Blk 649 return to the pre-2010 timing level. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I am correct leh. Sbs 386 brings you to edgefield plains near the waterway. The waterway is huge. You cannot say sbs 386 brings you to waterway la. The waterway comprises many portions(Punggol rd, Punggol way, sentul crescent, edgefield plains, edgedale plains and Punggol east). So logically speaking sbs 386 only brings you to edgefield plains near the waterway. If you say it brings you to waterway, you are telling everybody it brings you to the whole waterway which in fact sbs 386 only brings you to one part of the waterway which is nearest edgefield plains.

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, this is how I judge.</p>
              <p>For people at spectra having cars -best! No need public transport.</p>
              <p>For people at spectra with no cars -no choice take sbs 3, 83, 85 alight at Punggol central, take sbs 386 alight at edgefield plains. LRT is no-no. No LRT nearby except oasis LRT which is 400 meters away. May as well take sbs 3, 83, 85 which brings to doorstep. (I observe heavy crowds getting off spectra bus stop on many evening nights)</p>
              <p>For people living at the 2 rented blocks at edgefield plains next to the church, 3 cheers for them. They have sbs 386 at their doorstep with the erection of a pair of new bus stops just outside their house. </p>
              <p>For people living deep inside edgefield plains near waterway, sbs 386 is the only choice (doorstep). Unless they want walk to Punggol drive take sbs 50 or oasis LRT or Damai LRT (within or not within walking distance depending on which block). Nobody does that just to connect to take mrt.</p>
              <p>For students (Punggol view, edgefield pri and Punggol sec), sbs 386 will be an extra service. If it comes, just take it. If not, just take sbs 3, 83, 85, 136. For Punggol view students, they have an extra sbs 34, 50, 84. Punggol view is just 300 meters from mrt. Walk there will do. No need take bus. Cheers.</p>

Also, you have 3 services - sv 3/83/85 - this means you have a bus every 04-05 minutes to Punggol Int... will you wait at the stop along central or walk to Edgefield plains and wait for bus for 10-12 mins?? </p>

              <p>The pair of bus stops is near Punggol Secondary school. Why
                  would anyone walk to Edgefield plains, when they have a pair of bus
                  stops right outside Spectra on Punggol Central? Also, you have 3
                  services - sv 3/83/85 - this means you have a bus every 04-05
                  minutes to Punggol Int... will you wait at the stop along central
                  or walk to Edgefield plains and wait for bus for 10-12
                  mins?? </p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, these are typical words from those who are not staying here. First there are many types of people. Some will cross roads. Some will not walk across the roads. For those staying near the edgefield plains, why need walk across the road and walk further down to the stop at Punggol central? How about the 2 rented blocks of flats which have the bus service just downstairs?</p>
              <p>Haha. 3 services guarantee you every 4 to 5 min? That is why you have to hand it to people who stayed in Punggol central near the end of the road. Words coming from somebody who does not stay there holds much less water than those who stay there. </p>
              <p>Sbs 85 frequency is out. More than 15 min. Sbs 3 goes very long winded route from tampines/pasir ris. At times, you can have 2 min frequency along Punggol central. At times you can wait until 20 min. Lucky we have sbs 83 which is the consistent 10 min per bus because there is some control at sengkang interchange where they segregate out the buses even though it is looping. </p>
              <p>So before you come out with those big words, please seek the opinion of those who stay here who certainly experience more than you. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, ok I am the dumbest guy in Singapore and you are the cleverest. Let me repeat. Sbs 386 is introduced for the HDB flats at edgefield plains nearest the waterway. Those housing estates along Punggol central and also the side estates lying at the fringe of edgefield plains such at Punggol spectra and Punggol breeze and edgedale green estates benefit. Even those outside at the far edges also benefit since they have a faster journey indirectly when people take to sbs 386. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I did not say it is launched for spectra residents. I say spectra residents benefit as it is along the route around the fringes. Not unlike you which you state sbs 386 did not go to spectra which you are totally wrong and refuse to admit it and say I am highly mistaken. You are the one who is highly mistaken! I also do not feel any sense to argue with you as I realize that you are 1 guy who always resort to big words to cover up when you are obviously in the wrong. When I did not antagonize you and you antagonize people first just like the case first when you type I am mistaken in bold. Look who is the one really mistaken!</p>

              <p>Dirty LTA trick. </p>
              <p>Trying to fill up its eighty svcs like this.</p>
              <p>Why not think in the long run and introduce a svc to Seletar/Yishun via the upcoming semi-expressway, bypassing that area and other Waterway flats? Instead of stop gap measures like this?</p>
              <p>Think this svc would be first to be scrapped under the new BSEP policy.</p>
              <p>And we can also re-route 85 to HG which for now has no direct service to Yishun as of now. So the new svc can replace 85 in Punggol.  </p>

              <p>Dirty LTA trick. </p>
              <p>Trying to fill up its eighty svcs like this.</p>
              <p>Why not think in the long run and introduce a svc to
              Seletar/Yishun via the upcoming semi-expressway, bypassing that
              area and other Waterway flats? Instead of stop gap measures like
              this?</p>
              <p>Think this svc would be first to be scrapped under the new BSEP
              policy.</p>
              <p>And we can also re-route 85 to HG which for now has no direct
              service to Yishun as of now. So the new svc can replace 85 in
              Punggol.  </p>

              <p>Yes... We need to see more long distance routes.. where are those?</p>
              <p>Need something from NEL to Woodlands via Punggol, Yishun..</p>
              <p>Need service from Sembawang to Bukit Batok via Woodlands, BPJ Ring road</p>
              <p>Need service from Sembawang to CCK via Yishun ring road, Mandai... </p>
              <p>** LTA we need more long distance routes.</p>
              <p>** On another note, 386 is needed... contrarty to what most are saying and I see that it will be extended to the full Waterway complex in future.</p>
