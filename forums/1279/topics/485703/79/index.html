              <p>BSEP Bus Service 258.</p>
                                                                              <p>The official frequency of service 258 is out.</p>
                                                                              <p>0630-0830 Hrs: 11 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>0831-1659 Hrs: 13 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>1700-1900 Hrs: 12 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>After 1900 Hrs: 13 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>The length of service 258 is 14.0km. This is 0.1km more than what I guessed it to be.</p>
                                                                              <p>The only official information still unknown about service 258 is estimated travelling time. My guess is 65 mins, which should be more or less about the same as the official information.</p>
                                                                              <p>The frequency reveals two things:</p>
                                                                              <p>1. Around six buses will be deployed on service 258.</p>
                                                                              <p>2. Around six trips may be removed from bus services 243G and 243W. ^</p>
                                                                              <p>Meanwhile, the frequency of new service 256 is slightly better. I guess this is to make up for the loss of service 257, while compensate for the reduction of frequency on service 243G/243W. Fair enough.</p>
                                                                              <p>If the frequency of service 243G and 243W is adjusted to accommodate service 258, I hope they could maintain the number of trips at affected bus stops.</p>
                                                                              <p>That is, if a bus stop with only service 243 now has ten trips per hour, they should ensure that even if they reduce the number of trips on service 243, there is still ten trips at that bus stop - with service 258 making up for it.</p>
                                                                              <p>Well, I have done the calculations. Even if we adjust the frequency of service 243G/W to correspond with that of service 258, there should not be much impact on the frequency during peak hours.</p>
                                                                              <p>^ The possible new frequency of service 243G/W may be this:</p>
                                                                              <p>0630-0830: 4 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>0831-1659: 8.6 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>1700-1900: 6 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>After 1900: 13 mins</p>
                                                                              <p>If this is the new frequency, this means it would be one to two minutes longer the wait for service 243 during peak hours, which I think it is acceptable, since it is only one two minutes more.</p>
                                                                              <p>During other hours, waiting time may be longer by four to ten minutes. I think it is okay, given service 243G/W seems more for intra-town connections during other hours. Besides, areas without service 258 or 256 already have services 241 and 179.</p>
                                                                              <p>Anyway, I am disappointed with the frequency of service 258. It is lower than the frequency of services 860 and 49 that serve the same purpose. In fact, it is identical to the frequency of service 102.</p>
                                                                              <p>Looking at how many people take bus from Pioneer Road North to Pioneer Station, it would be good if Double-Decker buses are used on service 258, and if we could see the schedule, so we would not have to wait long at the bus stop.</p>
                                                                              <p>In terms of route, I feel that services 102 and 258 are similar. While service 258 (14.0km) is shorter than service 102 (17.4km), the travel time (~65 mins) may be longer than service 102 (~55 mins).</p>

              <p>Hi mr pathlight, please make some sensible comments. In yr 2002,
              sbs 502 went to sengkang does not mean it has to be extended to
              sengkang this yr end. In any way, it does not look possible as
              route is too long. Nowadays seldom people take a bus journey
              exceeding 80% of the route. Most people cannot stand such long
              journeys anymore. Cheers. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I guess that after the expanded BSEP, there will be no more new bus service launched, if there is no reduction in number of bus services.</p>
                      <p>The reason is because there may be a cap on how many bus services there will eventually be in Singapore, since there are twelve GCM packages and it seems that every package use one depot only.</p>
                      <p>One depot can accommodate around 500 to 550 buses. If every depot can accommodate around 525 buses, this means eventually, there will be around 6,300 buses, and thatâ€™s probably the maximum number.</p>
                      <p>If a depot of 500 buses can accommodate around 25.5 bus services, if the maximum number of buses is around 6300, this means there will only be up to around 321.3 bus services eventually.</p>
                      <p>As of year 2014, SBS Transit has 230 bus services (207 basic + 23 niche) and SMRT has 89 bus services (50 trunk + 22 feeder + 10 express + 7 nightrider). Total 319.</p>
                      <p>With 319 bus services as of year 2014, this means we may have already reach the limit of around 321.3 bus services. In future, there will likely be mergers and withdrawal of bus services. Otherwise, having twelve depots is not enough and there has to be more than twelve depots in Singapore.</p>

              <p>As of year 2014, SBS Transit has 230 bus services (207 basic + 23 niche) and SMRT has 89 bus services (50 trunk + 22 feeder + 10 express + 7 nightrider). Total 319.</p>
              <p>With 319 bus services as of year 2014, this means we may have already reach the limit of around 321.3 bus services. In future, there will likely be mergers and withdrawal of bus services. Otherwise, having twelve depots is not enough and there has to be more than twelve depots in Singapore.</p>

              <p>They can always build new depots and/or expand existing (or to-be-built) depots in future... In the future I think the number of bus services should still be on a rise, as we will have new towns (e.g. Tengah) that need new bus services, and new flats that need new bus services and fleet adds for existing services.</p>
              <p>And to me, what matters the most is not the number of bus services, but the number of buses. Merging some bus services may reduce the number of services, but it's not so effective in saving buses (unless there's duplication, e.g. 82 and 107).</p>

                  this extent. Even fireice the admin is not spared and he has a
                  clone called fffieice. Wonder if he will take any action? Cheers.
                  Thanks. </p>

              <p>This forum is old, it may not have some of the better functions that are accessible in newer forums, such as group ban, ability to run message filters and bots, etc. Once in a while we still see junk accounts created solely for advertisement. Thus it is possible that function-wise it is not efficient to carry out these admin actions.</p>
              <p>As for the willingness to ban ... I'm sure FireIce / ^tamago^ have experienced similar problems countless of times, but tamago is not always active and FireIce has to take care of all the forums, it will be tiring for her to come to the rescue everytime something such as this happens in some forum. It is possible that as a forum with a mature community, we are somewhat expected to settle minor problems ourselves, unless it involves serious or technical issues.</p>
              <p>So, ignore new users for the time being.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS n SMRT, I agree with you. Somebody is up to mischief.
              There is now even PornAnalyser and curbikebas. Really mimick the
              original users. This forum is tuening to a real farce. Hope the
              admins ban all the nicknames appearing after 11 nov 2015. Cheers.
              Thanks. </p>
