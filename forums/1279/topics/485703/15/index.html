              <p>Erm. The thing is, if Sv 410 is affected (like what you said with removing the 53/410 x-overs), there would be a e-tt change <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for both Sv 53 &amp; 410</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>But like what I had mentioned earlier, the e-tt change on 11 Aug <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only affected Sv 53</strong></span>. Sv 410's e-tt wasn't touched in this latest change. So I don't think it's due to removing any x-overs to Sv 410 for this 11 Aug revision. <br><br>But as to why Sv 410's last e-tt change was on 14 Jul, that might explain your 53/410 removal (ie. the 14 Jul change might be for the removal of that x-over, but not this 11 Aug e-tt change for Sv 53). Hope this clarifies your misunderstanding somewhat?</p>

              <p>Erm maybe you misunderstood me. What i meant is that 410 had no e-tt change on 11 Aug was because the 53/410 crossovers were already removed previously at an earlier date even before 14 Jul, as i have alr not been seeing them for a very long time. Hence what change 53 had did not affect 410 on 11 Aug.</p>
              <p>I was not saying that the change which 53 had on 11 Aug was for the removal of 53/410 crossovers</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS9C, there is still smrt 858 and smrt 969. How come smrt not announced yet? Are they in first phase or second phase (together with sbs 39, 109, 168)? Can't wait for smrt 858-1 stop to Changi and smrt 969 -1 stop to tampines mrt!!! Should be in 1st phase as I saw the red stickers cover up only sbs 39, 109, 168 on the first day. The rest of the numbers including smrt 858 and 969 are left exposed to all in full view. Furthermore smrt 969 will have double deckers soon! Shiok.</p>

              <p>From the services to call at TPE bus stop, seems like only those that turn left into Sengkang and right into Punggol are stopping here for now. All those that go further on TPE have not been announced.</p>
              <p>Is it because LTA does not want the speed on these services to be hampered and thinks that Jalan Kayu stop where 39/168/858 stop should be enough for transfer? </p>
              <p>Might be they are waiting to see the traffic pattern before throwing it open to more services.</p>

              <p>Erm. The thing is, if Sv 410 is affected (like what you said
              with removing the 53/410 x-overs), there would be a e-tt change
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>for both Sv 53
              &amp; 410</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>But like what I had mentioned earlier, the e-tt change on 11 Aug
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only affected Sv
              53</strong></span>. Sv 410's e-tt wasn't touched in this latest
              change. So I don't think it's due to removing any x-overs to Sv 410
              for this 11 Aug revision.<br> <br> But as to why Sv 410's last e-tt change was on 14 Jul, that might
              explain your 53/410 removal (ie. the 14 Jul change might be for the
              removal of that x-over, but not this 11 Aug e-tt change for Sv 53).
              Hope this clarifies your misunderstanding somewhat?</p>

              <p>sv 50 def needs WEG add... significantly high loading.. also needs SD --&gt; DD conversion</p>
              <p>sv 45 should be WEG add... because this service has many long distance travellers just like 161/168.. people who board at Serangoon, alight only Bedok onwards.</p>
              <p>sv 22.. not sure if really needed BSEP this one... route duplicates 65 all the way from Macpherson</p>
              <p>sv 72..  even with 05 minute frequency, loading is very high during peak hours... so maybe makes sense.. also PM at Tampines.. loading gone up again... guess new to higher occupancy around ave 6 where sv 72 is the only MRT direct service.</p>

              <p>I have to say 143M was just a nice to have but does not really provide significant advantage.. </p>
              <p>It does not connect any new areas... it pampers the same areas that have sv 79 with almost full fleet DD every 08-10 mins and sv 143 with almost full fleet DDs as well with 08-10 mins frequency. </p>
              <p>143M buses are picking up passengers, but if you observe, if 143M takes 50-60 pax, the bus behind 143 will pick almost no pax from Pandan to JE. Same goes for sv 79. sv 79 comes empty from Penjuru in AM to Teban and if 143M has called, sv 79 comes empty to interchange. Earlier sv 79 would get good 50-60 pax from Teban towards interchange. If sv 79 or 143 have called before, 143M goes empty. </p>
              <p>Bunching of 143M is inevitable with 143 or 79 since the frequency of other two services also quite good. </p>
              <p>It is a waste of resources according to me that could have been used for a new service some where else.</p>

Few days ago i was queueing up for Sv 51 to joyride then got one uncle queueing for Sv 79 asked me did Sv 79 just went off? I have been waiting here for 30 minutes. I said nope and i said uncle, why you never take 143/143M? He said he can only take 79 to his home in Teban? I said uncle, 79 is an industrial svc so Sundays u have to wait very long. When 79 finally came, he went up with a sigh. The amazing thing is those foreign workers waiting for 79 only queued up when 79 is arriving in 10 mins, which proves that they are smart enuf to queue for 79 when it is arriving.</p></div>

              <p>Well, we cannot totally replace Buses with Rail Transport. That's too expensive and so not feasible (I wonder why nowadays MRT stations are only 1km apart. shouldn't they be at least 2km apart to effectively separate the crowd and travel fast?)</p>
