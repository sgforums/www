              <p>All, today I realized something. For the TPE bus stop towards changi side, LTA made sbs 3 and 34 stop at different stops (bus stop 1a and bus stop 1b).</p>
              <p>For the TPE bus stop towards SLE side, LTA made sbs 3 and 34 stop at the same stop (bus stop 1a) which is furthest from the Punggol flyover. Think they foresee it will be easier for them to move out to turn right into Punggol. LTA made sbs 27, 88, 89, 89e stop at same stop (bus stop 1b) which is nearer the slip road towards sengkang. This makes it easier for those to turn into sengkang via Punggol rd. </p>

              <p>i feel the merger of 82 &amp; 107 route is still not too long. Rather, LTA should focus on long routes that pass through several bottlenecks and then amend it to skip some bottlenecks to improve service.</p>
              <p>if LTA wants to shorten long routes, then I rather they start cutting off those long loop services first and terminate from the existing loop point to a nearby Int or terminal. eg 36?</p>

              <p>I think it makes logical sense. Too many Punggol services terminate very soon, forcing most people to take MRT. If you have 107 extended, imagine many Punggol road residents who go to Potong Pasir, Bendemeer, Kallang can conveniently take 107, rather than doing 163 --&gt; MRT or doing 82 --&gt; MRT</p>
              <p>Plus 107 route to Shenton Way also quite fast... hence, will promote more people to use 107 which is not optimally used to its capacity today. </p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, that is why previously I have proposed a route from Punggol via sentul crescent, Punggol way, TPE, CTE, braddell rd, Thomson rd, newton rd, Scotts rd to loop at orchard rd. This totally skips sengkang and hougang and connects to city centre which there is no connection right now. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, I went down to see again. For direction towards SLE, 3, 34, 39, 109, 168, 858, 969 are all grouped together at bus stop 1a. So for turning into Punggol and those going straight, they make them easier by grouping them together at the stop furthest away from the flyover. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2656X, you are absolutely wrong. You mean from now till yr 2019 they will not do anything to Punggol? Haha. That is too long a time frame! There is still a long way to go for the hub! The condos and flats will be up even before 2016. How can it be even thinkable that all those new flats will have to wait until the hub is completed in order to have 1 or 2 new bus services? Haha! Just see how fast sbs 386 is introduced after the new flats at edgefield plains are completed. </p>
              <p>Hougang will not be avoided la. And do not ever hope they will implement such a long service from hougang to Boon Lay. They will tell you to take the MRT. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hougang Int is already having parking issues due to the high amount of bus services. Always jam up the entrance whenever it's raining.<br><br>There was a plan of Service 117 from Hougang to Bukit Batok back in 2001 but it was never introduced.<br><br>Punggol is ulu place for now, because introducing it within this year is a waste of resources for the PTOs since about 70% of the flats won't be fully constructed within this year. The other reason is the very obvious transport hub at TPE. Punggol residents are encouraged to access bus services from there. Furthermore it's pointless to introduce more Punggol routes towards the city because it'l definitely ply Punggol Road (Service 82, 83, 136, ), Punggol Way (43, 119) or Punggol East (50, 62, 85) and cause more duplications. NEL isn't there for no reason. If you still don't think so, wait until Sengkang West Avenue opens and service 85 or 965  will get a revamp to ply Yishun Avenue 1.</p>
