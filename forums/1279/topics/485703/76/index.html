              <p>If that's your point I agree... Ave 7 to WRI has so many
              services now + with many getting DD upgrades... there is huge
              capacity and seldom buses are full between Admiralty and Woodland
              MRT (while earlier they used to be).</p>
              <p>I also agree during route planning they should have planned the
              route better. There is missing link between Woodlands North and
              South which is undeniable and will be corrected to a small extent
              by TEL... but will benefit only those around MRT stop wanting to
              travel around those areas. </p>
              <p>904 should not have been a feeder, but a short trunk between
              Sembawang and Woodlands town, covering Woodlands crescent and dr
              62/75... this way it did not need to do ave 7. With the current
              routing, there is no alternative but the route to do ave 7,
              otherwise it will get more winding.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>problem is that not everyone who stay at 904 route take the mrt.. there are some paxes who take buses (161/168/960/963/966/187 etc) who alight at interchange and transfer to 904.. although the number might be small, but by going via Ave 7 is the most direct route for 904... </p>

              <p>Sv 72 first DD will be packed (80-90 pax), 2nd DD which will
              arrive right at back will have 40-50 pax.. and then you will have
              in another 2-3 mins another DD with around 30-40 pax... </p>
              <p>Basically many DDs getting wasted because of continuous
              bunching.. And there is no way to control bunching for a long route
              with 05 min frequency (during prime peak). </p>

              <p>Last Thursday I spotted a line of Enviros back to back at Raffles Town Club bus stop at around 7.10pm. The sequence was 190, 972, 190, 972, 960, 972, 972, 972 and then 190, with the first few buses full to front door all the way to a very empty bus at the back.</p>

              <p>972 and DTL basically serve different purposes. I'm not sure if many people would take bus from BPJ Ring Rd to BPJ MRT, take DTL to Newton, and again take NSL to Orchard.</p>

              <p>True, but it will lose the pax who alight at Whitley. And every bus you have around 15 pax that alight at Whitley and transfer to 153/186/154 etc. These can already do at Botanic Gardens MRT. </p>
