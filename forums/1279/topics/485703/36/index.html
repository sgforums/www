              <p>check through press release, no fleet add from SBST side during
              the period that 6678/6679 went in.. and 6401/6409 went in to sv53
              in short span as well.so dun think SBST will add another bus that
              time.. i remember last year, i did see 8161 running around, for a
              certain period, it keep doing sv138 as well.. </p>

              <p>Hmm okay, that makes more sense now. So means 8161S was probably in the same situation as 1990L is on Sv 15 currently. Supposed to be out but still on the ex-perm replacing another MIA bus. </p>

              <p>compared to last time, 27 loads to me have gone down slightly, but not much effect on the loading. I could board the 2nd bus compared to last time, when i had to wait for the 4th or 5th bus. Still waiting for pax to change to 969! 27 cant get DDs so lets hope that all the pax will change to 969 and 969 can get more DDs</p>

              <p>Actually I rather they shorten the bus stop length..it's kinda stupid when u alighted at bus stop 1A and you have to run so much to catch buses at 1B, what if it's the last bus and you have drivers that do not wait for you??</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, the bus stop must be long enough so that 4 buses can come at the same time. The occurrence for such services to all come at same time is high. If not, traffic will pile up. That is worse. </p>
              <p>For the scenario you give, it is natural that human beings do not plan their journey until to the last minute. If people really want to do that, then they have to take such risks. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr TIB429E, haha i think you never go see during peak hours morning and peak hours evening weekdays. 4 buses coming together is a very common sight during those timings. Cheers.</p>
              <p>Haha. That is not very possible. Maybe once in 30 times you will get a 20 min wait. The frequencies of those buses are less than 20 min even at off-peak hours. The buses at TPE stops are very popular services. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Not possible? You should go try~ Out of 3 tries at the stop[for me], 2 of it were peak hours...and it happen that there's heavy jams that drags the waiting time to 20mins :) cheers~</p>

              <p>Wrong! </p>
              <p>Even during peak at most 2 buses only, or 3-4 of there are jams. 4 buses ALL THE TIME is an <span style="line-height: 1.231;">exaggeration, at least for now.</span></p>
              <p>And btw lemme give you some enlightenment: 858 has a 85% rate of running off schedule, 109 has 70%. During the 85% 858 buses can arrive in timings up to 27 minutes during PEAK, and 32 during off peak. 109 can come in 21 minutee too. This was a study done by a friend of mine who once worked in Transitlink. And I cant prove him wrong either! Once a daily commuter of 109, freq often go super erraric during peak starting from PSR, leave alone TPE! 858? Needless to explain.</p>
