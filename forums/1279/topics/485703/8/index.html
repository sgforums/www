              <p>And to your point with COE for cars getting so expensive, even
              people living in condos need to be provided with bus services with
              good frequencies. Also, many people whose COE expires will not get
              a new car.</p>
              <p>I had two cars. I did not renew my COE for one and I use only
              public transport. Now just have one car for family as they dont
              like using public transport. Spoilt, I tell you!</p>

              <p>Hi mr sgbuses, yes based on speed only and nothing else. Take note that speed does not equate to attractiveness of a method of transportation. Cheers!</p>

              <p>I would like to make a suggestion to enhance the bus fleet of feeder service 242 (Boon Lay Int to Jurong West St72/Ave5/St71/Ave4). </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I have been hearing people complain about how under-capacity the service is, but had never observed it myself, since I commute on 243, not 242. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A few days ago, at around 5:30pm, I went to experience boarding 242 at Boon Lay Bus Interchange, and I was shocked to see how long the line was. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The length was similar to the waiting line for 179 in the morning, except this only went to the bubble tea shop area, not to Old Chang Kee and beyond (outside Jurong Point). Anyway, it was bad enough. </span></p>
              <p>I wanted to go to West Grove area, that's why I queued for 242. When the bus arrived, it was a Scania KUB Single Deck bus. When I was at the first row, the bus was already full and could not pick up anymore people. So I did not manage to board. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">In the end, I took 192 instead and alighted at Pioneer Mall area.</span></p>
              <p>It seems that on average, one has to wait for the second bus before he can board 242 at around 5:30pm. If 5:30pm have to wait for second bus then can board, I guess one has to wait for the third bus (second bus, if one is a Double Decker) before he can board 242 at around 7pm.</p>
              <p>I think SBS Transit should replace around one single deck bus with a Double Decker bus at around 5:30pm on weekdays. At around 6:30pm-8pm when the demand for 242 <em>(actually, this also applies to all services serving HDB areas)</em> is highest, SBS Transit should replace around two to three single deck buses with DDs.</p>
              <p>That is if 192 and 193 still ply Jurong West Street 64 and Ave 4 even after Joo Koon Bus Interchange opens. It seems that a number of N7 people use 192 and 193 as an alternative to 242. If 192 and 193 no longer ply St64 and Ave4, I think 242 should have a full-DD fleet during peak hours instead, as having the above-suggested enhancement may not be sufficient.</p>
              <p>In short,</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Short-term (Now): replace 1-3 Single Deck buses with the same number of DDs for 242.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Long-term (if no more 192 and 193): deploy full-DD fleet on 242 during peak hours.</span></li>

              <p>I had raised this point sometime back as well because PM at Boon Lay, I have the same observation. I think bet 6.30pm and 8pm can def have the SDs replaced by DDs using crossover DDs from 179/179A like it is done for 241.</p>
              <p>AM peak, loading is still manageable, but PM I think it gets worse bcoz lot of non-office ppl also go to Boon Lay for shopping/socializing. </p>
              <p>In general, perm should be 4 SDs, 2 DDs. </p>

              <p>I believe there's quite a lot of those DDs perm on Sv 2 which are on S-Shifts instead of full-day.. Convert more of those S-Shifts into Full-Day slots, or switch the full-day SDs with the S-Shift DDs with regards to their timings and you are 80-90% solving the problem already.</p>
