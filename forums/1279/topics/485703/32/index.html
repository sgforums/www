              <p>I really hope that 39, 168 and 858 can now skip Jln Kayu. It is a waste of time, and to a lesser extent, operating costs. The recent addition of yet another junction at the entrance to SLE meant another 2 mins into journey time for northbound buses.</p>
              <p>The loading on these svcs is just too high and the amount of native pax from is just too little; many of these pax are transfer pax from 103 at Jln Kayu and Fernvale area of YCK road (they can take the more frequent 86 and transfer at TPE to the east or 85/851/854 to the north) , or simply transfer pax betweem the mentioned svcs.</p>
              <p>As for those coming out from the Camp, the amount is just not justifiable enough for the other vast majority to stop for them and hence waste at least 10-15 mins of their time. Especially with the addition of the TPE stop now, the svcs will really go bonkers and there is a need to keep up with the express speeds to deal with the increasing demands of this svc. </p>
              <p>So it's just a matter of cost here. Skip TPE, and residents of the two growing giants would be as loss. Skip Jln Kayu and camp personnel will be affected. Stop both and the thousands of commuters from the hearts of two Singaporean areas, most who may have been relying on the service for years, will be the suffering crowd.</p>

              <p>Hi mr smb128b, this is totally not possible. People around those areas need transfer to sbs 39, 168 and smrt 858. </p>
              <p>These are not additional services and they just need bypass the stops. If follow your suggestion to take them out, residents around jalan Kayu end up complaining and LTA may be forced to introduce new routes or even reinstate the above mentioned services. So the cost issue may not stand if end up new routes need to be introduced.</p>
              <p>The basic understanding is if the bus stop is along the way of the bus services, they shall stop there. The same reasoning applies for the TPE stop. Cheers.</p>

              <p>No choice so have to... if with bags... prefer to take 858 direct. If not, then stupid to take 858 when can take 168 to jalan kayu and change to  858. </p>

              <p>I think should be for Corporation road... the new HDBs there have only 178 as of now which is v unreliable... also hope there is a service along International road... as this is neglected part of industrial hub. </p>
