              <p>Decent loading dosent mean that it warrants DDs ~ Like this even 284 can get DD since it got decent loading too~ From the pic on FB the VSO on 136 had only 1 pax on the upper deck and less than 7 pax on board. The pax from AMK also dw to move up to upper deck ~ If 22,24 or 262 comes, the pax heading to teck ghee/lor chuan would take any of the bus svcs and not 136 <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">. 136 another " Troll Service "? ~</p>

              <p>I still dont think 136 needs DDs.. I used to take 136 from AMK to Kovan and i am one of the few pax travelling beyond AMK and the KUB had little/no standees.. AM peak students going to sch if u realise AM peak without the students 136 DDs can be half full yes 136 need DDs for the students going to school but evening peak wise dunnid.. I agree with sbst191 cause when 22/24/262 comes the pax queuing for 136 just jump queue to whichever one of these svcs is coming as u noe AMK int same prob as boon lay there is no sight of buses approaching the berths for the pax..</p>

              <p>Hi mr Acx1688, haha. I see this everyday. Big enough. Not much

                      convinced now. To add on, sbs 27 is not really fully packed all the
                      time. There are some spaces to get onto it from this stop.

              <p>Firstly, there hasn't been any detractors. If you classified what some of us had said (including me) as "words from detractors", then I can only say everyone is entitled to their opinions. I can understand your overflowing enthusiasm (since the stop is right at your doorstep and serves you convinience). But a local resident (you) would have different opinions from a pax on a bus svc that passes by that stop (basically the rest of us) anyway. Be more receptive to opinions from others. This is a forum after all, LOL.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I do notice that during Peak Hours the crowds at these 2 stops haven't been as huge as i expected. Probably because the svcs that would give high loading at these 2 stops haven't started stopping yet at these stops. (Sv 168, 969 etc).</p>
              <p>Thirdly, what Acx1688 said isn't wrong with regards to buses not jamming within the bus bay, but I'm not so sure if other motorists would view the same way. There isn't any marking before that bus bay to tell motorists to avoid the bus bay? (or is there?)<br>I mean logically people would avoid driving into the bus bay. But if there's a huge jam on the main car lanes, I still foresee some goondus cutting into the bus bay to save time. </p>
              <p>Yeaps, that's about it. Just my opinions.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, firstly yes initially got many detractors la. Some say this service will not stop there and some say other bus services should not stop there even if the route is on the way. Secondly, of course, an additional bus stop with some services where people can take at other stops too. When 39, 109, 168, 858, and 969 are implemented, you can expect more people. Thirdly, there are markings saying the lanes are for bus only. I think you never see carefully. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, on normal days without incidents, cars definitely will abide. But I cannot say if there is a heavy jam due to accidents or super heavy traffic. There is also a No entry signal on the sides of the road just before the bus stop. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, firstly yes initially got many detractors la.
              Some say this service will not stop there and some say other bus
              services should not stop there even if the route is on the way.
              Secondly, of course, an additional bus stop with some services
              where people can take at other stops too. When 39, 109, 168, 858,
              and 969 are implemented, you can expect more people. Thirdly, there
              are markings saying the lanes are for bus only. I think you never
              see carefully. Cheers.</p>

              <p>But did you see... it is getting implemented in phases... not like what you said... all will stop... LTA is playing a wait and see game to halt other services there..</p>
              <p>If only 3/34/27/88/89 stops... it gives little convenience to ppl.. bcoz those who would otherwise transfer at Punggol road or aft TPE stop will do it on TPE... doesn't really make a world of a difference.</p>
              <p>Real difference will come when 39/168/858/969 can stop... Especially with 858 ppl will have the most benefit... For others like 858/969/39 Yishun bound, ppl still have 85/965 within Sengkang town.. To Woodlands still got 161.. So major benefit comes with quick transfer to CGA.. </p>
              <p>Need to soon implement 858M between CGA and TPE bus stop... coz I wonder how is it going to manage load... with all sensible ppl on 34/27 should transfer to 858 at TPE if going to CGA.</p>

              <p>Hi mr busanalyser, the rest of the bus services, 39, 109, 168, 858. 969 will most probably come by this month end. These are the services which residents previously appeal to the MP before the TPE stops were built. Super direct to changi airport, super direct to tampines int, one route to sembawang, one route to bedok!</p>
              <p>They are not interested in 3, 27, 34, 88, 89 stopping at TPE bus stop. Cheers.</p>
