You didnt need One North when Kent Ridge and Buona Vista are so close... same way why do you need Caldecott which almost has nothing around it (every time I take CCL, almost 4-5 people are on platform).. when you have Bishan closeby... same goes with Mountbatten and Dakota - both are so close (should have had just one station instead of two).

              <p>TEL the whole sector a bit screw up, Woodlands side is okay, Sin Ming is only worth it after CIL, Napier sector redundant IMO, first CBD area from east side is Shenton Way. A but long from MP to Orchard. If from East Coast to Woodlands, 168 might be faster than TEL</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>But can't simply look at the number of train cars. I'd rather
              have 4 cars at 2mins interval than 6 cars at 3min or even 8 cars at
              4mins. A compromise has to be made somewhere. Afterall it is a
              medium density line (If you don't understand the concept, look at
              U-bahn services in Germany).</p>
              <p>What I really don't like as well is the high density of stops.
              It is as if you are planning a new bus route that stops every 800m
              instead of 400m, except that it is on a track and in tunnels. Makes
              it suffer all the disadvantages of buses (many stops), trains (long
              dwell times, high building cost - probably 20 to 30bil this time
              for the whole TEL) and making it really not comparable with the
              comfort and speed of cars.</p>
              <p>They just don't seem to be looking towards making something that
              car users will want to utilise, but rather to just force them use
              public transport by lowering the COE quota/quantity.</p>

              <p>Heh. </p>
              <p>Freq all right. </p>
              <p>CCL currently has the worst freq of all existing MRT lines, what is your say to THAT?</p>
              <p>High amount of transit pax + short trains + atrocious freq just equals to a completely screwed up line. </p>
              <p>Fleet add? I don't believe in THAT anymore. The delivery for the C151A is already nearing completion and there are alr so many of those trains here and there, YET I have to suffer 5 min freq during weekends and get my face shoved on the EWL. In other words, fleet add =/= service improvement!</p>
              <p>Soon DTL will be coming to my house, at Upp Changi. But I won't be taking that. I mean, slow (both in terms of stops and speed) and crowded trains to city?! No wonder so many SGreans lust for cars.</p>
              <p>I really like your last two paragraphs - really expressed my sentiments accurately. SG gov must think of improving their PT, rather than forcing COE prices up blatantly! They keep thinking it is the people's fault and responsibility, without even looking at themselves! There is a lack of check and balance!</p>
              <p>I think they are convinced that since CCL has so many pax it is alright to build more stops in lines but no! CCL is totally different story! Purpose of CCL is to connect transit passengers, thus forgivable for the high amount of stops. But definitely not the case for DTL and TEL, where they are serving people TO THE CITY, not TO MRT INTERCHANGES! And it's bullshit they are using 4-car on TEL because the route is too long and serving high-density areas eg. Marine Parade and I seriously don't think LTA would bloody bother to deploy trains to at least the standard 2-3 min freq during weekends and 2 min during peak!</p>

              <p>Heh. </p>
              <p>Freq all right. </p>
              <p>CCL currently has the worst freq of all existing MRT lines, what
              is your say to THAT?</p>
              <p>High amount of transit pax + short trains + atrocious freq just
              equals to a completely screwed up line. </p>
              <p>Fleet add? I don't believe in THAT anymore. The delivery for the
              C151A is already nearing completion and there are alr so many of
              those trains here and there, YET I have to suffer 5 min freq during
              weekends and get my face shoved on the EWL. In other words, fleet
              add =/= service improvement!</p>
              <p>Soon DTL will be coming to my house, at Upp Changi. But I won't
              be taking that. I mean, slow (both in terms of stops and speed) and
              crowded trains to city?! No wonder so many SGreans lust for
              cars.</p>
              <p>I really like your last two paragraphs - really expressed my
              sentiments accurately. SG gov must think of improving their PT,
              rather than forcing COE prices up blatantly! They keep thinking it
              is the people's fault and responsibility, without even looking at
              themselves! There is a lack of check and balance!</p>
              <p>I think they are convinced that since CCL has so many pax it is
              alright to build more stops in lines but no! CCL is totally
              different story! Purpose of CCL is to connect transit passengers,
              thus forgivable for the high amount of stops. But definitely not
              the case for DTL and TEL, where they are serving people TO THE
              CITY, not TO MRT INTERCHANGES! And it's bullshit they are using
              4-car on TEL because the route is too long and serving high-density
              areas eg. Marine Parade and I seriously don't think LTA would
              bloody bother to deploy trains to at least the standard 2-3 min
              freq during weekends and 2 min during peak!</p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS2656X, your reasoning does not link to the initial
              statements which you make. You say LTA will not be touching anymore
              on Punggol and hougang until much longer later which definitely
              will not be true. </p>
              <p>You say hougang int is already having parking issues due to the
              high amount of bus services. Then why introduce 1 more bus service
              in sept to further worsen it?</p>
              <p>Back in yr 2001, objective then is different from nowadays. Ever
              since NEL was opened, long routes to North east were all
              rationalized. Current route introduction are all quite short. So
              seriously you think they still will give you such a long route from
              hougang to Boon Lay?</p>
              <p>We are not saying to introduce any more routes in Punggol in yr
              2014. But there will not be a hub until yr 2019-2020. Punggol
              Watertown Mall is up in end yr 2015 but that is not a hub. So going
              by your earlier statements, there will not be bus service
              introduced from 2015 till 2019? How will those people in new flats
              react? </p>
              <p>Whoever says introduce new bus services by Punggol way, Punggol
              road or Punggol east will just cause duplications? You think they
              will not ply other different routes once it is out of Punggol. 1 or
              2 similar roads do not make it a full duplication. In other
              estates, some have few bus services having similar roads out ot
              that estates, so Punggol should be no different.  </p>
              <p>Take note they are also building a new Punggol highway road deep
              inside which will directly link Punggol road to pasir ris which
              will not go through TPE. This will connect those waterway flats to
              pasir ris and will also need new bus services. Next time, TPE may
              not be that frequently used by Punggol residents once this inter
              town road link is up by end 2015!</p>
              <p>Your last statement is indeed strange! What sengkang west
              avenue??? Service 85 or 965 why need goes by yishun ave 1 which is
              accessible through seletar west link from Punggol. Current route by
              TPE and SLE to lentor and yishun ave 2 for 85 and to woodlands for
              965 will be sufficient and good enough. Cheers. </p>

              <p>Yes, DTL is somehow better planned, but if they had a bypass tunnel Jalan Besar and Rochor it would be even better. It defeats the purpose of it being a effective alternative to EWL just because of the detour into marina bay. Ends up it would still be faster to take a bus directly (66, 67 anyone) that bypass the city center. Don't even talk about driving.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is a way for the gov't to improve land prices around the stations, so the more the merrier.</p>

              <p>Yes, DTL is somehow better planned, but if they had a bypass
              tunnel Jalan Besar and Rochor it would be even better. It defeats
              the purpose of it being a effective alternative to EWL just because
              of the detour into marina bay. Ends up it would still be faster to
              take a bus directly (66, 67 anyone) that bypass the city center.
              Don't even talk about driving.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is a way for the gov't to improve land prices around

              <p>Heh. </p>
              <p>Freq all right. </p>
              <p>CCL currently has the worst freq of all existing MRT lines, what
              is your say to THAT?</p>
              <p>High amount of transit pax + short trains + atrocious freq just
              equals to a completely screwed up line. </p>
              <p>Fleet add? I don't believe in THAT anymore. The delivery for the
              C151A is already nearing completion and there are alr so many of
              those trains here and there, YET I have to suffer 5 min freq during
              weekends and get my face shoved on the EWL. In other words, fleet
              add =/= service improvement!</p>
              <p>Soon DTL will be coming to my house, at Upp Changi. But I won't
              be taking that. I mean, slow (both in terms of stops and speed) and
              crowded trains to city?! No wonder so many SGreans lust for
              cars.</p>
              <p>I really like your last two paragraphs - really expressed my
              sentiments accurately. SG gov must think of improving their PT,
              rather than forcing COE prices up blatantly! They keep thinking it
              is the people's fault and responsibility, without even looking at
              themselves! There is a lack of check and balance!</p>
              <p>I think they are convinced that since CCL has so many pax it is
              alright to build more stops in lines but no! CCL is totally
              different story! Purpose of CCL is to connect transit passengers,
              thus forgivable for the high amount of stops. But definitely not
              the case for DTL and TEL, where they are serving people TO THE
              CITY, not TO MRT INTERCHANGES! And it's bullshit they are using
              4-car on TEL because the route is too long and serving high-density
              areas eg. Marine Parade and I seriously don't think LTA would
              bloody bother to deploy trains to at least the standard 2-3 min
              freq during weekends and 2 min during peak!</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Well that's the whole point!</p>
              <p>If you doubled the amount of cars to 6 per trainset on CCL, the frequency would be even worse.</p>
              <p>Problem is the lack of foresight to order additional trains early enough to cater for increased demand on some sections. They did that a little late and the 24 sets representing 60% increase in trainsets will only come in from later this year.</p>
              <p>If you are still seeing 5 minutes frequency on weekends, you should feedback to SMRT. On the other end of the EWL i'm getting on avg 3 mins on weekends, which is pretty decent. Also, the automated lines are easier to add trains too, don't need to plan for TO.</p>

              <p>I can tell you that if there happens to be a bus service passing

              <p>Hi mr SBS2656X, why will it be redundant??? Do you know that there are many flats deep inside the waterway built? So many HDB flats and condos are coming up. You need at least half a dozen of new bus services, not just 1 bus service. Those flats are not within the reach of the TPE stop.</p>
              <p>109? There is the crowded no 3 inside Punggol central to pasir ris. There are 88, 89 and 89e on the outskirts of TPE outside Punggol. So? The road is built much further inside for residents to have another alternative to TPE. You can just imagine the number of cars inside.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Punggol will be the biggest estate soon. Yr by yr, the number of people is increasing at a fast pace! We can foresee many more services coming in. Cheers.</p>

              <p>The problem with CCL now is the additional CCLe. That was unplanned for, and during the peak hours, almost all of the trains will be in service, and during off peak, most of the trains will need to go for servicing. And occasionally some would show problems in the middle of revenue service and had to be called off from service.<br><br>The fleet they ordered was enough for CCL, but with CCLe, it wasn't.<br><br></p>
