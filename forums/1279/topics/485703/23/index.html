              <p>The problem with CCL now is the additional CCLe. That was

              need to go for servicing. And occasionally some would show problems

              <p>This rumour has been passed around for quite some time.</p>
              <p>I choose not to trust that, because CCLe is just 2 stations out of 31.</p>
              <p>If a fleet of trains cannot cope with 2 additional stations, then how would it be sufficient for the 29 stations in the first place?</p>

              <p>Yes, DTL is somehow better planned, but if they had a bypass
              tunnel Jalan Besar and Rochor it would be even better. It defeats
              the purpose of it being a effective alternative to EWL just because
              of the detour into marina bay. Ends up it would still be faster to
              take a bus directly (66, 67 anyone) that bypass the city center.
              Don't even talk about driving.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is a way for the gov't to improve land prices around
              the stations, so the more the merrier.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I think DTL is Bukit Panjang to CBD and Tampines/Bedok Reservoir to city. LTA does not care to connect Bukit Timah to Serangoon road.. and maybe wants people to use bus here.. Surely bus will be faster as just Chinatown-Bugis stretch takes 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Even Chinatown to Bugis, I thought will affect loading on sv 2/12 big time but even now PM peaks, you see 40-45 pax board at Chinatown and around 30-35 pax alight at Bugis. </p>

              <p>Service 10, I noticed it also. I took before PM peak from Mountbatten to Kent Ridge on a Friday, and the amount of pax isn't even able to fill the bus to a quarter full. What's more on the stop itself another DD on 10 also came and overtook. And both the bus I am in and the other DD bunched all the way to Kent Ridge. Whilst waiting for 151e, about 6 more DDs on 10 arrived within 5 minutes, which none of them are even filled up by a quarter.</p>

              <p>Well that's the whole point!</p>
              <p>If you doubled the amount of cars to 6 per trainset on CCL, the
              frequency would be even worse.</p>
              <p>Problem is the lack of foresight to order additional trains
              early enough to cater for increased demand on some sections. They
              did that a little late and the 24 sets representing 60% increase in
              trainsets will only come in from later this year.</p>
              <p>If you are still seeing 5 minutes frequency on weekends, you
              should feedback to SMRT. On the other end of the EWL i'm getting on
              avg 3 mins on weekends, which is pretty decent. Also, the automated
              lines are easier to add trains too, don't need to plan for TO.</p>

              <p>I think DTL is Bukit Panjang to CBD and Tampines/Bedok Reservoir
              to city. LTA does not care to connect Bukit Timah to Serangoon
              road.. and maybe wants people to use bus here.. Surely bus will be
              faster as just Chinatown-Bugis stretch takes 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>Even Chinatown to Bugis, I thought will affect loading on sv
              2/12 big time but even now PM peaks, you see 40-45 pax board at
              Chinatown and around 30-35 pax alight at Bugis. </p>

              <p>It's literally one road down...</p>
              <p>Nowadays I also like to alight from EWL at Bugis and change to 2/12 to Clarke Quay and Chinatown, faster and cheaper...</p>
