              <p>Agreed agreed agreed. Don't know what psychological issue AMDEP/HGDEP have... BNDEP is deploying its DDs on short feeders as well, now plying DDs on 3A/3B. Definitely the routes of 265/269/315 are longer and can do well with DDs.</p>

              <p>Hmm, no worries. I was just asking because as of a few days ago, when i was onboard the Sv 89 &amp; 109 DDs, the depot isn't functioning yet uh. Just that they (once again) stored like 7-8 new-new Citaros in the middle of the depot under the sunlight. <br><br>I say new-new because those Citaros were with shiny bodies and shiny rims. </p>
              <p>So yeah, the depot is almost done up. But not functioning yet. </p>

              <p>HAHA yeah. Still remember that there was a period of 6 consecutive quarters back then (ie, total of a 1.5years period) in which every 3 months Sv 39 got a KUB fleet add. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway my point was that, IMO, i think Sv 39 &amp; 85 should stick with their current fleet though. If any of the 2 svcs does get another DD (note: i'm saying DD, if SD fleet add, still sounds reasonable), I don't think it's fair in comparison to the other service that didn't get. </p>

              <p>For Sv 39 uh, <br><br>1) the pax load actually dropped off quite considerably after 103 was extended to Yishun though. I can't quite figure out why, but I noticed that there wasn't as many people who would transfer at the Seletar bus stop from Sv 39 nowadays compared to last time.<br><br>2) the pax load for Sv 39 only starts building up after 1745hrs+ (or if you want a round-figure, 6pm onwards) from Yishun. That's the time when most of the army personnel from the nearby camps &amp; almost everyone else knocks off from work. I've taken trips of different timings in the 5pm-6pm sector before on Weekdays, and the pax load for a trip at 1730hrs+ really differs by a whole lot compared to the next trip at say, 1745hrs+.</p>
              <p>I've observed that 3 out of the 4 DDs on Sv 39 are on full-day shifts though. (they run till the last few timings each day).

              <p><br>I think the reason why 103 has not picked up loading from Yishun Ave 11 is because of its terrible frequency compared to 806. The last time I waited at Yishun Ave 11 towards Yishun Temp Int (during off-peak, though), literally five 806 buses have called at the stop before 103 came. And all the 806 buses cleared all pax at the bus stop, except 1 auntie who was going to KTPH. In the end, even that auntie gave up and decided to walk there.</p>
              <p>It seems that AM peak people take whatever come first, hence the poor loading on 103 compared to 806.</p>

              <p>Anyway, let's wait for a few more months and see if 103 starts to receive more pax. Last time 2 months after the extension of svc 35, only 10 pax took 35 at Alps Ave during evening peak. And now... 35 got spammed with DDs.</p>
