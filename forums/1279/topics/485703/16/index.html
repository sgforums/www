              <p>Well, we cannot totally replace Buses with Rail Transport.
              That's too expensive and so not feasible (I wonder why nowadays MRT
              stations are only 1km apart. shouldn't they be at least 2km apart
              to effectively separate the crowd and travel fast?)</p>

              <p>All, LTA announced the new East coast mrt line, extended from
              Thomson line. With this announcement, we should know that bus
              services will always play a second fiddle to the MRT which is their
              main mode of public transport. With this being implemented in Yr
              2024, buses along those territories will be made just sufficient to
              handle the load. We do not expect any major shake-up in the bus
              services around there. Neither will we expect any new services at
              those areas. Cheers.</p>

              <p>The East Coast Line (previously known as Eastern Region Line) is not new in the first place. It was already announced in 2008 as an MRT line under planning. So there is no point in saying all this suddenly just because the line is finally announced, as if bus is not 'a second fiddle to the MRT' if ECL is not announced recently. And also, I would still expect new services in these areas to bring people to the new MRT stations.</p>

              <p>Anyway, I noticed that buses looks like they enter from east side (Near temp bus stop) and exit from west side (Near temp Int). This may cause some congestion issues at the stretch between the two entrance/exit. Buses that arrive from Nth Ave 1/Chai Chee could use Nth St 1 on their return trip first.</p>

              <p>That uncle was definitely not well informed.. If not 79, he could take 143/143M and if he lives closer to Penjuru can take 78 as well. You have monitor with bus timing at Jurong interchange. He should have checked. There are around 5 monitors in the interchange close to each boarding bay.Â </p>

              <p>Also bus services are not planned for foreign workers who live in dorms. If u see so many dorms are around a km away from nearest bus stop. I don't think PTOs or LTA cares about them. Sv 79 loading usually very poor on Sundays/PH. There is a reason why frequency is so low. You see weekdays. Peak hour bus every 08 mins or so now if not late.Â </p>

              <p>Idk how you'll view it, but I realised that those first few svcs which SBST announced are using the new bus stops from 24 Aug are the ones which are turning left or right at the next immediate junction.Â </p>
              <p>I think they're trying to gauge the traffic flow on both sides during Peak Hours with the new bus stops. There's always a huge jam during Peak on the slip road up from TPE to Punggol Road. And the svcs which SBST said are going to use the bus stops first, are the same ones which are going to be stuck in the same jam before the opening of the bus stops anyway.Â <br><br>This is important, because the jam up the slip road can easily add at 5mins or more to the runtime of all the other svcs which have yet to use that bus stop and are not turning at the next immediate junction (ie. Sv 39, 109, 168, 858, 969) during Peak Hours. Sv 88 always get stuck there for more than 5 mins before turning left to the Blk 190C bus stop during Peak.</p>

              <p>It's actually wiser to split the bus svcs up between the 2 stops along the same stretch and mix those which are not turning at the next immediate junction (ie Sv 39, 109, 168, 858, 969) with those svcs which are turning at the next junction. (Sv 3, 27, 34, 88, 89, 89e).</p>
              <p>Just think about the chaotic situation at one bus stop if all those svcs which are not turning are grouped together &amp; have buses coming together at the same time. It will be super crazy and crowded if 2x Sv 969 buses + 2x Sv 858 MANs + 1x Sv 39 / 109 / 168 arrive at the same time at the same bus stop. And that's what usually will happen during Peak for those svcs.<br><br>Likewise for the other 5 svcs if they're grouped in the same bus stop. Will result in one bus stop being super filled with buses, while the buses calling at the other stop can't get through to their stop because that slip road LTA created is only that wide.Â <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, why you say M terrace and siglap are probably??? Those stations locations are already announced. Not probably anymore. Marina terrace station is next to the current marine parade NPC. Siglap station is near laguna park condo which is next to victoria school. Cheers.</p>

              <p>It's actually wiser to split the bus svcs up between the 2 stops
              along the same stretch and mix those which are not turning at the
              next immediate junction (ie Sv 39, 109, 168, 858, 969) with those
              svcs which are turning at the next junction. (Sv 3, 27, 34, 88, 89,
              89e).</p>
              <p>Just think about the chaotic situation at one bus stop if all
              those svcs which are not turning are grouped together &amp; have
              buses coming together at the same time. It will be super crazy and
              crowded if 2x Sv 969 buses + 2x Sv 858 MANs + 1x Sv 39 / 109 / 168
              arrive at the same time at the same bus stop. And that's what
              usually will happen during Peak for those svcs.<br> <br> Likewise for the other 5 svcs if they're grouped in the same bus
              stop. Will result in one bus stop being super filled with buses,
              while the buses calling at the other stop can't get through to
              their stop because that slip road LTA created is only that
              wide.Â <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Agreed. All I am saying is 39 with 858 and 969 would have made more sense. It could be clubbed with 3 and 34.</p>
