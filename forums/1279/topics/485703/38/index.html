              <p>128 is doing just about fine. It is more of an option. Some buses 35-40 pax... some get 50-55 pax but hardly ever crosses that. </p>
              <p>The route of 128 is at fault. Had it been express along AMK Ave 6, Marymount rather than parallel to MRT, definitely many more would have taken it. But you will hardly see anyone board at AMK MRT or Bishan MRT in AM considering that MRT is so much faster. There are "few".</p>

              <p>868 is relatively popular among Bukit Batok and Toh Guan residents. Both AM peak trips are packed from the first few stops in BBT already. In fact it should start using high-capacity buses.</p>

              <p>I'm thinking Sv 3, 89 and 403 might stop by this stop instead of the current bus stop once it's completed. After all, it's just one junction ahead. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>They might be doing something with the covered linkways from the MRT station to the current Sv 3 bus stop. (perhaps a new temp Int? seems highly likely). otherwise really no reason for them to build a new stop a few 100m ahead. </p>

              <p>Hi mr SBS 9631X, I think this is solely for sbs 3. Because sbs 89 and sbs 403 do not go by this road. It is also not possible to re-route sbs 89 to travel on this route as it does not make a huge difference to its current pasir ris central now. </p>
              <p>New temporary pasir ris interchange is not possible. I think the main purpose is to serve a lot of flats which are nearer the other side. They will walk much lesser to the new bus stop. Remember LTA is busy providing more doorstep services to the residents. So distance of 50-100 metres from stop to flat is on their mind and being implemented. Cheers. </p>

              <p>so you mean sbs 3 will halt at Pasir Ris central + interchange on its way to Tampines? That is totally unecessary IMO. Unless, they make sv 3 not call interchange at all. This way all st 21 pax will be forced to go there to take sv 3.. and those for ave 4 will solely rely on sv 17/358. This maybe a way to make sure st 21 pax always get to enter sv 3 as today, when sv 3 comes, a lot of ave 4 pax also board, who can otherwise take sv 17. </p>

From what I could see, this bus stop seems to be more on the extension of Pasir Ris Dr 8, rather than the existing Pasir Ris Ctrl. My guess is that when the extension is completed, there will be some road realignments to make the west branch of Pasir Ris Ctrl connected with Pasir Ris Dr 8 only rather than the east branch of Pasir Ris Ctrl. As a result sv 3 will have to turn to Pasir Ris Ctrl at the junction of Dr 8, calling at the new stop, and skipping the existing bus stops along Pasir Ris Ctrl. (Just saying)</p>

              there will be some road realignments to make the west branch of
              Pasir Ris Ctrl connected with Pasir Ris Dr 8 only rather than the
              east branch of Pasir Ris Ctrl. As a result sv 3 will have to turn
              to Pasir Ris Ctrl at the junction of Dr 8, calling at the new stop,
              and skipping the existing bus stops along Pasir Ris Ctrl. (Just
              saying)</p>

              <p>Hi mr array88, this is also possible, taking into account that the land there needs to be empty as per current condition and the roads need to be aligned for the mrt linkage from pasir ris to punggol for cross-region line in yr 2030. Cheers.</p>

              <p>I dont see the point then of adding that one extra stop if it would anyway enter interchange. I would have thought they are doing so, so that pax on bus save 5 mins when the bus enters interchange and also so that st 21 residents have a dedicated stop, and not have to share sv with ave 4 residents as well (who will then move to sv 17 only).</p>

              <p>Hi mr ButIAmAToilet, in view of all these latest developments, I feel that they need to introduce 3E straight from Punggol to Pasir ris interchange and vice versa in the other direction. Skip TPE stop and all pasir ris stops and terminate at pasir ris int.</p>
              <p>This is because over the recent years, they have added some stops, namely TPE stop, 1 more stop along pasir ris drive 1 (Blk 612) and soon another stop along pasir ris central before finally reaching interchange. So there are total 3 new stops being introduced and the journey is being prolonged. Cheers.</p>
